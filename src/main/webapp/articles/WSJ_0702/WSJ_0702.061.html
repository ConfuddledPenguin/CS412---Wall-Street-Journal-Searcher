	<div class="article-body"><p>Where does the small investor go</p>
<p>When the market sharply declines?</p>
<p>Once the stocks reach their bottom,</p>
<p>He moves to the sidelines.</p>
<p>And there he prudently stays</p>
<p>Through each daily groan and creak,</p>
<p>And then boldly rushes in</p>
<p>As the market reaches peak.</p>
<p>-- Arnold J. Zarett.</p>

<p>Recovery Rooms</p>
<p>Our hale-and-hearty weekend athletes,</p>
<p>In their tough workouts never shirk,</p>
<p>Knowing after the sweating and straining,</p>
<p>There'll be five days to relax at work.</p>
<p>-- Edward F. Dempsey.</p>
