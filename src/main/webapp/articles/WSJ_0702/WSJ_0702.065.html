	<p class="article-leader">OUTRAGE IN SWITZERLAND</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A new book titled "Switzerland Washes Whiter" is provoking
outrage among many Swiss.</p>
<p>The work, by Jean Ziegler, attacks money laundering, which
the author claims supports Swiss society. "Switzerland is our
planet's principal junction for money laundering, the
recycling of the profits of death," the book says.</p>
<p>Already a best-seller at home and due to appear soon in 14
languages abroad, the book has prompted lawsuits, death
threats, villification in the media (the tabloid Blick called
the author a "bird that fouls its own nest") and a statement
from the Swiss Bankers Association saying that "Swiss banking
secrecy . . . does not protect criminals."</p>
<p>The Swiss passed a law last year under which anyone
knowingly hiding the origins of illegal profits faces a fine
or imprisonment. But Mr. Ziegler isn't impressed. Under the
law, "The banker or his employee must have direct knowledge
of drug trafficking and show commitment to helping it," he
says. "I don't think there exists in the world a banker
stupid enough to make such intentions public."</p>
<p>HIGH-SPEED TRAINS FOR POLAND</p>
<p>The French national railroad has signed a five-year
cooperation accord with Poland to provide advice on how to
develop a high-speed rail network. The accord proposes a
study of how to boost the average speed of Poland's trains to
125 miles an hour. One of France's high-speed trains recently
set the world speed record at 320 miles an hour. In addition
to technology, the accord deals with maintenance practices
and the use of computers.</p>
<p>NEW FRENCH NATIONALIZATION?
</p>
<p>France's ruling Socialists proposed the first
nationalization since they regained power in 1988. The bill
to give the state control of nuclear-power-plant maker
Framatome S.A. appears to mark the end of the Socialists'
self-imposed moratorium on nationalizations and
privatizations, and could herald more restructuring of French
industry. The move also punctuates a long-running dispute
between the Finance Ministry and Cie. Generale d'Electricite,
France's big telephone and electrical equipment maker, which
in June boosted its Framatome stake to a majority 52%, from
its previous 40%. The government controls 45% and 3% belongs
to employees.</p>
<p>FRENCH CENSUS</p>
<p>A new census shows France having a population of
58,452,500, including 1,896,500 in its overseas possessions.
That's a net increase of more than two million from the
previous census eight years ago. The population of
metropolitan France -- excluding overseas regions -- is
56,556,000, compared with 54,335,000 in 1982. The two largest
cities are Paris with 2,147,000 residents and Marseille with
803,000. Paris lost about 30,000 residents since 1982 and
Marseille about 70,000.</p>
<p>TOYOTA TALKS TO BRAZIL</p>
<p>Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. is considering a $2 billion
investment to build motors and small trucks in Brazil, the
Brazilian government said. The president of Toyota's
Brazilian subsidiary met last week with Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello to discuss the project, a ministry
spokesman said. Toyota is interested in producing 20,000
vehicles and 100,000 motors a year in Brazil, the spokesman
said. Toyota currently makes 6,000 jeeps a year at a plant
near Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>HELP FOR PORTUGAL'S TAXPAYERS</p>
<p>Portugal will pay 14% interest on reimbursements for tax
overpayments. A new decree says "the state must not demand
from its citizens . . . more stringent behavior than it
imposes on itself." Portugal has in the past demanded
interest on late tax payments, but reimbursed overpayments
without interest. "That is an unjust situation," read the
decree.</p>
<p>GESTURE FROM SOUTH KOREA</p>
<p>South Korea will open its borders to goods and transport
from North Korea to help advance reunification of the two
countries, President Roh Tae Woo said.</p>
<p>"The administration will unrestrictedly allow the inflow
from and through the North of aircraft, ships and other means
of transport, as well as goods," he said. He also said his
government would set up an economic-cooperation fund to help
finance trade with North Korea, the Soviet Union and
socialist nations in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>South Korea has allowed imports of North Korean goods
since Mr. Roh announced a policy shift in July 1988,
promising assistance to Pyongyang in improving relations with
the U.S., Japan and Seoul's other allies. However, only
selected goods are allowed in and must be shipped through
third countries.</p>
<p>In his speech, Mr. Roh promised more democratic reforms
and urged South Koreans to pay more attention to unification
with North Korea.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The Netherlands will soon require visas from citizens of
Peru, Colombia and Bolivia in a drive to curb drug smuggling
from South America, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. . .
. In New Zealand, Penny Jamieson became Anglican bishop of
Dunedin, the country's southernmost diocese, and thus became
the world's first woman to be an Anglican diocesan bishop.
Whakahuihui Vercoe, Anglican bishop of Aotearoa and a Maori,
didn't attend the ceremony; he said New Zealand's native
Maori people were not culturally ready for a woman bishop.</p>
