	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Kimberly-Clark Corp. and New York Times Co. said
they reached an agreement in principle to sell their jointly
owned Canadian newsprint manufacturer to privately held
Kruger Inc., a Montreal-based pulp and paper mill operator.
   Neither company would disclose the sale price for Spruce
Falls Power & Paper Co., but Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark said
the sale of its 50.5% stake will result in an after-tax
charge of about $44 million, or 55 cents a share, in the
second quarter. New York Times said it doesn't expect to take
a charge because it established a $27 million reserve in last
year's fourth quarter to cover possible losses on the sale of
its forest products group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Losses from North American newsprint operations had been
hurting both U.S. companies. Kimberly-Clark blamed losses
from its North American paper interests for declines in
revenue and income for its paper-products lines last year.
And the reserve taken by New York Times last year was
intended to cover expected losses in newsprint operations
beyond Spruce Falls, a spokeswoman said. New York Times has
minority interests in two other newsprint mills in Canada and
in a paper mill in Maine.</p>
<p>The companies had held their joint interest in the paper
company, based in Kapuskasing, Ontario, since 1926.</p>
<p>George Adler, a stock analyst who follows Kimberly-Clark
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said the sale of the
Canadian mill will have "a positive impact on the bottom
line," regardless of the expected second-quarter charge.</p>
<p>In composite trading Friday, Kimberly-Clark closed at
$71.625, up 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange and New
York Times closed at $24.125, up 25 cents on the American
Stock Exchange.</p>
