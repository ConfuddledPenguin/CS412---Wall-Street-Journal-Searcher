	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Compaq Computer Corp. is setting up a network of
personal-computer dealers in East Germany and Yugoslavia, in
a campaign to establish operations in Eastern Europe.
   In an interview, Eckhard Pfeiffer, head of the
Houston-based personal-computer maker's international
division, said the company has appointed 13 private
computer-dealers in East Germany and four in Yugoslavia to
sell Compaq personal computers there. He added that he
expects to expand the East German dealer-network to 30
outlets by year-end and also plans soon to select dealers in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The expansion adds Compaq, the world's second-biggest
maker of personal computers, to the growing list of Western
computer companies establishing sales networks in Eastern
Europe. International Business Machines Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and West Germany's Siemens AG are also
expanding their dealer networks in the region. Spurring the
computer companies is a decision last month by Western
nations to liberalize technology trade with former East Bloc
nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Pfeiffer said he can't predict Compaq sales in the
region because of the shortage of hard currency in most of
the countries. East Germany, he said, offers the best
immediate sales prospects because of the country's currency
union yesterday with West Germany.</p>
<p>He added that Compaq is naming Yugoslav-born Zelimir Ilic,
its 45-year-old manager for the Middle East, Africa and some
West European countries, as sales and marketing director in
Eastern Europe.</p>
