	<p class="article-leader">General Signal Corp. said it decided not to sell its
telecommunications equipment group, saying offers for the
business had been inadequate.
   The Stamford, Conn., maker of semiconductors and
electrical equipment said the group's results exceeded
expectations for the first five months of 1990, and that it
expects sales of approximately $150 million for the full
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General Signal had announced in March its intent to sell
the group, consisting of three units that supply
telecommunications test equipment, transmission and network
products. Instead, a spokesman said, "earnings are worth more
to us than the proceeds we would receive to pay down debt."
General Signal said at the time it intended to use proceeds
of the telecommunications sale to pay down debt.</p>
<p>In a separate announcement, General Signal said it will
shed two unprofitable units in its technology group, namely
semiconductor systems and thin film processing.</p>
<p>General Signal reported earnings for 1989 of $78.5
million, on sales of $1.92 billion.</p>
