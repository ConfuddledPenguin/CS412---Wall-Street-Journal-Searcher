	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo shares finished mixed Friday, with prices declining
toward the end of the day as gains narrowed on high-priced
shares that lent the market early strength.
   London shares finished a choppy session firmer as the
successful completion of the June Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 stock-index contract was well received by the
market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 165.95 points
at 31940.24. The index lost 206.56 points Thursday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index was
down 102.74 points to 31837.50.</p>
<p>On Friday, advancing issues outpaced declining ones,
524-423, with 183 unchanged, as investors showed renewed
interest in buying stocks with strong earnings predictions,
traders said. Dealings centered on small-capitalization
companies that presented favorable outlooks in recently
released consolidated earnings reports.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million
shares, up from 448 million shares Thursday. The Tokyo Stock
Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which
lost 12.00 points Thursday, was down 7.04 points, or 0.30%,
at 2343.36.</p>
<p>The Second Section Index, which gained 22.85 points
Thursday, was up 22.19, or 0.53%, to close at 4200.81. Volume
in the Second Section was estimated at 27 million shares, up
from 25 million shares Thursday.</p>
<p>The yen's early strength prompted buying of shares in
domestic demand-related sectors. Also helped by continuing
advances of high-priced high-technology shares, the Nikkei
index rose as high as 32342 at midmorning. But uncertainty
about the direction of domestic interest rates caused most
domestic demand-related shares to fall back in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Traders said institutional investors mostly remained on
the sidelines or took profits ahead of the weekend, with the
monetary union of West and East Germany slated for Sunday.
But many others predicted that the unification move in Europe
would have little immediate impact on financial markets.</p>
<p>Stocks that could benefit from increased public spending
in Japan were popular, as the Japanese government promised
Thursday at the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediment Initiative
talks a 430 trillion yen ($2.808 trillion) package of public
works spending in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Construction companies and related issues attracted buying
interest, traders said, while technology shares continued to
draw dealer-led buying, as major Japanese brokerage houses
have been setting them up as their trade focus for July.
Buying by investment trust funds also helped support these
shares, traders said.</p>
<p>Fluctuating widely Friday was Sony. As a report that the
company's U.S. unit may be under congressional review for
alleged tax evasion hit the market, Sony dropped as low as
8,860 yen ($57.85) a share in midmorning. Company spokesmen
in the U.S. and in Japan categorically denied the
allegations. The stock eventually ended at 9,080, up 110.</p>
<p>Among other high-tech shares, TDK advanced 50 to 7,500,
Pioneer gained 60 to 6,480, and Kyocera was up 140 at 8,890.</p>
<p>In London, dealers said there was some trepidation early
in the day that the expiration of the June FT-SE 100 contract
would bring a wave of volatility to the market, but this
didn't prove to be the case.</p>
<p>The bulk of the day's trading did come early, but activity
overall was moderate. At the close, the FT-SE 100-share index
was up 18.9 points at 2374.6, having reached a peak of 2384.8
a few minutes after the June contract expired. Its low point
also came in early trading, when the index was down 6.8 at
2348.9.</p>
<p>The narrower Financial Times 30-share industrial index
rose 12.1 to 1899.9. Volume was 461.9 million shares,
compared with 448.1 million the day before.</p>
<p>Among the few corporate features in the day's trading,
Legal & General rose 13 pence to 440 pence ($7.70) a share on
renewed rumors of a bid for the company coming from the
Netherlands. The speculation helped the rest of the insurance
sector, where Prudential gained 8 to 239 and General Accident
rose 16 to #11.41.</p>
<p>Scottish & Newcastle fell 3 to 340. The Edinburgh-based
brewer is due to report full-year earnings today. GEC, which
is due to release full-year earnings Wednesday, dropped 1 to
195.</p>
<p>British Aerospace fell 11 to 534 on fears of a decline in
orders and a pessimistic outlook for defense concerns after
the U.K. government announced a total of #600 million ($1.04
billion) in cuts in its defense budget.</p>
<p>Rothmans International continued to benefit from its
well-received results released Wednesday, rising 28 to 790.
However, the stock was relatively thinly traded with 884,000
shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Among blue-chip stocks, Allied-Lyons rose 5 to 503, B.A.T
Industries climbed 7 to 657, Reuters strengthened 19 to
#12.60, Pearson fell 4 to 765, and Hanson fell 1 to 238.5.</p>
<p>Frankfurt share prices dropped in nervous trading, as
position-squaring at the end of the quarter and before the
start of monetary union with East Germany weighed against
prices. The German Stock Index, or DAX, fell 15.27 points to
end at 1879.90.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of profit-taking before the monetary
union," said Jens Wiecking, a trader at Merck, Finck & Co. in
Duesseldorf. "The market's been volatile lately, and many
people figured before monetary union Sunday . . . was a good
time to take profits."</p>
<p>In other European markets, share prices closed higher in
Brussels, Zurich, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid, lower in Paris
and mixed in Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
higher.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Seoul, Manila and
Singapore, were mixed in Wellington and rose in Hong Kong,
Taipei and Sydney.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
