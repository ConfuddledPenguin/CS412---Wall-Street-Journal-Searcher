	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp. said it will introduce an
"electronic book" system that uses a palm-sized player for
reading books recorded on three-inch compact disks.
   Sony said its "Data Discman" player has a screen that
displays text recorded on CDs, called Electronic Books, that
can store about 100,000 pages of text each, or more than 300
paperback books.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The purpose of this product is to create an entirely new
market. Instead of having to go to a library or bookshelf for
information, people can have access to it anytime and
anywhere," said Sunobu Horigome, head of Sony's General Audio
Group.</p>
<p>He said Sony hopes the product will create a "new culture"
and approach to information access, with an impact similar to
its Walkman portable stereos.</p>
<p>Sony said it plans to begin marketing the machine in Japan
in July for about $380. Overseas sales are expected to begin
in less than a year, after arrangements with local publishers
are made, officials said.</p>
