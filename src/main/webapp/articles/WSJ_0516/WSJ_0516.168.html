	<p class="article-leader">Donald Trump's casinos, traditionally among the real
estate mogul's biggest winners, lost a combined $12 million
during the first quarter of 1990. In the year-earlier quarter
the casinos had a gain of $2.2 million.
   The unaudited figures, released yesterday by the Casino
Association of New Jersey, indicate that Mr. Trump's
properties may have started suffering from a slow Atlantic
City, N.J.-market even before his $1 billion Taj Mahal opened
in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Citywide, the industry lost $4.3 million on gross revenue
of $729.9 million compared with a first-quarter loss of $3.8
million last year on revenue of $730.4 million.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza lost $3.7 million and Trump's Castle lost $8.3
million.</p>
<p>The first quarter results are significant because they
reveal for the first time what effect Mr. Trump's intense
marketing strategies, which raised revenue for the Trump's
Castle, have had on the bottom line.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Trump Plaza results, while poor, were
distorted by a loss of $6 million to a single baccarat player
in January.</p>
