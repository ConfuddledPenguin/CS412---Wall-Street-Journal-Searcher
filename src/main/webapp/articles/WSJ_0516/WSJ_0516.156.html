	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Management Co. Entertainment Group Inc.
said it agreed in principle with Kidder, Peabody Group Inc.
for the General Electric Co. unit to restructure its $72.5
million bridge loan in exchange for as much as a 28% stake in
MCEG, a financially troubled motion-picture producer and
distributor.
   MCEG said Kidder agreed to replace the loan MCEG used to
acquire Virgin Vision Ltd. last August with $55 million of
two-year notes and $17.5 million of five-year notes. The loan
was initially due May 29.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In return, MCEG will issue warrants or convertible bonds
to Kidder, allowing the New York investment banking firm to
buy 12 million of its common shares for $3 each. MCEG said
Kidder will receive warrants to purchase an additional eight
million shares at $3 each if the company hasn't repaid the
five-year notes by Dec. 31.</p>
<p>The arrangement could give Kidder a stake of as much as
28% in the company, MCEG said, assuming it had 64 million
shares outstanding at year end on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>The financing arrangement is subject to a number of
significant conditions, including approval by MCEG's board.</p>
<p>MCEG shares were quoted at $2.8125, bid, in
over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
