	<p class="article-leader">I take great exception to the mention in your April 24
editorial "A Trade Deficit Primer" that "the Semiconductor
Industry Association, {is} in effect a lobby for only two
companies. . . ."
   At present, we represent 35 U.S.-based manufacturers of
semiconductors, including small and large, merchant and
captive companies. Additionally, SIA has 27 associate members
that are either foreign-owned semiconductor makers or firms
that support the industry (i.e. equipment and materials
producers, law firms, etc.). The SIA board of directors is
made up of CEOs, sector presidents and vice presidents of 14
different U.S. semiconductor makers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SIA prides itself on having the ability to build
consensus among our members or to reach compromise when
necessary. We evaluate and appreciate input from all of our
members, whether it be one of the board-member companies or
an associate member. We have up to 60 recommendations and
opinions to consider, not two.</p>
