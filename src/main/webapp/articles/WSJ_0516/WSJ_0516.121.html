	<p class="article-leader">Unconsolidated pretax profit at Citizen Watch Co. declined
3.5% in the year ended March 31 to 15.14 billion yen ($99.3
million) from 15.69 billion yen a year earlier because of
weak sales of wristwatches.
   Net income was 7.82 billion yen, up 30% from 6 billion yen
a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net sales increased 6.9% to 195.25 billion yen from 182.70
billion yen.</p>
<p>However, net sales of wristwatches, Citizen's main
business, sagged because of slower demand, the company said.
Citizen reported 105.85 billion yen in net sales of
wristwatches and parts, down 2.9% from 109.05 billion yen a
year earlier. Sales of wristwatches made up 54% of the
company's business in the year.</p>
<p>Sales were stronger in other areas, including industrial
machinery and equipment, and office equipment.</p>
