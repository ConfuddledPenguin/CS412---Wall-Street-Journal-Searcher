	<p class="article-leader">You erred grievously in your April 11 editorial "Grievous
Misconduct" by saying that King Baudouin of Belgium
"abdicated for two days, allowing the {abortion} bill to
become law." Belgian journalist Paul Belien, who broke the
news blackout of the king's total opposition to abortion,
wrote in your European edition (reprinted in the U.S. edition
April 10, editorial page): "The politicians just ignored the
constitution. Mr. {Prime Minister Wilfried} Martens simply
suspended the king's powers for two days and had the
government sign the abortion law instead." Mr. Belien, who
was fired by the Gazet van Antwerpen for his Journal article,
deserved firm and accurate support. If not from his
publisher, where?
