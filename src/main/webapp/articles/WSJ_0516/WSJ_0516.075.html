	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Memotec Data Inc., a telecommunications,
computer systems and communications products concern, expects
1990 net income will be "about flat" with the year-earlier
20.1 million Canadian dollars (US$17 million), or 52 Canadian
cents (44 U.S. cents) a share, said Morrie Glick, vice
president, finance.
   Mr. Glick said after the annual meeting that earnings each
quarter are expected to increase from year-earlier levels for
the remainder of this year. Memotec had a first-quarter net
loss, after special charges, of C$4.1 million, or 10 Canadian
cents a share, on revenue of C$89.5 million.</p>
