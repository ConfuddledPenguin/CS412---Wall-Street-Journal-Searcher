	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Warnaco Inc. said a management group bought
out 95% of the apparel company's Activewear division, which
includes the Speedo swimwear line, for $85 million plus
assumption of about $5 million of debt.
   The move marks the first major asset sale for Warnaco,
which was taken private in a leveraged buy-out in 1986, said
Linda J. Wachner, the parent's president and chief executive
officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $18 million gain on the sale ensures that for 1990,
Warnaco will post its first full-year profit, Ms. Wachner
said, adding that the parent also expects to operate
profitably for the rest of 1990.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old Ms. Wachner also becomes chairman and
chief executive officer of the new company, which is expected
to be named Speedo/Activewear Inc. and based in Van Nuys,
Calif.</p>
<p>Also taking an equity stake as part of the investor group
is a subsidiary of Pentland Group PLC of London. Warnaco will
retain 5% of the new company.</p>
<p>The Activewear unit accounted for $85 million, or 13%, of
Warnaco's $650 million of sales in 1989.</p>
<p>For 1989, the company posted a $20 million loss,
reflecting $13 million of noncash write-offs of certain
apparel lines and amortization of $20 million of intangible
assets.</p>
<p>The company is current on interest payments and in
November will begin paying down about $390 million in
subordinated debt from the original leveraged buy-out, Ms.
Wachner said.</p>
<p>In 1989, Warnaco reduced bank debt to $94 million from
$133 million; bank debt now sits at about $50 million, Ms.
Wachner said.</p>
