	<p class="article-leader">After the Soviet Red Army moved in to stop fighting
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in January, the Kremlin's
pretext, widely credited in the West, was that it moved only
to suppress bloody ethnic animosity. Later it became clear
that Soviet troops moved in only after the ethnic riots had
been allowed to run their course, and that in all likelihood
the ethnic tensions had been deliberately stirred by at least
some elements among Soviet authorities. These points were
made forcefully by, among others, world chess champion Gary
Kasparov, who rescued his Armenian relatives from Azerbaijan.
   Yesterday, in both Latvia and Estonia, which had recently
declared their independence from the Soviet Union, there were
clashes between Russians and non-Russians in front of the
countries' respective parliament buildings. In a recent
interview in New York with the editors of The Wall Street
Journal, a leader of the Estonian independence movement drew
our attention to the Russian nationalist group called
Interfront, which has appeared in a number of Soviet
republics. On Monday, a helicopter over the Latvian capital
of Riga dropped leaflets, signed by Interfront. Here is the
full text of the document:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Let us rise up in defense of Soviet power in Latvia. The
time for orators has passed. It is time to go over from words
to deeds.</p>
<p>"Our fate is being decided today. The honor and
self-respect of the Soviet person does not give us the right
to hide behind the backs of those who are fighting for our
future. Let disdain and shame cover the descendants of those
who in this decisive hour do not come out against
counter-revolution. Men -- look into the eyes of your
children, mothers and wives. Can you leave them defenseless?</p>
<p>"At 10 o'clock, May 15, 1990, stop the factories and
plants and come out into the streets of the city. Altogether
we will go to the buildings of the Supreme Soviet with the
demand for the re-establishment of Soviet power in the
republic. Let the handful of traitors and political
adventurers who are making decisions for us hear the voice of
the working people.</p>
<p>"Long live the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Even before these events, Baltic leaders had come to
suspect that the similarity and professionalism of Interfront
activities suggest that it is pretty much run by Soviet
intelligence. This time, the people of the West should at
least allow the possibility that the Baltic "unrest" isn't
spontaneous but is instead the strategy Moscow is using to
lay the justification for armed suppression of the empire's
spreading independence movements.</p>
<p>We don't deny the possibility that there could be tensions
in the Baltic republics between some Russians and
non-Russians. However, with Secretary of State Baker even now
in Moscow preparing for the impending Bush-Gorbachev summit,
we do not see why the West's leaders and editorialists should
continue to accord Mr. Gorbachev deference in his offensives
against these democratic independence movements.</p>
<p>In their May 4 declaration of independence, the Latvians
bent over backward to accommodate Mr. Gorbachev's insistence
on a go-slow process, without confrontation. In return, the
Soviet leader Monday night declared Latvia's and Estonia's
March 30 independence declarations "null and void." Now we
have the spectacle of several thousand off-duty Soviet
soldiers pushing people around in front of the Latvian
parliament, and reports of 2,000 Russians storming the
Estonian legislature in Riga. They were turned back by about
15,000 Estonians. We hope that in the days ahead some thought
is given to the possibility that these "tensions" are not
some agentless event but are instead occurring by design.</p>
<p>It is now clear that Mr. Gorbachev's earlier economic
sanctions against Lithuania have only encouraged the efforts
of the three Baltic states to gain independence from Moscow.
Over the weekend, they aligned themselves with each other by
re-establishing the Council of Baltic States, first formed in
1934 when the Baltic nations were independent states.</p>
<p>It seems likely that they will continue seeking alliances
with reform movements elsewhere. Indeed, just a week ago
Sunday in Kiev, "people's-front" groups from eight Soviet
republics met to create the Union of Democratic Forces. Its
purpose, said the Ukrainian group Rukh, is "to help republics
quit the U.S.S.R. . . . and to ensure the empire disbands
peacefully."</p>
<p>The events in Estonia and Latvia yesterday were not
peaceful. It would be unfortunate if the authorities in
Moscow, beset by an economy that is failing, could devise no
better nearterm policy than to destabilize their own
republics and use the army to successively impose an
"Armenian peace" on each of them. Yet this is the path we
seem to be on, with the big remaining question one of timing.
Will the Red Army move in Talinn and Riga before or after Mr.
Gorbachev and Mr. Bush trade toasts and smiles at the White
House?</p>
