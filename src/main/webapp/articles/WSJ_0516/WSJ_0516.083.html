	<p class="article-leader">While strikes by Sandinista unions yesterday paralyzed
Violetta Chamorro's newly elected government, unsettling news
of past Sandinista acts was emerging. The May 5 issue of
Barricada, the Sandinista Party organ, reports that 20,289
Contra rebels were killed during the war. Additionally, they
claim to have captured 3,365 Contras. This far exceeds all
known figures for Contra combatants, so it seems likely that
unarmed opponents of the Sandinistas were also being killed
and counted. These Sandinista figures raise questions about
the work of the human-rights groups chartered to monitor
abuses in that beleaguered country. In their rush to condemn
Contra abuses, these groups apparently missed the real level
of Sandinista killing.</p>
