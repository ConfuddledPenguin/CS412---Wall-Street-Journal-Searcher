	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- An increasing number of companies are
instituting or plan to implement programs to test job
applicants or employees for substance abuse, a survey by the
Conference Board found.
   The one-year survey, results of which were released today,
was based on information collected in 1988. The survey found
that 55% of 681 human resources executives polled have
implemented or were about to implement the testing programs.
About nine out of 10 of the companies engaged in drug testing
have issued formal policies on drug and alcohol use in the
workplace.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The executives polled come from a broad range of
industries, and most frequently cited the need to counter
drug problems in the workplace as the reason for the testing
programs. Among other reasons were improving safety,
providing a deterrent to nonusers, preventing legal liability
in drug-related accidents and reducing costs.</p>
<p>A previous survey reported in 1986 in a trade publication,
Human Resource Management News, found only about 3% of
companies polled were testing job applicants or employees for
drug use before 1984, the current survey report said. The
Conference Board is a nonprofit business research
organization.</p>
<p>The survey found that testing programs are most prevalent
in manufacturing, mining, public utilities and transportation
sectors, and least prevalent among financial services
companies.</p>
