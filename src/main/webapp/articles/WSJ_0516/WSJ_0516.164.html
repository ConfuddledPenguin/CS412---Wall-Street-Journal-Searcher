	<p class="article-leader">Investors in over-the-counter stocks throttled back
yesterday after the record two-day price surge on Friday and
Monday.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.89, a 0.2% gain, to
442.50. Volume remained brisk at 162.3 million shares, down
from 177.2 million. However, declining shares overtook
advancing stocks, 1,019 to 906, as investors began to take
profits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's breathing time," said Jerry Newman, a San
Francisco-based institutional trader with Cowen & Co.
"There's a little backing and filling and profit-taking going
on," he said, adding that the market may ease today on
continued profit-taking.</p>
<p>OTC stocks continued to be supported by investors with
cash they need to commit and by traders covering positions
they sold short in expectations of a market decline, said
Dick Holden, an OTC trader with Alex. Brown & Sons in
Baltimore. He added that the market may slide if today's
monthly consumer price index report doesn't meet
expectations.</p>
<p>MCI Communications continued its advance, gaining 5/8 to
41, and led the Nasdaq utility index, which outpaced other
indexes with a 0.5% gain. Traders said insurance and other
interest-rate sensitive stocks moved higher amid anticipation
that interest rates may decline. The Nasdaq index of 100
large financial stocks gained 0.4%, the insurance index added
0.2% and the index of smaller financial shares rose 0.3%.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems lost 1 1/4 to 29 1/4. As expected, the
Mountain View, Calif., computer manufacturer introduced a
low-cost computer workstation.</p>
<p>Laserscope was the most active, falling 1 to 20 5/8 on 2.1
million shares, which included a block of 780,000 shares, or
12.7% of the company's 6.2 million outstanding shares. Alfred
Merriweather, chief financial officer of the San Jose,
Calif., maker of surgical laser systems, said that Du Pont
sold part of its estimated 18% holding.</p>
<p>Shares of biotechnology issues stepped into the spotlight,
as investors anticipate that treatments for cancer developed
by several companies will be discussed next week at the
annual meeting in Washington of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology.</p>
<p>Prudential Bache biotechnology analyst Stuart Weisbrod
said that Monday afternoon he repeated his "buy" opinions on
the stocks of four companies whose products will be reviewed
at the meeting: Amgen, which gained 1 1/4 to 66 3/4; Cytogen,
which added 1/8 to 7; Immunex, which rose 1/4 to 17 1/2 and
Cetus, which was unchanged at 15 3/8. Genetics Institute,
also scheduled to have data reviewed at the meeting, rose 1
to 35 1/4.</p>
<p>Mr. Weisbrod said in an interview that next Monday an
independent researcher will discuss studies of Amgen's white
blood cell stimulating factor, G-CSF, used in chemotherapy to
reduce bone-marrow toxicity. On Tuesday, researchers are
scheduled to review Interleukin-2, an anti-cancer product
developed by Immunex, and a color-imaging product developed
by Cytogen to detect ovarian and colorectal cancer.
Throughout the week, he said, researchers will discuss a drug
developed by Cetus used in combination with other products to
treat kidney cancer and melanoma.</p>
<p>Nike raced to an all-time high of 75 1/4, up 3 1/2, after
analysts repeated bullish comments about the footwear maker
as the end of its May 31 fiscal year nears, Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said. Yesterday, Shearson Lehman
Hutton analyst Josie Esquivel repeated the brokerage's top
rating on the Beaverton, Ore., company; on Monday, Salomon
Brothers analyst Heidi R. Steinberg repeated her purchase
recommendation.</p>
<p>Nike is due to report fourth-quarter and year-end earnings
July 9 in New York. Ron Parham, Nike's investor relations
manager, said the company isn't discouraging estimates of
annual earnings ranging from $6 to $6.20 a share, up from
$4.45 a share in 1989.</p>
<p>Earnings reports fueled gains in several issues, among
them: Motor Club of America, rose 1 1/8 to 8 1/4; Florida
Employers Insurance gained 1 to 9 3/4; ECI Telecom advanced 1
3/8 to 18 1/2.</p>
<p>Late Monday, Motor Club, a Newark, N.J., provider of
automobile, insurance and financing services, reported net
income for the first quarter ended March 31 of 51 cents a
share, up from 12 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Florida Employers Insurance reported Monday net income for
the first quarter ended March 31 of 36 cents a share, down
from 44 cents a share a year earlier. Based in Grand Cayman,
British West Indies, the provider of reinsurance, claims
management, brokerage and other services to the insurance
industry also boosted its quarterly dividend to seven cents a
share from six cents.</p>
<p>ECI Telecom Ltd. hit a new 52-week high after reporting
Monday net income for the first quarter ended March 31 of 55
cents a share, including a one-time gain of seven cents. A
year earlier, the Israeli maker of telecommunications systems
earned 19 cents a share.</p>
<p>Environment Control Group advanced for the second day
after the Maple Shade, N.J., provider of asbestos abatement
services announced Monday a new financing agreement including
a $23 million line of credit. The stock jumped 1 to 5 1/2.</p>
<p>POP Radio lost 1/4 to 17 1/2 after the New York
broadcasting concern reported late Friday a loss for the
third quarter ended March 31 of $12,000, compared with a
profit of $455,000 in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
