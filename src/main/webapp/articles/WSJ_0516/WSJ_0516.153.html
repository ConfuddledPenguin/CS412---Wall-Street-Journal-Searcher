	<p class="article-leader">MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- The management consultant firm United
Research said it has sold a majority interest in itself to
Cap Gemini Sogeti, the Paris-based information technology
service company.
   The transaction is part of a pattern of mergers between
consulting firms and information technology firms, said
industry analysts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is the first time in the world that a major
management consulting firm and a major information technology
firm have joined forces," said David Teiger, United's
chairman. Mr. Teiger declined to disclose terms of the
transaction.</p>
<p>United Research, which specializes in strategy and
operations consulting, had combined domestic and overseas
revenue last year of $80 million, according to David Lord,
managing editor of Consultant News, a Fitzwilliam, N.H.,
newsletter.</p>
<p>Cap Gemini had world-wide revenue of $1.3 billion,
including $213 million in this country.</p>
<p>Mr. Lord said the sale is consistent with similar
marriages of consultants and information technology
companies, including the purchase by Computer Sciences Corp.,
El Segundo, Calif., of the Index Group.</p>
