	<p class="article-leader">OAKVILLE, Ontario -- Ford Motor Co. of Canada said it
expects to report Canadian car and truck sales of 1,390,000
vehicles in the 12 months ending March 31, 1991, down about
6% from calendar 1989.
   Ford Canada said it expects Canadawide car sales of
920,000 in the 12 months and truck sales of 470,000. It said
its target for the period is to have 20% of the car market
and 30% of the truck market. The company attributed the
decline in sales to slowdowns in the Canadian and U.S.
economies and high interest rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kenneth W. Harrigan, president and chief executive officer
of Ford Canada, added that Canada's proposed goods and
services tax, to take effect Jan. 1, would result in
"abnormally lower volumes" in the fourth quarter of this
year, which is why the sales estimate was made for the year
ending March 1991.</p>
<p>"But what we lose in the fourth quarter of this year we
will gain in the first quarter of next year," he said.</p>
<p>The company also said it intends to build a new paint
facility here, pending final approval of funding by the
boards of Ford Canada and Ford Motor Co., which holds 94% of
the Canadian company. The company said the facility would
paint the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz models that are
produced at the Oakville plant.</p>
<p>Ford Canada said such a plant "would represent the largest
amount spent on a single project in our 86-year history." A
company spokesman said the facility would cost approximately
C$500 million (US$424.8 million).</p>
<p>Preliminary work on the plant has begun and the project
would be completed in May 1992, the company said.</p>
<p>The proposed 7% consumption levy is designed to replace
the current 13.5% manufacturers sales tax. Consumers are
expected to put off purchases of manufactured items until the
new year when they can take advantage of the saving.</p>
