	<p class="article-leader">FLEET/NORSTAR FINANCIAL GROUP Inc. sold $150 million of
9.95% notes at par. The notes will mature on May 15, 1993.
The Providence, R.I.-based financial-services company said it
will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The
issue was co-managed by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and
Salomon Brothers Inc. The notes were issued as a portion of a
$1 billion shelf registration made with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in 1988. Following the current offering,
about $234 million of debt securities will remain in
registration, Fleet said.</p>
