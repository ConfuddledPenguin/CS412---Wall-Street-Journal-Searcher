	<p class="article-leader">Hughes Aircraft Co. said that certain operations of its
missile-systems group were temporarily barred from receiving
new Air Force contracts after the company's recent admission
that it improperly obtained Pentagon documents during the
mid-1980s.
   In March, Los Angeles-based Hughes agreed to pay $3.6
million in criminal and civil penalties as part of a plea
agreement in which it admitted using a pair of classified
five-year Pentagon budget plans in 1984.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., said it received a
letter about the proposed debarment last week. "Once you
receive the notice, you are placed on suspension while you
meet with the Air Force to go over what changes you have made
to rectify the situation," said a company spokesman.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has the authority to bar Hughes from
receiving any new federal contracts for up to three years.
"We're under review now; it's up to the Air Force to decide"
how long the suspension continues, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>An Air Force spokesman said in Washington that the
suspension covers engineering, research and certain other
operations at the Canoga Park, Calif., facility of the
company's missile-making group. Since those operations don't
directly hold or compete for military contracts, he said the
suspension isn't expected to have any impact on the company's
current operations.</p>
<p>But if the Air Force eventually imposes the more stringent
punishment it has proposed, the impact on Hughes could be
significant. Engineers, scientists and others at the facility
could be barred from working on some or all of Hughes' future
military work. The company has until early June to make its
case to a special Air Force board.</p>
<p>There's a good chance, however, that Hughes will escape
long-term pain. In the past, Pentagon officials have been
unwilling to bar major contractors from new contracts.
Moreover, none of the other firms convicted in the
document-swapping case have been hit with long-term
sanctions.</p>
<p>As part of the company's plea agreement last month,
prosecutors said that the company cooperated with the
investigation and that General Motors, which acquired Hughes
in 1985, didn't participate in or benefit from the illegal
activity. Such language typically has protected contractors
from Pentagon punishment.</p>
