	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian government raised the interest rate
on all Canada Savings Bonds to 11.5% a year from 10.5%.
   The new rate will be in effect for the five months
beginning June 1 and ending Oct. 31. Canada Savings Bonds can
be redeemed at any time at face value. They can be purchased
only by Canadian residents and are one of the government's
main instruments for raising money.</p>

in recent months to take advantage of competing instruments
with higher interest rates.</p>
