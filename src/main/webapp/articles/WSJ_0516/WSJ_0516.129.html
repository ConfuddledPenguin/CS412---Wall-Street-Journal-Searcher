	<p class="article-leader">Dillard Department Stores Inc., Limited Inc. and J.C.
Penney Co. posted double-digit earnings gains for the first
quarter, although Penney's increase was largely the result of
a one-time write-down in the year-earlier period.
   Dillard, a department store chain based in Little Rock,
Ark., reported a 50% increase in net income, and Limited, a
specialty apparel retailer based in Columbus, Ohio, reported
a 38% increase in profit for the quarter. Both cited strong
sales as a primary reason behind the increases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Penney, however, said its first-quarter sales were softer
than it had expected, a problem analysts have attributed to
continued disappointing sales of women's apparel. Penney said
net income rose 20.5%, to $154 million, or $1.21 a share,
from $128 million, or 97 cents a share. But the year-earlier
results included a $20 million charge to discontinue an
interactive home television shopping service.</p>
<p>Penney's sales rose just 5.7%, to $3.53 billion from $3.34
billion. Total revenue, which was reclassified to include
finance-charge revenue from the company's credit-card
accounts, increased 6.3%, to $3.8 billion from $3.58 billion.</p>
<p>Dallas-based Penney said its department store margins
increased in the quarter, but its overall gross margin fell
to 35.6% from 36% last year because of an unusually high
level of markdowns in its catalog business.</p>
<p>Daniel Barry, a senior vice president at Kidder, Peabody &
Co., said the company's catalog profits have been hurt for
much of the last year by a lack of fashionable clothing
offerings. But he said the company is expected to improve its
selection in its June book, and catalog margins are expected
to improve later this year. The company also is trying to
improve its women's apparel sales in its department stores by
upgrading fashions and bringing in more brand names.</p>
<p>Still, the market didn't like Penney's results, and its
stock fell $1.375 to close at $65.25. Dillard, which released
its results after the market closed, was up $3.50 to close at
$86.75, and Limited closed at $45.625, unchanged. All three
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Dillard's stock is up more than $15 since May 1 on
expectations of stronger-than-projected earnings.</p>
<p>Limited, citing a "solid customer response," said its net
income rose to $62.3 million, or 34 cents a share, from $45.2
million, or 25 cents a share.</p>
<p>The retailer attributed the increases to good performances
by Lane Bryant, Express and Victoria's Secret stores and
catalogs.</p>
<p>Sales for Limited rose 15% to $1.11 billion from $964.6
million. Leslie H. Wexner, chairman and chief executive
officer, said the company will increase store selling space
by 2.8 million square feet in 1990, or 19%, from the 14.4
million square feet the company had at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Dillard said its net increased to $29.4 million, or 82
cents a share, from $19.6 million, or 61 cents a share.
Analysts had been expecting results of about 72 cents a
share. The company had 35.9 million shares outstanding this
year, up from 32.3 million last year. Sales rose 24.1% to
$742.4 million from $598.1 million.</p>
