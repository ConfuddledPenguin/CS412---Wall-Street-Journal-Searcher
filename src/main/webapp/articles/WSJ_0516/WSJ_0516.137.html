	<p class="article-leader">Bass PLC, a major British brewing company, said it
completed the sale of its Crest Hotel chain to Trusthouse
Forte PLC, a U.K. hotels group.
   Bass said Trusthouse Forte will pay #300 million ($504.5
million) in cash, lifting the total proceeds from Bass's
hotel sales thus far this year to #400 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bass said the sale is the "most significant step" so far
in its continuing program of disposing hotel properties that
no longer fit into its long-term strategy of focusing on the
development of its Holiday Inn brand world-wide.</p>
<p>Last August, Bass bought the Holiday Inn hoteliers in the
U.S. for $1.98 billion. It has also held a number of Holiday
Inn franchises in the U.S. since acquiring Holiday Corp.'s
operations outside North America in 1988.</p>
<p>The transaction with Trusthouse Forte will involve the
sale of 43 hotels, while Bass will retain four hotels in the
U.K. and four in continental Europe.</p>
<p>Trusthouse Forte's chief executive, Rocco Forte, said the
deal was an "excellent purchase," which is expected to make a
positive contribution to profits in the current financial
year. "The Crest Hotels we are buying are in very good
condition and are well managed," he added.</p>
