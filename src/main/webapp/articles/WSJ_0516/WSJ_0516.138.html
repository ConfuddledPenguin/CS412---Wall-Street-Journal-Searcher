	<p class="article-leader">Bombardier Inc. said Lufthansa German Airlines' DLT
Deutsche Luftverkehrs G.m.b.H. unit placed the first firm
order for the Montreal-based transportation equipment and
aerospace concern's 50-seat Regional Jet.
   DLT, a West German regional airline, ordered 13 RJs,
valued at about US$250 million, including spare parts and
training, and took options for 12 additional RJs, subject to
Lufthansa board approval. The passenger plane is a stretched
version of the Challenger jet developed and made by
Bombardier's Canadair unit. RJ deliveries are to begin in
1992. The DLT purchase contract brings to 139 Bombardier's
orders and options commitments for the RJ. Since the RJ
program was begun in November 1988, eight other airlines have
signed order commitments and taken options.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts expect the market for small commercial jets such
as the RJ to explode in the next few years. Airlines are
expected to increase so-called long thin routes bypassing hub
airports as they reach maximum capacity; the RJ is the first
jet designed for such routes.</p>
