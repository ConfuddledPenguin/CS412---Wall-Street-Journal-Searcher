	<p class="article-leader">Are the oily droplets and white flaky "fallout" from an
Ashland Oil Inc. refinery a nuisance that impairs the quality
of life?
   That's what nearly 300 residents of West Virginia and
Kentucky claim in a suit against Ashland scheduled for trial
today before Judge Tod J. Kaufman of the Charleston, W. Va.,
circuit court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The litigation is among a half dozen suits against Ashland
over pollution from the Catlettsburg refinery in Kentucky, on
the Big Sandy River that borders three states. In its 1989
annual report, Ashland said plaintiffs were seeking about
$850 million in damages.</p>
<p>In this case, the residents are seeking $300 million in
compensatory damages and $300 million in punitive damages for
Ashland's alleged interference with their right under
Kentucky law to enjoy their property free from "annoyance."
They also seek $30 million for medical monitoring, claiming
that pollutants from the refinery have increased their risk
of disease. The case is being divided into two parts; the
part that goes to trial today will involve only the nuisance
allegation.</p>
<p>The Ashland, Ky., company failed in repeated attempts to
get the suit dismissed or have it heard in federal court. An
Ashland spokesman said, "We believe the suit is without merit
and that we have the evidence to prove that." Both sides
declined to say whether they had engaged in settlement
discussions.</p>
<p>Debra Hamilton, a plaintiffs' attorney from the Charleston
firm Di Trapano & Jackson, says her side plans to introduce
evidence showing that refinery pollution has altered
residents' lifestyles.</p>
<p>A key piece of evidence, she says, is a letter John R.
Hall, Ashland's chairman and chief executive officer, sent in
February 1988 to people living near the refinery. In the
letter, Mr. Hall said, "Particles which are large or heavy
enough to fall out of the atmosphere could possibly be
considered a nuisance and could cause some skin irritation
under certain conditions. However, they are not considered a
long-term health risk."</p>
<p>Ms. Hamilton said, "the letter is tantamount to an
admission that the fallout is a nuisance." She says her side
plans to use Mr. Hall as a witness against Ashland.</p>
<p>Ms. Hamilton said plaintiffs will testify that fallout has
forced them to keep children indoors and otherwise alter
their lifestyles. Photographs and testimony will be presented
showing that when residents leave their windows open the dust
invades bedrooms and falls into their mouths. She said people
will testify that the pollution has disrupted outdoor
activities, including Easter picnics.</p>
<p>Ashland's refinery has operated since 1924. But the suit
alleges that air-pollution emissions increased substantially
beginning about 1983, with Ashland assuring the public that
the pollutants were "innocuous and harmless."</p>

<p>PENNSYLVANIA SUES top seven insurers to force compliance
with law.</p>
<p>Regulators have gone on the offensive in state court,
seeking to force some of the largest auto insurers working in
Pennsylvania to lower their premium rates as mandated by a
new law. The suit also charges that the seven companies
worked together to stymie implementation of the law.</p>
<p>The law, adopted in February, required rate reductions of
10% for all drivers and as much as 22% for those who waived
their right to sue except in severe accidents. The lower rate
filings were due May 1.</p>
<p>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., Allstate
Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., Erie Insurance
Exchange, three units of Aetna Life & Casualty Co., and
Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. were named in the suit,
filed in Commonwealth Court in Harrisburg. These companies
have 46% of the auto market in the state.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania's Assigned Risk Plan, which is supposed to
provide insurance for drivers rejected by commercial
companies, was also named as a defendant. The insurers filed
for rate increases, not decreases, with the insurance
department. Representatives from the companies, except
Harleysville, sit on the governing committee of the
assigned-risk plan.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that these companies met four times to
discuss the new insurance law and consider "appropriate
action." State officials claim these insurers raised the same
or similar issues in numerous suits as a way of undermining
the implementation of the law and inundating the insurance
department with paperwork.</p>

<p>ARMCO LOSES $48.8 million jury verdict in Texas.</p>
<p>A federal jury in Houston assessed the damages after
finding that Armco Inc., a Parsippany, N.J., steel company,
breached an agreement to lease space in a new office
building, causing the lender to foreclose on the project.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs included AWH-I Ltd., a limited partnership
formed to construct the building; Bank One Texas, which last
year acquired the lender, MBank Houston, after it failed and
was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; and
the FDIC, which acts as receiver for certain claims pending
against MBank.</p>
<p>Underlying the dispute was a 1984 pact under which Armco
agreed to lease space for 15 years in a building to be built
by AWH-I. AWH-I got a $23.6 million construction loan from
MBank. But in 1986, the suit alleged, Armco breached the
lease agreement after paying four months' rent, leading AWH-I
to default on its loan and the bank to foreclose.</p>
<p>The jury awarded AWH-I about $18 million in actual damages
and lawyers fees, plus $8 million in punitive damages. Bank
One and the FDIC won $19.8 million in actual damages. The
verdict still is subject to approval by Judge Melinda Harmon.</p>
<p>Marvin D. Nathan, a lawyer in Houston with Nathan Wood &
Sommers, counsel for AWH-I, asserted that Armco's lease
termination was motivated by a desire to get "cheaper rent"
while Houston's real-estate market was declining.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Armco said the company is considering an
appeal.</p>

<p>REHNQUIST DECRIES DELAYS in capital punishment; rejects
proposed remedies.</p>
<p>Chief Justice of the U.S. William Rehnquist criticized
proposals by senators on changing the law on appeals to
federal courts by state death-row prisoners.</p>
<p>Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Law
Institute in Washington, he said there is a "serious
malfunction" in the capital-punishment system, leading to
uncertainty and endless delays. His speech, on habeas corpus,
injected the chief justice unusually deeply into the arena of
legislative debate. The Senate is scheduled to consider crime
legislation, including habeas-corpus proposals, possibly as
soon as next week.</p>
<p>In death-penalty cases, habeas corpus is a process in
which inmates convicted in state court, whose appeals are
denied, file a new civil suit in federal court charging their
constitutional rights were violated by their arrest, trial or
sentence.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Rehnquist said a proposal by Sen. Joseph
Biden (D., Del.) goes too far in allowing inmates on death
row repeated opportunities for appeals that lead to delays in
state executions. The Biden legislation's "highly
questionable goal" would be accomplished "by overturning a
series of Supreme Court cases," he said.</p>
<p>He also criticized a proposal by Sen. Strom Thurmond, (R.,
S.C.), which has the support of the Bush administration, to
cut back sharply on appeals to federal courts by state
prisoners on death row. The Thurmond bill would basically bar
inmates convicted in state court from challenging their death
sentences in federal court, unless they were unable to obtain
a "fair" review in state court.</p>
<p>The chief justice urged Congress to consider what he views
as a middle approach proposed last year by a task force that
he appointed led by retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell. The Powell approach also has been introduced as
legislation in the Senate.</p>
<p>The Powell report has been criticized as too restrictive
by Sen. Biden and civil-liberties groups. The Powell approach
was also criticized by the Judicial Conference, the
policy-making arm of the federal judiciary, which rebuffed
the chief justice in March by endorsing two amendments that
diluted the Powell report.</p>
<p>Congressional aides say there are discussions under way
among Senate factions that may produce a compromise proposal
by next week.</p>
<p>One facet of the Biden proposal, to which the chief
justice objected most strenuously, is to allow inmates in
habeas-corpus cases to take advantage of Supreme Court
rulings decided after their convictions announcing new
constitutional-law principles. This retroactivity, the chief
justice said, "would overturn an entire body of Supreme Court
precedent."</p>

<p>STATE DEPARTMENT legal adviser will join law firm.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesman said Abraham Sofaer would
leave his post as legal adviser June 15 to head the
Washington office of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, a New York law
firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Sofaer has served as the department's in-house counsel
since 1985. Before coming to the State Department, he was a
federal judge in Manhattan, N.Y.</p>
<p>Hughes Hubbard's Washington office has had turmoil in
recent years. In 1988, 11 lawyers left en masse for Arnold &
Porter. More recently Victoria Toensing, a former
high-ranking Justice Department official, decided to leave
the firm.</p>
<p>But Managing Partner Charles Scherer says that Hughes
Hubbard's fortunes have reversed and that under Mr. Sofaer,
who will also serve as co-chairman of the litigation
department, its Washington office will expand to 30 lawyers
from seven.</p>
<p>In addition to litigation, Mr. Sofaer said he plans to
focus on arbitration, and "anything involving the government
or international affairs or international trade."</p>
