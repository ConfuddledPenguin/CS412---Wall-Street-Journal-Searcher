	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bank Polska Kasa Opieki, a Polish bank, filed
an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against Drexel
Burnham Lambert Trade Finance Inc., an attorney for the bank
said.
   Under Chapter 7, a creditor -- such as Bank Polska -- can
force a debtor into bankruptcy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for the parent company, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc., said its attorneys had been notified of the
filing in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan but hadn't
yet seen the petition.</p>
<p>Jon Arnason, an attorney for Bank Polska, said that the
Drexel unit's total assets are $94 million and its total
liabilities are $98 million. He said he expects the case to
be converted from Chapter 7 to Chapter 11 under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, the debtor would continue
to manage the company.</p>
<p>The Drexel spokesman said he also expects the case to be
converted to Chapter 11. The parent company filed under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13.</p>
<p>Bank Polska said it is owed $5 million by Trade Finance
for a short-term loan that was to be repaid around the time
of the parent company's Chapter 11 filing. Mr. Arnason said
the other creditors include the National Bank of Poland,
which is owed $12 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Arnason said the largest creditor is DBL Finance Ltd.,
a Drexel unit that is in receivership in England. He said
that unit is owed $28 million. According to the parent
company's previous filings, it owed DBL Finance $141.3
million on Feb. 12.</p>
<p>The parent company has disclosed that it owed DBL Trade
Finance $28 million on Feb. 12. Mr. Arnason said Drexel
Burnham Lambert Trading Corp., which was pushed into
bankruptcy proceedings last seek, is owed $20.5 million by
DBL Trade Finance.</p>
<p>Mr. Arnason said many of the creditors' transactions with
DBL Trade Finance involved foreign-exchange transactions.</p>
