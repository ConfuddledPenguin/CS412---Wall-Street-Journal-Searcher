	<p class="article-leader">Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has received some bad
press for his management style, most recently over the
resignation of Deputy Attorney General Donald Ayer. The
conventional line on the Ayer flap is that Mr. Thornburgh
didn't support his deputy's instinct to rely on the advice of
the department's "professional" civil servants. If this is
true, we'd say that Mr. Thornburgh deserves credit for
attempting to create a department that speaks with one voice
in an Executive Branch that for years has weakened its
institutional powers by speaking with too many voices.
   The Founding Fathers wanted a unified Executive Branch so
that it could hold up its side in the separation of powers,
posing itself against the countervailing forces in Congress.
The President and his aides are supposed to adopt and stand
accountable for a clear set of policies. Mr. Thornburgh has
consciously pursued this goal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This has angered the career staff, which might not be all
that bad. It had become standard operating procedure in
Washington for career staffers in league with loose-wheel
officials to sabotage policies they don't like or that
threaten the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>One reason Deputy Attorney General Ayer resigned last week
was that he wanted to support a radical proposal by the U.S.
Sentencing Commission, which would have multiplied by up to
50 times the punishments for companies convicted of
regulatory or other white-collar crimes. Shareholders of
firms convicted for environmental or securities violations,
even when the culprit was one low-level employee, could have
had to pay huge new fines out of earnings. It is an entirely
legitimate position that such a policy makes little economic
sense.</p>
<p>Mr. Ayer, however, sent a letter to the Sentencing
Commission in February saying that Justice agreed these new
guidelines were "urgently needed." In fact, many officials at
the White House were horrified at the proposals. White House
Counsel Boyden Gray asked Robert Ross, one of Mr.
Thornburgh's top aides, what was going on. Mr. Ayer soon
thereafter sent another letter to the Sentencing Commission,
retracting the endorsement of the guidelines, which have
since been shelved.</p>
<p>We've noted before that for all his accomplishments,
President Reagan failed to protect the institutional powers
of his office. Terry Eastland, who was the spokesman for
Attorney General Meese's Justice Department, is writing a
book on "Conservatives in Power" that emphasizes the
importance of a unified, energetic Executive Branch. He
argues, for example, that there wouldn't have been so much
bickering in the White House if President Reagan had fired
David Stockman and others who leaked as a way to win internal
policy battles.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh is reassigning some of the aides he brought
to the department from his native Pennsylvania, but signaled
his continued interest in building a unified Executive Branch
by selecting William Barr as his new deputy. Mr. Barr, head
of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, is appropriately enough
an expert on separation of powers. If more departments follow
the Justice model, George Bush could be the first President
in many years to leave the office stronger than he found it.</p>
