	<p class="article-leader">I take serious exception to your efforts to trivialize the
serious misdeeds of the principals in the Iran-Contra
scandal. Your April 9 "After Poindexter" editorial is built
on a mighty thin reed. Blaming Congress and the Democrats for
"criminalizing of policy differences with the executive
branch" begs a much larger issue here: Should members of the
executive branch be allowed to withhold vital information
from those members of Congress charged by law to monitor
specific actions of the president?
   A lifelong Republican, Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh,
didn't think so. An impartial grand jury that voted to indict
Adm. John Poindexter didn't think so, nor did the 12 jurors
who found him guilty on all five charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Your Iran-Contra editorials send the wrong message both to
those who believe they can hide behind so-called patriotic
acts without punishment, and also to those who cynically view
such selective "law-and-order" posturing as further evidence
that there indeed exist two standards of justice in our
country.</p>
