	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. named Dale Comey as executive vice
president and gave him responsibility for the day-to-day
operations of two key units.
   Mr. Comey, 49 years old, has been president and chief
operating officer of ITT Hartford Fire Insurance Co. since
1988. ITT Hartford is ITT's largest operating unit,
generating nearly 21% of the company's total operating profit
last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>People at the company said that with Mr. Comey's
appointment to executive vice president, he has been clearly
identified as a possible successor to DeRoy Thomas, ITT
president and chief operating officer. Mr. Thomas plans to
retire next February. In moving up from the insurance unit to
the corporate staff, Mr. Comey has skipped several rungs on
the ITT corporate ladder.</p>
<p>"Given this slot and the amount of responsibility they
have given him, they could be grooming him for a bigger role
within the company," said Jack Kelly, who follows ITT at
Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>"The appointment of Dale Comey to this senior executive
position is an expression of my confidence . . . that Dale
will play a significant role in the management of our
corporation over the long term," said Rand Araskog, ITT
chairman.</p>
<p>Mr. Comey, who began his business career as an actuarial
trainee at ITT Hartford in 1965, will be responsible for ITT
Rayonier, a forest products operation, and ITT Coins, which
involves a yellow-pages directory outside the U.S. and 38
technical schools in this country.</p>
<p>ITT Rayonier was ITT's second biggest income generator in
1989, contributing 16% of operating net. Like insurance,
forest products is a highly cylical business. ITT Coins is
one of the company's smaller units.</p>
<p>Mr. Comey said his first task is to develop a full
understanding of what opportunities lie ahead for these two
units. Then, his focus will be on developing their
competitive advantages, which is what "yields a
better-than-average return for shareholders," he said.</p>
<p>In his new position, Mr. Comey reports to Mr. Thomas.
Before becoming president of ITT in 1988, Mr. Thomas headed
the Hartford insurance group. Mr. Comey worked as his
executive assistant during the mid-1970s.</p>
