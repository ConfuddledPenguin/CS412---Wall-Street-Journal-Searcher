	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Quixote Corp.'s sale of its compact-disk unit
to an Australian concern has boomeranged, and Quixote says it
couldn't be happier.
   The holding company yesterday announced that it had
reacquired -- for $1,000 -- the remaining 51% of an operation
it sold for $55.5 million two years ago. What's more, the CD
unit, which was losing money when Quixote sold it, is now
profitable, says a spokeswoman. The unit makes laser video
disks, audio compact disks and CDs for use in computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Quixote sold the unit, then called LaserVideo Inc., to
Disctronics Ltd. of Melbourne in January 1988. The Australian
company paid Quixote $29 million cash and issued a note for
$26.5 million, payable in January 1989.</p>
<p>Disctronics didn't make good on the note. Quixote
initially sued, but late last year it entered into a new
agreement under which Quixote received 49% stake in its
former unit, now called Disctronics Manufacturing Inc.</p>
<p>As part of the revised agreement, Disctronics Ltd. also
issued Quixote preferred shares and set up a schedule of
repayments which, if Disctronics didn't meet, allowed Quixote
to buy the remainder of the unit for a "nominal" $1,000.</p>
<p>Disctronics Ltd. didn't meet the first payment, scheduled
for April 30, Quixote says, and so the Chicago company
"regained total ownership."</p>
<p>The unit, renamed yet again Disc Manufacturing Inc., seems
none the worse for its round trip: Quixote said Disc's sales
climbed 70% in the year ended March 31, to $38 million, and
are expected to climb to $55 million in the current 12
months. Operating profit was $3.8 million in the latest year,
and is also expected to increase "at a good clip," Quixote
said, thanks in part to $10 million its former owners spent
to boost capacity.</p>
<p>Disc, which manufactures CDs at plants in Alabama and
California, is also benefiting from trends favorable to
domestic CD manufacturers, Quixote said.</p>
<p>Quixote is a holding company with interests in
highway-safety products, computer-aided transcription
services and diagnostic equipment.</p>
