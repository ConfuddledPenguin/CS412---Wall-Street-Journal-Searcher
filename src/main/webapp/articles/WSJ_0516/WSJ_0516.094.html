	<p class="article-leader">Mikhail Gorbachev, booed and jeered during the May Day
rally in Red Square, surely realizes the desperate nature of
the political paradox he faces. His economic advisers tell
him his reforms cannot succeed without price reform, which
they warn will bring inflation. His political advisers and
his own instincts tell him the federation cannot survive the
pain of this "austerity solution," patterned after Poland's
"big bang."
   In recent discussions in Moscow with the State Bank of the
U.S.S.R., a possible solution occurred to me: The key is a
conscious policy of monetary deflation, leading to a
gold-convertible ruble.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviet economy's myriad problems will take years to
solve, as all economists agree. The current crisis, though,
requires a quick fix. Because Soviets have been told that
price reform will inevitably lead to inflation, they are
doing everything reasonable people can do to get rid of their
rubles before that predicted inflation occurs: They're buying
up everything in sight.</p>
<p>Officials say the average household has up to seven years'
supply of laundry detergent. Last year $1 billion in hard
currency was used to import detergent, and it disappeared as
soon as it hit the shelves. The detergent is poor man's gold;
it is not subject to spoilage or vermin and can be stored
indefinitely -- just like bonds.</p>
<p>More serious is a growing food crisis. A recent reform
permits farmers to sell their surpluses for cash instead of
delivering them to the state at a fixed price. But because
farmers expect prices to soar in the coming inflation, they
are withholding their surpluses from the market. As many as
30 million tons of grain are in storage or are being fed to
animals while the state pays hard currency to import grain.</p>
<p>Consider tomatoes. When they can be found, the fixed price
is three rubles per kilo, compared with 15 rubles on the free
market. The government assumes that if price controls
suddenly were lifted, the market would clear close to 15
rubles. The value of wages in the controlled economy would
plunge and the value of the nearly 500 billion rubles in
personal savings and pensions would drop to a fraction of
present worth. Mr. Gorbachev has rejected this "shock
therapy," as he calls it.</p>
<p>Monetary deflation solves the problem. The Soviet Union
has an advantage over Western nations in being able to deploy
deflation as a policy instrument. Instead of trying to reduce
the supply of rubles, it could increase demand for them by
greatly increasing their value. Once Soviets realize the
government is not going to cheapen the ruble but is going to
strengthen it, they will unload hoarded goods to acquire the
more valuable currency. In economic parlance, inflation is
prevented by a sharp decline in the velocity of money and
rise in the supply of goods.</p>
<p>The deflation should come before price reform. Then, when
wage and price controls are lifted, wages and prices will not
rise and the process of shifting to a market economy from a
command economy will be greatly eased. The price of tomatoes
would fall to three rubles per kilo in the free market and
all prices would equilibrate at the deflated level. The
purchasing power of wages would be restored.</p>
<p>Western governments can't employ monetary deflation
because it crushes private debtors. But there are no private
debtors in the Soviet Union. There are no personal loans, no
mortgages, no fixed-income securities exchanged by
individuals. The only debtor is the government, which could
easily shoulder the entire burden of adjusting to a market
economy. The people would be left with their savings,
pensions and wages restored to original values.</p>
<p>How to deflate? The Kremlin is planning a 70 billion ruble
bond issue (60 billion rubles for state enterprises and 10
billion rubles for private citizens), with a 16-year maturity
and a 5% coupon.</p>
<p>It will be very difficult to persuade anyone to buy 5%
paper on the eve of an anticipated inflation. But what if the
government were to back interest and principal on the bonds
for its citizens with gold at, say, 500 rubles per ounce?
Ordinary citizens say they wouldn't trust the government's
guarantee. (The one-ruble notes in their pockets already
state they are worth almost a gram of gold.) But they say
they would trust the government if the bonds were also sold
to foreigners. And foreigners would buy if the government
deposited a part of its $30 billion gold hoard with a trustee
in New York or Geneva.</p>
<p>If Soviets see that their government not only says it
won't devalue the ruble but will lose a lot of its gold
reserves if it does, the value of all ruble assets would rise
to meet the value of the tradable bonds. The measure would
shake loose hoarded goods. Gold backing would also call a
bond market into existence, giving the government its first
tool of monetary management. And a successful issue of
gold-backed bonds would then be the springboard for full
ruble convertibility.</p>
<p>Taking the first step toward ruble convertibility in this
fashion eliminates a central concern of Soviet officials: the
fear that the government would be quickly stripped of its
gold and foreign-exchange reserves. A successful bond issue
would also ensure that these reserves would not be at risk
for 16 years, when the bonds mature. Moreover, it would
establish the government's credit-worthiness at home and
abroad; the government would soon find it could increase the
supply of rubles, along with a whole range of bills and
bonds.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Governor Wayne Angell advised the state
bank last September that backing the ruble with gold would
produce the lowest interest rates in the world -- 3% or less.
If properly designed, he said, the bonds would be snapped up
in Western financial markets. New York investment bankers
agree.</p>
<p>As for collateral beyond its gold, the country is rich
beyond belief, in its people and resources, and the
government owns everything -- across 11 times zones. All it
needs is this painless path to ruble convertibility and
perestroika will be off the ground and flying.</p>
