	<p class="article-leader">ARUBA -- Divi Hotels N.V. said it didn't plan to make the
interest payment due yesterday on its $60 million of 14 1/2%
senior debentures.
   The company said it had previously announced that it was
entering into a bond exchange process with the holders of its
two issues of debt securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Divi said that if the exchange offers are completed, this
would reduce the company's cash debt service requirement for
three years, allowing the company time to implement its
strategy of selling or recapitalizing its ownership interests
in its hotel and resort properties. The offers will expire
May 24, unless extended, the company said.</p>
