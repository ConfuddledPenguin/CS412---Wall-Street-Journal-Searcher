	<p class="article-leader">Playboy magazine, bracing itself for competition from a
slew of new men's magazines, is expected to announce today
that it selected Chiat/Day/Mojo to handle its ad account.
   Its choice of a new ad agency comes at a crucial time for
the men's magazine. Men have recently become a hot commodity
in the publishing world, and a coterie of upscale magazines
-- both new and repositioned existing ones -- is competing in
an already tight media market. At the same time, Playboy,
hurt badly by the conservative backlash of recent years, saw
its ad pages plummet from a high of about 1,400 in 1981 to
less than half of that in 1987. By last year, the figure
rebounded slightly to 735.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The magazine's goal now is to persuade advertisers to
think of Playboy when they think of Esquire, Rolling Stone or
new entrants like Murdoch Magazines' planned Men's Life and
the revamped Details. So, Chiat/Day will be rolling out a new
trade advertising campaign, and the magazine will boost its
puny ad budget to about $3 million.</p>
<p>"With this recent spate of men's books and the refocus on
the men's field, we think there's a real opportunity for us
to say: You can take all the men's books out there and add
them up and you still don't get the circulation of Playboy,"
says James Spanfeller, associate publisher and senior vice
president of marketing. Playboy's rate base is 3.4 million,
more than that of GQ, Esquire and Rolling Stone combined.</p>
<p>Playboy, a unit of Playboy Enterprises, still will have to
deal with the basic problem advertisers have with the
magazine, though: The fact that since it built its reputation
on girlie pictures, Playboy isn't just another men's
magazine. Even though only 15% to 20% of the magazine's
editorial content is devoted to the skin pictorials,
advertisers just don't consider it in the same breath with
more sedate men's life-style magazines.</p>
<p>What's more, while Playboy says its readers are just as
upscale as readers of other men's books, that certainly isn't
the perception among advertisers, even Playboy executives
admit. The advertisers are more likely to envision tacky gold
chains, open shirts and beer bellies. Even Mr. Spanfeller
concedes that when he joined last year from Newsweek, he
thought the magazine's readers were downscale. There's "a
gap" between perception and reality, he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Spanfeller, though, contends that the time is right
for Playboy to become more acceptable to the mainstream. He
believes the conservative backlash of the 1980s "is on the
wane." He adds, "The mood of the country is changing from
being obsessed with work to becoming more involved in life
styles. That makes sense with Playboy, because we're about
leisure life."</p>
<p>A new ad campaign geared to advertisers will likely stress
Playboy as a leisure magazine, he said. The campaign "will
give advertisers permission to buy," says Steve Cohen, a
Playboy vice president. Other changes are in the works to
back that up. In July, the magazine introduces two new
columns that presumably have very little to do with naked
women, one on media and one on style. Under Mr. Spanfeller,
Playboy has also beefed up its sales staff.</p>
<p>For Chiat/Day, meanwhile, the account is a first, of
sorts: Playboy's creative work will be handled not by
Chiat/Day's big West Coast or New York offices, but by its
young Toronto office. It's a carefully calculated strategy on
Chiat/Day's part to build up the Canadian office by placing
small but high-profile accounts there. Tom McElligott, the
creative star who joined Chiat/Day earlier this year, even
led the Playboy pitch himself, and will oversee the account.</p>
<p>Bob Wolf, chairman and chief executive officer of
Chiat/Day in North America, says the Toronto office's
strategy "is to think about the Midwest of the U.S. as
new-business hunting ground." For relatively small U.S.
clients like Playboy, the arrangement allows them to be "a
big fish in a small pond," instead of getting lost in the
huge New York or West Coast offices, he says.</p>
<p>For a small fish, the Playboy account was hotly contested.
The account had been handled by Keye/Donna/Pearlstein's New
York office, which was shut down. When word got out, Playboy
was deluged by about 40 ad agencies wanting to pitch the
account, and ultimately had discussions with close to a dozen
of them.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>TOY-STORES ACCOUNT: Lionel Leisure, Philadelphia, awarded
the creative portion of the ad account for its Lionel Kiddie
City and Lionel Playworld toy stores to Ketchum Advertising,
Philadelphia. Billings are $6 million to $8 million.</p>
<p>CONSULTING: Morgan, Anderson & Co., a New York-based ad
consultant, said it will offer evaluations of advertisers'
marketing programs in addition to its compensation service.
The firm said it has two new consultants on staff to help
direct the marketing assessment service.</p>
<p>INTERPUBLIC: Interpublic Group of Cos. directors voted to
increase the quarterly dividend to 19 cents a share from 17
cents a share, payable on June 15 to stock of record May 30.
At the annual meeting, Philip H. Geier Jr., chairman and
chief executive officer, said, "It will be a difficult first
half in our domestic operations," but that the international
side, representing over 60% of the company's business, "is
doing reasonably well." After the meeting, he said 1990
earnings would be "in the area of" analysts' expectations,
which range between $2.30 and $2.40 a share, up from $2.10 a
share last year.</p>
<p>FOOTE CONE: Foote, Cone & Belding said Public
Communications, an ad agency in Taiwan, will join the FCB
international network by the end of the year. The
announcement was made by Norman W. Brown, the agency's
chairman and chief executive, at the agency's annual meeting
in Chicago. In addition, the agency named Gregory W. Blaine,
executive vice president, and Laurel Cutler, vice chairman at
FCB/Leber Katz Partners, to the board.</p>
<p>MOOSEHEAD BEER: Guinness Import Co., Stamford, Conn.,
named Mathieu, Goluskin, Donovan & Clarke, a tiny New York
shop, to create ads for its Moosehead beer brand. Billings
are set at $3 million. The account was previously handled by
McCann-Erickson, an Interpublic Group agency. Guinness Import
is a unit of Guinness PLC.</p>
<p>YELLOW PAGES: D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, New York,
named Mary MacDonald chief executive and managing director of
its DMB&B/Yellow Pages ad division. Separately, the division
acquired Donald E. Whiting Inc., a Deerfield, Ill., agency
specializing in yellow pages advertising. Terms weren't
disclosed. Donald Whiting will continue as chairman of the
unit, reporting to Ms. MacDonald.</p>
<p>MAGAZINE: USA Weekend, a national Sunday magazine
supplement published by Gannett Co., awarded its ad account
to Anda, Bokuniewicz & Scotti, a small New York agency.</p>
