	<p class="article-leader">What do Len Width of Seattle and Susanne Heimbuch of
Minneapolis know that a $200,000-a-year Wall Street analyst
doesn't know?
   They're two of the many individual investors who score big
profits uncovering winning stocks long before they are
discovered by investment professionals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Their secret: Focusing on up-and-coming companies close to
home, while avoiding the pitfalls of local boosterism and
small-stock volatility.</p>
<p>"I get a better feel for companies in my own backyard,"
says Mr. Width, a 71-year-old retired lumber dealer, who has
a third of his portfolio in Pacific Northwest stocks. Adds
Ms. Heimbuch, 44, a public relations consultant: "If you want
to know if they are hiring or laying off people, you can drop
by and count the cars in the parking lot."</p>
<p>It's an approach advocated by mutual-fund manager Peter
Lynch in his 1989 book "One Up on Wall Street." Mr. Lynch,
who's retiring at the end of this month as manager of the
Fidelity Magellan Fund, argues that investors should use "the
power of common knowledge" to give themselves a leg up on the
investment pros.</p>
<p>That's how Mr. Width decided to invest in Nordstrom Inc.,
the Seattle-based department store chain. A bridge
enthusiast, he got to know several Nordstrom executives who
were fellow bridge devotees. He says he was impressed by
these individuals and their stories of what was happening at
the company. Having friends at a company isn't enough by
itself to merit purchase of a stock, but talking to his
bridge pals helped fill in missing details of his study of
the company, Mr. Width says.</p>
<p>Mr. Width says he has made a nice profit on the Nordstrom
shares. "If it gets into the low 20s, I'll mortgage my house
to buy some more," he says. The stock rose 25 cents a share
to $29.75 in over-the-counter-market trading yesterday.</p>
<p>Ms. Heimbuch found G&K Services Inc., a Plymouth, Minn.,
company that rents and launders uniforms, in much the same
way. She had seen G&K's trucks speeding around to various
fast-food restaurants in Minneapolis and St. Paul and figured
that providing employees with uniforms they needed on the job
was a growth area. A trip to the library showed that G&K's
sales and earnings were up steadily over the past five years.</p>
<p>So, in April 1986, Ms. Heimbuch bought 100 G&K shares at
$16 each. Today after various splits, she has 337 shares,
valued at just over $4,500 at yesterday's market price of
$13.375 a share.</p>
<p>Betty Taylor, 66, a retired first-grade teacher in
Overland Park, Kan., also cashed in on the local angle of a
national trend. Mrs. Taylor noticed back in 1987 that her
local grocery and other stores were increasingly using bar
codes on packages that could be electronically scanned at
check-out counters to get quick prices.</p>
<p>A little research showed that one major maker of these
bar-code labels was Graphic Technology Inc., a company in
nearby Olathe, Kan. The company had a solid record of
earnings and sales growth for several years. Another area
investor told Mrs. Taylor that Terry Van Der Truck, Graphic's
chairman, had a record of successfully growing other small
companies.</p>
<p>Next, Mrs. Taylor went to a local "Investors' Fair" where
Graphic Technology was one of the companies appearing and
spoke to Mr. Van Der Truck and other executives in person.
She came away convinced that the company had a strong
position in a niche market.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Taylor bought the stock at $8.50 a share. She kept
up on developments by attending annual meetings. "It's so
much easier to keep track of companies in your local area,"
she says.</p>
<p>Her personal knowledge paid off. Last September Nitto
Denko Corp., an Osaka, Japan, electrical-insulating concern,
acquired Graphic Technology for $18.50 a share.</p>
<p>But investors who follow the "backyard strategy" need to
do thorough research and diversify their stock portfolios.
Small, regional stocks should be only one part of a balanced
stock portfolio also made up of large and medium-sized
companies, says Ernest Felzani, a Boston, Mass., investor who
runs a rental-car agency.</p>
<p>Just picking any small regional stock won't do. Although
over the long term, small stocks as a class have outperformed
large stocks, small stocks have underperformed larger stocks
for the past six years.</p>
<p>And small stocks are more volatile. John Hoffman, director
of emerging-growth research for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., says he picked 25 small stocks in 1989 for the firm's
customers. On the average, they outperformed the Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index by seven percentage points. But some
of the stocks were up as much as 100% -- and some fell as
much as 50%, he says.</p>
<p>Investors who buy shares in local companies can also be
blindsided by becoming boosters instead of hard-nosed
analysts, says Judith Russ Leon, of Dartmouth, Mass. Ms.
Leon, who works as a medical technologist, is active in
several investment clubs. Local publications have a soft spot
for local companies and can become too protective, she says.</p>
<p>Ms. Leon says one of her investment clubs took a bath on
Wang Laboratories Inc. Several years ago, local papers said
that the computer company had "temporary" problems but that
its long-term outlook was strong, she says. Ms. Leon tried to
convince other club members to sell the stock but, lulled by
the local rah-rah spirit, the other members decided to hold.
The stock, which was selling around $20 a share when she
urged the club to sell, closed yesterday at $4.125, down 25
cents, on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Still, even investment professionals say that if
individuals do their homework, this is one arena where the
"little guy" can beat the Wall Street pro.</p>
<p>Evonne Hurst, a Brookfield, Wis., investor and bookkeeper,
is a case in point. Her first husband worked for Racine
Hydraulics Co., a company run by James Mohrhauser. Ms. Hurst
got to know Mr. Mohrhauser and was "tremendously impressed"
with his entrepreneurial abilities. After Racine was
swallowed up by a larger firm, Mr. Mohrhauser started another
company called Versa Technologies Inc., which makes
engineered fluid power products. The tiny company began
racking up steady earnings and sales gains.</p>
<p>In 1983, Ms. Hurst purchased 100 shares for a total of
$850, way before analysts even heard of Versa Tech. The
company expanded into silicone-rubber products for food and
health-care markets. Today after several stock splits, Ms.
Hurst's stake is valued at $3,100.</p>
<p>And today Wall Street has discovered Versa Tech.
Institutions own 47% of the stock.</p>
