	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Declining exports forced South
Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. to narrow to $216 million
between January and March from $1.17 billion a year earlier,
the Trade and Industry Ministry reported.
   It was South Korea's smallest first-quarter trade surplus
with its No. 1 trading partner since 1982, when Korea began
to show bilateral annual trade surpluses on a sustained
basis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plunge in bilateral surpluses was attributed to a fall
in exports coupled with a rapid rise in imports.</p>
<p>South Korean exports to the U.S. in the first quarter
decreased 7% from the same period last year to $4.19 billion,
while imports from the U.S. jumped 19% to $3.97 billion.</p>
