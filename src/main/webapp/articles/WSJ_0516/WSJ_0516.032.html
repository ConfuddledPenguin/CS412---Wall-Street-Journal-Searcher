	<p class="article-leader">It looks like a political campaign in the American
heartland -- except it is in Sofia, Bulgaria.
   As Secretary of State James Baker's black Cadillac
limousine pulls up to the Sheraton Sofia Hotel on Lenin
Square, more than a thousand enthusiastic Bulgarians wave
hand-lettered signs saying "USA -- your democracy is our
dream" and chant, "So-fi-a, Wash-ing-ton."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Baker is uncomfortable. He hustles up the steps,
offering the crowd only an awkward smile and stiff wave. His
press spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, steps in and urges him
to say something. He turns and offers a few limp phrases
about America's admiration for what Bulgaria's people are
doing. Then, he flees inside, where he conducts a
closed-door, two-hour seminar for Bulgarian opposition
leaders on how to beat the ruling Communists in the country's
first free election.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, whose natural habitat is the smoke-filled room,
has displayed his skill in political tactics during his first
year in office. With communism collapsing from Moscow to
Managua, he forged a bipartisan foreign policy at home, kept
America's allies united and built a solid relationship with
his Soviet counterpart. All the while, he courted Congress
and the press.</p>
<p>But now the tactician must show a feel for strategy. The
recent upheavals have made him the first post-Cold War
secretary of state. Before him is a world-wide realignment of
power that requires not just wheeling and dealing but also a
clear sense of direction from the U.S. So far, though, he and
President Bush have had trouble presenting a comprehensive
strategy.</p>
<p>"Baker is very skillful at negotiating every sharp turn in
the road," says Burton Yale Pines, an official at the
conservative Heritage Foundation. "But what I see missing
from U.S. foreign policy is a grand sense of where we are
going."</p>
<p>Mr. Baker declines to comment on the view that he lacks a
long-term strategy or vision. But a close adviser bristles at
the criticism: "We say just judge him by the results. Was it
vision to come up with the compromise on Central America? Was
it vision to come up with the NATO arms-control proposals?
You can't do those things without a strategy."</p>
<p>Clearly, however, clever tactics, not grand strategy, got
Mr. Baker where he is today. Texas-bred and
Princeton-educated, he honed keen political skills as a
campaign chairman for Presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. Few
people in U.S. history have played such important roles in so
many successful presidential campaigns. And few have built
such spectacular resumes: Mr. Baker has moved in succession
through three of Washington's top posts, from White House
chief of staff to Treasury secretary to State, mastering the
arcane details of policy all the way.</p>
<p>But by experience and instinct, he manages foreign policy
as if he were still on the campaign trail. During the Bush
campaign, an old colleague recalls, Mr. Baker would canvass
top aides every morning on what the candidate needed to do
that day. Then, the colleague says, "He'd call Bush and say,
`Here's what's important today.' He really did control
things."</p>
<p>The disadvantage in that closely held operating style,
says another former campaign worker, was that "if you weren't
in the inner circle -- and I wasn't -- you never saw the
guy." That could prove more dangerous in international
diplomacy, where Mr. Baker is still a newcomer, than it did
in presidential campaigning, where he is regarded as a
black-belt master.</p>
<p>At State, as in the past, Mr. Baker relies almost
exclusively on a few intensely loyal, youthful aides who were
by his side at Treasury or in campaigns. To the chagrin of
career diplomats, the small in-group handles important issues
such as German unification, Soviet relations and Mideast
peace talks.</p>
<p>For instance, it was Robert Zoellick, a former Treasury
official, Bush campaign adviser and now State Department
counselor, who was dispatched to Bonn earlier this month to
prepare for the Allies' talks on German reunification. Only
the day before, Mr. Zoellick had returned from Mexico, where
he led a trade delegation.</p>
<p>Unlike many of his predecessors, who often hit stone walls
in dealing with the White House, Mr. Baker speaks by
telephone with his "candidate," George Bush, at least a
half-dozen times a day. In a small but symbolic show of
power, he sometimes phones the Oval Office in the middle of
the president's daily 8 a.m. meeting with National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, a potential rival.</p>
<p>The frequent telephone talks permit Messrs. Bush and Baker
to discuss problems or make quick decisions unencumbered by
the bureaucracy. They enjoy a mutual confidence dating back
to the 1960s, when they were doubles partners on the tennis
courts of Houston's country clubs. Recently, for instance,
President Bush needed quick advice before heading into a
White House meeting with four congressmen who wanted the
administration's view on legislation that would guarantee
$400 million in housing loans to help resettle Soviet Jews in
Israel. Most presidents would have turned for in-house help
from the national security adviser. Instead, Mr. Bush phoned
Mr. Baker.</p>
<p>"The president and Jim Baker have a social relationship
that's very different," says White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu. "There's no introductory language necessary; they
communicate in shorthand with each other."</p>
<p>The unusually tight White House tie also makes Mr. Baker a
formidable secretary of state to his peers abroad. "He is so
close to the president you can rely on everything he tells
you," says West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher.</p>
<p>So far, Mr. Baker's instincts have served the
administration well. Early in the Bush presidency, Mr. Baker
surmised that what was being viewed as Mr. Bush's excessive
caution would curtail the honeymoon usually accorded new
administrations. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was
dazzling the world while the U.S. was bogged down with an
ill-advised foreign-policy review that yielded only an empty
slogan, "beyond containment."</p>
<p>The administration's foreign-policy strategists gathered
at the White House. Aides such as Mr. Scowcroft urged a
go-slow approach. But the new secretary of state, though
still learning his job, took charge. "Baker insisted that, by
the May {1989} NATO summit, the president would have to be
ready to assume the leadership of the West with a bold
approach. It was like getting ready for a debate or a
primary," recalls a senior aide.</p>
<p>The result was a Bush proposal last May in Brussels to
negotiate cuts in American troops and Western aircraft in
Europe. Mr. Bush's proposal was, in part, just a clever
public-relations move because the cuts were almost
inevitable. But afterward, Mr. Bush was viewed, for the first
time, as having seized the diplomatic initiative from Mr.
Gorbachev.</p>
<p>For all that, Messrs. Bush and Baker haven't yet
demonstrated skill in navigating beyond the medium range.
After much hesitation, they tied themselves to Mr.
Gorbachev's future, even declining to support Lithuania's
independence drive in hopes of nailing down U.S.-Soviet
arms-reduction agreements. Mr. Baker will try to close these
deals today in crucial pre-summit talks in Moscow. But if
that reliance on Mr. Gorbachev fails, the Baker-Bush strategy
will hit a dead end: The administration has no post-Gorbachev
plan.</p>
<p>"There's a lack of historical background for what's
happening," complains one senior administration official
(who, like most others, would criticize the powerful Mr.
Baker only if he wasn't identified). That lack sometimes
hampers Mr. Baker's response to Soviet reforms or Mideast
peace moves, the official argues: "There's not, sometimes,
the sense that these things have happened before." Indeed,
Mr. Scowcroft's deputy, Robert Gates, has publicly implied
that the Baker approach is naive because it doesn't recognize
that earlier Soviet reform efforts have failed.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker also has missed a chance to channel foreign aid
to emerging democracies. Instead, tactician-like, he is
asking Congress for flexibility to shift existing funds as he
goes along.</p>
<p>Some critics complain that his voice has been
conspicuously absent from the troubled U.S. policy toward
China. His aides are quick to shield him, saying President
Bush, who was once U.S. envoy there, "is his own secretary of
state for China."</p>
<p>Yet such distance from messy problems is a hallmark of Mr.
Baker's career. "His secret of success is he's so adroit at
being able to separate himself from issues that become
unpopular," says GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum. As Treasury
Secretary Mr. Baker was one of the Reagan administration's
top financial officials -- yet he isn't commonly linked to
the savings-and-loan disaster that occurred partly on his
watch. And although he ran Mr. Bush's last campaign, he
wasn't criticized for its mean-spirited tone, which was
characterized by pro-Bush advertisements featuring a black
rapist, Willie Horton.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker makes no bones about picking his issues. "It has
always been my view that it is important to prioritize,
particularly in the expenditure of presidential capital," he
says in a comment that, in a bit of a departure, is on the
record.</p>
<p>Added up, his traits help him excel in the diplomatic art
of damage control. Last May, he delivered a speech calling on
Israel to give up its dream of maintaining control over the
West Bank. The address was received coolly by many American
Jews. A week later, he invited several pro-Israel members of
the House Foreign Affairs Committee to his office for drinks.
He explained he was trying to prod Israel toward peace talks
with the Palestinians and thus was doing Israel a favor.</p>
<p>"Baker likes dealing with politicians," says one
representative who attended the session, Howard Berman of
California. "George Shultz had a lot of respect on the Hill.
But you never got the impression he enjoyed being up here.
With Baker, you do get that feeling."</p>
<p>Few of his predecessors courted Congress as ardently as he
does. As an ironclad rule, he returns every member's
telephone call, if possible on the same day. He is a regular
visitor on Capitol Hill, where he spent 40 hours negotiating
his first foreign-policy triumph, a bipartisan agreement on
Nicaragua. The deal he cut was based on his shrewd
recognition that lawmakers no longer had the stomach to fight
over military aid to the Contras.</p>
<p>When preparing for his confirmation hearing before the
Senate Foreign Relations panel, he visited each member
individually, working them as if they were key delegates at a
political convention. Sen. Kassebaum recalls that he arrived
alone in her office for a long chat and jotted notes on a pad
as they spoke. "You thought, `My gosh, he's interested in my
issues,'" the Kansas Republican says.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker also works hard to forge personal bonds with
foreign officials, especially Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and West Germany's Mr. Genscher. Initially
hostile to Mr. Genscher's dovish views on U.S. missiles in
Germany, Mr. Baker gradually built a friendship with him. A
little flattery helped. To contrast his own inexperience at
diplomacy with Mr. Genscher's 17-year tenure, Mr. Baker calls
him "the Dean."</p>
<p>Mr. Baker cultivates the press, too. A month after moving
into Foggy Bottom, he threw a cocktail party for reporters
and their spouses, prompting many foreign-service officers to
gripe that they still hadn't met their new boss. He has
granted more than 150 news interviews during the past year --
usually in the guise of a "senior official" -- far more than
his predecessor.</p>
<p>But despite his hospitality, Mr. Baker got off to a rocky
start with the State Department press corps. On his first
diplomatic trip abroad, matters of state were overshadowed by
a news story about his ownership of Chemical Bank stock while
he was Treasury secretary. Mr. Baker appeared shocked when
reporters on his plane pressed him about this apparent
conflict of interest rather than foreign affairs.
Characteristically, he quickly cut his losses, announcing en
route to Rome that he would sell all his publicly traded
securities.</p>
<p>On overseas trips these days, Mr. Baker customarily
wanders back to the airplane's press section, wearing an
electric-blue nylon warm-up suit, to banter with reporters
and kibbitz during their games of "liar's poker," which
involves betting on the serial numbers on dollar bills.
Recently, appearing while a game was in progress, he unfurled
a huge sheet of uncut single bills bearing his signature from
his days as Treasury secretary and joked: "I'm ready to play
now."</p>
