	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and its
unions agreed on a non-management retirement plan that would
raise the number of eligible workers to 33,500 from 18,000,
keeping the company's work force-reduction plans on track.
   AT&T says it won't be able to assess the financial impact
of the accord until it knows how many workers will take
advantage of it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement, which had been expected, also empowers
individual AT&T units to offer additional incentives to the
new plan to encourage workers in superfluous jobs to leave
without sacrificing their early retirement benefits.</p>
<p>"Unions tend to be one-size fits all, and this allows
individual units to respond better to their own business
conditions," said an AT&T spokesman. For example, AT&T's
Network Services division will cut 6,000 surplus jobs because
it doesn't need as many people to maintain a phone network
that has been upgraded to more modern digital equipment.</p>
<p>AT&T had said that it would have to lay off the workers
without full early retirement benefits if it didn't receive
an agreement on the special incentives from the unions -- the
Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.</p>
<p>The new plan adds three years of age and three years of
service to the records of all non-management employees as of
May 1. These added years accelerate eligibility and increase
the pension payout to each worker.</p>
<p>In addition, individual units with a surplus of workers
will be able to offer an incentive of two additional years of
age and two more years of seniority for workers. The units
can also offer a "sweetener" that raises monthly pension
payments 15% a month.</p>
<p>All told, AT&T has firm plans this year to consolidate
numerous office and manufacturing sites and to cut 12,800
non-management jobs. The company currently has 165,400
non-managers out of 281,000 workers. That is about 92,000
fewer workers than in January 1984 when AT&T was broken up
and 28,000 less than AT&T had 17 months ago.</p>
