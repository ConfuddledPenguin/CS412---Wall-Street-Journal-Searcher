	<p class="article-leader">In a move that completes its takeover of Penrod Drilling
Corp., an investment group that includes Texas financier
Richard Rainwater said it purchased the 31.8% of Penrod debt
and equity that it didn't already own for about $161.3
million.
   The transaction pushes the total price tag for the huge,
Dallas-based drilling concern to about $430 million and marks
the end of a heated bidding war over one of the world's
largest and most modern fleets of offshore rigs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The buyers, an investment group that also includes
Houston-based Energy Service Company Inc. (Ensco) and R.D.
Smith & Co., a New York brokerage and investment concern,
have said they plan to restructure Penrod. "We see the value
here in Penrod as an operative, going concern," said C.
Christopher Gaut, Ensco's chief financial officer. He
declined to provide restructuring details or say whether the
investors planned to sell any portion of the 84-rig Penrod
fleet.</p>
<p>Ensco said closing of the current transaction is subject
to financing and may occur anytime prior to Oct. 31, 1990.
The purchasers have agreed to pay the sellers interest on the
$161.3 million purchase price from May 11 until the closing.
If the transaction is completed as outlined, Ensco and its
affiliated partnerships will own 58.6% of Penrod and R.D.
Smith and its affiliates will own about 41.4%.</p>
