	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Dravo Corp. has agreed to enter a guilty
plea to one count of mail fraud in connection with a criminal
filing prepared by the U.S. Attorney for South Carolina.
   The government's filing, which Dravo revealed in a report
to the Securities and Exchange Commission, stems from
improper charges for steel pipe provided in 1985 by a former
Dravo division to the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah
River, S.C., plant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In agreeing to enter a guilty plea, Dravo said it would
reimburse the Department of Energy for $165,000, the amount
improperly billed.</p>
<p>Dravo noted that while a fine may be imposed as part of
the sentence, the company does not believe that either the
fine, or restitution, will have a material effect on the
company's financial performance.</p>
