	<p class="article-leader">Northern Telecom Ltd., New York, is expected to announce
today a $100 million project to build a new research and
development facility to house its research and development
operations in the Ottawa area, according to individuals
familiar with the company's plans.
   Northern, which has been seeking ways to cut overhead,
declined to comment on its plans. But the telecommunications
equipment manufacturer currently maintains satellite research
and development operations in three leased sites in the
Ottawa area. These work with its main Bell Northern Research
Center in Nepean, Ont., in a building that is owned by
Northern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new facility will be built next to the existing BNR
lab in Nepean, and will add 600,000 square feet to the
operation, bringing the total space to 1.3 million square
feet, the individuals said. Northern currently employs 4,500
workers in its Ottawa research and development operations.</p>
<p>They said the consolidation into the new site won't lead
to a work-force reduction.</p>
