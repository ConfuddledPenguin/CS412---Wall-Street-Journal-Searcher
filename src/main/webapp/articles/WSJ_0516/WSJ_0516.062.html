	<p class="article-leader">Stock prices eked out another all-time high, but bonds
fell modestly as investors turned cautious. The dollar was
mixed.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained a scant 0.92 to
2822.45 in moderate trading. But other broader measures of
the stock market lost ground, and 856 issues declined on the
New York Stock Exchange while 654 rose.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the speed with which stocks rose during the
past few days has made investors jittery and inclined to take
profits. Indeed, the industrial average fell 14 points in
early trading before recovering and hovering around the
record level set Monday. But some analysts said they were
surprised there wasn't more selling, especially after the
dollar weakened against the yen and bond prices slumped.</p>
<p>"I think everyone was looking for a big correction," said
Thomas Callahan, senior vice president of U.S. equities at
Yamaichi International (America).</p>
<p>Charles Clough, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch,
said he doesn't see any evidence that the current rally is
the beginning of a bull market. Nevertheless, he added that
prices could continue to climb for weeks, if not months,
subject to sudden shifts in investor sentiment that could
make stock prices volatile.</p>
<p>Just as the rapid runup in stock prices created
opportunities for profit taking in that market, so did the
sharp rally in bond prices last week and early this week.
Bond prices dropped as trading got under way in New York,
then stabilized at lower levels for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>Some traders said the rally that brought the yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond to less than 8.6% from more
than 9% two weeks ago was probably the result of optimism
overrunning the sense of caution that had prevailed in the
bond market for weeks.</p>
<p>But caution returned as traders saw the dollar sinking
against the yen and looked at their bulging inventories of
bonds, the result mostly of last week's record auction of new
Treasury debt. Although many traders expect good news on
inflation today with the release of the April consumer price
index, the chance of a negative surprise keeps them wary.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices crept higher. Trading volume on the New York
Stock Exchange slackened to 165.7 million shares from more
than 225 million Monday.</p>
<p>Bond prices were off. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond fell three-eighths of a point, or about $3.75 for each
$1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue climbed to
8.65%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late afternoon New York trading
the currency was at 1.6465 marks and 150.80 yen compared with
1.6425 marks and 152.47 yen Monday.</p>
