	<p class="article-leader">LEISURE TECHNOLOGY Inc. said it won't make the June 1
dividend payment on its $2.25 cumulative convertible
exchangeable preferred stock. "It's not a well kept secret
that the housing business is in very difficult
circumstances," said Michael L. Tenzer, chairman, president
and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles real estate
developer. He said the company's housing results are poor in
the northeastern U.S. and in Florida and have moderated in
California. He declined to indicate if the previous
56-cent-a-share quarterly dividend on the preferred would be
resumed in subsequent quarters. For the third quarter ended
Dec. 31, the company reported net income of $231,000 on
revenue of $55.5 million.</p>
