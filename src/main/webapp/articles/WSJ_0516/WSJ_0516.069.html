	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Galveston-Houston Co. said it hired Goldman,
Sachs & Co. and Simmons & Co. International to formulate a
plan to enhance shareholder value.
   In April, the company said its chairman, president and
chief executive officer, Nathan M. Avery, would resign to
assume a post with the Commerce Department, and that it would
hire advisers to help determine the best course of action.
Galveston-Houston manufactures oil and natural gas drilling
and production equipment.</p>
