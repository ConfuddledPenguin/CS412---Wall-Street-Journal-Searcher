	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The world's record for a work of art was
shattered last night at Christie's International PLC's major
spring art auction as Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr.
Gachet," fetched $82.5 million.
   The heartbreakingly beautiful oil-on-canvas of the
troubled painter's physician and friend, which formerly hung
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art on loan from its owner, was
reportedly purchased by Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo. It had
been expected to sell for $40 million to $50 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Christie's, the packed saleroom erupted in applause as
the fevered bidding broke $50 million, appearing to put to
rest concerns that the art boom, at least regarding the great
works, is history. However, while the sale was by-and-large
successful, with the majority of the artworks selling, the
prices fetched tended to be at or below Christie's lowest
presale estimate. The prices indicated a cooling of the
recent art market frenzy. But while bidding wasn't quite as
frantic as in recent years, it proceeded at a fast clip.
About 19% of the art works went unsold.</p>
<p>The record price for the van Gogh eclipsed the previous
record for van Gogh's "Irises," which was set at Sotheby's
auction house in November 1987 and was later tainted by the
disclosure that the purchaser, Australian businessman, Alan
Bond, had never paid for it. "Irises" was later sold to the
Getty Museum in Los Angeles, for a price that wasn't
disclosed.</p>
<p>The attention now turns to Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s
auction Thursday evening. The centerpiece of the Sotheby's
auction is Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "Au Moulin de la
Gallette." It is expected to sell for $40 million to $50
million.</p>
