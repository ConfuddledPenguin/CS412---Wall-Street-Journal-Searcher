	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is pushing
legislation that would vastly expand federal prosecutors'
ability to freeze the assets of defendants in fraud cases
before trial and permanently seize the assets after a
conviction.
   The proposed bill would build on what prosecutors consider
to be their successful use of existing laws that allow them
to seize the assets of drug traffickers, money launderers and
racketeers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new legislation, sent to Congress last month, has
already attracted powerful bipartisan support. Chairman
Joseph Biden (D., Del.) of the Senate Judiciary Committee and
South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, the panel's ranking
Republican, are expected to introduce a bill similar to the
Justice Department's proposal, possibly as soon as this week.</p>
<p>In 1989, a record $580 million was forfeited to the
Justice Department as investigative agencies such as the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation increased their efforts to track down drug
criminals' illicit proceeds. Much of this activity became
possible when Congress gave prosecutors wider latitude to
seek forfeiture of assets tangentially related to criminal
activity, as opposed to illegal profits alone.</p>
<p>The bill being promoted by the Justice Department would
extend forfeiture provisions to cover assets that are the
"gross receipts" of fraud involving use of the U.S. mail,
credit cards and computers, as well as military-procurement
fraud and fraud against federal programs such as Medicare. A
defendant's legitimately acquired assets wouldn't be subject
to forfeiture under the legislation.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would allow prosecutors to attempt to
seize assets either during a criminal trial or in a separate
civil proceeding. Under the civil approach, illegally gained
assets may be frozen quickly, before a defendant has a chance
to hide them, according to Barry Stern, a Justice Department
official involved in crafting the proposed laws. A central
goal of the expanded forfeiture provisions is to allow money
to be returned to the government or to private victims of
fraud, Mr. Stern said.</p>
<p>Some defense lawyers, civil libertarians and criminal
targets have criticized the government's expanding efforts to
seize assets as excessively punitive and possibly
unconstitutional. These criticisms have arisen, for example,
in securities-manipulation cases prosecuted under existing
racketeering statutes.</p>
