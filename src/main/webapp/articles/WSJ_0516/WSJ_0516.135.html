	<p class="article-leader">Cincinnati Milacron Inc. said it received a contract for
more than $6 million to supply plastics molding equipment to
Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA, a unit of Toyota Motor Corp.
of Japan.
   Both Milacron and Toyota said the contract is a
breakthrough because it marks the beginning of a long-term
supplier relationship between Milacron and Toyota's plant in
Georgetown, Ky. The plastics machinery currently in operation
at Georgetown was purchased in Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Three large injection molding machines and related
equipment will be supplied by the Cincinnati company. The
machines will be used to make large interior plastic parts
for Toyota Camry sedans and a new station wagon that Toyota
will introduce in 1992.</p>
<p>The machinery is to be installed at the Georgetown
facility in May 1991.</p>
