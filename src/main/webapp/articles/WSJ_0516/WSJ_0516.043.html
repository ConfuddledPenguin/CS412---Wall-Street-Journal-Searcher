	<p class="article-leader">Your April 17 editorial "Protectionist the Dolphins" was
too much. Are you seriously advocating the idea that it's OK
to kill about 13,000 dolphins so tuna fishermen can keep
their jobs? And that life as we know it will end if American
children can't exercise their God-given right to a tuna-fish
sandwich?
   I also like your argument that it's OK for American tuna
boats to kill dolphins because otherwise they won't be
competitive with foreign tuna boats that will continue
killing dolphins.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. corporations that have finally chosen to stop the
dolphin slaughter (albeit too late for many thousands,
perhaps millions, of dolphins) should certainly be rewarded
with a dolphin-safe label on their cans. Your own recent
survey showed that Americans want to help the environment and
this is one way the marketplace can better inform the
consumer to make environmentally sound decisions.</p>

<p>"Protectionist the Dolphins" is aptly stated, for we will
certainly pay more for unsullied bottlenose-dolphin-excluded
tuna fish. But what is never mentioned is what is done with
the nearly 13,000 dolphins killed each year. Should we assume
that what is probably wonderful beeflike meat is just thrown
to the sharks and never used for human consumption? I would
love to buy dolphin meat for nourishment and to enjoy its
taste.</p>
<p>No one gets upset about butchering steers, so why would
anyone feel any differently about dolphins that are unlucky
enough to be caught in tuna nets? What a shame to waste them.
The press should give us a more complete picture of
dolphin-meat usage in the tuna-fishing industry. Or does it
fetch too high a price in some other countries for anyone to
want to talk about it?</p>
<p>Historically, did whaler crews, pirates and others use
dolphins as a source of fresh red meat? Does the Marine
Mammal Protection Act of 1972 fail to provide for a sensible
use of dolphins that may be killed inadvertently such as in
tuna fishing?</p>
