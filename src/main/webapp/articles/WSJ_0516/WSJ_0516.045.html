	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Farm Credit System's first-quarter profit
rose 8.5% as the big agricultural lender's fundamental
financial condition continued to improve.
   Net income for the quarter was $191 million, up from $176
million a year earlier. More indicative of the borrower-owned
system's health, however, was a 34% rise in net interest
income -- basically, interest collected on loans minus
interest paid out to bondholders -- to $321 million from $239
million in the 1989 quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The improvement was due to lower borrowing costs as
high-interest-rate bonds retired, and an improvement in new
loan volume and in the condition of existing loans.</p>
<p>Loans rose about $500 million during the quarter to $49.63
billion. Nonperforming assets, meanwhile, declined by about
$87 million during the period to $2.93 billion. And so-called
other high-risk loans fell about $100 million to $4.44
billion.</p>
<p>The system, which received a federal bailout in the
mid-1980s after the farm economy's slump drove it to the
brink of insolvency, also continued to lessen its use of an
unusual accounting technique that boosted profits
substantially in prior years. The so-called negative
provision for loan losses -- meaning money is taken out of
the reserve for losses and recorded as profit -- was $18
million in the first quarter, compared with $75 million a
year ago.</p>
<p>The technique is allowable under accounting rules, but its
use is rare.</p>
