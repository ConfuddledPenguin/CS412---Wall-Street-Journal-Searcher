	<p class="article-leader">Castle & Cooke Inc., Los Angeles, said that its planned
spinoff of its Dole Food Co. unit has been delayed
indefinitely because of financing concerns and uncertainty
over the tax treatment of the transaction.
   The spinoff to shareholders is intended to split Castle &
Cooke into two separate companies, one containing the Dole
operations and the other, Castle & Cooke's smaller
real-estate development operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Castle & Cooke proposed the spinoff in February, it
said the transaction would be completed by the end of next
month, subject to various approvals, including an Internal
Revenue Service ruling that the transaction would be tax-free
to the company and to its shareholders.</p>
<p>"The revenue ruling has not yet been received and very
recently there has been a substantial tightening of credit
available for companies in the real-estate industry," Castle
& Cooke said.</p>
<p>The company said its board decided against proceeding with
the transaction as long as "acceptable bank financing" isn't
available to the independent real-estate development company
that would be created.</p>
