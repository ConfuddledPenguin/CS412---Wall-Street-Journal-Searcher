	<p class="article-leader">COSTA MESA, Calif. -- ICN Biomedicals Inc. said it
adjusted the price it paid to buy the biomedical business of
GRC International Inc. to $37.6 million from $41.5 million.
   ICN and GRC International, formerly Flow General Inc.,
signed a definitive agreement for ICN to buy the biomedical
business last October; the accord was subject to an audit of
its inventories. An ICN spokesman said a drop in the level of
those inventories between Flow's July 31 fiscal year end,
which was used to formulate the original purchase price, and
Dec. 31 prompted the adjustment.</p>
