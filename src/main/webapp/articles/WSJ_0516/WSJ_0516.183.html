	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Losses at Cineplex Odeon Corp. continued in the
first quarter of 1990, with the beleagured movie theater
chain reporting a net loss of $11.9 million, or 25 cents a
share, on revenue of $139.7 million.
   In the first quarter of 1989, Cineplex reported net income
of $10.7 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $128.5
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the loss narrowed from Cineplex's fourth-quarter
loss of 91 cents a share, analysts note that the loss from
continuing operations of $32.1 million, or 67 cents a share,
was considerably higher than the market had been expecting.</p>
<p>The biggest blow to Cineplex's first-quarter results came
from a $15 million charge, a provision for estimated losses
on asset sales now under negotiation. The company said those
sales are expected to close during the second quarter. That
charge offset a $15 million gain on the sale of Cineplex's
residual interest in Universal Studios Florida.</p>
<p>Lisbeth Barron, vice president of research at S.G. Warburg
& Co. in New York, said that the size of Cineplex's loss
wasn't surprising.</p>
<p>"It takes a while to turn around operations like this; it
can't be done quickly," she said.</p>
<p>The interest payable on Cineplex's bank debt rose from
$12.2 million in the first quarter of 1989, to $14.3 million
in the first quarter of 1990, the company said, despite a
decrease in long-term debt of $46.1 million in the same
period. Cineplex said it currently has $531.9 million in
long-term debt.</p>
<p>Cineplex reported an 18% increase in box office revenue
for the first quarter, compared to a U.S. industry average
gain of 2%. Allen Karp, president and chief operating officer
of Cineplex, said he is "particularly encouraged" by the
surge.</p>
