	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors bought blue chips again, nudging the
Dow Jones Industrial Average to another all-time high, but
broader market indexes snapped their long string of gains
because of profit-taking.
   The industrial average closed up 0.92 to 2822.45. Standard
& Poor's 500-Stock Index and the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index both fell, capping 11-session winning streaks
that began April 30. The S&P 500 dropped 0.47 to 354.28, the
composite index lost 0.34 to 193.31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Declining issues outpaced advancers by 856 to 654 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 165,730,000
shares compared with 225,410,000 shares Monday. Declines in
broader indexes reflected the cautious attitude money
managers have about the latest rally.</p>
<p>James Wright, chief investment officer at Banc One Asset
Management Corp., says he still hasn't changed the asset
allocation in an account that is 40% stocks, 15% cash and 45%
bonds. "I would have adjusted my equity position up if I
really believed the rally," he said.</p>
<p>Expectations of slowing inflation are driving the bond
market, which has a big influence over stocks currently, he
said. "The bond market is not at all predictable, and it is
running the stock market quite clearly," Mr. Wright said. He
believes stock traders could get whipsawed if bond prices
swing again on today's report of the consumer price index for
April.</p>
<p>The report is expected to show that both the overall index
and the "core inflation rate" -- a measure of prices
excluding volatile food and energy products -- gained 0.3%
last month, according to a consensus estimate of economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. The index
gained 0.5% in February and March.</p>
<p>Traders are also cautious about the stock market because
they haven't seen many of their foreign customers stepping up
to buy U.S. equities. But the yen's strength against the
dollar may encourage some Japanese investors to buy soon.
Japan's fiscal year began in April, one trader at Daiwa
Securities America said, and so many institutional investors
are looking for a propitious time to buy U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns, noted
that stock prices held ground despite a weaker bond market
and a sharp decline in a recent market darling, Deere & Co.</p>
<p>Deere dropped 2 1/8 to 75 on 1.9 million shares. Goldman
Sachs lowered its earnings estimate for the fiscal year
ending in October by 15 cents a share, to $6.35. Analyst
Thomas Burns said he took the action after the company told
him it had cut prices on some of its farm tractors, according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>American Express climbed 1 3/8 to 30 5/8 on 2.2 million
shares on renewed rumors that the company would sell its
Shearson Lehman Hutton securities unit to Primerica. American
Express strongly denied the rumors -- "I categorically deny
them," said a spokesman -- while Primerica said it "as a
matter of policy doesn't comment on rumors." American Express
has agreed to buy the remaining publicly traded shares of
Shearson, subject to a shareholders' vote expected in June.</p>
<p>Primerica rose 5/8 to 31 7/8. Other blue chips to bolster
the Dow industrial average included International Business
Machines, which went up 1 3/8 to 115 5/8, International
Paper, up 1 to 51 5/8, Allied-Signal, up 1 1/8 to 37 1/4, and
Procter & Gamble, up 3/8 to 76 1/8.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer climbed 2 1/8 to 114 1/2. Analysts at a
number of brokerage firms made favorable comments on the
stock after a meeting with company officials.</p>
<p>Federal National Mortgage Association gained 3/8 to 38 1/4
on two million shares, recovering from its sell-off Monday
after the Treasury urged Congress to require Fannie Mae and
other government-sponsored agencies to seek triple-A credit
ratings that wouldn't be based on implicit federal guarantees
for their debt.</p>
<p>The affected agencies include Federal Home Loan Mortgage,
which also rebounded by climbing 1 to 70 1/8, and Student
Loan Marketing Association, which slid an additional 3/8 to
48 3/8 after falling 1 3/4 points Monday.</p>
<p>Marsh & McLennan gained 1 1/8 to 73 3/8 after boosting its
quarterly dividend by 4% to 65 cents a share. Other financial
stocks to attract buyers included Household International,
which went up 1 to 46 3/4, Chase Manhattan, up 3/8 to 25 3/4,
and J.P. Morgan, up 1/2 to 37 3/4.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments rose 2 1/4 to 39 7/8. In reaffirming a
"buy" recommendation, Kidder Peabody boosted its estimates of
the company's 1990 and 1991 earnings and established a target
price of $75 a share for the stock, which carries the firm's
highest investment rating.</p>
<p>A utility issue, Niagara Mohawk Power, gained 3/8 to 14
1/8. B. Ralph Sylvia, who engineered a turnaround at Detroit
Edison's Fermi 2 nuclear plant, resigned his post at that
company to run Niagara Mohawk's troubled nuclear operations.</p>
<p>J.C. Penney lost 1 3/8 to 65 1/4. While the company
reported that its first-quarter net income rose more than 20%
from a year earlier, the latest results fell short of most
analysts' projections.</p>
<p>News Corp. dropped 5/8 to 15 3/8 after reporting that
operating income for the nine months ended March 31 fell 53%
from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Tiffany, which posted a 29% increase in net income for the
fiscal first quarter ended last month, gained 1 to 43 1/4.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings lost 1/2 to 17 3/8 after a
disappointing start to the spring auction season for
impressionist and modern art. Habsburg, Feldman, a small,
Geneva-based auction house, sold only about 15% of the
paintings it put up for bids Monday in New York. But art
dealers said that the art Sotheby's will sell at its auction
tomorrow evening is far superior to the works offered by
Habsburg, Feldman.</p>
<p>Eagle-Picher Industries went down 1/8 to 3 3/4, below its
52-week low. Oppenheimer & Co. removed the stock from its
list of recommended issues, citing the number of asbestos
claims being filed against the company.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index snapped an
11-session winning streak by falling 0.78 to 353.56. Volume
totaled 14,510,000 shares compared with 16,170,000 Monday.</p>
<p>Blessings advanced 1 1/2 to 26 1/2. The company reported
an 88% surge in net income for the fiscal quarter ended April
21.</p>
<p>Healthvest gained 1/2 to 2 7/8. Private Capital
Management, an investment firm based in Naples, Fla., said it
holds a 4.96% stake in the company for clients as an
investment.</p>
<p>Divi Hotels, which said it doesn't plan to make an
interest payment due on one of its two issues of debt
securities, fell 1/2 to 3. The company is in the midst of an
exchange offer for both issues.</p>
