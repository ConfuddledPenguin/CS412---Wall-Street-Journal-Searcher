	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage companies declined across the board in
the week ended yesterday.
   "Treasury bill rates are coming down, so banks are eager
to lower their CD rates," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of
Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Average yields on small-denomination, consumer CDs slipped
the least, according to an 18-bank survey by Banxquote.
Average yields remained above 8% for longer-term maturities.
Yields fell to 8.02% from 8.10% on one-year CDs, and to 8.25%
from 8.32% on five-year CDs.</p>
<p>Small-denomination CDs sold through leading brokerage
companies showed a slightly greater decline in average
yields, but were still higher across the board than those
offered directly by banks. Average yields on six-month CDs
dropped to 8.22% from 8.34%, while average yields on two-year
CDs slid to 8.60% from 8.80%, according to figures compiled
by Banxquote.</p>
<p>Brokerage firms are typically able to offer
higher-yielding CDs because they shop for competitive yields
at banks across the country. They then buy CDs in bulk and
resell them to their customers as a service, without fees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which generally require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
also down. Average yields on six-month jumbo CDs declined to
7.93% from 8.07%, while one-year maturities dropped to 8.10%
from 8.25%. The only bank in the survey that offered a CD
with a yield of at least 9% was Continental Bank in Chicago,
which offered a 9% five-year jumbo.</p>
<p>Mr. Mehl expects CD yields to waffle for the next few
weeks, but cautions that when change comes, it may come
quickly. "If banks have an opportunity to lower the rates,"
he said, "they'll do it as fast as they can."</p>
