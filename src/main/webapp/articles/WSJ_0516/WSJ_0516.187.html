	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission charged a
Florida company with misrepresenting a paid television
commercial touting bee-pollen products as a consumer news
show and making unfounded claims.
   The agency said TV Inc. of Largo, Fla., and its president,
William Thompson, entered a proposed consent agreement to
settle the charges. TV Inc. produced the commercial. The
action is part of the FTC's crackdown on "infomercials," or
program-length advertisements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among other things, the proposed order would require TV
Inc. and Mr. Thompson to refrain from producing any
commercial that appears to be an independent program, and it
would require them to provide explicit notice during
commercials that run 15 minutes or longer that they are paid
advertisements.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson said the commercial was withdrawn in July
1989 after FTC lawyers indicated there was a problem with it.
"We happen to agree with what the FTC is doing," he said.
"Agencies such as ours need to be more responsible. Just
because a client says a product provides certain benefits, we
shouldn't automatically use it. We need more due-diligence."</p>
<p>The proposed consent agreement also would order TV Inc. to
send each customer who bought the bee-pollen products a
letter informing them of the FTC action.</p>
<p>The FTC said the 30-minute "TV Insiders" commercial, which
was carried over cable television networks and independent
stations, pitched Mountain-High bee-pollen products,
including Bee-Young tablets, Mountain-High Royal Jelly and
Pollen Energy 520 capsules.</p>
<p>The agency said the false material included claims that
bee-pollen products have successfully treated allergies; that
Alpine Supreme Brand Arthritis-Strength Pain Relief is an
effective pain killer; and that eating bee pollen can't
produce an allergic reaction.</p>
