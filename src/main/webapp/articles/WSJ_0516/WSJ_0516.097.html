	<p class="article-leader">LOVE IN CHINA</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A pioneering survey in China found many couples were
dissatisfied with sex and unhappy in their marriages.</p>
<p>"We found that Chinese marriages tend to be stable --
people shun divorce. But the quality of the marriages is not
good," Liu Daling of Shanghai University said. Mr. Liu said
the survey, which he described as the first of its kind,
involved interviews in 15 provinces with 23,000 people
ranging from sex offenders in prison to middle-school
students.</p>
<p>Half the 8,000 couples interviewed said they were just
putting up with their partners despite unfulfilled sex lives
and resulting unhappiness, Mr. Liu said. "Many people have
the idea of just making do with a bad marriage," he added.</p>
<p>Divorce is frowned on in China, and authorities often make
feuding couples sit through hours of mediation before
allowing a divorce. One reason: Divorce causes problems with
scarce housing.</p>
<p>INVESTING IN COLOMBIA</p>
<p>Foreign investment in Colombia dropped by more than half
in the first four months of this year because of uncertainty
over violence, economic policy and approaching elections, the
government said. A report by the National Planning Department
said the government approved $49.5 million of foreign
investment in the first four months of the year compared with
$112.3 million in the same period last year. The biggest
foreign investors were the U.S., with 67.5% of the total,
Britain, 11%, and Panama, 5.2%.</p>
<p>TAIWAN'S `POSITIVE MEASURE'</p>
<p>Taiwan wants to establish a mission in China to promote
trade and other unofficial ties, a Taiwan government
spokesman said. He said the mission would be a "positive
measure" that could "help solve the many problems arising
from exchanges {with China} and will contribute to the stable
and peaceful development across the Taiwan Strait." Taiwan
authorities now allow investment in China only if it is
channeled through companies in third countries.</p>
<p>HELP FROM DUTCH RETIREES</p>
<p>Newly retired Dutch executives will go to Eastern Europe
this year to pass on their managerial skills to fledgling
businesses and help in the process of developing market
economies. Under a Dutch government-backed program, between
40 and 50 of the highly qualified "pensioners" will go to
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany for several
months. The Dutch Economics Ministry said 672,000 guilders
($364,000) had been allocated for the program, whose
participants won't receive any salary but will have expenses
paid.</p>
<p>CHEATING IN BANGLADESH</p>
<p>Nearly 11,000 students in Bangladesh were expelled for
cheating and violence during three days of college-entry
examinations last week, education officials said. More than
200 students were arrested and about 100 teachers were
suspended for helping the cheaters, they said. Nearly 450,000
students are taking the month-long Secondary School
Certificate tests. There was violence in about 70 examination
centers where students demonstrated for the "right to cheat,"
attacked teachers and battled police.</p>
<p>ISRAELI INFLATION</p>
<p>Israel's consumer price index rose 2.5% in April, the
government announced. An increase in housing costs
contributed 0.8% to April's inflation figure, the Central
Bureau of Statistics said; that followed a rise of 1.3% in
February and of 2.2% in March. Rents and home-sale prices
have been pushed up by a housing shortage caused by an influx
of Soviet Jews. Inflation in the first four months of 1990
reached 5.5%, the bureau said. For all of 1989, consumer
prices rose by 20.7%.</p>
<p>JAPAN-U.S. FLIGHTS</p>
<p>Japan's Transportation Ministry said it was permitting
Japanese airlines to increase service to U.S. cities in the
wake of last fall's aviation negotiations.</p>
<p>The ministry said it authorized three companies to
establish new direct passenger flights to the U.S. from
Tokyo: Japan Air Lines Co. will operate three flights weekly
to Washington; All Nippon Airways Co., five to New York; and
Japan Air System Co., two to Honolulu. In addition, Japan Air
Lines will increase its service to Chicago to seven flights a
week from five currently.</p>
<p>Nippon Cargo Airlines Co. will also be allowed to operate
four cargo flights a week to Chicago and three to Los
Angeles. Japan Air Lines got authorization for four weekly
cargo flights to Chicago.</p>
<p>Transportation Minister Akira Ohno said his ministry
decided to authorize the new passenger and cargo flights "to
overcome international aviation competition."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Vietnam released a U.S. publisher whom it had detained for
three weeks, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Thailand
said. Mike Morrow, a Hong Kong resident and publisher of
Petroleum News, had been in Vietnam looking into investment
possibilities, according to friends; the Vietnamese
government hasn't stated the reason for his arrest. . . .
Scientists said they hope data from a computerized weather
station installed yesterday atop the Sphinx will help them
stop the 4,600-year-old monument's accelerating decay. "The
Sphinx has deteriorated more in the last 50 years than in all
previous centuries of its existence combined," said an
Egyptian official.</p>
