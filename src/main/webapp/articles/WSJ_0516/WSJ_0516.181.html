	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- NBC News, hoping to reclaim viewers who have
turned away from the "Today" show in droves, said that it is
adding a third host and that the program's senior executive
is stepping aside.
   The show, which had long held the No. 1 spot in the
morning ratings race, has been in turmoil since co-anchor
Jane Pauley left in January. She was succeeded by Deborah
Norville, and the show's ratings have fallen steadily since
then. They are now 18% below year-ago levels, according to
the A.C. Nielsen Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a move that has never been tried by the other networks,
and which NBC experimented with briefly but abandoned more
than five years ago, the General Electric Co. unit will put a
third anchor on the broadcast alongside Ms. Norville and
Bryant Gumbel. For that slot, the network is bringing back
one of the program's stars from its golden years --
sportscaster Joe Garagiola.</p>
<p>At the same time, NBC News Senior Vice President Dick
Ebersol, who is also president of NBC Sports, said he is
leaving his post as senior executive in charge of the "Today"
show. Mr. Ebersol engineered the removal of Ms. Pauley and
the promotion of Ms. Norville, who had been a news reader on
"Today." He will continue to work on program development for
the news division.</p>
<p>One senior NBC official said the network hopes Mr.
Garagiola, 64 years old, will add a "mature presence" to the
program and balance the relative youthfulness of Ms.
Norville. Ironically, the network initially wanted to add Ms.
Norville, 32, because of concern that the broadcast needed a
younger image. Ms. Pauley is 39.</p>
<p>The moves come two weeks before NBC is scheduled to meet
with its affiliates -- a meeting that is expected to be an
unusually contentious one between the No. 1 rated network and
the 200-plus stations affiliated with it. The NBC stations,
according to interviews with general managers, are furious
that the ratings for "Today" have plummeted since Ms.
Norville succeeded Ms. Pauley.</p>
<p>The show's ratings slide translates into millions of lost
advertising dollars for the network and the stations. Last
week in New York, for instance, "Today" finished last in the
ratings, not only behind its competition from the two
broadcast networks, but also behind cartoons on independent
stations and a news/talk show on News Corp.'s Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s station.</p>
<p>At a meeting of NBC News personnel in Princeton, N.J., in
April, NBC News President Michael Gartner acknowledged that
there had been discussions about removing Ms. Norville,
according to people who were at the session. Mr. Gartner
didn't return calls seeking comment. Ms. Norville's agent at
William Morris Agency Inc., Jim Griffin, also declined to
comment.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Ebersol, who was brought to NBC News
last July, said he had been contemplating leaving "Today" for
the past month. "I felt strongly that in order to stop the
soap opera, I had to be one who stepped forward and took
responsibility for the events of last fall," he said. "It's
clear from research that the viewers are mad at us."</p>
<p>The decision to add Mr. Garagiola, who hosted "Today" from
1969 to 1973, was discussed a month ago by Mr. Ebersol, Mr.
Gartner and "Today" executive producer Tom Capra, according
to people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Ebersol declined
to comment and Mr. Capra couldn't be reached. Mr. Ebersol
said he hoped the move would give Ms. Norville, whom he
described as a "talented journalist" a chance to grow in the
role.</p>
<p>Mr. Garagiola said he was "thrilled" to be back at the
show. "Those were the happiest days I ever had on TV," he
said. "I'm just glad they thought of me. I feel like the
manager has put me in the lineup."</p>
<p>Both Mr. Gumbel and Ms. Norville have high negative rating
among viewers, according to research by rival CBS Inc. NBC
News hopes to balance the two with Mr. Garagiola.</p>
<p>At NBC News, Mr. Ebersol will serve on a new committee for
program development and be in charge of all news coverage
from the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. NBC has broadcast
rights for the Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>Also added to "Today" were Faith Daniels, co-anchor of
"CBS Morning News," who will be news reader. Katie Couric, an
NBC News correspondent, will be national correspondent for
"Today," based in Washington.</p>
