	<p class="article-leader">A bankruptcy trustee won the right to bring lawsuits
seeking debt payments from former partners of the defunct law
firm Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley,
Myerson & Casey.
   In a hearing in Manhattan's federal bankruptcy court,
bankruptcy trustee Francis Musselman disclosed that dozens of
partners were not cooperating with a plan that both he and
the creditors' committee had agreed could make a reasonable
dent in the law firm's huge debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In response, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Prudence Abram lifted
an injunction protecting those partners from suits, making
them each potentially liable for the entire debt. The judge's
order allows only Mr. Musselman to proceed against the
partners, and the suits he is ready to file will seek at
least $60 million from each of 50 or so former partners.</p>
<p>Finley Kumble, once the nation's fourth-largest law firm,
collapsed in October 1987 under the weight of heavy debts and
clashing egos. Three months later, it was pushed into Chapter
11 bankruptcy-law proceedings by four banks to which the firm
owed $83 million. Of the firm's 700 or so lawyers, 270 were
partners.</p>
<p>On March 30, Mr. Musselman, a partner at the New York law
firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, sent letters to all
former partners informing them about how much they owed in
accordance with a plan designed to tackle the firm's debt.
The plan, the second submitted by Mr. Musselman, set the
partners' debt responsibility at $43.2 million, the trustee
said. An earlier plan, rejected by the creditors' committee,
placed the total at $35 million.</p>
<p>Although claims in excess of $2 billion have been filed
against the firm, duplicate or overstated claims helped to
whittle the debt down to about $120 million, excluding
malpractice claims. To pay off the debt, Mr. Musselman can
draw on accounts receivable, the sale of assets, and solicit
the former partners. From auctions and debt collecting, Mr.
Musselman has amassed about $45 million so far. The
shortfall, $60 million to $70 million, is the responsibility
of the partners, said Albert Togut, counsel for the
creditors' committee.</p>
<p>What the partners were asked to pay in the March 30
letters, said Mr. Togut, was less than what they actually
owe. "The {$43.2 million} is a compromise; it's an inducement
to get the partners' consent to pay a portion," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Musselman said 207 partners, accounting for $24.3
million of the $43.2 million, have written letters accepting
the plan. Twelve others whose portion totals about $704,000
sent letters rejecting the plan. The rest, he said, failed to
respond or didn't agree with the amount cited in the letter.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Judge Abram was apparently outraged at the
lack of consensus in the case and expressed skepticism about
whether the partners could ever agree on any plan. Still, Mr.
Musselman remains optimistic, and he is scheduled to meet
today with several former partners and some partners'
attorneys.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he said lawsuits against 50 or so partners
seeking the total shortfall of at least $60 million from each
are ready to be filed.</p>
