	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- After a three-day run-up, bond prices stumbled
as the falling value of the dollar prompted some foreign
investors to bail out of the market.
   The selling began during overnight trading in Tokyo, where
the Treasury's new benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/4 point, or
$2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The losses were
carried over to London trading where the U.S. long-term bond
suffered further declines. When the market opened for trading
in the U.S., prices of the Treasury's benchmark bond were
already nearly 1/2 point lower, where they remained for much
of the day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"All the action in the market occurred early in the
morning. Activity really trailed off in the afternoon," said
Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers
Hanover Securities Corp.</p>
<p>The bond market sell-off was triggered by a sharp decline
in the value of the dollar against the yen. When the dollar
falls, the value of dollar-denominated securities also
declines, which makes them less attractive to foreign
investors.</p>
<p>In trading, the dollar finished at 151.30 yen in Tokyo,
well below the 153.35 yen there late Monday. The dollar gave
up more ground against the yen in the U.S. and was quoted
late here at about 150.80 yen, down from 152.47 yen late
Monday. Although the dollar rose against the mark, that had
little effect on the market.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark bond, which has risen sharply in
recent sessions, ended about 3/8 point lower. Municipal,
investment-grade corporate and mortgage-backed securities
posted similar declines. But prices of high-yield junk bonds
advanced for the second consecutive day.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said two economic reports released
early yesterday on industrial production and capacity
utilization caused a brief bounce in the market. But it
didn't last very long.</p>
<p>The two economic reports offered fresh evidence that the
economy is weak. Industrial production dropped 0.4% last
month, as U.S. factories, utilities and mines operated at 83%
of their production capacity. Factory output climbed 0.5% in
March, when the operating rate was 83.5%.</p>
<p>A decline in the production of autos was a major factor in
the April decline, but production of lumber products,
computers, nonferrous metals, paper, clothing, textiles and
many other products also dropped from the previous month.</p>
<p>Typically, negative economic news has a positive impact on
the bond market because lower economic growth leads to
speculation that interest rates will eventually move lower.
And when interest rates fall, bond prices rise.</p>
<p>James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc., said the market's inability to
rally after the economic reports came out may mean the market
is "showing signs of fatigue" and that investors believe
bonds have become too pricey.</p>
<p>Others, however, speculate that investors may be reluctant
to buy bonds ahead of today's potentially market-moving
consumer price index report for April. The index is a key
measure of inflation.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
estimate, on average, a 0.3% rise in April's index. A higher
inflation rate could depress the market.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a
price of 101 11/32 to yield 8.65%. The price was down from
101 24/32 to yield 8.58% on Monday. The latest 10-year notes
ended at a price of 101 14/32 to yield 8.64%, compared with
101 22/32 to yield 8.60% on Monday.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were slightly lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at about 7.65% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.89%, down slightly from the
average rate of 7.67% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.93%
set at Monday's Treasury bill auction.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended 2/32 to 5/32 point lower.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
June delivery ended at 95 5/8, down 4/32; 9 1/2% securities
were at 98 1/32, down 2/32; 10% securities were at 100 14/32,
down 5/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2%
securities were at 97 21/32, down 2/32.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.77% to a 12-year
average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury
10-year note narrowed 0.02 percentage point to 1.13.</p>
<p>In the derivative market, Ryland Acceptance Corp. offered
a $315 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed
by Ginnie Mae 10% securities through Kidder, Peabody & Co.
And the Federal National Mortgage Association issued a $190
million Remic backed by its 9 1/2% principal-only strips
through First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Despite the mounting problems in the thrift industry, one
California savings and loan managed to tap the debt market
with a sellout bond issue.</p>
<p>Golden West Financial Corp., considered to be one of the
healthiest and most conservatively run thrifts in the nation,
sold $115 million of subordinated notes. Strong investor
demand prompted underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets to increase the size of the issue from $100 million.</p>
<p>Among other new issues, Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.
and Delta Air Lines offered a total of $450 million of debt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, junk bonds surged for the second straight day
in a broad-based market rally.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings, gained 1/2 to 3/4 point.</p>
<p>Junk dealers said trading volume was the strongest they've
seen in weeks.</p>
<p>Among the bonds that advanced strongly were R.H. Macy &
Co.'s 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in
1998, which added 1 1/2 to end at 73 1/2; Safeway Stores
Inc.'s 12% subordinated debentures, due in 1998, which
chalked up a point to close at 98 3/4; and Duracell Holdings
Corp.'s 13 1/2% subordinated debentures, due in 2000, which
inched up 1/2 point to finish at 103 1/2.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Ames Department Stores Inc. were also
higher. An attorney for the Rocky Hill, Conn.-based retailer
told a bankruptcy court judge that the firm has reached an
agreement in principle with 33 of its pre-bankruptcy lenders.
The judge is expected to issue an order today on Ames's
request for $250 million of interim financing.</p>
<p>Ames's 13% senior subordinated reset notes rose a point to
close at 28, reflecting the market's belief that the firm
will secure interim financing.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, corporate
issues finished unchanged to about 1/8 point lower.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were 1/8 to 3/8 point lower in late
dealings as the tax-exempt market grappled with its first
onslaught of supply in several weeks.</p>
<p>Secondary market dealings were quiet as attention focused
on the new-issue arena, where more than $1 billion of new
debt was priced.</p>
<p>In one of the largest deals of the day, a Chase Securities
Inc. group reported that the account was closed on an issue
of $250 million of Texas National Research Laboratory
Commission's superconducting supercollider project general
obligation bonds priced yesterday.</p>
<p>By comparison, about one-half, or about $33.6 million,
remained from an issue of $72 million of Los Angeles general
obligation bonds won by a Prudential-Bache Capital Funding
group.</p>
<p>"Los Angeles was priced so aggressively. It was priced
through the highest trade we've seen on California GOs," said
one New York serial bond trader.</p>
<p>Prior to the pricing of the Los Angeles bonds, several
traders had suggested that some of the day's deals might come
aggressively priced, with high prices and low yields, because
dealers needed to pick up bonds to fill slim inventories.</p>
<p>Whether dealers will have difficulty moving new bonds will
depend on the consumer price data scheduled for release
today, several traders said.</p>
<p>In negotiated dealings, a Goldman, Sachs & Co. group
priced $166.5 million of New York State Environmental
Facilities Corp.'s state water pollution control revolving
revenue bonds.</p>
<p>In secondary action, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue of 2018 was off 3/8 point at 98 bid to yield 7.35%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Prices of West German government bonds fell as investors
sold bonds on fears that a large supply of new securities
would depress prices.</p>
<p>The government is expected to issue between four billion
and five billion marks (between $2.44 billion and $3.04
billion) of 10-year notes on Friday. Dealers expect the notes
to have a coupon rate of between 8 1/2% and 8 5/8%. That
would be up from a rate of 7 3/4% on the current benchmark
10-year note.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, the benchmark issue fell 0.55 point
to 94.10 to yield 8.66%.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market also was hurt by a newspaper
report that said West Germany may soon issue bonds geared
toward international investors, the proceeds of which would
be used to invest in East Germany. West Germany's finance
ministry denied plans to launch international bonds.</p>
<p>But Bonn and the 11 West German states are planning a 115
billion mark special German Unity Fund financed by credits to
help pay for the reconstruction of East Germany's economy.
The fund would be built up by debt issued in the domestic
capital market.</p>
<p>In Japan, government bonds ended stronger on the yen's
strength. But many traders in Japan don't believe that bond
prices will continue to rise because the market's
fundamentals haven't changed.</p>
<p>"At this point the market is only rising on the yen, not
on short-term interest rates," said a trader at one of
Japan's large brokerage firms.</p>
<p>Rates on new three-month certificates of deposit were
unchanged at 7.36%, and Japanese analysts don't expect
short-term rates to drop much. Therefore, it will be
difficult for the Japanese bond market rally to continue,
they said.</p>
<p>At the Tokyo Stock Exchange close, Japan's benchmark
10-year issue was quoted at 88.13, up 0.44 point, to yield
6.93%.</p>
