	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Mobil Corp. is preparing to take back and
recycle those flimsy plastic grocery bags flooding many
American homes, largely in hopes of staving off legislation
to limit their use.
   The oil company, the nation's second-largest maker of the
bags, is expected to announce today a national recycling
effort that will begin at 244 Safeway Stores in California,
Nevada and Hawaii. Mobil is busy wooing other grocery-store
chains, which each year use more than 12 billion of the thin
plastic bags nationwide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mobil plans to tout its program as the first national
effort to recycle such bags, but will probably run into an
immediate challenge from its chief rival as to which company
became environmentally conscious first.</p>
<p>Sonoco Products Co., the nation's largest manufacturer of
plastic grocery sacks, said yesterday that it has already
initiated bag-recycling programs at 1,500 locations in the
U.S., though it hasn't made any public announcement.</p>
<p>"We're in almost every major part of the country," said
company spokesman Richard Puffer. He conceded, however, that
Sonoco can't turn the old bags into new ones like Mobil can.
Instead, Sonoco sells the bags it collects to another
company, which makes plastic tubing.</p>
<p>Regardless of which company is leading this recycling
race, officials for both companies agree that environmentally
conscious consumers and legislators have yet to be convinced
of the value of the plastic bags, which have been replacing
old-fashioned brown paper grocery sacks.</p>
<p>Plastic bags, as well as plastic containers and bottles,
have been coming under increasing fire from environmentalists
who claim that they're a blight on the land because they
aren't biodegradable. Paper is better, they say. Consumers
also are beginning to ask for paper bags, said Jean Statler
of the Council for Solid Waste Solutions, which is based in
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, plastic bags now make up 60% of all bags
used in grocery stores, a huge jump from 5% in 1982. They
have been welcomed by shopkeepers because they cost half as
much as paper bags and take up 70% less storage space.</p>
<p>There's also a strong case to be made that paper bags
don't decay very quickly, because current landfills are
sealed and thus lack the microbial activity necessary to
promote decay. But that argument has fallen on deaf ears so
far.</p>
<p>Currently, there are several hundred legislative proposals
pending at the municipal level calling for a ban on plastic
bags. Moreover, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
said that consumers must somehow cut back on the amount of
trash being crammed into already-strained landfills.</p>
<p>"Consumer awareness has grown in the last six months, and
we must have an environmentally acceptable product," said
Allen Gray, a Mobil official familiar with the bag-recycling
program. "It's an important marketing tool."</p>
<p>Recycling also will give Mobil free plastic to turn into
still more plastic bags. Between 15% and 40% of its consumer
bags are already made of recycled material, but Mobil
currently buys that plastic from other companies.</p>
<p>During a pilot program in a grocery-store chain here, it
found that shoppers brought back 20% to 25% of Mobil's bags.
If the nationwide program takes hold, "that would be more
than one billion bags," says Greg Auth, Mobil's business
manager of grocery sacks, explaining that the company makes
more than five billion bags annually.</p>
<p>But picking up public good will is probably just as high
on Mobil's list as picking up free plastic. Less than two
months ago, the oil giant was pressured into withdrawing a
claim that its widely used "Hefty" trash bags were
biodegradable after the claim was challenged by attorneys
general of eight states.</p>
<p>In the wake of the flap, the company plans to get its
grocery-bag recycling program in motion soon, though "we need
a little lead time to get the {collection} bins ready," Mr.
Auth explains.</p>
<p>Mobil said that its four polyethylene-products plants have
the technology and equipment to recycle plastic sacks. It
already processes its own plastic scrap in addition to scrap
purchased from outside producers.</p>
<p>Sonoco said it's trying to recycle scrap, too. It reclaims
the plastic scrap created when it punches handles into its
bags, much the way donut shops recycle their donut holes into
separate munchables.</p>
<p>Although it means more work for their personnel, grocery
stores are expected to sign on to the recycling campaigns.
Consumers are starting to blame stores and outlets for using
packaging deemed environmentally unacceptable. Explained the
Council's Ms. Statler: "McDonald's has been taking the heat
over its packaging," even though it doesn't make the
offending plastic hamburger containers. As a result, the
burger-giant is starting its own recycling program, setting
up bins at its outlets to collect the plastic packaging, she
said.</p>
<p>The fate of grocery-bag recycling will depend largely on
the consumer, officials for both Mobil and Sonoco said. Will
the shoppers return enough bags to make the program
economically feasible? What shape will the bags be in? The
dirtier they are, the higher the processing costs. Sonoco's
Mr. Puffer is especially leery. "We found a plastic shower
curtain in one of our bins," he said.</p>
