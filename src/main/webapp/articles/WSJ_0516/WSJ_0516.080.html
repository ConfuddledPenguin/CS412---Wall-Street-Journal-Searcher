	<div class="article-body"><p>You never know when your aging dog will need an orthopedic
pet bed. But when canine arthritis does strike, the affluent
have always known where to shop: Hammacher Schlemmer & Co.</p>
<p>Of late, however, Hammacher's fortress position in the
marketplace for expensive, often gimmicky, items is beginning
to look a bit like a Maginot line as competitors outflank it.
In 67 cities so far, entrepreneur Richard Thalheimer's
Sharper Image Corp. especially has eaten into Hammacher's
position.</p>
<p>Hammacher's annual sales -- an undisclosed figure -- are
probably around $50 million, some industry executives say.
But Sharper Image reported revenue of $208.6 million for the
fiscal year ended Jan. 31. Sharper Image employs 1,200
people, 10 times as many as Hammacher.</p>
<p>"Hammacher had a shot at becoming the company that Sharper
Image now is but blew it," says Alan Millstein, editor of a
New York newsletter named Fashion Network Report.</p>
<p>A look at Hammacher shows that even fortresses can be
vulnerable. But Hammacher is trying to strengthen its
position. "The company is like this gem that was allowed to
get dusty," says John Semmelhack, president of Hammacher
since March 1989. "Now we're polishing it up."</p>
<p>Mr. Semmelhack says Hammacher has gotten better results
lately, mostly by stressing mail-order sales through a
slicker catalog. He says overall sales rose 20% last year, a
pace he expects to continue this year and next. (As for
profit or loss, he says only that "profitability is
improving.") The company also is stressing less gimmicky
products and is shifting its target to middlebrow consumers.</p>
<p>Founded in 1848, Hammacher Schlemmer gained national fame
for such exotic luxury items as a $450 set of ski helmets
with built-in two-way radios and a $1,299 motorized golf bag
that propels itself.</p>
<p>Rover's bed with a specially designed orthopedic foam
cushion sells for $47. For those who hate to endlessly
reposition their beach chairs to track the sun, Hammacher
offers a $74 folding beach chair that revolves 360 degrees.
For $25, it has a battery-powered nose-hair trimmer that it
claims is the best in the business. The company was an early
seller of the pop-up toaster, the electric dry shaver, the
automatic steam iron, the electric toothbrush and the
cordless telephone.</p>
<p>The company's flagship New York store, situated on East
57th Street since 1926, has inspired New Yorker magazine
cartoons. It also inspired a Broadway song, "Hammacher
Schlemmer, I Love You," from "The Little Show" of 1929.</p>
<p>The regular customers have included movie stars,
presidents and foreign dignitaries. "The store is great for
taking out-of-town relatives into -- it's an archetypical New
York experience," says David J. Kaufmann, a Manhattan lawyer.</p>
<p>While it sold toys for adults, Hammacher for many years
was itself a toy for a succession of rich but complacent
owners, Mr. Millstein says. Tim Simon, president of a San
Francisco manufacturer of gift items, says Sharper Image
aggressively created a national market for products similar
to Hammacher's while Hammacher seemed content to serve a much
smaller audience, mostly in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Though Hammacher's New York store has shrunk to a single
sales floor from as many as seven in the past, it has
survived. Hammacher also runs two smaller stores, in Chicago
-- where it is now based -- and Beverly Hills, Calif. A
nationwide mail-order business accounts for 75% of sales.</p>
<p>Many of the 800 items at the New York store are gimmicky
or even wacky; some are difficult or impossible to find
elsewhere. In recent years, Hammacher has offered bowling
lanes and used London taxicabs. Besides unusual gadgets,
Hammacher offers a broad range of housewares, sporting goods,
personal-care products, electronics and soft goods.</p>
<p>The store isn't for cheapskates. Even Mr. Kaufmann, the
lawyer who likes taking visitors to Hammacher, says, "I keep
purchases to a minimum -- it's a fairly pricey store."
Morocco's King Hassan once requested a discount on $28,000 in
purchases, including a half-scale copy of a Model T Ford --
and was refused.</p>
<p>The company, which began as William Tollner's hardware
store, has long catered to the affluent. (The name "Hammacher
Schlemmer" came along in 1883, reflecting the names of the
owners at the time.) In 1899, when only a few hundred wealthy
people in New York owned cars, Hammacher began selling auto
parts. After several shifts in direction, it switched its
major focus in 1955 to luxury gift items.</p>
<p>Yet in recent years, as consumer gadgetry boomed,
Hammacher missed chances to grow. "We weren't aggressively
managing the company for expansion -- it wasn't our primary
business interest," says New York investor Norman M.
Hinerfeld, part of a group that owned Hammacher in the early
70s. Hammacher had an even lower priority with its next
owner, huge Gulf & Western Industries (now Paramount
Communications Inc.). In 1980, G&W sold Hammacher to J.
Roderick MacArthur, an heir to the insurance fortune behind
the foundation known for generous awards to gifted
individuals. After Mr. MacArthur died in 1984, his heirs
became the owners.</p>
<p>While Hammacher drifted, Sharper Image gained ground. For
example, both companies bought the same product, a
sound-actuated light switch, from Mr. Simon in the early 80s.
Sharper Image, thanks to a harder sell in a much flashier
catalog, sold 300,000 units, while Hammacher moved only
1,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Simon says Mr. Thalheimer consistently is more
aggressive than Hammacher at commissioning exclusive products
and at making commitments for large purchases even when
products are still in the concept stage.</p>
<p>Hammacher has become a bit less gimmicky, dropping the
radio-equipped ski helmets, for example. Mr. Semmelhack
explains, "You can get so unique that you don't have a
market." In its window display, the New York store now
stresses traditional low-tech products, such as a child's
wagon and an English bicycle.</p>
<p>Middlebrow consumers, not rich eccentrics, increasingly
are Hammacher's target. Thus, its catalogs are placing more
emphasis on the findings of Hammacher Schlemmer Institute,
the company's quasi-independent advisory arm since 1984. On
the basis of comparison tests, Hammacher avers that many of
its wares are the "best" in their categories. Sami Ozgen,
research manager, says Hammacher's cordless telephone
defeated 10 others in tests for sound quality and range.</p>
<p>Hammacher plans to remodel its flagship store, which Mr.
Semmelhack sees as the base for building a stronger company.
If the MacArthur family -- distant relatives of the late Gen.
Douglas MacArthur -- succeeds in its strategy, the old
fortress won't ever fade away.</p>
