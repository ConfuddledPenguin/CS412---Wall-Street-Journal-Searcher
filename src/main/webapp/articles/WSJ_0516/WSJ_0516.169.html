	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The yen racked up further gains against the
dollar and the mark as the Japanese unit capitalized on
market uncertainty surrounding the direction of the U.S.
economy and German political developments.
   The U.S. unit fell almost two yen on worries about recent
mixed signals on the U.S. economy and nervousness about the
possibility of lower interest rates, traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lingering worry over the effect of losses by West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in Sunday's
state elections caused selling of the mark, especially
against the resurgent yen, they said.</p>
<p>The yen was helped in its rise against the dollar, mark
and other major currencies by fading concern about the
Japanese stock market as Japanese share prices generally
recover, said Gabriel Grippo, senior foreign exchange trader
at Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York.</p>
<p>Traders said that turmoil in the Japanese stock market,
now receded, was seen as the most important factor blocking
an increase in Japanese interest rates by the Bank of Japan,
a step that could strengthen the yen. They noted, however,
that with the yen on the rise, such an increase may not be
necessary.</p>
<p>The Nikkei stock index finished Tuesday in Tokyo at
31,997.04 points, down a slight 45.61 points on late
profit-taking. The index rose 530.51 points Monday and 531.88
points Friday.</p>
<p>Interest-rate concerns are now weakening the dollar, as
participants try to gauge which way the U.S. economy is
headed, Mr. Grippo and other participants agreed.</p>
<p>The market's interest in today's Consumer Price Index
figure for April stems from the focus on interest rates, they
said.</p>
<p>Although most participants believe the Federal Reserve
will maintain a neutral stance on interest rates for the time
being, the CPI is being watched for any sign that pressure
for lower rates might be building. For that reason, it's
anticipated that a lower-than-expected CPI number would hurt
the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>In the general view of traders, the U.S. economy offers
the status quo, while both the West German and Japanese
central banks promise change. "There's a conviction that the
Bundesbank will tighten some time soon," said J. Paul Horne,
international economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham in
Paris. "And we think the Bank of Japan has got to tighten,
too."</p>
<p>That expectation is beginning to clear the air after a
period of uncertainty over the Japanese currency. In the past
three weeks, investors in yen-based bonds have fared well.
"Most of the flows have been going into the yen," said George
Magnus, economist with S.G. Warburg Securities in London.
"And it's not sure that move is over."</p>
<p>Sales of the mark against the Japanese unit were
responsible in large part for a modest rise by the dollar
against the West German currency, said Erik Lehtis, senior
dealer at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in New York.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6465 marks, up from 1.6425 marks late Monday, and at
150.80 yen, down from 152.47 yen late Monday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6740, down from $1.6825 Monday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 152.05 yen, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 151.30
yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6480 marks.</p>
<p>"The (West German) election news inspired a lot of
profit-taking," Mr. Lehtis said, noting that the mark's
recent peak around 96 yen had left the West German currency
vulnerable to a correction on technical grounds.</p>
<p>The West German unit ended the New York day around 91.61
yen, off from 92.83 yen late in New York Monday.</p>
<p>The mark was also hurt by a denial by West German monetary
authorities early in the day of a published report that the
Bundesbank might issue mark-denominated bonds to help finance
unification.</p>
<p>The issue of such bonds by the central bank would have
been positive for the mark because of the added funds they
would have generated for the West German government during
unification, traders said. The denial of plans for an issue
depressed the mark a bit by removing a potential source of
strength for the currency, they said.</p>
<p>Dealers' long-term mark bullishness remained unshaken
however, with some crediting a statement by Mr. Kohl late in
the European day favoring an all-German election "at the
earliest possible date" with limiting the mark's losses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most traders remain confident that German
unification plans will bring about a high-interest-rate
stance from the Bundesbank. "A strong Deutsche mark --
perhaps heading toward parity against the U.S. dollar in the
mid-1990s -- will take the inflationary sting out of high
East German growth," said Shearson Lehman Hutton in a recent
report. "But to ensure the Deutsche mark rises, the
Bundesbank will need to keep real interest rates very high."</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370.90 an ounce, up $2.50. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $370.50 an
ounce.</p>
