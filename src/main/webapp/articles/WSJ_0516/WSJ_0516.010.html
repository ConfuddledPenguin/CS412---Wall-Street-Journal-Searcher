	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Precision Castparts Corp., a Portland, Ore.,
metal castings maker, agreed to pay $3.5 million in back pay
to settle Labor Department sex-discrimination charges.
   The amount is one of the largest equal employment
opportunity settlements in the department's history, its
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs said. The
office had charged the company with putting about 1,000 newly
hired women into certain low-pay mold-casting production jobs
usually held by women.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those jobs also provided less opportunity for the women to
compete or train for higher paying jobs usually held by men
at three company plants, the compliance office said.</p>
<p>Precision Castparts agreed to the settlement without
admitting or denying wrongdoing. The company will provide
back pay to about 1,000 current and former female employees
who were employed for at least three consecutive quarters
between 1978 and 1988 at one of the three plants.</p>
<p>The company also agreed to create an affirmative-action
program for the plants to encourage women to compete for
higher paying jobs that are usually held by men. Female
workers will be permitted to seek such jobs, and when they
meet minimum qualifications, including seniority, they must
be given preference for those jobs over male applicants.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the women also will be allowed to
transfer back to their previous jobs if the new ones don't
work out. Also, each woman in a traditional female job who is
paid on an hourly basis will be offered career counseling.
And the performance review of their supervisors will include
how those managers carry out their equal employment
opportunity responsibilities.</p>
<p>In Portland, a Precision Castparts spokesman said in the
10 years it took to negotiate a settlement the company had
implemented a number of equal opportunity and affirmative
action programs for women. "In the intervening period, we
think we've done quite a few things to improve our position
with respect to employing women," the spokesman said.</p>
