	<p class="article-leader">The very brief news item from Reuters, datelined London,
May 11, was headlined "Inflation Spurt in Britain." The
story, in toto, read as follows:
   "Britain's annualized inflation rate leaped sharply to an
eight-year high of 9.4 per cent in April from 8.1 per cent in
March. Inflation last reached 9.4 per cent in April 1982, and
has climbed to its current level from a low of 3.3 per cent
in January 1988. The main components in the latest rise were
the introduction of a poll tax to finance local governments
and the increase in duties on alcohol, tobacco, and
gasoline."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This report jogged my memory. Almost a decade ago,
Margaret Thatcher radically increased Britain's value-added
tax (VAT) -- in effect, a sales tax -- while cutting
income-tax rates. Inflation, as officially measured by the
consumer price index, immediately took a huge leap upward.
Government spending on inflation-indexed welfare programs
also jumped, as did the costs embedded in many private
contracts, while the trade unions promptly demanded (and
often got) compensatory wage increases.</p>
<p>I remember thinking at the time that this made no economic
sense whatsoever. Now, reading the latest Reuters report, I
come to the firm conclusion that it still makes no economic
sense whatsoever. After all, why should an increase (or
decrease) in a sales tax or excise tax be inflationary (or
deflationary), while a comparable increase (or decrease) in
the income tax is not? Why should a poll tax be inflationary
while the property tax, which it replaced, was not? Why
should my office rent go up -- there is an indexation clause
in the lease -- if the government should decide to increase
taxes on alcohol and cigarettes?</p>
<p>How is it possible for any tax increase to be
inflationary? After all, what a tax does is take money from
the private sector and transfer it to the government's
treasury. Why do we think that such a money transfer can be
inflationary?</p>
<p>The answer is that we have forgotten the basics, as taught
in Economics 101. Inflation, we learn from the prescribed
elementary textbook, is a monetary phenomenon. It occurs when
too much money is chasing too few goods. And it is certainly
the case that when too much money is chasing too few goods,
we get a rising price level. But it is an error in logic to
reason backward and to assert that a rising price level
always signals inflation -- i.e., that too much money is
chasing too few goods. To the degree that we ignore the cause
of a rise in the price level, we will be misled into
misguided policies (such as indexation) or an erroneous
monetary policy.</p>
<p>Practically all our economists work from oversimplified
models that assume that the price level, as measured by the
consumer price index (CPI) or producer price index (PPI),
accurately mirrors the state of inflation flowing from the
government's monetary and fiscal policy. This assumption can
lead, and has led, to dangerous absurdities.</p>
<p>Recall the following actual case. Back in the early 1970s,
the OPEC cartel sharply raised the price of oil, thereby in
effect imposing an energy tax on the American people. Since
the costs of energy flow through the entire economy, the
price level, as measured by the conventional indexes, rose
sharply. It seemed -- and was said as well as believed --
that we were experiencing inflation, as a result of which
Richard Nixon was persuaded to commit the economic folly of
imposing wage and price controls. But, of course, what we
were experiencing was not inflation at all but a case of
instant relative impoverishment. The OPEC tax resulted in all
of us having too little money to purchase the "normal" basket
of goods represented by the CPI.</p>
<p>It is certainly correct to think, as classical economics
asserts, that over time people would adjust to the new
economic reality. Having to pay more for energy meant that
they would consume less of it, and would -- at least for a
while -- have to consume less of other things as well. This
is precisely what happened -- over time. But the adjustment
process does take time, since people don't instantaneously
revise their living patterns and spending habits. They are
likely to react to this kind of economic "shock" by saving
less, dipping into past savings, and borrowing more.</p>
<p>So for several years, "inflation" was with us, only it
wasn't inflation at all. Nevertheless, indexation -- whether
contractual or informal -- could make that increase in the
price level permanent. Central banks, in a modern democracy,
have little stomach for a painful deflation of the price
level.</p>
<p>A similar situation could easily arise from other shocks,
whether "acts of God" or of man. The price level may well be
an adequate proxy for inflation over very long periods of
time. To look at the CPI or the PPI every month, as we now
do, and to try to draw conclusions about the value of 30-year
Treasury bonds, is ridiculous. Nevertheless, our economists
-- most of them, anyhow -- are busily engaged in this
exercise, and the financial markets, having no mind of their
own on this complex issue, tend to follow suit. For the
central bank to jiggle short-term interest rates in the light
of these monthly numbers is equally ridiculous. We are
fortunate that Alan Greenspan thinks so too.</p>
<p>What makes the whole business even more absurd, in fact as
well as theory, is that the consumer price index is revised,
and its "representative" basket of goods made current, only
intermittently over the decade. It is common for years to
pass before the Bureau of Labor Statistics can get around to
bringing us up to date on how we are distributing our
purchasing power among available goods and services, and how
much we are spending on the total. The price level the CPI
reports always lags well behind the reality. This would not
be so important were it not for the fact that the CPI is
reported in tenths of one percent, and these small variations
in an anachronistic set of monthly statistics are seized upon
by commentators and analysts as possibly signifying a trend.</p>
<p>It would be very helpful if our economists could come up
with some way of looking at inflation, thinking about
inflation, and roughly measuring inflation (with no attempt
at false precision) that was not linked to the current level
of prices. The monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, have made
a truly noble effort to decouple inflation from
contemporaneous perturbations in the price level, but
"monetarism," when put into practice, has run into serious
difficulties. In an economy with a fiat currency, where
credit is also "money," and where computers can finance
transactions by accelerating the "velocity" of money, the
concept of the "money supply" is slippery and amorphous.
Though still a powerful conceptual tool, it seems to be most
useful in retrospective explanations covering long periods of
time.</p>
<p>Perhaps, one of these days, our monetarists -- I see them
as our only hope -- will come up with a new and superior
methodology. Until then, we would be well advised to look
with skepticism at all those statistics about prices and
"inflation" that constitute our daily economic news. And we
would be well advised, too, to try to cure ourselves of the
mischievous habit of indexing wages, prices, pensions, taxes,
etc. to relatively short-term changes in the price level.</p>
