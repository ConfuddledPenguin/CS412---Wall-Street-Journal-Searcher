	<p class="article-leader">Trans World Airlines reported a first-quarter net loss of
$143 million, significantly wider than the $83.1 million net
loss a year earlier.
   The financially troubled company, which Chairman Carl
Icahn took private in 1988, said that revenue rose 2.5% to
$1.01 billion from $989.7 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It said operating expenses rose more sharply. Costs rose
by 9.3% to $1.1 billion from $1.02 billion during the
year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p>The Mount Kisco, N.Y., company attributed most of the jump
to a 35.7% rise in the price of jet fuel. It said the average
jet fuel price rose to 73.7 cents a gallon from 54.3 cents a
gallon during the first quarter of 1989. TWA said the
increase cost the company an additional $52.9 million in fuel
expenses compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>It said the remaining $41.9 million jump in expenses was
related to increased capacity and service changes.</p>
