	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Degussa AG and E. Merck said
they have abandoned their plan to merge their pharmaceutical
divisions, citing a lack of common interests.
   The two West German chemicals groups said a study by a
joint expert commission has shown that "the common interests
for a cooperation weren't sufficient."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The talks were subsequently terminated," Degussa and
Merck said in a statement.</p>
<p>In late 1989, Degussa approached Merck with the proposal
to merge its Asta Pharma AG drug subsidiary with the much
larger pharmaceutical division of Merck and take a minority
stake in the joint venture.</p>
<p>Merck, which is closely held, isn't affiliated with Merck
& Co. of the U.S.</p>
<p>Details on the talks were first disclosed in February, and
at a news conference in March, Degussa Chairman Gert Becker
still expressed optimism that the negotations would succeed.</p>
<p>But Hans-Werner Hauck, Merck's finance chief, said the
concept proposed by Degussa wasn't in the best interest of
Merck. "Degussa wanted to sell its division and still have a
say in it, but this is a difficult construction," he said.</p>
<p>A Degussa spokesman declined to give any reasons for the
failure of the talks.</p>
