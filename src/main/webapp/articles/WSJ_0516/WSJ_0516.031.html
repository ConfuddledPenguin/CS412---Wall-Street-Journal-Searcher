	<p class="article-leader">Plutarch reports that she wasn't particularly pretty but
had a good personality. Others have insisted the reverse was
true. Cleopatra is certainly a woman worth following through
legend's hall of mirrors, as Lucy Hughes-Hallett
entertainingly demonstrates in "Cleopatra: Histories, Dreams
and Distortions" (Harper & Row, 338 pages, $27.50). Written
in the tradition of Marina Warner's studies of the Virgin
Mary and Joan of Arc, "Cleopatra" takes a critical look at
the cultural metamorphoses of an important woman.
Quicksilvery Cleopatra (69 to 30 B.C.) has been used to
reflect cultural values in story and image for two millennia.
   But before the legend there was the life, and a busy one
it was. She was the last of a Greek dynasty imposed on Egypt
by Alexander the Great's general Ptolemy I in 305 B.C. Her
father, Ptolemy XII the Flute-Player, left her the throne
when she was 18 years old to rule Egypt jointly with her
10-year-old husband-brother Ptolemy XIII. (Brother-sister
marriages were a habit the Ptolemies picked up from the
earlier, native Pharaohs.) Ptolemy XIII soon turned up
drowned, after Cleo took up with the Roman conqueror Julius
Caesar, perhaps the first man she'd met not a sibling or a
eunuch. But Caesar wouldn't marry her, forcing her instead to
wed another brother, 12-year-old Ptolemy XIV.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After a brief sojourn in Rome that ended with Caesar's
murder, Cleopatra returned to Egypt, where Ptolemy XIV died.
Civil war followed, this time featuring Cleo and her new
Roman lover, the warlord Mark Antony, vs. Caesar's
grand-nephew Octavian (later Emperor Augustus). Defeated by
Octavian at Actium, Antony fell on his sword. Whether
Cleopatra reached for an asp is actually uncertain, and
perhaps a misinterpretation of a snake bracelet adorning the
dead queen.</p>
<p>Certainly male Roman poets wasted no time turning the
enemy queen into a "barbaric voluptuary." Virgil in his
"Aeneid" presented her in the guise of Dido, a clinging
African queen who nearly sidetracked Aeneas from the founding
of Rome. Horace called her a "monster" and Propertius a
"royal prostitute."</p>
<p>Ms. Hughes-Hallett, a British journalist and television
critic, stresses the one-sidedness of these Roman views of
Cleopatra as a seductress out to topple aqueducts and
legionaries with orgies and banquets. Set on a feminist
deconstruction of male views of Cleopatra, the book sees the
queen as a capable ruler, a woman of political and military
savvy, and a shrewd manipulator of her own public image who
liked to present herself as snake-loving Isis, the supreme
Egyptian Mother Goddess ruling in cosmic harmony with "King"
Antony as her consort Osiris. Although the author concedes
the equally partial nature of her dream Cleopatra --
androgynous, pacific and racially tolerant, at war with a
patriarchal, bellicose and racist Rome -- she goes on to
judge later Cleopatras in the light of it.</p>
<p>The Cleos of the middle ages are skimpy: Dante, for
example, puts her in Hell and dismisses her with one word,
"luxurious." It is in the Renaissance, specifically in
Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra," that Cleo attains major
legendary status. Ms. Hughes-Hallett admires the play, but
chafes a bit at its erotic heat, saying, "The Alexandria of
this play is a cramped and enervating place, a gilded cage.
The real Cleopatra's court must have been a bustling place,
the centre of an elaborate and efficient bureaucracy, and the
real Cleopatra, scholar and administrator, would have had
little time for mooning over love letters." What a prosaic
and dreary revisionist prospect: Cleopatra as Mrs. Thatcher]</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century Cleos were stiffly regal, but exotic.
"Oriental" versions blossomed in the next century, both in
literature and in painting (which Ms. Hughes-Hallett also
treats at length). In a Pushkin story she is an Asiatic
nymphomaniac, whose young lovers must die after a single
night of bliss; in Rider Haggard's novel "Cleopatra," she is
a jewel-hungry mummy robber; Sardou's play was a lurid
vehicle for Sarah Bernhardt, a performance of which in
Victoria's London provoked the famous remark: "How unlike the
home life of our own dear queen."</p>
<p>This century's Cleos have largely been cinematic. Ms.
Hughes-Hallett dwells attentively on such films as the 1934
DeMille art-deco "Cleopatra" with Claudette Colbert (happily
seeing this as a triumph of visual wit and not at all
contemptible), the 1945 "Caesar and Cleopatra" (she rejects
the Shaw play's infantilization of the queen but does like
Vivien Leigh), and the 1963 Taylor-Burton bore (she
expatiates far too long and humorlessly on Taylor-Cleo
parallels. "Such futile expenditure is anarchic. It robs
money, the stuff we work so hard to get . . . of its
meaning," she writes, sternly, about Ms. Taylor's Roman
villa, whose tablecloths matched her dresses).</p>
<p>This is a rich and richly illustrated book about an
amazingly durable and fascinating figure. Reading it, one
keeps hoping that its gifted writer will let the evidence
speak for itself before rushing to her all too predictable
judgments on it. Often enough, she does.</p>
