	<p class="article-leader">Daimler-Benz AG predicted further sales growth for 1990 as
it continues its strategy of widespread diversification.
   The Stuttgart, West Germany-based auto, aerospace and
electronics group said first-quarter sales rose to 19.5
billion Deutsche marks ($11.9 billion) from 17 billion marks
in the year-earlier period, reflecting to a major extent the
acquisition last year of aerospace concern
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB). Group sales are
expected to rise to 85 billion marks this year from 76.39
billion marks a year earlier.</p>
