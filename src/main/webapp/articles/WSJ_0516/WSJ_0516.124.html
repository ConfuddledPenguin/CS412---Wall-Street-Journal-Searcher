	<p class="article-leader">A federal trial court struck down the basic patent
covering Gore-Tex, the space-age material that helped W.L.
Gore & Associates Inc. grow from its founders' basement into
a world-wide business.
   The decision casts a cloud over Gore, but the closely held
Newark, Del., concern insists that it will pass. The company
plans to appeal the decision and notes that its products are
covered by other patents as well. But if Gore loses on
appeal, it could face new or heightened competition much
sooner than it has banked on.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gore-Tex owes its existence to a remarkable stroke of
luck: On an impulse in 1969, Robert W. Gore gave a quick jerk
-- rather than a slow pull -- to a plastic rod he was trying
to stretch. The surprising result wasn't a broken rod but a
new material. Gore-Tex is used in a host of applications,
including space suits, medical devices, tents and industrial
filters.</p>
<p>In rejecting Gore's claims of patent infringement against
a maker of vascular grafts, Judge Charles L. Hardy last
Friday essentially ruled Gore's patent invalid. Instead of
losing its basic patent protection upon normal expiration in
three more years, Gore may be without that protection much
sooner.</p>
<p>Mr. Gore's parents founded the company in 1958 in the
basement of their home. After rapid growth during the past
decade, Gore has about 5,000 employees world-wide and its
sales, which aren't disclosed, are believed to top $700
million a year.</p>
<p>Now, at least two companies -- C.R. Bard Inc., Murray
Hill, N.J., and Tetratec Corp., Philadelphia -- say they'll
be prepared to jump into more segments of Gore's market if
Judge Hardy's decision is upheld on appeal. Bard already
produces vascular grafts made from Dacron, a different
material from Gore's. Vascular grafts are used to replace
diseased or damaged human arteries. Tetratec already makes
products similar to some of Gore's; it settled a
patent-infringement suit by Gore out of court last year.</p>
<p>Bard also settled a patent-infringement suit by Gore; the
out-of-court settlement prohibits Bard from using Gore's
material for vascular replacements. Before using the
material, says C.R. Bard Treasurer William Bopp, "We'll
clearly wait until all appeals are exhausted."</p>
<p>For its part, Gore doesn't see a problem. "We don't think
that losing the patent is an immediate threat to our
business," says Iain Campbell, a patent attorney with the
company. Mr. Campbell says additional patents, unaffected by
the court ruling, protect Gore's products. "We won't have a
flood of people coming into the market because they'll still
have to worry about the subsidiary patents," he says.</p>
<p>Gore says it will appeal the lower court decision to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.
The Court of Appeals is something of a specialty court for
patent cases, and the U.S. Supreme Court generally defers to
its expertise. Moreover, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the
Gore patent in a similar case seven years ago.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company has long sailed through storms over
its patent applications and patents. Though Gore made the
lucky discovery in 1969, it wasn't until August 1979 that the
company, on its fourth attempt, obtained a U.S. patent for
its stretched form of polytetrafluoroethylene resin (the
generic name for Teflon). The patent was delayed by, among
other things, questions raised by a 1967 patent issued in
Japan to Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd.</p>
<p>In the latest dispute, Gore sued International Medical
Prosthetics Research Associates Inc., or Impra, an Arizona
company founded by surgeons and researchers affiliated with
Arizona State University and Arizona Heart Institute. Gore
claimed patent infringement, and Impra challenged the patent.</p>
<p>In ruling that Gore's basic patent covering Gore-Tex is
invalid, Judge Hardy rejected the company's original
laboratory test results to support claims that Gore-Tex is
unique. Those results were vague and insufficient for
supporting a patent, he ruled. Patent law requires that an
invention be different from previous ones, so that others can
know what features may be safely used without a license.</p>
<p>The basic Gore patent, among other defects, "does not
specify the appropriate test for measuring tensile strength,"
Judge Hardy ruled in federal court in Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
<p>Gore had sued Impra for $72 million in damages.</p>
<p>Impra's lead attorney, Gerald North of North & Barron,
Phoenix, said he believes the ruling will be upheld. This
case is different from the appeals case won by Gore in 1984,
he says, because Impra had to meet a higher burden of proof
than was required in Gore's 1984 suit against Garlock Inc., a
Rochester, N.Y., manufacturer. Also, Mr. North notes, the
ruling was based on a finding of facts, not an interpretation
of the law. Rulings based on fact are overturned only when
clearly erroneous.</p>
<p>"Impra will compete more vigorously than before," says Mr.
North. "There was growth in revenues during the period the
case was pending, so we expect greater growth."</p>
