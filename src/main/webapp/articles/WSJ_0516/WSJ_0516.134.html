	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index softened Tuesday, finishing
well below its midday high as the yen's slide in late
afternoon spawned profit-taking.
   A slowdown in buying in late afternoon permitted arbitrage
selling to pull down the index, traders said, but the
majority of stocks managed to end the day higher.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London shares ended slightly lower in listless trading.</p>
<p>At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues edged down 45.61
points to close at 31997.04. The move followed a 531.88-point
gain Friday and a 530.51 advance Monday.</p>
<p>The recent climb of the yen and the prospect of lower
interest rates kept sentiment bullish, observers said.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the strength of the yen, an afternoon rally
led by dealers and some investment trust funds pushed up the
Nikkei index as high as 32323 points, absorbing selling
linked to index-futures arbitrage, traders said.</p>
<p>But as the yen fell back to the 151-yen-to-the-dollar
level later, dealers and some other investors quickly took
profits, participants said.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index
eased 56.86 points to 31940.18.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 900
million shares, up from 824 million Monday.</p>
<p>Winners outnumbered losers, 642 to 347, while 139 issues
remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all
issues listed in the first section, which surged 41.35 points
Monday, was up 8.46 points at 2398.78.</p>
<p>The second section index, which rose 25.64 points Monday,
inched up 3.32 points, or 0.09%, to close at 3848.78. Volume
in the section was 18 million shares, remaining at the same
level with Monday.</p>
<p>Market attention is focused on the foreign exchange rates,
which are seen as the key to determining the direction of
domestic interest rates.</p>
<p>Takamori Matsuda, head of research at Dresdner-ABD
Securities, said the recent recovery of the yen against the
dollar stemmed from the U.S. economy's prospects, but added
that it's also a reaction of the foreign exchange market,
which decided the yen's decline to the 160-yen-to-the-dollar
level in April was too extreme.</p>
<p>In the long run, the dollar will be supported against the
yen as capital flow from Japan to foreign nations will
continue, Mr. Matsuda said.</p>
<p>Koji Kamemura, manager of the fund managing division at
Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance, said the dollar is likely to
stabilize in a range between 150 and 155 yen. Domestic
long-term interest rates may turn down to a certain level, he
said. But he suspects that lower long-term rates might not
necessarily pull down short rates.</p>
<p>The rapid move in currency and bond markets is tempting
institutional investors to leave the sidelines, Mr. Kamemura
said. But active institutional buying will be mainly
conducted by institutions with high cash positions, he added.</p>
<p>Recent signs that interest rates may have peaked out
helped push up interest rate-sensitive stocks, such as
construction and housing shares, which had been heavily sold
as rates climbed sharply since the beginning of this year,
traders said.</p>
<p>Outstanding winners Tuesday included Kajima Corp., which
gained 40 yen (26 cents) to 1,820 yen; Daiwa House, which
rose 100 to 2,350, and Misawa Homes, which went up 90 to
2,540.</p>
<p>Nonferrous metal stocks rallied, due mainly to trading by
dealers for their own accounts, participants said. Sumitomo
Metal Mining advanced 60 to 1,600, while Nippon Light Metal
gained 22 to 930.</p>
<p>London shares closed slightly lower, running out of steam
after a strong rally on Monday.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished down just 2.3 points at 2212.2, although above its
intraday low of 2204.1 and slightly below the high of 2216.1,
posted around midday.</p>
<p>The narrower FT 30-share index closed down 1.9 points at
1731.6. Volume was a moderate 402.4 million shares, compared
with the scant 375.1 million on Monday.</p>
<p>In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index closed at
2246, down from 2252.</p>
<p>With movement in London shares closely tied to Wall
Street's performance, a weak opening in New York didn't leave
much room for gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Although there were indications earlier in the day that
London might be consolidating from its 38.6-point advance
Monday before moving higher, dealers turned skeptical by the
end of the session on the market's upside potential.</p>
<p>"The market is tired," said one trader. "It's had a big
rally up and there's nothing behind it," he added.</p>
<p>Amid fundamentally bearish tidings for the U.K. economy
and uncertainty about the economic direction of the U.S.,
dealers said they see no good reason for players to pile into
the London market now.</p>
<p>Traders said shares might experience limited upward
movement in the short term because of a shortage of stock and
a need among bears to cover short positions. But a dealer
said "you can't change your mind overnight" about the wisdom
of committing to fresh positions with a grim overall economic
climate.</p>
<p>Several bullish corporate results hit the market, with
drinks concern Allied-Lyons posting the day's strongest gains
after a 12% rise in pretax earnings for the year ended March
3 brought them in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>A bullish outlook for the future helped push the company's
shares up 15 pence (25 cents) to 453 pence. Whitbread rose in
sympathy, adding 7 to 399.</p>
<p>Food retailer Sainsbury added 3 to 260 on the back of a
20% rise in pretax profit for the year, far outstripping
market expectations.</p>
<p>Industrial conglomerate Hanson was unchanged at 226 1/2,
after coming out with interim results showing pretax profit
at the high end of market forecasts.</p>
<p>Food and drinks company Grand Metropolitan lost 4 to 587
over investor worries that interim results scheduled for
release today might be poor, dealers said.</p>
<p>Brewer Bass fell 9 to 988 after announcing the sale of its
Crest hotel chain to Trusthouse Forte for #300 million ($504
million) in cash, a figure slightly below analysts'
expectations. Trusthouse Forte finished the day up 2 to 259.</p>
<p>Stock prices closed higher in Amsterdam, Brussels and
Milan and lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich and Stockholm.
South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore
and Seoul and higher in Taiwan and Wellington; Manila shares
ended little changed.</p>
