	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A Chicago Board of Trade member paid $250,000
to settle Commodity Futures Trading Commission charges that
he made a series of noncompetitive trades in 1986.
   Without admitting or denying the commission's allegations,
Keith M. Rudman, a trader in the exchange's Treasury bond
futures pit, agreed to the fine and a six-month trading
suspension. Mr. Rudman couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Rudman was one of 22 Treasury bond traders charged
last year with making noncompetitive trades via a practice
known as "ginzy trading." The remaining 21 traders are the
subject of a commission hearing here this week concerning the
allegations.</p>
<p>Mr. Rudman was fined $25,000 by the commission for similar
alleged violations in 1985 and was ordered to cease and
desist from making noncompetitive trades.</p>
<p>In ginzy trading, exchange members profit by giving
customers two different prices for the same buy or sell
order. The effect of ginzy trading is to give a customer a
net price for a trade that falls between the quoted bid and
ask prices in a particular market.</p>
<p>While some traders say the technique can result in the
customer getting a better price than under normal trading
practices, the commission maintains that ginzy trading
violates federal commodity laws banning noncompetitive or
prearranged trades.</p>
