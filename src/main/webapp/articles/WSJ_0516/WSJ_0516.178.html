	<p class="article-leader">Circle K Corp., the nation's second-largest convenience
store chain, filed for bankruptcy court protection last night
after failing to get creditors to agree to a restructuring of
its $1.1 billion in high-yield, below-investment-grade "junk"
debt.
   Circle K President Robert A. Dearth Jr. told Circle K
employees that management will continue to run the chain,
based in Phoenix, Ariz., and that it is contacting key
vendors, seeking their cooperation to keep stores stocked.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The filing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
marks the end of a hard-fought battle by William Franke and
other outside directors to win lender approval of a plan to
avoid a bankruptcy-law filing. The efforts were supported by
Circle K's largest shareholder, the Cincinnati investor Carl
Lindner, whose American Financial Corp. holds 38% of the
stock and is a large Circle K creditor. The moves were aimed
at gaining enough time to sell assets, generate cash, and
design a new competitive plan.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company last month averted a default on its
debt by signing a preliminary accord with senior creditors
and Mr. Lindner that provided a seven-month moratorium on
debt and interest payments. And earlier this month, Circle
K's widely criticized chairman, Karl Eller, resigned.</p>
