	<p class="article-leader">Charter Medical Corp. reported its biggest quarterly loss
since going private in a 1988 buy-out, raising concern on
Wall Street about the company's ability to service its debts.
   For the second quarter ended March 31, Charter posted a
$67 million loss on revenue of $475.2 million. The year
earlier, the psychiatric-care company based in Macon, Ga.,
had a $14.6 million loss on revenue of $397.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Part of Charter's latest loss reflected a wider than
expected $35 million pretax charge for "inaccurate recording
of previously reported contractual allowances, bad debts and
expense accruals." The company had estimated in March that it
would take a $28 million charge for the accounting problems.
For the March quarter, Charter also incurred $11.2 million in
pretax charges for canceled development projects and a lost
lawsuit.</p>
<p>Charter's chief financial officer, C. Michael Ford, said
the company has already taken steps, including cutbacks in
capital-spending and cost-cutting programs, to "protect
bondholders and employees." He declined to say whether any
managers or employees had been dismissed in connection with
the accounting problems. In the long term, Mr. Ford said, "We
think Charter is viable, and we can meet our debt-service
requirements and continue to operate the company."</p>
<p>But some Wall Street analysts said Charter's basic
business -- separate from the write-offs -- appeared to
suffer in the latest quarter. "Their cash flow as a
percentage of revenue dropped to 15.8% from 26.3%," said
Meredith Adler, an analyst at First Boston Corp. "That's
disappointing." Ms. Adler said Charter faced pressure on the
average length of patient stay, and on its adolescent-care
business.</p>
<p>Charter's business slump intensified worries about the
company's ability to handle its $1.5 billion in long-term
debt. The company's 14% senior subordinated bonds, which had
traded at 70 cents on the dollar in March, were quoted
yesterday at 48 cents to 50 cents on the dollar. Other,
pay-in-kind bonds were quoted as low as 23 cents on the
dollar yesterday.</p>
<p>"Charter could face significant cash-flow shortfalls over
the next five years," analyst Roger Gordon of Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. warned. "The company could
be forced to restructure its long-term debt." Mitch Bartlett,
an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., also predicted that
Charter's latest results "spell a restructuring for the
company."</p>
<p>Charter, however, asserted that it can pull through. Mr.
Ford said the company has reduced planned capital
expenditures for the year to $140 million from $200 million.
That, he said, combined with cost reductions in, among other
areas, marketing and advertising programs, should enable
Charter to meet its debt payments and still complete
construction of four additional psychiatric hospitals in the
next nine months or so.</p>
<p>"We don't anticipate having to restructure debt," Mr. Ford
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford acknowledged that insurance companies and other
payers of medical bills are increasing pressure on healthcare
providers -- particularly providers of psychiatric care -- to
reduce the length of patient stays and to cut bills. But that
pressure, he said, has been offset at Charter by an increase
in patient admissions -- up 20% in the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>Charter had been advised in its 1988 buy-out by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., which also underwrote high-risk,
high-yield "junk" bonds that helped finance the transaction.
Drexel ceased most operations this past winter, leaving
Charter to search for a new Wall Street adviser.</p>
<p>Despite Charter's current problems, Mr. Ford said Drexel
had been "very helpful" in structuring the initial buy-out
and selling the debt. He added that the plan to go private
was -- and still is -- a good idea. "It was a chance for
employers and management to benefit from their own work," he
said. "Employee ownership increases productivity."</p>
