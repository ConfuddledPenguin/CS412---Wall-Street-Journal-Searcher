	<p class="article-leader">Hanson PLC, Britain's largest industrial conglomerate,
said interim pretax profit rose 28% to #570 million ($958
million), a record high, for the six months to March 31, with
a record contribution from U.S. operations.
   Although Hanson couldn't be reached for comment on
extraordinary gains, industry analysts said they most likely
related to disposals during the past six months of assets
obtained from the #3.5 billion acquisition of Consolidated
Goldfields PLC in August 1989. So far, the disposal program
has generated #1.1 billion, Hanson said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Goldfields' U.S. operations, which realized a 21% profit
jump to #180 million from #149 million, made their first
contribution to Hanson's half-year results. Last November
Hanson announced the sale of four Arc America companies,
Goldfields assets, for $650 million.</p>
