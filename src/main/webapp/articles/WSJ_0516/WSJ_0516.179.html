	<p class="article-leader">A man who has lost his tongue has lost his land.
   -- 18th-century Cornish proverb</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MOUSEHOLE, England -- She has been dead for over two
hundred years, but Dolly Pentreath, a combative fishwife from
this tiny village in Cornwall, is still something of a
heroine around here.</p>
<p>Dolly was the last native speaker of Cornish, a
once-thriving Celtic language that died when she did, in
1777. In her last days, sought out by an English antiquarian,
she gave vent to a few well-chosen words of Cornish that the
historian later deciphered as "I will not speak English . . .
you ugly black toad]"</p>
<p>Like Dolly Pentreath, the Cornish people today are a
fiercely proud and stubborn lot. Which helps to explain two
developments in this remote, starkly beautiful corner of
southwest England: The Cornish -- against all odds -- have
brought their language back from the dead. And they are
fighting with one another about it tooth and nail.</p>
<p>That there's anything to fight about is something of a
linguistic miracle. Only one other lost tongue has been
successfully revived to everyday use -- Hebrew -- and it had
the full weight of the state of Israel behind it. Cornish
isn't in the same league. Though the numbers are growing each
year, only a few thousand have studied Cornish, of whom maybe
150 are completely fluent.</p>
<p>But the small number of speakers hasn't prevented a
brouhaha, complete with hate mail and even a death threat.
"What a glorious mess]" exclaims David Green, who is covering
the dispute for a local newspaper. "The whole county is
involved in an enormous row over an obscure language that
hardly anyone can speak." Readers of Mr. Green's newspaper,
the Western Morning News, have vented their outrage in
letters to the editor. A sampling: "this load of codswallop,"
"a tragic schism" and "utter rubbish]"</p>
<p>What's at the bottom of all this?</p>
<p>Spelling.</p>
<p>It seems there are now at least two spelling systems for
the revived Cornish language. The old way, called "unified"
Cornish, was developed by native Cornish scholars who started
the revival in the 1920s. It is based on how the language was
spelled in medieval literature and draws from the many
Cornish words that oldtimers from West Cornwall mixed into
their English conversation and from the huge numbers of
Cornish place names that still exist.</p>
<p>Then, about four years ago, a new spelling system called
"phonemic" Cornish started gaining adherents. Based on a
linguist's 1984 doctoral thesis, it attempts to simplify the
sometimes-illogical spelling of unified Cornish, in hopes of
making it easier to learn. For example, phonemic Cornish
abandons the letter "c," substituting "k" and "s" for hard
and soft consonant sounds, it introduces double consonants
for stressed syllables, and it makes clear distinctions
between "y" and "i" sounds. After a power struggle, the
phonemic camp, some of whom are not nativeborn Cornish,
gained control of the language's governing body, the Cornish
Language Board.</p>
<p>The dispute remained in the ivory tower until January,
when it emerged with a vengeance. John King, a member of the
Cornish Language Board and of the town council of Camborne,
persuaded the highway authorities to erect a road sign
reading "Welcome to Camborne" and, in phonemic Cornish,
"Kammbronn a'gas dynnergh."</p>
<p>Born in London, Mr. King is an ardent Cornish speaker who
teaches the language in a local school. But he didn't reckon
with the sensitivities of those long used to the
unified-Cornish spelling of "Cambron," the old name still
widely known. Irate phone calls and mail poured in to him and
to the press. He was called an Englishman -- an insult
hereabouts -- and accused of making a laughingstock of the
language and of giving the town a German name. One letter
writer, he says, threatened to kill him.</p>
<p>"It's a terribly racist view of what Cornishness is all
about," Mr. King declares. "Proponents of unified Cornish are
identified with blood Cornishmen. I've lived in Cornwall for
20 years, yet I'll always be seen as an outsider."</p>
<p>There are overtones here of the nationalist fervor that
swept Wales and Scotland in the 1970s, though Cornwall has
avoided the violence that plagued those regions. "Those who
want to steal our language think they know better than the
people born here," says Len Truran, a proponent of unified
Cornish whose small publishing house puts out textbooks,
poetry and novels in Cornish. Adds James Whetter, head of the
Cornish Nationalist Party. "If we don't hang on to our land
and language, Cornwall could sink into London suburbia by the
sea."</p>
<p>Cornishmen's distrust of outsiders goes back a long way,
to the fifth and sixth centuries. Their Celtic ancestors, who
occupied most of southern Britain and spoke a language called
Brythonic, were steadily driven westward by tribes of
Germanic invaders, the Angles and the Saxons, ending up in
Cornwall and Wales and splitting the language into Cornish
and Welsh. A third group of Celts fled to Brittany on the
continent; some 300,000 people there still speak a language
very similar to Cornish called Bretton.</p>
<p>Among more-recent invaders of Cornwall are
upper-middle-class Britons seeking country homes away from
the hurlyburly of London and its environs. Their arrival has
pushed real-estate prices beyond the reach of many born and
raised here.</p>
<p>Crowds are drawn to Cornwall by the land's haunting
loneliness. With the sea on three sides, it is almost severed
from the rest of Britain by the River Tamar.</p>
<p>In the mid-19th century some 50,000 miners hauled tin out
of deep shafts around the county, continuing a tradition of
underground work going back to the Bronze Age. That industry
is nearly all gone now, leaving Cornwall one of the poorest
counties in England. Like the ruins of some lost
civilization, the remains of rough-stone pumphouses and
smelter chimneys dot the windswept moors and perch on sea
cliffs.</p>
<p>Only a few decades ago, the language lay in ruins, too.
Now, proponents run evening classes and correspondence
courses, and speak Cornish at regular get-togethers in homes
and pubs. A number of state and parochial schools teach the
language, and a state-administered exam for secondary-school
students is graded in both the unified and phonemic systems.
There are church services in Cornish as well as summer camps
and play-groups for children. Banks here even accept checks
written in Cornish, though often grudgingly.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there's worry that the spelling dispute may
slow, or even kill, the language's comeback. "Cornish can't
afford an academic debate right now," says Diarmaid
Breathnach, administrator of the European Bureau of Lesser
Used Languages, a European Community agency in Dublin that
provides financial support for some 30 small, indigenous
tongues like Cornish. "Our reaction is, my God, your language
is in enough danger without splitting it apart yourselves."</p>
<p>Such worries seem far away from a recent Sunday afternoon
get-together of Cornish-speaking families near the town of
Liskeard. As their parents chat in the backyard, the children
play cricket in an adjoining sheep meadow, shouting happily
in Cornish. All of the eight or so youngsters are being
raised bilingually and seem at home in both tongues.
Eleven-year-old Lowena Sandercock says she would much rather
speak Cornish than English to her blond friend Tristan
Jenkin, age 20 months. Tristan's first word was "tikkidiw,"
Cornish for butterfly. (Pronounced TICKee-doo, its literal
meaning is "beautiful little thing of God.")</p>
<p>Tristan is a third-generation Cornish speaker, one of the
few in Cornwall. His grandfather, Richard Jenkin, was
instrumental in the language's rebirth and remains a vocal
advocate of unified Cornish. But Tristan's mother, Loveday
Jenkin, is on the opposite side of the fence: She's a teacher
of phonemic Cornish.</p>
<p>Richard Jenkin, who says he tries to avoid heated
arguments with his daughter, isn't optimistic that the
language battle will be resolved soon. "It's a sad thing
that's dividing friends from friends," he says. "I can't see
either side giving up its beliefs."</p>
<p>Loveday Jenkin takes a broader view. "It's largely an
academic problem, irrelevant to the many people who just want
to learn to speak," she says. "If the Cornish people are
arguing about it, it's proof the language is alive and
thriving."</p>
