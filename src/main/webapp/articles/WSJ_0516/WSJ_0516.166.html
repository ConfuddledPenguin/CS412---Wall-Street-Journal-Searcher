	<p class="article-leader">Munsingwear Inc., saying talks broke off with Irwin Jacobs
about the investor's proposal to take control of the
struggling apparel maker, announced plans to seek buyers for
two of its three units and to focus on menswear.
   Minneapolis-based Munsingwear, which got its start in the
men's underwear business 104 years ago, also said Charles J.
Campbell was appointed president and chief executive officer.
Mr. Campbell, 45 years old, joined the company last year as
president of the men's division and was responsible for the
introduction of its "Grand Slam" line of golf clothes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Campbell succeeds Lawrence L. Horsch as chief
executive. Mr. Horsch, 55, will continue as chairman while
the company seeks buyers for its LeRoi Princeton and
Munsingwear Canada divisions, which make infants' clothes and
women's sportswear, respectively. But Mr. Horsch's role will
be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Munsingwear and Mr. Jacobs said talks were terminated by
mutual agreement.</p>
