	<p class="article-leader">Great American Bank, which revised its fourth-quarter
results after a dispute with its auditor over loan-loss
reserves, disclosed a dispute with federal regulators over
how it values certain assets, potentially further
complicating the troubled thrift's survival plans.
   In addition, Great American, based in San Diego, reported
a net loss of $1.2 million, or five cents a share, for the
first quarter, compared with profit of $11 million, or 45
cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Great American, the nation's eighth-largest thrift with
$15.4 billion in assets, said federal thrift examiners have
questioned how it values certain of its loans, real estate
and other assets, and that the assumptions being used by
regulators would reduce its assets by at least $65 million.</p>
<p>The company defended its own assumptions, and said
discussions are continuing as the regulators complete their
exam. It added that it didn't know whether it would be
required to incur write-downs, and that "the potential loss
which may be required to be reported cannot reasonably be
estimated at this time." Any impact would likely be reflected
in results for the second quarter, the company said.</p>
<p>A write-down of $65 million would eliminate about half of
the company's tangible capital, which, standing at $128.9
million as of March 31, was already about $100 million shy of
meeting regulatory standards.</p>
<p>As reported, Great American has been a victim of the
real-estate bust in Arizona, and must raise at least $350
million in capital by year-end or else face regulatory
sanctions, possibly including seizure. Analysts have been
skeptical about the company's ability to attract that kind of
support, and said the latest disclosure would further
compound the task. The company has conceded that any such
infusion would likely seriously dilute the interests of
current shareholders.</p>
<p>"I can't think of a more difficult assignment for anyone
than to raise $350 million at this point in time, given the
real-estate uncertainties in their markets," said Allan
Bortel, a thrift analyst at Sutro & Co. in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Some analysts said Great American's dispute illustrates
the increasingly aggressive approach that regulators have
taken in forcing conservative accounting by banks and
thrifts, based on evidence that seized institutions had
greatly understated the extent of their troubled loans.</p>
<p>In a statement, Great American asserted that certain of
the regulators' assumptions were "not currently considered to
be in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Great American revised its
fourth-quarter financial results after its auditor, Deloitte
& Touche, posed concerns over the adequacy of its loan-loss
provisions. The revisions boosted Great American's net loss
for the quarter ended Dec. 31 to $198.9 million, or $8.30 a
share, from an initially reported $59.3 million, or $2.48 a
share.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the first-quarter results were unaudited,
but that asset-valuation methods used in the quarter were
consistent with those that Deloitte & Touche had approved in
the preceding quarter.</p>
