	<p class="article-leader">In his May 1 editorial-page account of the Committee for
the Free World's conference, David Frum quotes me as
describing American culture, because of its vitality, as
"poisonous" rather than merely "decadent" as Hilton Kramer
had argued. My offense was in truth a far more grievous one:
deliberate and premeditated irony.
   In response to Mr. Kramer's gloomy indictment of American
popular culture, I maintained that if he added an undoubted
vitality to his list of its defects, it would surely deserve
even sterner censure, viz., "poisonous." My argument would, I
thought, be understood by those present as a reductio ad
absurdum of Mr. Kramer's position, rather than as an
expression of my own views. After all, I went on to dissent
more plainly by making the ho-hummish argument that American
(and Western) culture has its good and bad points, and the
slightly more interesting one that some of its bad points
will be rectified shortly by the absorption into the Western
cultural mainstream of Central European writers who have
emerged from the experience of totalitarianism resistant to
cultural fashions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But these are transparent excuses. I ignored the advice,
given at my mother's knee, never to commit irony in a public
place; I am justly punished for it by your report; and Mr.
Kramer has the last laugh.</p>
