	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Ames Department Stores Inc., Rocky Hill,
Conn., which filed for bankruptcy court protection last
month, disclosed that its sales have plummeted in recent
weeks.
   The discount department store chain, which reported a $228
million loss for the fiscal year ended Jan. 27, disclosed the
recent sales slump at a bankruptcy court hearing yesterday to
determine whether it can receive $250 million in interim
financing from Chemical Bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Attorneys for various parties indicated they have reached
an agreement resolving differences between Ames and
pre-bankruptcy lenders, including Citibank, that had led
those lenders to object to the new financing. The court
indicated a decision on the financing would be made today.</p>
<p>According to testimony at the hearing, sales at Ames
stores dropped 30%, to $67.9 million for the week ended May
5; and sales declined 42%, to $53.4 million for the week
ended May 12.</p>
<p>Ames, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection
on April 25, has had trouble keeping its shelves fully
stocked as many vendors stopped shipping goods because they
hadn't been paid for past shipments. Ames previously received
bankruptcy court clearance for $25 million in financing. It
has said it needs the additional $225 million in financing to
continue its operation.</p>
<p>"If it doesn't have (additional) financing, it cannot
survive, because they're not going to get goods shipped to
them," said Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., an adviser to
certain creditors of Ames. He said he expects the financing
to be approved.</p>
<p>Separately, Ames reported a net loss of $228 million, or
$6.41 a share last year, compared with net income of $42
million, or $1.07 a share, in fiscal 1989. The latest year's
loss includes a restructuring charge of $137 million to cover
previously announced plans to close certain unprofitable
stores.</p>
