	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Mellon Bank Corp. said it agreed to sell its
consumer finance subsidiary, Mellon Financial Services Corp.,
to Associates Corp. of North America, a unit of Ford Motor
Co. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Separately, the bank holding company said its board
authorized it to purchase as many as 250,000 of its common
shares, as part of a plan announced last October.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transaction involving the consumer finance unit, which
is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close by
June 30 and to result in a one-time $75 million gain, Mellon
said. In 1989, Mellon earned $210 million, or $4.01 a share,
including an extraordinary credit of $29 million from
retirement of debt.</p>
<p>Assets covered by the transaction include 96 consumer
finance offices in 17 states, mainly in the Midwest and
western U.S., as well as $460 million in secured and
unsecured consumer finance loans. Mellon said it will retain
about $90 million of its commercial finance portfolio.</p>
<p>Mellon noted that the sale reflects its strategy to
concentrate on retail banking in the Central Atlantic region.
It said proceeds from the sale will help finance Mellon's
recent acquisition of Meritor Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Associates Corp., based in Dallas, is one of the nation's
largest finance companies, with assets of more than $15
billion.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Mellon shares closed at $27.50, down 25 cents, giving the new
buy-back authorization a current indicated value of about
$6.9 million.</p>
<p>Under the buy-back program, Mellon said it previously
purchased 250,000 of its common shares in connection with
benefit plan requirements. As of March 31, the company had
43.9 million common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Under the latest buy-back authorization, Mellon said it
can make purchases from time to time in the open market or
privately negotiated transactions. Shares bought back will be
added to the corporation's treasury shares and used to meet
Mellon's current and near-term common stock requirements for
its benefit plans.</p>
