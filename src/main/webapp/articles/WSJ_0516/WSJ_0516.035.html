	<p class="article-leader">MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian interest rates are
likely to stay high next fiscal year and the nation's
current-account deficit will deteriorate further, two
economists forecast.
   Philip Adams and Peter Dixon from the Institute of Applied
Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University predict
the current-account deficit will widen to 19.7 billion
Australian dollars (US$15.12 billion) for the fiscal year
ending June 30 from A$17.41 billion last fiscal year, and
deteriorate to $A20.53 billion next year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This will push the current-account deficit to 5.4% of
gross domestic product this fiscal year from 5.2% last year,
and back to 5.2% next fiscal year.</p>
<p>The economists say in the latest issue of the Institute's
Australian Economic Review that the current-account deficit
will deteriorate because interest payments overseas will keep
rising and prices for Australia's exports are likely to fall.</p>
