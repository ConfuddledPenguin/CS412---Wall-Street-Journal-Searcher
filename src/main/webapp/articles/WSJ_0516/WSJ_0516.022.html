	<p class="article-leader">ELECTRONIC FILING tickles the fancy of state tax
collectors, too.
   Over 4.2 million taxpayers filed federal returns
electronically this year; the benefits for accuracy and fast
refunds aren't lost on the states. New Mexico got 57,500
returns in the first broad use of this method by a state. It
accepted them through preparers and also invited low-income
filers to take their returns to local tax offices for
transmission. The state accepted 195 balance-due returns
filed early; it returned bills due April 16.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Michigan tried out electronic transmission of returns
taken to 12 district offices and got 3,100; it hopes to
expand next year by offering computer software to preparers
and individuals. New Mexico and Michigan both required signed
confirmation copies on paper, but that requirement is
expected to be dropped eventually.</p>
<p>To get experience, South Carolina's tax department
transmitted employees' federal returns to the IRS.</p>
<p>STATES MAY USE THE IRS as a conduit for electronically
filed state returns.</p>
<p>At least 20 of the 41 states with broad-based income taxes
are seriously interested in electronic filing, says South
Carolina's Tax Commission Chairman Howard, but they know
development will be costly and lengthy and that uniform
standards are desirable. So the Federation of Tax
Administrators, a state officials' group, has proposed to the
IRS that it be their intermediary: Both federal and state
returns would be filed by wire to the IRS; it would pass on
the state returns through existing channels for exchanging
data with states.</p>
<p>Combined transmissions could cut fees for taxpayers and
help promote electronic filing, Howard says. South Carolina
has been picked to test the idea and is working with the IRS
in the hope of having a system ready for the 1991 filing
season. Protecting taxpayers' privacy is a major concern,
Howard says, but he doesn't foresee taxpayer resistance to
the combined transmissions.</p>
<p>THE IRS'S FORGIVENESS of penalties often reflects its own
sins, the GAO says.</p>
<p>In 1988, the IRS says, it assessed 17.4 million penalties
totaling $3.8 billion for failure to file a return or to pay
tax due. It says it abated 14.4% of the penalties, totaling
$1.7 billion. In one of a series of reports on civil
penalties, Congress's General Accounting Office says this
high forgiveness rate led it to review the abatements. Its
conclusion: Too many result from IRS processing errors -- and
the statistics overstate the true level of IRS clemency.</p>
<p>The GAO studied 626 abatements granted in 1987 to filers
who claimed a reasonable cause; it found that 29% were needed
to correct IRS errors, mainly in coding returns or processing
filing extensions. A lack of documentation prevents the IRS
from identifying and fixing the causes, the GAO adds.
Further, it says, 80% of the reported 1988 abatements were
automatic adjustments based on changes in tax liability, not
waivers based on reviewing taxpayers' explanations.</p>
<p>IRS errors heat up taxpayer frustrations and create
burdens for the agency, the GAO says.</p>
<p>TEXAS WILL PHASE OUT sales taxes on manufacturing
equipment by the end of 1994, saving businesses over $1
billion in 1995. Meanwhile, legislators and the governor are
wrestling over proposals to raise as much as $555 million
more next year for public-school funding and avoid a
court-imposed tax equalization plan.</p>
<p>OUSTED AS TOO OLD, Frank E. Rickel won an
age-discrimination suit against his ex-employer and a
$180,000 settlement. The Tax Court said half was taxable as
wage-related. But the third-circuit appeals court has ruled
that the entire sum is tax-free as compensation for a
personal injury.</p>
<p>THREE MORE STATES -- Georgia, Oklahoma and Nebraska --
have enacted stamp or other taxes on illegal drugs, bringing
the total number of states with such provisions at least to
21. Innovator Minnesota has collected nearly $1.2 million
from voluntary payments and seizures of assets.</p>
<p>JUST DONATE MY FEE to my church, he advised, and we'll
both benefit.</p>
<p>The Universal Life Church, a big tax scam in the early
1980s, told people how to deduct gifts of money really used
for personal expenses. Scott E. Slayback Jr. of Altamonte
Springs, Fla., a return preparer and adviser on setting up
the phony churches, devised a special twist for his own use.
In 1982 and 1983, he had clients "donate" his fees to a
church he controlled and deduct them or pay the fees to a
partnership allegedly 75%-owned by the church.</p>
<p>Slayback spent the money on himself but reported almost no
taxable income. Then he bragged about his scheme to an IRS
undercover agent. Slayback said he was operating six or seven
churches out of a post-office box, that he had practiced law
without a license for 20 years, and that he could disrupt an
IRS audit. Yet when the IRS slapped him with a tax bill and
civil penalties, he turned to the Tax Court. Now Judge Parker
-- relying on "evidence from {Slayback's} own mouth" -- has
found him liable for taxes plus fraud and other penalties.</p>
<p>The judge also has imposed damages of $3,000 for bringing
frivolous claims before the court.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: The Treasury plans to begin negotiating a tax
treaty with Bulgaria next week. . . . IRS Notice 90-37 offers
guidance to employers for accelerated deposits of withheld
income and Social Security taxes required by 1989's tax act.
. . . Seeking revenue sources, legislative advisers say
California could raise $120 million by repealing its
sales-tax exemption for candy.</p>
