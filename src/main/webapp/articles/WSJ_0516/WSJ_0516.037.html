	<p class="article-leader">Your April 16 page-one story "Steady Inflation: Does
Anyone Care?" suggests that "perhaps most Americans are
correct not to care about inflation."
   In a highly intensive and largely mature economy, with 80%
of our GNP comprising services, inflation of 4.5% is not
manageable, it is pernicious. It causes a small percentage of
our people to get temporarily rich and a big percentage to
become permanently poor. It has impoverished and greatly
eroded the core of our middle class and established a
propensity among us to spend rather than to save, to
speculate rather than to invest and to lose respect for the
hard-earned dollar.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inflation is the worst form of taxation. As our Fed
appears, at least, to be committed to fight inflation, we
should see to it that it has many allies.</p>
