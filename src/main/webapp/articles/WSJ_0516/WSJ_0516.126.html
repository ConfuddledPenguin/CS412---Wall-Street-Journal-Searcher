	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A presidential commission, calling for
drastic action against air terrorism, urged that the U.S.
mount military strikes against terrorist enclaves to
discourage the kind of attack that downed Pan American World
Airways Flight 103.
   In a 182-page report, the commission appointed to look
into the Pan Am disaster also called for the reorganization
of aviation-security procedures. The panel concluded that the
Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of the jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, "may well have been preventable" and cited grave
security lapses by the airline and the Federal Aviation
Administration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Terrorists were able to place a bomb on Pan Am 103 not
because some one thing failed, but because the
aviation-security system failed," said Ann McLaughlin, who
headed the seven-member President's Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism. "The system was flawed and didn't
provide an effective defense against sabotage."</p>
<p>In its report, the commission said the U.S. should plan
and train for "pre-emptive or retaliatory military strikes"
against known terrorist hideouts and take covert action when
direct strikes are inappropriate. "When the perpetrators {of
the Pan Am bombing} are found they should be punished," Mrs.
McLaughlin told a press conference jammed with relatives of
people killed in the attack.</p>
<p>But the Bush administration isn't likely to launch an
anti-terrorism strike at a time when, according to a recent
State Department report, terrorist acts against the U.S. have
declined. The recent release of two Americans held captive in
Lebanon and signs that Iran and Syria, which are eager to
improve relations with the West, are working to win the
release of other hostages also suggest that the U.S. wouldn't
consider a strike.</p>
<p>Moreover, the U.S. military also has always been
uncomfortable with the idea of fielding the kind of
special-operations forces required to carry out surgical
strikes.</p>
<p>The White House embraced the broad outlines of the
terrorism report, but refused to commit itself to carrying
out any of its specific recommendations. "We agree we can
have a more aggressive policy, but we don't want to comment
on how," said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.</p>
<p>The commission didn't blame specific countries or
individuals for the Lockerbie bombing, saying that wasn't its
mission. The criminal investigation into the attack, which
killed all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground,
continues.</p>
<p>However, it is widely suspected that the bombing was
ordered by Iran in retaliation for the accidential downing of
an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf by a U.S. naval
vessel, and that it was carried out by the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command.</p>
<p>The presidential panel made dozens of recommendations to
counter the terrorist threat, including: the establishment of
a new supervisory office -- assistant secretary for security
and intelligence -- within the Transportation Department;
increased importance for the security operation within the
FAA; and the assigning of federal security managers with
direct access to the FAA chief to major international and
domestic airports.</p>
<p>The panel also urged the government to alert passengers to
credible threats and to establish criteria for when
passengers should be notified. Notification became an issue
after the Lockerbie disaster when it was disclosed that U.S.
embassy workers in Moscow were warned of a possible terrorist
attack on Pan Am flights through Frankfurt, West Germany.
Although the authorities have since concluded the threat was
a hoax, critics say the government practiced selective
notification, warning some citizens and not others.</p>
<p>In addition, in one of its most controversial suggestions,
the panel called for a halt to the FAA's plan to require the
installation of thermal neutron analysis bomb-detecting
machines at high-risk international airports. The panel said
the equipment, which can detect plastic explosives, isn't
reliable or effective enough, and it recommended that
research and development into other bomb-detecting
technologies be accelerated.</p>
<p>Since the bombing, the TNA machines have been a major
element in the FAA's stepped-up security program. They have
been installed in airports in New York and Miami, and the FAA
wanted airlines to buy 150 more for 40 more airports at a
cost of $175 million. But the commission said the machine
couldn't reliably detect the small amount of plastic
explosives believed used in the Pan Am explosion.</p>
<p>The commission said the bombing might have been prevented
had Pan Am done a better job of screening bags, especially
unaccompanied bags, and passengers. "Pan Am's generally poor
performance on security requirements at Frankfurt {where
Flight 103 originated} existed not only for months before the
tragedy but -- incredibly -- for nine months thereafter,"
Mrs. McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>The report added that the Pan Am security operation in
Frankfurt has been improved and is now a "model" for other
airlines. And it found that the overall state of
international aviation security has improved since the
destruction of Flight 103.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett
called the commission's criticism "unfair," adding, "we
believe that prior to the bombing of Flight 103, and
subsequent to it, we were providing a secure transportation
system."</p>
<p>The commission, which besides Mrs. McLaughlin consisted of
four members of Congress and two former military figures,
reserved much of its harshest criticism for the FAA, which it
described as largely "reactive" and failing to meet the
challenge of international terrorism. "The FAA's performance
was nothing short of dismal," said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R.,
N.Y.), a panel member.</p>
<p>In response, FAA Administrator James Busey acknowledged
that "the system was flawed, mistakes were made," and that he
plans to move forward on the panel's suggestions. But he also
contended that the agency has made some progress in improving
security over the past year, and said that for now, the
thermal-neutron-analysis machines were the best bomb
detectors available.</p>
<p>The families of the bombing's victims generally praised
the commission, although some took issue with its criticism
of the bomb-detecting machines. In addition, Michael Lemov,
an attorney for Families of Pan Am Flight 103/Lockerbie,
criticized the report for not urging that aviation security
be taken out of the FAA and assigned to a new, separate
agency.</p>
