	<p class="article-leader">Perkin-Elmer Corp. said it sold to a U.S. group a
semiconductor-equipment business that had become the focus of
concerns about Japanese inroads in the U.S. semiconductor
market.
   Nikon Corp. of Japan had expressed interest in
Perkin-Elmer's so-called optical lithography technology, used
to produce semiconductors. Nikon's move drew fire from U.S.
semiconductor companies because of fears that U.S. makers of
chip-production equipment are dying off or are being bought
up by their overseas competition, especially the Japanese.
That could mean U.S. semiconductor makers would wind up
buying equipment from their overseas competitors, worsening
the U.S. industry's already precarious position. While
industry executives have said the likelihood of a sale of the
Perkin-Elmer business to the Japanese was overstated, they
said the concerns are legitimate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday's announcement illustrates the sorts of joint
efforts that U.S. companies apparently are prepared to enter
into in coming years as they try to keep the U.S.
semiconductor-equipment business alive.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Group Inc., a small company based in San
Jose, Calif., bought a two-thirds interest in the business,
which Perkin-Elmer has been trying to sell for more than a
year. International Business Machines Corp. will also have an
equity interest in the business, which will be renamed SVG
Lithography Systems Inc. Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Conn., will
retain slightly less than a 20% stake. The value of the
transaction was not disclosed.</p>
<p>IBM, Armonk, N.Y., has promised to invest heavily in the
business's research and development in return for early
access to the results. Sematech, a group of U.S. companies
and the government, has also entered into a joint development
agreement with SVG.</p>
<p>In addition, IBM has pledged to buy a substantial amount
of the equipment, which uses the optical-lithography
techniques.</p>
<p>Some semiconductor makers have reservations about the
technology. While it is useful for making larger chips, they
say, it is more expensive and less efficient than other
systems for almost all types of chips now in use.</p>
<p>Jack Kuehler, president of IBM, believes the Perkin-Elmer
optical-lithography technology will become very important in
the next generation of semiconductors. He said the devices,
called Micrascans, can use ultraviolet light, with its short
wavelengths, to etch extremely thin lines on silicon wafers.
Mr. Kuehler said the Micrascans can also expose larger
segments of a wafer at one time than can systems now in wide
use, allowing for the production of larger chips and for
faster production of chips.</p>
