	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s head of
investment banking, Douglas E. Ebert, resigned after failing
to win the top spot in a newly combined commercial and
investment banking unit.
   For nearly a year, Mr. Ebert -- whose combined salary and
bonus of $625,913 last year made him one of the big bank's
five most highly paid executives -- had set his sights on
heading such a combined unit, and he was widely regarded as
the frontrunner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So, he was clearly disappointed when the company chose not
to put a single individual in charge, but instead to have six
group heads for commercial and investment banking report
directly to Manufacturers Hanover President Thomas S.
Johnson.</p>
<p>The reorganization firmly puts the imprint of Mr. Johnson,
formerly the No. 2 executive at rival Chemical Banking Corp.,
on Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's ninth-largest banking
company. It also signals the completion of a long and painful
restructuring and recapitalization that began more than two
years ago.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the bank, Mr. Ebert said, "I
support and indeed have been a strong advocate of the need to
create an integrated wholesale bank structure. My preference
would have been to head up the wholesale bank. However, I
understand and support the feeling that Tom Johnson should
have the new global banking group reporting directly to him.</p>
<p>"Having my own career objective, I feel it is the
appropriate time to pursue advancement opportunities outside
the institution," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ebert, 44 years old, didn't return telephone calls
seeking comment and reportedly doesn't have job plans. In an
interview yesterday, Mr. Johnson said that some departures
were "inevitable when you try to take a level of management
out." He added, "We're sorry to lose him."</p>
<p>Despite his abilities, Mr. Ebert was actively opposed for
the top post by some senior managers who felt he was too
abrasive and wouldn't work well in the "team" environment
that Mr. Johnson is creating, according to a bank executive.</p>
<p>Two other names mentioned most often to head the new
combined commercial and investment banking unit, Donald H.
McCree and Donald G. McCouch, are remaining with
Manufacturers Hanover, although with somewhat diminished
responsibilities. Mr. McCree, who was in charge of corporate
banking, will now head up business with other financial
institutions, including sales of loans and other financial
products; Mr. McCouch, formerly head of banking and
international lending, will be in charge of
developing-country loans and other business.</p>
<p>The biggest winners in the reorganization are Mark G.
Solow, the head of acquisition finance, who now also has
responsibility for energy and media lending and venture
capital; Michael Hegarty, the head of real estate lending,
who now also oversees lending to medium-sized companies, the
bank's branch network, private banking and personal trust,
and Donald H. Layton, head of trading, who now adds treasury
responsibilities. Messrs. Solow and Layton will report to Mr.
Johnson; Mr. Hegarty will report to Vice Chairman Edward
Miller.</p>
<p>All three men are young rising stars within Manufacturers
Hanover. Mr. Solow has made Manufacturers one of the three
leading lenders to leveraged buy-outs, while avoiding the
major financings that have gotten into trouble. Under Mr.
Layton, Manufacturers has made progress penetrating markets
for financial hedging products, such as swaps contracts. And
Mr. Hegarty has rebuilt Manufacturer's real estate lending
business after disastrous loans in the Southwest ballooned in
the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>The other group executives that will report directly to
Mr. Johnson are Mr. McCree; Herbert F. Aspbury, North
American markets; James R. Brokken, who continues to work
with European clients, and John J. Simone, who will work with
Asian customers. Reporting to Mr. Miller will be Charles R.
Walsh, group executive for credit cards, and Richard J.
Matteis, group executive for operating services.</p>
<p>James McCormick, a bank consultant with First Manhattan
Consulting Group, said that by combining commercial and
investment banking activites and not superimposing a new
layer of management, Manufacturers is attempting to "do
something distinctive with its products."</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson said, "Manufacturers has a tremendous set of
client franchises in such areas as media and energy. At the
other end of the organization, we have all these products,
such as swaps. They've grown up separately from each other.
One of the objects of the reorganization is to create a
flexible organizational structure that allows us to move
resources to opportunities."</p>
<p>How well the union of commercial and investment banking
activities works will be vital to Manufacturers Hanover's
future.</p>
<p>Manufacturers in recent years has shrunk its size, boosted
its capital levels and begun building its reserves against $5
billion of loans to five problem Latin American borrowers.</p>
<p>Since 1985, Manufacturers has shrunk its assets to $60.4
billion from $76.5 billion. It has sold its consumer-finance
subsidiary, mortgage company, investment-managment unit and a
controlling stake in the CIT Group Inc., a major finance
company. Manufacturers has increased its level of assets that
can be readily converted into cash to 29% of total assets
from 16% in 1985, and it has increased its common equity to
4.8% of assets from 3.8% in 1985.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Manufacturers needs to show some earnings
growth, analysts say. It has propped up its stock price by
keeping its dividend high, but the heavy payout has kept the
bank's rate of internal capital generation low.</p>
<p>Manufacturers also needs to pare down its high level of
nonperforming loans. Nonperforming assets at the end of last
year were 7.9% of total loans, the highest level among the
nation's 10 largest banks. The bank's nonperforming assets
were only 2.8% of total loans in 1985.</p>
