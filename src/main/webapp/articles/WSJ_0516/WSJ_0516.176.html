	<p class="article-leader">BALTIC UNREST FLARED as Baker arrived in Moscow for
arms-control talks.
   Soviet loyalists converged on the Parliament in Estonia
and briefly raised the hammer-and-sickle flag. The breakaway
republic's premier broadcast an appeal to stave off a "coup
attempt." In Latvia, anti-independence demonstrators clashed
with a group supporting a secession bid. It was the first
glimpse of political violence in the Baltic republics, and
came as the U.S. secretary of state began a four-day visit to
Moscow aimed at concluding superpower arms agreements for
signing at the Bush-Gorbachev summit, which begins May 30 in
Washington.</p>

<p>A PRESIDENTIAL PANEL URGED drastic action against air
terrorism.</p>
<p>In a 182-page report, the commission appointed to look
into the December 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over
Scotland called for the U.S. to mount military strikes
against terrorist enclaves to discourage the kind of attack
that killed 270 people. The panel, concluding that the
Lockerbie incident "may well have been preventable," called
for the reorganization of aviation-security procedures,
citing lapses by the airline and the FAA.</p>
<p>The head of an organization representing the families of
British victims of the bombing expressed opposition to the
panel's call for military retaliation.</p>

<p>West Germany plans a $70.02 billion special unity fund
financed by credits to help pay for the reconstruction of
East Germany's economy through 1994. Establishment of the
financing vehicle for German reunification depended on the
willingness of 11 state governments to commit to a 50% share
of the fund.</p>

<p>Striking Nicaraguan workers defied Managua's call to
return to work and riot police clashed with pro-Sandinista
government employees occupying two ministries. Thousands of
people joined the walkout for higher pay. In Washington, the
White House was considering a request from Chamorro for a $40
million short-term loan.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Rehnquist criticized proposals by senators on changing the
law on appeals to federal courts by state death-row
prisoners. Addressing the American Law Institute in
Washington, the chief justice said there is a "serious
malfunction" in the capital-punishment system, leading to
uncertainty and endless delays.</p>

<p>Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" sold for $82.5 million
at Christie's auction house in New York, a world record price
for a work of art. The oil-on-canvas painting of the artist's
physician and friend, completed a few weeks before van Gogh's
suicide, reportedly was bought by a gallery in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Philippine Communist rebels claimed responsibility for the
weekend slaying of two U.S. airmen. Manila's government,
meanwhile, in a procedural step that paves the way for a
possible new accord, served official notice to terminate in
1991 the current 25-year pact over six U.S. military bases in
the Philippines.</p>

<p>The Justice Department said about 90 of the roughly 680
U.S. bank accounts that were frozen at its behest last month
are still thought to contain illegal Colombian drug profits.
The other 590 accounts have been "unfrozen" as prosecutors
have discovered they were either empty or contained
legitimate assets.</p>

<p>Washington's Mayor Barry pleaded innocent to six new drug
charges alleging he used cocaine over a five-year period. The
charges were brought last week. He previously pleaded
innocent to charges brought in February of cocaine-possession
and lying to a grand jury. A trial is set for June 4.</p>

<p>Serbian Borisav Jovic took over as head of Yugoslavia's
collective presidency, a change that could exacerbate
political and ethnic tensions. The 62-year-old Communist
hard-liner said the nation was close to civil war, and that
Belgrade would "resolutely oppose" any move to abandon
socialism.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Israel's legislature opened debate on bills calling for
the direct election of the prime minister, part of electoral
changes demanded during recent protests. Separately, police
fired tear gas at Jewish settlers who rampaged through Arab
neighborhoods in the Jerusalem area, and Palestinians in the
occupied lands staged a general strike.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Rival Christian forces ignored a ceasefire call by
Lebanon's Maronite Catholic leaders and dueled with artillery
in eastern Beirut and the surrounding countryside. Moslem
factions fought street battles in western Beirut. Lebanese
police said at least 24 people were killed in the fighting.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Nepal's King Birendra agreed to share power with an
interim government led by Prime Minister Bhattarai. In a
statement issued in Katmandu, the monarch also said he would
dissolve a constitutional committee that had threatened the
Himalayan country's recent steps toward democracy.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Iraq denied that it was trying to build a giant gun
capable of firing shells hundreds of miles, and demanded that
Italy compensate Baghdad for about 90 tons of steel parts
seized in Naples last week. Britain, West Germany, Greece and
Turkey also have confiscated Iraqi-bound gear in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Police in Atlanta arrested five anti-abortion protesters
belonging to the group Operation Rescue after they entered an
abortion clinic and chained themselves together in defiance
of a court order barring such demonstrations. The Georgia
injunction was upheld Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
