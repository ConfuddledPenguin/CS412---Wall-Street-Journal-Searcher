	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CBS won the prime-time ratings last week for
the first time since June 1988.
   According to the A.C. Nielsen Co., CBS Inc.'s TV network
finished first with 11.7% of the audience, followed by NBC, a
unit of General Electric Co., with 11.5% and ABC, a division
of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., with 11%. Nielsen is a unit of
New York-based Dun & Bradstreet Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CBS's victory was attributed to its strong ratings on
Sunday, with "60 Minutes" and "Shattered Dreams" a
made-for-TV movie, and on Monday with two hours of comedies
and a one-hour special hosted by Connie Chung.</p>
<p>ABC had the top three shows, including "America's Funniest
Home Videos," which was No. 1. A companion show, "America's
Funniest . . . Part II" was rated No. 3. "Roseanne" was No.
2.</p>
<p>CBS also had the lowest-rated show, the Saturday night
comedy series, "City," which attracted only 3.3% of the
viewers. That was the lowest-rated network show in history
tying "Live From Studio 8H" on NBC in January 1982.</p>
