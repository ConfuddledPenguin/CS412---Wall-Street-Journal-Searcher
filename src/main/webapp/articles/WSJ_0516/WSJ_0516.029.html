	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said about 90 of the
roughly 680 U.S. bank accounts that were frozen at its behest
last month are still thought to contain illegal Colombian
drug profits.
   The other 590 accounts have been "unfrozen" as prosecutors
studying the accounts have discovered they were either empty
or contained legitimately obtained assets, Justice Department
officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bush administration had touted the bank-account
investigation as an unusually sweeping aspect of a larger
money-laundering probe known as Operation Polar Cap. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady last month called the freezing of
the accounts "one of the most significant law enforcement
undertakings involving bank account seizures in U.S.
history."</p>
<p>Treasury and Justice Department officials claimed at the
time that the suspect accounts had received as much as $400
million in illegal profits from sales of Colombian cocaine
and other drugs as of early 1989.</p>
<p>Doug Tillett, a Justice Department spokesman, said he
couldn't estimate how much money the government might win in
pending forfeiture proceedings against the 90 accounts still
under investigation.</p>
<p>Government officials now are stressing that their original
goal was to gather information on illegal drug finances, not
to recover the money. Prosecutors "were more interested in
following the paper trail," Mr. Tillett said. "All along, we
said we didn't know that there would be any money at all."</p>
<p>The number of accounts that the government attempted to
keep frozen by means of court orders "dwindled dramatically"
since mid-April, as hundreds of account holders "came in to
present their bona fides," he said.</p>
<p>The cleared account holders have included businesses and
individuals, including some Colombians not thought to be
involved in drug trafficking. Prosecutors are proceeding with
forfeiture actions against some Colombians who purchased U.S.
currency on the Colombian black market, which is thought to
be a principle mechanism for the laundering of drug profits.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald has reported on the large number of
accounts that have been unfrozen in that city. Most of the
frozen accounts were at banks in Miami and New York and were
thought to have received illegal proceeds from the operations
of some of the world's biggest cocaine traffickers who belong
to the so-called Medellin Cartel.</p>
<p>Wilmer Parker, an assistant U.S. attorney in Atlanta and a
lead prosecutor in Operation Polar Cap, said, "We are very
satisfied and pleased with the information we have gotten
from the account holders and others." Last month, Mr. Parker
predicted that a "certain small percentage" of the targeted
accounts might turn out to be controlled by legitimate
businesses and indviduals.</p>
<p>Prosecutors haven't charged any of the banks affected by
the account-freezings with wrongdoing. But prosecutors have
declined to rule out that step.</p>
