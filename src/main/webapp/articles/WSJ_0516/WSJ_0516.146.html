	<p class="article-leader">Kent Electronics Corp., Houston, said it adopted a
shareholder rights plan intended to deter a hostile takeover.
In connection with that plan, the company declared a
distribution of one preferred stock purchase right on each
Kent common share outstanding. The distribution will be made
on May 24, 1990, to holders of record on that date, the
company said.
   The rights are exercisable if any person or group acquires
20% or more of Kent's common stock, or announces an offer to
acquire 30% or more of the common stock. Each right entitles
shareholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of Kent's
Series A preferred stock, $1 par value per share, for $40.
Each right also entitles shareholders to purchase Kent
commmon stock, or securities of an acquiring entity, at half
of market value.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the actions were designed to assure that
all shareholders receive fair treatment if any person or
group attempts a takeover of the company. The company said it
was not aware of any takeover plans.</p>
