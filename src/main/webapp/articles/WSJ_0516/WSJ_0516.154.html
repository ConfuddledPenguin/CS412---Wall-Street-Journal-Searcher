	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has
surged to a multiple of 16.3 times earnings, Wall Street has
had an explanation for it all.
   The reason stock prices have been climbing while earnings
have been falling, analysts say, is that interest rates have
also gone into a swoon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But according to one significant yardstick that compares
stock multiples with interest rates, the S&P 500 is more
expensive now than at any time since before the October 1987
crash.</p>
<p>"Relative to the bond market, stock prices look 15% to 20%
overpriced," says Leon G. Cooperman, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management.</p>
<p>Despite the recent bond rally, yields on government bonds
are up considerably -- more than 0.6 of a percentage point --
since year-end. All things being equal, that should warrant
lower stock prices. But the S&P 500 index is up marginally
from its year end close of 353.4.</p>
<p>"In my view, bonds represent a very good alternative to
equities," says Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief strategist for
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the brokerage arm of Barclays Bank.</p>
<p>A good proxy for the relative worth of stocks and bonds is
what Salomon Brothers terms the "earnings/yield gap." The
term sounds arcane, but the concept is basic.</p>
<p>The earnings yield on stocks is the return (defined as the
annual corporate earnings) divided by the share price. If a
company earning $1 a share sells for $100, the yield to
investors, whether paid out in dividends or kept as retained
earnings, is 1%. (The earnings yield is also equal to one
divided by the price/earnings multiple.)</p>
<p>The earnings/yield gap is obtained by starting with the
rate prevailing on 10-year government bonds and subtracting
the earnings yield of the S&P 500 stocks. Right now, this gap
amounts to 2.48 percentage points.</p>
<p>In other words, the 8.6% interest that investors can
collect on 10-year government bonds is almost 2.5 percentage
points higher than the earnings yield on stocks. Today's gap
is still far narrower than the precrash extreme of 4.67
percentage points. Yet it is wider than at any time since
just before Black Monday.</p>
<p>Michael Belkin, the Salomon analyst who tracks the yield
gap, says "it's probably the best `quick and dirty' measure
of the relationship between stock prices and interest rates."</p>
<p>When the yield gap widens, it signals that stocks,
relative to the risk-free returns available in the government
bond market, are becoming pricier. Bargain-priced stocks are
more likely to be found when the gap is narrow.</p>
<p>In the bear market of the 1970s, the yield gap was often
negative -- meaning that bonds were yielding less than
stocks. In the early 1980s, a period of double-digit interest
rates, the gap briefly widened to more than four percentage
points. It narrowed in the mid-1980s, and then roared to a
record high just before Black Monday.</p>
<p>"If the gap is too large compared to its historical range,
it probably means that stocks are vulnerable," Mr. Belkin
says, adding: "Stock prices can't shrug off interest rates
forever."</p>
<p>But Mr. Belkin isn't among those who believe that the gap
today is so large as to suggest that stocks are overvalued.
Looking back to the early 1980s, he says the gap is well
within its historical range.</p>
<p>Japan's stock market, despite its recent slide, is more
expensive than the U.S. market, Mr. Belkin adds. In fact, by
this measure, he says, Japanese stocks are more overvalued
than they were at year end -- when prices were 20% higher --
because interest rates in Japan also have risen.</p>
<p>"Even with the recent stock market slide, Japanese stocks
don't reflect the rise in Japanese interest rates," Mr.
Belkin says. The yield gap in Japan is 5.02%, compared with
4.22% at year end.</p>
<p>Stock market savants say it's indisputable that, at some
level, a rising yield gap spells trouble. The hard part?
Determining when.</p>
<p>"The problem is, you're taking a snapshot at one instant
in time," says George Michaelis, president of First Pacific
Advisers. "Stocks have earnings growth, and interest rates
can be very volatile." In the early 1980s, he says, a large
yield gap obscured the fact -- observable in retrospect --
that stocks held "tremendous value."</p>
<p>Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch, agrees that stocks are overvalued relative to bonds
but, he adds: "Over the past 20 years the normal boundary has
been rising. It has taken higher values of overvaluation to
stop the market."</p>
<p>Investors, he says, have become more optimistic about
earnings growth as the economic expansion has continued --
pushing up price/earnings multiples and also such measures as
the yield gap. Thus, to some extent, the yield gap can be
considered a measure of investors' expectations for earnings
growth.</p>
<p>Investors are still sanguine, Mr. Clough says dryly, "even
though there is no sign of an earnings bottom." Dillon Read
research chief Joseph McAlinden says stocks aren't overvalued
relative to bonds, because he expects corporate earnings to
rise.</p>
<p>Goldman's Mr. Cooperman, computes what he says is a more
dynamic version of the yield gap. Mr. Cooperman's model
factors in a "risk premium" for owning stocks and assumes
that, over the long haul, corporate earnings will grow 7% a
year.</p>
<p>He also concludes that, relative to bonds, stocks are
overvalued. Over time, Mr. Cooperman says the balance between
markets should be rectified in one of three ways. He expects
"a drop in stock prices, a further decline in interest rates,
or the passage of time, allowing earnings to catch up."</p>
