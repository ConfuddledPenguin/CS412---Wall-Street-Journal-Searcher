	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Brady debt strategy is placing more
emphasis on continued bank lending to indebted developing
nations.
   In the latest transaction under the Brady strategy,
Venezuela's creditor banks have mostly opted either to make
new loans or to cut loan interest rates in exchange for more
collateral, such as U.S. Treasury bonds that guarantee
principal repayments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's strategy, announced in
March 1989, stressed cutting back bank debt and interest
payments of several heavily indebted developing nations in
order to alleviate the international debt problem.</p>
<p>More recently, though -- as in the Venezuelan transaction
-- banks have been offered stronger incentives for continuing
lending to big debtor countries. In the current Venezuelan
debt agreement, the banks' new loans -- made by buying
tradeable bonds issued by the country -- offer the banks
better opportunities to convert loans into equity investments
in the country.</p>
<p>A shortage of further bank loans for Mexico hampered the
first transaction made under the Brady strategy. But new
loans totaling more than $100 million from two French
government-owned banks -- Credit Lyonnais and Banque
Nationale de Paris -- played an important role in ensuring
there were sufficient funds to complete that transaction,
bankers say.</p>
<p>Under an agreement reached this past March, Venezuela's
creditor banks were offered a number of options for loans to
that country: The banks could either tender their credits at
a discount, offer Venezuela cuts in its debt principal or
interest payments in exchange for more collateral, or lend
the country new money.</p>
<p>By Friday, banks holding 90%, or $18.45 billion, of
Venezuela's long-term foreign commercial bank debt had chosen
their options. According to bankers close to the transaction,
banks holding about $5.5 billion of that country's $20.5
billion of foreign long-term debt have decided to lend
further funds, meaning Venezuela will receive at least $1.15
billion in additional bank loans over two years.</p>
<p>In recent days, however, some bankers have begun to wonder
if Venezuela needs new loans in light of the sharp increase
in the price of oil, which makes up almost all of that
country's exports.</p>
<p>Meantime, banks holding more than $6 billion of Venezuelan
debt have chosen to exchange their existing loans for
so-called par bonds, which carry a fixed-interest rate of
6.75% and will be collateralized with securities from the
U.S. Treasury or some other Western government. This gives
Venezuela an important break in its interest payments;
currently the country pays a floating rate of about 10% on
most of its borrowings.</p>
<p>Bankers say that they will continue to lend to countries
such as Venezuela if the terms are attractive. "There's a
lesson here, new money properly packaged is available in a
Brady deal for a country with a history of paying its bills,"
said Peter McPherson, executive vice president of Bank of
America and a negotiator in the Venezuelan talks. Mr.
McPherson, though, added that his bank didn't lend further
money but, instead, "chose the par bond option (which holds
the interest rate to a fixed 6.75%) because it gave it
substantial additional collateral with a trade-off of
somewhat lower interest rates."</p>
<p>In addition, banks holding more than $2 billion of
Venezuelan bank debt tendered their credits for purchase by
the country's government, bankers said. Terms of this
so-called buy-back will be set later. Meantime, banks with
about $3 billion of Venezuelan debt opted to take a 30%
discount in the face value of their loans in exchange for
more collateral. Venezuela has a total of $35 billion in
government and private-sector foreign debt.</p>
