	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Quotations Panel of London's Stock Exchange
Friday criticized the chairman of Polly Peck International
PLC for the manner in which the chairman attempted to take
the company private.
   In a lengthy statement released after the market closed,
the panel said Asil Nadir failed to follow "normal standards"
when advising the company's board that he wished to make an
offer for the diversified company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The panel has powers to delist or suspend a company's
shares if it finds wrongdoing or it can issue a public
statement on its report. The panel has conveyed its findings
to the relevant authorities, but didn't elaborate.</p>
<p>The stock exchange also was disapproving of Mr. Nadir's
decision to ignore advice from financial advisers as well as
his calling a board meeting at such short notice on a Sunday.
Additionally, they found that the wording used in announcing
that an offer might be made for the company was misleading in
that it didn't state discussions were still at a preliminary
stage.</p>
<p>The company and chairman said it noted the findings of the
panel. It added that Polly Peck is "committed to ensuring the
long-term maximization of shareholder value and will continue
to work towards this end." It said neither the company nor
Mr. Nadir wish to make any further comment on the panel's
announcement.</p>
