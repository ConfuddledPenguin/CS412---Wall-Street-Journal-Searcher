	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- The Persian Gulf crisis has fueled a rapid
surge in Italy's inflation, wiping out progress made over the
past six months, pushing up interest rates and adding to the
government's woes as it attempts to bring the runaway budget
deficit under control.
   Consumer prices rose between 6.2% and 6.3% this month from
a year earlier, sharply higher than July's 5.7%
consumer-price increase and the worst performance since
February. The August projection is based on early data from
major Italian cities. The official inflation figure is due
out at the end of the month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Higher prices for gasoline and other oil products were
largely to blame for the jump, but the mid-month figures
don't yet reflect the full rise in oil prices since the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, officials said. Apart from the shock
effect of oil-price increases, inflation also was boosted by
a 20% rise in national newspaper prices from the start of
August.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected inflation to accelerate this month,
not only because of the Gulf crisis but also because of last
week's news of a surge in annual wholesale prices, to 5.5% in
June from 3.9% in May.</p>
<p>On a month-to-month basis, consumer prices in major cities
grew between 0.6% and 0.7% in August from 0.4% in July.</p>
<p>Italy, which relies on imports for about 80% of its energy
needs, is particularly vulnerable to the Gulf tension; it
buys around 35% of its crude oil from the region. With spot
crude prices now around $30 a barrel and prospects fading for
a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis, Italian bankers and
business leaders are resigning themselves to a harsher
economic environment over the coming months.</p>
<p>One early result could be higher interest rates. As
recently as last month Bank of Italy Governor Carlo A. Ciampi
predicted that inflation would fall to around 5% by the end
of this year from 6.5% at the end of 1989. In May, the
Treasury felt confident enough to cut the official discount
rate by a percentage point, to 12.5%, and banks in turn
lowered their commercial lending rates.</p>
<p>Now speculation is growing in the financial community here
that banks will raise rates at least half a percentage point
to take into account the gloomier inflation outlook --
possibly within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The lira's slide within the European Monetary System over
the past month, particularly against the mark, has given
Italian monetary authorities more room for maneuver should
they wish to tighten rates.</p>
<p>At the start of this month the mark fell as low as 731.78
lire, fractionally above its EMS floor of 731.57 lire, as
gloom over the mounting costs of German unification hit the
currency. But with the dollar weakening sharply and focus now
switched to the Gulf, the mark has gained ground rapidly in
recent days. It climbed to 747 lire Thursday in Milan, only
slightly below its EMS mid-rate of 748.217 lire.</p>
<p>Yields on fixed-rate government bonds already have risen
on expectations of higher inflation and events in the
Mideast. The net yield on 12.5% four-year Treasury paper is
currently above 12%, compared with 11.5% barely two months
ago.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates are bad news for Treasury Minister
Guido Carli, however, as he prepares the ground for the 1991
budget, scheduled for Cabinet approval by the end of
September.</p>
<p>His task is to try to cut the budget deficit to around
L115 trillion ($99 billion) next year from this year's L135
trillion ($116 billion). Mr. Carli has already warned that
spending cuts will be painful. But it is far from clear where
savings will be found, and the government can ill afford to
pay higher interest rates on its rising stock of debt.</p>
<p>Mr. Carli met with Budget Minister Paolo Cirino Pomicino
and Health Minister Francesco De Lorenzo Thursday to discuss
possible cuts in health spending, one of the largest and
least-efficient items in the state budget. Since the Gulf
crisis reduces the likelihood of cuts in defense spending,
Mr. Carli will be turning up the pressure in other ministries
to come up with concrete proposals for big savings.</p>
