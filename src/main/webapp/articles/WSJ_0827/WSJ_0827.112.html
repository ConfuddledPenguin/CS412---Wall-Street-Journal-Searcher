	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co. said it's extending for two weeks a
temporary shutdown at its Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant
because of a parts shortage.
   The plant was scheduled to reopen Sept. 4 but now is
slated to reopen the week of Sept. 10, the company said. Ford
said the temporary shutdown "is necessitated by a parts
shortage related to start-up of the new 2.3-liter engine."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The assembly plant builds about 3,700 Ford Mustangs a week
and already has been idle for two weeks. Initially, Ford
idled the plant for one week in mid-August because of weak
demand for the Mustangs. Since then it has been idle because
of the parts shortage.</p>
<p>The combined four weeks of no production will result in
about 14,000 fewer Mustangs and will idle 2,100 hourly
workers.</p>
