	<p class="article-leader">Granite Co-operative Bank, Quincy, Mass., reported a
fiscal first-quarter loss of $82,000, or 10 cents a share,
and said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has proposed
that the bank consent to a cease-and-desist order.
   The loss for the quarter, ended July 31, came after a
provision for possible loan losses of $138,000. Granite had
net income of $144,000, or 18 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. In last year's first quarter, the loss
provision was $38,000. The bank's assets at July 31 declined
to $109,496,000, from $129,643,000 at July 31, 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Granite said the order with the FDIC will outline
corrective action designed to improve the bank's condition.
It said it expects to negotiate specific terms of the order
with the FDIC.</p>
<p>Many New England banks, suffering from economic woes and a
downturn in the area real estate market, have entered into
similar agreements with various regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>Granite's loss for the first quarter follows the bank's
loss of $4,768,000, or $5.87 per share, for the year ended
April 30, after a loan loss provision of $2,730,000.</p>
