	<p class="article-leader">ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota authorities, concerned about
North Star Universal Inc.'s debt load, are requiring the
company to report its financial health to the state monthly.
   State Commerce Commissioner Thomas H. Borman said the
requirement follows an investigation by his department into
North Star's sale of subordinated debentures in Minnesota, a
primary source of capital for the Minneapolis-based holding
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Questions had been raised in the media about North Star's
ability to service that unsecured debt, which exceeded $36
million as of last Dec. 31. All told, North Star had
long-term debt of $114 million at the end of 1989, compared
with $50.8 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Borman also said North Star must maintain its majority
control of Michael Foods Inc., although "we would have no
problem if they sell the stock and raise enough capital to
improve their liquidity situation or retire the debt. We want
to make sure they maintain control because the dividend
Michael pays to North Star is an important element in
servicing that debt."</p>
<p>The Michael shares are pledged as collateral to First
National Bank of Minneapolis, North Star's primary lender.
The bank asked for the collateral after North Star
technically defaulted on its previous credit line.</p>
<p>North Star officials recently indicated they were
considering selling all or part of its 53.9% stake in
Michael. Last year Michael accounted for 74% of North Star's
revenue and 80% of consolidated subsidiary operating profits.
North Star reported a loss of $2.3 million, or 28 cents a
share, last year.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with the state, North Star must
maintain a .91:1 ratio of debt to cash and cash equivalents,
the commissioner said. The debt excludes salaries, wages and
current mortgage payments. The cash equivalents include the
Michael stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Borman said his investigators concluded that North
Star currently has a "substantial liquidity cushion" because
of the value of its Michael stock. But he added that if
Michael shares fall below $12 a share, "there would be a
problem" and "we would have to get involved again."</p>
<p>Should that occur, Mr. Borman said his office would "sit
down with the company and determine levels of liquid assets."
He added that North Star could improve both sides of its
balance sheet with certain asset sales. The company has
retained Goldman, Sachs to help explore restructuring
options.</p>
<p>Mr. Borman said that should North Star not be in
compliance with the ratio, he has the authority to revoke its
right to issue debt within the state.</p>
<p>North Star officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Since 1987, when Michael Foods was formed, North Star says
it has experienced cash-flow deficits, resulting in increased
bank borrowings. But North Star has financed a substantial
portion of its non-food units through debenture programs,
which it markets itself. "Historically, a substantial portion
of maturing debentures has been reinvested in new debentures.
The company expects this trend to continue," its latest
annual report said.</p>
