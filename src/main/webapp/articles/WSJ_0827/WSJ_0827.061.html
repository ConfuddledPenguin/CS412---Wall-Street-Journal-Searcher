	<h3>U.N. Hands Cuba a PR Coup</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Every five years the United Nations holds an international
conference "on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of
Offenders." The Eighth Congress, which starts today, was,
fortunately, not scheduled for Baghdad, but the site chosen,
Havana, is almost as objectionable. How this inappropriate
choice for a U.N. congress on criminal justice came about
illustrates the inability of the U.N. to live up to its own
principles.
   In 1988 Cuba let it be known that it wished to host the
congress in Havana; and in May 1989 the Social Committee of
the United Nations Economic and Social Council voted 43 to 2
to accept Cuba's invitation. Only the U.S. and Oman voted
against.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. State Department had tried unsuccessfully to
persuade the U.N. that holding the congress in Havana would
give Fidel Castro's denials of human-rights violations in
Cuba greater plausibility. Mr. Castro's loud insistence that
Cuba was a just society had become increasingly dubious after
reports from Amnesty International, from Americas Watch, from
the Human Rights Commission of the Economic and Social
Council itself, and from a special committee of the New York
City Bar Association that described injustice in Cuban courts
and mistreatment in Cuban prisons. Cuba's public relations
grew worse and worse as such prominent dissidents as Huber
Matos and Armando Valladares, released after decades in Cuban
prisons, detailed the cruel conditions of their own
confinements.</p>
<p>Consequently, Mr. Castro wanted the crime congress held in
Havana to give credibility to his claims of respecting the
U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. What with Third World
countries that didn't worry about Cuba's human-rights abuses,
Communist countries that supported Cuba automatically in 1989
although they wouldn't now, Latin American countries that
voted in a spirit of hemispheric solidarity, and countries
that simply wanted to get on with such trans-national crime
problems as drug trafficking and hijacking, Cuba had the
votes. Even such democratic countries as Canada, France and
Sweden agreed to the invitation.</p>
<p>Some Western nations felt that the Americans were still
fighting the Cold War and were not purely concerned about
human rights; others hoped that, with the world press in
Havana for the congress, Mr. Castro would make a flamboyant
gesture. Maybe he would announce the release of a few hundred
political prisoners during his welcoming address to a plenary
session of the congress or while sipping cocktails at a
reception for delegates. In 1984 he acceded to Jesse
Jackson's appeal for mercy and released 26 political
prisoners, among them Humberto Noble Alexander, imprisoned
for 22 years because his "propaganda" as a Seventh Day
Adventist offended officials. Mercy for political prisoners
will be welcome -- but the congress is about criminal
justice, not mercy.</p>
<p>Suppose that the U.S. had convinced the world that, as a
matter of principle, the Eighth U.N. Congress should not be
held in any country with major human rights abuses, be it
Cuba, Iraq or South Africa. Previous U.N. crime congresses
met in countries with freedom of speech, of religion, and of
association. Had the Eighth Congress been scheduled for such
a country, would it have been in a better position to work
for humane systems of criminal justice?</p>
<p>One difference is that delegates meeting in a country
where freedoms are guaranteed can listen to what the general
public says about crime and justice. Take the Fourth
Congress, which met in August 1965 in Stockholm while the
Watts riots dominated television news and not long after
Nelson Mandela was arrested, tried, and sentenced to
imprisonment in South Africa. Thurgood Marshall, then
solicitor general of the U.S., led the American delegation.
He and the other delegates from many countries presented
papers and exchanged ideas about the causes of crime and how
to rehabilitate offenders.</p>
<p>The Swedes were not impressed. Their newspapers and TV
programs criticized the presence of a South African
delegation led by the head of the prison system. And outside
the Folkethuset, where delegates deliberated, Swedish pickets
protested. The protest embarrassed the congress and may have
contributed to the adoption by the General Assembly the
following year of the "International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights" and in 1975 of a "Declaration on the
Protection of All Persons From Being Subjected to Torture and
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."</p>
<p>In Havana no pickets, no critical newspaper stories, no
public protest will be permitted to embarrass the congress.
Fidel Castro will see to that. In a country where Jehovah's
Witnesses commit a major crime by mimeographing religious
tracts (and are imprisoned for decades), what Cuban will dare
say that Havana is not the appropriate site for a conference
on criminal justice?</p>
