	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The amount of money invested in managed futures
funds has skyrocketed over the past decade, but regulation of
these funds hasn't kept pace.
   An estimated $12 billion is invested in managed futures
funds, which are pools of professionally managed capital
invested in futures markets, compared with $500 million in
1980, according to Managed Account Reports, Columbia, Md.,
which tracks the performance of managed futures fund
operators. Investments in such funds are now actively sold
through several major brokerage concerns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But such funds need far more oversight than they're
currently getting, many regulators say. Just how long and
ineffective the regulatory leash is was brought to light by
the collapse of Stotler Funds Inc. this month amid regulatory
charges of fraud and misuse of customer funds.</p>
<p>A routine audit of Stotler Funds' financial statements
three months ago by regulators revealed a questionable
transfer of about $5.5 million in customer money that formed
the basis for the fraud charges by regulators. But no action
was taken against the funds unit until after its
cash-strapped parent, Stotler Group Inc., defaulted on
commercial paper payments to one of the funds and other
lenders July 26. At that point Stotler Funds halted customer
redemptions from the fund.</p>
<p>The default might have been prevented, and no customer
money would have been imperiled, if regulators had forced
Stotler Funds to unwind the $5.5 million transfer when it was
discovered, futures industry officials said.</p>
<p>Stotler Funds hasn't said how much, if any, of the $5.5
million is recoverable. Regulators declined to comment on the
status of the funds.</p>
<p>In the wake of Stotler Funds' collapse, "we need to
explore the need for additional regulations on intracompany
transactions," said Daniel Roth, general counsel of the
National Futures Association, the industry-funded regulator
that audited the Stotler funds. The NFA audits financial
statements from all publicly offered managed futures funds.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Stotler
Group's defunct brokerage unit, Stotler & Co., in
administrative proceedings with, among other things, failing
to maintain sufficient capital since December. Those actions
follow CFTC charges July 31 that Stotler Funds violated
anti-fraud laws by effectively loaning $5.5 million to
Stotler Group from money that it told customers would be
invested in the futures markets.</p>
<p>This month, Stotler Group was forced into involuntary
bankruptcy-law proceedings by certain of the funds from which
the $5.5 million was borrowed. Further regulatory action
against the company and possibly its officers is expected.</p>
<p>The CFTC is the federal futures industry regulator. The
SEC had oversight responsibility for Stotler & Co.'s
government securities activities.</p>
<p>Regulators and futures industry officials said it is
impossible to know how widespread such possibly fraudulent
mishandling of customer money by futures fund mangers is
without more regulatory scrutiny. "Typically, you don't find
out about these things until they explode," said Morton
Baratz, editor of Managed Account Reports.</p>
<p>Lawrence Hite, a partner with Mint Investment Management
in New York, said Mint and most management companies maintain
internal auditing controls that are designed to prevent
fraudulent handling of customer funds. But these controls are
only as reliable as the management company's officials.</p>
<p>ELM Financial Inc. in Dallas was the trading adviser to
one of the Stotler funds. ELM invested the fund's money in
the futures markets, but it didn't know of the commercial
paper purchase until the day of the default, according to
ELM's founder, Ed Miller. Mr. Miller said he never received a
copy of the fund's audited financial report that noted the
commercial paper transaction. He said he resigned as adviser
to Stotler's Compass Futures Fund 10 minutes after learning
of the commercial paper transaction from Stotler Funds'
president, Thomas Kolter.</p>
<p>Troubles engulfing the Stotler companies reached to the
top of the Chicago Board of Trade this month, when its
chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, suddenly resigned as the
exchange's top elected official. Mr. Mahlmann also resigned
as chairman of Stotler Group and its collapsed futures
brokerage subsidiary, Stotler & Co.</p>
<p>In a letter to CBOT members, Mr. Mahlmann said he didn't
know about the problems at Stotler Funds. If he had, "I would
not have condoned them, and I would have taken action to
reverse them," he told the members. Mr. Mahlmann didn't
return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>In its complaint against Stotler Funds, the CFTC charged
the unit with fraudulently misusing money from hundreds of
investors in two commodity funds -- Compass Futures Funds and
Advanced Portfolio Management L.P. The federal futures
industry regulator charged that Stotler Funds late last year
fraudulently loaned $5.5 million from the two funds that was
earmarked for investment in the futures markets to Stotler
Group.</p>
<p>When the National Futures Association queried Stotler
Funds about the loans in May, the association said the loans
"may be in violation of the pools' respective disclosure
documents." The Compass funds disclosure document
"specifically disallows such lending," the association said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kolter, Stotler Funds' president, responded the
following week by telling the association that investors were
aware of the transactions. Investors in Compass Futures Fund
had been told of the loan to Stotler Group in a note in the
fund's annual report, which was audited by accountants
Coopers & Lybrand, Mr. Kolter said. The National Futures
Association received the audited report for 1989 in late
March of this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Kolter didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>A senior NFA official insisted that the regulator didn't
drop its investigation of Stotler because of Mr. Kolter's
letter. "But we did put it on the back burner" because of the
Coopers & Lybrand imprimatur, he said. A Coopers & Lybrand
spokesman declined to comment on the audit of the Stotler
funds.</p>
<p>After failing to secure an emergency cash infusion of $10
million in late July, Stotler Group defaulted on $750,000 in
commercial paper payments, $260,000 of which is owed Compass
Futures Fund. Compass loaned a total of about $4.5 million to
Stotler Group via the purchase of its commercial paper.
Advanced Portfolio Management loaned Stotler Group $1 million
in the form of a demand note.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Gold</p>
<p>The rally triggered by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
sparked a global wave of forward selling by producers that
has stifled price advances. But that selling may have peaked.</p>
<p>"Before the crisis began, Australia, for example, had
already sold about 60% of its production for two years ahead
at an average price of 600 Australian dollars (then about
US$460) an ounce," says Don Mackay-Coghill, chief executive
officer of Gold Corp. of Australia, a government-owned
concern that sells Australia's legal-tender precious metal
coins. "When you consider that it cost between A$300 and
A$350 (an ounce) to mine the gold, producers were very happy
with the profit."</p>
<p>Producers in the Soviet Union, South Africa and even the
U.S. sold gold this way when the price rose above $400 an
ounce, Mr. Mackay-Coghill says. As a result, he says, gold
prices have advanced about 20% during the recent rally and
the market has absorbed tremendous selling without breaking.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom now holds that if there is a
diplomatic settlement of the Mideast crisis, gold will drop
sharply, perhaps to around $350, Mr. Mackay-Coghill says.
However, "I don't agree," he says. "I think the decline will
amount to $15 to $20 or to $25 at the most."</p>
<p>The sharp rise in oil prices that is just starting to work
its way through world economies will have an inflationary
impact that will create a strong underpinning for gold
prices, he says.</p>
<p>Grains and Soybeans</p>
<p>Grain futures prices, inflated by concern about the
numerous ways higher petroleum prices will hurt farmers, may
drift downward this week if the Mideast crisis remains
stalemated, analysts said. The correction is not likely to be
sharp, however, because fundamentals in soybeans, corn and
wheat remain strong.</p>
<p>Weather in the Mississippi valley growing region has been
hot and dry throughout August, and farmers in Brazil are
suffering from a host of financial problems. Demand,
meanwhile, remains strong for soybeans and other grains.</p>
<p>Last week, "a lot of people were talking about making war,
and the markets reacted accordingly," said Daniel Basse,
director of market research for Ag-Resource Co., Chicago.
This week the markets are likely to remain focused on the
Mideast, and if it remains relatively quiet, prices may ease.</p>
<p>Cocoa</p>
<p>Futures prices boomed Friday, with the December contract
ending $158 a metric ton higher at $1,381. But the rally
isn't expected to continue this week.</p>
<p>According to analysts, there were no new fundamental
developments to account for the strong buying. Demand
developed in London early in the day as traders bought
contracts because that market will be closed for a holiday
today.</p>
<p>The New York market was described by one analyst as
speculative and technical. Buying by traders who had sold
short in anticipation of falling prices caused the December
contract to rally above $1,250 and then $1,300, two key
resistance levels. At those points, a large number of buy
orders were activated, pushing prices even higher.</p>
<p>However, one analyst said, "In the absence of fresh
fundamental factors, I don't think the rally can continue for
more than a day or two at the most."</p>
