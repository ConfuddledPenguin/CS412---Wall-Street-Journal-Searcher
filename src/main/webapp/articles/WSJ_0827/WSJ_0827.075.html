	<p class="article-leader">AN AUG. 17 ARTICLE reported incorrectly that a lawyer for
Nynex Corp. testified in a rate case in New York that New
York Telephone Co.'s general counsel John Clarke was one of
several Nynex officials who knew about bawdy parties in
Florida attended by Nynex purchasing personnel and suppliers.
In fact, the lawyer testified that company investigators had
been told that Mr. Clarke might have received a report of the
1985-86 investigation that mentioned the gatherings, known as
the perverts conventions. Mr. Clarke has since stated that he
never received a copy of the investigation report, nor was he
ever apprised of its contents.
