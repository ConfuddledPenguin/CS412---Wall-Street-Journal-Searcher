	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Bush
administration was lobbying hard to kill a bill that would
impose sanctions on Baghdad in an effort to curb its
aggressive, bullying behavior.
   Rep. Howard Berman (D., Calif.) the author of the
sanctions measure, says that in four telephone calls -- two
from senior State Department officials and two from National
Security Council aides -- the administration argued for time,
saying it was "reviewing policy" towards Iraq. At that point,
Iraq already had amassed troops on its border with Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the officials must have suspected that the time for
review was over. They confided to Rep. Berman that they were
reluctant to oppose his bill publicly. Indeed, when Rep.
Berman rejected their arguments and the House Foreign Affairs
Committee worked on the bill the next day, administration
officials didn't even show up.</p>
<p>Their unwillingness to slap Iraq on the wrist culminated a
long history of mild responses by the Reagan and Bush
administrations to increasingly troublesome actions by
Baghdad, including the poison-gas killings of hundreds of
Kurdish civilians, the hanging of a British journalist,
attempts to import nuclear-weapons technology illegally,
escalation of anti-U.S. rhetoric and overt blackmail of its
neighbors.</p>
<p>The initial U.S. passivity contrasts sharply with
President Bush's decisive military response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, which has won support from virtually all
the world's major nations. Mr. Bush displayed a similar
pattern when he initially reacted passively to mounting
provocations by Panama's erstwhile dictator Manuel Noriega,
before sending in U.S. forces to topple him.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say whether a tougher U.S. stance
earlier this year would have altered the behavior of Saddam
Hussein, Iraq's president. But some Mideast experts contend
that an early, clear signal of the U.S.'s willingness to use
force to protect its interests might have averted the current
showdown.</p>
<p>"I think it's possible that we might have dissuaded Saddam
from making the overt military move," says William Quandt, a
Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution. "He
might have settled for the bullying and the blackmail. He's a
gambler but he's not crazy."</p>
<p>Laurie Mylroie, a fellow at Harvard's Center for Middle
East Studies, says: "Particularly when Saddam Hussein was
threatening Kuwait earlier and building up his forces, if
Bush had spoken up more strongly and said this could mean
war, it might have been an effective deterrent."</p>
<p>Other analysts disagree, arguing that the U.S. attempt to
establish a working relationship with Iraq was worth the
effort because Iraq is a regional power. "It was just too
important to ignore," says James Placke, a former State
Department official who dealt with the Persian Gulf region
during the Reagan administration.</p>
<p>The roots of the U.S. policy toward Iraq trace back to the
1979 Iranian revolution. U.S. officials saw Baghdad as a
bulwark against a wave of Iranian-inspired Islamic
fundamentalism that threatened to topple Mideast regimes and
jeopardize the free flow of oil to the West. As a result,
during the Iran-Iraq war the U.S. licensed the export of
considerable amounts of militarily applicable technology to
Iraq, including aircraft parts and personal computers. And,
U.S. officials say, Washington privately encouraged France to
arm Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The U.S. also gave Iraq $4 billion in agriculture credits,
mainly to foster a market for U.S. products. Indeed, over the
last few years, when the White House dragged its heels on
sanctions, it had the support of lawmakers from grain states.
In July, when the Senate was debating a sanctions bill, Sen.
John Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, which until recently
shipped rice to Iraq, said, "I cannot imagine this Congress .
. . voting to take food out of the mouths of hungry children
and starving women because we do not like the leader of their
country."</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein didn't repay the U.S. In August 1988, a
month after Iraq's war with Iran ended, Baghdad was shipping
weapons into Lebanon and working against U.S. peace efforts
there. Last February, the Iraqi dictator said it was time to
end the U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf. At an Arab
summit last spring, he bluntly demanded that the oil-rich
states provide him $12 billion to help rebuild his economy
and that they forgive some $70 billion he already owed. Then,
last month he bullied the Gulf states into raising the price
of oil.</p>
<p>"We disregarded every principle we had when it came to
dealing with Saddam Hussein," Rep. Berman asserts. "It isn't
surprising that the Western world's track record over the
last ten years led him to believe that he could march into
Kuwait without there being any significant response."</p>
