	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The government lowered its 1990 gross
domestic product growth estimate to 2.5% from 3%, and
increased its estimate for this year's inflation rate to 9.5%
from 8.5%.
   An official said that the revisions were largely
influenced by the crisis in the Persian Gulf, but that the
weaker trends were in place even before Iraq seized Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He declined to break down GDP growth on a quarterly basis,
but indicated that while first-quarter growth was close to
zero, GDP in the second quarter was slightly better. Growth
is expected to peak in the current quarter, before the full
economic effects of higher oil prices work their way through
the economy.</p>
