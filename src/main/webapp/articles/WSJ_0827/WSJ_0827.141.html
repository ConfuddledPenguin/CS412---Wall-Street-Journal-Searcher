	<p class="article-leader">A state judge ruled that a British rock band and CBS
Records are not to blame for the actions of two young men who
shot themselves after listening to alleged hidden messages in
heavy metal music.
   In a ruling Friday, Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehead
of Reno, Nev., found that hidden words do exist in the music
but that the band had not placed them there intentionally.
And Judge Whitehead ruled that the families of the two men
failed to prove that the subliminal messages caused the
youths' behavior.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Judge Whitehead ordered CBS to pay $40,000 to
the plaintiffs' attorneys because the company did not
properly comply with a court order to supply the original
master tape of the album.</p>
<p>The case was closely watched because some legal experts
feared that a ruling against CBS would open up media
companies and artists to liability concerning possible hidden
messages in their work.</p>
<p>Shortly before Christmas 1985, Raymond Belknap and James
Vance shot themselves with a 12-gauge shotgun after drinking
beer and listening to "Stained Class," an album by the band
Judas Priest. Mr. Belknap, 18 years old, died instantly. Mr.
Vance, 20, survived the shooting but died three years later.</p>
<p>The men's families contended in a lawsuit that subliminal
messages in the music induced their sons to shoot themselves
and that the band, CBS Records, which distributed the album,
and CBS Inc. bore responsibility for the tragedy.</p>
<p>The suit is part of a growing trend of cases in which
plaintiffs attempt to spread the responsibility for tragic
events caused by their own behavior. Traditionally the makers
of albums, unlike the makers of products such as power lawn
mowers or swimming pools, have been shielded from such suits
by the First Amendment. But in a pre-trial ruling, Judge
Whitehead found that subliminal messages aren't protected by
the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Kenneth McKenna, a Reno lawyer representing the families,
said that the case had been hampered by a lack of scientific
studies on the effect of subliminal messages on human
behavior but should nevertheless send a signal to the music
industry.</p>
<p>"We've made major inroads with this decision. The judge
ruled that subliminal messages do in fact exist on this
recording and probably other heavy metal recordings. We're
two-thirds of the way to victory," Mr. McKenna said. He said
his clients had not decided yet whether to appeal.</p>
<p>CBS had argued that no subliminal messages exist on the
album and that Mr. Belknap and Mr. Vance were troubled youths
who abused drugs and alcohol and whose behavior wasn't
connected to the music.</p>
<p>In the decision, Judge Whitehead wrote that the subliminal
message "do it" appeared throughout the album but that it was
the result of a chance combination of sounds. But Judge
Whitehead wrote that after hearing all the evidence, he
believed "that the position taken by the plaintiffs in this
action was an arguable one."</p>
<p>Gail Edwin, a CBS in-house lawyer, said the judge's
finding that there was no proof of intentional hidden
messages would dissuade other people from bringing such
suits. She said the company is still reviewing whether to
appeal the $40,000 in sanctions and said CBS "did everything
appropriate at all times."</p>
<p>But Ben B. Mills Jr., who is representing plaintiffs in
two similar suits pending against the singer Ozzy Osbourne,
said the ruling will help his cases. "We've been fighting the
issue of whether subliminals exist all along. We'll be
building on this ruling," said Mr. Mills of Fitzgerald, Ga.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some experts say it will be difficult for
plaintiffs to prove that hidden messages cause harmful
behavior. "There is still no scientific evidence that human
behavior is affected by such messages," says Anthony
Greenwald, a professor of psychology at the University of
Washington who studied commercially available audiotape
programs that claimed to improve memory or increase
self-esteem through subliminal messages.</p>
<p>Media lawyers said they are troubled by Judge Whitehead's
ruling that subliminal messages are not protected by the
First Amendment.</p>
<p>"Once we start saying that certain types of messages are
off-limits in terms of First Amendment protection, we start
down a very treacherous road," said Floyd Abrams of the New
York firm Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, a media defense lawyer.</p>

<p>A LAW FIRM PARTNER in New Jersey is indicted on
racketeering charges.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury has indicted Richard P. Console, a
senior partner with the Berlin, N.J., law firm of Console,
Marmero & Curcio, on charges of violating the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. He allegedly
participated in a scheme to defraud insurance companies by
fabricating medical bills in personal-injury cases.</p>
<p>Kathleen Baldwin Sabath, a paralegal with the firm, also
was charged in the RICO and fraud scheme.</p>
<p>Mr. Console was charged on 11 counts of fraud and
racketeering. Ms. Sabath was charged on 12 counts, including
one alleged lying to a grand jury.</p>
<p>Mr. Console's attorney, Stephen Dunbar, said he assumes
Mr. Console will plead not guilty when he is arraigned in
September. "He is innocent of all charges," Mr. Dunbar said.</p>
<p>Charles Nugent, Ms. Sabath's attorney, said his client
will be vindicated. "She is merely a secretary in the
office," he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Newark said
the indictment by a Camden, N.J., grand jury takes precedence
over related indictments filed last year that were "the first
RICO charge that identified a law firm and a medical office
as a RICO enterprise."</p>
<p>In 1989, two other partners of Console Marmero;
osteopathic physician Morton Markoff of Cherry Hill; the law
firm's administrator; and a medical office employee were
indicted.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. attorney's office, alleged all the
defendants defrauded 26 insurance companies by inflating
medical costs in personal-injury cases, creating false
medical bills, and backdating treatment records.</p>
<p>Partner Philip J. Livolsi, one of the defendants charged
last year, has pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering.
Mr. Livolsi is cooperating with prosecutors and has agreed to
forfeit his 20% interest in the law firm.</p>
<p>The law firm said that the indictments were a "concerted
campaign to subdue or eliminate a law firm which has
successfully . . . vigorously and vigilantly defended the
legal and civil rights of its clients."</p>

<p>INDICTED YEN TRADER switches Chicago law firms.</p>
<p>An indicted currency futures trader fired his attorneys
from 275-lawyer Jenner & Block over what he thought were
exorbitant fees and the apparent unwillingness of the law
firm partner he originally retained to try the case, three
individuals familiar with the case said.</p>
<p>Yen trader John M. Baker Jr., who is among 21 yen traders
indicted for alleged illegal trading practices at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, told U.S. District Judge William T. Hart
last week that Joseph J. Duffy of 205-lawyer Schiff, Hardin &
Waite would represent him during the trial, scheduled to
begin Sept. 5. Mr. Baker was named in more than 100 of the
393 counts in the indictment against the traders.</p>
<p>"I fired Jenner & Block due to circumstances," Mr. Baker
told the judge at a hearing. "I don't wish Jenner & Block to
be my attorney any more." Mr. Baker has paid Jenner & Block
$250,000 in legal fees and was facing about $500,000 more in
fees for the law firm's trial work, the three individuals
said.</p>
<p>When the indictments against the traders were announced a
year ago by former U.S. attorney Anton R. Valukas, now a
partner at Jenner & Block, Mr. Baker hired partner Thomas P.
Sullivan. When Mr. Sullivan recently indicated that he would
not try the case himself, Mr. Baker began looking for another
lawyer, the people familiar with the case said.</p>
<p>The judge ordered Jenner & Block to assist Mr. Duffy in
his trial preparation and refused to postpone the trial date.</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan wouldn't comment. Mr. Duffy said only that
Mr. Baker "just decided he wanted new counsel." Mr. Baker
couldn't be reached.</p>

<p>EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO pleads guilty to money-laundering.</p>
<p>Mr. Martinez, charged with laundering more than $1 billion
in Colombian drug money, made the plea at an early-morning
hearing that was unpublicized for security reasons. Before
U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley of Atlanta, Mr.
Martinez pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the Medellin
cartel in the laundering of money through an organization
called La Mina, meaning "the mine."</p>
<p>Mr. Martinez, who was extradited to the U.S. from Colombia
last fall, faces a maximum sentence of 30 years without
parole.</p>

<p>FORMER LAWYER SENTENCED in Pittsburgh for stealing from
clients.</p>
<p>Charles M. Thorp III, who had losses of upward of $20
million on the options market, was sentenced by a federal
judge in Pittsburgh to 57 months in prison for stealing about
$2.6 million from clients.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond also ordered Mr.
Thorp, whose thefts occurred from 1982 to 1989, to pay
restitution to his former clients. The 50-year-old Mr. Thorp
will remain under court supervision for three years after his
release, the judge ruled.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp pleaded guilty in June to charges of interstate
transportation related to sending stolen cash and bonds to
Boston and New York and bank fraud related to a $400,000 loan
he obtained from Pittsburgh National Bank by using a client's
name and credit. Pittsburgh National is a unit of PNC
Financial Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp is the grandson of the founder of one of
Pittsburgh's prestigious law firms.</p>
