	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Laura Ashley PLC, a clothing and home
furnishings concern, said its chief executive officer, John
James, will resign on Saturday.
   A spokesman said that Mr. James's departure was amicable,
and that the executive's plans weren't known.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. James's post will be assumed temporarily by Mike
Smith, chairman of Laura Ashley's British retail operations.
Laura Ashley said it intends to seek a successor from outside
the company.</p>
<p>Laura Ashley, which expanded rapidly overseas in the past
decade, had a #4.6 million ($9 million) pretax loss in the
year ended Jan. 27, a reversal from year-earlier pretax
profit of #20.3 million, despite an 18% rise in sales to
#296.6 million.</p>
<p>The company experienced a sharp decline in several sectors
of its important domestic and U.S. markets, and introduced a
line of furniture in Britain just as the local housing market
entered a slump.</p>
<p>Mr. James, who joined Laura Ashley in 1974 when its sales
stood at #2 million a year, was widely criticized by analysts
as the fortunes of the company soured in the past year. "The
business has now outgrown him," said Richard Ratner of Carr
Kitcat & Aitken, a London stockbrokerage firm.</p>
