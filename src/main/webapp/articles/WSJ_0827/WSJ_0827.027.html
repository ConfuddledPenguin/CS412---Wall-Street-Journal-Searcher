	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- Rosenthal AG of West Germany, a porcelain
products maker, said it expects to resume paying annual cash
dividends beginning for 1990, after omitting the 1989 payout.
It last paid five marks ($3.23) a share for 1988.
   In February, Rosenthal decided to forgo a dividend for
1989, to channel fresh cash to beef up the capital base of
the Johan Haviland China Corp. subsidiary in the U.S. "We are
confident that for 1990 we can again pay a satisfactory
dividend," the company said, but it didn't mention a sum.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dividend probably will be declared in early 1991.</p>
