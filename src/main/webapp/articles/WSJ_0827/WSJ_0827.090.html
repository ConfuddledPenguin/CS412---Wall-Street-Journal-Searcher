	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- This was to be the summer of muscle-bound
macho in the movie business. Hollywood's big studios served
up a passel of big-budget pictures packed with pyrotechnics,
violent special effects, and bicep-flexing actors working for
eight-figure salaries.
   But the he-man likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce
Willis are getting beat up at the box office by a sappy
little love story called "Ghost." This past weekend, the
Paramount Pictures film grossed another $7.8 million to hit
$112 million in ticket sales in 45 days, passing "Die Hard
2." By the end of this week, "Ghost" could surpass "Total
Recall" as the summer's top grosser, and it may yet outsell
"Pretty Woman" as the No. 1 film of the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Ghost" is an unlikely success story that may offer a
lesson to a business obsessed with superstar salaries and
blow-'em-up stunts: Instead of going for the gut, making a
blatantly sentimental appeal to the heart can be just as
effective. And cheaper.</p>
<p>The rest of Hollywood is taking note. Just as this
summer's overabundance of action flicks followed,
lemming-like, in the path of last summer's huge hit,
"Batman," next summer may be filled with films modeled after
"Ghost." "Every time a movie works, people tend to gravitate
toward the subject matter that made it work," says Barry
London, co-president of Paramount's motion picture group.</p>
<p>"Ghost" tells the story of a regular Joe who is killed in
a mugging and finds himself hanging around, invisible to the
living, trying to console and protect his bereaved girlfriend
and solve his own murder.</p>
<p>Few people can identify personally with Mr. Willis
outgunning terrorists in "Die Hard 2," or with Mr.
Schwarzenegger knocking off adversaries by the dozen on
planet Mars in "Total Recall." But many folks can hope for
life after death and wish for one more chance to say goodbye
to someone they love, the themes at play in "Ghost."</p>
<p>"What was wonderful about it is it touches an emotional
port in people," says Lawrence Resnick, a clinical
psychologist who went with his wife, Elizabeth, to see
"Ghost" on his 41st birthday last week. He was moved to
tears. "It helps people realize it's so important to
appreciate what we have," he says.</p>
<p>Even if "Ghost" doesn't finish No. 1 at the box office, it
may be the most profitable picture of the year. The movie is
likely to hit $130 million in North American ticket sales by
the end of the summer season after Memorial Day, and it could
exceed $165 million by the fall, projects Hollywood Reporter
film analyst Martin Grove. The studio, a unit of Paramount
Communications Inc., gets about half, plus additional revenue
when the film is released overseas and on cable, videotape
and network television.</p>
<p>The movie was made for less than $20 million, only
one-third the cost of swaggering blockbusters "Total Recall"
and "Die Hard 2" and about half the cost of Paramount's two
big action films of the summer, the Tom Cruise vehicle "Days
of Thunder" and the Eddie Murphy epic "Another 48 HRS."
Instead of spending $10 million or more for a heavyweight
star, Paramount used three actors with uneven records at the
box office: Patrick Swayze, Whoopi Goldberg and Demi Moore.</p>
<p>Rather than pay a million-plus for a "spec" script sold in
a bidding war, Paramount developed the story in-house with
writer Bruce Joel Rubin, a mystical sort who has spent time
in a Tibetan monastery. (The studio already has signed him to
direct his first feature.) Though Mr. Rubin's story is so
sweetly sentimental as to border on the hokey, the studio
tapped as director Jerry Zucker, an oddball writer better
known for such parodies as "Airplane]" and "Top Secret." (In
the latter, he filmed a cow that was wearing boots and
sporting painted polka dots.)</p>
<p>"Summer seems to be a time when the studios all want to
bring out their big guns," says Mr. Zucker, interviewed by
phone from a film festival in Norway, where "Ghost" is about
to be released. "A lot of times big guns are the pictures
that have big budgets, big names, lots of explosions, films
that are visually extravagant." But in "Ghost," he played
down the special effects -- neat stuff like shots from Mr.
Swayze's point of view, showing the cellular insides of
people as they passed through him -- to focus on the story
and humor.</p>
<p>"Ghost" spoofs spooks as Mr. Swayze, rookie poltergeist,
learns the ins and outs of the afterlife. Trying to make
contact with his girlfriend, he spots a storefront sign,
"Contact the Dearly Departed for $20," and hooks up with a
fake psychic played by Ms. Goldberg. When she refuses to
help, he haunts her bedroom late at night, singing "I'm Henry
the Eighth I Am" in heavy cockney.</p>
<p>"Ghost," like "Pretty Woman," benefited by appealing to
people age 25-plus and women, in particular, in a market
crowded with action pictures aimed at young males.</p>
<p>"Everyone wanted to have the next `Batman,' because the
upside was so high," says Alan Kassan, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley Co. "Batman" grossed $250 million last year, but no
film has come close this season. The willingness of teen-age
boys and 18-to-25-year-old men to see a hot film again and
again is critical to a huge box office, but their income is
limited, and this summer they had to stretch it over too many
pictures.</p>
<p>To exploit the glut of macho movies, Paramount bumped up
the release date for "Ghost" by two weeks, to July 13. Then
it sold the film's soft side, sending critics fancy little
bags filled with a perfume sample, a split of French
champagne, a lace handkerchief, and a film poster and note
promoting the film. Television and print ads went heavy on
the romance, and by June 30, the studio had already spent
close to $3 million on TV spots, according to Arbitron Co.'s
Broadcast Advertiser Reports.</p>
<p>Despite the film's success, Hollywood will continue to
churn out action/adventure fare because it can pay so well.
"Total Recall," from Carolco Pictures Inc., and "Die Hard 2,"
from Fox Inc.'s Twentieth Century Fox, could take in $160
million apiece in studio revenues against expenses of about
$100 million each, a profit margin approaching 40%, Mr.
Kassan estimates.</p>
<p>Paramount itself has fared less well with Tom Cruise in a
race car and with Eddie Murphy out of jail, albeit the
windfall from "Ghost" could more than offset any
disappointments. Mr. Cruise's "Days of Thunder" cost $75
million to make and market, by some estimates, but had
brought in less than $40 million in revenue to the studio in
54 days. "Another 48 HRS." cost an estimated $62 million to
produce and release, with Paramount's share of receipts
coming to about $40 million in 73 days.</p>
