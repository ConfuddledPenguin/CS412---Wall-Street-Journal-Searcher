	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- There's a gusher of an oil play inside Fund
American Cos., better known as the parent of Fireman's Fund
Insurance.
   Fund American, which was called Fireman's Fund Corp. until
last December, agreed a few weeks ago to sell its insurance
operations to the West German insurer Allianz for $3.3
billion. Fund American, based in Greenwich, Conn., will
remain a publicly traded company, and its first move will be
to buy back its former insurance unit's stockholdings for
$2.2 billion, which was the market value of the portfolio on
May 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In effect, Fund American will be transformed into a
publicly traded "closed-end" investment company. Its value
will depend, more than anything else, on its stock portfolio,
not on the insurance business.</p>
<p>As it happens, this stock portfolio is positioned squarely
in the oil patch, thanks to money manager Bob Bruce's
one-time hunch that America's thirst for oil and the
Mideast's volatile politics would someday combine to drive
energy prices back up. About 66% of the portfolio is invested
in energy-related issues. These include big stakes in
Freeport-McMoRan, Louisiana Land & Exploration and British
Petroleum.</p>
<p>The Allianz agreement initially drove Fund American's
stock price to a new high of 51 3/4, prompting many Wall
Street insurance analysts to advise clients to unload their
shares. The stock has since declined to 46 3/4. Now analysts
say Fund American is beginning to look attractive, because
its shares are trading at a significant discount to the value
of the oil-rich fistful of stocks in the portfolio.</p>
<p>If the insurance unit had been sold as of last Monday,
says Ira Malis at Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore, the
remaining company would have had a net asset value of roughly
$65.15 a share. Based on his estimate, Fund American shares
last Friday were selling at a 28% discount to the company's
worth, known in Wall Street jargon as the net asset value.
Fund American will say only that the transaction should cause
its book value to exceed $60 a share, based on its financial
position as of last May 31.</p>
<p>It is common for a closed-end fund to trade at a discount
to the value of the stocks it holds, especially after brokers
stop pushing a fund's initial offering. But a 29% discount is
unusually big.</p>
<p>Closed-end funds that invest chiefly in U.S. companies are
trading at about a 15% discount to their net asset value,
according to Richard Barone of Maxus Investment Group,
Cleveland, who follows closed-end funds. In the past 20
years, he says, trading discounts for closed-end funds have
ranged from about 25% in the mid-1970s to about 10% just
before the October 1987 stock market crash. Based on these
historical ranges, investors could reasonably expect Fund
American shares to close some of the gap.</p>
<p>Moreover, the portfolio value itself could increase if oil
prices -- and energy stocks -- resume the sharp rise that
stalled last week. Mr. Malis of Alex. Brown calculates that
the value of Fund American's portfolio increased about $130
million, or 6.4%, from June 30 to last Monday, a period in
which the overall stock market, as measured by the Standard &
Poor's 500 index, fell 8.2%.</p>
<p>A number of factors, however, could diminish Fund
American's longer-term value. The resulting uncertainty
accounts for at least some of the discount built into the
stock's price, analysts say.</p>
<p>For one thing, there is the timing of Allianz's purchase
of Fireman's Fund. The sale is expected to close early next
year, but Fund American shareholders and insurance regulators
in 13 states must first approve the deal. There shouldn't be
much trouble in obtaining the approvals, but such procedures
often are subject to delay. Fund American shareholders aren't
expected to receive proxy materials explaining the
transaction in detail until October.</p>
<p>Fund American has said that, after the sale is completed,
it plans to pay out more than $800 million to holders of
common shares, either through a self-tender offer or a cash
distribution. This prospect raises another uncertainty.
Tax-paying shareholders, for example, might prefer a stock
buy-back that would increase the market value of their shares
without forcing them to accept taxable income. But tax-exempt
holders, such as pension funds, might prefer a cash
distribution that they could reinvest. (The rest of Fund
American's net cash proceeds of $1.1 billion from the sale
will be used to redeem a closely held preferred stock issue
for $434 million.)</p>
<p>Afterward, Fund American plans to liquidate its remaining
assets "in an orderly fashion" over the next three to five
years. Or, in the words of Chairman Jack Byrne, "We're going
to be a melting ice cube."</p>
<p>But before drinking deeply of that cool water, investors
should know about a few impurities. One, coincidentally, is
known as liquidity. Fund American's portfolio has several big
positions in certain energy stocks and partnerships that
don't trade very actively and could be tough to sell without
depressing the price.</p>
<p>Mr. Malis cites Permian Basin Royalty Trust as an example.
Fund American holds 1.3 million shares, but on Friday, only
11,700 traded, a typical daily volume. Another big holding is
a 24% stake in MBIA, a municipal-bond insurance company owned
mostly by other big insurers. Only about 15% of MBIA's shares
are in public hands.</p>
<p>"How do they get out of some of these large, illiquid
assets?" Mr. Malis says.</p>
<p>Executives of Fund American won't discuss their plans
until after the proxy materials are filed. But the company
has said it is considering, among other things, block sales
of securities, distribution of assets, formation of
partnerships or formation of a registered investment company.</p>
<p>Capital gains taxes could complicate the liquidation. Fund
American has said that it expects to pay "little or no income
taxes" on the sale of Fireman's Fund, but hasn't indicated
how the gains in its stock portfolio will be handled.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the business that analysts view as the
real clunker in Fund American's portfolio, Fireman's Fund
Mortgage Corp. A mortgage banking company that Fund American
bought from Manufacturers Hanover Trust in 1986 for $260
million, the unit now is valued at about $250 million. Though
the mortgage unit earned only about $7 million last year,
Fund American has led analysts to believe that it will earn
$12 million to $13 million this year.</p>
<p>In announcing the sale of Fireman's Fund to Allianz, Fund
American said it would consider future acquisitions of
"financial service companies to augment the activities of the
mortgage company." Skeptics believe that this statement, and
the prospect that Fund American may try to expand its way out
of a blunder into the mortgage business, is holding down the
stock's price.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, Chairman Byrne is given high marks for
astute management and a tight focus on delivering value to
shareholders, though at least one of his decisions has proved
unfortunate. The company's name change from Fireman's Fund
Corp. to Fund American last December occurred just a few
months before a discount-buying club named FundAmerica Inc.
burst into the news. The club, whose founder was arrested on
fraud charges, hired the well-known doomsday investment
strategist Howard Ruff and then entered bankruptcy-law
proceedings. Fund American officials now find themselves
continually reassuring investors that the company isn't
related in any way to the alleged pyramid scheme.</p>
