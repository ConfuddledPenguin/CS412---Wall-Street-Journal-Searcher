	<p class="article-leader">Several top officials at Nynex Corp. knew about parties
involving company suppliers and Nynex purchasing officials
well before informants prompted the company to investigate
the annual gatherings, according to testimony in a New York
rate case.
   Charles Many, head of Nynex Mobile Communications Co. and
Joseph Farina, who headed Nynex Properties, were aware of the
Florida gatherings because they were friends of Lawrence
Friedman, the Nynex Materiel Enterprises vice president who
organized them, an attorney for Nynex testified at a
rate-case hearing in Albany, N.Y. At issue in the rate case
are allegations that suppliers at the gatherings received
favored treatment in the granting of Nynex contracts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He also testified that Raymond Burke, Nynex's executive
vice president and general counsel, and John Clarke, New York
Telephone's general counsel, knew about the gatherings from a
1985 investigation into Mr. Friedman's partial ownership of a
company that had done business with Nynex. That
investigation, however, didn't focus on the gatherings, which
were believed to be small, private parties held on employees'
own time, a Nynex spokesman said.</p>
<p>Guy Miller Struve, a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell who
led the 1988 investigation, testified that interviews in the
investigation also indicated that former Nynex Chairman
Delbert C. Staley and Robert Eckenrode, Nynex's vice
chairman, were also aware of the gatherings. But
investigators didn't pursue whether Messrs. Staley or
Eckenrode knew about weeklong parties, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The 1988 investigation led to the firing of Mr. Friedman
and another Nynex purchasing official as well as disciplinary
action against seven other employees who attended the
gatherings. Nynex retained Davis Polk after receiving
anonymous allegations about the gatherings.</p>
<p>Nynex's New York Telephone unit, which is seeking a $1.4
billion rate increase over three years, said its president,
Fred Salerno, "had no knowledge of the alleged improprieties"
at the Florida gatherings. The statement followed testimony
Wednesday that Mr. Salerno may have been invited to one of
the gatherings and had advised an employee against attending.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>AN AUG. 17 ARTICLE reported incorrectly that a lawyer for
Nynex Corp. testified in a rate case in New York that New
York Telephone Co.'s general counsel John Clarke was one of
several Nynex officials who knew about bawdy parties in
Florida attended by Nynex purchasing personnel and suppliers.
In fact, the lawyer testified that company investigators had
been told that Mr. Clarke might have received a report of the
1985-86 investigation that mentioned the gatherings, known as
the perverts conventions. Mr. Clarke has since stated that he
never received a copy of the investigation report, nor was he
ever apprised of its contents.</p>
