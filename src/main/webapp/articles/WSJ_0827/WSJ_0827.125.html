	<p class="article-leader">A.O. Smith Corp. said it resumed a stock-repurchase
program which had been suspended in June 1989.
   The remaining authorization allows the Milwaukee-based
automotive-equipment company to buy back up to $7.5 million
of its common and convertible exchangeable preferred shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A growing number of companies have opted to either dust
off old share-repurchase plans, or authorize new buy-backs,
in response to the stock market's recent sharp downturn.</p>
