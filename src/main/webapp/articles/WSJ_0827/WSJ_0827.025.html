	<p class="article-leader">CANBERRA -- Commonwealth Bank Corp. of Australia,
currently 100% owned by the federal government, will issue
shares to selected investors and use the funds to acquire
State Bank of Victoria, the government announced.
   It said the acquisition of State Bank of Victoria for 1.6
billion Australian dollars (US$1.33 billion) will make
Commonwealth Bank the third-biggest in Australia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>State Bank of Victoria, which is owned by the Victoria
state government, was offered for sale because its investment
banking unit, Tricontinental Holdings Ltd., incurred losses
and huge bad debts over recent years. The state government
couldn't afford to cover the losses and settle
Tricontinental's debts without selling the bank.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank's acquisition doesn't include
Tricontinental.</p>
<p>Paul Keating, Australia's treasurer, said State Bank of
Victoria's debt of A$2.7 billion would have extinguished its
entire capital base of $A1.6 billion. That could have had
implications for the stability of Australia's financial
system unless State Bank of Victoria was acquired by a
stronger bank, he suggested at a news conference.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating took the opportunity presented by the bank's
problem to pursue his aim of selling at least parts of
government businesses to reduce public-sector debt. Partial
privatization of government businesses is supported by some
members of the ruling Labor Party, including Mr. Keating and
Prime Minister Bob Hawke, but bitterly opposed by the party's
left-wing faction, in particular.</p>
<p>Labor Party officials already had called a meeting for
Sept. 24 to decide whether the government can privatize parts
of its telecommunications concerns and airlines, which need
capital injections.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating said Sunday that Commonwealth Bank "cannot
finance the acquisition from its existing capital base, and
the (federal) government isn't in a position to augment that
capital base from its budget.</p>
<p>"Therefore, the equity base of Commonwealth Bank will need
to be augmented with private capital roughly equivalent to
about 30% of the Commonwealth Bank's existing capital base,"
he said.</p>
<p>The federal government will retain control of Commonwealth
Bank. Australian investment institutions such as pension
funds are likely to invest in Commonwealth Bank, but other
banks can't buy shares in the bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating said the acquisition doesn't have any
implications for the federal government's budget, announced
last week, or the overall public-sector borrowing requirement
that he plans to keep in balance this fiscal year ending June
30, 1991.</p>
<p>The Victoria state government, also run by the Labor
Party, was under pressure from its members to sell State Bank
only to government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, rather than
to an investor-controlled institution. The state government
rejected a slightly higher offer for State Bank from Westpac
Banking Corp., contending that the Commonwealth Bank offer
was better because it includes certain federal tax benefits
for the state.</p>
<p>Don Sanders, managing director of Commonwealth Bank, said
the merger "will create the strongest financial-services
group in Australia."</p>
<p>The move wouldn't be possible without the federal
government's giving the bank the ability to issue equity
capital, Mr. Sanders said in a statement.</p>
<p>The federal government will maintain its guarantee of
Commonwealth Bank's liabilities, including deposits. The
acquisition is subject to due-diligence checks by
Commonwealth Bank, as well as government and central bank
approvals and certain legislation.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank's most-recent published accounts for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1989 show total assets at A$60.66
billion and group capital and reserves totaling A$3.98
billion. Operating profit after tax rose 74% to A$475.9
million from A$273.4 million.</p>
<p>State Bank of Victoria dominates retail banking in that
state, Australia's second-biggest, so the acquisition greatly
strengthens Commonwealth Bank's competitive position in
Victoria. Indeed, State Bank is the fifth-biggest bank in the
country, with more than 500 branches and A$24 billion of
assets.</p>
