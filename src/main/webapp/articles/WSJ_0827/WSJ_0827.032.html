	<p class="article-leader">Some environmentalists are running headlong at the
property rights embedded in the U.S. Constitution. The
question is why the Bush Administration has been helping the
greens succeed.
   In a normal world, a clean environment and private
property are perfectly compatible. As residents of Leningrad
or Leipzig know, private owners do far better by preservation
than socialists have done. But in their zeal to cleanse the
world of man's sins, U.S. enviros have been ignoring the
Constitution's Fifth Amendment ban against the "taking" of
private property without compensation. Idaho Republican Steve
Symms tried to remind them late last month by offering a
modest amendment to the Senate farm bill. He ran into the
buzzsaw of the green lobby and its friends at the
Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Symms amendment is hardly radical. All it would do is
require the Justice Department to review the guidelines
federal agencies use to vet regulations so they aren't an
unconstitutional "taking." In effect, the amendment would
enforce a 1988 executive order (reissued by George Bush)
implementing two Supreme Court judgments on "takings." The
White House agreed not to oppose the amendment, but EPA
fought it behind the scenes on Capitol Hill lest anyone else
get a chance to question its judgment.</p>
<p>Rhode Island Republican John Chafee told fellow Senators
the green lobby considered this an "environmental" vote. The
National Wildlife Federation issued a hysterical letter
claiming it would result in "superfluous takings lawsuits,"
as if lawsuits haven't been the warp and woof of modern
environmentalism. The amendment lost 52-43, with protean
conservatives Gordon Humphrey (R., N.H.) and Alabama
Democrats Richard Shelby and Howell Heflin joining liberals
in voting against property rights.</p>
<p>This opposition is strange, because support for Symms
crosses normal ideological lines. Free-market farm groups
support the idea, but so does the usually pro-regulation
American Agriculture Movement. They've united in opposition
to the way federal agencies -- the EPA and Army Corps of
Engineers -- have imperially blocked development on most
private wetlands throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>In a letter to Senators, AAM's national director, David
Senter, wrote that U.S. farmers stand to lose "25% to 50% of
their net equity due to the outright taking of their land by
the federal government." Federal agencies, he added, "are
using wetlands delineation, clean water, and other laws as a
way to take control of vast areas of farmland, much of which
has been farmed for decades and has nothing to do with
permanent wetlands."</p>
<p>This doesn't impress top EPA officials, who've long talked
as if the Founders' notions about property are quaint
anachronisms. Reviewing a book in 1988, EPA general counsel
Donald Elliott endorsed "an evolutionary theory of property."
He added that, "Such a theory will not conclude, however,
that the only system of property possible in a Darwinian
world is 19th-century capitalism's."</p>
<p>EPA Director William Reilly has attacked what he called,
as recently as 1985, "mainstream attitudes about private
property and freedom of action." He criticized these
attitudes for producing "tawdry gateways to some of our
greatest national parks." Apparently, Mr. Reilly's aesthetic
sensibilities are offended by the Motel Sixes and Citgo
stations that serve the hoi polloi outside the parks. He's
also written that "conscious public choice" -- i.e., his own
regulatory choice -- is needed, or else, gasp, "the market
will decide which land gets developed and which remains as it
is."</p>
<p>As it happens, U.S. courts are moving against Mr. Reilly's
views -- and toward more protection for property rights.
Shortly before the Senate voted on Symms, the U.S. Claims
Court ordered the U.S. to pay substantial fines for unfairly
"taking" private wetlands. It ordered $1,029,000 in
compensation for the Army Corps' refusal to allow limestone
mining on 98 acres in Dade County, Fla. It also awarded $2.66
million for a taking of 12.5 acres in Long Beach Township,
N.J., once again after the Army Corps denied any development.
So taxpayers will now have to pay for regulatory mistakes
that the Symms amendment is designed to prevent.</p>
<p>As Soviet reformers know, private property rights lead to
a cleaner environment because they imply individual
responsibility. Maybe what Bill Reilly and his EPA colleagues
need is a couple of years studying Lake Baikal to remind
them.</p>
