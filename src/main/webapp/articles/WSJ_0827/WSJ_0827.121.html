	<p class="article-leader">Summer is normally the best time for ice cream sales, but
for Steve's Homemade Ice Cream Inc. this year it has been
dripping with problems.
   The Lindenhurst, N.Y., company reported a loss of $86,000,
or a penny a share, for the second quarter, compared with net
income of $531,000, or four cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue fell 24% to $6.8 million from $8.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ice cream maker attributed the loss to problems with
the inventory control program of a major buyer, a temporary
disruption of the company's distribution system in California
and Florida, and a dispute with a major New England area
developer licensee. Officials declined to identify the
customers involved.</p>
<p>Company officials say they are confident that earnings
will turn in the third quarter. The company continues to
spend heavily on advertising, investing $1.2 million more on
promotion in the first six months of this year than it did in
the 1989 period. Officials also say they expect to resolve
the dispute with the developer and licensee soon.</p>
