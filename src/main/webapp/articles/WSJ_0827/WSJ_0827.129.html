	<p class="article-leader">I was traumatized by exchange rates long ago. It was in
1936, to be exact, when I had a course in international
finance with the redoubtable Prof. Jacob Viner. I could never
understand why the exchange rate on the British pound was
$4.88 whereas the rate on the French franc was 20 to the
dollar. If the pound was $4.88 why wasn't the franc $.05? Or
if the franc was 20 to the dollar why wasn't the pound .205
to the dollar? I just didn't know which country was up. So I
gave up thinking about the subject for a long, long, time.
   When I can't avoid the subject it still baffles me. For
example, I do some work on the Israeli economy. Now, when
Americans say that the exchange rate went up they mean that
the dollar rose relative to other currencies. But when the
Israelis say that the exchange rate went up they mean that
other currencies rose relative to the shekel. Baffling] Maybe
it's because they read from right to left.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>My allergy to exchange rates really hurts when I have to
meet a foreign currency hand to hand, as was seen on a recent
trip to Israel and France.</p>
<p>Leaving Israel to fly to Paris I had a handful of leftover
shekels. I decided to exchange them for francs. Going from
the exotic shekel to the romantic franc without passing
through the humdrum dollar made me feel like a sophisticated
jet-setter.</p>
<p>I received 279 francs, which somehow seemed enough for
taxi fare from Charles de Gaulle Airport to my Paris hotel. I
also got a printout saying that the rate was .39. Since I
thought that the shekel was worth about 50 cents and the
franc about 20, it seemed reasonable enough that a figure
like .39 should appear somewhere, although I wouldn't have
bet on doing the algebra right the first time.</p>
<p>Five hours later I am speeding along in a French taxi and
the taximeter is clicking off two francses at an even more
furious pace, alongside a sign saying "No checks accepted." I
worry about whether my 279 francs are going to survive this
race, at the same time trying to remember whether I should
multiply the francs by .2 or by five to get them into my
native currency.</p>
<p>To my relief, the taxi and the meter slow down as we enter
the XVI Arrondissement, and the meter says only 132 when we
stop in front of the hotel. "One hundred and sixty," says the
driver. (All this is a blur in my mind now, and I'm not sure
what language we were using. I suppose English.) "Why?" I
ask. "Luggage," he explains. I am so annoyed and angry about
this, as well as by his general manner, that I determine to
give him no tip. I had barely reached the sidewalk, however,
when I realized that I had only 19 francs left. I had given
the driver 260. But he assured me that I was mistaken. He
showed me that in one pocket he had a lot of money, which was
his, and in the other pocket he had a little, which was what
had been mine. Before we could pursue the subject he drove
off.</p>
<p>The receptionist in the hotel was philosophical. She
explained that the event was not uncommon and there was
nothing I could do about it.</p>
<p>So there my wife and I were on a Sunday afternoon,
Ascension Day, in a small hotel, sans restaurant, in a quiet
part of Paris, having had no dinner and with about $2 in
francs, after tipping the bellman. I asked the receptionist,
who for some reason reminded me of "A Tale of Two Cities,"
whether she could cash a traveler's check. She could, and the
rate was 4.9. She saw my surprise and explained that the rate
had gone down (this was three days after the invasion of
Kuwait) but maybe it would go up next week. She was still
philosophical. "It's only a few centimes," she said. Later in
a calmer mood I figured out that 4.9 is 2% less than five.</p>
<p>All the money amounts are trivial. This story is not about
the amounts; it is about confusion, mental anguish,
humiliation. It is about states of mind, which is, after all,
what economics is all about.</p>
<p>Armed with $50 worth of francs we set out to find a light
supper. Fortunately, French restaurants, brasseries and
bistros all have menus posted outside, so you can review your
options before committing yourself. Even with $50 my options
were not great. But the second time around the place I
realized that the solution to my problem was the brasserie
whose menu welcomed credit cards. There I would not have to
worry about running out of francs and someone else would have
to figure out how much my bill was in dollars. (When I did
get my credit card bill at home my franc expenditures had
been translated into dollars at a rate more favorable to me
than any I encountered in Paris.)</p>
<p>The next morning we went to the bank to change money.
There was the usual bulletin board with exchange rates in two
columns -- Vente and Achat. Which was I, buying or selling? I
was selling dollars and buying francs. The bank was selling
francs and buying dollars. I knew that whichever it was, I
was going to get the smaller amount. And even the smaller
amount was 5.2 with some more decimals, much more than La
Tricoteuse at the hotel had paid. In fact, the rate was
5.27719 francs to the dollar. I cashed only $50 because I
still had the money I had exchanged at the hotel. Also,
hadn't I learned that when the oil price rose the dollar did
too, because people had to pay for oil in dollars? Probably I
would get a better rate the next day.</p>
<p>The net I received was 234.21. The commission and
value-added tax had eaten up 29.61 francs. Later I figured
out the net rate had been 4.6842, almost 5% less than I had
gotten from La Tricoteuse, whom I had unjustly maligned.</p>
<p>We now had almost 500 francs and started out to spend
them. Our first stop was a fruit stand. Have you ever tried
to calculate in your head what is the price in cents of two
oranges when they cost 35.75 francs per kilo and you do not
have access to scales? Or how much money you should give the
cashier when you are not immediately sure whether quinze is
15 or 50? You hold out a handful of change and let her pick
what she wants. She seems honest.</p>
<p>Having managed to get rid of quite a few francs, we
undertook to get more the next morning. I proposed to La
Tricoteuse that she should sell me some, but she declined. I
think she had an agreement with the bank next door not to do
any banking during hours when the bank was open. At the bank
I discovered that, contrary to my speculation about the price
of oil, the dollar had declined from 5.27719 francs to
5.22027. But we had learned about the commission, which was a
constant, so by buying $200 worth we reduced (raised?) the
net price to 5.072.</p>
<p>Now we were really flush with francs, and I had a sudden
insight into the truth of monetarism. The idea is that
individual behavior is significantly governed by the
possession of a certain kind of asset, called "money." Here I
was with dollar currency, traveler's checks, credit cards,
and checks on an account in an internationally known bank.
With a call to my broker I could get a telegraphic transfer
of a large amount of money from a money market fund. Compared
to my total liquid assets, the amounts of French currency I
ever held were minute. But the difference between feeling
that I had little French currency and feeling that I had much
was significant. When I felt that I had little I tried to
hold on to it, fearing to find myself in a place or time when
it would be indispensable to me. When I felt that I had much
I was quite prepared to get rid of it, lest I have it "left
over" at some point, or have to trade it in at a great loss.
I had demonstrated that money matters. How much it matters I
leave to econometricians.</p>
<p>Feeling flush with francs we presented ourselves on the
day before we were to leave Paris at a very expensive
restaurant for lunch. As soon as I looked at the menu my
franc anxiety returned. I had never seen such prices. I began
a hasty and not reassuring estimate of how many francs were
in my wallet and my wife's pocketbook. There was nothing on
the menu to indicate that credit cards were accepted. I
couldn't see any money passing at other tables or even anyone
signing checks. Presumably the waiter knew without being told
whose lunch was to be charged to the duc de Guermantes. But
he would know that I wasn't the duc of anything. For one
thing, I had had to borrow a coat and tie from the checkroom
to get admitted in the first place. I wondered how many hours
of dishwashing it would take to work off 500 francs. When the
check came I inquired, appearing as confident as I could,
whether they took credit cards. The answer was affirmative,
and I was rich again.</p>
<p>That left us with an unexpectedly large amount of francs.
Even after some splurging I had some to turn in at the bank
at the airport, where I sold at 5.77 to the dollar francs
that I had bought at an average price of 4.9787. I was glad
to get rid of them. Now I could stop thinking about centimes
and resume thinking about trillions of dollars in the budget
or the GNP.</p>
