	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Salomon Brothers Inc.'s new Phibro Oil Trust
units were the most active issue on the American Stock
Exchange in their first day of trading Friday.
   Salomon said it priced 16 million units, four million more
than proposed, at $4.65 a unit. Almost 2.7 million units
traded, and the issue closed slightly higher at $4.75.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Phibro units, which allows investors to bet on the
price of crude oil five years from now, were brought to
market by Salomon and Bear, Stearns & Co. after an earlier
proposed version was pulled in May when oil markets plunged.</p>
