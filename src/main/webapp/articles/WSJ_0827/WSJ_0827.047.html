	<p class="article-leader">MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian Airlines, a
government-owned domestic carrier, posted an operating loss
of 13.7 million Australian dollars (US$11.4 million) for the
fiscal year ended June 30, compared with year-earlier profit
of A$70.4 million, citing a 1989 pilots strike that disrupted
the industry for eight months. The loss totaled A$79.9
million before an income-tax credit and gains from selling
aircraft.
   Operating revenue fell 18% to A$1.02 billion from A$1.24
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chairman Ted Harris said he believes Australian Airlines
will return to profitability in the current fiscal year. He
said the airline is "well prepared" for partial deregulation
of Australia's airline industry that is to start in November.</p>
