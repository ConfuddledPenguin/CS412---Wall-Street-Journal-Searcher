	<p class="article-leader">SOUTHERN Co. (Atlanta) -- Moody's Investors Serv- ice Inc.
said it cut its ratings on $490 million of securities of this
electric holding company's Gulf Power Co. unit, Pensacola,
Fla. The rating concern cited a "weakening of Gulf Power's
financial performance, and further pressure on prospective
credit quality measurements, given an unconstructive rate
decision recently issued by the Florida Public Service
Commission." Earlier this month, the commission granted Gulf
Power a rate increase of only $11.8 million; the company had
requested a $26.3 million boost. Moody's lowered ratings on
Gulf Power's first mortgage and secured pollution control
bonds to single-A-2 from single-A-1; unsecured
pollution-control bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2; and
preferred stock to single-A-2 from single-A-1. A Gulf Power
spokesman said the downgrades are "further evidence that the
Florida Public Service Commission decision was
counterproductive."</p>
