	<p class="article-leader">BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. said it asked a federal
court in Iowa to block the Iowa attorney general from acting
against the company's health claims in advertisements for
Special K, 40 + Bran Flakes and Frosted Flakes cereals.
   Kellogg said it filed its suit to end what it views as
"harassment" by Iowa Attorney General Thomas J. Miller and
the attorneys general of seven other states. The officials
raised questions two years ago about the Kellogg ads. Since
then, Kellogg said it has engaged in "long and fruitless
discussions" with the attorneys general and provided
thousands of pages of documents substantiating its claims.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We think it's time to bring this to an end and let the
courts decide," said Joseph M. Stewart, senior vice president
for corporate affairs. "We stand behind our advertising. . .
. They (the attorneys general) continue to say our
advertising is misleading."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller, the Iowa attorney general, couldn't be reached
for comment. Kellogg said the attorneys general hadn't
produced a single consumer complaint or scientific study to
support their allegations.</p>
<p>Kellogg said the issue involves its claims that Special K
is a high-protein cereal and can help dieters or exercisers
"keep the muscle, lose the fat;" that 40 + Bran Flakes is
rich in fiber and iron and is beneficial to those 40 and
older and that Frosted Flakes is "good for you" and has less
sugar than many snack foods.</p>
