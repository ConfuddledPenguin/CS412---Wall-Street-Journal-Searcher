	<p class="article-leader">LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R. -- In the city where Vladimir Ilyich
Lenin hatched plans for the Communist Revolution, today's
leaders are dreaming their own revolutionary dreams.
   "We'll put out our own currency and it will be
convertible," newly elected city council member Alexander
Trubachev says excitedly. "We want every Leningrader to have
an international credit card, backed by the Leningrad ruble.
This will immediately integrate us with world economies."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The idea of a city setting up its own currency and using
it for independent deals with foreign countries may sound
treasonous, but Mr. Trubachev is just one of a group that
thinks Leningrad will succeed best by going it alone.
Leningraders have long been proud of their city's history as
the gateway to the West. Now they are feeling stifled by
Moscow's dictates.</p>
<p>Many of the Soviet Union's 15 republics feel the same way
and the initiative for economic reform is shifting from the
central government to regional areas. From the huge Russian
Federation to tiny autonomous regions, districts are saying
they can move faster alone.</p>
<p>Leningrad's leaders hope to take advantage of the fact
that their city was one of five areas declared by the Russian
parliament as "joint enterprise zones." But as with many such
declarations, nobody knows exactly what this means, or how a
free economic zone operates.</p>
<p>The cacophony of ideas takes form in the grand marble
building that houses the Leningrad Parliament. In a tiny,
jammed office, politicians hold a running discussion while
phones jangle and visitors pop in with their own proposals.</p>
<p>One commission is holding a contest for the best idea on
how to transfer to a market economy. People send in their
ideas, but they probably won't see light because the contest
runs beyond the deadline for Leningrad's proposal to be
submitted to the Russian government.</p>
<p>Many of the goals may prove to be grandiose since no one
has convincingly described how to achieve them: International
economic ties should be liberalized so that foreign companies
receive tax breaks and no longer have to register with the
Finance Ministry; a separate banking system should be
established; and huge industrial monopolies should be broken
up into thousands of smaller companies.</p>
<p>"This disintegration seems to be easily achievable," Pyotr
Filipov says almost blithely.</p>
<p>A representative on the Leningrad City Council and the
Russian Federation parliament, Mr. Filipov describes another
project already under way: persuading foreign investors to
buy some of Leningrad's graceful but decrepit buildings,
refurbish them and then lease them for 25 to 50 years.</p>
<p>Mayor Anatoli Sobchak is visiting the U.S. with an even
more straightforward appeal. One of his missions is to
collect donations that will serve as the core of a fund to
reconstruct his city. Nevsky Prospect, the center of fashion
and elegance in Czarist Russia, could become the center of
tourism and hard currency, he figures. Once a grand avenue of
delicately ornamented architecture, today it is full of
potholes and the buildings are shabby.</p>
<p>Some foreign and Soviet businessmen have started pushing
Leningrad toward its goal. Hard currency, increasingly the
favored means of transaction in Moscow, is even better
established in Leningrad. Some Leningrad economists are even
toying with the idea of making the dollar the city's new
currency.</p>
<p>Taxis accepting only dollars line the airport curb.
Hamburger stands sell Cokes for hard currency but only Soviet
soda for rubles. Refreshment stands sell vanilla ice cream
for 30 kopeks on the street while a nearby German-Soviet
joint venture sells pricey Italian parfaits for hard
currency.</p>
<p>Leningrad may be the first to open a Soviet stock
exchange. New York Stock Exchange officials visited recently
to discuss the idea with Mr. Sobchak's team. "They'll
probably be the first," says a Western diplomat. "Leningrad
just has a more maverick personality than Moscow."</p>
<p>A group of computer experts and economists are leading the
thrust. Sergei Petrov heads a team whose current pet project
is creating an automated stock exchange. Mr. Petrov has ties
to the Midwest Stock Exchange, which may offer advice on how
to establish an automated exchange.</p>
<p>"At first we wondered whether there would be an exchange
at all," says Mr. Petrov. "Then we applied the main rule of
marketing: Create your own market."</p>
<p>This kind of vigor and enthusiasm also expresses itself in
a public confidence in the government that has long since
vanished in Moscow and other parts of the country.
Leningraders are unusually forgiving of their local
government. They often excuse the fact that few concrete
improvements have been made, saying that the council was only
elected a few months ago and it needs time to work.</p>
<p>Leningrad's first free elections in March led to a city
council in which two-thirds of the deputies are new, and most
ally themselves with democratic movements. Even before Boris
Yeltsin, the popular leader of the enormous Russian
Federation, announced he was going to quit the Communist
Party, a poll in Leningrad showed that 49% of the city's
Communists had already left the party or were planning to as
soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Kesselman argues that even more important than the
enlightened leadership of Mr. Sobchak and his city council is
the change in the way Leningraders are thinking about life.
"Now the old structures don't work and new ones are just
being formed," he says. "In such a situation, the changes
which are going to take place are very dependent on the
readiness of the population for change."</p>
<p>And for all the politicians' bright ideas, few have begun
to tackle exactly how they should be achieved. Take the
break-up of monopolies: cities, regions and the central
government have yet to agree on who actually owns a given
factory, a hot argument that must be resolved before the
first steps to privatization can take place.</p>
<p>"Of course we have contradictions with the central
government," says Mr. Filipov. "We live in a very unbalanced
time in which republics don't ask for rights, they simply
take them themselves."</p>
<p>But such contradictions don't worry him. "Suppose we make
the decision to introduce free prices in our zone. Would
anyone be able to stop us? I don't think so."</p>
