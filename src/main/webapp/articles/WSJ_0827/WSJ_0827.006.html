	<p class="article-leader">If you're shopping for a home mortgage, don't despair.
Things aren't as bleak as they seem.
   True, rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages
have moved up in recent weeks and may go even higher. But
mortgage rates in general are still lower than they were last
spring and adjustable-rate loans can be, and will probably
remain, a good deal for many borrowers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's because fixed-rate mortgages tend to be pegged to
long-term interest rates, while adjustable-rate mortgages, or
ARMs, typically are pegged to short-term rates. The crisis in
the Persian Gulf and fears of rising oil prices and inflation
are pushing up long-term rates; at the same time, a softening
economy and fears of a recession are keeping short-term rates
low.</p>
<p>"The gap {between fixed and adjustable rates} is starting
to widen again," says Harry V. Tomlinson, senior vice
president for the Northeast region of Sears Mortgage Co. "We
haven't seen a dramatic shift to ARMs yet . . . but we're
gearing up for it." Including a recent acquisition, the
Sears, Roebuck & Co. unit has about $13 billion in mortgages
outstanding nationwide.</p>
<p>Adjustable rates have actually declined a fraction of a
percentage point in the last month and are off more than a
third of a percentage point since last spring, according to
HSH Associates, a mortgage-information service based in
Butler, N.J. The average first-year rate on a one-year ARM is
currently 8.20%, according to HSH's survey of 2,000 lenders
nationwide.</p>
<p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is
10.30%, according to HSH. That's up more than a third of a
percentage point from early August. But just a little more
than three months ago, in early May, lenders were charging an
average 10.71%; in the spring of 1989, rates went as high as
11.33%.</p>
<p>At today's levels, the "spread" between fixed and
adjustable rates is about two percentage points, enough to
make a meaningful difference in monthly payments. On a
$100,000 mortgage, for instance, the difference between 8.20%
and 10.30% means a savings of roughly $150 a month for those
who opt for the ARM.</p>
<p>A study by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, a
Chicago-based trade group, indicates that adjustable-rate
mortgages have been considerably cheaper than fixed-rate
loans over much of the past decade. The study, which covers
the period since April 1981, found that an ARM would have cut
a home buyer's interest payments by an average of 25%.</p>
<p>Even borrowers who opted for adjustable rates in 1987 and
1988, only to see their payments increase as interest rates
rose steadily through the spring of 1989, would have saved at
least $1,500 in interest on a $100,000 mortgage. The holder
of an adjustable-rate mortgage originated in November 1981
could have saved more than $60,000 in interest, the study
indicates. The study doesn't take into account the homeowners
who refinanced their fixed-rate mortgages when rates dropped.</p>
<p>But there's more involved than monthly payments in
choosing between adjustable and fixed rates. Borrowers have
to "consider the level of risk they're willing to assume,
financially and emotionally," says Mr. Tomlinson of Sears.</p>
<p>The interest rate on an ARM generally is adjusted every
six months, annually or once every three years, depending on
the index it is tied to. Lenders in the East and Midwest tend
to favor an index based on Treasury securities, often the
six-month or one-year Treasury bill, while a monthly
cost-of-funds index issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of
San Francisco is more common in western states.</p>
<p>Typically, the rate on an ARM can rise or fall two
percentage points a year and five or six percentage points
over the life of the loan. While three-year adjustables often
are considered more desirable because they are more
predictable, lenders say they expect ARMs with shorter
adjustment periods to become more popular because they are
tied to lower, shorter-term interest rates.</p>
<p>Financial advisers say that before agreeing to an
adjustable rate, borrowers should know the index used, the
margin charged over the index, the frequency of adjustments,
the periodic and lifetime caps, and whether there's the
possibility of "negative amortization." That's when payment
increases are limited so a rise in rates may mean that the
monthly payment isn't sufficient to cover both principal and
interest actually being charged. The difference is added to
the balance of the loan, and the borrower can end up owing
more than the original mortgage.</p>
<p>All that uncertainty leads many people to prefer
fixed-rate mortgages. Only about a quarter to a third of
mortgages currently being written are ARMs. They were more
than half during most of the period from late 1987 through
mid-1989. Lenders say ARMs' market share starts to increase
significantly when fixed rates get to the 11% to 12% range.</p>
<p>They say the outlook for rates in the next few months
depends to a large extent on events in the Persian Gulf. If
hostilities escalate, long-term rates could soar. If there's
a peaceful settlement, rates could resume their slow decline
that began last spring. "For now, it's a real tough call"
between adjustable and fixed-rate mortgages, says Dennis
Jacobe, research director for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.</p>
<p>Rather than lose sleep, it may help to remember the high
double-digit rates of the early 1980s. Current rates are "not
unattractive from a longer-term perspective," says Richard
Peach, deputy chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers
Association. "Compared with a year ago, certainly the last 10
years, they look fairly good."</p>
