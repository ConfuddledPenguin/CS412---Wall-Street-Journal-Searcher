	<p class="article-leader">"For venture capitalists, it'll never again be business as
usual. The industry is paying the price of success."
   So says William Sahlman, a professor of entrepreneurial
finance at the Harvard Business School.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After successfully financing some of America's best-known
high-growth companies, including Federal Express Corp., Apple
Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp., the venture-capital
industry began to hit rough times. The industry's average
annual return on investment, which ran as high as 30% a
decade ago, has been falling sharply for the past five years.
Many venture funds have had trouble raising capital.</p>
<p>Venture-capital partnerships, which provide financing for
young companies, attracted a wave of new capital after their
phenomenal success in the 1970s and early 1980s. But the
increase in capital bid up the prices venture capitalists
paid for investments and cut returns, Mr. Sahlman says. "Too
many companies were being funded in the same industries, and
the inevitable result was competitive mayhem."</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Mr. Sahlman has been studying
entrepreneurship and venture capital for over a decade. His
Harvard Business School course on entrepreneurial finance
attracts over 50% of the school's second-year class. He is
also a director of two Boston companies, Avid Technology
Inc., a provider of video editing software, and Butcher Co.,
a 110-year old manufacturer of industrial sanitary supply
goods.</p>
<p>"The rates of return for the foreseeable future will not
reach the levels" of the late '70s and early '80s, he
predicts. But the problems of the past five years seem to be
clearing the way for new opportunities and new strategies. In
an interview, Mr. Sahlman considered the future of venture
capital and entrepreneurship in America:</p>
<p>Q. Is venture capital dead?</p>
<p>A. Not by a long shot. The prospects for the industry in
the 1990s are better than they have been for over a decade.</p>
<p>Less capital and fewer funds means fewer companies will be
financed. The companies that do receive money will get more
attention from their investors and have a better chance of
survival. The rates of return will increase from the low
levels experienced in the past five or six years.</p>
<p>Q. Will we see a change in the way venture capitalists
invest?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Venture capitalists are going to look for fewer
home runs -- companies that potentially can achieve sales of
$500 million or so. They are going to invest in smaller
companies that can dominate a niche, companies that often may
be no bigger than $50 million to $100 million in sales, but
highly profitable.</p>
<p>Q. What else will have to change?</p>
<p>A. Venture capitalists will have to open up their
investment horizons. That means going beyond traditional
high-tech ideas such as workstations and semiconductors. It
might make more sense to look at service businesses that
could improve with the application of technology. More
important, they will have to cast the entrepreneurial net
wider to include women, as well as minorities.</p>
<p>Q. What role will venture capitalists have to play in this
new environment?</p>
<p>A. They have to provide more than just money. They will
need to develop closer ties with the companies they invest
in, provide more help with recruiting and strategic
partnering. They also will have to help their companies with
competitive positioning in a new and ever-changing global
marketplace.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists have to recognize that they aren't the
only sources of capital for fast-growing companies. They face
competition from other venture capitalists, from angels, from
corporate investors and from institutions investing directly
in start-up businesses.</p>
<p>Q. What are the implications for entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>A. There are plenty of sources of risk capital for
entrepreneurs today. They need to choose their sources of
capital carefully for the best chances of success.</p>
<p>Searching for the cheapest capital may not be in the best
long-term interest of a growing company. From whom you raise
money often is more important than the terms on which you
obtain that money.</p>
<p>Going public may seem like a good way to get cheap money,
but it also can cause long-term business strategies to be
jettisoned. Many managers hurt their companies in order to
try to live up to the unrealistic expectations embedded in
high public market stock prices.</p>
<p>Q. What are the alternatives to venture capital?</p>
<p>A. Angels, for one. The entrepreneurial revolution created
many successes, such as H. Ross Perot, who themselves are
investing in new ventures. Institutional investors -- Harvard
University's endowment, for example -- that only invested
through venture-capital partnerships are investing directly.</p>
<p>And then there are the corporations, both domestic and
international, that are moving up the food chain, investing
earlier in the development of new companies. For many small
companies, finding a corporate partner that can help in their
overall growth may be more helpful than trying to cash out
quickly by going public.</p>
<p>Q. Should government try to provide capital for
entrepreneurial businesses?</p>
<p>A. No. Government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship
would be more effective if focused on helping companies sell
products and services than if focused on access to financing.
Loan guarantees often result in poor investment decisions and
shift risk to taxpayers without sufficient macroeconomic
benefits. Such efforts might make more sense if there was a
genuine shortage of risk capital, but I don't believe a
shortage exists.</p>
<p>Q. Should the government play any role in helping the
entrepreneurial climate?</p>
<p>A. Government should stop changing policies that have an
impact on risk-taking and entrepreneurship. It also can
simplify and reduce the cost of raising capital by getting
rid of such regulations as state blue sky laws {regulations
governing securities offerings} which make it harder and more
costly to raise money without offsetting benefits. In
Massachusetts, for example, it can cost as much as $20,000 to
register securities for sale under the blue sky laws.</p>
<p>Q. What are prospects for the future?</p>
<p>A. The entrepreneurial revolution hasn't run out of steam.
It's alive and well and venture capitalists will continue to
play a role in financing high-potential ventures. Both
investors and entrepreneurs will likely achieve better
financial results in the next five years than they have in
the past five.</p>
