	<p class="article-leader">General Electric Co.'s aerospace division announced
additional layoffs, citing cutbacks in the U.S. military
budget.
   GE Aerospace of Valley Forge, Pa., said that as part of a
restructuring of its Automated Systems department, it will
eliminate 650 out of the 950 jobs at its Burlington, Mass.,
plant by 1992. The plant makes automatic test equipment for
military programs. Some of the operations at the plant will
be transferred to other GE Aerospace facilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GE Aerospace will also close its Huntsville, Ala., plant
by the end of 1991 and move the operations to facilities in
Daytona Beach, Fla. The Huntsville plant employs 400 people.
A GE spokesman said that half of them will be offered
relocation, and the rest of the jobs will be eliminated
through early retirement and attrition.</p>
<p>The latest cutbacks follow the division's announcement a
week earlier that it would eliminate 100 jobs as part of
consolidating its Re-Entry Systems department into one
facility. Last April, the division eliminated 4,200 jobs.</p>
