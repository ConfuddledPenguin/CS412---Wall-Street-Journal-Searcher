	<p class="article-leader">CORDOVA, Alaska -- The workday is a half-hour old and Todd
Danson is already up to his elbows in slime.
   He grabs slippery salmon. He slices off bad salmon parts.
He scrapes away unsightly salmon detritus. There is water,
water everywhere; he breathes air soggy with salmon aromas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By night, the 19-year-old Mr. Danson has handled so many
salmon that he is slathered in slime from his boots to the
top of his rain slicker. Off duty, after 12 hours on a
swift-moving processing line of nothing but salmon, salmon,
salmon, he closes his eyes to sleep and often sees the
silvery fish swimming on the darkened ceiling above.</p>
<p>Mr. Danson is a "slimer" at North Pacific Processors Inc.,
a salmon cannery here on the shores of scenic Prince William
Sound. It is a job with a name succinctly describing its
nature, and one little changed over the 112 years that
Alaska's huge schools of salmon have made the journey from
sea to can. By Sept. 1, the traditional end of the
eight-weeklong salmon season, Alaska's commercial fishermen
will have harvested about 580 million pounds of salmon, with
a wholesale value of more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Virtually all of that fish passes through the gloved hands
of slimers, the bottom feeders on the employment chain of the
state's 22,000 seasonal cannery workers. Slimers clean up
fish as they leave a machine that removes heads and slices
out entrails; by paring off fins, leftover membranes, bruised
flesh and any mystery parts, slimers ensure that no salmon is
too slimy, or unsightly, to earn a place in a can bound for
the supermarket shelf.</p>
<p>"This entire industry depends on them," says Ken Roemhildt
superintendent at North Pacific.</p>
<p>"You have to be a psycho, a subhumanoid or a college
student out for money and adventure to do this," says Mark
Muro, a New York native who spent eight years in cannery
work, a lot of it on slime lines, before recently moving to
Anchorage to work in film production. Mr. Muro pauses and
gets a far-away look in his eyes: "It's like the gulag," he
says.</p>
<p>"It's wet, it's cold, it's gross," agrees Sherri Brooks, a
22-year-old Idaho math major who has journeyed to Cordova for
the past three summers to work in North Pacific's cannery, at
least part of the time on the slime line. Ms. Brooks these
days is the envy of anyone who has ever picked up a sliming
knife, having climbed the cannery ladder out of the slime and
into a dry job slinging hash in North Pacific's mess hall,
where slimers come to feed.</p>
<p>"No," Ms. Brooks says, anticipating the obvious question,
"We hardly ever serve them salmon."</p>
<p>Like salmon returning to spawn, slimers and other cannery
workers are drawn by a stream of money. Wages start at about
$7 a hour, and the grueling 15-hour workdays often allow
workers to rack up hundreds of hours of overtime during the
short summer season. A journeyman slimer during a peak salmon
harvest can net over $10,000. For 23-year-old Bruce Waller of
Idaho, in his fourth season at North Pacific, this year's
cannery wages will essentially mean a financially worry-free
year at graduate school, he says.</p>
<p>College students constitute about half the work force at
most Alaska canneries. The remaining jobs are filled by a
smattering of hardy locals, and by contract laborers, notably
from the Philippines and Mexico, who are often able to parlay
a summer's earnings into a life of leisure back home.</p>
<p>Dalia Calbrio and Carlos Gonzales are a Mexico City couple
who have worked at North Pacific for three summers. Their
wages allow Mr. Gonzales to take the rest of the year off to
climb mountains; Ms. Calbrio, a geologist by training,
teaches part time and runs in marathons.</p>
<p>Most canneries provide room and board, charging workers
about $15 a day for a Spartan bunk and three hot meals a day
-- a bargain in a state where motels in bush towns can cost
$100 a night and a breakfast of bacon and eggs $10. But it's
traditional, especially among adventuresome college students,
to save room and board charges by camping out.</p>
<p>So each summer, in virtually every Alaskan canning town,
entire "slimer colonies" crop up. Here in Cordova the area of
choice is Hippie Cove, a clearing, sliced by a stream,
between spruce forest and the icy waters of Orca Inlet.
Typical of slimer colonies, it is a mish-mash of tents,
leantos and other makeshift quarters.</p>
<p>Jessica Mathon and a friend commandeered a junked van and
had it towed to the cove, where they have lived since June.
Ms. Mathon, a Santa Cruz, Calif., college student, says the
cove has been a generally neighborly place -- there are
communal salmon bakes, and a cooperatively maintained sauna
-- but is not without its drawbacks.</p>
<p>"Not too long ago, there was a guy who pulled out a gun
and started shooting the place up," Ms. Mathon says. "A few
bullets whizzed by our van. It was crazy." The incident
persuaded her to come in from the cove and seek safer lodging
in Cordova, she says.</p>
<p>Cordova is notoriously rainy, and the cove is subject to
periodic flooding. One year, while workers were on duty, a
flash flood washed an entire slimer tent colony into the
nearby inlet. Aware of that, Ric Cook, a Bremerton, Wash.,
college student who works the North Pacific slime line, chose
higher ground, moving into a plywood crate, rainproofed with
a bright blue tarp, in an equipment yard adjacent to a North
Pacific bunkhouse. About 20 other slimers share the location,
some of them jammed like sardines into a cavernous surplus
stainless steel fish bin.</p>
<p>Mr. Cook's life is made somewhat easier by shower
privileges at the North Pacific bunkhouse; he dines on
care-packages mailed to him by his mother, a diet
considerably better than typical slimer-colony fare of Oreo
cookies and peanut butter sandwiches.</p>
<p>If there is adventure outside the cannery, there is almost
never any inside of it. Slimers and other workers say their
worst enemy is the tedium of long days on the fish
disassembly line. Some try to pass the time by counting the
countless stream of fish; others carve messages, including
vulgar ones, on fish and send them down the line to their
friends.</p>
<p>Occasionally, slimers resort to mischief. Fishhead fights,
a practice understandably frowned upon by cannery management,
are an inevitability of any canning season. Ex-slimer Mr.
Muro, who worked the rough-and-tumble fish processing plants
on Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, recalls even more
gross behavior. "There was always somebody there who thought
it was hysterically funny to put fish guts down your back,"
he says.</p>
<p>Sometimes nothing helps the monotony. Mr. Danson, after
being promoted from the slime line, says his new job
literally lulled him to sleep one day. He was demoted back to
sliming, an act so demoralizing that the University of
Nebraska student -- like 70% of all first-year cannery
workers -- will wash his hands of cannery work after his
rookie season.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Danson's promotion wasn't exactly to a
prized post, since sliming isn't the only slimy cannery job.
He was helping to supervise a gutting machine that sometimes
bathes workers in a pink fog of pulverized salmon. Then there
is cleanup, a job involving emptying "scum traps" and
crawling around under bloody, slimy machinery with a
high-pressure steam hose.</p>
<p>"That job lobotomizes some people. We had one kid --
really bright, articulate. After a week, he no longer spoke
in complete sentences," says Casey Crooks, a 26-year-old
quality-control foreman at the Chugach Alaska Corp. cannery
here.</p>
<p>For some, a little time on a fish processing line is
experience enough for a lifetime. After 12 days of cannery
life, Ms. Mathon found the work "disgusting" and quit to wait
on tables at a restaurant here. In lull periods between
delivering platters of eggs to hungry fishermen she says she
still hears the "clack, clack, clack" of cans moving along
the conveyor belt.</p>
<p>She recites the oath commonly heard on the slime line: "I
will never eat canned salmon."</p>
