	<p class="article-leader">"The Jesse and Pat Bill" (editorial, July 31) distorted
the real reasons why an overwhelming majority of the Senate
voted for the Textile, Apparel and Footwear Trade Act.
   We did so in order to preserve a vital manufacturing
industry and the jobs of more than 1.8 million of the world's
most productive workers. Sen. Pat Moynihan (D., N.Y.) and the
other 67 senators who voted for this bill realize that
textile, apparel and footwear workers, a majority of whom are
minorities and women, must compete against low wages and, in
the case of the People's Republic of China, slave labor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You accuse Sen. Jesse Helms, (R., N.C.) of being against
competition and self-reliance when it comes to preserving the
textile industry. In fact, Sen. Helms knows that no
manufacturing industry has risen to meet the competitive
challenge as aggressively as the textile, apparel and trade
industry. Over the course of the past decade, the industry
invested $18 billion in modernizing plants and equipment. The
MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity found that "between
1975 and 1985, textile mill productivity increased an average
of 5.6% a year, more than any other manufacturing industry."
Yet, despite this massive restructuring, the industry has
steadily lost market share, overwhelmed by a flood of imports
from low-wage countries.</p>
<p>Consumers do not benefit from lower-priced imports. Glance
through some mail-order catalogs and you'll see that
consumers pay exactly the same price for clothing, whether it
is U.S.-made or imported.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to weigh on the conscience of The Wall
Street Journal, however. We are moving from the Cold War into
a trade war; as geopolitics is replaced by geoeconomics, the
distinction between national security and economic security
becomes blurred. While our competitors pursue market share
and trample trade agreements, the Journal supports a trade
policy that can only be characterized as appeasement and
unilateral disarmament.</p>
<p>In passing the textile bill, the Senate showed that it was
not willing to stand idly by while industry by industry is
sacrificed on the altar of free trade. The only thing this
bill protects is the 60% U.S. market share of foreign
producers. It allows that market share to grow along with the
growth of the U.S. market.</p>
