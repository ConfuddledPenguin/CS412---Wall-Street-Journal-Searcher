	<p class="article-leader">Koninklijke Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfa briek Fokker N.V., a
Dutch aerospace concern, said its first-half profit more than
doubled to 41.9 million guilders ($24.1 million) -- exceeding
analysts' estimates -- from 14.1 million guilders a year
earlier.
   The latest results were boosted by a special gain of 10
million guilders related to disposal of 50% of Fokker's
Aircraft Financing & Trading B.V. unit. Total operating
income advanced 19% to 1.61 billion guilders from 1.35
billion guilders. But operating costs rose 19% to 1.556
billion guilders from 1.31 billion guilders. Operating profit
increased 6.5% to 50.9 million guilders from 47.8 million
guilders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 17% to 1.312 billion guilders from 1.12 billion
guilders.</p>
<p>Fokker, which had 1989 profit of 42.4 million guilders,
said that "if the U.S. dollar remains weak for an extended
period . . . this could depress profits in the years ahead."
Nevertheless, Ata Kahrel, director of Wesselius & Co., said,
"I think they will double their (1990) profit and resume
paying a dividend."</p>
