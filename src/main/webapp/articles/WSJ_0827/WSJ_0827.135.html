	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo's major stock-price index finished higher in a
volatile session Friday, posting its first gain in seven
trading days.
   London share prices also rose for the first time in seven
sessions. Most other European markets posted gains, Asian and
Pacific bourses were mixed, and South African gold stocks
skidded.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nikkei Index of 225 issues was up 428.13 points at
24165.76, helped by buying focused on blue-chip issues in the
late afternoon, traders said. The index plunged 1473.28
points Thursday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index added another 398.89
points to close the morning session at 24564.65.</p>
<p>In Friday's trading, volume on the first section was
estimated at 550 million shares, up from 477 million
Thursday. Declining issues still outnumbered gainers,
526-367, with 80 issues unchanged. But the Tokyo Stock Price
Index of all issues listed in the first section, which
plummeted 110.58 points Thursday, was up 16.47, or 0.90%, at
1845.72.</p>
<p>The Second Section Index, which fell 204.17 Thursday, was
down 79.41, or 2.19%, to close at 3554.74. Volume on the
second section was estimated at 10.3 million shares, up from
7.7 million Thursday.</p>
<p>After a weak opening, the Nikkei Index shot up nearly 750
points by midmorning. A Japanese news wire's headline at the
time said that Iraq was withdrawing from the Kuwait-Saudi
Arabian border. However, participants soon learned from
reports by other news services that Iraq wasn't withdrawing
but was replacing some elite troops at the border with less
highly trained units.</p>
<p>As investors sold again, the Nikkei fell back to an
intraday low of 23547. The afternoon rebound was prompted by
heavy buying by one of Japan's "Big Four" brokerage houses,
market sources said. That buying encouraged institutions and
investment trust funds to buy blue-chip shares in the
electric and construction sectors.</p>
<p>Although participants said the market has gradually been
discounting a possible outbreak of fighting between Iraq and
U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf area, as well as a
possible increase in the official discount rate by the Bank
of Japan, market psychology is still highly vulnerable,
according to Kimitoshi Hasegawa, head of separate account
management at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance.</p>
<p>But Yoshiaki Mitsuoka, director of investment information
at Daiwa Investment Trust & Management, cited a group of
shares that seemed generally immune to last week's plunge,
when the Nikkei Index lost more than 11% from Monday through
Thursday. In the group, he said, are bluechip shares such as
Hitachi, Matsushita Electric Industrial, Nippon Steel and
Kajima, which attracted buying Friday.</p>
<p>Hitachi was up 70 yen (48 cents) to 1,310 yen ($8.96) a
share, while Sony gained 250 to 7,100. Matsushita Electric
Industrial advanced 80 to 1,800, and Sharp was up 90 to
1,390. These electrical shares were boosted by investors
including institutions and foreigners, traders said.</p>
<p>Steel shares also firmed, with NKK gaining 43 to 493 and
Kawasaki Steel up 15 to 480. Among construction companies,
Kajima rose 70 to 1,390, and Taisei gained 29 to 979. Another
big winner was Toyota Motor, which advanced 120 to 2,000.</p>
<p>The London market, after reaching an intraday high in
early afternoon, slowed and began to retreat but still
managed to close in positive territory ahead of a three-day
holiday weekend. A trader for at least one securities house,
however, said his company was preparing to come to work today
despite the holiday, in case of a flare-up in the Mideast
crisis.</p>
<p>At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index stood at 2086.4, up 11.4 on the day but well below its
high of 2103.5. The Financial Times 30-share industrial index
was up 12.6 at 1616.8. Volume was 347.7 million shares,
considerably slower than Thursday's 492.6 million.</p>
<p>Interest rate-sensitive stocks had a good day amid
speculation that the strength of the pound will allow the
British government to ease interest rates.</p>
<p>Among construction-related stocks, BPB Industries rose 3
pence (5.9 cents) to close at 175 pence ($3.42) a share, and
Tarmac climbed 11 to 234.</p>
<p>The oil sector had the greatest losses of the day, as
profit-taking set in after Thursday's poor performance of oil
stocks on Wall Street. Ultramar fell 8 to 341, and British
Petroleum slid 5 to 354.</p>
<p>Wellcome, the pharmaceutical giant, dropped 21 to 423
after an unconfirmed report of a downgrading of its stock by
a U.K. brokerage house.</p>
<p>Trafalgar House lost 22 to 230. Rumors of a dividend cut
and of a seller in the market were said by one trader to have
triggered the fall.</p>
<p>In other European markets, shares closed higher in Paris,
Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Madrid, lower in
Milan and mixed in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, shares gained on pre-weekend covering of
short, or selling, positions and on bargain-hunting, traders
said. The German Stock Index rose 2.5% as large institutions
started buying after the market hit a 1990 low Thursday.</p>
<p>Another factor in Friday's bounce, one trader said, was
that the German Stock Index has fallen more steeply than the
Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past month, despite the
fact that the West German economy is considered stronger than
the near-recessionary U.S. economy.</p>
<p>South African gold stocks started showing signs of
recovery late in the session but still were down steeply in
active trading. The Johannesburg Gold Index fell 100 points
to close at 1808.</p>
<p>In other Asian and Pacific markets, prices closed higher
in Hong Kong, Singapore and Manila and lower in Sydney,
Seoul, Wellington and Taipei.</p>
<p>Sydney's All-Ordinaries Index skidded 1.6% after a 2.4%
fall Thursday, bringing its total decline to 4.8% for the
week. Brokers cited a combination of uncertainty about the
Middle East crisis, a sharply higher Australian dollar and
the volatility in the Tokyo market.</p>
<p>The gains in Singapore and Hong Kong were largely
attributed to technical factors, and brokers said the
advances are unlikely to hold unless Mideast tensions ease.
Taipei shares, meanwhile, fell 5.9% on a government decision
to raise oil product prices about 30%, brokers said. The
market's Weighted Index ended at a 30-month low of 3135.56,
down 197.9.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
