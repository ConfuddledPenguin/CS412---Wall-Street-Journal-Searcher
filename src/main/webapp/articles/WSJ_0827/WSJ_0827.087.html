	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- For more than 100 years, a simple philosophy
has helped make Hartmarx Corp. the unrivaled mass producer of
the American corporate uniform: All men's suits basically
look alike.
   From its top-of-the-line Hickey-Freeman to its low-priced
Sansabelt and Johnny Carson brands, Hartmarx boasts a
top-ranked 11% share of the U.S. men's suit market, little
changed in recent years. Sales in its 251 Wallachs, Baskin
and other retail stores and in department stores and
boutiques nationwide are $1.3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But all is not well for Hartmarx, or U.S. suit
manufacturers in general. More and more men are shunning the
traditional baggy, dark American suit for its more stylish
Italian and British competitors -- when they are buying at
all.</p>
<p>Hartmarx admittedly has been slow in responding to
consumer demand for greater variety in suit colors and in
remodeling stores that some customers find monotonous. "Our
problem is an image of old fogies," says Richard Goldman,
president of Hartmarx's Hickey-Freeman line.</p>
<p>Hartmarx is trying to fight back, altering suit design and
sales techniques, closing unprofitable stores and retiring
some executives. It is assembling an army of in-office
tailors, starting a "Suit University" for salesmen and
launching a sexually suggestive advertising campaign that has
shocked some of its own officials.</p>
<p>But it won't be easy to reverse Hartmarx's fortunes, which
include a three-year financial slump, including a loss of
$55.1 million after a special charge in the fiscal quarter
ended May 31.</p>
<p>On a recent shopping spree at a mall on Michigan Avenue,
Michael Volpe, a 34-year-old physician, ignores Hartmarx's
Baskin store and takes the mall escalator four floors up to a
suit boutique filled with designer labels, Bigsby & Kruthers.
Dr. Volpe, a short man with glasses and thinning hair,
doesn't look anything like an Italian model, but he is intent
on buying a flashy Giorgio Armani suit cut stylishly enough
for the cover of GQ magazine. As for Hartmarx suits, he says,
"Too drab, too dull, too boring."</p>
<p>Dr. Volpe and a woman friend sip white wine served up by a
Bigsby & Kruthers salesman. He is fitted in a $725
grayish-green Armani suit and two Italian ties priced at $75
and $57. His companion makes every decision, except which
credit card to use.</p>
<p>"Cuffs?" he asks between sips of chardonnay. "Yes," she
says, glancing up from a copy of GQ featuring Arnold
Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Richard Dawson is hardly a fashion
plate as he strolls into the same pricey store in a tank-top
shirt and gym shorts. But the suburban-Chicago airline worker
heads straight for an Italian-styled Andrew Fezza suit in
38-short.</p>
<p>Hartmarx stores are "for my father; he bought me my first
suit in one of them," says Mr. Dawson, who borrows a white
shirt and a pair of dress shoes to see if the $425 Fezza
flatters him. "Fezza? Is that European?" he asks.
American-style suits, it seems, just won't do.</p>
<p>Over recent years, sales of U.S.-made suits have slipped
24%, to 11.9 million in 1989 from 15.6 million in 1983. Sales
of imports rose 49% to 5.2 million from 3.5 million in the
period. Overall, Americans bought two million fewer suits of
any sort last year than seven years ago.</p>
<p>The hottest properties this year are pricey,
limited-distribution designer brands like Ermenegildo Zegna
and Joseph Abboud. "Anything with mustard color in it is
hot," says John Moran, manager of Ultimo Ltd. on Chicago's
fashionable Oak Street. He has sold more than 40 Zegnas, at
about $1,200 each, in two weeks.</p>
<p>GFT USA, a unit of Italy's Gruppo GFT, whose brands
include Armani and Abboud, estimates that its share of the
lucrative $300-and-up market has roughly doubled in the past
five years to 20%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many big names in the traditional U.S.
business-suit market are reporting problems. Marks & Spencer
PLC's Brooks Brothers, a standard-bearer of the Ivy-League
look, saw operating profit plunge 50% in the six months ended
last Sept. 30. Since then, it has stopped making operating
figures public.</p>
<p>Hartmarx officials heap blame for their troubles on
workplace upheaval and shifting life styles. They point to
the leveraged buy-out wave, which emptied many an office of
potential suit shoppers, as has the Wall Street retrenchment.
Grimly, they joke that many customers who used to buy two
suits a year now need just one -- for job interviews.</p>
<p>Further, many businesses are moving to suburban office
parks, where casual dress is more acceptable. The personal
computer allows some employees to work more at home, reducing
the suit to an occasional requirement.</p>
<p>The very fact that Hartmarx has such a big market share
makes it in some ways more difficult to change. Besides its
11% overall share, the company has 40% of the $300-and-up
suit market and 23% of the $200-and-up market.</p>
<p>Thus, Hartmarx officials worry about losing established
customers. And while trying to change with the times, the
company remains steeped in a tradition of practicality and
conservatism dating back to its founding in 1872, when Harry
and Max Hart opened their first clothing store on State
Street here, recognizing that many people had lost a lot of
their clothes to the great fire of 1871.</p>
<p>Hickey-Freeman suits still feature buttons made from
water-buffalo horns, a century-old custom, even though most
customers can't tell them from plastic. For 101 years,
Hickey-Freeman's slogan has been "Our suit feels old when
it's new and looks new when it's old." A Hartmarx sportswear
line is named after Bobby Jones, whose golfing prime was in
the 1930s; he has been dead 19 years.</p>
<p>The company is so slow to react to style changes that it
missed the leisure-suit boom of the early 1970s altogether.
It admits being at least a season behind competitors' recent
successful introductions of bright taupe and pearl-gray
suits. And when Hartmarx in recent years obtained the license
to sell such fashionable French labels as Christian Dior and
Pierre Cardin in the U.S., it stuck them on suits that lacked
the style the names implied.</p>
<p>Thus, it is little wonder the company's new-image ad
campaign has shocked some of its own executives. "I almost
didn't recognize you with your clothes on," a young woman
tells a male model in a forthcoming ad for Hickey-Freeman.
The ad ends by explaining that she had earlier ogled the man
in his jogging shorts.</p>
<p>Says Martin Landey, whose New York ad firm designed the
campaign, "Hartmarx must start bonding with younger buyers
who think its stores are boring places with suits for their
fathers."</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly leading these changes is Hartmarx
Chairman Harvey Weinberg. He is a plain-spoken former
salesman who used to mop the floor himself at his own store
on Chicago's South Side before joining Hartmarx 20 years ago.
He mothballed his predecessor's chauffeured limousine when he
took command three years ago.</p>
<p>Critics at the company say the 52-year-old Mr. Weinberg
has been too slow to change, for example keeping some
executives in critical jobs whose main accomplishment is
loyalty to him and the company. And he agrees. "It has
happened with some post-peak people. Maybe I'm too loyal, but
that's part of the culture of this company -- right down to
our second- and third-generation pressers," he says.</p>
<p>But in the last few months Mr. Weinberg has replaced six
of his top seven merchandising managers, and the
latest-quarter earnings included a $51 million charge to
close 65 stores. More field and headquarters executives will
go, he says. "Several significant old-timers I started out
with will be retired."</p>
<p>One Hartmarx tactic is to offer customers additional suit
brands. It now has 17, a big jump from a decade ago. Prices
range from $200 to $1,000.</p>
<p>Virtually all models now have some Continental touches,
like wider lapels and more imaginative color schemes. Blues
and grays, accounting for 93% of Hartmarx suits sold two
years ago, are a mere 30% now. And next spring, Hartmarx
plans to introduce a U.S.-made Italian imitator called
Pallesco, with suits costing up to $800. The risk, says
designer and fashion consultant Alan Flusser, is that the
added labels and altered designs may not be distinctive
enough, or may confuse customers and blur Hartmarx's image.</p>
<p>Another Hartmarx effort is the recent remodeling of its
flagship Baskin store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago at a cost
of more than $1 million. Gone are the worn yellow tile,
cheap-looking blond wood trim and generally cramped and
excessively bright quarters. The new flagship is twice the
original size, with green marble floors and stylishly dim
lighting.</p>
<p>Yet even here, Hartmarx doesn't stray far from its sedate
men's-club look. The new store is adorned with hunting
trophies promising to offend any shopper sympathetic to the
wildlife-protection movement. And though it is aimed at
younger men, dressing rooms picture Britishers in
17th-century wigs. A display of history books ends in 1939.</p>
<p>"I'm wondering if Baskin is an anachronism," says Edward
Johnson, a retailing consultant. Hartmarx officials say sales
are improving at the new store, but they won't provide
figures.</p>
<p>In February, Hartmarx opened Suit University, a four-day
course for floor personnel aiming to hone their sales
techniques. The first lesson takes a back-to-basics approach
-- way back.</p>
<p>"These are sheep," says Peter Huston, director of the
school, showing students a photo of woolly creatures grazing
on a Scottish hillside. "Point is, a lot of floor people
don't know where our product really comes from. You may win a
customer by explaining that we don't use wool from the rump,
or the underbelly."</p>
<p>A class of 24 students, some veterans of 30 years of
selling suits, tramps into the school's mock retail floor,
complete with hundreds of suits hanging from racks. Mr.
Huston presents a list of faux pas he says are chasing away
many suit shoppers.</p>
<p>Never jiggle change in your pocket within earshot of a
customer. "In his mind, the change jiggler is a hawk waiting
for a victim -- and he's a lazy bum. You should be dusting,
straightening the racks and taking care of the suits. Let the
customer see you're proud of the store," he says.</p>
<p>Don't ask, "May I help you?" Most customers subconsciously
resent this most common sales approach, says Mr. Huston. "It
implies the customer needs help just to get to the washroom
by himself. He wants expertise. Ask if you may show him some
suits that just arrived."</p>
<p>Don't let the customer try on a suit before a mirror until
you see that any needed alterations are minor. "If it looks
terrible, he'll just want to get it off his back and leave."</p>
<p>Don't apologize for the high cost of suits. Retail suit
prices are up 30% from three years ago. "The customer says,
`Gee, $465 is a lot for a suit.' The salesman tends to say,
`True, but everything is higher these days.' Well, don't say
that," says Mr. Huston. "Instead, say, `It isn't much,
considering the value of the relationships this suit will
help you build.'"</p>
<p>Another sales effort is the company's force of traveling
suit salesmen/tailors, such as Francisco Perez. The
29-year-old Mr. Perez, with a masters degree in marketing,
may ring up sales of $5,000 in a single visit to an executive
suite, although drumming up prospective customers takes up
much of his time. His prices are the same as those in stores,
and he doesn't accept tips. Such sales, begun last September,
are less than 1% of Hartmarx's total, but some officials see
them growing quickly.</p>
<p>Mr. Perez is most successful with customers who have
special needs, such as Lars Anderson, a leasing official for
some shopping malls, whose 6-foot-3, 315-pound body precludes
off-the-rack suits. Some salesmen throw up their hands at the
sight of him and push any garment close to fitting, Mr.
Anderson says. "Later, my fiancee says, `You look like a hog
in that.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Perez, who found Mr. Anderson through a referral,
quickly tells him Hartmarx suits can be custom-ordered in
special sizes and delivered in less than a month. He boasts
that the company made several Hickey-Freeman suits in a
63-long for football player William "Refrigerator" Perry.
(The largest store size is usually 56-long.) Mr. Anderson
agrees to buy three $1,000 suits from Mr. Perez. "I may not
look like a model," Mr. Anderson says, "but I'm still vain."</p>
