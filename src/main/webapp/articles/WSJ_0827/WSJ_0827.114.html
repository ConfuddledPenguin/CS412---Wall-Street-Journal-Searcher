	<p class="article-leader">Wellman Inc. said it completed the acquisition of New
England CRInc, and its subsidiary, Materials Recovery Inc.
   To complete the acquisition, Wellman issued about 300,000
shares of its common stock to CRInc shareholders valued at
$7.5 million, and retired about $4.5 million of CRInc's debt.
Before issuing the new shares, Wellman had about 32 million
common shares outstanding. For the first six months of 1990,
Wellman posted net sales of $418 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Wellman, based in Shrewsbury, N.J., a leading
manufacturer of fibers and plastic resins from recyclable
waste products, the acquisition of CRInc will mean a steady
source of raw materials. CRInc, a closely held company formed
in 1982 and based in Billerica, Mass., designs, builds and
operates recycling facilities. The company also has exclusive
North American rights to a West German technology that
mechanically separates waste products.</p>
<p>CRInc's shareholders plan to form a new limited
partnership to continue the firm's deposit container and
curbside pickups in New England, Wellman officials said.
Plastics collected by the company will then be sold to
Wellman under a five-year purchase agreement.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Wellman closed
at $17.625, up $1 a share.</p>
