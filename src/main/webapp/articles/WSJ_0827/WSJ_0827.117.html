	<p class="article-leader">Everest & Jennings International Ltd. reported a
second-quarter loss of $4 million, or 44 cents a share, and
said that its ability to continue domestic operations depends
on successful negotiation of a new credit agreement.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of wheelchairs and
other medical equipment, posted a loss of $5.5 million, or 68
cents a share. Sales rose 15% to $52.8 million from $45.9
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Everest & Jennings, which is based in Camarillo, Calif.,
said the losses have significantly hurt its financial
condition and its ability to obtain long-term financing. The
company said it took steps last week to cope with its cash
shortages, including laying off about 55 employees at its
main domestic plant in Camarillo.</p>
<p>Everest & Jennings said it has been trying to negotiate a
long-term financing arrangement with its primary domestic
lender. The company's credit agreement expired on Dec. 31.
Since then, the company has obtained periodic cash infusions
from its controlling shareholder, Industrial Equity (Pacific)
Ltd., a Hong Kong investment firm.</p>
<p>Barre L. Rorabaugh, president and chief executive officer,
said that Everest & Jennings's foreign subsidiaries are
profitable and are exceeding their projected performance for
the year.</p>
