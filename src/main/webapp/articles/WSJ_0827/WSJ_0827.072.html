	<p class="article-leader">Your July 30 article "In South Africa, Communists' Pact
With ANC Comes Under Pressure" quotes Jay Naidoo of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions as saying at a South
African Communist Party rally, "Apartheid has been proven to
be the most brutal and inhuman form of capitalism the world
has ever seen." This is an irresponsible and erroneous
statement, however emotionally appealing.
   Prior to the advent of legal apartheid, black South
African workers and farmers were competing successfully with
their white counterparts in the free-market economy. It was
because of this that the white government imposed
discriminatory labor and land-owning laws, hardly a
definition of "capitalism."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What black workers and budding entrepreneurs in South
Africa need is not more government intrusion, but less. To
jumble labels in such an emotional way is to prepare the
ground for tragedy, as has been proved by the recent plethora
of collapsed state-dominated economies, not least on the
African continent.</p>
