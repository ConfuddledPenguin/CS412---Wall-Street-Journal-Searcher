	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In the wake of a court decision that harshly
criticized the role of lawyers in the failure of Lincoln
Savings & Loan Association, thrift regulators promised more
enforcement actions against attorneys.
   Moreover, a Resolution Trust Corp. official, who asked not
to be identified, said the thrift-bailout agency is likely to
sue at least some of the attorneys connected with the
collapse of Lincoln, which is expected to cost taxpayers more
than $2 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Possible targets include the New York law firm of Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, which represented Lincoln
in a number of dealings with regulators and whose aggressive
tactics have been widely noted.</p>
<p>Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said the OTS plans to make enforcement actions
against lawyers -- and other professionals, such as
accountants, hired by thrifts -- a high priority in coming
months. Asked about the decision by federal Judge Stanley
Sporkin, which blamed lawyers for contributing to the Lincoln
debacle, Mr. Ryan said: "I agree with Judge Sporkin's view
and it's a view I hope you'll see reflected soon in
enforcement actions."</p>
<p>Harris Weinstein, OTS chief counsel, said the office plans
to use new powers granted in last year's thrift-bailout law
against attorneys and accountants. The law gave the OTS the
power in administrative actions to bar the professionals from
representing clients before regulators, bar them from
representing any federally insured institution, and impose
fines. However, the regulators believe these enforcement
powers don't apply to actions that occurred prior to when the
thrift law was passed and thus can't be used in the Lincoln
case. However, regulators can bring civil suits against the
lawyers and accountants who worked for Lincoln.</p>
<p>Judge Sporkin, who in his decision lashed out at Charles
Keating for "looting" Lincoln, raised questions about the
scores of accountants and lawyers hired by Mr. Keating. "What
is difficult to understand," Judge Sporkin wrote, "is that
with all the professional talent involved . . . why at least
one professional would not have blown the whistle."</p>
<p>Though Judge Sporkin found no indication that lawyers had
conspired with Mr. Keating's "illicit activities" he said the
attorneys should have been more attentive to the "public
interest." He expressed astonishment that lawyers and
accountants signed off on complicated business deals that,
the judge said, had no "economic substance."</p>
<p>The judge's high dudgeon was all the more notable because
the case had little to do with the actions of lawyers. The
ruling dismissed a suit brought by Mr. Keating contending
that regulators illegally seized Lincoln in April 1989.</p>
<p>Judge Sporkin didn't name specific lawyers or firms in his
decision, and most of the transactions he criticized were
apparently handled by in-house lawyers for Lincoln and its
parent, American Continental Corp. But Kaye Scholer was
responsible for at least one of the actions he assailed.</p>
<p>Judge Sporkin termed "unacceptable" a letter from Kaye
Scholer partner Peter Fishbein demanding that federal
examiners in Phoenix, Ariz., route their document requests
through Kaye Scholer in New York. Mr. Weinstein of the OTS
said that the lawyers assisted Lincoln in an "improper effort
to defeat the examination process."</p>
<p>"That's what the client asked us to do," answers Kaye
Scholer spokesman Stanley Robinson, a partner with the firm.
Mr. Robinson said that a compromise was reached in which a
Kaye Scholer associate worked with the examiners in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Judge Sporkin accused Lincoln attorneys of writing
"menacing letters" and preparing "ill-founded lawsuits" that
impeded government action. Mr. Robinson said he didn't know
what Judge Sporkin was referring to in these remarks, but
conceded that the latter might be a reference to a lawsuit,
prepared by Kaye Scholer, asserting that the regulators
leaked information. The lawsuit has since been dropped.</p>
<p>"As far as Kaye Scholar is concerned, we are satisfied
that there was no impropriety in anything we did for Lincoln
or American Continental Corp.," Mr. Robinson said.</p>
