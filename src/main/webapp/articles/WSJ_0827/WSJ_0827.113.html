	<p class="article-leader">GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. -- Federal Reserve policy
makers are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a
recession in the U.S., and lean toward a modest easing of
credit.
   But at the same time, Fed officials suggest they won't
move to cut short-term interest rates until financial markets
settle down. The crisis in the Middle East has caused the
U.S. dollar and the bond market to fall sharply in recent
days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's the conclusion drawn from interviews with a
half-dozen top Fed officials attending a conference here.
Some spoke for the record; others asked that their names not
be used. Their comments strongly suggest that at its meeting
this past week, the Fed's policy-making committee adopted a
directive that allows Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to reduce
short-term interest rates modestly in the next few weeks, if
market conditions allow. The panel adopted a similar
directive at its meeting in early July.</p>
<p>The two dissenting voices at last week's meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee appear to have been Fed Gov.
Wayne Angell and Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins, who
both opposed any tilt toward easing. Mr. Angell closely
watches the price of gold and apparently feels the rise in
that price over recent weeks suggests inflation fears are
building. Mr. Hoskins has long argued that the Fed should
hold to its inflation-fighting course regardless of
fluctuations in the economy.</p>
<p>It isn't clear, however, whether Mr. Hoskins and Mr.
Angell actually voted against the policy directive. The
official minutes of the meeting, and the details of the vote,
won't be disclosed by the Fed until after the customary delay
of six weeks.</p>
<p>The Fed's penchant for easing may come as a surprise to
many private analysts. Several of those attending the
conference here said they expected the Fed to hold its
policies unchanged in the wake of rising oil prices. "I don't
think they'll do anything," said Mellon Bank economist Norman
Robertson.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Middle East and the resulting rise in
oil prices present a particularly painful dilemma for Fed
policy makers. Rising oil prices will clearly add to
inflation, at least temporarily, over the coming year. But
the increased spending on oil will also be a serious blow to
economic growth.</p>
<p>"We know the economy is expanding through the second
quarter at a very slow rate, and at this rate it doesn't take
much to have a recession," said Fed Gov. Edward Kelley.</p>
<p>"It's obviously slow growth, and with what's happened to
oil prices, it's going to be even slower," said Dallas Fed
President Robert Boykin, who like Mr. Kelley is a voting
member of the 11-person Fed policy committee.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Kelley said that while he believes there
is a risk of recession, "it's not baked in the cake." And Mr.
Boykin, as well, said he isn't yet ready to conclude that
recession is inevitable.</p>
<p>Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey also expressed
concern about the growth rate. "If you had asked me before
the first of August, I'd have said we aren't going into a
recession," he said. "But today, I'm tempted to say `no
comment.' If you consider moving from $16-a-barrel to
$26-a-barrel oil translates into a $25 billion to $30 billion
hit to the economy, that's like a tax increase. It's going to
depress growth. It's a question of how long and how much."</p>
<p>Despite their concerns, however, none of the Fed officials
appears poised for an aggressive easing of policy. With
inflation a serious threat, any move to ease is certain to be
small. "The way to have a serious recession and a serious
economic problem," said Mr. Kelley, "is to allow inflation to
accelerate."</p>
<p>In expressing their concerns about the economy, some Fed
officials noted that the declines in home and stock prices
have undercut the wealth of many households. That, in turn,
seems certain to depress spending.</p>
<p>In addition, some Fed officials, including Chairman
Greenspan, remain concerned that tightening credit standards
among banks are pushing down economic growth. Mr. Guffey,
however, said he has no evidence that "credit is being denied
credit-worthy borrowers."</p>
<p>On Friday, the Fed released the minutes of the July 2
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Those minutes
showed that the policy makers leaned toward easing, and gave
Fed Chairman Greenspan the authority to ease slightly in the
subsequent weeks. The Fed cut the key federal funds interest
rate on July 13 to 8% from 8 1/4%. The federal funds rate is
the interest banks charge on loans to each other, and is
heavily influenced by Fed policy.</p>
<p>None of the 11 members of the Fed committee dissented from
the policy decision. In justifying their willingness to ease,
members noted tightening credit policies at banks and the
unusually slow growth of money supply.</p>
<p>Also at the July meeting, the Fed panel adopted new
targets for growth in money supply measures. Those targets
were disclosed when Mr. Greenspan testified before Congress
in July.</p>
<p>The minutes show that Fed Gov. Martha Seger was the lone
dissenter from a decision to lower the 1990 target for M3 to
1% to 5% a year from 2 1/2% to 6 1/2%. M3 is the broadest
measure of money supply. Ms. Seger said she feared the lower
range would present a risk to the economic expansion.</p>
<p>And Ms. Seger and Gov. John Laware both dissented from the
tentative targets for 1991. The committee voted to lower the
range for M2, which includes currency, checking accounts and
some savings accounts, to 2 1/2% to 6 1/2%, from 3% to 7%
this year. And the panel voted to leave the range for M3 at
1% to 5%. Ms. Seger dissented because she felt both ranges
were too low; Mr. Laware dissented because he felt the range
for M3 should be even lower, because of technical factors
resulting from the savings-and-loan industry crisis.</p>
