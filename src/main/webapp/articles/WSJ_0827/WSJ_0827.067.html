	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- The financial state and future prospects for
East German industry are not "hopeless," Claus Koehler, a
director of the Bundesbank said on West German radio.
   Mr. Koehler, who is the central bank's directorate member
responsible for credit markets, apparently is optimistic. "We
mustn't go on the assumption that we are in a hopeless
situation" regarding the health and outlook for East German
industry, the official said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said the central bank polled 140 enterprises with more
than 200,000 employees in East Germany over their
expectations, and said the Bundesbank was "astonished" with
the favorable nature of the replies.</p>
<p>Mr. Koehler said one-third of the respondents expect to
boost production, while another third foresee output trends
at current levels. Only one-third anticipate falling
production, Mr. Koehler said.</p>
<p>He added that the companies noted that the East German
economy is "fully ailing," but asserted that their prospects
aren't bad. "We know that we have to pass through a deep
valley that will be especially characterized by high
unemployment. But expectations are improving," Mr. Koehler
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Koehler also said that after Oct. 3, when the two
Germanys expect to merge, it would make sense for West
Germany to undertake an emergency financial cash infusion to
support the economically strapped area that is now East
Germany.</p>
<p>He said the West German government shouldn't raise taxes
to finance the cost of integrating and overhauling East
Germany, but should be willing to broaden its budget deficit
if necessary.</p>
