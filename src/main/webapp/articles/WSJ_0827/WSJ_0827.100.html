	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson said its rate of
pretax profit growth slowed to 14% in the second quarter from
94% during this year's first three months, and its share
prices tumbled on nervous world equity markets.
   The big Swedish telecommunications concern insisted its
biggest divisions are performing above expectations and
reaffirmed an earlier forecast for a 25% increase in
full-year profit before tax.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ericsson's American depositary receipts fell $13 to
$180.50 yesterday in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Ericsson management remained optimistic, dealing special
accolades to the U.S.-based joint venture for cellular phone
equipment formed with General Electric Co. last year.
Ericsson's chief executive officer, Lars Ramqvist, said sales
at the cellular venture with GE are running between 10% and
15% above the year's budgeted target of $1 billion.</p>
<p>He added that the Ericsson-GE venture has picked up market
share in the U.S. at the expense of local competitors and has
reached preliminary agreements with several big American
network operators to replace their existing cellular systems
with new ones from Ericsson. The Ericsson executive declined
to name any of the operators but said pending successful
completion of financing he expected announcement of several
major orders before year end.</p>
<p>Shrugging off the second-quarter profit slowdown, Mr.
Ramqvist insisted he was "more optimistic about the quality
of earnings now than after the year's first three months.
We're seeing a continued positive trends in markets that have
been strong the past few years."</p>
<p>Ericsson said profit before tax in the second quarter
climbed to 1.2 billion kronor ($208.3 million) from 1.06
billion kronor a year earlier. Sales in the period rose 22%
to 12.08 billion kronor from 9.9 billion kronor, the company
said.</p>
<p>First-half pretax profit surged 43% to 2.39 billion kronor
from 1.67 billion kronor the previous year, mainly due to the
strong first quarter. However Ericsson officials noted that
the first-quarter year-on-year comparison had been distorted
by heavy one-time charges that left last year's profit figure
unusually weak.</p>
<p>Installation of a cellular system that was under way in
Kuwait has been halted, Ericsson said. But company executives
added that operations in the Mideast were marginal,
accounting for less than 3% of sales and a smaller chunk of
profit in the first quarter.</p>
