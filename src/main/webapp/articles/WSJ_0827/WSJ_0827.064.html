   Pre-Empt Your Flight</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>WHILE MANY businesses are concerned by the U.S. call-up of
employees in the military reserves, the airlines have an
additional worry: the call-up of their aircraft. The military
use of some domestic airliners is causing a few disruptions
-- and there are signs it may get worse soon.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. told 29 carriers to make 38 commercial
jets available to fly troops and cargo to the Middle East, if
needed. Initially, airlines said the move wouldn't cause
cancellations.</p>
<p>But at least one, Pan American World Airways, now says it
canceled a handful of trips last week, including a
Washington-to-London flight that forced the rerouting of
numerous passengers. "The impact hasn't been major, but there
have been some disruptions," a spokesman says.</p>
<p>Other carriers either decline to comment or say they have
avoided such cancellations with spare planes. But they
acknowledge that would change if the U.S. keeps sending
troops to the Persian Gulf. (The situation also would change
if the airlines lose many pilots to the call-up of military
reservists.) The Defense Department isn't saying how many
commercial aircraft it might conscript, but it does say the
military relies heavily on civilian airliners to transport
troops.</p>
<p>"Obviously, if we send more troops we would be using the
civil fleet a lot more than now," says an Air Force
spokesman. He says that last week, the military actually used
about half of the 38 planes each day, allowing the airlines
to continue using the remaining aircraft.</p>
<p>Even if more jets are used, the airlines aren't likely to
complain. Under the call-up program, known as the Civil
Reserve Air Fleet, the airlines charge the government to send
the troops -- about $100 a passenger for each 1,000 miles
flown one way. That's enough to make a modest profit on each
flight, consultants say, and the call-up comes at a time when
air travel is down. "It gives the airlines some business just
when they need it," says Paul Turk, an airline consultant for
Avmark Inc. in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p>Travel Agents Compete</p>
<p>For Beauty Crown</p>
<p>TRAVEL AGENTS have put a lot of effort into trying to
improve their professional image; some now even earn special
travel agent degrees. But the annual Ms. Travel Agent Pageant
doesn't seem to fit into that effort.</p>
<p>For 28 years, women travel agents from across the country
have competed in the pageant, complete with swimsuit and
cocktail-dress competitions. Some agents aren't thrilled. "I
would hope a client wouldn't decide whether to buy a ticket
from me based on how I looked in a bathing suit," says Nancy
Morris, a chapter president for the American Society of
Travel Agents.</p>
<p>Still, the company that runs the contest, American/Wolfe
International, says it has received few complaints. "It's
just for fun," says Hans Engel, president of the Larchmont,
N.Y., company, which represents hotels.</p>
<p>Already more than 200 travel agents have applied for this
year's pageant, which will be held in Antigua in December.
Based on two photos each contestant sends in, American/Wolfe
will narrow the field to six agents, who will then parade on
stage. "We don't call it a beauty contest, but that's what it
is," says Mr. Engel. Still, he says, some professionalism is
required. "They must have been a travel agent for a year," he
says.</p>
<p>East Bloc Tourism</p>
<p>Rises Only Slowly</p>
<p>THE GATES to Eastern Europe are open, but tourists don't
seem to be using them.</p>
<p>To the dismay of travel agents who had predicted that
travelers would flock to the East bloc, U.S. travel there
appears to have risen only marginally. Complete figures
aren't in yet, but travel agents and tour operators say U.S.
travel to most East bloc cities has increased less than 10%
this summer from a year ago -- a far cry from the 25% to 30%
increases they had been expecting.</p>
<p>Many agencies say a shortage of hotels and tourist
facilities, as well as political and economic unrest in many
cities there, kept people away. One large tour operator, DER
Tours, says it canceled more than 25 departures this summer
to East Germany because the hotels there were sold out or
didn't meet Western standards yet. "The infrastructure just
isn't there," says Nigel Osborne, marketing vice president
for Trafalgar Tours, a London-based operator with New York
offices.</p>
<p>Still, agencies insist that travel will take off as more
hotels go up in Eastern Europe. "It should take about two to
three years for the real boom to hit," says Art Kienle, vice
president of travel products management for American Express
Travel Related Services.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>TELEVISION images of President Bush vacationing while U.S.
troops take up positions in the Persian Gulf may upset some
people -- but not necessarily the folks in Kennebunkport,
Maine. As the yearly summer home for the president, this
small resort town apparently is benefiting from all the
publicity about President Bush's three-week vacation there.
Town officials say tourism, way down in the rest of New
England, is up somewhat from last summer. Ironically, the
town blamed the president's presence for hurting tourism last
year, saying publicity about his visit scared off travelers
who feared large crowds. . . . Amtrak says bookings for
September are running 10% higher than last year. Officials
say concern about rising air fares, brought on by the Persian
Gulf crisis, is probably a factor.</p>
