	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The cash-rich Republican Party has come up
with a new fund-raising vehicle it plans to use to funnel
millions of dollars above federal spending limits to its 1990
Senate candidates.
   A new fund-raising committee, the Republican Senatorial
Inner Circle 1990, has already distributed more than $1
million to GOP Senate candidates in the past few months and
plans to disburse $10 million more, according to a recent
fund-raising solicitation sent out over the signature of Vice
President Dan Quayle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Inner Circle committee gives the GOP a significant new
weapon in closely contested senate races this year. It is the
brainchild of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
which in past election cycles has sought creative ways to get
around the legal ceilings on its donations to GOP nominees.
"This is industrial-strength fund-raising taken to the next
plateau," says William Canfield, a lawyer for the NRSC.</p>
<p>But several Democratic campaign strategists charge that
the Inner Circle is a ruse to circumvent legal spending
limits. "Every two years they come up with a scheme to put
illegal money into GOP campaigns," said William Sweeney, a
former top aide at the Democratic National Committee.</p>
<p>Common Cause's Fred Wertheimer also said that the 1990
Inner Circle committee looks like another attempt by the NRSC
"to get around the contribution limits. Our lawyers are
looking at it closely."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a federal judge here ruled in a suit
filed by Common Cause that the NRSC had illegally routed $2.7
million to a dozen of its Senate candidates in 1986 and
exceeded legal spending limits through a complex maneuver
called "bundling." On Friday, the Federal Election Commission
asked the federal court to assess a civil penalty against the
NRSC of as much as the entire $2.7 million.</p>
<p>But Mr. Canfield says the new plan is "so clean it's like
Caesar's wife."</p>
<p>Under federal election laws, the NRSC can use a committee
to direct individual contributions to candidates as long as
the money never technically passes through the NRSC treasury.
The Inner Circle must pay its own overhead and keep its
fund-raising separate.</p>
<p>The new committee supplants a fund-raising program the
NRSC has had for the last 11 years in which wealthy donors,
for annual contributions of $1,000, joined an "inner circle"
and were brought to Washington for issues briefings and
social events with GOP lawmakers.</p>
<p>In closely contested states such as Hawaii, Illinois,
Rhode Island, Nebraska and Iowa, as well as states like
Alabama and New Hampshire that the GOP also views as
competitive, the additional contributions from the new Inner
Circle committee will give Republican candidates significant
extra funding for television time and other crucial items.</p>
<p>The NRSC has raised a staggering $52 million this election
cycle, according to the Federal Election Commission, dwarfing
the $13 million raised by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. With this huge war chest, the NRSC is certain to
reach the maximum legal level of funding in many campaigns.
Legally, the NRSC and the DSCC can give as much as $17,500 to
each of its candidates and spend an additional sum, called
"coordinated expenditures," on behalf of candidates, ranging
from $100,245 in small states to $1.2 million in California.
Inner Circle contributions don't count toward these limits.</p>
<p>The Inner Circle has already disbursed contributions
ranging from $43,500 to $34,800 to 23 of the GOP's 1990
Senate candidates, according to the Federal Election
Commission. Twenty incumbent GOP senators who aren't running
in 1990 have each received $7,200.</p>
