	<p class="article-leader">Sun Microsystems Inc. dropped its planned public offering
of 5.9 million shares of new common stock.
   The computer maker, which is based in Mountain View,
Calif., had been having second thoughts about the plan to
raise $150 million through the offering because of the
stock's sharp dive since the proposal was announced 11 days
ago. At the time, the stock was trading at $32 a share, and
Sun had been seeking $31 a share for the new shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, the stock
closed at $27.625, up $1.25.</p>
<p>"We do not believe it is in the best interest of
shareholders to sell additional shares under current market
conditons," said Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman, president and
chief executive officer. Mr. McNealy said the company is
studying other options to raise capital, but that Sun doesn't
plan another stock offering any time soon.</p>
<p>Some analysts had criticized Sun for proposing the
offering just a few days after announcing a separate plan,
under a long-running agreement, to issue 4.6 million shares
to American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</p>
