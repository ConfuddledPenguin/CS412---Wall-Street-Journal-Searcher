	<p class="article-leader">HALL FINANCIAL Corp. (Dallas) said it was notified by one
of its principal lenders that the company is in default on
two working capital loans totaling $21.4 million. The
real-estate concern said the default notice wasn't triggered
by non-payment of the loans but by an alleged default on a
$6.5 million guaranty of a separate loan to an affiliated
partnership. The company said it is disputing the claims of
default and is in negotiations with the lender, which the
company didn't identify.</p>
