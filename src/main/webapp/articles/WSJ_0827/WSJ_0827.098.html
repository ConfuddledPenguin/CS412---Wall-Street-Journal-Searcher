	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- The South Korean government intends to supply
only non-lethal aid, and possibly transport support, to the
forces arrayed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf -- but is
hesitant to announce even that because of possible diplomatic
and economic repercussions.
   According to Korean journalists who had been briefed by
government officials, Seoul intends to provide boots,
uniforms, medicines, tents and other non-lethal aid to
Mideast allies of the U.S. No weapons or munitions will be
sent, but South Korea, one of the world's biggest users of
tear gas, will provide one of its specialties: gas masks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Korean officials refused to give details of the assistance
package to foreign reporters. "It isn't the right time to
make a comment," said Lee Joung Binn, assistant foreign
minister.</p>
<p>Providing aid to nations that might clash with Iraq is an
extremely delicate situation for Korea. Because Seoul is
totally dependent on imported oil, it balances its supplies
from among Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran and others, and
takes pains to offend no one. South Korea also has billions
of dollars in major construction contracts with both sides in
the conflict, and it doesn't want to put those in jeopardy.</p>
<p>South Korea also still has about 600 citizens in Iraq and
Kuwait and the South Korean government is owed about $138
million by Iraq and Kuwait. So it has tried hard to appear
neutral, while, analysts say, it struggles to fulfill its
responsibilities as an industrialized democracy with trade
ties to the U.S. and other countries committed against Iraq's
Saddam Hussein.</p>
