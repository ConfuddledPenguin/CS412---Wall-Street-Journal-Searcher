	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court has upheld a major
portion of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's rules
for deregulating the natural-gas industry.
   The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the
appeals court here could spur investment in the industry by
reducing the likelihood of protracted litigation that might
have followed a decision throwing out the commission's
actions. Industry officials said they haven't yet decided
whether to appeal this outcome, however.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At issue were the commission's terms for increasing
competition in the pipeline industry and dismantling the
so-called take-or-pay system. During the 1970s and early
1980s, when gas prices were high and expected to go higher,
many producers and pipelines entered into agreements under
which the pipelines agreed to pay top dollar for gas -- and
to take it even if they didn't need it -- in exchange for the
promise of long-term supplies.</p>
<p>A subsequent sharp drop in prices, however, left these
pipelines with expensive gas they had to buy but couldn't
sell. At the same time, in a series of deregulatory steps,
the commission was allowing distribution companies, utilities
and a range of other customers to buy gas directly from
producers -- at the lower market prices. Pipelines were
required to transport these customers' gas on the same basis
as they moved gas they owned.</p>
<p>In the court case, various producers, pipelines and
customers sought changes in the rules the commission
established for getting pipelines out of their take-or-pay
obligations and for ensuring that they provided all customers
with equal access to their transportation systems.</p>
<p>Because the status quo was upheld, with some minor
exceptions, the court decision isn't expected to raise or
lower consumer gas prices much. Moreover, many pipelines and
producers have already reached settlements of their
take-or-pay contracts, though a different court decision
might have led to a reopening of some of these agreements.</p>
<p>The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has led to a jump in oil
prices, which, if sustained, is likely to lead to an increase
in gas prices as well. That could renew interest in
longer-term contracts, but the regulatory restrictions that
surrounded the take-or-pay contracts would no longer apply.</p>
<p>Glen Howard, a partner at the law firm of Sutherland,
Asbill & Brennan, which represented industrial gas customers
in the case, said that "big jumps in gas bills" might have
resulted if the pipelines had been allowed to recover more of
their costs of buying their way out of their take-or-pay
contracts.</p>
<p>The commission had no comment on the court decision.</p>
