	<p class="article-leader">Monoclonal Antibodies Inc. said its merger with Quidel
Corp. has been put on hold because an investor who was
considering putting $7 million into the transaction has
gotten cold feet.
   Monoclonal Antibodies was to merge with Quidel by swapping
a total of 9.7 million Monoclonal shares for all Quidel
shares outstanding. At current prices, the transaction is
valued at about $30.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the over-the-counter market Friday, Monoclonal was
quoted at $3.125 bid, down 50 cents. At the time of the
initial announcement, the companies said they were
negotiating with David Blech, a private investor, for a $7
million equity infusion into Quidel before the merger was
completed. Monoclonal said Mr. Blech has decided not to do
that. He couldn't be reached to comment.</p>
<p>Monoclonal, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes diagnostic
test kits, primarily for fertility tests. Quidel, based in
San Diego, also makes diagnostic kits.</p>
