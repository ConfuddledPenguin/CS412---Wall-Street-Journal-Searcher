	<p class="article-leader">TURKEY'S KURDISH STRATEGY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In shaping their policies on the Gulf crisis, officials in
Ankara may have been thinking ahead to Turkey's problems with
the nation's large Kurdish minority.</p>
<p>While Turkey has refrained from military involvement, it
has cut off two Iraqi oil pipelines across its territory,
imposed a trade ban and prohibited neighboring Iraq from
using Turkish roads or airspace to transport goods.</p>
<p>Official sources and commentators suggest Turkey is taking
an active role in the crisis now so it will be listened to
later. The reasoning goes this way:</p>
<p>The U.S. appears determined to bring down Iraq's Saddam
Hussein and make the Persian Gulf oil fields secure. This
will probably lead to war and, eventually, a peace
conference. And Turkey would like to sit at the conference
table to make sure that its national interests aren't
jeopardized and that an independent Kurdistan doesn't emerge.</p>
<p>An estimated 20 million Kurds live in an area where the
borders of Turkey, the Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq and Syria
converge. Turkey has the largest group, an estimated 10
million out of its total population of 55 million. Several
thousand guerrillas have been fighting since 1984 for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.</p>
<p>HAVE FOOD, WON'T TRAVEL</p>
<p>Finding many doors on the European continent closed to
them, big British food-retailing chains such as Sainsbury,
Tesco, Gateway, Argyll and Asda are storming the weaker gates
of the U.K.'s own corner grocers and independent
supermarkets. Instead of pushing their shopping carts across
borders, the British groups are stocking up on U.K. sites for
"superstores." The new-generation supermarkets, made
appealing with high-margin fresh produce, are proving more
profitable than operating comparable big stores on the
continent, analysts say.</p>
<p>FAST TRACK</p>
<p>West Germany's federal railroad system expects to spend 40
billion marks ($25.9 billion) in the next 10 years on new
plant and equipment, including a high-speed train network.
The amount doesn't include the costly upgrading of East
Germany's timeworn rail system.</p>
<p>`BABY' GETS A GIFT</p>
<p>Ninety years after it officially became a commonwealth,
Australia has its "birth certificate." British Deputy Prime
Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe handed over to Prime Minister Bob
Hawke one of the two originals of the legislation, passed by
the British Parliament on July 5, 1900, that turned six
colonies into the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
<p>CAST OF CHARACTERS</p>
<p>Teams at the Asian Games in Beijing will march into the
opening ceremony Sept. 22 in order of Chinese characters,
organizers said. The nation with the name that, in Chinese
characters, has the smallest number of strokes will march
first while the country with the most strokes will be at the
end of the line.</p>
<p>WATCHDOG BITES</p>
<p>Hong Kong's watchdog Securities and Futures Commission
said it fined Y & C Property Investment Co. 15,000 Hong Kong
dollars (US$1,930) for issuing unauthorized advertisements
related to investments designed to help people secure the
right to emigrate to Canada. Hundreds of thousands of Hong
Kong residents are seeking second passports before the
British colony reverts to Chinese hands in 1997. Many
countries make immigration easier for those willing to invest
money, a factor that has spawned a sizable local industry
touting such plans.</p>
<p>BLEAK BULGARIA</p>
<p>Nine months after ousting its hard-line Communist leaders,
Bulgaria's political future is uncertain. Its economy is in
crisis and its population is frightened by the prospect of a
winter of starvation.</p>
<p>Shops and gas stations are empty, foreign investors are
deterred by huge foreign debt, and the new, freely elected
parliament can't agree on what kind of government will run
the country.</p>
<p>An increasing number of Bulgarians, frustrated by empty
stores and worried by the prospect of chronic shortages
during the harsh Balkan winter, are lining up outside
consulates for emigrant visas.</p>
<p>"This country is really on the ropes," one Western
diplomat said. "People are getting out for whatever reason
they can -- and I wouldn't want to be here this winter if I
were Bulgarian."</p>
<p>Like many of its East European neighbors, Bulgaria last
year ended the Communist monopoly on power. But while other
countries in Eastern Europe voted the Communists out of
power, in Bulgaria the party renamed itself Socialist and
swept to victory at free elections in June.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Sanctions against Iraq will cost 650 British workers their
jobs at a division of Rolls-Royce PLC that had a 75
million-pound ($146.6 million) contract to supply four
turbine generators to Iraq. . . . Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.,
of Japan, said it and Bank Dagang National Indonesia P.T. are
awaiting approval from both governments to open a jointly
owned bank in Jakarta.</p>
