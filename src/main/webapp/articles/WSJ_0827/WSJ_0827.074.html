	<p class="article-leader">As a lawyer and bioethicist, I was appalled by Bernard D.
Davis's suggestion (editorial page, July 31) that policies
concerning the discontinuation of life-sustaining treatment
should be determined by popular vote. There are many things
that can be determined by majority rule, but life and death
is not one of them.
   Whether or not a life that has been impaired severely by
irreversible loss of mental function is worth living is a
decision for the individual. Only when impairment is severe
enough to constitute death should anyone other than the
patient or the patient's designated representative have the
authority to stop treatment. Only the individual is in a
position to assess the value of his or her own existence.
Only the individual can transfer that right to another.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Perhaps we need to reconsider our definition of death.
Death used to mean the cessation of circulation of blood and
respiration. Today it means that and/or the total cessation
of brain function. If society redefines death to include an
irreversible loss of cerebral function, then at least people
in a persistent vegetative state and probably anyone who has
irreversibly lost consciousness would be dead and the issue
of robbing individuals of their rights to make treatment
decisions would be moot.</p>
