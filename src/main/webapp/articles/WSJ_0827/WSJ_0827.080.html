	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- NaTec Resources Inc., which believes it has a
cheap, simple solution to air pollution, is finding that Wall
Street can be as fickle toward new technology as a child is
about a new toy.
   The pollution-control company is expecting to get a big
boost from pending revisions to the Clean Air Act. But its
shares have subsided to $4 amid congressional squabbling over
the legislation. Under the name Industrial Resources Inc.,
NaTec's shares soared as high as $9 last year when Congress
put acid rain legislation high on its agenda.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To make sure it lands a big customer, NaTec has been busy
peddling its bargain-basement solution to acid rain-spraying
baking soda on flue gas emissions with jet nozzles. This
approach -- costing much less to install than the
better-known lime-based techniques -- transforms polluting
sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides into a disposable white
bleach.</p>
<p>But analysts say NaTec must snare a major contract for its
low-cost technology -- with or without passage of the law --
or its stock could fall even further.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows what the bloom looks like right now --
whether it's a rose or a weed," says analyst John Cabell of
Lovett Underwood Neuhaus & Webb Inc., Houston. Until NaTec
gets a big contract, it won't have the revenue to offset
widening losses caused by start-up research and development
costs. The company's first-half loss expanded to nine cents a
share from two cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>NaTec claims to have a special niche in the anti-pollution
market. The company is aiming at aging, low-sulfur,
coal-fired power plants that probably aren't worth the cost
of installing bulky, expensive systems that leave cleaner
air.</p>
<p>Much of the acid-rain abatement market will go to scrubber
manufacturers such as General Electric Co. and BBC Brown
Boveri Inc. Clean-coal technology will get another quarter of
the market. NaTec will be competing for the leftovers. The
company hopes to capture at least 7% of the market by 1995.</p>
<p>"It's going to be very useful where utilities do not have
to make a huge reduction but a marginal reduction," says
research assistant Michael Driscoll of UBS Securities Inc.,
New York. NaTec so far has signed only one contract -- with
Western Slope Refining Co. to reduce emissions for a
35,000-kilowatt coke plant in Fruita, Colo. NaTec officials
say they got positive reviews from Wisconsin Electric Power
Co. and Public Service Co. of Colorado. Neither company has
signed a contract yet.</p>
<p>"We still remain optimistic that we will receive one or
more large contracts before the end of the year," says Glenn
Hobratschk, chief financial officer. While expecting a loss
for 1990 of as much as $4 million, company officials say they
hope to see profitable quarters by late 1991.</p>
<p>Analyst David Bartlett of First Hanover Securities Inc.,
New York, is optimistic about NaTec's prospects. He predicts
that NaTec will "be in the black in 1991" and that a major,
100,000-kilowatt contract would mean five cents to 10 cents a
share in earnings. "You will be able to see the earnings
potential in 1991 that would make the stock vastly
underpriced," he says.</p>
<p>NaTec's executives expect the stock to rebound when
President Bush finally signs the sweeping new amendments to
the Clean Air Act requiring companies to clean up their
emissions. "The clean air passage is going to have a positive
effect on our stock. I don't see how it couldn't," says
Chairman Socrates S. Christopher. Mr. Hobratschk agrees that
"there will be a lot of excitement in the market" with
signing of the legislation. Significant benefits to NaTec
should materialize within six to 18 months, he adds.</p>
<p>NaTec's management has won praise from analysts for
setting up two long-term priorities: controlling raw
materials essential to its technology, and brokering
pollution credits for its clients. The company has secured
federal land leases in Colorado that contain more than 85
million tons of natural sodium bicarbonate. It recently
bought AERX, a Washington, D.C., trader of pollution-emission
credits, which will be expanded under the pending clean-air
legislation.</p>
<p>NaTec also can rely on the considerably deeper pockets of
CRSS Inc., seasoned engineers and architects. Formerly CRS
Sirrine Inc., the Houston company owns 44.8% of NaTec's
common shares.</p>
<p>"CRSS, in my opinion, will not let NaTec be a failure
because of lack of financial resources," says Mr. Cabell of
Lovett Underwood.</p>
<p>Analyst Robert W. McCoy Jr. of UBS Securities is
recommending NaTec indirectly through purchase of CRSS, which
trades on the New York Stock Exchange. But Mr. McCoy says
investors shouldn't expect short-term gains. "We expect a
gradual improvement in both stocks as contracts are signed,"
he says.</p>
<p>David Garcia of Howard, Weil Financial Corp., New Orleans,
is also pessimistic about major short-term gains for
investors, noting the gradual implementation of the proposed
clean-air legislation. The plan calls for stripping annual
emissions of five million tons of sulfur dioxide by 1995,
with another five million tons coming out by 2000.</p>
<p>Mr. Cabell says he's convinced NaTec's low-cost solution
works. It is just a matter of time, he says, before passage
of the clean-air legislation spawns a market for the
company's technology; until then it is a speculative stock.
"The expectations of the market for this company are very
high already," he says. "It's for an investor who realizes
the risk."</p>
