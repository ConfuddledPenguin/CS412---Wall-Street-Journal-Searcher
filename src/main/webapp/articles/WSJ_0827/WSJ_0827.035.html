	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bernard Chaus Inc. said it may purchase, from
time to time, up to $1 million of its common stock in the
open market, depending on market conditions. Officials said
this would be the first time it bought back shares this year.
They gave no particular reason for the timing of the
announcement, saying only that the company saw this as a
"good opportunity" to buy shares.
   Bernard Chaus is a maker of moderately priced women's
clothing, sold in department and specialty stores throughout
the U.S. For the nine months ended March 31, the company
reported net sales of about $221 million. Chaus shares closed
Friday at $2.75, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</p>
