	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Short interest among over-the-counter stocks,
both large and small, edged down in the month ended in
mid-August after small issues leaped the prior month and
larger issues edged up.
   TW Holdings Inc., Spartanburg, S.C., which owns and
operates restaurants, principally 470 Hardee's fast-food
outlets, led the issues with the largest increase in short
interest. Short position in the company rose more than one
million shares, to nearly 2.2 million. Last month it reported
second-quarter and six-month losses of $12.7 million and
$58.8 million, respectively, against net income of $20.8
million and $29.6 million. The losses were attributed to debt
and other expenses in the 1989 acquisition of TW Services
Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Acclaim Entertainment Inc., a major licensee of Nintendo
computer games based in Oyster Bay, N.Y., saw short interest
in its shares soar to 785,281 from 225,643 a month earlier.
Acclaim recently lifted restrictions on a block of its stock
held by entertainment giant MCA Inc., clearing MCA to sell
it. Also, it plans to make a new offering of two million
shares; current shares outstanding total 18.7 million.</p>
<p>Puget Sound Bancorp, Tacoma, Wash., had practically no
short position in the prior month, but in the recent period
short interest shot up to 544,633 shares. It was one of
several bank and thrift issues that were among the leaders in
short interest. Puget Sound, however, recently reported good
quarterly results and last month increased its dividend,
raising the possibility that investors were seeking to
capture the dividend.</p>
<p>First Executive Corp., a Los Angeles life insurance
company that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds, again
was the volume leader in short interest, with nearly 8.5
million shares, up from 8.3 million at mid-July.</p>
<p>Among the companies with the largest decreases in short
interest, Intel Corp. dropped 80%, to 588,393 shares from the
previous month's 4.3 million. The chip maker in July reported
substantial increases in profit and revenue for the second
quarter and six months.</p>
<p>Furon Co., a Laguna Niguel, Calif.-based maker of
polymers, had short interest practically disappear, to 6,700
shares from more than 900,000. The company in June announced
a plan to redeem a debenture issue for either cash or stock.</p>
<p>Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.</p>
<p>Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.</p>
<p>And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.</p>
<p>The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade
on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.</p>
<p>NASD reported that short interest in 2,335 National Market
System issues, the largest OTC stocks, totaled 255.5 million
shares at mid-August, down from a revised 256.9 million in
mid-July among 2,299 issues.</p>
<p>Short interest in 1,232 smaller securities traded on
Nasdaq declined to 37.7 million shares in August from a
revised 38.5 million in July among 1,212 issues.</p>
<p>The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-August fell to 2.19 from a revised 2.58 a month earlier,
while the short-interest ratio for other OTC issues climbed
to 1.06 from a revised 0.96.</p>
<p>The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.</p>
