	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- There are glimmers of hope for the dollar's
long-term health, even though short-run prospects are
decidedly bearish.
   The long-term picture is brighter because the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit is expected to shrink further,
helping to ease worries about the economy, some analysts say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, they contend, the dollar may fare better if the
mark faces tough times as German political union gets under
way in the fall and if the yen keeps suffering from Japan's
troubled financial markets and stubborn inflation.</p>
<p>Those factors are seen breathing some life into a currency
that's been pummeled by concerns about the weak U.S. economy
and forecasts for further Federal Reserve easing.</p>
<p>Although the dollar rose on flight-to-quality buying
Friday as the Iraq-Kuwait crisis continued, its track record
for the week was worrisome.</p>
<p>In late trading here Friday, the dollar was quoted at
1.5605 marks and 146.70 yen, up from 1.5444 marks and 146.15
yen late Thursday. But the dollar hit new lows of 1.54 marks
and 1.2553 Swiss francs Thursday, and the pound traded as
high as $1.9590 that day, the highest level in almost nine
years.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
145.30 yen, down from 145.70 yen at the close there Friday.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.5495 marks, up
from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.5466 marks.</p>
<p>In the long term, the dollar's fortunes could improve if
the U.S. trade gap keeps narrowing, some currency specialists
say.</p>
<p>While trade data haven't significantly affected the dollar
in the last few years, some market participants are now
latching on to the figures, calling them the dollar's
potential life preserver.</p>
<p>The trade gap narrowed to $5.07 billion in June from May's
$7.77 billion, contracting to a seven-year low as exports
rose to a record level and imports fell substantially.</p>
<p>The trade deficit totaled $45.81 billion through June, a
substantial reduction from the $54.36 billion gap a year
earlier.</p>
<p>The dollar's weakness is expected to keep exports on track
by making U.S. goods cheaper for foreigners, fueling demand.</p>
<p>But imports aren't expected to decline much in the near
term because higher oil prices are seen offsetting any
declines that may be caused by sluggish consumer demand.</p>
<p>In all, though, economists are generally encouraged by the
trade picture.</p>
<p>"On the trade front, you can be optimistic" and have some
hope for the dollar, says Michael Moran, chief economist at
Daiwa Securities America Inc. "We could see substantial
improvement {in the trade picture} and I would think that
would be good for the dollar."</p>
<p>Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics
Ltd., agrees. "I see a couple of constructive things
happening for the dollar. One is a long-term improvement in
the trade balance," he says.</p>
<p>The trade picture aside, some currency analysts say the
dollar has the potential to strengthen a little against the
mark and the yen in coming months.</p>
<p>In dollar-mark dealings, the dollar's fortunes could turn
if any rough spots in German unification hurt the mark, some
analysts say.</p>
<p>West Germany's economy could suffer if unification causes
higher taxes, greater unemployment and any further plant
shutdowns, says Earl Johnson, a foreign-exchange adviser at
Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago.</p>
<p>"That's the kind of scenario that could get the dollar" up
against the mark, possibly to 1.65 marks to the dollar by
year-end, Mr. Johnson says.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson sees the dollar at 145 yen at the year's
close, not far below the current level. The dollar, he says,
stands a good chance of remaining buoyant against the yen:
Investors are staying clear of Japan's financial markets and
any disruption of Japan's oil supply because the Gulf crisis
could aggravate the nation's inflation problem.</p>
<p>While brighter times could be ahead for the dollar, there
are few expectations that its troubles will be over anytime
soon.</p>
<p>With the U.S. economy wobbly and the Federal Reserve seen
poised to ease credit in the next few months, more heavy
dollar losses are seen probable in the near term.</p>
<p>Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday,
gold for current delivery settled at $415 an ounce, up $3.
Estimated volume was a moderate 4.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Monday, there wasn't any trading in gold
because of a holiday.</p>
