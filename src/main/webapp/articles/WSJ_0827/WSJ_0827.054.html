	<p class="article-leader">Isle Royale National Park -- "I love the wilderness," says
Reino Koivunen. "I like cooking and camping and sleeping
outdoors. People who stay in motels don't have exciting
vacations."
   Millions of Americans profess those sentiments, but Mr.
Koivunen, of Laurium, Mich., is unusual. He's 82, and not
many people that old take to the woods. What's more, last
month Mr. Koivunen spent five days hiking and fishing on this
pristine, primitive island in the middle of Lake Superior,
which draws few people of any age.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Isle Royale had just 27,000 visitors last year -- making
it the nation's least used national park outside Alaska. At a
time when national parks look increasingly like traffic jams
surrounded by trees, Isle Royale may be one of the few
remaining parks where a great escape remains possible.</p>
<p>The busiest of the 50 national parks is Great Smoky
Mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina. It drew 8.3
million visitors in 1989 -- almost as many per day as Isle
Royale got in the entire year. In contrast, Gates of the
Arctic park in northern Alaska attracted just 822 hardy
souls, making it low man on the totem pole. Besides that
park, only two other parks in Alaska were more lightly trod
than Isle Royale, which is the largest island in the world's
largest lake.</p>
<p>It's easy to understand why. Even though Isle Royale and
Detroit are in the same state, it's faster and easier to
travel from the Motor City to Great Smoky Mountains park than
to this island wilderness. Both journeys require driving more
than 550 miles. But after that, it's a minimum 4 1/2-hour
ferry ride to Isle Royale.</p>
<p>The boat trip is usually pleasant in midsummer, though
even in July you sometimes see your breath when you walk out
on deck because Lake Superior's water is so cold. But this
Great Lake (a.k.a. Gitche Gumee) can be capricious. "Last
year we had a group of girls on an Outward Bound trip, and
the lake got a little choppy," says Donald Kilpela, owner of
the Isle Royale Queen III, based in Copper Harbor, Mich. "So
many girls were hanging over the side of the boat throwing up
that we called it the communion rail."</p>
<p>Also, consider the rigors of the island itself, which can
be visited mid-May through October. Isle Royale has a lodge
($70 a night per person, double occupancy, with all meals
included) or visitors can do their own cooking in individual
cabins ($38 per person double occupancy, with additional
guests $10.50 each).</p>
<p>But most people leave the two "ports of entry" (Rock
Harbor and Windigo) and seek solitude by camping out. The
handy wood-and-screen lean-to shelters that dot the island's
campsites are a cut above tents, but the experience still
isn't exactly Club Med.</p>
<p>Campers are warned to boil or filter thoroughly all the
water they drink. The problem isn't man-made pollutants, but
parasites that live in Isle Royale's animals. The main
culprits are the echinococcus granulosus tapeworm (it can
grow as long as its name) and the giardia. The latter, says
the park's special leaflet on drinking water, is a protozoan
that causes "backpackers disease or beaver fever," which is
characterized by diarrhea, cramps and "great abdominal
discomfort." The leaflet adds: "The diseases mentioned in
this brochure probably won't kill you, but they may make you
wish you were dead."</p>
<p>Ironically, all these obstacles are part of the lure of
Isle Royale. After all, it's great to return home and say
you've visited a place that few other people will ever see.
Those who paddle a canoe to Ryan Island in the middle of Isle
Royale's inland Siskiwit Lake even can boast that they walked
on "the largest island on the largest lake on the largest
island on the largest lake in the world."</p>
<p>But Isle Royale offers far more appeal than bragging
rights. "It's God's country; everything is so peaceful," says
Ron Feldpausch, a building contractor from Fowler, Mich., who
recently visited Isle Royale for the first time to hike and
camp with his two teen-aged sons and a 20-year-old nephew.
"On one of our canoe portages we saw a bull moose, and later
on we saw a mother moose and her baby swimming across a
lake."</p>
<p>Researchers estimate that some 1,200 moose live on Isle
Royale, along with 14 wolves as of last winter. The wolf
population stands at just half of its long-term average, and
scientists are intensely studying what's wrong and what -- if
anything -- to do about the situation.</p>
<p>The mosquitos are faring far better than the wolves.
"During the daytime there are no bugs whatsoever, but when
the sun sets you had better get inside a tent or a shelter,"
says Mr. Feldpausch. "The mosquitos are so thick that when
you're in a tent it sounds like you're in the middle of a
beehive."</p>
<p>Return visits are old hat to Mr. Koivunen, a retired
lawyer and probate judge. He made his first trip in 1931, the
year that Isle Royale became a national park. Since then he's
returned 20 times, most recently in the company of his son,
grandson, and his "little brother" John, who's only 72.</p>
<p>Mr. Koivunen likes exploring the island on foot, and
fishing around its perimeter from a rented motorboat. The
scenery is spectacular, partly because Isle Royale is really
an archipelago whose main island is surrounded by dozens of
others -- many of them tiny outcroppings.</p>
<p>"I like seeing the moose and the foxes," says Mr.
Koivunen. "In all the years I've been there, I've never seen
a wolf. But maybe I will next year. We've already made plans
to go back."</p>
