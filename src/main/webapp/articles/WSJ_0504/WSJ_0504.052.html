	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar ended little changed against major
currencies as the market pondered a full slate of
uncertainties, including German monetary unification, today's
U.S. employment data, local British elections and Sunday's
meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
   Holidays in Japan yesterday and today added to the
market's caution.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With so many reasons for restraint, "people are being very
slow about what they're doing," commented Charles Spence,
vice president of foreign exchange at First Interstate Bank
of California in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Dollar dealings against the mark were muted as the market
digested Wednesday's accord on monetary merger between the
Germanys, traders said.</p>
<p>The agreement, which will take effect July 2, is
encouraging participants to maintain long mark positions in
anticipation of an eventual rise in West German interest
rates to cope with the pact's possible inflationary
consequences, Mr. Spence said.</p>
<p>Participants also think they can't sell the mark too
aggressively because recent drops in the West German currency
against the dollar have proved temporary, said Joe Sabbagh,
chief trader at European American Capital Corp. in New York.</p>
<p>Confidence in the Bundesbank's willingness to raise rates
when it becomes necessary, along with the understanding that
the full impact of monetary unification will take some time
to disclose itself, will help the mark weather short-term
uncertainty over the effects of monetary unification, Messrs.
Sabbagh and Spence agreed.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the mark isn't likely to fall steeply,
as the yen did when the market was waiting for the Bank of
Japan to raise interest rates, Mr. Spence added.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank central bank council didn't raise rates at
its fortnightly meeting. After the meeting, Johann Wilhelm
Gaddum, a director of the Bundesbank, said the central bank
can support the monetary union agreement, explaining it isn't
too different from the bank's original concept of monetary
unification.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6827 marks, down from 1.6848 marks late Wednesday, and
at 158.05 yen, up from 157.95 yen late Wednesday. Sterling
was quoted at $1.6410, down from $1.6425 late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Despite the factors supporting the mark, traders said an
improving economic picture in the U.S. and the possibility of
higher U.S. interest rates will keep the dollar from slipping
against the German currency, resulting in a stalemate of the
two units.</p>
<p>The market is watching today's release of U.S. employment
data for April as an indicator of what action, if any, the
Federal Reserve might take on interest rates, Messrs. Spence
and Sabbagh said.</p>
<p>Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to have risen by
384,000, compared to an increase of only 26,000 in March. The
unemployment rate is seen remaining unchanged from March at
5.2%.</p>
<p>The figures probably will give the dollar a boost if they
are in line with expectations or better, but will cause the
U.S. unit to weaken if they are worse than expected, by
inspiring speculation that the Fed might lower interest
rates, Mr. Sabbagh said.</p>
<p>And in spite of a statement by a senior U.S. Treasury
official that the G-7 finance ministers and central bankers
aren't likely to take new action to support the yen, the
market is treading cautiously in the area of yen rates. They
fear a surprise announcement on the Japanese currency after
Sunday's meeting in Washington, participants said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, participants interested in the pound are
waiting to see how British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party fared in yesterday's local council
elections. In early returns, the party was losing heavily.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $1.90 to $371.40 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a light 1.8 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at $371.25 an
ounce.</p>
