	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A.C. Nielsen Co. yesterday told executives
from the television networks and advertising agencies that it
has no idea why its recent TV ratings show a sharp decline in
television viewing.
   Nielsen ratings, which dictate how billions of dollars are
spent on television advertising each year, indicate that TV
viewing is down 8.1% for daytime programming, off 2.2% in
prime time and is down a sharp 14% for nightly newscasts for
the three networks in recent months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nielsen, which met privately with about 100 members of the
advertising and broadcast community in a 90-minute session at
a New York hotel yesterday, pledged to research the ratings
drop further. But some executives remain dissatisfied. "I
don't feel Nielsen has given us anything new," said Michael
Eisenberg, a vice president at CBS Inc. "We still think there
really is a problem."</p>
<p>Executives of Nielsen, a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. unit,
declined to comment on the meeting yesterday, although one
conceded privately that the "magnitude of these changes {in
viewing} is the largest in recent memory and warrants serious
examination."</p>
<p>Even ad executives, who in the past have tended to dismiss
the network complaints about the Nielsen people meters,
express concern at the latest numbers. "There is a fly in the
ointment," said Joel M. Segal, executive vice president at
the ad agency McCann-Erickson, a unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos. "It's madness. We can't figure out {the demographics}
we're buying."</p>
