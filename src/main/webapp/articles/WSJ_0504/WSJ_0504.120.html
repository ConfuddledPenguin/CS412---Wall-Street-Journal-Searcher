	<p class="article-leader">National Broadcasting Co. disposed of its 14.7% stake in a
New Zealand network after bankers withdrew financing from the
foreign concern.
   NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn.,
said it tendered or "put" its minority stake in New Zealand's
TV-3 to other partners in the venture. New Zealand law bars a
foreign entity from managing or controlling the network, and
NBC therefore declined to pump more money into the venture.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Terms weren't disclosed. J.B. Holston III, the NBC vice
president who had negotiated the stake, didn't return calls
seeking comment. NBC's stake was "put" to the brokerage firm
Ord O'Connor Grieve Ltd. and to TV-3 shareholders Metro Media
Ltd. and South Pacific Travel Ltd. after TV-3's main banker,
Westpac Banking Corp., withdrew funding.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that NBC will make a profit on its
investment, whose size wasn't disclosed.</p>
