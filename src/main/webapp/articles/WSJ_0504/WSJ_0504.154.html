	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- After tumbling nearly 15% in the first three
months of 1990, Spanish equities are staging a comeback. But
analysts are split on how long the rally will last in the
face of some troubling questions about the immediate future
of Spain's economy.
   A number of factors dogged Spanish stocks during the first
quarter, including persistent concerns about inflation and
the trade deficit, the sluggish stock-market performance
world-wide and general weakness in the Spanish banking sector
-- which accounts for nearly 31% of the main market
barometer, the Madrid Stock Index.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But some of these trends have since turned around. Bank
shares are now recovering, thanks in large part to strong
first-quarter earnings. Foreign money, which according to
some estimates makes up as much as a quarter of the Madrid
market, is beginning to trickle back as prospects on other
world bourses deteriorate and euphoria about Eastern Europe
subsides.</p>
<p>In addition, some market bulls say that the government's
budget, announced on March 1, is less restrictive than
anticipated. They note that a projected 40% rise in
infrastructure spending could give some sectors, particularly
construction, a hearty boost.</p>
<p>And while economists aren't predicting a sharp drop in
Spain's inflation rate nor a significant narrowing in the
current international payments account deficit any time soon,
some contend both are heading lower.</p>
<p>"No one is saying everything in the garden is rosy, but
the trend looks better . . . the rate of deficit growth is
slowing as well as the inflation rate," says Amanda Sisson at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in London.</p>
<p>Forecasts for the market over the next three months vary,
with some bulls predicting the Madrid Index will climb back
over the 300 level, where it was before the market entered a
tailspin in January.</p>
<p>But others contend that without more clear-cut signs of
economic cooling, a sustained stock market rally isn't
likely. The market's bears see the index holding at around
270 before losing some ground.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the index closed at 273.79, up from 272.22 on
Wednesday. It had slipped to about 250 in early April from
above 300 in January and 340 at its peak last year.</p>
<p>Among the factors contributing to the market's dismal
first-quarter performance, analysts say, was the diversion of
investor interest to the hefty returns -- ranging from 14% to
16% -- on fixed-income securities.</p>
<p>Unease over Spain's recent economic performance also
contributed to a slip in the volume of foreign interest.</p>
<p>Economists point to the big jump in February inflation as
especially worrying.</p>
<p>Despite the government's determined efforts to cool
Spain's economy, the nation's year-on-year inflation rate
jumped to 7.3% in February from 6.7% in January and 6.2% a
year earlier.</p>
<p>But Judith Kleinman, an analyst with Capel, argues that
February's inflation figures may have been no more than "an
aberration" in view of March data that showed year-on-year
inflation easing back to 7%.</p>
<p>Analysts say the key to the market's resurgence lies with
bank stocks. The banking sector has already begun to dig
itself out of the doldrums, Capel's Ms. Kleinman says.</p>
<p>The banks had the wind knocked out of their sails early
this year when, in a bid to put the brakes on Spain's booming
economy, the government imposed stringent credit controls on
private-sector lending.</p>
<p>The central bank also introduced a 30% mandatory deposit
requirement on foreign currency borrowings by Spanish
companies early last year to discourage them from raising
funds abroad. Most companies expected the requirement to be
lifted early in 1990; the government's decision to keep the
controls in place added to the market's woes.</p>
