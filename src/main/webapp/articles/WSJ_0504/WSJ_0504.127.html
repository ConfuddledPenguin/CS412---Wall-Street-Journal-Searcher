income, hurt by the nationwide slump in newspaper
advertising.
   The results were slightly worse than analysts had
expected. Net fell to $39 million, or $3.16 a share, from
$41.5 million, or $3.22 a share. Analysts had expected
per-share earnings from $3.25 to $3.30.</p>

million. At the Washington Post, the flagship paper that
provides more than half of the company's total revenue, ad
linage dropped 6%, although higher ad rates kept revenue
flat.</p>
<p>At Newsweek magazine, the second-largest source of company
revenue, sales declined 5% as ad pages fell 14%. Revenue at
the broadcast division dropped 8%. But cable revenue rose
11%, while revenue from Kaplan Educational Center was up 17%.
The company doesn't disclose earnings of the individiual
divisions.</p>
