	<p class="article-leader">Reliance Group Holdings Inc. said earnings declined 64% in
the first quarter primarily because of "difficult market
conditions in some lines of business."
   Profit fell to $9.6 million, or 13 cents a share, from
$27.1 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 8% to $924.7 million from $854.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit from property and casualty insurance operations
dropped 66% to $22.7 million from $67 million. New York-based
Reliance blamed price competition and a decline in premiums
written in 1990. However, income from life insurance as well
as title and mortgage insurance rose.</p>
<p>Reliance has reported that its $630 million sale of its
General Casualty Insurance Co. subsidiary will result in a
$380 million pretax gain in the second quarter.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Reliance closed at $5.625 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>RELIANCE GROUP HOLDINGS Inc. said first-quarter earnings
declined primarily because of a large year-earlier gain from
the sale of an equity investment. Yesterday's edition
incorrectly attributed the drop mainly to market conditions.</p>
