	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The French government intends to propose a series
of initatives on easing the debt problems of middle-income
countries, French Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy said
this week.
   Mr. Beregovoy didn't elaborate, saying that he will
outline the proposals to the policy-making Interim Committee
of the International Monetary Fund when it meets in
Washington next week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Beregovoy singled out the Ivory Coast, the Congo,
Gabon and Cameroon as countries that have a higher per-capita
gross national product than the poorest sub-Saharan
countries, but are nonetheless saddled with a heavy debt
burden.</p>
<p>The fact that most of this debt is owed to governments and
state agencies means that these countries can't benefit fully
from the so-called Brady initiative that was launched in
1989. The initiative switched the focus of the debt strategy
from new lending by banks toward the lowering of countries'
commercial bank debt.</p>
<p>Mr. Beregovoy has criticized the Brady initiative's
shortcomings in the past, saying it is too slow to implement
and has limited effectiveness.</p>
<p>Since the autumn of 1988, France has been proposing the
creation of an escrow fund that would guarantee the payment
of principal and interest on securities created by
debt-conversion operations.</p>
<p>A recent study by the IMF and the World Bank has concluded
that the Brady initiative hasn't worked as well as had been
hoped, chiefly due to the lack of sufficient resources and
the lack of support from commercial banks.</p>
