	<p class="article-leader">When grocery store owner Ira Waldbaum decided to sell the
chain bearing his name, he told his sister, who told her
daughter, who told her sister, who told her husband, who
either did or did not tell his stockbroker -- who bought the
company's stock. This may sound like a flimsy scenario to
establish insider trading, but it was enough to make the
posse of former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and the
Securities and Exchange Commission saddle up. On Wednesday, a
federal appeals court ruled that this case should never have
been brought.
   The news reached Robert Chestman in his cell at Allenwood.
He was doing time there for the crime that he did not commit
-- and that the judges ruled does not exist. The case against
Mr. Chestman, the former broker, would be laughable if it
weren't for his anguish and the confusion his conviction
caused about what if anything "insider trading" means. Here's
what happened:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1986, the Waldbaums decided to sell their stores to
A&P. Ira Waldbaum called his sister to have her gather her
stock certificates. Elderly and in poor health, she asked a
daughter who lived with her to drive her to get the
securities. The daughter called her sister, Susan Loeb, to
arrange car pooling for their children. Mrs. Loeb was anxious
that her mother might be ill, but the mother said the trip
was just to pick up the certificates. Mrs. Loeb told her
husband. The prosecutors claimed that Mr. Loeb then called
his broker, Mr. Chestman, to say he had "some definite" but
undisclosed information that Waldbaum stock would rise. Mr.
Chestman bought the stock.</p>
<p>This was not an obvious
suitcases-of-cash-for-inside-information crime a la Ivan
Boesky. Indeed, Mr. Chestman claimed all along that he bought
the stock because of takeover rumors and before speaking to
Mr. Loeb. He would have been a fourth-level tippee of market
information. The prosecutors insisted that Mr. Chestman
violated their "misappropriation theory," which essentially
says that anyone who has more information than someone else
is a potential criminal.</p>
<p>Mr. Chestman was indicted and convicted on 31 counts of
insider trading, perjury and mail fraud. The legal theory was
that he had aided and abetted Mr. Loeb in violating his duty
to his family. In May, trial Judge John Walker Jr. threw Mr.
Chestman in the slammer for two years and fined him $250,000
"to send a message to Wall Street and the financial community
that those who cheat the markets out of greed must pay a
price for their conduct." The SEC took away Mr. Chestman's
broker license. Because he couldn't get a job doing anything
until he'd done his time, he went to jail pending the appeal.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the appeals court rejected the entire
prosecution case. The most stunning reversal came when two of
the three judges invalidated an SEC rule adopted in 1980 that
has been the favorite of overzealous regulators. Rule 14e-3
makes it a crime for someone to trade if he simply possesses
"material information," even if it was someone else who
violated a duty to get it.</p>
<p>Judge Daniel Mahoney said the SEC does not have the power
to issue a rule criminalizing trades where the defendant did
not himself breach some fiduciary duty to get the
information. Judge Mahoney emphasized the "rule of lenity,"
which holds that people mustn't be convicted when the law is
vague and unpredictable.</p>
<p>The Second Circuit in New York has upheld many 14e-3
convictions. We suspect the accumulated abuses in this and
other Giuliani white-collar cases persuaded judges in this
case to send a message. When the judges reviewed the record
of the trial, they found slim evidence that Mr. Loeb had even
spoken with Mr. Chestman before the trades, and that there
was much evidence that he hadn't. They threw out the perjury
convictions. And they rejected the mail-fraud charges because
Mr. Chestman had not committed any fraud at all.</p>
<p>The 14e-3 issue aside, all three judges said that even if
Mr. Loeb had passed on information that Waldbaum stock would
rise, this would not have made Mr. Chestman a criminal.
"After passing through several family channels, it cannot be
said that the information was confidential to any degree or
was any more than `family gossip,'" Judge Roger Miner wrote
for the court.</p>
<p>At least in the New York jurisdiction, the law again makes
sense: Do not trade information if you have a contractual or
other legal duty not to steal the information, but it's safe
again to dig out and analyze information in the markets
without worrying about Allenwood. Faced with many appeals of
convictions in other 14e-3 cases, the SEC will probably lobby
the New York prosecutors to appeal. Or maybe Congress will
finally write a clear, bright-line definition of insider
trading; we'll cross our fingers that Congress doesn't make
the law more confusing.</p>
<p>If there's any justice, U.S. v. Chestman will be a
precedent for more reversals as other questionable
convictions make it to the appeals courts. It may be
coincidence that this decision comes a week after the Milken
plea. But prosecutions under the vague "misappropriation
theory" are the foundation on which many created the larger
notion that the whole market now consists of significant
illegal activity. No one rode this harder than Rudolph
Giuliani, who prosecuted Mr. Chestman shortly after the
Boesky conviction. Now the court has made clearer who in the
market is a criminal and who is not a criminal.</p>
