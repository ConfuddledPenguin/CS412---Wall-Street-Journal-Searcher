	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Traders pushed bond prices moderately higher
as they rushed to cover short-sale positions ahead of today's
potentially market-moving employment report.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended nearly 1/2
point higher, a gain of about $5 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, slipped below 9% and finished at
8.97%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities and high-grade
corporate bonds ended as much as 1/2 point higher. Most junk
bonds were unchanged.</p>
<p>Institutional investors remained on the sidelines, which
is typical prior to the release of the employment report.</p>
<p>But dealers and speculators were active buyers as they
moved quickly to unwind money-losing short positions. In a
short sale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek
to make a profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities. Essentially, these dealers are betting that
prices will fall.</p>
<p>Many short positions were placed early Wednesday, on
speculation that bond prices would fall after the Treasury
announced details of next week's quarterly refunding, where
the government will sell $30.5 billion of securities. But
when bond prices rose instead, they were forced to enter the
market to buy bonds at higher prices.</p>
<p>Analysts said another reason for the dealers cashing out
their short positions was fear that the employment report
will have a positive impact on the bond market and cause
prices to rise even higher.</p>
<p>Although economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets
Report believe nonfarm employment rose a strong 384,000 last
month, the increase was distorted by an estimated 211,000
census workers, according to the economists. The unemployment
rate is expected to be unchanged at 5.2%.</p>
<p>Statistics in line with expectations shouldn't have much
impact on bond prices. But the jobs data, considered one of
the most important of the monthly economic releases, are
difficult to predict, and surprises often jar the bond
market. The April statistics are seen as especially
significant because they are likely to set the tone at next
week's Treasury refunding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the federal funds rate again drifted below the
Federal Reserve's target rate of 8 1/4%. The funds rate,
which banks charge each other on overnight loans, is closely
watched by analysts because the Fed often uses it to signal
changes in credit policy. But the rate sometimes moves for
technical reasons.</p>
<p>In recent days, the rate has fallen under 8% because of
technical factors related to commercial banking matters. The
rate was 8 1/8% for most of yesterday.</p>
<p>Typically, such weakness in the rate would prompt the Fed
to drain reserves from the banking system in an effort to
push the rate up to its target level.</p>
<p>Some economists said the Fed didn't push the rate higher
because it didn't want to raise speculation that it is in the
process of tightening monetary policy. Others, however, said
the funds rate is expected to rise above the target level in
the next day or two as tax-related payments flow out of the
banking system. Therefore, they said, the Fed doesn't want to
drain reserves it will soon need to replace.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury notes and bonds ended as much as 1/2 point
higher. The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 95
1/32 to yield 8.97%, compared with a price of 94 19/32 to
yield 9.01% on Wednesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at
96 21/32 to yield 9%, compared with 96 10/32 to yield 9.05%
on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Short-term rates eased slightly. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.86% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8.11%, while the rate on six-month
bills fell to 7.98% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.41%.</p>
<p>The government sold $10 billion of 52-week Treasury bills
at an average discount rate of 8.05%. That was much higher
than the average rate of 7.72% at the previous 52-week bill
auction April 5 and was the highest average rate at an
auction since 8.18% on June 1, 1989.</p>
<p>Here are auction details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                                       52-Week Bills

<p>The bills are dated May 10 and mature May 9, 1991.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Following several days of brisk trading, the junk bond
market was quiet.</p>
<p>The only exception was the bonds of PA Holdings Corp.,
which started to rise Wednesday on news that Henley Group
Inc. plans to spin off its two biggest units, Fisher
Scientific Group Inc. and Pneumo Abex Corp., in tax-free
distributions.</p>
<p>PA Holdings' 13 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 1999
gained five points to close at 75, while its 12 3/4% senior
extendible notes were bid five points higher at 95. The
securities represent bonds issued on behalf of Pneumo Abex.</p>
<p>Henley Group Chairman Michael Dingman said that before the
spinoff, Henley will take a number of steps to inject equity
and remove debt from the units.</p>
<p>Those steps to "de-leverage" the units, he said, would
make them viable companies and would boost the value of
Pneumo's junk bonds outstanding.</p>
<p>Traders said activity was muted, in part, because some
investors wound down operations for the week as they headed
to Morgan Stanley & Co.'s annual high-yield conference, which
began last night in Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Bolstered by another big day of derivative mortgage-backed
issuance, active mortgage issues gained 11/32 to 3/8 point
and matched the advance in the intermediate Treasury market.</p>
<p>There were $2 billion of real estate mortgage investment
conduits offered in five offerings, following the $2.2
billion announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The heavy Remic issuance reflects continued investor
demand for mortgage securities, which carry relatively high
yields and top credit ratings.</p>
<p>Dealers noted that there recently has been a very light
supply of corporate bonds, a traditional alternative to
mortgage securities for many institutional investors.</p>
<p>The lack of corporates has meant that institutions with
money to invest have had little choice but to buy Treasurys
or mortgage securities. Because mortgage securities yield on
average about one percentage point more than Treasurys,
mortgages have been the focus of strong demand.</p>
<p>Traders said the demand for derivative mortgage securities
doesn't appear to be diminished by rumors that the office of
the Comptroller of the Currency soon will issue regulations
clamping down on bank purchases of risky derivative mortgage
issues.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
May delivery ended at 93 3/4, up 3/8, and Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2% securities were at 96 9/32, up 11/32.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 10.06% to a 12-year
average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury
10year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.06.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were up as much as 1/2 point, amid stifled
trading activity.</p>
<p>"It's torture sitting here doing nothing," one New York
trader said, adding that trading was sparse and few
bid-wanted lists were visible in the market.</p>
<p>In negotiated dealings, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
group priced $67.3 million of Ohio Water Development
Authority Series A and Ohio Air Quality Development Authority
Series B State of Ohio collateralized pollution control
revenue refunding bonds on behalf of the Toledo Edison Co.
Project.</p>
<p>Also in the negotiated sector, the pricing of $158 million
of District of Columbia general obligation bonds has been
rescheduled to next week, said an official with lead
underwriter R.W. Corby & Co.</p>
<p>No large competitive issues were priced.</p>
<p>Among active bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue of 2018 was up 1/4 at 95 1/4 bid to yield 7.60%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch & Co. launched the first mark-denominated
zero-coupon bond the West German market has seen in 2 1/2
years. Merrill offered 100 million marks ($59.4 million) of
10-year securities that were priced at 43 3/4 to yield 9.26%.
The securities are non-callable.</p>
<p>Rival syndicate houses said the issue was "too tightly
priced," meaning the yield was low relative to government and
quasi-government bonds that are used as market benchmarks.
One trader, for example, noted that a top-quality World Bank
issue yields 9.08%, only 0.18 percentage point less than the
Merrill issue.</p>
<p>An investment manager said the Merrill Lynch issue is
unattractive at a time when investors still fear higher
interest rates, but Merrill officials said the issue was
prompted by demand from West German retail customers.</p>
<p>Zero-coupon bonds pay no interest but are issued at a deep
discount. Investors' gains come from the difference between
the discounted purchase price and the face value received at
maturity.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, West German government bonds rallied
on news that the Bundesbank would leave interest rates
unchanged for the time being.</p>
<p>But many analysts remain bearish about the market's
long-term prospects. And many economists believe that the
Bundesbank will eventually tighten monetary policy, possibly
in July.</p>
<p>Bonn's 7 3/4% bond due 2000 rose 0.30 point to 93.25 to
yield 8.80%, while the 8% notes due in 1995 were up 0.13
point to 95.85 to yield 9.09%.</p>
<p>In Britain, bond prices jumped as technical analysts told
customers the market was ready to rally.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose
one point to 95 18/32 to yield 12.37%, while the 12% notes
due in 1995 rose 1/2 point to 95 5/32 to yield 13.38%.</p>
<p>Japanese financial markets were closed yesterday in
observance of Constitution Memorial Day, and they will remain
closed today for Children's Day.</p>
