	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The impressive performance of Tambrands stock
-- it hit an all-time high of 82 1/2 yesterday and is up 18%
this year -- has some Wall Streeters scratching their heads.
They can't figure out how Tambrands has managed it,
especially in a punk market environment with the average
stock down about 6%.
   To be sure, lots of good things are happening at
Tambrands. Earnings, which faltered in 1989, are bouncing
back. The consensus (according to Zacks Investment Research)
calls for profit of $4.65 a share this year and $5.64 in
1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And the new managers who took the helm last year, led by
chief executive officer Martin Emmett, are much more
shareholder-oriented than previous management. They have sold
off Tambrands's two money-losing divisions, Physicians
Formula (cosmetics) and Hygeia Sciences (First Response
pregnancy-detection kits). They have jettisoned the corporate
jet. Most important, they have had Tambrands actively buy
back stock.</p>
<p>But despite all of this good news, many analysts and money
managers are puzzled why the stock has gotten so high. After
all, Tambrands basically is a one-product company (Tampax
brand tampons), and the U.S. market for tampons isn't growing
significantly.</p>
<p>Thus, Tambrands's profit surge comes mainly from
aggressive cost-cutting (including sharp reductions in the
number of employees) and stock buy-backs. Most analysts
praise those steps, but it's not as if such measures can
continue forever.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stock has climbed to 23 times the past 12
months' earnings, and about 18 times what analysts figure it
will earn this year. It sells for 15 times cash flow
(earnings plus depreciation). By contrast, says Smith Barney
analyst Joseph Kozloff, Procter & Gamble and Gillette, two
other highly regarded consumer products companies, sell for
10 times cash flow. The stock also trades at roughly three
times sales and seven times book value (assets minus
liabilities), both unusually high ratios.</p>
<p>"It's a fine company with a dynamite franchise," says Mr.
Kozloff. "But, geez, the stock's expensive." He rates it a
hold.</p>
<p>Brenda Landry, analyst with Morgan Stanley, rates
Tambrands a buy. But after the recent price surge, she is
beginning to see the upside as limited. "If everything goes
well they will make $5.50 to $6 next year," she says. "You
have a $90 to $100 stock."</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch's Deepak Raj and Goldman Sachs' Jack Salzman
are also Tambrands boosters. Mr. Salzman is especially
impressed with Tambrands's free cash flow, which he pegs at
$60 million a year.</p>
<p>Heavy buying by three Fidelity mutual funds has also
pushed up the stock. Fidelity analyst Arieh Coll compares
Tambrands to Walt Disney in the mid-1980s -- a great consumer
franchise that had temporarily lost its spark. New management
is "revitalizing it and running {it} the way it should be
run."</p>
<p>But money managers who have sold the stock recently say
that all good things come to a price limit. Kenneth Hackel,
president of Cash Flow Investors, sold his Tambrands holding
about a month ago. Mr. Hackel almost never owns a stock that
sells for more than 20 times free cash flow. When Tambrands
crossed that threshold, he sold. (The multiple now is 22, he
says.) Mr. Hackel says he'll occasionally make an exception
to his sell rule if a stock's free cash flow is rising
unusually fast. But Tambrands's free cash flow is "growing
very, very slowly," about 3.8% a year, he says.</p>
<p>Tambrands has figured from time to time in takeover talk,
but few analysts or money managers seem to take the rumors
seriously. Tambrands won't comment on this.</p>
<p>Paul Konney, Tambrands's corporate secretary and
spokesman, says the stock's strength shows that investors are
pleased Tambrands "has adopted this new mission of focusing
on our core business." Although unit growth in the U.S.
sanitary protection market is only about 1% a year, Mr.
Konney says, "We think that the core business has substantial
growth potential."</p>
<p>Over the five years 1990-1994, Tambrands thinks it can
increase its share of the tampon market to 65% from 60%. It
figures Tampons can grow 0.5% a year at the expense of
sanitary pads. And the company expects price increases will
add another 4% a year or so. Foreign growth is faster but
harder to quantify. Tambrands hopes to increase its foreign
sales (recently 39%) as a percentage of total sales.</p>
<p>Tambrands won't project earnings. But the foregoing
figures suggest the company expects U.S. earnings (aside from
cost-cutting and stock buy-backs) to grow at about a 7% clip.
Foreign growth might raise the total to 10% or so. That could
look nice in the kind of sputtering economy many investors
expect. But it's not the kind of growth for which investors
usually pay the premium price that Tambrands commands.</p>
