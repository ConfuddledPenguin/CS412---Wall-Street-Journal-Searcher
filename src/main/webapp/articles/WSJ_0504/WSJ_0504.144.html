	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The sharp plunge in Japanese share prices this
year has forced stock dealer Akebono Kikaku Co. into
bankruptcy, a credit research agency reported.
   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. said Tokyo-based Akebono has
accumulated debt exceeding 210 billion yen ($1.33 billion)
and had allegedly issued bad notes twice since March 28. But
it is also possible that the $1.33 billion represented debts
by Akebono and several other companies controlled by two
major stock market speculators, Komei Tai and Seikichi Endo.
Whatever the source, it is the third-largest bankruptcy case
on record in Japan, the agency said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite a partial recovery in recent trading sessions,
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are more than 20%
below what they were at the start of the year. Teikoku Data
Bank said Akebono had been unable to meet margin calls
because of the steep fall in stock prices.</p>
<p>Akebono, founded in 1979, dealt in speculative trading in
about 20 stock issues, including those of chemical,
electric-power and pharmaceutical companies, according to the
Kyodo News Service. The company also managed hotels in the
downtown Tokyo district of Shinjuku.</p>
