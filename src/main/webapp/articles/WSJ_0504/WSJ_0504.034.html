	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A broker who formerly worked at Merrill Lynch
& Co. and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. settled a
complaint alleging that he misappropriated $503,000 from
customers.
   Marc Stuart Weiner signed a consent decree in federal
court in Manhattan, admitting that he had defrauded some
customers, as alleged in a Securities and Exchange Commission
complaint filed in September. Mr. Weiner also consented to an
order directing him to repay $387,000, the amount of money
that he has yet to return. However, Mr. Weiner said in an
affidavit that he is currently financially unable to pay that
amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Joel Rudin, Mr. Weiner's attorney, said the acts occurred
during 1986 and 1987 because Mr. Weiner was a "compulsive
gambler and had hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to
various bookies." Mr. Rudin said that for more than a year,
Mr. Weiner has attended sessions of Gambler's Anonymous.</p>
<p>The SEC said Mr. Weiner is awaiting sentencing in a
criminal case in federal court in Brooklyn. In December, he
pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud arising from
some of the acts alleged in the SEC complaint.</p>
