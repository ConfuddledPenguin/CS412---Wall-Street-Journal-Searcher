	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is launching a marketing
blitz aimed at regaining the good will of millions of
American consumers turned off by its lackluster cars and cold
customer relations during the 1980s.
   The campaign will involve not only newspaper and
television advertising, but an effort to encourage GM's 1.2
million salaried and blue-collar workers, retirees and dealer
sales personnel to talk up the company and its products. And
these workers and retirees will even be urged to serve -- on
a voluntary basis -- as semi-salesmen, referring customers to
local dealers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Behind the campaign, estimated to cost more than $40
million, is a realization by GM executives that a large
number of American consumers are fed up with domestic cars in
general, and GM cars in particular.</p>
<p>One report circulating inside GM shows that among owners
of domestic cars who have had eight or more problems with
their vehicle in a year, only 40% would buy the same brand
again. By contrast, the survey, by California market research
firm J.D. Power & Associates, found that 66% of the owners of
Japanese and other Asian cars encountering the same level of
trouble would nonetheless buy the same brand again.</p>
<p>GM executives have been remarkably candid of late in
acknowledging they sold a lot of trouble-plagued cars during
the 1980s, including the Chevrolet Citation and Pontiac
Fiero. Persuading consumers to come back to GM will be "a
hard sell," says Chairman-elect Robert C. Stempel.</p>
<p>Now, the hard sell is beginning.</p>
<p>GM is launching the advertising side of its attack with
four-page newspaper advertisements in USA Today, the New York
Times, the Los Angeles Times and papers in 20 cities where GM
has factories.</p>
<p>The ads feature pictures of employees under the headline:
"You told us you'd consider buying a new GM car or truck if
we changed more than just the looks." The rest of the pages
detail GM's case that its vehicles now are much more reliable
and better designed than those the company sold during the
mid-1980s.</p>
<p>In television ads, which also begin running today, GM
employees will be shown vouching for the quality of the
products they build. "All American cars are better than
people think," says tool maker John Balogh, according to a
script of the spot. Adds designer Jerry Palmer: "GM cars have
a whole new standard of dependability and trouble-free
performance." The tag line will be: "Putting quality on the
road." Later this month, more television spots will link this
theme to GM's individual car divisions, a GM spokesman said.</p>
<p>In many ways, GM's new ads echo Ford Motor Co.'s
long-running "Quality is Job One" campaign, which also uses
Ford workers to tout the car maker's commitment to quality
products. The campaign also has certain parallels with recent
Chrysler Corp. ads that feature Chairman Lee Iacocca.</p>
<p>But GM's campaign is far more specific than its
competitors' efforts. For one thing, GM's ads are remarkable
in their acknowledgment that, as the company spokesman said,
"we've still got a way to go" to surpass Japanese quality
levels.</p>
<p>GM print ads include a chart showing that GM's defects per
100 cars have dropped from just under 800 in 1980 to about
200 in 1989. But the same chart shows that Japanese auto
makers still lead in this basic measure of quality.</p>
<p>GM has been working on this overhaul of its corporate
marketing effort for months, using the New York offices of
McCann-Erickson Worldwide and its traditional corporate
advertising agency, Ayer Inc., to develop the campaign.</p>
<p>The effort initially caused friction inside the company,
as some divisional marketing officials expressed reservations
about the ads featuring their products. One early draft of a
Chevrolet ad, for example, showed a line of cars starting up
in cold weather. "It looked like a battery commercial,"
complained one Chevy employee.</p>
<p>Other GM officials worried that it was risky to say that
the company sold products in the recent past that weren't
that good. They were also concerned about raising the quality
issue at a time when most independent surveys and even GM's
own studies show many of the company's cars don't measure up
to the standards set by the best Japanese manufacturers.</p>
<p>All this apparently delayed some parts of the campaign.
Expectations were that the ads would begin running in
mid-April. Now, the divisional ads won't air until later this
month. The campaign "has been updated and changed and honed
to be as good as it can be," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, GM has also begun an effort to mobilize
its army of workers and retirees to get out and talk up their
employer and its products.</p>
<p>GM has made videotapes featuring pep talks from Mr.
Stempel; Stephen P. Yokich, head of the United Auto Workers
union's GM department; and leaders of other unions. Over the
past few days, the No. 1 auto maker has distributed the
videotapes to its 9,700 U.S. dealerships and to all its U.S.
plants. GM also has sent special editions of in-house
newspapers to the dealerships, which employ about 365,000
people, to some 330,000 retirees, and to about 500,000 active
U.S. workers.</p>
<p>"People who own GM cars and trucks like them, and are much
happier than the average buyer in the new car market thinks
they are," Mr. Stempel says in the tape. Adds Mr. Yokich: "We
have to make sure the American public gets a quality
product."</p>
<p>GM's goal is to get the 1.2 million members of the "GM
family" to "update themselves on GM's quality and ask them to
go forth and spread the word," the company spokesman said.</p>
<p>This internal marketing push comes in addition to several
other efforts to regain customer trust and win back some of
the market share GM has lost. Through the first four months
of 1990, GM's share of all U.S. car and truck sales moved up
to an estimated 35.8% from 35.1% a year ago, but that's still
well below the mid-40% share GM had in the 1980s.</p>
<p>One effort to boost sales is a new program to enlist GM
employees as volunteer sales representatives, referring
potential buyers to GM dealers. GM says employees helped sell
some 10,000 cars last year. (In total, the auto maker sold
5.1 million vehicles in the U.S. last year.)</p>
<p>Employees don't get paid for selling cars. Instead, they
get what GM calls "an expression of appreciation," such as
company jackets or pen-and-pencil sets.</p>
<p>Separately, GM is trying a program that allows dealers to
fix some defects for free, even if the warranty has expired.</p>
<p>Under a pilot program called "GM Cares," launched last
November in Cincinnati, about 42 GM dealers can offer a
disgruntled patron not only a free repair, but free use of
another car until the work is done -- a benefit that isn't
called for in the standard GM warranty. Other car makers
already have similar programs, but GM's pilot is said to be
the most aggressive in the industry, dealers say.</p>
<p>GM officials decline to discuss the Cincinnati program but
the company signaled in its annual report that the program
"will be expanded to other locations."</p>
<p>Dealers can't wait. GM spends "hundreds of millions of
dollars in advertising to try to capture market share," says
John Sieve, a Cincinnati Pontiac dealer. "And then they lose
{customers} over relatively small repair issues."</p>
