	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats unveiled a campaign-finance
proposal that would take most of the special-interest money
out of politics and replace it with public funds.
   "We have to slow down the money chase," said Sen. David
Boren (D., Okla.), an architect of the plan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Democratic plan would require Senate candidates to
adhere to spending limits, based on the voting-age population
of their state. In return, they would receive a
taxpayer-financed subsidy to run their campaigns, as well as
reduced mail and broadcast costs.</p>
<p>The Democratic plan would also prohibit contributions to
U.S. Senate candidates by political action committees. This
proposal follows the lead of Republican senators, who earlier
this week submitted a campaign-finance plan that would
abolish PACs altogether.</p>
<p>It was unclear yesterday how many Democrats had actually
signed onto the plan for public funds, which will be
vigorously opposed by Republicans. Majority Leader George
Mitchell said he expected a "substantial majority" of
Democrats to embrace it.</p>
<p>The plan would cost at least $120 million per election
cycle, according to estimates by Democratic Senate aides. The
funds would come from a voluntary taxpayer checkoff similar
to the system used for financing the presidential election.
The checkoff probably would be increased to $3 per individual
from $1 to cover the cost of congressional campaigns.</p>
<p>But Republican critics immediately contended that the plan
would be far more costly. If House races were added, Sen.
Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who led a filibuster against
campaign-finance legislation two years ago, predicted the
Democratic plan would cost $400 million. "They surely must
know this isn't going anywhere," Sen. McConnell said
yesterday.</p>
<p>"Their plan sounds more like a campaign rip-off than
campaign reform," said Republican Sen. Pete Wilson of
California.</p>
<p>Many Republicans also oppose spending caps because most
incumbents are Democrats, and challengers usually need to
raise more money to win an election.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the public funds under the Democratic
proposal, Senate candidates would have to raise a threshold
level of private funds (10% of the general election spending
limit in their state, at least half of which must come from
in-state individuals in amounts of $250 or less). Candidates
also would be permitted to exceed the spending limits by 25%
with small contributions ($100 or less) raised within the
state.</p>
<p>In an effort to woo moderate Republicans, the Democratic
plan embraces broadcast provisions endorsed by Sen. John
Danforth (R., Mo.). Candidates would receive vouchers for
prime-time television advertisements of one to five minutes
during the eight weeks leading up to a general election. They
also would be required to appear on camera at the end of
their ads to take responsibility for the content. These
proposals would curb negative, "hit-and-run" campaign ads,
Sen. Boren said.</p>
<p>The Democrats also proposed clamping down on large
contributions made by wealthy individuals to state political
parties, known as soft money, which isn't restricted by
federal laws.</p>
<p>Several public-interest groups, including Common Cause and
Public Citizen, praised the Democratic plan.</p>
<p>But almost everyone predicts difficult negotiations ahead.
"This can lead to a new system that fundamentally changes the
way business is conducted in Washington," said Common Cause's
Fred Wertheimer, "or it can lead to stalemate and status quo,
a disastrous result for the country."</p>
