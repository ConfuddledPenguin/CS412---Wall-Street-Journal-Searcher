	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines said it flew 1.58 billion
revenue passenger miles in April, a better than tenfold
increase over its year-ago traffic.
   Eastern, a unit of Houston-based Texas Air, said the
results of this year's numbers aren't comparable to last year
because in 1989 the airline was still reeling from a March
strike that nearly grounded the carrier. In the year-ago
period, Eastern said it flew 153 million revenue passenger
miles. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown
one mile.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This year's load factor, or percentage of seats filled,
was 63.9%, compared with last year's 42.25%.</p>
<p>For the first four months of 1990, Eastern flew 6.34
billion revenue passenger miles, compared with 4.51 billion
in the year-earlier period. Load factor for the year to date
was 63.4%; in 1989, it was 54.5%.</p>
