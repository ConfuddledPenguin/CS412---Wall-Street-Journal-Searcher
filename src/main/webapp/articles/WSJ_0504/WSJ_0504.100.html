glass group Solaglas Ltd. for #96.5 million ($158.5 million)
from its South African parent PGSI.
   The French glass and building materials group said the
agreement also calls for it to sell its European automotive
glass repair businesses to PGSI's Autoglass group unit for
#16 million.</p>

fiscal year ended March 31, mainly from its operations in
flat glass processing, glazing, tempered glass, laminated
glass, mirrors and double glazing.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain's auto glass repair businesses, based in
France and Germany, had 1989 revenue equivalent to #17
million.</p>
