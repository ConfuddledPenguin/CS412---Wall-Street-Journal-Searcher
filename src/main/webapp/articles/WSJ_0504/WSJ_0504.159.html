	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, trying to
ease fears among other European Community members, said
Thursday that all EC countries should have the same
opportunities as West Germany in developing the East German
market.
   Mr. Haussmann said Bonn is advising the East German
government to provide tax incentives not only to West German
companies wanting to do business there, but also to all
interested companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He pointed out that the planned German monetary and
economic union will open up great opportunities for foreign
industry. "From July onwards, every company that's active in
West Germany can also become active in East Germany," he
said.</p>
<p>The freedom of competition in East Germany was a source of
concern expressed by some EC leaders at their Dublin summit
meeting Saturday.</p>
<p>Mr. Haussmann said he had reached agreement with EC
officials that in the current first phase of German
unification, the EC wouldn't have any powers to veto or limit
aspects of continuing negotiations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Regarding reconstruction of the East German economy, Mr.
Haussmann stressed the need to speed up plans to
denationalize the country's state-owned industries, but he
admitted that many details remain to be worked out. He said
privatization is essential to cope with a large number of
unemployed expected to result from the planned July 1
introduction of the Deutsche mark in East Germany.</p>
<p>One problem in a large-scale privatization is the
impossibility to set an attractive price for key industrial
properties, because asset value is extremely limited. "And of
course, the earnings value of many big companies is small,"
said State Secretary Dieter von Wuerzen.</p>
