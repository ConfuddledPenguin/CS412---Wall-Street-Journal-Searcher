	<p class="article-leader">NEW DELHI -- The U.S. yesterday criticized Asian countries
that it said are not going far enough toward opening their
economies to the rest of the world, singling out Taiwan,
South Korea and Thailand.
   In a speech to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) annual
meeting here, U.S. Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary George
Folsom indicated that Taiwan should let its currency
appreciate further. He said "exchange rate policy adjustment"
should play an important role in the nation's economic
policy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While saying some Asian countries had progressed in recent
years, Mr. Folsom questioned whether continued rapid growth
is sustainable without further liberalization.</p>
<p>"In many Asian countries, governments continue to
intervene in all aspects of their countries' economies,
maintaining import substitution policies, disincentives to
foreign investment, bloated public enterprises, private
monopolies and overvalued exchange rates, all of which have
contributed to growth rates that are below those countries'
potential to achieve and perpetuate balance of payment
difficulties," Mr. Folsom told the 2,000 delegates,
government officials and bankers gathered for the ADB's 23rd
annual meeting here.</p>
<p>While Taiwan has pursued a liberalization of its foreign
exchange rate system, he said the adjustment process "must
continue." He said the country must also further liberalize
its foreign exchange rate and capital control rules.</p>
<p>On the subject of South Korea, he said the new exchange
rate system put in place in March is potentially important.
But he said its significance will depend on further
liberalization of foreign exchange and capital controls, as
well as further trade and financial market controls.</p>
<p>As for Thailand, he said the booming Southeast Asian
country should promote further industrialization and rural
development.</p>
<p>Mr. Folsom strongly voiced opposition to opening talks on
replenishing the ADB's soft loan window. He reiterated the
U.S.'s position that even though the current funding period
is set to expire this year, sufficient resources are in place
to postpone talks for at least 18 months.</p>
