	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Household International Inc. reported
first-quarter net income slipped 5%. But profit from
continuing operations rose 18% despite a doubling of the
finance concern's provision for loan losses.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. has said it is reviewing
Household's debt ratings for possible downgrade, citing rapid
loan growth, among other things. But Donald C. Clark,
chairman and chief executive officer of Household, told a
meeting of securities analysts here that he has no plans to
slow the pace of growth. Mr. Clark said he expects 1990
profit to surpass the record, reached in 1988, of $246.7
million, or $6.80 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income for the Prospect Heights, Ill., company's first
quarter fell to $52.2 million, or $1.36 a share, from $55.2
million, or $1.51 a share. The year-ago results include
profit from discontinued operations of $11 million.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the latest quarter was
$93 million, more than twice the $44.3 million set aside last
year. The increase was to cover higher charge-offs and to
increase the reserve for future losses because of rapid loan
growth.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Household stock closed unchanged at $42.50 a share. The
shares have fallen sharply since last month, when Moody's
said it was reviewing Household's credit ratings.</p>
<p>Problem commercial real estate assets, which include
nonperforming loans and property foreclosed on or otherwise
taken to satisfy debt, jumped about 16% during the quarter to
$268.9 million. Mr. Clark said that figure may grow further
during the year but that by year end it would be back down to
the 1989 level of $231 million.</p>
<p>One area that concerns Moody's is Househhold's commercial
real estate loan portfolio, which totaled $760.8 million at
March 31. Another area of concern is so-called highly
leveraged transaction loans, used to finance leveraged
buy-outs, which stood at $1.1 billion. Mr. Clark said none of
those were nonperforming.</p>
<p>Household's biggest and most profitable business, consumer
lending, continued to grow rapidly during the quarter, with
loans rising to $17.2 billion from $16.1 billion at year end.
That includes first and second mortgages, unsecured personal
loans and credit card loans. Profit rose only 9% in the
business, however, because of losses at Household's British
and Australian operations.</p>
