	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prime Motor Inns Inc., as expected, reported
that fiscal third-quarter profit plunged 98%, citing "intense
competition in the hotel industry."
   And Chairman Peter E. Simon said he expects Prime's
results to be "under pressure over the next several quarters"
-- a near-term outlook shared by "virtually every other"
hotel company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the quarter ended March 31, Prime reported net income
of $209,000, or one cent a share, down from $18.2 million, or
55 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue dropped
17% to $82.4 million from $99.9 million. Last month, the
company had estimated that per-share net dropped
substantially for the quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Simon also said that Prime completed the sale of
long-term notes receivable to an affiliate of Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co. and received $40 million from the sale of a hotel.
Total proceeds of these transactions plus two previous debt
financings are $110 million, $57 million of which went to pay
bank debt and the rest for general purposes.</p>
<p>Prime also said it will concentrate its resources on its
AmeriSuites all-suite properties and Wellesley Inn
limited-service hotels, operations where market demand has
been strong.</p>
<p>The company thus reported no fees from contracting work it
does on properties, known as development income, nor any
gains on sales of properties. In the year-earlier period,
development income and property-sale gains were $13.6 million
and $6 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Prime owns, operates or manages 139 hotels in the U.S.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Prime shares fell 12.5 cents to $7.875.</p>
