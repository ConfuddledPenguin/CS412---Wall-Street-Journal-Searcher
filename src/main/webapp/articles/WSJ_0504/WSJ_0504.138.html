	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Corporate profits in the U.S., Canada and
Britain will slide this year, while earnings growth will
continue in the other major economies, according to a global
survey of economists.
   The survey, compiled by Consensus Economics Inc.,
predicted that U.S. corporate profitability will slump by
3.3% this year, the U.K.'s by 0.6%, and Canada's by 7%. As
for other major industrial economies, the group predicted
that West Germany's corporate profitability would grow by 9%
this year, Italy's by 8.7%, and France's by 7.2%. Japanese
corporate profitability is expected to jump by 11.3%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's usually considered healthy when economies don't move
in lockstep. When economic cycles are syncopated, companies
in slowing economies can look to markets in still robust
countries to tide them over.</p>
<p>In 1991, according to Consensus Economics, profitability
will expand for all seven of the big industrial countries,
and at rates fairly close to one another. For 1992, the group
predicted that corporate profitability would increase most in
Britain, where it forecast a jump of 10.9%. Meanwhile Japan
would show an increase of only 6.4%.</p>
