	<p class="article-leader">Brilliantly researched and written, Ron Chernow's "The
House of Morgan" (Atlantic Monthly Press, $29.95) is to such
recent best sellers as "Predator's Ball" and "Liar's Poker"
what "War and Peace" is to a Judith Krantz novel. To a
potentially dry and certainly difficult subject -- the
influence of high finance on modern life -- Mr. Chernow
brings a lively style and the endurance of a trouper. He
compares his archival digging with "an explorer hacking his
way through a lost continent and uncovering majestic,
moss-covered ruins," and conveys the excitement of discovery
in every chapter of this 808-page herniator.
   The story of "the most formidable financial combine in
history" begins with its founding in London by an American,
George Peabody, in 1838 as a conduit to sell American state
bonds to wealthy Britons. Peabody had his hands full of
mistresses and bastards, and the partnership eventually was
taken over by Junius Morgan, a Boston banker, who quickly
turned it into a powerful rival of the Rothschilds. Junius
set up his son J. Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913) in New York
with Anthony Drexel of Philadelphia. This partnership grew
into J.P. Morgan & Co. and Drexel & Co. The London bank
became Morgan Grenfell and Morgan et Compagnie in Paris.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was a transatlantic axis that dominated world finance
for nearly a century. Then, in 1935, the Glass-Steagall Act,
specifically targeted to break up the Morgan empire, forced
J.P. Morgan & Co. to split off its investment banking
activities with the establishment of Morgan Stanley. In 1959
J.P. Morgan merged with Guaranty Trust. Mr. Chernow follows
each of these tributaries from its source until 1989.</p>
<p>He traces, for instance, how changing times affected
Morgan Grenfell, once the most aristocratic, powerful and
prestigious of London merchant banks, but by the 1970s, the
city's aggressive takeover specialist. Embroiled in the
Guinness scandal, it never recovered fully and was bought by
Deutsche Bank last year.</p>
<p>The truest heir to the old House of Morgan is Morgan
Guaranty Trust, not the least because of its ambience, which
Mr. Chernow describes as, "A universe away from the coarse
bustle of Chase Manhattan or Citibank, {which} seduces the
rich with leather armchairs, grandfather clocks and polished
brass lamps." It currently ranks fourth in size and first in
profitability among American banks.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley began its life with a ready made blue-chip
client list and has remained at the pinnacle of investment
banking for 55 years. Of the 10 top investment banks in 1979
only four made it to the '90s under the same ownership
control, Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber, Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, still the most profitable of all.</p>
<p>Throughout its history the House of Morgan was
unswervingly pro-British: "Nearly everybody I know has
started for shooting in Scotland," Morgan once truthfully
wrote to a partner in early August. New York partner Russell
Leffingwell said, "To my mind the only thing worth fighting
for is to save England and the British Empire. For that I
would shed every drop of blood in my own veins, and let many
millions of Americans shed theirs too."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the British government engaged the House
of Morgan in 1915 to be its agent for the purchase of war
supplies, for which it was paid a 1% commission. The House
also performed invaluable intelligence work for the British
government, both in the U.S. and abroad. All of this was
fodder for Morgan critics, creating an enduring image "that
the Morgans were stooges of the British crown and that their
money was drenched in blood."</p>
<p>Back in the U.S., J.P. himself often had to contend with
William Jennings Bryan ("the toad in the Morgan garden"), who
focused his entire career on running against Pierpont and the
gold standard. Echoing the big industrial policy debates of
today, Pierpont Morgan favored consolidation of really big
business in order to promote U.S. entry into world markets.
He abhorred the idea of a decentralized free market economy.</p>
<p>In his consolidation of industrial ownership -- as in the
forming of U.S. Steel -- Morgan was really building a form of
private socialism with centralized production and
distribution.</p>
<p>"Morgan liked his capitalism neat and tidy, and under
banker's control," writes Mr. Chernow. "Because the House of
Morgan preached socialism for the rich, it always had a
partial affinity for those who preached it for the poor."
This is the Rockefeller Republicanism that Goldwater ran
against. It was no coincidence that big business and big
banks led by the House of Morgan were unremitting foes of
Reaganomics and supply-side theory.</p>
<p>Mr. Chernow devotes interesting pages to the sociology and
origins of the Yankee bank-Jewish bank co-existence on Wall
Street that remains in much diluted form to the present day.
The so-called "whiteshoe" banks like Morgan had their origins
in the Yankee merchant class raising money primarily from
London. The Jewish banks -- Kuhn, Loeb, Lehman, Goldman
Sachs, Seligman, Oppenheimer -- had their origins in the
German-Jewish merchant class and raised the capital primarily
in Germany. As the 19th-century unfolded, the Yankee banks
dominated the railroads and smokestack industries, while the
Jewish banks dominated the retail and textile industries.</p>
<p>Punctuating the narrative are photographs showing pictures
of J.P. and son Jack, both bulbous-nosed and
walrus-mustached, and many of their fine possessions, from
the house on Madison Avenue that became the splendid Morgan
Library, to their many yachts, all named the Corsair (I,
II,III and IV -- Pierpont claimed to be descended from the
pirate Henry Morgan). As commodore of the New York Yacht
Club, J.P. Morgan gave the club its most famous quotation:
"Anyone who asks about the cost of maintaining a yacht
shouldn't buy one."</p>
