	<p class="article-leader">Tucson Electric Power Co., Tucson Ariz., said the
Industrial Development Authority of Pima County issued $20
million in tax-exempt bonds on behalf of the utility. The
variable-rate bonds, issued via Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, have an initial interest rate of 7%, and final
maturity is 2025.
   Proceeds initially were used to acquire a guaranteed
investment contract, which provides credit enhancement until
it is replaced by a letter of credit the utility is
negotiating. Tucson Electric said it expects to have a $350
million master credit agreement in place by the end of June.
After that, the bond proceeds will be used to pay
construction costs of distribution facilities.</p>
