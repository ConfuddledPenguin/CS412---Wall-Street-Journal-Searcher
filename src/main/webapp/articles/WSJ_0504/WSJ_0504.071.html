	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund reported
that world economic growth is slowing this year to an average
rate of 2.25% from 3% in 1989 and 4% in 1988, but it said "no
recession is in sight."
   "We don't see a broadly based downturn in industrial
countries," said Jacob Frenkel, the IMF's chief economist, at
a news conference called to discuss the fund's latest "World
Economic Outlook" report. Mr. Frenkel and other IMF
economists forecast that the real, or inflation-adjusted,
world economic growth rate will "rebound" next year to an
average of around 3%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The IMF noted that "inflation remains a major concern in
many industrial countries, despite the economic slowdown
stemming from the generalized tightening of monetary
conditions since 1988." It added that interest rates are
likely to remain relatively high, so long as monetary
restraint isn't supported by fiscal restraint, particularly
in countries such as the U.S. that have high budget deficits.</p>
<p>Assuming that exchange rates for major currencies remain
at about current levels, the IMF economists predicted that
the U.S. current-account international payments deficit,
which declined last year to just under $106 billion, will
widen to $113.4 billion in 1990 and to nearly $130 billion in
1991.</p>
<p>It said Japan's surplus will total about $57.4 billion
this year, little changed from last year's figure, but will
widen to $73.4 billion in 1991. West Germany's surplus, which
amounted to $52.8 billion last year, will increase this year
to $62.3 billion and grow further to $68.2 billion in 1991,
the IMF said.</p>
