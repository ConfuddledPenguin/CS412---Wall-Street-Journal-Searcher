	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The nation's health expenditures rose 10.4%,
to $539.9 billion in 1988, the Department of Health and Human
Services said.
   The double-digit rise in 1988, the latest year for which
the department has figures, followed increases of 7.2% in
1986 and 8.5% in 1987. The acceleration primarily reflects a
faster rise in the general rate of inflation, an HHS
economist said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1988, health care accounted for 11.1% of gross national
product, the nation's total output of goods and services, up
from 5.9% in 1965, when the nation enacted two new federal
health programs -- Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for
the poor.</p>
<p>"Health care expenditures have been growing faster than
the national economy for many years," HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan said in a statement. "This growth will strain the
ability of the American people to pay for quality health
care."</p>
