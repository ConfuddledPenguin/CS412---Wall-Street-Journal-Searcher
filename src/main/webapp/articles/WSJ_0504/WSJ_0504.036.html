	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Bayerische Motoren Werke AG,
returning to the aviation engine business after a 30-year
absence, and Rolls-Royce PLC announced plans to form a joint
venture that, among other things, will develop jet engines
for airframes of 75 seats or more.
   BMW set up the deal by first arranging to acquire the
small jet-engine unit of Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, the
West German engineering group that has been spinning off
secondary operations to focus on consolidating its core
business. Called KHD Luftfahrttechnik G.m.b.H., the unit had
1989 sales of 180 million marks ($106.7 million) and supplies
engine components for the multination Airbus commercial
airliner and Tornado jet-fighter programs. The company will
be folded into the BMW-Rolls-Royce venture, to be based at
KHD Luftfahrttechnik's plant near here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BMW and Rolls-Royce said in a joint statement yesterday
that BMW will hold a 50.5% stake in the new venture with
Rolls-Royce retaining the remaining 49.5%. Financial
arrangements weren't disclosed. The joint venture will
collaborate with Rolls-Royce Tay and Trent engine programs.
In addition, it will serve as the vehicle to jointly design
and develop new engines with less than 20,000 pounds of
thrust for emerging lines of smaller airliners.</p>
<p>BMW officials say the engine venture is a base from which
to build a larger operation as the demand for short- and
medium-haul aircraft increases. The ongoing deregulation of
the European airline industry is allowing smaller airlines
with smaller airplanes to enter a marketplace where customers
increasingly prefer direct routings to smaller cities.</p>
<p>"Our estimation is that both partners will invest as much
as a billion marks in the venture over the next 10 years,"
said a BMW source.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, which has 50 licensing and cooperation
agreements world-wide, described the step as strengthening
its position in the European jet-engine market. Broader
link-ups between the two companies aren't planned. "BMW and
Rolls-Royce got together to run this company, that's it,"
said a Rolls-Royce spokesman.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, a major player in the market for jet engines,
receives a cash-rich partner after BMW enjoyed years of
strong profit growth on sales of its popular luxury cars.</p>
<p>Analysts put BMW's net cash position, or liquid assets
after accounting for debt, at 2.2 billion marks. BMW's jet
engine venture surprised many analysts. Indeed, BMW Chairman
Eberhard von Kuenheim has often asserted that BMW didn't feel
compelled to diversify because of strategies of other auto
makers, an apparent gibe at arch-rival Daimler-Benz AG and
its problems with achieving the desired synergy among its
varied operations.</p>
<p>"We had wondered what it was going to do with all that
cash, but this comes unexpected," said Stephen Reitman, an
automobile analyst for UBS-Phillips & Drew. "But it raises
their profile and gives them a foot in the door in a
potentially high-growth market."</p>
<p>Separately, Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz said yesterday it
agreed to spin off its Deutz-Allis Corp. farm-machinery
subsidiary to the U.S. division's management and an
unidentified "financial group."</p>
<p>Financial details and the identity of the U.S. financial
group were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz acquired Deutz-Allis in 1985. The
farm-equipment maker had sales of $307 million last year.</p>
<p>The company operates a sales and service network through
700 dealers in the U.S. and Canada. It also makes
crop-harvesting combines at a complex in Independence, Mo.</p>
<p>Since 1987, Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz said, Deutz-Allis has
followed a strategy of operating in niches of the tractor
market to avoid the negative impact of the fiercely
competitive farm equipment industry.</p>
