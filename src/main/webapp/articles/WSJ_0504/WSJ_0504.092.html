	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Share prices ended a two-day technical rally
mostly lower as investors took to the sidelines, while U.K.
voters went to the polls nationwide to cast ballots in local
elections.
   Meanwhile, the Tokyo market was closed yesterday and will
be closed today for holidays.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index
finished down 2.7 points at 2134.9, below the intraday high
of 2145.2 reached within the first half-hour of official
trading and better than the minimum of 2130.2 around midday.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 share index fell 1.4 points to
1676.6. Volume was a thin 392.8 million shares, compared with
433 million Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 index contract closed at 2166, up 7.5 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market rebounded from its midday low
largely on strength in stock-index futures buying, which
underpinned the underlying FT-SE 100 equities. Additionally,
scattered buying in selected blue chips gave support, as did
a steady opening on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The upswing, however, wasn't sustained in the face of
potential market uncertainties presented by the local U.K.
elections, the largest nationwide vote since parliamentary
polling three years ago, traders said.</p>
<p>Political pundits viewed the election as a potential
mandate for the future of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party, even though the results only apply to
municipal councils rather than the central government
leadership.</p>
<p>Among corporate news, pharmaceutical concern Wellcome fell
11 pence to 665 pence (18 cents to $10.91) despite reporting
a 28% rise in pretax profit for the six months ended March 3,
results that were at the higher end of market forecasts.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was expecting a more bullish
statement from the company on its flagship drug, Retrovir,
used in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, oil stocks were mixed after news of a temporary
production accord by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.</p>
<p>British Petroleum added 4 1/2 pence to 412 1/2 pence;
Burmah dropped 4 pence to 560 pence after announcing that it
would change the ratio of its American depository receipts to
ordinary shares to 2-to-1 from 4-to-1; Enterprise was
unchanged at 583 pence after several days of strong gains;
Lasmo sank 7 pence to 362 pence; and Shell rose 1 1/2 pence
to 439 1/2 pence.</p>
<p>Among strong gainers, Britain's largest chemical concern,
Imperial Chemical Industries, gained 10 pence to #11.05;
Reuters rose 27 pence to #10.98 on heavy American buying;
Carlton Communications climbed 7 pence to 504 pence,
continuing the upward trend after taking a severe drubbing in
recent weeks; and Anglo-Dutch food maker Unilever jumped 9
pence to 634 pence after being "beaten up" recently, one
dealer said.</p>
<p>Decliners included tobacco and financial services
conglomerate B.A.T Industries, which fell 6 pence to 685
pence as market makers knocked down the share price amid a
surplus of stock, one trader said. Several other stocks were
affected by the same problem, this trader added: British
Aerospace dropped 9 pence to 512 pence and Associated British
Foods fell 7 pence to 378 pence.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered Bank lost 10 pence to 477 pence after
news about trouble at another U.K. retailer, one in which the
bank has reportedly extended #40 million in credit.</p>
<p>Pilkington, a major glass maker, shed 7 pence to 191 pence
after its U.K. distributor, Solaglas Ltd., was acquired by
France's Cie. de Saint-Gobain.</p>
<p>Electricals concern BICC dropped 10 pence to 396 pence on
an unconfirmed report of a brokerage firm's downgrading, one
trader said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan; and mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Singapore, Wellington
and Seoul; lower in Sydney, Taipei and Manila; and mixed in
Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
