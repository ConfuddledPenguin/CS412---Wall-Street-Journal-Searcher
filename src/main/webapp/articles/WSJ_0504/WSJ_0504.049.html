	<p class="article-leader">If you are ever in the position of having to eat your
words, a fad in India may make them go down a little easier.
   In one of the more astounding feats ever authenticated by
the Guinness Book of World Records, an Indian calligrapher
has crammed his country's national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana,"
onto a single grain of rice -- with husk to spare. What's
more amazing is that other samples of miniature writing on
rice continue to pour into the publisher's office in London,
and Guinness believes this week's record won't stand for
long.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We've got enough rice now to cook a curry," says Deputy
Editor Nicholas Brown, who confirmed the latest record for
"writing minuscule" with a magnifying glass. The composition
-- 515 letters in all -- includes the anthem in Hindi, a
saying by the poet Robert Frost and the full home address of
the calligrapher, Anantha Kumar.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown says that media reports about another Indian who
set the rice-writing record last year (with a mere 241
letters) have "set off a craze in India." That record didn't
stand long: It was doubled just as last year's book went to
press and there have been several new records since then.</p>
<p>Guinness requires writers to compose a meaningful passage
so they don't just repeat skinny letters, such as I's or L's,
through the text.</p>
<p>The champion of the moment, a 32-year-old from Bangalore
in southern India, is an old hand at micro-scribbling. As a
teenager, Mr. Kumar sketched flowers on dog's whiskers and
scenes from Indian mythology on mustard seeds. His epic rice
work is more notable for its length than its beauty.
According to Mr. Brown, it looks "like a fuzzy, dark speck"
to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Deft handwork seems to be the trend among the 12 new
record-holders announced by Guinness this week. A Frenchman
achieved 801 consecutive catches with a boomerang. And a man
from Missouri managed to hold nine baseballs in one hand.</p>
<p>Nor is rice the only canvas for would-be "writing
minuscule" entries. Mr. Brown says a Chinese man has
submitted a proverb written on a strand of hair that probably
surpasses the old record. "If China's anything like India,"
he says, "we'll be getting a lot of hair in the mail next
year."</p>
