	<p class="article-leader">MEXICO CITY -- On Sept. 1, 1982, President Jose Lopez
Portillo delivered a rambling, four-hour speech before the
Mexican Congress in which he announced the state's
confiscation of Mexico's private banks. Although he used the
term "nationalization," all the banks were already in the
hands of Mexican nationals.
   "We have broken the taboos," Mr. Lopez Portillo said. "The
revolution is freeing itself from fears and speeding up its
pace. . . . Mexico's private banking system has postponed the
nation's interest, and it has promoted, propitiated and even
instrumented speculation and capital flight.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It is now or never," he cried dramatically. "They have
already plundered us. . . . They will never plunder us
again."</p>
<p>President Lopez Portillo moved quickly to ensure that his
legacy would endure even after his administration. He changed
the constitution to prohibit the private ownership of banks.
Since a new president, Miguel de la Madrid, was getting ready
to take over, pressure was apparently applied to him so that
he would not turn back the clock. Just a few days before his
inauguration, and even though he was widely rumored to oppose
the banks' takeover, Mr. de la Madrid stated publicly that
the move was "irreversible."</p>
<p>Irreversibility lasted exactly seven years, eight months
and one day. On Wednesday, Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari broke a new taboo when he sent a bill to Congress
that, if passed, will once again allow private companies to
own and operate banks. In order to "better attend to the
state's basic responsibilities," the bill claimed, "greater
selectivity" must be exercised in the government's "ownership
of property."</p>
<p>Mr. Salinas wasn't expected to reprivatize the banking
system -- at least not now. The three months during which the
banks were managed by the Lopez Portillo administration, the
accounts were in total chaos. But under President de la
Madrid (1982-88) the banks' finances were cleaned up. Assets
and profits grew.</p>
<p>This was partially achieved, however, by having the banks
lend almost exclusively to a riskless client: the government.
In 1972 bank credit in the private sector amounted to 19.5%
of the gross domestic product. By 1988, the figure was down
to 7.2% of the GDP. Small companies and individuals -- like
myself -- were left without recourse to credit, even mortgage
loans.</p>
<p>Almost five years ago, I wrote a piece for this newspaper
in which I recounted the difficulties encountered by an
individual without high connections trying to buy a small
house. Obtaining a home mortgage without political
connections was quite impossible. This was at a time when
virtually all bank credit was being used to finance the
government's budget deficit.</p>
<p>I also wondered how a banking system that had been
transformed into little more than the administration's cash
register could possibly finance the major reconstruction that
was necessary after the 1985 earthquake. I ended up paying
for my home in cash, and many earthquake victims were
deprived of loans, as well.</p>
<p>To be sure, the inexorable power of supply and demand
often managed to gain the upper hand over private-banking
prohibitions, making it possible for consenting adults to
engage in credit practices. In 1987 I reported in this
newspaper on the evolution of a new informal financial
system. Stock-brokerage houses helped companies get loans.
Investment banks were also set up. But because they couldn't
legally be called banks, they chose fancy descriptions for
themselves, such as "financial engineering firms."</p>
<p>While Mr. de la Madrid kept his word and didn't revoke the
banks' formal attachment to the state, he did make it
possible for private investors to own up to 34% of a bank's
stock. Still, effective control remained firmly in the
government's hands.</p>
<p>For a while it seemed as if Mr. Salinas would follow a
similar path. Thus far in his still brief tenure as
president, he has liberalized the rules under which banks
operate. Now individual institutions can set their own
interest rates, operating schedules and distinctive services,
something they couldn't do before -- not even when they were
privately owned. Real competition among Mexican banks has
emerged for the first time in decades.</p>
<p>As a result of these actions, total bank deposits in
Mexico -- including money-market accounts and acceptances,
which previously were unavailable -- grew 40.7% in real terms
in 1989. Profits, which were 1.8% of total income in 1982,
rose to 5.6% by November 1989, the latest figure available.</p>
<p>But precisely because of the relative success of this
program, it was widely thought that Mr. Salinas wouldn't be
compelled to move on full privatization. Many of his economic
reforms, after all, were deeply resented by the country's
powerful intellectual elite, which, though changing,
continues to be dominated by those who favor socialist
policies. And many of the politicians who engineered and
supported the bank takeover are still around in key
government positions. This is why Octavio Paz, always a
dissident voice among Mexican writers, yesterday called
President Salinas's bill to Congress "a courageous and
intelligent rectification."</p>
<p>Without denying Mr. Salinas's personal determination and
courage, his decision must also be seen as a warning signal.
The banking "taboo" has been broken twice in less than eight
years, and in opposite directions. Only the development of a
truly mature political system, with appropriate checks and
balances among the various powers, will prevent a future
president from breaking the taboo again at will.</p>
<p>But at the very least, his action recognizes the most
insidious aspect of state ownership of the banks: With the
government controlling the banks, political considerations
often have played a role in banking decisions. A case in
point is Comermex, the fourth-largest bank in Mexico. The
bank had been in trouble for years until Guillermo Prieto
Fortun, a skilled financial administrator, was appointed
general director in 1989. A few months later, however, it was
thought politically advisable to remove the governor of the
state of Mexico, Mario Ramon Beteta, before elections were
held in that state. Mr. Beteta was appointed general director
of Comermex, while Mr. Prieto Fortun had to content himself
with the position of adviser to the finance secretary.</p>
<p>If Congress does agree to privatize the banking system,
such practices will be eliminated, and Mexico will change on
many different levels. Already the nascent "underground"
financial market has developed to the point where bankers who
participate in it are less afraid of calling themselves
bankers. And there is a young boy in my new house -- born
just three months before President Salinas took over as
president -- who I believe might grow up to live in a country
where he will be able to contract a mortgage loan if so he
chooses, or where he might decide to be a banker without
shame.</p>
