	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
use of the anti-AIDS drug zidovudine, or AZT, by children
three months to 12 years old.
   The drug, manufactured by Wellcome Foundation Ltd.'s
Burroughs Wellcome Co. unit of Research Triangle Park, N.C.,
has been marketed since 1987 to acquired immune deficiency
syndrome patients who are 13 and older. In addition, since
1989 Burroughs Wellcome has made AZT available to children
free of charge through an FDA program in which drugs for
life-threatening diseases are distributed on an experimental
basis. For younger children, the company produces a
strawberry-flavored syrup version of the drug. AZT normally
is marketed to adults in capsule form.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Free distribution of AZT for children will be phased out,
according to Kathy Bartlett, a company spokeswoman for
Burroughs Wellcome. She said the yearly wholesale cost of the
drug likely will average $1,750 a child, but "that will
certainly vary depending on the size of the child."</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan said the FDA's approval "should
encourage more insurance providers to reimburse for
zidovudine's use in pediatrics." The FDA will alter required
AZT labeling to recommend specific dosage for children.
Insurance companies sometimes refuse to reimburse for drugs
lacking FDA dosage recommendations.</p>
