	<p class="article-leader">Tomorrow, ministers from the four victorious Allies of
World War II meet in Bonn to discuss a unified Germany's
security policy. Though the clear wish of the German people
is to be a part of NATO, the Soviet Union seems ready to try
to thwart that goal. Instead, the Soviets want the equivalent
of continued four-power occupation. When you look at this
week's events in Red Square, with infuriated Soviet citizens
trying to break Moscow's grip, that sounds a bit disengaged
from reality.
   The three Western Allies, with some reservations, think
that the Germans are entitled to have their own country once
more. West Germany has earned that right with 45 years of
responsible democratic behavior. East Germans won it with
their courageous break with Moscow and vote to join the West.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the Soviets seem prepared to cling to the past,
treating Germany like a just-conquered vassal. After early
hints of reasonableness, they now call the German desire to
remain in NATO "absurd." Last month in the German weekly Der
Spiegel, Valenin Falin, Mr. Gorbachev's adviser on German
affairs, rumbled, "Either the GDR . . . fulfills its mandate
and the agreements and obligations that it entered into with
the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union, or the latent rights of the
Soviet Union will become an acute question."</p>
<p>That sort of old-fashioned Soviet bullying, familiar to
Lithuanians, suggests NATO is not obsolete. The Soviet
position rests on a denial of reality. As if the democratic
revolutions of the past year never happened, they insist that
the military demarcation of Europe should continue to run
down the middle of Germany.</p>
<p>The Soviets say they might remove their troops from East
Germany if the Allies remove theirs from West Germany. But
then Germany would be in limbo, unattached to the community
that West Germany helped build. Can the Russians really think
that would be a stable situation?</p>
<p>Some Westerners seem bent on matching the Soviet mind
games. NATO Minister Gianni de Michelis of Italy has praised
Czech President Vaclav Havel's idea of a single European
army, with the British RAF and the KGB under a single
command. German Chancellor Kohl has suggested a single
security structure that would stretch from Iceland to
Vladivostok. European diplomats talk about a NATO that would
shake off its military aspect and become a political
alliance, whatever that means. East German President Lothar
de Maiziere talks about a NATO that would be disarmed and
militarily eviscerated.</p>
<p>Before the 4+2 diplomats emerge and issue a communique
saying that the law of gravity has been repealed, it may be
worth returning to the fundamental realities.</p>
<p>Germany is a mature democratic nation, whose future should
not be determined by pie-in-the-sky diplomatic maneuverings.
The 4+2 structure, by revivifying World War II, has done
little more than add legitimacy to the presence of unwanted
Soviet troops on German soil. It has complicated German
unification and provided the Soviets with a forum in which to
claim sovereignty over Germany.</p>
<p>Negotioholics think that by reshaping negotiating
structures they are reshaping the world. But when diplomacy
doesn't reflect reality there is only trouble ahead.</p>
<p>The goal that NATO officials should set before them is to
speed Soviet withdrawal from Germany. And the voters of
Germany should tell their leaders that, with all the
rebuilding that has to be done in the East, they are not
willing to spend one billion Deutsche marks a year to support
an occupation army.</p>
