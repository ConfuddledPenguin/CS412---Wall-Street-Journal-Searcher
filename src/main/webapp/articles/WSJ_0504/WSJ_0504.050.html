	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
reported sharp drops in first-quarter profits, primarily
because of deep production cuts and weak sales in North
America.
   GM's first-quarter net income skidded 54% to $710 million,
or $1.02 a share, from a strong $1.55 billion, or $2.37 a
share, a year ago. A 22.5% drop in North American vehicle
shipments to dealers more than offset cost-cutting moves and
record results from overseas vehicle operations. The quarter
would have looked worse had it not been for a change in
pension-cost assumptions that added $75 million, or 12 cents
a share, to the bottom line.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GM
rose 37.5 cents to $45.125. GM earnings came in at the higher
end of analysts' predictions.</p>
<p>At Ford, profit plunged 69% to $506.2 million, or $1.10 a
share, from $1.64 billion, or $3.44 a share. In addition to
weakness in its home market, the No. 2 auto maker reported a
78% drop in overseas profit resulting from labor troubles in
Britain and economic turmoil in Brazil.</p>
<p>Sales incentives in the U.S. averaged about $1,000 a
vehicle at both companies during the first quarter.</p>
<p>Ford shares rose 12.5 cents to $45.625 in composite Big
Board trading.</p>
<p>GM and Ford officials said they're optimistic that the
strong medicine administered to cut North American
inventories during the January-to-March period will help
second-quarter results.</p>
<p>Ford Vice President and Treasurer David N. McCammon
predicted "no more down time" for any Ford plants through the
end of July. Despite the soft market, he is forecasting
second-quarter production will be down only 4% from a year
ago.</p>
<p>GM earned the bulk of its first-quarter profits from its
overseas vehicle operations, as well as its finance and other
nonautomotive businesses. The company refused to say whether
its core North American automotive operations were profitable
in the quarter.</p>
<p>GM added about 10% to its earnings for the quarter by
changing certain assumptions used to calculate pension
expenses. The company is now assuming that the average
retiree will die two years sooner than in the past. At the
same time, GM is betting that its pension fund managers will
get an 11% return on assets each year, up from the 10% a year
assumption used to calculate pension costs a year ago.</p>
<p>The company spokesman said GM pension fund managers have
averaged an 18% return on assets over the past five years --
an extraordinary period that saw both a bull market peak and
the October 1987 crash.</p>
<p>Ford also adopted a more optimistic pension fund outlook,
which added $26 million, or about 5%, to its first-quarter
profits.</p>
<p>The No. 1 auto maker also appeared to make real gains in
cutting costs. That effort was sharply escalated earlier this
year under a program labeled "Quick Start 1990," which
ordered GM's North American automotive units to defer capital
spending, freeze hiring and cut advertising budgets in an
effort to save $1 billion during this year.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, GM's operating costs exclusive of
depreciation and amortization, fell 8% from a year earlier.
But lower vehicle production more than offset those gains.
Revenue fell 9.4% to $30.1 billion from $33.2 billion a year
ago.</p>
<p>GM's reserve of cash and marketable securities dropped to
$5.5 billion from $6.4 billion a year earlier and $7.1
billion at the end of last year, in part reflecting the $600
million cost of acquiring a 50% interest in the automotive
operations of Sweden's Saab-Scania AB.</p>
<p>Ford's earnings came under attack from several fronts in
the first quarter. A sluggish U.S. car market forced the No.
2 car maker to cut its first-quarter production 26% from
year-ago levels and offer steep discounts to consumers. As a
result, Ford's U.S. automotive earnings skidded 80% to $160
million, down from $800 million in the first quarter of 1989.
That more than offset a 35% gain in earnings from Ford's
Financial Services Group, which posted profits of $191.2
million compared with $141.4 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford's overseas operations, which carried the
ball for the company last year when the U.S. market stumbled,
ran into trouble in the just-ended quarter. Ford's overseas
automotive earnings skidded to $155 million, down from $696
million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Strikes at Ford's European operations cost Ford about $200
million in earnings during the first quarter, Mr. McCammon
said. Ford may be able to recover some of those losses during
the remainder of the year, Mr. McCammon said. However, he
said, Ford's results in the second quarter will be hurt by a
just-resolved strike at an assembly plant in Genk, Belgium.</p>
<p>Ford also is having trouble in Brazil, where the
government's harsh anti-inflation measures have hobbled
operations at Autolatina, Ford's joint venture with
Volkswagen AG. Autolatina was the main reason Ford posted an
$85 million loss for its affiliated companies in the first
quarter, compared with a $60.3 million profit in the first
quarter of 1989, Mr. McCammon said. He warned that the
venture could suffer for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Mr. McCammon said there are some good signs for the second
quarter. The extensive plant idlings during the
January-to-March quarter helped Ford to trim its U.S. vehicle
stocks to 785,000 cars and trucks at the end of the first
quarter, nearly 200,000 less than the same period last year.</p>
<p>That should help Ford to push its sales incentive costs
back to an average of $1,000 per vehicle this month from the
$1,200 per vehicle level they hit during April, he said. That
is still well above the $400 per vehicle incentive costs Ford
had during the 1989 first quarter. But the auto maker is
introducing some new products, such as the Ford Explorer
sports utility vehicle, that may be popular enough to sell
without big discounts.</p>
<p>Mr. McCammon said Ford plans to run its U.S. factories
overtime to boost output to 110% of straight-time capacity
during the second quarter, compared with 91% during the first
quarter. Straight-time capacity is the level of production
achieved by running a plant for two, daily eight-hour shifts,
five days a week.</p>
<p>As of March 31, Ford had $3.9 billion in cash and
marketable securities, down from $8.1 billion a year ago. The
big drop reflected the lower profits, Ford's purchase of
Jaguar and heavy capital spending to bring out new cars.</p>
