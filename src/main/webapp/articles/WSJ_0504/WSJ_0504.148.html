	<p class="article-leader">From an article by editor Hendrik Hertzberg in the May 14
issue of the New Republic:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Congress invigorated by frequent infusions of new blood
would be a more responsive, more democratic, more varied
place. So would a Congress whose majority regularly changed
from one party to the other, which a term limit would
unquestionably promote. However bad this might be for the
short-term partisan interests of Democrats like me, it would
be good for the long-term interests of the country -- and the
party too. Critics of the term limit idea argue that it would
"weaken" Congress; and so it would, but in ways that would
strengthen both its most useful functions and democratic
governance in general.</p>
<p>The one-party Congress has become a world unto itself, and
the long period of Republican control of the presidency and
Democratic control of Congress has produced an insidious
mentality on Capitol Hill. The leaders of the Democratic
congressional majority, veterans of decades of supremacy in
their own little universe, no longer constitute an
opposition. They conceive of themselves as ins, not outs-as
leaders of one-half a permanent coalition government.</p>
<p>They may imagine that their own fiefdoms are secure, but
their party is reaping almost all of the penalties of
incumbency and almost none of the benefits. The foundations
of Democratic congressional dominance are being relentlessly
undermined, and once the structure topples, as eventually it
must, rebuilding it will seem as hopeless a task as
destroying it does now. A Congress shaped by a term limit
would have a different and healthier mentality. During
periods when it was controlled by the party that also
controls the White House, it would be energetic in pursuit of
that party's program; when in opposition, it would -- for a
change, and just as energetically -- oppose.</p>

<p>From an article in the May issue of Commentary by Charles
Horner, executive vice president of the Madison Center:</p>
<p>{O}f all the artificial divisions that exist in the world,
the one between Canadians and ourselves is the least natural,
the one least grounded in genuinely divisive forces. It is a
division which, so far as one can see, is of no practical
benefit to anyone anywhere, though it continues to provide
some people somewhere with emotional comfort.</p>
