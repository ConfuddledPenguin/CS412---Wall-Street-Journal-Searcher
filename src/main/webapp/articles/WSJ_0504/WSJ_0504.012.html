	<p class="article-leader">DANBURY, Conn. -- First Brands Corp. reported an 83%
decline in profit for its fiscal third quarter and warned
that earnings for its year ending June 30 could be lower than
expected.
   The manufacturer of such consumer brands as Glad, Prestone
and STP, cited difficulties in its antifreeze business.
Fiscal 1990 per-share profit "may be slightly lower than
expectations of $2.50," compared with the year-earlier $1.97,
when profit totaled $61 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit for the third quarter, ended March 31, fell to $2.7
million, or 12 cents a share, from $16.1 million, or 80 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 17% to $221.3 million
from $267.5 million.</p>
<p>Fiscal 1989 figures included $20.7 million in revenue from
the company's European businesses, which have since been
sold, the company said. Adjusting for the sale, quarterly
profit rose fivefold to $3.5 million, or 16 cents a share,
from $693,000 or three cents a share. Revenue fell 10% to
$221.3 million from $246.8 million.</p>
<p>First Brands said that lower-than-expected antifreeze
sales, primarily caused by price uncertainty, had reduced
overall sales below the prior year and plan. And because
there were added pressures to reduce antifreeze prices
further, it expected profit margins for the rest of the year
to be lower as well.</p>
<p>In addition to its problems with antifreeze, First Brands
also has been facing criticism over the environmental claims
the company has made about some of its products. It also has
had problems with one new-product introduction.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission and several state attorneys
general have been investigating claims by First Brands and
other plastic manufacturers that their products are
degradable and therefore better for the environment. The
inquiries have had no business impact and aren't expected to
have any such impact in the future, said Donald DeSantis,
vice president and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, First Brands recalled 200,000 cans of a
new car-wax product, after receiving three reports that cans
ruptured after being weakened from the inside by corrosion.
The product, Simoniz Quick Gloss, which retails for $4, is a
spray-on shine for use at auto shows and in showrooms. The
product accounts for a very small portion of sales and hasn't
affected revenue, Mr. DeSantis said.</p>
