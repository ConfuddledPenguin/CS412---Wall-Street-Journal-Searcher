	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. IS SCRAPPING plans to place new short-range
missiles in Europe.
   Citing recent political changes in Eastern Europe, Bush
announced that the U.S. was dropping plans for a modernized
version of the existing Lance missile because "there is less
need for nuclear systems of the shortest range." The missiles
were to be based in West Germany. The president, speaking at
the White House, also declared that the U.S. won't put new
nuclear artillery shells into Western Europe, and said the
administration is prepared to open talks with the Soviet
Union more quickly than previously planned on cutting
existing short-range nuclear missiles.</p>
