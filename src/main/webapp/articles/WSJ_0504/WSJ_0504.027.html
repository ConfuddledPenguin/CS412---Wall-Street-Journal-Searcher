	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- The skies Down Under are about to
open up. But by all appearances, deregulating Australia's
domestic air travel won't yield major changes soon.
   Airline deregulation is part of the Labor Party
government's strategy of making the country more efficient by
allowing more competition in various industries. Since the
government signaled its intention three years ago to shake up
the airline industry, Australians have been anticipating a
new age of air travel with new competitors offering better
service, more choices and lower fares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Nov. 1, the government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke will
scuttle regulations that for nearly 40 years have given a
stranglehold over domestic air travel to two carriers:
government-owned Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of
Australia. Ansett is a joint venture between Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. and TNT Ltd., an international transport company
controlled by Australian businessman Sir Peter Abeles.</p>
<p>But new competitors aren't exactly ready to challenge the
two carriers. The lack of enthusiasm has caused industry
watchers to argue that deregulation steps announced so far
haven't gone far enough.</p>
<p>To create the consumer benefits that deregulation can
cause, the Hawke government is "going to have to open the
gates a bit more" to, among others, foreign carriers, said
Richard Green, director of airline services at the accounting
firm Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu in Sydney.</p>
<p>Even government officials concede that it is unlikely that
any new airline will be flying on Nov. 1. "We view
(deregulation) as a process that will unfold, not necessarily
take off in full bloom on Day One," said a transport official
in Canberra.</p>
<p>What is likely to push the government toward further
deregulation is the badly needed potential tourism revenue.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, tourism overtook wool and
coal as the country's biggest foreign-exchange earner.</p>
<p>Four would-be airlines are being touted in industry
circles as serious contenders. Yet only one, Compass
Airlines, appears likely to be ready to fly before year end,
and even it plans to start small.</p>
<p>There are a variety of constraints confronting the
fledgling carriers, including a potential shortage of airport
terminal space in some cities, particularly Sydney, and
difficulties finding sufficient start-up funding, not to
mention enough of a financial cushion to ride out any fare
wars.</p>
<p>Moreover, the industry is full of wild cards, including
Canberra's future plans for Australian Airlines. Those could
include selling part or all of the domestic carrier, or
merging it with government-owned Qantas Airways, the
international flag carrier.</p>
<p>All this means that it is "even more difficult for any of
us to make a prediction about what will happen" under
deregulation, said Graeme McMahon, Ansett's general manager.
But he said Ansett intends to pull out all the stops to
protect its turf from upstarts.</p>
<p>It's also unclear whether Australia's sprawling land mass
and relatively tiny population of 16 million people will
allow for additional, economically viable domestic airlines.
Figures from the Department of Transport and Communications
show the domestic airline market has been growing at an
average annual rate of 2.7% in the past 10 years, to 14
million passengers in 1989. That trails the economy, which
has been growing at an average annual rate of more than 3%.</p>
<p>Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu noted, however, that the average
Australian currently travels less than once a year, compared
with the current post-deregulation average of two trips a
year for an American and 1.3 for a New Zealander. That
suggests there may be "a lot of pent-up demand" in Australia,
said Deloitte's Mr. Green.</p>
<p>Mr. Green and others predict that air travel in Australia
will undergo some immediate changes, including restructuring
service on some of the less-profitable routes. Ansett said it
doesn't intend to withdraw from any routes, but the number of
flights on some minor routes is likely to be cut. Moreover,
because fares on popular routes now subsidize costs on minor
routes, fares on minor routes probably will rise as the
established carriers cut fares to compete on major routes
where any new airlines are expected to concentrate. Industry
analysts say five routes on Australia's east coast account
for about 50% of the domestic airline market.</p>
<p>Government officials concede that air service on some
routes may suffer, but they argue that because several small
commuter airlines operate around the country, those carriers
can fill many gaps that may emerge as bigger carriers juggle
routes. Indeed, some analysts say the commuter airlines put
any new entrants on the airline scene at a potential
disadvantage. That is because many of the smaller carriers,
which feed passengers onto the major routes, already are tied
to Ansett or Australian Airlines through common shareholders
or other arrangements.</p>
<p>Compass Airlines may be ready to take off by December with
two out of a prospective fleet of five planes, Compass
officials say. They expect to have five planes operating in
the first quarter of 1991. With operating costs estimated at
less than two-thirds that of Ansett and Australian Air,
Compass figures it can afford to slash fares between 20% and
50%. Compass hopes to grab about 15% of the market.</p>
