	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision is
considering scaling back its extensive bureaucracy, including
possibly paring down its regional presence to mirror that of
banking regulators.
   The agency said that one of its highest priorities under
its new director, Timothy Ryan, will be cutting costs. The
office is examining, among other possibilities, trimming its
12 regional offices to five, in the same six cities where the
Comptroller of the Currency has offices. The comptroller
regulates federally chartered banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pending legislation would combine the thrift and banking
regulators; the moves proposed yesterday could be a prelude
to such a merger.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the thrift industry favors reducing its
regulatory costs. Banks and thrifts pay their regulators a
fee, based on their sizes, to cover the cost of examinations.
"The cost per institution, as opposed to the Comptroller's,
is extraordinarily high," said James Grohl of the U.S. League
of Savings Institutions. According to the trade group, the
S&L regulatory costs are more than double that of banks.</p>
<p>The trade group opposes combining the banking and thrift
regulatory apparatus, however.</p>
<p>The thrift office also proposed a regulation yesterday to
ban the sale of debt securities in S&L offices. The proposal
is primarily in reaction to sales of bonds issued by
Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. at its Lincoln
Savings & Loan Association subsidiary. Some holders of $200
million in now-worthless debt have testified before Congress
that they believed they were buying insured certificates of
deposit at Lincoln, in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p>The agency is seeking public comment on the proposals and
expects to have a decision by mid-June.</p>
