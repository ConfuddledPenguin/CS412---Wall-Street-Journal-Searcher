	<h3>Insider Trading Is Under Scrutiny In Hong Kong</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- An insider trader, as defined in a law
proposed by Hong Kong authorities, is someone who is
"connected with a corporation" and "knowingly in possession
of relevant information" while trading in that company's
stock.
   By most accounts, that definition would make an insider
trader out of a corporate director every time he buys or
sells stock in his company, regardless of whether he uses
insider information.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The janitor who vacuums the corporate boardroom also might
fit the bill, as might the investor who subscribes to stock
research not generally available to the public.</p>
<p>"The definition of insider is a problem," says Stephen
Cheong, a member of the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's
legislature. "It's so sweeping that, if abused, we could
become the laughing-stock of the financial world."</p>
<p>His voice is but one among a growing chorus of concern
over the draft legislation. Not that the legislation sounds
much fuzzier than existing law. And like existing law, it
stops short of calling the practice a crime.</p>
<p>But the draft bill does differ from current law in one
significant way. Whereas insider traders now face no
consequences other than embarrassment from official
disclosure of their misconduct, they would be subject to
fines and even banishment from corporate office under the
proposed ordinance.</p>
<p>With such a threat looming, Hong Kong's financial
community is combing through the proposal. And objections are
being raised not just by habitual critics of market
regulation. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange, no pushover when it
comes to policing the market, sees flaws in the proposal as
well. In the process, what started as an assault on trading
malpractices has turned into a forum on the dangers of
regulatory overkill. And it has put the government on the
defensive.</p>
<p>"I don't deny that there's a fashion out there for saying
that all is well and that there is no need for change," says
David Nendick, the government's secretary for monetary
affairs. "But I do not accept that there is too much
regulation. I would be failing in my duty if I sway with
public sentiment."</p>
<p>Public opinion, indeed, seems to have taken an abrupt
turn. The global stock crash of October 1987 drew wide
attention to pitfalls in Hong Kong's hands-off regulatory
approach. Insider trading, though not part of the problem on
that occasion, has since been targeted by the government as
one of many malpractices that require tougher policing. But
the entire reform exercise appears to be facing stiff public
resistance as memory of the crash fades.</p>
<p>The apparent vacillation underscores to some extent Hong
Kong's conflicting priorities. As regional rivalry for
investor attention grows, the colony is keen to move away
from its image as a financial center in which just about
anything goes. But given the territory's 1997 return to
China's rule, tough new laws inevitably invite concern that
they could be abused by future administrations. That makes
insider trading -- by consensus a widespread practice that
can't be tackled without tough new laws -- the focus of an
acute dilemma.</p>
<p>"It's a very difficult subject," says Derek Murphy,
formerly Hong Kong's deputy securities commissioner and
currently an executive with First Pacific Co., a diversified
investment concern. "And with 1997, it becomes even more
important to get the legal niceties right."</p>
<p>The burden for getting those niceties right falls for now
on Mr. Cheong, a businessman who heads the legislative
committee reviewing the draft. Given growing public concern,
he has asked the government to clarify several troublesome
clauses. As a result, the draft may not be cleared in time
for approval by the full legislature before it recesses in
July.</p>
