	<p class="article-leader">Proxy contests have entered the video age.
   New York investor Carl Icahn is tuning into USX Corp.
investors with television.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Icahn, who owns a 13.3% stake in USX, is waging a
proxy battle against the company to prod management into
splitting up the steel and energy operations. So far, the
contest has been fought through traditional ads and letters
to shareholders, but with Monday's shareholder meeting fast
approaching, Mr. Icahn has taken his fight to the airwaves.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Icahn bought a one-hour time slot on
Financial News Network's Institutional Research Network,
which says its subscribers include the nation's top 100
institutional investors, reached via satellite. The segment
opened with Mr. Icahn's partner, Alfred D. Kingsley,
announcing, "Welcome to Shareholder's Outreach," and
introducing the cast, including Mr. Icahn and three Wall
Street energy analysts, all of whom favor the Icahn proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. Kingsley fed Mr. Icahn questions regarding details of
his proposal and his experience with other proxy contests,
including Texaco Inc. He then turned to analysts to explain
why USX's Marathon Oil is a jewel and should be separated
from U.S. Steel. The show closed with Mr. Kingsley urging
viewers to "vote for proposal No. 4" on the white proxy card.</p>
<p>To complement the one-hour segment, Mr. Icahn also
purchased 30-second commercial time on Financial News Network
urging shareholders to vote with him.</p>
<p>It's believed to be the first time anyone has used
television as a weapon in a proxy battle -- but it's not
likely to be the last. Jonathan Fram, president of
Institutional Research Network, says the television medium
provides a human dimension to faceless players in corporate
battles, and will probably be used more frequently.</p>
<p>"TV imparts the warmth of the players," he says. "It can
take out all the bias. People watch and say, `By golly, he's
a regular guy and he makes sense.'"</p>
<p>Television is also less labor-intensive than traveling
around to meet institutional investors -- a route adopted by
USX. USX executives have spent the last several weeks jetting
about the country to convince top investors and analysts to
vote against Mr. Icahn.</p>
