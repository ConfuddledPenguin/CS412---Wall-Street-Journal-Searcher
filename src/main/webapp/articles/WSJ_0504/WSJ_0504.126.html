	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 509 money-market
mutual funds fell $2.14 billion, to $385.72 billion, for the
week ended Wednesday, after individual investors raided their
fund accounts to pay their taxes.
   The drop, the sixth in a row, was the largest since the
$5.04 billion at June 1, 1988. The numbers for the previous
week were revised to show an $840 million decline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Investment Company Institute, a trade association
based here, said that assets of 161 institutional funds
advanced $1.71 billion, to $92.32 billion; 246
general-purpose funds fell $912.6 million, to $132.70
billion; and 102 broker-dealer funds sank $2.94 billion, to
$160.7 billion.</p>
<p>"The tail end of the tax season continued to be reflected
in last week's changes of money-market fund assets," said
Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the
institute.</p>
<p>"Checks drawn on money-market funds and mailed (to the
Internal Revenue Service) by last-minute filers were
presented for payment last week and caused a sharp drop in
assets held in individual accounts" -- the broker-dealer and
general-purpose categories, he said.</p>
<p>"At the same time," Mr. Dreyer added, "institutional
assets shot up, partly in response to a dip in the federal
funds rate," the interest rate that banks charge each other
on overnight loans.</p>
