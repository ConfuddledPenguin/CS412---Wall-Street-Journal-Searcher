	<p class="article-leader">THE CREDIT SQUEEZE on small business stirs congressional
concern.
   Members of the House Small Business Committee headed by
Democrat John LaFalce of New York applaud the Comptroller of
the Currency's tougher regulation of banks in the wake of the
savings and loan scandal. But some question whether the
agency's "swat teams" are cutting off credit lines to small
businesses with overly strict regulation. "You don't have to
kill the economy to regulate it," said Rep. Ronald Machtley
(R., R.I.) at a hearing last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The comptroller's office insists it isn't targeting
small-business loans or telling banks to whom they can lend.
But experts say the agency effectively sets economic policy
because banks take implicit instructions from its regulatory
practices. Comptroller officials "focus on real estate
assets, but 95% of small businesses pledge real estate assets
{as collateral}, so they're affected to a great degree," says
Joseph Blair, executive director of the Massachusetts
Industrial Finance Agency, which issues bonds to small
concerns.</p>
<p>Of 228 small businesses responding to a survey by the
Massachusetts agency, 106 said they had significant problems
getting credit in the last six months.</p>

<p>MINIMUM-WAGE EXEMPTIONS for small businesses are
threatened.</p>
<p>Small concerns that think they are covered by the new
minimum wage law's exemption for businesses grossing under
$500,000 a year may not really be exempt, says the National
Restaurant Association and other groups. The reason:
Last-minute changes in the law mean that some workers at many
small businesses will have to be paid at least the new
minimum wage of $3.80 an hour after all. The Labor
Department, which will enforce the provision, says workers
involved in any kind of interstate commerce, even handling
credit-card receipts or interstate phone calls, must be paid
the new minimum wage.</p>
<p>"An amendment meant to simplify the small-business
exemption has complicated it to the point where it's
useless," asserts Bud Rusitzky, the restaurant group's
president. Small-business interests hope Sen. James Jeffords
(R., Vt.), who sponsored the exemption for smaller firms,
will sponsor a technical correction measure to save the
endangered exemptions. But his spokesman says he won't seek
any changes now. Many lawmakers fear a revision would reopen
debate on the controversial Fair Labor Standards Act. But the
White House supports a revision.</p>
<p>If Sen. Jeffords won't sponsor the technical correction,
"we'll have to get another horse," says David Rehr, a
National Federation of Independent Business lobbyist.</p>

<p>AMENDMENTS TO EASE small-business concerns about the
potential costs and liabilities of legislation to prohibit
discrimination against the disabled are pursued in the House.
This week, the Judiciary Committee approved changes in rules
governing the hiring and serving of the disabled. The
changes, which were sought by small business, tightened the
definition of a job's "essential functions" and made a
building's owner, not a renter, responsible for required
structural changes. But the panel narrowly rejected an
amendment to delay enforcement of the law until two years
after final rules are written. It also ruled out adding a
$5,000-a-year tax credit for small companies' compliance
costs. Both proposals will be pressed in other committees and
on the House floor.</p>

<p>BUSINESS LUNCH BUNCH: The Senate Democratic Leadership
begins holding regular luncheon meetings with members of the
business community on a broad range of issues. Members of the
Senate Small Business Committee, as well as the National
Federation of Independent Business, National Small Business
United and other small-business groups will be regular
participants, along with representatives of large concerns.</p>

<p>HARD TO SWALLOW: Small wineries protest a plan for a big
tax increase.</p>
<p>Trade groups representing the alcoholic-beverage industry
contend that a proposal by the White House budget office to
raise the occupational tax on wineries and breweries could
put many small wineries out of business. The plan would boost
the annual tax on small wineries to $19,000 from $500, the
industry says. John Volpe, the National Wine Coalition's
executive director, says 1,300 of the nation's 1,500 wineries
gross less than $300,000 a year. "I'm not sure the people who
devised this {tax rise} understand this would cut into the
viability of those businesses," he says.</p>
<p>"If this goes through, you can say goodbye to small
wineries in the U.S.," says Tacie Saltonstall, one of the
owners of King Ferry Winery Inc. in King Ferry, N.Y. Larger
concerns, which now pay a $1,000-a-year tax, also would owe
about $19,000 annually. Overall, the increased tax is
projected to collect about $200 million a year from
alcoholic-beverage producers, wholesalers and retailers, up
from $135 million now. Beer and wine producers say they are
being penalized because many retailers haven't been paying
their taxes up to now; they say the proposal assumes they
could pass along the increase to retailers.</p>
<p>The budget office says the tax increase is just one of
several proposals it is considering to try to make up for the
taxes not paid by retailers.</p>

<p>SMALL TALK: Businesses owned by husbands and wives are the
fastest-growing business segment in the U.S., up 92% from
1980 to 1987, says the Small Business Administration Office
of Advocacy. . . . Green politics and entrepreneurship?
Democratic Rep. Joseph Kennedy 3rd of Massachusetts waxes
that "credit is the sunlight of economic growth. {Small}
businesses require credit like the sea requires the energy of
the sun."</p>
