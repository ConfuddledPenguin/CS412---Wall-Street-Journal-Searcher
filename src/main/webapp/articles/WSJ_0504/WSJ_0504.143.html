	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush, attempting to make a
goodwill gesture toward Iran without negotiating for
hostages, said the U.S. will try to discover the fate of four
Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon.
   Mr. Bush's offer, made at a news conference, doesn't have
much practical effect. U.S. officials and analysts from other
nations have thought for some time that the four Iranians --
three diplomats and a journalist -- have been dead since
shortly after their abduction in 1982. They disappeared near
a checkpoint in Beirut run by Christian militiamen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Bush clearly hopes that his offer will satisfy
Iran's call for a gesture of thanks from the U.S. for its
help in winning the release of two Americans held hostage in
Beirut. "Here's something we can do" without violating U.S.
policy against negotiating for release of hostages, the
president said. Six Americans remain captive in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Iran has long complained that the West, while pressing for
release of its own citizens held hostage in Beirut, has been
silent about the fate of the four Iranians. Mr. Bush said
that the U.S. would "go back and get any information" that
might "relieve the anxieties of the loved ones" of the four
Iranians.</p>
