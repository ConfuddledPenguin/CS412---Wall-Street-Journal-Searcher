	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Westcoast Energy Inc. said
it expects to proceed with a 500 million Canadian dollar
(US$429.2 million) expansion of its pipeline system to
capitalize on a projected 60% jump in its natural gas exports
to the U.S. Pacific Northwest and California by the
mid-1990s.
   "We project that the Pacific Northwest and California will
require an additional 900 million to one billion cubic feet
of natural gas per day during the next five years," said
Michael Phelps, president and chief executive officer of
Westcoast, a pipeline, utility, and oil and gas concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Phelps said he expects British Columbia producers, who
use Westcoast's 1,450-mile system to transport their gas from
the province's burgeoning gas fields, to supply about a third
of the additional U.S.-bound gas exports, or 300 million
cubic feet a day. That would add more than 60% to Westcoast's
1989 gas exports, or 475 million cubic feet a day.</p>
<p>The exports accounted for more than 40% of Westcoast's
record-level daily volume last year of 1.13 billion cubic
feet, a 24% gain over 1988. The growth reflected the buoyant
economies of British Columbia and the U.S. Pacific Northwest,
and a growing appetite for natural gas.</p>
<p>Arthur Willms, Westcoast's chief operating officer, said
its expansion spending would include about C$100 million to
boost capacity on its pipeline -- which interconnects with
Northwest Pipeline Corp.'s system at the Washington state
border -- and an additional C$400 million to expand gas
processing plants and gathering lines.</p>
<p>Westcoast's upbeat export forecast hinges partly on an
expansion of Northwest's 6,500-mile system, which extends
from Washington's border with British Columbia, southeast to
New Mexico. In addition to its primary markets in Washington,
Oregon, and Idaho, the pipeline also serves Southern
California's growing gas markets, through an interconnection
with the El Paso natural gas pipeline.</p>
<p>Northwest, a unit of Tulsa-based Williams Cos., is
discussing a possible expansion of its
two-billion-cubic-foot-a-day pipeline with gas producers and
expects to file an application this summer with U.S.
regulators.</p>
<p>The size of the proposed expansion hasn't been decided,
said Tim Hausler, Northwest's vice president, marketing. But
he said any expansion would help Westcoast, which has
traditionally been locked into the Pacific Northwest market,
and unable to move gas to California, except on a spot basis.</p>
<p>Certainly, Westcoast will face tough competition if it
hopes to win a slice of the California market.</p>
<p>Several other large pipeline companies want a bigger piece
of the pie, including Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s pipeline
unit, which proposes a $1.2 billion expansion of its
Alberta-to-California pipeline.</p>
<p>The proposal by San Fransisco-based Pacific Gas is
competing with the proposed $580 million Altamont pipeline,
sponsored by Houston-based Tenneco Inc., among others.
Altamont would run from Alberta to Wyoming, where it would
tie on to the proposed Kern River pipeline, which would
extend to California. Kern River is backed by Tenneco and
Williams.</p>
<p>But analysts said it would be relatively cheap for
existing pipelines like Westcoast and Northwest to expand
their capacity, and Mr. Willms said Westcoast's spending
plans would have little impact on customer tolls.</p>
<p>The proposals by Pacific Gas and Kern River's backers
would also complement Westcoast's aims, Mr. Phelps said,
because they would provide more direct routes to California,
via an expanded Northwest system.</p>
<p>Northwest's line currently interconnects with the Pacific
Gas system, but the gas flows to Northwest, not to Pacific
Gas and on to California. Paula Rosput, a senior
vice-president with Pacific Gas's pipeline arm, said that
would change if the company's pipeline is expanded.</p>
