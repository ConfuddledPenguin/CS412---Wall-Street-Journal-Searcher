	<p class="article-leader">Leo's Industries Inc. said it completed a private
placement of 442,500 shares of its common stock to several
investors, primarily European banks and insurance companies.
   Leo's, which operates a chain of consumer-electronics
stores and resells cellular phones, abandoned an initial
public offering early this year that had tried to offer a 33%
stake of its cellular-phone unit, Twentieth Century Cellular,
and raise more than $20 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the time the offering was withdrawn, the Long Beach,
Calif., company said it would revert to its initial,
smaller-scale strategy of selling stock privately.</p>
<p>The company's chief financial officer, Merrill Lyons, said
the slight discount given to the buyers was only to
accommodate a two-to-three week holding period until the
shares are registered. He said the proceeds of the sale,
which he wouldn't quantify, would be used for general
coorporate purposes to "strengthen the balance sheet."</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock
Exchange, Leo's shares closed yesterday at $17.75, down 87.5
cents.</p>
