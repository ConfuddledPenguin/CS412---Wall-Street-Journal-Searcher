	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is seeking to
impose a $25 million fine on Drexel Burnham Lambert, even
though the securities firm is liquidating itself, people
familiar with the proceedings said.
   The Big Board also has indicated that it may bring
separate disciplinary proceedings against Drexel Chief
Executive Frederick H. Joseph and other top officers of the
firm in connection with the securities fraud and other crimes
that Drexel and its former junk-bond chief, Michael Milken,
have already admitted to, the people said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among other charges, the exchange is considering
disciplining Mr. Joseph and other Drexel officials for
allegedly failing to properly supervise Mr. Milken and
others, the people said. Such proceedings can result in fines
and suspension from the Big Board.</p>
<p>The Big Board has stepped up its investigation of Drexel
in recent weeks and has subpoenaed several individuals to
testify about wrongdoing by Drexel and Mr. Milken, according
to individuals familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Securities-industry experts said that a $25 million fine
would be the largest ever imposed on a securities firm by the
Big Board. In 1985, after E.F. Hutton & Co. pleaded guilty to
felonies in a check-kiting scheme, it was fined $400,000 by
the exchange. If the Big Board does fine Drexel, it would
likely be the first time the exchange has ever fined a
securities firm that is in liquidation, as Drexel is.</p>
<p>Drexel Burnham Lambert Group filed for bankruptcy-law
protection Feb. 13; its broker-dealer subsidiary, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., is liquidating itself.</p>
<p>While experts said that the Big Board has the right to
sanction Drexel, some questioned the exchange's timing in
doing so now. "It seems like they're beating a dead horse,"
said Alan Bromberg, who teaches securities law at Southern
Methodist University's law school. "I can't see any remedial
purpose to it. Nobody thinking about doing Drexel all over
again will be deterred by this particular fine."</p>
<p>Harvey Pitt, a Washington securities lawyer, said that to
fine Drexel now would be akin to "locking the barn door after
the horses have already gotten out." He said, however, that
"The failure-to-supervise issue has been a significant
question" and one that may be more relevant because many of
Drexel's senior officials may remain in the securities
industry.</p>
<p>The Big Board first privately brought disciplinary charges
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Group and its broker dealer
subsidiary last November; charges haven't been brought
against any of the firm's officials. Drexel is entitled to
fight those charges through a process that includes a
hearing.</p>
<p>In a meeting late last year, Big Board officials said they
wished to fine Drexel $50 million, people familiar with the
matter said. But after Drexel's bankruptcy-law filing, Big
Board officials told the firm that the exchange would be
willing to accept half that amount.</p>
<p>A Drexel spokesman issued the following statement
yesterday: "We understand the stock exchange's need to
project an image of being a strong self-regulator. However,
that should be balanced with a sense of fairness in
evaluating the company's and management's behavior. The
standard ought to be `Was Drexel's compliance as good, or
better, than other firms on the Street and were the systems
diligently used?' We believe they were.</p>
<p>"Moreover, we now know the transgressions chiefly involved
verbal agreements that were not disclosed to the firm and
which no amount of diligence could have detected. It's clear
that there were things that went wrong, but the firm and its
shareholder-employees have already paid dearly for them. Any
further penalties would be added, unnecessary punishment for
creditors and shareholders and could be viewed simply as
piling on."</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange declined to comment.</p>
<p>Before its February bankruptcy-law filing, Drexel pleaded
guilty last year to six felony counts relating to
securities-law violations and agreed to pay $650 million in
fines and restitution. Drexel also signed a sweeping
settlement agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that required a complete overhaul of the firm's
supervisory and compliance procedures.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken also pleaded guilty last week to six separate
felony counts and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and
restitution. Mr. Milken also agreed to settle SEC civil
charges against him.</p>
<p>The SEC hasn't brought any charges or administrative
proceedings against Mr. Joseph or other senior Drexel
officials. Mr. Joseph wasn't implicated in the criminal case
against Drexel and Mr. Milken.</p>
<p>At the time Drexel settled with the SEC last year, some
critics of the settlement pact said they believed Mr. Joseph
should have been sanctioned by the SEC, as many of the crimes
Drexel pleaded guilty to occurred on his watch. But Mr.
Joseph has argued that Drexel had some of the best compliance
procedures in the securities industry, and that all the
crimes committed were so well hidden that they would have
been impossible to detect.</p>
<p>The Big Board has already scheduled a hearing in
connection with its disciplinary charges against Drexel,
people familiar with the matter said. If the exchange's board
of directors approves sanctions against Drexel, the firm
could appeal to a federal court in Manhattan. If the exchange
files charges against Mr. Joseph and others, they would also
be entitled to a Big Board hearing and could later appeal any
sanction to a federal court.</p>
<p>If a Drexel fine is upheld, the Big Board could become yet
another unsecured creditor, bankruptcy lawyers say. While
Drexel shareholders aren't expected to receive much money --
if anything -- for their holdings, the firm's outside
creditors are expected to collect most of what is owed them.</p>
