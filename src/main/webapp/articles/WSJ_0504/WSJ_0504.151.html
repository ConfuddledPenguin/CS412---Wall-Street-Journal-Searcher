	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Tribune Co. Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Stanton R. Cook said at the company's annual meeting
that he would step down as chief executive and as publisher
of the company's flagship paper, the Chicago Tribune.
   Mr. Cook, who will remain as chairman of the media giant,
said Charles T. Brumback, currently president and chief
operating officer of Tribune, would succeed him as chief
executive officer. Mr. Brumback is 61 years old. The changes
will be effective on Aug. 1, following Mr. Cook's 65th
birthday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Cook, a 39-year veteran of the company, has led
Tribune through a period of strong growth since he was named
chief executive in 1974. Mr. Brumback, former president of
Tribune's Orlando Sentinel and of the Chicago Tribune, became
Mr. Cook's heir apparent when he was named president and
chief operating officer of the parent company last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Brumback gave shareholders a "sober" forecast for
1990. He said the soft newspaper advertising market is
expected to mean only modest revenue gains for most Tribune
publications and a decline in revenue at the company's
beleaguered New York Daily News, which is in bitter contract
negotiations with its unions. Newsprint manufacturing
operations also are expected to show a decline in profits,
and even with continued growth in Tribune's broadcast
operations, an earnings gain for the company this year will
be "difficult," Mr. Brumback said.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Tribune stock closed at $39.75 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Tribune had 1989 earnings of $242.4 million, or $3.17 a
primary share, on revenue of $2.45 billion. For the first
quarter of 1990, earnings fell 9%. Mr. Brumback attributed
the decline to higher operating losses at the Daily News and
the declining market for newsprint.</p>
<p>Mr. Cook defended the company against criticism of its
management of the Daily News made by leaders of the Allied
Printing Trades Council of Greater New York and the Chicago
Pressmens' Union, who attended the meeting as shareholders.
Mr. Cook also defended the company's hiring of King & Ballow,
a Nashville, Tenn., law firm that has been sharply attacked
by newspaper labor unions, to handle its negotiations with
the 10 Daily News unions.</p>
<p>Pickets from the Chicago Federation of Labor and from the
New York union group surrounded the meeting's site at the
headquarters of First Chicago Corp., protesting the company's
labor practices at the Daily News and the Tribune.</p>
<p>John W. Madigan, 53 years old, currently president and
chief executive officer of the Chicago Tribune, will succeed
Mr. Cook as publisher of the paper, the top-circulation paper
in metropolitan Chicago.</p>
