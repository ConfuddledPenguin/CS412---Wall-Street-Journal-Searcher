	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Rupert Murdoch wants to prove that global is
better in books.
   Bigness and globalism have attracted other giants in the
book business, including Bertelsmann AG of West Germany,
Hachette S.A. of France and the Simon & Schuster division of
Paramount Communications Inc. But in just a few years, Mr.
Murdoch has come to rival them in size, assembling publishing
operations in the U.S., Europe, Australia, New Zealand and
Canada. The book publishing arm of his News Corp. pumps out
everything from novels to Bibles to road atlases, bringing in
annual revenue of more than $1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Driving this empire is a sometimes-disputed belief that
globalism, especially in the English-speaking world, is the
smartest course for future growth. And behind the wheel is
George Craig, a tall, rumpled Scotsman, who is president and
chief executive officer of News Corp.'s book operations, soon
to be called Harper Collins Publishers.</p>
<p>The two principal entities within Harper Collins are New
York-based Harper & Row and London-based Collins Publishers.
When News Corp. paid $300 million for Harper & Row in 1987,
it was a stodgy, medium-sized company that was barely making
money. Today, it is humming along profitably, and publishing
more best sellers than ever before, a total of 12 in 1989.
Collins, a large, well-respected general publisher known for
its reference books, was family-run for generations until Mr.
Murdoch bought into it, raising his stake to 100% last year
from 40% in 1981.</p>
<p>To build his book empire, Mr. Murdoch tapped Mr. Craig,
the son of a Glasgow steel worker, who got started in
publishing by reorganizing a huge book printing factory for
Collins in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Mr. Craig isn't of the gliterati literati set often found
in the publishing world. He is a businessman first and a team
builder, with a fondness for seeking everyone's ideas on how
to solve problems. The 49-year-old Mr. Craig has a grand
design to exploit synergies between the far-flung operations.
For example: Harper's children's book authors may soon
contribute to books for the Scott, Foresman & Co. division,
which puts out textbooks; Collins marketing practices that
doubled British sales of Agatha Christie mysteries are being
applied to Harper paperbacks in America; Mr. Craig borrowed
some of the U.K. management from Collins's successful line of
datebooks and diaries to start a similar business in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The bigger-is-better philosophy has its skeptics. Many
veteran publishers insist there are few if any economies of
scale in this low-margin, cyclical business, where each book
is a new risk. Moreover, many in the industry worry about the
loss of independence and a separate identity for publishing
concerns swallowed up by giants such as News Corp.</p>
<p>"You can't move ideas, techniques and technologies from
another country and jam them down people's throats," says
Charles Elbaum, a publishing consultant in New York. Mr.
Elbaum notes how Bertelsmann lost money when it tried to run
the Literary Guild and other U.S. book clubs the way it runs
its German book clubs. If Harper Collins "will create
semi-autonomous operating units and allow them the discretion
to customize market and product, globalization has a decent
chance of working," Mr. Elbaum adds.</p>
<p>News Corp.'s $6 billion in debt is likely to hamper Mr.
Craig's more ambitious expansion plans; Harper Collins's own
heavy debt is forcing the company to sell about $500 million
of publishing assets, including a bookstore chain in
Australia and its Philadelphia-based J.B. Lippincott medical
publishing unit.</p>
<p>Critics at competing publishing houses add that profits at
Harper Collins also will be squeezed by the hefty advances
the company has paid to win best-selling authors. In starting
up a new paperback arm at Harper's, Mr. Craig spent $1
million on the rights for one novel alone, "Billy Bathgate"
by E.L. Doctorow. (Mr. Craig justifies the big advances by
saying: "We're acquiring authors, not just books.")</p>
<p>In going global, Mr. Craig has stepped on toes. The
decision to adopt the name Harper Collins and use a standard
logo and typeface on every book jacket, in addition to
imprints like Harper & Row, was viewed as so demoralizing
that it helped drive the head of Collins to resign.</p>
<p>Sonia Land, former chief executive of Collins, says she
told Mr. Craig: "Collins built its reputation on that name.
It would be terribly wrong to change that." Mr. Craig's
response, says Ms. Land, was: "But we are a world-wide
publishing group. International branding is what we're all
about."</p>
<p>(Mr. Craig will say only that they had "differences of
opinion.")</p>
<p>"I think the name change could crank up the argument that
publishing is now run by faceless conglomerates," says a
recently departed Collins division head. "But I think most
people do recognize that publishing is global now. Still, the
people who work at Collins have had a lot of changes to come
to terms with, and I think the task ahead is to convince them
of the benefits of globalization."</p>
<p>And how to do that? "You get the right people together and
keep them communicating," says Mr. Craig, a former accountant
who came to Collins after stints at computer and detergent
companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Craig is known for gathering managers into
brainstorming sessions. Standing next to his trademark flip
chart, he scribbles down everybody's ideas. The free-flowing
debates may address the pros and cons of mergers and even the
renaming of the company.</p>
<p>An open cross-fertilization is getting results. Harper
Collins bilingual dictionaries will soon be sold to high
schools and colleges through Scott Foresman, the textbook
company that News Corp. bought late last year. Scott
Foresman, in turn, publishes Robert's Rules of Order, which
Harper & Row is better equipped to market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zondervan, the big religious publisher acquired
by News Corp. in 1988, has had trouble placing some of its
titles in regular bookstores, but is doing better with the
help of Harper, which will also co-publish some. Coming in
August: the autobiography of former football coach Tom
Landry, an evangelical Christian.</p>
<p>In the U.K., Collins has a reputation for aggressive
marketing (sales of its road atlases soared after posters
reading "Get Collins or Get Lost" went up near major
roadways) while Harper & Row has been viewed as unimaginative
in that area. To inject marketing sizzle here, Scotsman Eddie
Bell has been imported from Collins to run the new
mass-market paperback business. In England, Mr. Bell used
focus groups to pinpoint why sales were dropping for Agatha
Christie novels. One problem was the covers, which looked too
much like stock, violent mysteries. The jacket art was redone
in a stylish, art deco design and the price was raised
considerably; sales of the newly classy Christie's doubled in
one year. Now that Harper has bought U.S. paperback rights
for about 30 Christie titles, it may be able to transfer some
of Mr. Bell's knowledge.</p>
<p>Mr. Craig is a big proponent of buying "English-language
rights world-wide" for books, so that printing and marketing
can be executed globally, but he realizes that approach isn't
always practical or desirable. Some of Harper's recent best
sellers (such as "Barbarians at the Gate") weren't picked up
by Collins in England, while others ("Roseanne] My Life as a
Woman") were.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Craig believes global transference makes
better sense for children's, religious and reference books,
it doesn't seem likely that Harper Collins textbook
subsidiaries in the U.S. and the U.K. will ship books back
and forth. The differences in the two countries' teaching
practices and curricula are too great.</p>
<p>There are useful ties developing between Harper Collins
and other News Corp. holdings. Mr. Murdoch owns New York
magazine, whose editor sits on Harper's editorial board. It
was clearly helpful to Harper to have a profile of author Dr.
Bernie Siegel ("Love, Medicine and Miracles") on the cover of
New York magazine last June, right before his second book was
published.</p>
<p>And there is Mr. Murdoch's fledgling television network,
Fox, whose show "America's Most Wanted" was the subject of a
best-selling Harper paperback. In recent weeks, the creator
of Fox's new animated hit, "The Simpsons," left another
publisher to sign on with Harper for a reported seven
figures. Cartoonist Matt Groening was being pursued by a pack
of publishers, but was wooed to Harper with the extra
persuasion of Fox executives.</p>
