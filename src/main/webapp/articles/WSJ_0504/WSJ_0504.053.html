	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- CalMat Co. said it received state court
approval for a settlement of shareholder lawsuits against the
company and certain directors that claimed the defendants
used unfair tactics to block a 1988 takeover attempt by
Brierley Investments Ltd.
   In a statement, CalMat denied any liability on the claims.
Dan Mogin, a lawyer for the shareholders, said plaintiffs'
experts said the settlement has a potential value ranging
from $30 million to more than $100 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The partial settlement ends the involvement of CalMat, its
directors and a subsidiary of Onoda Finance Co. of Tokyo, but
claims are still pending against New Zealand financier Sir
Ronald Brierley and his Brierley Investments, as well as
certain of the New Zealand company's officers and
subsidiaries. A suit was filed against those defendants in
federal court in San Diego alleging violation of federal
anti-racketeering and securities law in February, Mr. Mogin
said. Brierley officials didn't return phone calls seeking
comment.</p>
<p>The settlement calls for CalMat to pay a special dividend
of at least 10 cents a share to certain shareholders of
record on a stipulated date, and to buy back one million
shares of common stock within 120 trading days. Within 30
months, CalMat must spend at least an additional $30 million
to buy back more shares, pay additional special dividends, or
both.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
CalMat closed at $32.50 a share, up 50 cents. The
construction-materials company has about 30 million common
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>CalMat will spend at least 50% of the net proceeds of its
real estate divestiture program through Dec. 31, 1991, to pay
for the repurchase of stock and the special dividends. It
wasn't clear how much real estate CalMat intends to sell, and
CalMat executives weren't immediately available to clarify
the settlement. Mr. Mogin said it is impossible to say how
much CalMat will eventually pay out to shareholders covered
by the suit.</p>
<p>The complex settlement includes, among other things,
changes in CalMat's handling of any acquisition queries and
calls for a shareholder vote on an anti-greenmail resolution.</p>
<p>The shareholder suits stemmed from events in late 1987 and
1988 that included CalMat's rejection of an unsolicited
$40-a-share takeover bid from Brierley. In July 1988, CalMat
announced a major restructuring that scuttled the bid, which
had an indicated value of $987 million.</p>
<p>As part of the restructuring, the company agreed to sell a
cement subsidiary to Onoda Cement Co. of Japan. The
transaction included the repurchase of a "significant" number
of CalMat shares.</p>
<p>The shareholders claimed the defendants disguised an
indirect greenmail payment to Sir Ronald, in which the
investor sold his stake in Calmat to Onoda at a premium to
the market price, and Onoda promised to sell the stake to
CalMat at a profit. The shareholders also claimed Onoda
bought the CalMat assets for less than their true value.</p>
