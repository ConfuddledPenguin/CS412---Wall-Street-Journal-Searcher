	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Colt Industries Inc. said it changed its name
to Coltec Industries Inc., effective yesterday, reflecting
the company's sale of its firearms business March 22, a
spokesman said.
   Excluding the firearms business, which accounted for only
6% of the company's $1.61 billion in sales last year, Coltec
now has businesses in aerospace, automotive and other
industrial products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Coltec currently is owned by Colt Holdings Inc., which
took Colt Industries private in June 1988.</p>
