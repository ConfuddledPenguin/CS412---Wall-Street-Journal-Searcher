	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- URS Corp. said it is closing its software
unit, Mitchell Management Systems Inc. in Westborough, Mass.,
resulting in a $7.5 million loss from discontinued operations
in its fiscal second quarter ended April 30.
   The closing puts URS in violation of certain covenants of
its credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, but the bank has
given URS a 90-day forbearance while discussions concerning
the breach take place. The company said the closing won't
affect its ability to pay back debt, because future cash flow
will be strengthened. Mitchell contributed 8% of URS's fiscal
1989 revenue of $99.5 million, and reported pretax losses of
$1.4 million. In the first half of the current fiscal year,
the unit's losses accelerated to $3.3 million, according to
URS, an engineering and architectural consulting concern.</p>
