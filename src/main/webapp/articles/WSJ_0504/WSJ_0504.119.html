	<p class="article-leader">Copperweld Corp. said the special meeting to vote on the
proposed merger of Copperweld into Imetal, a French concern
that already controls Copperweld, will be delayed for
procedural reasons.
   The meeting was set for June 6 but will be postponed until
early July, the Pittsburgh company said. Copperweld said it
won't have required materials from the Securities and
Exchange Commission until late this month, which wouldn't
allow time to mail proxy materials for a June 6 meeting.</p>
