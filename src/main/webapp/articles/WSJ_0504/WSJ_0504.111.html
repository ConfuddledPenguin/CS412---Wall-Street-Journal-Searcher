	<p class="article-leader">Deutsche Lufthansa AG Chairman Heinz Ruhnau said the West
German airline will hire approximately 500 employees of
German Wings, a Munich-based private air carrier that filed
for bankruptcy this week.
   Mr. Ruhnau told reporters that Frankfurt-based Lufthansa
had planned to add 3,500 employees this year anyway. He said
he ordered personnel directors to give priority to job
applicants from German Wings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Lufthansa chairman said the company has little
interest in taking over German Wings's six leased McDonnell
Douglas Corp. MD-83 twin jets, because they don't fit into
Lufthansa's own fleet.</p>
<p>With regards to Interflug, the East German national
airline, Mr. Ruhnau said he favored increased cooperation
between the two German carriers, but foresees a future where
both continue to operate independently, even after the
planned unification of the two Germanys.</p>
<p>Lufthansa is in the process of acquiring a 26% stake in
Interflug; the two companies have also set up a catering
joint venture.</p>
