	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Phoenix Re Corp. reported a first-quarter loss
and declining revenue, due mostly to catastrophic events in
Europe.
   The loss was $1.9 million, or 48 cents a share, compared
with profit of $1.5 million, or 37 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue for the quarter declined 15% to $8.3 million
from $9.8 million a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loss stemmed primarily from three European storms and
a major hailstorm in Sydney, Australia. Phoenix, which
provides reinsurance products and services internationally,
said it had set aside a $4 million loss reserve for claims
arising from these events.</p>
