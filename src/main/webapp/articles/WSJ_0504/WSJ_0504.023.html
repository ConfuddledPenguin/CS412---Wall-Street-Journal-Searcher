	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Continued weakness in the U.S. steel market could
lead to a drop of more than 7% in steel shipments in 1990
compared with 1989, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development said.
   At the same time, weak prices in the U.S. and world
markets generally, together with lower production levels and
higher costs, "may present some threat to continued
profitable operations in the U.S. industry in 1990."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group said the downturn in U.S. steel demand at the
end of 1989 has continued through the 1990 first quarter,
although the OECD said the drop "has not yet become severe."</p>
