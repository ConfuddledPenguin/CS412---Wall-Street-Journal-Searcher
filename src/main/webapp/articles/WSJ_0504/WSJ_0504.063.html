	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The profit recession among U.S. corporations
isn't over yet, but look for a turnaround this quarter,
investors and strategists say.
   First-quarter earnings for the more than 700 stocks in the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 7.5% to $41.5 billion from
$44.9 billion a year earlier. For the second quarter, the
earnings are expected to rise about 0.8% to $47.5 billion
from $47.2 billion a year earlier, according to Zacks
Investment Research.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First-quarter earnings fell about 3% short of analysts'
expectations, according to Zacks. It was bad earnings news
and rising interest rates that sent stocks tumbling again
last month.</p>
<p>Negative earnings "surprises" were generally larger than
positive ones. For those companies with disappointing
profits, earnings averaged 58.5% below the consensus estimate
of at least three analysts. By contrast, positive earnings
surprises averaged 36.6% above analyst predictions.</p>
<p>Investors and strategists don't expect a big rebound in
profits in the current quarter. But by the second half,
profits -- and the stock market -- could be climbing more
discernibly. Meanwhile, it's still smart to hang on to growth
stocks that may perform better than the overall market, some
investors say.</p>
<p>For example, earnings at many computer companies, such as
Compaq Computer Corp., are growing at a rate of 15% a year or
more, and computer stocks are significantly ahead of the
market this year. As of yesterday's close, the computer-stock
group including International Business Machines Corp. was up
11.2% so far this year, compared with a decline for the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index of 5.2%.</p>
<p>Strategists at Shearson Lehman Hutton are bullish on the
outlook for corporate profits. Inventory rebuilding, capital
spending, and stable consumer demand will continue to keep
the economy growing, says Michael Sherman, chief investment
strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>"We're betting that the economy will continue to grow and
that profits will recover and that this will continue through
next year," says Mr. Sherman.</p>
<p>But earnings aren't expected to snap back robustly for all
companies. "It's not like we are coming out of a recession
and everybody is lean and mean, and profits soar," says A.
Marshall Acuff Jr., portfolio strategist at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. "There will continue to be stocks that
slip and slide."</p>
<p>An earnings rebound may be seen in companies that produce
basic materials, such as aluminum and chemicals, because
inventories are tighter and prices are heading up. But
investors are cautious about these stocks, showing there
isn't widespread conviction that earnings will surge ahead
sharply.</p>
<p>"I haven't done much on the commodity-producing and
cyclical-stock side," says Michael Schonberg, managing
director at Chase Investors Management Corp. "The timing is
still questionable. The turn in earnings will be a slow
turn."</p>
<p>Mr. Schonberg says growth stocks have been leading the
market this year and he expects them to continue to in that
role for the time being. Some of his favorites in that
category include Waste Management, Philip Morris and
Schering-Plough.</p>
<p>But despite a negative earnings surprise in the
financial-services group of 6.3%, Mr. Schonberg is prepared
to pick through the rubble in search of a good investing
opportunity. He says he has found one in American Express
Co., and has plunked down a "major" amount of money recently
for some shares. As of yesterday's close, the
financial-services industry group was down 13.4% on the year,
while American Express is down 24%.</p>
<p>"This is a stock that is historically sensitive to turns
in earnings; the travel-related services business is a good
growth story masked by a brokerage business that has been in
a terrible trend."</p>
