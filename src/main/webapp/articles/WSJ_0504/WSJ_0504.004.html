	<p class="article-leader">DAYTON, Ohio -- Philips Industries Inc. reported a net
loss of $45.3 million, or $1.60 a share, for the its fourth
quarter ended March 31 as a result of restructuring costs and
charges related to a failed takeover effort totaling $50.3
million after taxes.
   The diversified producer of construction, transportation
and industrial products earned $8.5 million, or 29 cents a
share, in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales declined 11% to $219.7 million from $245.6 million
in the year-earlier period. The company isn't related to
Philips Industries N.V. of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Philips decided to sell some businesses and consolidate
others following collapse of a planned $700 million buy-out
of Philips by a new company established by Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc. The charges, $59.2 million before
taxes, reflect anticipated losses on sale of businesses,
restructuring costs and buy-out-related charges.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year, Philips reported a loss of $14.6
million, or 51 cents a share, versus a profit of $46.3
million, or $1.61 a share, for fiscal 1989. Sales were $927.5
million, down slightly from $941.7 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Excluding the unusual charges, the company had pretax
profit of $52.7 million, down 29% from $74 million in fiscal
1989. About $8 million of the drop was in operating profit of
subsidiaries Philips intends to sell, the company said.
Philips previously said it intends to sell its conveyor and
aluminum wheel businesses.</p>
<p>The $7.5 million of after-tax, buy-out-related expenses
will be taken in fiscal 1990 if the merger agreement with the
Merrill Lynch unit is terminated before Philips releases
final figures for the year. However, if the agreement isn't
terminated until after the report is released, the loss will
be recognized when the agreement is terminated, Philips said.</p>
<p>Philips repeated an earlier statement that the Merrill
Lynch unit still is interested in a transaction with Philips
if a new bargain can be negotiated that meets with the
approval of all parties. The buy-out group couldn't obtain
financing for the transaction negotiated last year.</p>
<p>Philips also repeated that it has provided certain
information to another party that indicated possible interest
in a transaction with Philips. But Philips said it is unable
to predict whether any merger transaction will occur. A
Philips spokesman said yesterday that there are no new
developments and declined to identify the party to whom
Philips provided information.</p>
