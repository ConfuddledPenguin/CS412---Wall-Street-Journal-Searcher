	<p class="article-leader">Your March 22 page-one article about banks getting tough
with their small-business customers is ironic ("Credit
Crunch: As Banks Get Tough With Borrowers, Fears of a
Recession Rise").
   Now that the highfliers have gone bad, the banks clamp
down on the little guy -- the solid citizens of American
Business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Is the small-business man the "bread and butter" of the
banks? Only when it comes to deposits and monthly bank
charges. Perhaps small-business men should consider imitating
the highfliers of land development. Free gold at a new
resort? Free membership at our health spa?</p>
<p>I think the next time any small-business man makes a
banking decision, he had best ask the bank for the same
information it wants from him. How good is your collateral,
Mr. Banker? Would you give me a personal guarantee on any
losses in my account, Mr. Banker? Deposits are a loan. Let
the lender beware.</p>

<p>The current credit crunch illustrates a fact that neither
lenders nor borrowers like to admit: The longer you are with
a lender, the more vulnerable you are to having your credit
terminated.</p>
<p>That's because eventually every lender's credit policy
will change, and any tightening always hurts small and
midsize companies the most. Meanwhile, you've lost touch with
other lenders and let your loan-presentation skills become
rusty.</p>
<p>We urge middle-market companies to maintain contact with
several lenders -- do business with more than one, if
possible. And just because you've been with the same lender
for 10 or 20 years, don't think you're secure.</p>
