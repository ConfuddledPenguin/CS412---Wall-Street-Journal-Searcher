	<p class="article-leader">Opposing a bill that has been named "The Civil Rights Act
of 1990" is not politically easy; the deck has already been
rhetorically stacked. But the proposed legislation is deeply
flawed. The title of the bill and the voices of Coretta Scott
King and others in support of it all suggest continuity with
the great civil rights statutes of the 1960s. In fact, the
issues the 1990 bill raises have none of the moral simplicity
of those earlier days.
   It is the attempt to overturn last term's Supreme Court
decision in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio that is most
troubling. Employment patterns in an Alaskan salmon cannery
were the issue in Wards Cove. The "non-cannery" jobs were
generally held by whites, while Filipinos, Eskimos and Aleuts
filled most of the unskilled "cannery" positions. The
plaintiffs charged discrimination. But how telling was the
disproportionate concentration of minority employees in the
lower paying jobs? Not as telling as the plaintiffs claim,
the Supreme Court said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Civil rights groups depict the decision as a betrayal; the
court reneged on an earlier commitment, they say. And indeed,
Wards Cove has made it harder for minority plaintiffs to
prevail. A 1971 decision (Griggs v. Duke Power Co.) forced
employers to defend their hiring practices as a "business
necessity" if plaintiffs could point to a "racially disparate
impact"fewer blacks than whites passing, say, an aptitude
test.</p>
<p>The problem with Griggs was the assumption that numbers --
the number of blacks in one job category and the number of
whites in another -- tell much of what you want to know in an
employment discrimination case. And the strength of Wards
Cove was that it refined -- in an elementary, common-sense
manner -- the statistical rule. Minorities may be
disproportionately concentrated in unskilled positions or may
disproportionately fail an aptitude or other test, the court
said, but the relevant question is the size of the pool of
minority candidates qualified to fill the jobs in question.
And if the numbers alone tell less than the Griggs court
assumed they would, then a showing of disparate impact should
not place the burden of proof on employers to demonstrate the
"business necessity" of their hiring procedures. Plaintiffs
who charge discrimination should have to prove their case.</p>
<p>Within limits, numbers are telling in discrimination
cases. No one would argue otherwise. But only in exceptional
circumstances should they be regarded as conclusive, or
nearly so. The 1965 Voting Rights Act is instructive in this
regard. It was precisely the point of the act to substitute a
statistical rule of thumb for the extended and complex
judicial process by which Fifteenth Amendment questions were
traditionally decided. The act identified a violation
wherever voter registration or turnout in the presidential
election of 1964 fell below 50% and a literacy test was used
to screen potential registrants. All states and counties
fitting those criteria were "covered" and thus subject to a
set of stringent remedies.</p>
<p>At the time, critics complained that justice could not be
measured by percentages and that fair enforcement of the
Fifteenth Amendment required the precise identification of
offenders, which the statistical formula did not provide. But
in fact the act did not rely excessively on numerical
indicators. Framed with meticulous care, informed by years of
litigation experience, the 1965 statute swiftly accomplished
what no previous law had achieved: the enfranchisement of
Southern blacks.</p>
<p>The statistical test allowed the finding of vote denial by
a simple formula, eliminating the need to ferret out
constitutional violations in states with abominable records
with respect to black voting rights. By 1965 the excessive
cost and limited effectiveness of the traditional judicial
route had become abundantly clear. And what the framers of
the act wrote into law was only what the litigators had
learned in the field. The statistical test simply
acknowledged the proven link -- proven in countless suits --
between fraudulently administered Southern literacy tests and
low levels of voter participation. Aware that literacy tests
were the chief means of disfranchising Southern blacks, the
framers of the 1965 act used voter registration and turnout
figures to devise a statistical means to identify the
discriminatory use of literacy tests.</p>
<p>But those circumstances were unique. In 1965 low voter
registration rates were an almost infallible guide to the
intentionally discriminatory use of literacy tests. Equally
important, citizens over 18, with few exceptions, have a
right to vote; that's what democracies are all about.
Employment is very different. Statistical information is not
a comparably reliable sign of intentional discrimination --
of a desire to exclude blacks from certain jobs. And no one
is entitled to a particular category of job in a particular
place of employment.</p>
<p>Thus, when it comes to jobs, numbers can serve to alert
employers, employees and courts to the possibility of
discrimination. But numbers should only set off an inquiry.
Other questions must then take over. Again, the history of
the Voting Rights Act is instructive. In the enforcement of
the statute, the initially legitimate use of numerical
indicators has expanded to one that is highly questionable.
Courts and the Justice Department have arrived at a new
statistical rule of thumb: Where minority officeholding is
disproportionately low in relation to the minority
population, electoral exclusion can almost be assumed. Only
blacks can represent blacks, it is apparently believed, and
black candidates lose elections for only one reason: race.</p>
<p>Those assumptions last week informed the Justice
Department decision to throw out Georgia's system of electing
judges. True, the number of superior court judges in the
state is disproportionately low in relation to the black
population. Even in majority-black Atlanta, only three out of
11 judges are black. But how large is the pool of qualified
attorneys eager for judgeships? How many black voters bother
to cast ballots in judicial elections -- contests that are
often ignored by almost everyone? And how often does any
candidate -- white or black -- win against an incumbent?
Again, the numbers raise questions. But, as the court in
Wards Cove understood, they don't provide the answers.</p>
<p>In voting rights cases, electoral defeat is not conclusive
evidence of inadequate electoral opportunity, and opportunity
should be the question. Likewise, the failure to pass an
employer's test is not strong evidence of a system closed to
minority aspirations. The point of antidiscrimination laws is
not to protect black candidates from white competition --
whether the job in question is in politics or industry. Their
point is to provide access, and, again, only in the most
extraordinary circumstances can access be gauged from
statistical evidence. Access normally raises a question about
process, not results. Is the electoral- or hiring-process
distorted by racism? Has opportunity been blocked by racist
assumptions?</p>
<p>An emphasis on opportunity, or fair process, squares with
our traditional and continuing understanding of what
Americans are entitled to. To focus on numerical results is
to invite quotas. And quotas amount to reserved seats for
scheduled castes, as in India where the horizons of trust do
not extent beyond ethnic boundaries. That, too, is a lesson
contained in the history of the Voting Rights Act. We can
take the path of pessimism -- of assuming that members of
minority groups cannot get a "fair shake" and must be given
their "fair share."</p>
<p>Or we can structure our legal system -- our electoral and
employment processes, among others -- to deliver a message
that minority groups amount to separate nations and separate
nations require distinct treatment. That message runs through
much civil rights discussion these days. But it should not
inform our law.</p>
