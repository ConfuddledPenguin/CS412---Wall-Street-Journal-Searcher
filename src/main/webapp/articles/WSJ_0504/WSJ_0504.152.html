<p>At Prudential-Bache, a spokeswoman said, "The events
underlying this occurred well over three years ago. We
discovered the problem, terminated the employee, and we
settled the matter to put it behind us."</p>
<p>Mr. Keeton said, "No NASD rules or regulations were
willfully or knowingly violated. No written supervisory or
underwriting NASD guidelines existed at the NASD member
broker-dealer I was formerly associated with. . . . No
investors or issuers of securities have incurred any damages
or filed any claims alleging damages related to this NASD
action." Mr. Keeton added that "a claim for compensatory
damages" against an NASD member and the NASD itself "is being
prepared."</p>
<p>At RJO Securities Inc., President Robert O'Brien Jr. said,
"RJO and its employees always have made a good-faith effort
to comply with NASD rules, and any violation was entirely
inadvertent. The matter was settled to avoid the cost of
litigation and to avoid the distractions and disruptions in
normal business which would occur during such litigation."</p>
<p>Mr. Edgeton said that he disagrees with the NASD's
findings and that he didn't have an opportunity to present
his side because he was unable to go to the hearing in
Chicago. He added that "there was a misunderstanding about
some things that happened."</p>
<p>At Shearson, a spokesman said, "This involves a number of
procedural issues, and we agreed to the fine to put the
matter behind us. We have an ongoing system of monitoring all
advertising and sales literature to ensure compliance with
all appropriate regulations."</p>
<p>Mr. Swink declined to comment on behalf of Swink & Co.
W.N. Whelen also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Messrs. Houseman and Allison declined to comment.</p>
