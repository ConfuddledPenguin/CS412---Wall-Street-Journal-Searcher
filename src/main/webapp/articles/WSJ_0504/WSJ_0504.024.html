	<p class="article-leader">Kentucky Derby Day is upon us again, and I suppose you'd
like to know who's going to win. Look no further; the pitcher
is in focus.
   "I like Unbridled," says the pitcher, Rob Murphy of the
Boston Red Sox. "I base the pick mostly on breeding -- he's
the only colt in the field who got a `yes' on my rating
system as a yearling -- but he's also a late runner in a
field with a lot of early speed. Plus, you should get a good
price on him."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, you well may ask why Murphy, a dark-haired,
left-handed reliever of imposing stuff and mien, has been
summoned from the bullpen as a horse-racing expert. The
answer is because he is one. When he's not setting up saves
for Lee Smith or Jeff Reardon, he's exercising his computer,
seeking likely prospects for the horse-buying partnerships he
forms and manages.</p>
<p>His company, M375 Thoroughbreds, is doing quite nicely,
thanks. In business since 1984, it currently has shares in
four racing animals, three unraced two-year-olds, three
broodmares and six yearlings or sucklings. All four runners
have recorded victories, and their combined winnings of about
$200,000 have almost doubled their purchase prices.</p>
<p>And that could be just the start. "We've been limited by
the money at our disposal, but this fall we plan to be more
ambitious," says Rob. "I might put together a players' group,
and I certainly intend to get involved more heavily myself.</p>
<p>"In case you haven't heard," he adds with a wink,
"ballplayers make pretty good money these days."</p>
<p>The husky, 29-year-old Murphy is in that category, having
inked a contract that will pay him a total of $1.85 million
for this season and next. He qualified for that princely sum
by being the Major Leagues' busiest hurler over the past
three campaigns in terms of appearances (237), and by
inducing most of batters he faced to retire without much
fuss.</p>
<p>The log for Murphy's four years in the Bigs -- three with
the Cincinnati Reds and one with Boston -- shows an earned
run average of 2.65 and 317 strikeouts in 344 innings. He's
putting them out in style again this term, with 19 K's in 16
innings through Tuesday.</p>
<p>Unlike some play-for-payers, though, Murphy knows that
muscular heroics won't last, and this is where his horse
business comes in. It's perhaps no wonder that he's attracted
to the breeding end of the turf sport, because he has been
bred for it himself. His maternal grandfather, Frank Ashley,
was a well-known race announcer, and his grandma, Rose
LeDuke, kept charts for the Daily Racing Form. His father's
stepfather, Fred Smith, was a top jockey during the 1940s.
His dad, Bob, a building contractor, raises and races horses
out of his Early Morning Farm in Ocala, Fla.</p>
<p>"We were a typical American family, except that we spent
all our holidays at the track," the pitcher recalls.</p>
<p>Murphy got plugged into computers as a high schooler in
his native Miami, and learned early on that he could combine
his interests profitably. He and a friend designed a
handicapping program for a computer class, and got an "A" by
correctly picking Affirmed, Alydar and Believe It to finish
1-2-3 in the 1978 Kentucky Derby. Affirmed turned out to be a
great horse, so hindsight might adjudge the feat
unremarkable. But Affirmed was the second betting choice to
Alydar on Derby Day, and Believe It went off at 7-to-1.</p>
<p>Murphy continued his computer studies at the U.'s of
Florida and Kentucky, but stowed his racing yen because he
was happily mowing 'em down on the diamonds. He revived it in
1983 after three so-so seasons of Class A ball in the Reds'
chain seemed to have dead-ended his career. That was partly
because a minor-league coach, who shall be unnamed, decided
that the game needed a 6-foot-2, 215-pound knuckleballer, and
induced Murphy to adopt the erratic pitch.</p>
<p>"It was either my having a great spring in '84, or finding
something else to do," Rob says. "I figured I needed an
alternate plan."</p>
<p>So he sat himself down before a computer and plumbed
racing's voluminous breeding stats, seeking the familial and
running characteristics that produced the most-successful
offspring. Working 16 hours a day for six months, he
identified 36 traits that seemed to count most, finding,
among other things, that the best racers usually had parents
who won fast races very early in their careers. Then he
backtested his program on the 26,129 horses that had been
offered for sale over a nine-year period at the four major
U.S. yearling sales.</p>
<p>It gave a "yes" to just 433 animals, 1.7% of those
auctioned. Of those, 117 turned into stakes winners, about 10
times the proportion of the group as a whole.</p>
<p>Other things about his program pleased him. "I wasn't only
identifying horses that sold for six figures and up; I found
the sleepers, too," he says. Among those were Spectacular
Bid, the $37,000 purchase who won the 1979 Derby, and Seattle
Slew, the '77 Triple Crown champ who'd been bought for a
bargain $17,500. Slew's "yes" sparked special delight because
he was Murphy's favorite horse. In celebration, he named his
company M375, which is "SLEW" spelled upside down and
backward.</p>
<p>Murphy chucked the knuckler for the fastball and curve
that had made him a prospect, thus earning a "save" on his
baseball life, but pressed on with his equine endeavors.
Offering his services as an agent, he bought five horses for
a Seattle man, all of which posted wins, but clients declined
to take other recommendations that were to gain greater
glory. Frustration over such misfires led to his present
determination to oversee his own buying and racing
syndicates.</p>
<p>Murphy lights up his computer almost everywhere, including
team flights, and has refined his program to encompass 55
traits. His tapping engendered some locker-room ribbing in
his early days in the Bigs, but now brings mostly requests to
invest. He says that a nice thing about being a ballplayer is
that it allows plenty of time for other activities. "The bus
for the park usually leaves about 4:30 p.m. If I get up at 9
a.m., I can put in a full day's work," he notes.</p>
<p>Amazing what a guy can do if he doesn't watch cartoons,
isn't it?</p>
