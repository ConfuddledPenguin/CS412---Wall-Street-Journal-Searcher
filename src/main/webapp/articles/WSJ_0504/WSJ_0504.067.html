   For the first time, the nation's three major stock markets
will be mounting big advertising campaigns simultaneously in
which they boast about themselves and belittle their
competition. The campaigns reflect how competitive Wall
Street has gotten as trading volume has shriveled since the
1987 stock market crash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock exchanges have run ads for some time, of course. But
there are several twists to the current binge -- including
first-ever television ads by the Nasdaq over-the-counter
market, in which it declares the high-technology Nasdaq is
"The Stock Market for the Next 100 Years." Meanwhile, the New
York Stock Exchange (the stock market for the past 200 years)
has raised eyebrows among competitors with a renewed
aggressiveness in its ads, which focus on swaying not just
investors and corporate America, but financial journalists as
well.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange, a distant third behind the
others, joined the ad frenzy this week by announcing it had
retained an agency to launch a major campaign of its own.</p>
<p>"Today, the exchanges are being very competitive," says
the New York Stock Exchange's top public-relations man,
Richard Torrenzano. "You want to make sure people are aware
of what's going on, the kinds of companies listed with you
and why they want to list."</p>
<p>The Big Board has two sets of ads. One set includes
corporate chieftains, including such Nasdaq "defectors" as
Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., saying nice things
about the Big Board. The other campaign is a copy-heavy
description of the exchange and its workings that is meant to
establish it firmly as America's main market. This campaign
has even run in journalist trade publications, as part of
what the exchange says is a bid to sway "opinion leaders."</p>
<p>The Big Board ads are striking because they specifically
criticize the OTC market, and even take shots at regional
stock exchanges that have been eating into the Big Board's
market share. Some of the Big Board ads contain what amounts
to a warning against trading stocks on regional exchanges. "I
don't know why they have to do that," protests the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange's president, Nicholas Giordano,
who says all stock exchanges should cooperate to try to lure
back small investors.</p>
<p>But the main PR fight going on so far is between the Big
Board and the sprawling Nasdaq market. By far the two biggest
stock markets in the U.S., they have fought for years for
listings of prized companies. The Big Board would love to
snare such brand-name Nasdaq companies as Apple Computer, MCI
Communications and Intel, and Nasdaq knows it.</p>
<p>Nasdaq has three TV ads so far, produced by the Messner
Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer agency, that have run in the
New York City area starting with the Masters golf tournament
last month. Its print ads include testimonials from the heads
of Apple and MCI, and a new one will feature the Ben &
Jerry's Homemade Inc. ice cream entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>One of the TV ads is a downright Big Board basher. With a
solemn soundtrack of medieval chanting, the ad shows a
slow-motion scene of a trading floor in which
maniacal-looking brokers are waving their arms and barking
orders; one broker appears to be foaming at the mouth. The
narration: "Is there a rational alternative to the
traditional trading floor? Yes. Not having one." Fade in on
the Nasdaq logo.</p>
<p>Brian Holland, senior vice president of marketing for the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs
Nasdaq, says that despite appearances, his market isn't
personally attacking the Big Board. It's merely trying to
"build awareness in the public" that the Nasdaq market is
available, and more importantly, that the Nasdaq system is
separate from the OTC marketplace as a whole. "People don't
realize, based on our research, that there are other ways to
trade" besides the traditional stock exchange, Mr. Holland
says.</p>
<p>As for the Big Board's ads, Mr. Holland, like the
Philadelphia exchange's Mr. Giordano, says the Big Board is
"quite strident in their attacks. Personally, I think we're
all in this together."</p>
<p>Is the stately Big Board really strident? Mr. Torrenzano
of the Big Board says such a complaint must mean his
exchange's ads, designed by its longtime agency, WPP Group's
Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc. unit, are "very
powerful," as they should be.</p>
<p>The Big Board hasn't advertised on TV so far, says Mr.
Torrenzano, because it doesn't think the medium is worth the
money. But the exchange doesn't rule out TV ads in the
future.</p>
<p>Both the Big Board and Nasdaq campaigns will cost each
market millions of dollars. Neither will say exactly how
much. Meanwhile, the American Stock Exchange has just hired
the two-year-old agency Follis & Verdi to prepare what the
exchange calls a "high-gear" ad effort of its own.</p>
<p>The American exchange's message will be that it's the
"marketplace for the '90s," says exchange Chairman James R.
Jones, an ex-congressman who knows about swaying public
opinion. The Amex used to be a strong challenger for the Big
Board, but these days it relies on its strong niche in the
options market to maintain its status as a major exchange.</p>
<p>The Big Board and Nasdaq are eagerly awaiting what the
Follis & Verdi agency comes up with. The agency -- which used
to work for the Commodity Exchange and is responsible for the
current, powerful National Basketball Association ads about
child abuse -- isn't so sure that ads such as the Big Board's
and Nasdaq's are as good as they could be.</p>
<p>"CEOs are looking for service, visibility and market
quality," says Ellis Verdi, Follis & Verdi president. "I feel
strongly there are a few significant messages that need to be
made, and very few have been made and made effectively yet."</p>

<p>TV News at Supermarkets</p>
<p>Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network & Headline
News and Act Media Inc., as expected, entered into a
partnership to supply supermarkets with television newscasts
at checkout lines.</p>
<p>The advertiser-supported service, "The Checkout Channel,"
will be test marketed in 12 stores in six cities from August
through October. Representatives of Act Media, a unit of
Heritage Media, and Turner Broadcasting said the channel will
be available nationally in 5,000 supermarkets by the first
quarter of 1991.</p>
<p>The programming will be eight minutes in length with
two-and-a-half minutes of commercials. The supermarkets will
receive TV sets and satellite dishes and will share in the ad
revenue. The news can be updated every eight minutes.</p>

<p>Ad Note. . . .</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENT: Converse Inc., North Reading, Mass., named
Ingalls, Quinn & Johnson, Boston, to handle ads for its Evolo
by Converse women's performance shoe line. Billings are
estimated at $2 million. Ingalls Quinn is Converse's main
agency for its line of sneakers.</p>
