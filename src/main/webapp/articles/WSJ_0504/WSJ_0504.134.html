	<p class="article-leader">William F. Farah, who was removed as chairman of Farah
Inc. last week, sued the company, directors and top officers
to prevent them from cutting him off from the El Paso, Texas,
clothing manufacturer he helped manage for 53 years.
   Mr. Farah, a company director and the company's largest
stockholder with one million shares, or about a 15% stake, is
asking an El Paso county court for a temporary restraining
order to keep other board members and Farah's top management
from restricting his role as a board member and company
consultant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Farah charges that board members have threatened to
terminate his three-year consulting services contract. He
resigned as president and chief executive officer of the
company last year and was succeeded by Richard C. Allender.</p>
<p>In an interview conducted before the suit was filed, Mr.
Allender declined to discuss the company's relationship with
Mr. Farah. But when asked about Mr. Farah's pending lawsuit,
Mr. Allender said: "I can't afford to be concerned about what
Willie {Mr. Farah} may or may not do. I have a business to
run."</p>
