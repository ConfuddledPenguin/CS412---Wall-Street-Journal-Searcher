	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Ravaged by a slump in its computer business,
N.V. Philips reported an unexpected plunge in first-quarter
earnings, leading to a frantic sell-off of its shares.
   In trading in Amsterdam, the Dutch electronics giant's
shares plunged 11% to 33.60 guilders ($17.77) from 37.80
guilders ($20). That drop knocked 1.13 billion guilders
($597.9 million) off the company's market capitalization,
cutting its total value to 9.3 billion guilders ($4.92
billion).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Philips common fell 14.4% to close at $17.125, off $2.875 a
share, on volume of 1.5 million shares.</p>
<p>The results were described as disastrous by several
analysts and once again threw into question the company's
much-ballyhooed restructuring and its long-awaited recovery.
Many analysts say they question whether Philips can continue
to survive in its current sprawling structure, selling
everything from hair dryers and light bulbs to semiconductors
and medical equipment.</p>
<p>"Despite earlier statements, the company is not at all on
the right track," said Fabian Koning, a securities salesman
at Bank Mees & Hope in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Excluding extraordinary items, profit from operations
plummeted to just six million guilders ($3.2 million) from
223 million guilders ($118 million) a year earlier. But an
extraordinary gain of 330 million guilders lifted net income
to 336 million guilders from 223 million guilders. The
extraordinary gain came from the sale of part of Philips's
defense electronics operations to Thomson CSF of France.</p>
<p>Philips blamed its problems on high interest rates,
fluctuating exchange rates and a world-wide slump in computer
sales. But it said that continuing problems for the rest of
the year will make it "very difficult" to meet an earlier
forecast of an increase in operating profit from last year's
2.29 billion guilders.</p>
<p>"It's a world-wide malaise," said a Philips spokesman,
"It's not specifically a Philips problem."</p>
<p>In March, when Philips reported its annual results for
1989, it reiterated its forecast of an increase in 1990
operating profit and gave no indication of pending problems.
Philips said that the global spread of its operations makes
it difficult to predict the impact of currency fluctuations
and last-minute changes in consumer demand.</p>
<p>But investors have been hurt by such surprises by Philips
in the past. On Oct. 9, 1986, for example, the company's
stock fell 13% after a similar shock. Several analysts said
they are losing patience with the company's explanations of
such events.</p>
<p>"Visibility has been extremely poor," said Eleanor Buss,
an analyst at Robert Fleming Securities of London. "You would
think a company would know what effect currencies would have
on its results."</p>
<p>Philips, which reports its results in the strong Dutch
guilder, has been hurt by weakness in the yen, the dollar and
the pound, the principal currencies used by its competitors.
That means that it has been forced to charge higher prices
than its rivals. High inflation in Brazil and other parts of
Latin America also hurt profits in an important market for
items such as light bulbs and television sets.</p>
<p>But outsiders contend the problem goes beyond currency
fluctuations. "In general," said one Amsterdam analyst, "they
have been losing market share in very competitive markets."</p>
<p>This was especially true in the computer sector, in which
Philips is a major producer of terminal hardware and personal
computers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Philips said that operating profit rose
"substantially" in consumer products, which includes consumer
electronics, domestic appliances, musical recordings and
personal-care products. It didn't give any profit figures but
said sales in this sector rose more than 10%.</p>
<p>But even in traditional cash-generating parts of the
company, such as light bulbs and television-picture tubes,
analysts said that Philips is increasingly suffering from
lower margins and stronger competition.</p>
<p>Philips has been undergoing a wrenching restructuring
program, trying to focus on its leading products and to
reduce its work force.</p>
<p>During the past five years, Philips has closed more than
75 factories and has cut the number of its employees by more
than 40,000. And since Jan. 1, Philips has further reduced
its work force by 3,300 to about 300,000.</p>
<p>Most recently, Philips has confirmed that it's discussing
a possible cooperation pact with other computer makers,
including Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. Philips wants to
retain a foothold in the computer business to keep as wide a
presence as possible to benefit from its expertise from such
areas as high-definition television and in compact disks.</p>
<p>Management consultants and analysts said that yesterday's
poor results will force Philips to redouble its efforts to
find a compatible partner.</p>
<p>Few analysts advised investors to sell their shares at the
current depressed levels. One said he expects the share price
to stabilize at near the current level, mainly because of
takeover speculation. The company is currently valued at less
than half its net asset value and could be sold off for a
substantially higher price if it were broken up, he said.</p>
