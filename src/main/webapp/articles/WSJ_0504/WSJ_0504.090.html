	<p class="article-leader">Your March 26 page-one article "Global Reach: Cross-Border
Alliances Become Favorite Way to Crack New Markets" makes a
critical point: Strategic alliances will indeed be "a
hallmark of business in the 1990s." In fact, around the
world, the number of business alliances is at least doubling
annually. Yet alliances take a mind-set that is quite
different from what the article suggests.
   In two decades of planning, advising on, working in,
teaching about, and sometimes managing strategic alliances
around the world, I've never encountered a successful
alliance in which partners "shake hands with {their} right
hand, while making a fist with {their} left."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To be sure, each firm must protect its separate interests
by safeguarding core strengths such as critical know-how or
market-access channels, prized brand names or a key position
in the value-added chain.</p>
<p>But the implicit threat connoted by the image of "making a
fist" weakens an alliance because it damages mutual trust.</p>
<p>Even steadfast rivals can build successful alliances. A
key is first to segregate their areas of competition from
those of their mutual interest. One need only look at Ford
and Mazda, Apple and DEC, and GE and SNECMA, which compete
head-to-head for military customers while cooperating
intensely and successfully in the commercial market.</p>
