	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- H.F. Ahmanson & Co. said it reached a
definitive agreement to acquire Home Savings Bank of New York
in a stock swap valued at about $300 million.
   Under the agreement, Home of New York shareholders will
receive Ahmanson common stock with a market value equal to
about $25 a share for each of the 12 million Home of New York
shares outstanding, subject to adjustments. The $25 price is
about 1.2 times Home of New York's book value of $20.11 a
share, or on the lower end of what healthy thrifts have been
fetching recently. At a $25-a-share value, the transaction
would involve about 17 million shares of Ahmanson, which had
about 99.3 million shares outstanding at Dec. 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Home of
New York shares jumped $3.875 to $18.875 on volume of 830,800
shares. Ahmanson closed at $17.375, down 12.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Ahmanson said the merger would allow it to expand its
savings and mortgage lending operations in the New York area,
the company's second largest market after California. Under
the agreement, Ahmanson would combine Homes of New York with
its Bowery Savings Bank unit.</p>
<p>The proposed merger won't create major overlaps, Ahmanson
said, and branch closings aren't expected. Home of New York,
based in Bayside, Queens, has 13 offices, assets of $1.6
billion, and deposits of $1.15 billion. The Bowery has 26
branches and deposits of $5 billion. Ahmanson, parent of Home
Savings of America, the nation's largest thrift, has total
assets of about $44.6 billion.</p>
<p>Ahmanson said Home of New York had 1989 net income of
$19.1 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with profit of
$24.1 million, or $2 a share, in 1988. It said Home of New
York's return on assets, a key indicator of profitability,
was a robust 1.18% in 1989, and that its capital levels
substantially exceeded regulatory minimums.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and
approval of Home of New York shareholders. Ahmanson said it
expects the transaction to close by year-end.</p>
<p>Terms also call for Home of New York directors to become
directors of Bowery. Richard Kraemer, chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Home of New York, will become
chairman and chief executive officer of The Bowery, and an
executive vice president of Ahmanson. He will also become a
director of Ahmanson's Home Savings of America unit.</p>
<p>Ahmanson said the final share price in the transaction may
vary, depending on the average closing price of its common
for the 10 trading days prior to the day the last required
regulatory approval for the transaction is obtained. If
Ahmanson's average stock price is greater than or equal to
$24.64 a share, the market value of shares issued to Home of
New York shareholders will be $28 a share. If Ahmanson's
average stock price is less than, or equal to $16.92 a share,
Home of New York may decide it won't complete the
transaction.</p>
