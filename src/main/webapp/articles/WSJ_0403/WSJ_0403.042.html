	<p class="article-leader">SALT LAKE CITY -- "Cold fusion" researchers are beginning
to suspect that more than one kind of nuclear reaction may be
occurring in their controversial experiments.
   But while skeptical scientists call some of the latest
findings "interesting," they say the cold-fusion researchers
have yet to produce convincing evidence of any kind of
nuclear reactions at all in their experiments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thus stands the cold-fusion debate after a three-day
meeting to mark the first anniversary of a claim that a
simple table-top apparatus was producing more energy than it
was consuming, apparently by the fusion of hydrogen atoms at
room temperature. That announcement by British chemist Martin
Fleischmann and his University of Utah colleague, B. Stanley
Pons, implying the discovery of a new energy source, set off
a world-wide scientific furor that continues.</p>
<p>The conference focused on scientists who have continued to
do cold-fusion research and have come up with more or less
positive experimental results. Largely absent were the scores
of scientists whose attempts to reproduce the cold-fusion
experiments last year failed and who believe that Messrs.
Fleischmann and Pons were mistaken. The conference was
organized by the National Cold Fusion Institute set up at the
University of Utah last fall with $5 million appropriated by
the state legislature to exploit the cold-fusion discovery.</p>
<p>Reports from more than 40 different laboratories indicated
that a small but growing number of scientists believe they
are seeing entirely new phenomena in the cold-fusion
experiments. "There is a growing consensus that you can't
explain the phenomena by errors" in the experiments, declared
Ernest B. Yeager, member of a Case Western Reserve University
team that reported significant amounts of excess heat energy
and tritium, a triply heavy form of hydrogen, coming out of
cold-fusion devices.</p>
<p>"At least 25 laboratories throughout the world have
achieved positive results," said Edmund Storms of the Los
Alamos National Laboratory who recently reported detecting
tritium in cold-fusion experiments. "We can put aside the
question of whether it is a real phenomenon or not," Mr.
Storms said.</p>
<p>But John Huizenga, professor of chemistry and physics at
the University of Rochester, said he heard nothing during the
conference that would change the conclusions last November of
an ad hoc committee of scientists set up by the Department of
Energy to evaluate the cold-fusion experiments. Mr. Huizenga
was co-chairman of the now-disbanded committee, which
concluded that "the present evidence for the discovery of a
new nuclear process termed cold fusion isn't persuasive."</p>
<p>Most current cold-fusion experiments are more
sophisticated versions of the original Pons-Fleischmann
devices. A thin rod of palladium encircled by a coil of
platinum wire is immersed in "heavy" water in which the
hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium.
When an electric current is applied to the apparatus the
heavy water molecules begin to break up into deuterium and
oxygen atoms in a classical electrolysis-of-water process.
Many of the deuterium atoms liberated from the heavy water
are "soaked up" by the palladium rod.</p>
<p>A recent count found 16 laboratories have reported
measuring excess energy coming from a total of 40
electrolytic cells, David H. Worledge of the utility
industry's Electric Power Research Institute told the
conference. Five of the laboratories have claimed measuring
high levels of excess heat energy, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Worledge said he counted seven laboratories that have
reported finding tritium in 22 different cells, including
groups at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Texas A&M
University in the U.S. and the Bhabha Atomic Research Center
near Bombay, India. He also cited reports from at least three
laboratories of detecting neutrons coming in short-lived
bursts from cold-fusion experiments, albeit at extremely low
levels.</p>
<p>But even scientists who believe these measurements are
reliable said the reports make cold fusion even more baffling
than before. The number of tritium atoms being counted
indicated that fusion reactions can account for only about 5%
of the excess heat being measured, the researchers said.
Moreover, for every tritium atom produced there should be a
neutron, yet the number of tritium atoms outnumber the
neutrons being detected by as much as 100 million to one.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion were indications that the heat and
tritium mightn't be produced at the same time or by the same
reaction. Several scientists, including Mr. Fleischmann,
suggested that different "mechanisms" may be at work. "The
two processes {heat and tritium} seem to be caused by two
different events," Mr. Storms of Los Alamos said.</p>
<p>Cold-fusion advocate John Bockris of Texas A&M argued that
the tritium found in his experiments appeared to be coming
from nuclear reactions occurring on the surface of the
palladium rods, probably on microscopic pimples called
dendrites that seem to form on the palladium during an
experiment.</p>
<p>The heat, on the other hand, may be coming from some
reaction inside the palladium rods. Charles D. Scott of the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee said a cold-fusion
cell in his laboratory produced heat for as long as 200 hours
at a time at a level far greater than could be explained by
any chemical reactions. He also detected tritium as well as
neutrons and gamma radiation in the experiment.</p>
<p>During some of these heat-producing periods, the Oak Ridge
scientists siphoned out the heavy water and replaced it with
ordinary water composed of "light" hydrogen atoms and oxygen.
The heat production began to die down, indicating the heavy
deuterium atoms are necessary to whatever nuclear reaction is
going on. It took several hours, however, before the cell was
no longer producing excess power. This suggested that nuclear
reactions were still occurring among deuterium atoms trapped
inside the rod.</p>
<p>Critics at the conference remained skeptical. "I'm here
because I find it extremely interesting but I'm as skeptical
now as I was at the beginning if not more so," said Richard
Petrasso of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said
that the reports of neutrons could easily be the result of
faults in neutron detectors and the reports of tritium, even
if accurate, couldn't explain the claims of excess heat.</p>
<p>The cold-fusion researchers conceded their biggest problem
is that they still cannot turn their experiments on and off
at will. The experiments turn on at completely unpredictable
times and no one yet has figured out what triggers them.</p>
<p>Many scientists will remain skeptical "until we can give
them a recipe so they can reproduce {the experiments} in
their own labs on their own equipment," said Howard Menlove
of the Los Alamos laboratory. "I hope that it {the recipe}
will come within the next six to 12 months," he added.</p>
