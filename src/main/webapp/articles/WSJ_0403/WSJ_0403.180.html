	<p class="article-leader">PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Outlet Communications Inc., which
recently sold several broadcasting properties, said it is
considering the sale of the company, including its VHF
television stations here and in Columbus, Ohio.
   Outlet said it authorized its financial adviser, First
Boston Corp., to "explore strategic alternatives that will
maximize shareholder value," but that it isn't certain that
"any such transaction will occur."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Outlet Class A
shares closed at $21.25, up $2.</p>
<p>Outlet currently owns two VHF television stations which
are NBC network affiliates, WJAR-TV in Providence and WCMH-TV
in Columbus, Ohio. It recently sold two UHF television
stations and two radio stations to Chase Communications of
Hartford, Conn., for $120 million. Net proceeds were used to
satisfy the stations' $10 million in obligations and reduce
Outlet's $84 million bank debt, as well as increase its cash
balance, Outlet said.</p>
<p>Outlet added that it is also exploring the possibility of
buying up to $20 million of its notes, common stock or a
combination of both. Outlet said it is considering the
purchase because its bonds are trading "below face value."</p>
<p>Outlet, which reported 1989 net income of $15.9 million,
or $2.43 a share, said it authorized First Boston to contact
parties concerning the possible sale or merger of the
company.</p>
<p>The company's 1989 earnings include a $4.6 million
extraordinary credit. The company reported a loss of $21.8
million, or $3.32 a share, in 1988.</p>
<p>In February, a group that includes Gabelli & Co., a New
York-based investment concern, reported to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it holds a 7.7% in Outlet.</p>
