	<p class="article-leader">Alexander Cockburn's March 1 Viewpoint, "U.S.-Backed
Terrorism Won in Nicaragua, Not Democracy," pushes the "Blame
America First" syndrome to a new depth. Stating that Violeta
Chamorro's landslide victory is a result of the campesinos'
fear of the U.S. is not only absurd, it defies logic as well
as fact. In the past 10 years 400,000 Nicaraguans have voted
with their feet by leaving Daniel Ortega's workers' paradise.
Since it is highly doubtful that those emigres would have
voted en masse for the Sandinistas, Mrs. Chamorro's victory
is even more amazing. Mr. Cockburn also seems to have
forgotten that the Sandinistas outspent UNO by 3 to 1.
   I am certain Mr. Cockburn was initially stunned (along
with the party cadre, Sandinistas and the liberal
establishment of this country) at the size of the Chamorro
victory in light of pre-election polls. The Sandinistas
maintained a widespread informant network that operated on a
neighborhood level. With that in mind, why would the
electorate tell a Sandinista-sponsored pollster its true
feelings? Obviously fearful of honesty (with potential
negative repercussions), the people took the only sensible
course in answering a presidential-preference question. They
lied.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Cockburn too easily dismisses the wisdom of the
majority of Nicaraguan voters. They have joined Eastern
Europe and Lithuania in their open expression of contempt for
oppression, mindless propaganda and economic destruction of
their land by Marxist regimes.</p>

<p>Mr. Cockburn tries to ridicule the already historic speech
of Czech President Vaclav Havel to Congress "as a way of
coaxing money from Congress for his country" -- completely
disregarding the fact that Czechoslovakia is the only country
recently liberated from communism that asked for no money at
all from the U.S. In an attempt to debase Mr. Havel further,
he chooses "my side suffered more than yours" tactics by
counting the people killed in El Salvador, Guatemala and
Nicaragua. On his morbid abacus he proved that "the Eastern
Europe under Soviet domination was benign indeed." Probably
he realized the need for more sophisticated computers to
handle the murdered millions by Stalin in U.S.S.R. alone.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mr. Havel states that wherever an innocent
person is killed it is a tragedy for the whole of mankind. In
his words: ". . . the salvation of this human world lies
nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to
reflect, in human meekness and in human responsibility."</p>
<p>I would sincerely recommend to Mr. Cockburn that he study
the writings of this Czechoslovakian president, philosopher
and playwright. They were written during the dark ages of
Eastern Europe, sometimes while the author was in jail, but
they never contained anger or vengeance against the
oppressors as human beings. What Mr. Havel was fighting
against was the dehumanizing philosophy of our time; the
results of the Czechoslovakian "velvet revolution" is a proof
that this way of fighting is successful.</p>

<p>In his cynical critique of Mr. Havel's address to
Congress, Mr. Cockburn piously mentions "the terrible death
toll in Hungary in 1956," but the only East European figure
he gives to contrast with the large figures for Central
America is 92 dead from the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
in 1968. Estimates of "the terrible death toll in Hungary in
1956" range from 6,500 up to 32,000; about 190,000 Hungarians
fled their country. The Hungarian revolt lasted less than a
month; those Soviets, they don't fool around.</p>

<p>Only Alexander Cockburn could be so outrageous as to
contend that the stunning defeat of his beloved Sandinistas
in Nicaragua, in an election so closely monitored it was
impossible to fix, was a capitulation to U.S.-sponsored
terrorism rather than a thrilling example of democracy
working precisely as intended.</p>
