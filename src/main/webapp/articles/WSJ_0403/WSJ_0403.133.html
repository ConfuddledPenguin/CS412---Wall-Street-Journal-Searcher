	<p class="article-leader">Great Western Financial Corp. said its main unit's
previously reported agreement to buy branches of CenTrust
Savings Bank for $150 million fell through.
   Great Western said the agreement, reached last summer,
included clauses that allowed either side to kill the deal if
it hadn't been concluded by March 31. It said it allowed the
agreement to lapse.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The collapse of the deal came as no surprise and had been
foreordained by CenTrust's recent seizure by the government.
CenTrust, hurt by huge junk-bond losses and by the
free-spending ways of its controversial former chairman,
David L. Paul, failed last month. Officials have estimated
that its demise may ultimately cost the government $2 billion
to $3 billion.</p>
<p>Under the proposed transaction, Great Western was to have
bought the deposits, offices and related assets of 63
branches of Miami-based CenTrust, which by the time the
agreement was announced already was the focus of increasing
regulatory concern. Great Western has headquarters in Beverly
Hills, Calif.</p>
