	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. said it expanded
its PrimeTime calling plan to start at 5 p.m., rather than 7
p.m. weekdays.
   The change follows adjustments in American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.'s Reach Out America plan that include a 15%
discount off standard evening rates between 5 p.m. and 10
p.m.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MCI's PrimeTime plan, introduced last May, offers
customers an hour of out-of-state calling within the U.S. for
$8 a month, provided that the calls are made between 5 p.m.
and 8 a.m. weekdays, and on Saturdays and Sundays. Additional
calls during those hours are billed at the rate of $6.50 an
hour.</p>
