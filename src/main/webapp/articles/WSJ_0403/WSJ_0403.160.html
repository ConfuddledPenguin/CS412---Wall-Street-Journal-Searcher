	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Several important House lawmakers agreed on
an approach to regulating cancer-causing industrial emissions
that would be more stringent than President Bush's clean-air
proposal.
   Under the approach, backed by Chairman John Dingell of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee; Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,
Calif.), chairman of the panel's health subcommittee; and New
York Rep. Norman Lent, the ranking GOP member of the panel,
factories that emit such pollutants would have to install the
best available technology for reducing emissions. All sources
of cancer-causing pollution would have to be regulated within
10 years, except for those that pose a cancer risk to nearby
residents of less than one in one million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Environmental Protection Agency would study whether
any cancer risk remains after this technology is applied. It
would then establish standards that provide an "ample margin
of safety."</p>
<p>The plan could be voted on in committee as early as today.</p>
<p>Under the president's proposal, 50% of all sources of
toxic pollution would be regulated within 10 years.
Additional, deeper cutbacks could be required on a
case-by-case basis if EPA, taking cost and health into
account, finds a plant's fumes still pose "unreasonable"
risks.</p>
<p>The Senate plan would aim to protect an individual with
slightly above-average exposure and would set a cancer-risk
standard of one in 10,000. This provision is part of the
clean-air bill that the Senate is expected to approve
tonight.</p>
