	<p class="article-leader">Suffield Financial Corp. said it expects to report a $3
million loss for the first quarter. The Suffield, Conn., bank
holding company added that it expects to increase its loan
loss reserves by $3.5 million to $4 million to a total of
about $12 million.
   Citing "the continued general deterioration of the New
England real estate market," the company said the level of
nonperforming loans at both its Coastal Bancorp, in Portland,
Maine, and at Suffield Bank has increased since Dec. 31.</p>
