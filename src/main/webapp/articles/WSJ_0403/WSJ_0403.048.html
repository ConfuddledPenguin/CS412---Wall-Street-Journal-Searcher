	<p class="article-leader">Xerox Corp. said its president, Paul Allaire, will succeed
David Kearns as chief executive officer Aug. 1 with Mr.
Kearns remaining as chairman.
   At the same time, Xerox said Vice Chairman Melvin Howard,
who heads Xerox Financial Services, will retire May 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Mr. Allaire's succession had been expected since
1986 when he was named president and heir apparent, the
retirement of the 55-year-old Mr. Howard came as a surprise.
Analysts interpreted both moves as signaling the company's
satisfaction with its recent emphasis on its core business
equipment operations and growing disillusionment with
financial services. Several analysts suggested Xerox
Financial Services is now ripe for piecemeal selling, a move
long favored by Wall Street.</p>
<p>After years of missteps and disappointments, Xerox, based
in Stamford, Conn., has been performing relatively well
lately, especially in copiers, printers and other
document-processing equipment. It posted a $212 million
profit on revenue of $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of
1989, compared with a $77 million loss on revenue of $4.4
billion in the year-earlier period. The 1988 fourth quarter
results included a one-time restructuring charge of $244
million.</p>
<p>But dismal results in the financial-services sector have
masked this progress, and the firm has been troubled by its
investments in VMS Realty Partners, a Chicago real estate
concern being rocked by lawsuits and liquidity problems.</p>
<p>Though he was considered a long-shot candidate for the
chief executive's post, Mr. Howard didn't decide to retire
because he was passed over, a company spokesman said. Nor did
his retirement have anything to do with the VMS Realty
imbroglio, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Mr. Howard, who was unavailable for comment, will be
succeeded as head of Xerox Financial Services by Stewart
Ross, the company's senior vice president and chief financial
officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Allaire, 51, has been strongly associated with Xerox's
recent successes, and has distanced himself from its
failures. A 24-year Xerox veteran, he made his name during
two stints at Rank Xerox, the company's London-based
marketing and services subsidiary. Faced with strong Japanese
rivals, he used a hands-on approach to cut costs by $200
million and re-establish the company's competitiveness. By
1980, he had risen to Rank Xerox's top position, managing
director.</p>
<p>In 1983, Mr. Allaire returned to the U.S. as senior vice
president and chief staff officer. He was elected president,
traditionally a waiting room for CEOs-to-be, three years
later, and since then has overseen the company's business
equipment operation.</p>
<p>Over the past year or so, this operation has re-emerged as
Xerox's core strategic business, providing a boost for Mr.
Allaire. Meanwhile, the company's move to financial services,
promoted by Mr. Kearns in the early 1980s as an antidote to
Xerox's then-declining market share in copiers, has seemed
destined for an ever-decreasing role.</p>
<p>"They got into that business when their backs were against
the wall," said Alex Henderson, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "There's no strategic value
in it any more."</p>
<p>By stepping aside as chief executive but staying as
chairman, Mr. Kearns follows a tradition established by Xerox
founder Joseph Wilson: At age 60, top officers relinquish
day-to-day responsibilities and make way for their
successors. Mr. Kearns will be 60 on Aug. 11.</p>
<p>The Xerox spokesman said Mr. Kearns intends to stay
involved in the company, albeit much more on an advisory
basis than previously. Many Xerox watchers speculated that
Mr. Kearns will eventually find his way to a high government
post, perhaps secretary of education. He currently serves on
the President's Education Policy Advisory Committee, and has
written a book on reforming the U.S. public school system.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Xerox closed at $55.375, down 25 cents.</p>
