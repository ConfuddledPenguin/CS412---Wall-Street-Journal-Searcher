	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- Will Bill Cosby throw out the first ball?
   Tom Werner, who with partner Marcy Carsey owns and
produces TV shows including "The Bill Cosby Show" and
"Roseanne," has agreed with nine partners to buy the San
Diego Padres baseball team for about $75 million from
McDonald's Corp. heiress Joan Kroc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 39-year-old Mr. Werner, a beneficiary of a hefty chunk
of the some $500 million that "Cosby" netted in syndication,
will be chairman of a general partnership that includes
another Hollywood executive and eight San Diego businessmen.</p>
<p>Mr. Werner initially pursued the Padres with Russell
Goldsmith, chairman of Republic Pictures Corp., after Mrs.
Kroc put the team up for sale last year. In December they
informally teamed up with another suitor, an investor group
headed by former Coca-Cola Bottling of San Diego president,
Arthur Rivkin, and Arthur Engel, chairman of Southwest Marine
Inc., a ship repair concern.</p>
<p>The new group, which agreed to bid together in February,
had the advantage of what one partner called the "glue
factor," eight partners who were firmly rooted in the San
Diego community.</p>
<p>The purchase price was lower than some estimates, which
was that the team would fetch $100 million. Indianapolis
radio magnate Jeff Smulyan paid $81 million for the Seattle
Mariners last year, and the Padres have much higher
attendance -- the team drew more than two million last season
-- and a more successful team. But the buyers of the Padres
were able to argue that the Padres should command a lower
price for several reasons.</p>
<p>For one thing, the team has high operating expenses,
including eight players who make more than $1 million a year;
the Mariners have one of the lowest payrolls in the game.
Player salaries throughout baseball have been escalating so
rapidly that values of franchises may have come down in
recent months, despite the $13 million annually each team
will reap over the next four years as a result of new
national television contracts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike some franchises, San Diego's potential
for expanding its local television market has its limits. Its
media market ranks 24th of 26 teams: rather than serving an
entire region like some teams, the Padres are limited by the
Pacific Ocean to the west, the desert to the east, Mexico to
the south and Orange County and Los Angeles to the north,
where the Dodgers and Angels reign. Another factor, according
to a partner, is that Mr. Smulyan has the capability of
moving the team; the Padres have a 10-year lease at Jack
Murphy Stadium and aren't likely to relocate.</p>
