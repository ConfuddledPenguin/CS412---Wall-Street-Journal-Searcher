	<p class="article-leader">LITHUANIA SOFTENED its position on the Baltic republic's
secession bid.
   In an attempt to circumvent Gorbachev's weekend call to
rescind its declaration of independence, the breakaway
republic's lawmakers struck a conciliatory note by saying
Lithuania wants gradual independence from the Soviet Union.
They also renewed an invitation for talks with Moscow. There
wasn't any Kremlin response. As officials in Vilnius sought a
compromise to the dispute, about 1,000 people protested
Soviet occupation of the Lithuanian prosecutor's office.</p>

Western journalists from Lithuania and called on the Kremlin
to refrain from using force.</p>

<p>IRAQ THREATENED to attack Israel with sophisticated
chemical weapons.</p>
<p>President Hussein, in a radio broadcast from Baghdad, said
for the first time that Iraq has advanced nerve-gas weapons,
and he threatened to destroy "half of Israel" if it attacked
his country. Hussein also denied that Iraq has nuclear arms,
describing as "nonsense" accusations that Baghdad tried last
week to smuggle U.S.-made nuclear triggers through London. He
also faulted Western criticism of last month's hanging of a
British journalist on spying charges.</p>
<p>The U.S. denounced the Iraqi military threat against
Israel as "irresponsible and outrageous," saying the Mideast
was "already volatile enough."</p>

<p>DE KLERK SAID South Africa would tighten security to quell
violence.</p>
<p>Speaking to Parliament in Cape Town, the president said he
would send police and military reinforcements to Natal
province, where hundreds of people have been killed in black
factional fighting. De Klerk also said that he would meet
Thursday with black nationalist Mandela, and he proposed an
amnesty for politically motivated political acts. He also
criticized the African National Congress for withdrawing from
talks with Pretoria on a new constitution.</p>
<p>Mandela toured a Natal province township and called for an
end to the unrest that has blocked the fight against "the
forces of oppression."</p>

<p>The U.S. plans to open talks that could lead to Soviet
participation in manned space missions to the Moon and Mars.
Similar discussions are planned with Western allies. While
proponents say such a program could result in greater
superpower cooperation, critics contend that the U.S. risks
surrendering technology.</p>

<p>Iran-Contra jurors began deliberating in the case against
Poindexter after a federal judge in Washington directed them
to focus only on his guilt or innocence and to ignore the
"underlying political controversy" of the affair. The former
national security adviser is accused of conspiracy,
obstructing Congress and making false statements.</p>

<p>East Germany's Boehme resigned as leader of the Social
Democratic Party amid allegations that he had ties to the

or commitments" had been made over a Bundesbank plan to limit
the exchange of East German savings into West German marks.</p>

public disorder and other offenses.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court refused to allow California to carry out
its first execution in 23 years, letting stand an order

chamber. Harris, 37, kidnapped and murdered two San Diego
teen-agers in 1978 to use their car in a bank robbery.</p>

<p>Bush appealed to broadcasters to support U.S.-backed
television transmissions to Cuba, despite concern that Havana
may respond with widespread jamming of American domestic
signals. Cuba has been disrupting TV Marti signals from
Florida since the operation began last month.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is reiterating its call for cuts of 10% in
U.S. troops in the Pacific over three years. The move will

lawmakers are seeking deeper reductions.</p>
