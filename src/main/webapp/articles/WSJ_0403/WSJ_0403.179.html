	<p class="article-leader">TIMONIUM, Md. -- Kirschner Medical Corp. said it is
seeking to sell or spin off its troublesome Chick division,
which makes surgical lights and tables, allowing the company
to focus on its core orthopedic products.
   The company also announced the renegotiation of $35
million in bank debt. Under the new terms, the loans are
payable on demand and subject to review in 90 days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Kirschner said two stockholders filed suit
against the company and three officers and directors,
alleging that it deceived investors as to its financial
condition. Kirschner said it denies "any wrongdoing" and
intends to vigorously contest the suit, which was filed March
23 in U.S. District Court in Maryland.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Kirschner
shares fell $1.25 to close at $7.</p>
<p>The Chick business, which is more capital-intensive than
Kirschner's other lines, has been a "considerable drain" on
the company's profit, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The division also has been a source of patent and
business-agreement disputes with ALM Equipment Hospitaliers
S.A. of France. In January, Kirschner lost a patent
infringement lawsuit to ALM Equipment over Kirschner's Chick
II surgical light. A jury awarded $820,000 in damages to ALM.
Kirschner says it may appeal.</p>
<p>In a separate issue, last summer an arbitration panel
found that ALM had unfairly breached an agreement to supply
Kirschner with surgical lights and ordered ALM to pay
as-yet-unspecified damages.</p>
<p>Kirschner said it retained investment banker Alex. Brown &
Sons to assist it in developing strategies for Chick, which
contributed $13 million to Kirschner's total revenue of about
$68 million.</p>
<p>The company also said it expects to release fiscal 1989
results by the end of this week.</p>
