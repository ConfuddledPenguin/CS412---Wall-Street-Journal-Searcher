	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl rushed
to neutral ground after a Bundesbank proposal to strictly
limit the exchange of East German savings into West German
marks provoked warnings of social unrest in East Germany and
a round of criticism in Bonn.
   "No decisions or commitments whatsoever have been made,"
Mr. Kohl declared in a statement. The chancellor said the
Bundesbank recommendation would be studied carefully, but
stressed that preparatory talks were still under way.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I expressly acknowledge my responsibility for the people
of the DDR {East Germany}. I repeatedly underlined my pledge
to solidarity during the DDR election campaign, and I stand
by this," Mr. Kohl asserted. He reaffirmed plans to achieve a
currency union with East Germany this summer, but offered no
specific conversion rates. Talks on monetary union will
resume with the formation of a new East German government,
Mr. Kohl said.</p>
<p>The controversial Bundesbank plan would limit the 1-for-1
conversion rate for East Germany's 160 billion East German
marks in savings to 2,000 West German marks ($1,181.40) per
person. The central bank also stipulated that the remainder
of savings -- as well as wages, pensions and debt -- be
converted at a rate of one West German mark for two East
German marks. This would minimize strains on East German
industry and lessen the inflationary impact on West German
monetary policy, officials explained.</p>
<p>Chancellor Kohl had promised a 1-for-1 rate for savers
while campaigning for East German conservative candidates
last month. East German leaders say their electorate had
widely interpreted the assurance as meaning that all savings,
wages and pensions of the 16 million East Germans would be
converted at the more-favorable rate.</p>
<p>The discord over the knotty currency issue has complicated
Chancellor Kohl's hitherto mostly smooth progress toward
German unity, capped by the conservative victory in East
Germany's March 18 elections. Finance Minister Theo Waigel
has endorsed the Bundesbank's plan, but other senior Bonn
cabinet members were keeping their distance. Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in a radio interview yesterday
the Bundesbank recommendations "won't be the last word and
can't be the last word."</p>
<p>The Social Democratic opposition party in Bonn was quick
to exploit the dispute. Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD's candidate
for chancellor in West Germany's December elections, accused
Mr. Kohl of breaking a promise in what he called "voter
deception" after many East German voters chose a three-party
alliance led by the East German Christian Democratic Union on
the basis of Mr. Kohl's conversion promise.</p>
<p>East Germans officials fear that a dilution of East German
savings and incomes would impoverish normal wage earners.
They predicted demonstrations and a new wave of emigration if
the Bundesbank plan were adopted. East German union leaders
warned of imminent strikes by protesting workers unless a
clear signal was sent from Bonn.</p>
<p>East Germany's premier-designate, Lothar de Maiziere, said
yesterday his East German Christian Democrats are sticking to
its promise for a broad 1-for-1 exchange.</p>
<p>"We don't believe it possible that salaries, wages, and
pensions can be treated on a 1-for-2 basis," Mr. de Maiziere
said in East Berlin. He observed that average East German
wages already amount to only one-third of West German levels.</p>
<p>West German monetary officials worry that the vast gap in
West German and East German productivity levels could unleash
inflation.</p>
<p>Bonn already is expected to have to come up with as much
as 50 billion marks a year to rebuild East Germany's
crumbling infrastructure. And because Bonn would have to foot
the bill for any East German crisis -- such as mass
unemployment or a collapse of the social security system --
Mr. Kohl is seen walking a fine line between promises to the
East German electorate and the advice of his monetary
experts.</p>
