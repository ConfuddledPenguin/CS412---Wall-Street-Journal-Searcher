	<p class="article-leader">WOODBURY, N.Y. -- Cablevision Systems Corp. said it
entered a 10-year, $1.15 billion credit facility with a group
of banks jointly led by Citibank and Toronto Dominion Bank.
   The new facility represents a $250 million increase from
the parent company's existing facility and is expected to
close within 30 days, Cablevision said. A spokesman said the
cash would be used for working capital. He declined to
elaborate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts suggested the funds could be used to finance
Cablevision's plan to acquire Gateway Cable from Gilbert
Media Associates L.P. Announced last December, the $102.5
million transaction is expected to close next month and would
give Cablevision an additional 40,000 subscribers. The
company's affiliated systems currently have a 1.5
million-subscriber base.</p>
<p>The funds also might be put toward Cablevision's
involvement in the Sky Cable plan, announced early this year,
analysts said. Cablevision will spend $75 million over four
years in a joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Communications unit, and
General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit.</p>
