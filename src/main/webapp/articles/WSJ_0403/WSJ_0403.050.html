	<p class="article-leader">TOWSON, Md. -- Black & Decker Corp. said it concluded the
sale of its footwear-materials business to United Machinery
Group Ltd. of Britain for about $125 million.
   The divestiture is part of the power-tool company's
consolidation of Emhart Corp., acquired last May for $2.8
billion. Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down
acquisition debt, the company said.</p>
