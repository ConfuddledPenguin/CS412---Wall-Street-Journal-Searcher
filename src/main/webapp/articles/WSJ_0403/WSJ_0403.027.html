	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tandy Brands Inc. said it is
considering the possible spinoff of its Tandy Brands
Accessories unit as a new publicly traded company.
   The specialty retailer and maker of men's accessories and
neckwear said various regulatory and statutory matters must
be resolved before the spinoff plan is formally adopted. But
if approved, the company said, the plan would call for the
distribution of common stock in the new company to Tandy
Brands stockholders in a tax-free form.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to Tandy Brands Accessories, a manufacturer
and marketer of mens' and boys' leather accessories and
neckwear, the company also operates Bombay Co., a retailer of
specialty furniture and home accessories. The accessories
division accounts for about 25% of the Tandy Brands' revenues
with the Bombay division accounting for the rest, a company
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Carson R. Thompson, Tandy Brands chairman and chief
executive, said the spinoff would allow the management of
each company to adopt strategies and pursue objectives
appropriate to its specific business. Last year, Tandy Brands
hired an investment banker to explore the possibility of
selling the entire company, but called off the study after
several months.</p>
<p>For the six months ended Dec. 31, Tandy Brands reported
net income of $8.2 million, or $1.55 a share, on revenue of
$77.3 million. That was up from net income of $5.7 million,
or $1.43 a share, on revenue of $60.2 million for the same
period a year earlier. The latest six-month period included
$1.7 million in extraordinary tax benefits compared with $1.9
million in similar benefits recorded during the year-earlier
period.</p>
