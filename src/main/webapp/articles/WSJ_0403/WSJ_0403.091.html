	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- James M. Walsh, chairman of CS First Boston
Inc.'s Japan subsidiary, resigned, six weeks after the
company appointed another investment banker to run the
group's Asian operations.
   Neither Mr. Walsh nor CS First Boston would say if his
departure was connected to the appointment in February of
Allen Wheat as chief executive of CS First Boston Pacific
Inc. The appointment of Mr. Wheat, former chairman of Bankers
Trust Co.'s international arm, created a new layer of
management between Mr. Walsh and CS First Boston's executives
in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Walsh, contacted in Hawaii, said he decided to leave
CS First Boston after the firm asked him to move to London.
"I wanted to stay in Japan, so I pulled the ripcord," he
said. "The decision to leave was entirely my own choice."</p>
<p>He declined to discuss his resignation further.</p>
<p>A 14-year veteran of CS First Boston and its corporate
predecessor, First Boston Inc., Mr. Walsh was largely
responsible for building up the group in Japan. Since the
firm opened a branch here in 1985, its staff has swelled from
12 people to more than 400, with offices in Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
<p>CS First Boston is one of 22 foreign members of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, and also belongs to the Tokyo International
Financial Futures Exchange.</p>
