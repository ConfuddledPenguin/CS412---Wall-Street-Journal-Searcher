	<p class="article-leader">MAGAZINES: Texas Monthly will close Domain magazine, a
life style and home magazine, because of what the publisher
labeled restrictive postal regulations. This is the first
such move by a magazine publisher following a recent
announcement by the U.S. Postal Service that rates for second
and third class mail would be greatly increased in early
1991. Decreased spending by national advertisers in home
furnishings was another factor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>WHO'S NEWS: Ann Godoff returned to her job as vice
president and executive editor of Atlantic Monthly Press.
About a month ago, she quit to become executive editor of
Doubleday but said she decided she would rather work for a
small, independent publishing house. Doubleday, part of
Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc., which is owned
by Bertelsmann AG, said it hasn't found a successor to Ms.
Godoff. . . . Rich Szefc was named to the new post of senior
vice president and chief financial officer of Random House
Inc. He most recently was vice president and treasurer of
OmniCorp Holdings Inc., the U.S. arm of a Swiss investment
group. Random House is owned by the Newhouse family's Advance
Publications Inc. Some of his financial duties were
previously the responsibility of Joe Guadango, formerly vice
president of finance, who was named to the new post of vice
president of operations for Outlet Book Co., part of the
company's Crown Publishing Group.</p>
