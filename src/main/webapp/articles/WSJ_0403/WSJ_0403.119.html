	<p class="article-leader">Comerica Inc., Detroit, said it has entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire InBancshares, City of
Industry, Calif., for about $40 million.
   The merger will be the second in California for Comerica,
a bank holding company with $12 billion in assets.
InBancshares, a bank holding company with $242 million in
assets, has 70 employees at four office locations in City of
Industry, Encino, Santa Ana and San Francisco.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Comerica said the $40 million purchase price represents
$20.25 a share for InBancshares common stock. That "will
represent approximately two times book value and 10 times
expected 1991 earnings," Comerica added.</p>
<p>Comerica said the transaction, which requires regulatory
approval, should be completed in the first quarter of 1991.
That's the same timetable as Comerica's other California
acquisition of Plaza Commerce Bancorp, a San Jose bank
holding company with $485 million in assets. Jan. 1, 1991, is
the earliest date that a Michigan bank holding firm can
acquire a California institution, Comerica said.</p>
<p>Comerica has operated commercial lending offices in
California since 1983.</p>
