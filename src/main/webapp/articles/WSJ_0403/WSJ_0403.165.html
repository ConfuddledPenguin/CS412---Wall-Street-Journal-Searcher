	<p class="article-leader">Waste Management Inc. said it will gain majority control
of Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., in a $500 million
transaction that analysts called complementary to both
companies.
   The acquisition of the majority stake will provide Oak
Brook, Ill.-based Waste Management -- the nation's largest
collector of municipal garbage -- with enhanced technology
and waste-processing capabilities. Wheelabrator is a Hampton,
N.H.-based developer and operator of waste-to-energy
facilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under an accord announced yesterday, Waste Management will
increase its Wheelabrator holdings to 55% from the current
22% through an exchange of stock. The pact allows Waste
Management to name a majority of Wheelabrator directors.</p>
<p>Terms of the pact call for Wheelabrator shareholders --
other than Waste Management -- to exchange each of their
shares for 0.469 Waste Management share and 0.574
Wheelabrator share. Waste Management would issue about 15.2
million common shares, giving the transaction a value of
about $521.7 million at yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Wheelabrator shares jumped $1.50 to close at $35; Waste
Management shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $34.25.</p>
