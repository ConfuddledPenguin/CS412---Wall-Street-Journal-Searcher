	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Cowabunga]
   "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," the movie based on the
comic book and wildly successful animated TV series, grossed
approximately $25.4 million in its first weekend at the box
office, making it the largest non-summer, non-Thanksgiving
weekend opening of a movie ever, according to the trade
newspaper Daily Variety. That shattered the previous record
set by "The Hunt for Red October," which grossed $17.2
million its first weekend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The movie is only the latest success for the four turtles
who, as the story goes, were deposited into a manhole, doused
with radioactive goo and grew to human-sized superheroes with
such expressions as "Surf's up]" "Cowabunga]" and "Let's
party, dude."</p>
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are already an industry unto
themselves. Last year, for instance, the Turtles earned more
than $350 million in license fees and merchandising, double
the 1988 earnings. This year, that figure will be "at least,
easily doubled," says Jim Prindle, director of licensing and
merchandising at Mirage Studios, a Northampton, Mass.-based
partnership of the comic's creators, Peter Laird, 36 years
old, and Kevin Eastman, 27. Messrs. Laird and Eastman
couldn't be reached yesterday.</p>
<p>More than 100 manufacturers hold licensing agreements to
put the creatures on everything from Burger King posters to
McCain Ellio's Foods Inc. frozen pizzas. They also appear as
action-figure toys and on T-shirts.</p>
<p>The success of the movie is also buoying the fortunes of
New Line Cinema Corp., the film's domestic distributor, whose
other projects include another mutant of sorts, Freddy
Kreuger of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series. "We have to
have the nostrils for smelling the good stuff," says Robert
Shaye, New Line's president. New Line is also benefiting from
the recently released film, "House Party," which the company
produced for $2.5 million and which so far has grossed $16.4
million. New Line Cinema's shares rose 37.5 cents to $11.25
yesterday in composite trading on the American Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," which cost about $12
million to make, was financed and produced by Golden Harvest
Films, a unit of Golden Communications Co. Ltd., based in
Hong Kong. Dennis McAlpine, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.,
figures Golden Harvest stands to clear about $18 million from
its share of domestic revenue of the film if the movie
grosses $100 million, and the company also has foreign
distribution rights. New York-based New Line bought the
domestic theatrical rights for about $3 million.</p>
<p>The movie -- which received mixed reviews -- is only the
latest vehicle for the Turtles, who are named after four
Renaissance artists: Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and
Donatello. There will, of course, be a sequel. In September,
a live stage show will make its debut at New York's Radio
City Music Hall. And recently, Burger King began selling
videotapes of episodes of the TV show "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles."</p>
<p>These tapes, distributed by Family Home Entertainment, a
subsidiary of Live Entertainment Inc., contain a 2 1/2-minute
commercial promoting various Turtle merchandise, including
the movie. Family Home distributes other tapes of the TV show
in the home-video marketplace and said it has sold over three
million of the videotapes. Live Entertainment also bought the
domestic home-video rights to the movie for about $5 million.
Live Entertainment's stock jumped $2.50 to $19.25 in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
<p>Just what is it that makes four talking turtles so
appealing?</p>
<p>"They have a sense of humor," says Mark Freedman,
licensing agent for the creatures and president of Surge
Licensing Inc., a company based on Long Island in New York.
"They're like the Bruce Willis character in `Moonlighting.'
They talk directly to the audience, and they don't take
themselves too seriously."</p>
<p>Four years ago, Mr. Freedman was a "marketing consultant"
when he says he happened upon the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles -- then simply comic book characters. He approached
Messrs. Laird and Eastman about a marketing deal. "The toy
industry was looking for a breakthrough item and I had a
feeling this would be it," Mr. Freedman says.</p>
<p>Another draw, says Mr. Freedman, 35, is that "parents
don't get it."</p>
<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created in 1983 for
a black-and-white comic book. According to Cheryl Prindle,
executive director at Mirage Studios, there are 28 volumes
and over four million copies of the comic books in print.</p>
<p>Some of Mr. Laird's other illustrations were published in
a small comic book titled "Scat" when Mr. Eastman, an amateur
cartoonist then working as a short-order cook, noticed a copy
of the comic book left on a Northampton bus.</p>
<p>Mr. Eastman took samples of his work to "Scat," whose
editor suggested he team up with Mr. Laird. "It was instant
friendship," Ms. Prindle says. It was Mr. Eastman whose
brainchild was the large turtle donning a ninja mask and
weapon, which he called "Ninja Turtles." Mr. Laird came up
with the full name.</p>
<p>The TV series is responsible for the playful jargon as
well as a song that calls the turtles "heroes on the
half-shell."</p>
<p>The movie, complete with the turtles tossing into the air
their favorite food, pizza, and slicing it with their katana
sword blades, features the work of Jim Henson's Creature
Shop, based in London.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Freedman, "I knew this would either bomb or be
the biggest hit."</p>
