	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
expelled Westmont Securities Corp. of Los Angeles and barred
a principal of the firm from association with any NASD member
for what the regulator called unfair pricing of securities.
   The disciplinary action was one of many announced by the
NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the over-the-counter
markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The firm and the principal, Azar Aslam Kahn of Northridge,
Calif., also were fined a total of $665,025. The NASD said
Westmont sold securities "at prices that were unfair in
relation to the prevailing market." Markups ranged from 5.44%
to 200%, the NASD said.</p>
<p>The firm also failed to maintain minimum net capital and
committed other securities-rule violations, the NASD charged.</p>
<p>North Coast Securities was expelled, and Michael J.
Olnick, a principal, was barred. The NASD alleged that the
firm and Mr. Olnick, both of Woodhaven, N.Y., didn't prepare
a monthly balance sheet and net-capital computations for
several months and failed to respond to agency requests for
information.</p>
<p>South Richmond Securities Inc. of New York and two
principals agreed to a total $150,000 fine to settle NASD
excessive-markup charges against them without admitting or
denying wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The firm also was suspended from effecting principal
transactions for retail customers for five days. The
principals, Barbara Hosman of Deer Park, N.Y., and Herman R.
Garcia Jr. of Staten Island, each was suspended for 30 days
and required to requalify as principals by exam.</p>
<p>The firm and principals consented to findings that they,
among other things, sold securities of an affiliate to
customers at markups ranging from 92% to 140% over the
prevailing market price.</p>
<p>Tejas Securities Inc. was suspended for 30 days and fined
$10,000. The NASD charged that the Houston firm failed to
employ a financial and operations principal, failed to carry
a blanket fidelity bond, and violated other securities rules.</p>
<p>Brook Investments Inc. of Chicago and Peter W.
Schellenbach, a Glencoe, Ill., principal, were fined a total
of $50,000. Mr. Schellenbach was suspended for 60 days,
barred as a principal, supervisor or manager, and prohibited
from maintaining a proprietary interest in any NASD member
that isn't publicly traded.</p>
<p>The NASD charged among other things that Mr. Schellenbach
tried to "give the illusion" that the firm was complying with
net-capital requirements by buying and reselling accounts
receivable of Brook at the end of a month.</p>
<p>Mr. Schellenbach has appealed the decision to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Black & Co. of Portland, Ore., was fined $5,000; Arthur
Joseph Lewis, a Beaverton representative, was fined $25,000
and suspended for a year; and the firm and two Portland
principals, Eugene Philip Goodrich and Dennis Burton Reiter,
were fined a total $15,000.</p>
<p>The sanctions were based on findings that Mr. Lewis
recommended that a customer buy and sell securities, although
the broker didn't have reasonable grounds to believe that the
recommendations were suitable. The NASD charged that the
firm, through Messrs. Reiter and Goodrich, failed to properly
supervise Mr. Lewis, among other things.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis has appealed the decision to the SEC.</p>
<p>The following individuals were barred by the NASD. Fines
are indicated:</p>
<p>John Dumas Karras, San Diego, $257,000; Trace Edward
Paradise, Arlington, Texas, $100,000; Donato Anthony
Minicozzi, Summit, N.J., $60,000; Bruce H. Gilbertson,
Whitehall, Pa., $50,000; George J. Wasson of Minneapolis,
$25,000 and, separately, an additional $12,500; Ronnie Anne
Martin, Pomona, N.Y., $30,000; Scott F. Casaccio of
Plainview, N.Y., $25,000, and Glen Vincent Benussi, Astoria,
N.Y., $17,000.</p>
<p>Also, Mitchel J. Anderson of Minneapolis; Joseph W. Casey
Jr. of Hoover, Ala.; Arrel W. Dietrich of Novi, Mich.; John
Joseph Harrington of Westlake Village, Calif.; William
Preston King II of New York; Lilli A. Meaux of Memphis; Sam
Meo of Brentwood, N.Y.; Norman G. Parker of Birmingham, Ala.;
and Robert Walter Rada of Colorado Springs, Colo., $15,000
each.</p>
<p>And Ronald D. Bonds, Byhalia, Miss., $10,000; Brian G.
Allen of Silver Spring, Md.; Scott Franzen of Chanhassen,
Minn.; Thomas J. Morrell of Franklinville, N.J.; and Donald
L. Stevenson of Evergreen Park, Ill., $5,000 each; and
Lawrence Kobert of Flanders, N.J., $1,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen has appealed the decision to the SEC.</p>
<p>Robert Herman Schumann of Sabetha, Kans., was barred and
fined $5,000, but he didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Other disciplinary suspensions and fines include: Brenden
James King of Scotch Plains, N.J., six months and $15,000;
David L. Newell of Mobile, Ala., six months and $10,000; and
Charles Gary Varesano of Clifton, N.J., 15 business days and
$6,000.</p>
<p>The following neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing:
Joseph Anthony Friscia of New York, two years as a principal
and $10,000; Frank John Ruggieri Jr. of Little Neck, N.Y.,
two years as a financial and operations principal and
$10,000; Reece D. Rogers, Memphis, Tenn., two years and
$2,000; and Robert Douglas Therell of Matthews, N.C.,
$20,000.</p>
<p>Except as noted below, the firms and individuals in-
volved in NASD disciplinary actions couldn't be reached for
comment:</p>
<p>Speaking for South Richmond Securities, Martin H. Kaplan
of the Manhattan law firm Gusrae, Kaplan & Bruno said, "The
intended charges that were never brought by the NASD were
settled to avoid the cost of extended litigation with the
NASD. South Richmond never admitted that there were markups
in any way resembling" those the NASD alleged. "Absolute
numbers lie absolutely, and reasonable men can differ as to
their construction."</p>
<p>At Black & Co., Mr. Reiter declined to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Therrell said that "no customer lost money or was
harmed in any way, nor even complained to the NASD or anyone
else. The charges stem from a paper-work mixup that occurred
years ago, when I was changing my registration from a
national firm to a local one. . . . I believe I had a solid
defense to the NASD's rather technical allegations.
Nonetheless . . . I decided to settle the case in order to
avoid the time and expense" of litigation.</p>
