	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- It took Daimler-Benz AG five years and billions of
Deutsche marks of investments to mold itself into one of the
world's leading defense companies.
   Then history intervened.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Early last November, just as the company was wrapping up
its tortuous negotiations to acquire the state-owned
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. aerospace and defense
group, the Berlin Wall began breaking apart. Communist
regimes in Eastern Europe were swept away by pro-democracy
movements, and the threat of war in Central Europe
evaporated. By year's end, West Germans were clamoring for a
"peace dividend" of their own.</p>
<p>The Bonn government, after playing midwife to the
Daimler-MBB merger, is now considering deep cuts in its
defense budget to help finance the staggering costs of
rebuilding East Germany. Entire arms projects -- including
the controversial 60 billion mark ($35 billion) Eurofighter
project, in which MBB plays a key role -- are now on thin
ice.</p>
<p>The rush of events caught Daimler off balance. A maker of
everything from missiles to toasters, the company was
counting on lucrative defense contracts to bankroll its
ambitious growth strategy. The expansion, launched in the
mid-1980s, was designed to create a global technology
conglomerate and to reduce Daimler's dependence on the
automotive business.</p>
<p>As Daimler hurriedly refocuses its strategy away from
defense, many of the basic objectives remain the same. In one
new area of emphasis, the group is seeking powerful alliances
in commercial aerospace and technology with established
players in the U.S. and Japan. Meanwhile, its prestigious
Mercedes cars and trucks will play a larger role than ever in
maintaining sales and profits.</p>
<p>"Daimler was thrown a curve ball by developments in
Eastern Europe and their impact on MBB's main sales source,
defense," says Stephen Reitman, an analyst for UBS-Phillips &
Drew in London. "Now they are scrambling for other sources of
income and turnover. You can't fault the strategy, but they
need partners to do it."</p>
<p>Daimler stirred up a small storm last month when it
announced that it was in the initial stages of forging a
loose "technological alliance" with Japan's Mitsubishi
industrial group. It set tongues wagging again last week by
announcing a much more specific move to merge its jet-engine
line with that of Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of United
Technologies Corp.</p>
<p>Daimler appears to be set on going wherever necessary to
get the partners -- and technology -- it needs for market
access. "These linkups suggest Daimler-Benz is getting a step
up the ladder in these new growth areas by joining forces
with other people's technology," says Simon Miller, an
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in London. In return,
he says, the partners get access to Europe, with the Daimler
name behind them.</p>
<p>With MBB, Daimler already controls more than 60% of West
Germany's aeronautics technology. But the West German
conglomerate's units are relatively small compared with
either British Aerospace PLC or France's Aerospatiale, making
the need for global partners more urgent.</p>
<p>Daimler's link with Pratt & Whitney, for instance, is
likely to give it a quick boost into the front rank of global
jet-engine producers. The two companies also are hinting that
the relationship could expand to other United Technologies
divisions, perhaps involving the joint manufacture of
turbochargers.</p>
<p>The Mitsubishi and United Technologies ventures also
illustrate an aspect of Daimler's strategy that distinguishes
it from many of its European counterparts. While many
Europeans, particularly the French, tend to focus on forging
links with other companies inside the European Community,
Daimler takes a world view.</p>
<p>"We have now reached a stage where, instead of a project
here and a project there, we wanted a partnership with more
permanency," says Juergen Schrempp, chairman of Deutsche
Aerospace AG, Daimler's aerospace unit, and a member of
Daimler's management board.</p>
<p>Mr. Schrempp says Daimler is talking about "a number of
concrete projects" with Mitsubishi, including a proposal for
joint development of a 75-seat airliner.</p>
<p>Besides the draw away from defense, analysts say
"risk-sharing partnerships" have become the order of the day
in civil aviation. Even by pooling Daimler's vast
technological resources in the aerospace field -- which
include not only MBB and Motoren & Turbinen Union G.m.b.H.
but also the Dornier G.m.b.H. aerospace concern -- the
company would be hard pressed to launch a fully independent
venture. And management is against trying to go it alone.</p>
<p>Against this background, Daimler is still struggling to
reshape itself into an effective conglomerate. It is often
accused of trailing its smaller and more creative
competitors. Critics grumble that the company may be adapting
too quickly to its special position as the nation's favored
defense contractor -- and not making the strides necessary to
break away from the trough of government subsidies.</p>
<p>MBB was added to a rapid succession of technology and
aerospace acquisitions in 1985, when AEG AG, MTU and Dornier
were taken aboard. The process catapulted Daimler into the
role of West Germany's No. 1 company by sales. But management
has conceded that, since then, the hoped-for synergies
between its automotive business and the technology additions
have been slow in coming. Analysts estimate that in 1989, for
instance, Daimler's nonautomotive business accounted for more
than a third of sales but only a tenth of profits.</p>
<p>Daimler Chairman Edzard Reuter unveiled his solution in
1988. He broke up the group into three largely autonomous
operations with their own management boards: Mercedes-Benz AG
for autos and trucks; Deutsche Aerospace for aerospace and
defense; and AEG for electronics.</p>
<p>Philippe Haspeslagh, a business professor at Insead, the
European management school in Paris, says Daimler has
successfully structured its many acquisitions. "But the next
step -- the strategic step of reorienting these new
businesses to survive in the global market -- is very
different, and much more difficult," he says.</p>
<p>The possible loss of defense contracts won't make the
transition any easier. After the inclusion of MBB, defense
technology accounts for just under half of Deutsche
Aerospace's sales. Among other projects, MBB accounts for 33%
of the four-nation Eurofighter project, designed to phase out
the Tornado as Europe's next generation of jet fighter. AEG
and MTU, for their part, are major contractors in the Tornado
project, as well as in other defense programs. In recent
weeks, Bonn Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has been
facing growing political pressure to shelve the Eurofighter
after its development stage.</p>
<p>For all of Daimler's worries, Bonn couldn't be happier.
The government braved antitrust protests when pushing through
the sale of MBB to Daimler-Benz late last year, laying the
cornerstone for the badly needed restructuring of West
Germany's scattered aerospace industry. Without the sale,
Bonn officials say, the proposed ventures with Mitsubishi and
United Technologies might never have come about, and an
important growth market would have been lost.</p>
<p>"Daimler's coordination with America and Japan continues
to improve the value and dimension of the German aerospace
industry," says a defense ministry official. He adds, "It
proves that the Daimler-MBB merger was the right decision."</p>
<p>Still, antitrust officials in both West Germany and the EC
say they are watching Daimler's activities closely. "Bigness
alone is not a problem," says an EC spokesman, adding that
the important thing is "how a company behaves once it
acquires this sort of position in a national -- and
ultimately the international -- market."</p>
