	<p class="article-leader">Torchmark Corp., blocked in a course it set only a week
ago, dropped its $50-a-share, or $6.3 billion, unsolicited
bid for rival American General Corp. and proposed its own
slate of five nominees for American General's board.
   The move by the Birmingham, Ala., insurer, coupled with
battles already emerging in court and in insurance
regulators' offices, indicated that the fight for control of
American General could be a long and messy affair, industry
observers said. "This thing is a legal morass," said one
takeover-stock trader.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Torchmark said it was withdrawing its offer because it
hadn't received any response from American General in the
48hour period set by Torchmark when it first made its bid in
a March 26 letter.</p>
<p>Torchmark "had a proposal on the table, and {American
General} wouldn't even look at it," said Jon W. Rotenstreich,
Torchmark president. "We're telling the shareholders that we
will go back to the table with a different board. One with a
resolution to do what's best for {shareholders}."</p>
<p>Torchmark said it will propose its own slate of five
independent board nominees at American General's May 2 annual
meeting. Torchmark said it will also propose a resolution for
the board to appoint a committee of independent directors "to
evaluate all acquisition proposals and hire an investment
banking firm to solicit offers to acquire the company."</p>
<p>American General, however, accused Torchmark of not acting
in good faith. Torchmark's latest move, said Harold S. Hook,
chairman and chief executive officer of American General,
"forces us to conclude that Torchmark didn't make its
acquisition proposal in good faith to begin with; that the
proposal was made and then withdrawn solely to provide an
excuse for a proxy fight." Mr. Hook added that American
General did respond within the 48hour period by scheduling to
consider the proposal at its next regularly scheduled board
meeting.</p>
<p>The Houston-based insurer repeated its earlier statement
that Torchmark's proposal hadn't been received by the 60-day
deadline for nominating directors, according to its bylaws.
American General said it also plans to "vigorously pursue" a
lawsuit, filed last week, seeking a declaratory judgment
upholding the bylaw provision.</p>
<p>American General's board made a resolution in February to
increase the size of its board to 15 directors from 13 at the
May 2 meeting. Six seats are up for election at the meeting.
Torchmark said yesterday that it had nominated only five
nominees in order to facilitate the re-election of Mr. Hook
to the board.</p>
<p>News of the companies' moves further battered American
General's stock, which hit a high of $40.125 a share last
week, when Torchmark's offer was disclosed. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, American General closed
at $36.75, down $1.875, while Torchmark closed at $45.50,
down 25 cents.</p>
<p>Beyond the battle over bylaws and deadlines,
takeover-stock traders said Torchmark faces another hurdle.
According to Texas law, any change of control of a Texas
insurance company must first be approved by the state
insurance commissioner. And a spokesman for the Texas State
Board of Insurance said that the staff of the board's
holding-company section is taking the position that the
commissioner must approve the change "before proxies are
solicited."</p>
<p>The approval process in Texas is quite cumbersome. First,
a potential acquirer must submit a detailed application to
the state insurance commissioner, outlining its plans for the
new entity. Within 30 days of receiving a complete
application, the commissioner must schedule a public hearing,
after which he makes his decision. A spokesman for the Texas
State Board of Insurance said Torchmark hasn't even submitted
an application yet.</p>
<p>Torchmark may still have an out or two. For starters, the
staff director who made the decision about the proxy fight
has asked the legal department for a second opinion. But
chances of a reversal don't look good. The insurance board
ruled that B.A.T Industries PLC would have to get the Texas
commissioner's approval before seeking proxies in its battle
for Farmers Insurance.</p>
<p>Second, Torchmark, according to some traders, apparently
will argue that because it is nominating an independent slate
of directors, the proxy fight doesn't constitute an attempt
by Torchmark to seek control.</p>
