	<p class="article-leader">Stratus Computer Inc. introduced a new line of
fault-tolerant computers, replacing its three-year-old
products and expanding into the high-powered mainframe arena
for the first time.
   Analysts said the new products should help Stratus, which
is based in Marlboro, Mass., resume its rapid growth next
year. The company has faced a slowdown in recent quarters as
customers waited for new products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This announcement will help it regain its momentum in the
market," said Neil Weintraut, an analyst with Hambrecht &
Quist Inc. Last year, Stratus's net income rose 21% to $35.4
million, or $1.71 a share, on revenue of $341.3 million. Mr.
Weintraut estimated that per-share profit only will rise to
$1.80 this year, but will jump to $2.25 in 1991.</p>
<p>Stratus's fault-tolerant computers, which are designed to
keep working even if parts fail, are used for on-line
transaction processing. Such applications include bank-teller
networks, stock-trading systems and airline reservations.</p>
<p>Stratus has been a distant No. 2 in the fault-tolerant
market to Tandem Computers Inc. But lately the business has
gotten more crowded with Digital Equipment Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. entering.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp., the leader in
transaction processing, doesn't make its own fault-tolerant
computer. IBM resells those made by Stratus and accounted for
about 30% of Stratus's sales in past years. Yesterday IBM
said it will resell Stratus's new systems as an added part of
its System 88 family.</p>
<p>Stratus unveiled 13 new systems in its announcement at
prices ranging from $94,000 to $9 million. It also will
continue to sell a $37,000 system introduced last fall.
Stratus's new midrange systems, the 200 series, about double
the performance of their 100 series predecessors and cost
about the same amount, from $225,000 to $1.1 million. They
will be available in May. The new mainframe computers, also
available in May, cost as much as $9.4 million.</p>
<p>William Foster, president of Stratus, said Stratus doesn't
expect to sell any of the mainframe systems right away. Carol
Muratore, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. said the
mainframe systems mean that Stratus's "high-end customers
don't go elsewhere" if they need bigger fault tolerant
computers in the future.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Stratus closed at $21.625, down 50 cents.</p>
