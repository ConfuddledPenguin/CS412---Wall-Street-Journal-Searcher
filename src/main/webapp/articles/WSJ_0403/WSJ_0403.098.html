	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp., sharply boosting
charges against its giant junk-bond portfolio, reported an
$835.7 million fourth-quarter loss and disclosed that policy
surrenders totaled $559 million in January and February this
year.
   The wounded insurance holding company also said that the
Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a formal
investigation of possible securities violations by the
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its annual report, First Executive said California
regulators have compelled the company's principal unit,
Executive Life Insurance Co., to refrain from junk bond
purchases and any major transactions with affiliates without
the prior approval of regulators.</p>
<p>Despite higher reserves than earlier announced for
potential bond portfolio losses, First Executive said the
approximate market value of its fixed-maturities investments
remains about $1.5 billion below the $15.27 billion book
value.</p>
<p>With year-end assets of $19.2 billion, Los Angeles-based
First Executive is one of the nation's larger insurance
companies. The company was for many years one of the largest
purchasers of junk bonds from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
now in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>In recent months, First Executive's financial woes have
widened, prompting a plunge in the company stock and a
torrent of surrenders from policy holders. Yesterday, in
national over-the-counter trading, First Executive common
closed unchanged at $2.75 a share on volume of 961,500
shares.</p>
<p>The $559 million of surrenders reported for the first two
months of the year was substantially lower than some
analysts' had speculated. However, the closely watched pace
of those surrenders was almost treble last year's
already-accelerated $1.3 billion in policy returns.</p>
<p>Just as troubled banks can be strained by a surge in
withdrawals, demands for policy returns pose substantial
burdens on insurance companies. First Executive said it has
been "encouraged" lately by a decline in surrender requests.
Also, analysts have been told that telephone calls seeking
information about how to surrender policies have declined.
However, the company warned that its announcements may
reverse that favorable trend.</p>
<p>First Executive said it believes it has sufficient
liquidity to weather current spates of policy surrenders. At
March 23, cash and short-term investments totaled about $2.5
billion, up from $2 billion at year end, the company said.</p>
<p>At the root of the company's larger-than-expected loss was
a surprising $344 million increase in the charge taken for
prospective bond losses. In January, First Executive said it
expected to take a $515 million one-time charge, net of
taxes, to clean up the portfolio. However, with the increase,
that charge totals $859 million.</p>
<p>Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive
officer, attributed the increase to "further turmoil" in the
junk-bond market after the company's January calculations.</p>
<p>With the charge, First Executive's fourth-quarter net loss
totaled $835.7 million, or a loss of $9.98 a share, compared
with net income of $48.2 million, or 42 cents a share, a year
earlier. Counting realized securities losses of $1.06 billion
in the latest quarter, revenue was a negative $540.5 million,
compared with $552.4 million the year earlier.</p>
<p>The latest quarter's results brought losses for the year
to $775.6 million, or $9.67 a share, compared with net income
a year earlier of $174.5 million, or $1.51 a share. Revenue,
including realized securities losses of $1.06 billion, was
$1.19 billion last year compared with $2.14 billion a year
earlier. All results for 1988 have been restated to reflect
accounting changes.</p>
<p>First Executive noted that the newly widened charges for
bond losses in its publicly-reported numbers, based on
generally-accepted accounting principles, don't require
changes in recently reported year-end results to regulators.
They are calculated on very different, statutory assumptions.</p>
<p>The SEC's investigation, titled "In the Matter of First
Executive," was opened last month, according to the company,
and deals with possible violations of securities laws since
June 1988, when First Executive announced plans for a $284
million rights offering. The company said it was cooperating
with the investigation, which supercedes an "informal" probe
begun in January.</p>
<p>A company official declined to elaborate on the
investigation. However, it is believed to focus on questions
of timely disclosure of material information, the absence of
which may have induced stock purchases at inflated prices.</p>
<p>Stock was sold in the rights sale at $15 a share in
October. Within three months, First Executive disclosed its
$515 million write-down and other woes. A number of civil
suits have been launched alleging securities violations
related to the rights offering. The company has said its
disclosure was timely and accurate.</p>
<p>Other investigations also were disclosed, among them
inquiries by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and
the Labor Department into the issue of annuities by Executive
Life related to pension terminations. The company's business
in this area was the subject of a page one article in this
newspaper.</p>
<p>First Executive's disclosure of strictures by California
regulators suggests closer controls over its Executive Life
unit than previously indicated. California's Department of
Insurance has placed permanent observers at the company.</p>
<p>Now, however, all new transactions with affiliates in
amounts exceeding 2% of Executive Life's capital and surplus
must be approved in advance by regulators. At Dec. 31,
Executive Life Insurance Co. had capital and surplus totaling
$459.2 million, indicating that regulators require prior
approval of transactions of more than about $9 million.</p>
<p>Other factors also are impinging on First Executive. The
company said it obtained a waiver from banks for what may
have been a technical default on about $275 million of debt.
The prospective default involved the company's recent
repurchase of about $7.3 million of stock following its
fourth-quarter loss.</p>
<p>First Executive said it plans to seek an amendment to
convenants that would permit it to pay cash dividends and
repurchase stock in cases that aren't currently permitted.
The company has never paid a cash dividend and now is barred
from doing so under debt covenants.</p>
