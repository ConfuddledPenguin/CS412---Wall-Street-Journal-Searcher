	<p class="article-leader">SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. named President John
L. Youngblood to the additional posts of chairman and chief
executive officer, and a member of the executive committee,
at a special meeting of the board.
   Mr. Youngblood, 49 years old, was also chief operating
officer. As chairman and chief executive, he succeeds James
E. Swiggett, 58, who is retiring for "personal reasons," the
company said. Mr. Swiggett will remain a director and member
of the executive committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Kollmorgen said Mr. Youngblood's
appointment was part of a restructuring plan announced in
September. The spokesman said Mr. Swiggett "grew up in the
interconnections business," the printed circuit board
business that is being sold as part of the restructuring
plan. Kollmorgen will be left with its motors and controls
and electro-optical business.</p>
<p>Mr. Swiggett was chairman since 1989 and chief executive
since 1984. During his tenure, Kollmorgen was the subject of
a hostile tender offer from Vernitron Corp., a Deer Park,
N.Y., industrial electronics company that is closely held.
Although the companies later agreed to a friendly merger,
Vernitron pulled out of the $320 million transaction in
September, a week before it was to close. Kollmorgen sued,
and Vernitron countersued. The companies are still involved
in litigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Youngblood earlier had been president of the
electro-optical division. He holds a doctorate in electrical
engineering.</p>
<p>In addition, Kollmorgen elected Robert N. Parker,
president of LTV Corp.'s missiles and electronics group, a
director, increasing the board to 13 members.</p>
