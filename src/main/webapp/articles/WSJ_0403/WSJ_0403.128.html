	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As chief of the $56 billion California Public
Employees Retirement System, the U.S.'s largest pension fund
for civil servants, Dale M. Hanson is giving a lot of
corporate executives sleepless nights.
   The 47-year-old Mr. Hanson has made one thrust after
another into boardrooms across the U.S., prodding companies
to pay more attention to their giant shareholders. Just last
week Calpers took a highly publicized stand in proxy voting
against the management of Lockheed Corp., even though the
aerospace company agreed to add as many as three board seats
for big institutional investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Two or three years from now," Mr. Hanson says, "hopefully
what we're raising today won't need to be raised -- because
the law of the land or the unwritten law of the land will be
that directors on corporate boards are fiduciaries
representing the interests of shareholders."</p>
<p>The more Mr. Hanson presses ahead, the more his critics
carp about the dangers of concentrating too much firepower in
the hands of pension funds.</p>
<p>"I have serious questions about whether the {proxy} voting
responsibility is properly vested" with fund officials such
as Mr. Hanson, says John Wilcox of the proxy solicitation
firm Georgeson & Co. "He's not really an owner."</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. Hanson isn't likely to go away, although he
complains that shareholder-rights matters are taking "too
much of my time" (about 20% of his 65-hour workweek). He and
other officials of the 700-person Calpers staff are "willing
to take the heat from being out there in front," says Peg
O'Hara, head of the corporate governance services for the
Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.</p>
<p>And there's plenty of heat, even inside Mr. Hanson's own
domain at Calpers, which he joined in 1987. "I personally
feel that management of companies should be the prerogative
of management," says Jack Wickware, a lawyer for Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. who was recently named to the Calpers
board.</p>
<p>The powerful Calpers board, evenly split between labor and
employer members with one added trustee named by the
California Legislature, decided several years ago to take an
activist bent on shareholder rights. In the mid-1980s, the
state's then treasurer, the late Jesse Unruh, became irate at
the "greenmail" companies were paying to buy back their stock
from raiders -- a practice of no benefit to Calpers and other
shareholders.</p>
<p>The board later fired its top administrator and hired Mr.
Hanson, who had spent 20 years working his way up to the No.
2 spot in the Wisconsin retirement system, as the first
executive from outside Calpers to head the California system.
Although Mr. Hanson didn't bring shareholder activism to
California, "he quickly discovered it was the most exciting
part of the job," a colleague says.</p>
<p>Being willing to take the heat -- and pay the expenses
connected with shareholder activism -- has gained Calpers at
least a symbolic role in the affairs of a fast-growing list
of companies.</p>
<p>A breakthrough occurred early last year when Texaco Inc.,
rewarding Calpers for opposing raider Carl Icahn's proxy
fight with the oil company, named a director from among
candidates compiled by Calpers. The director didn't promise
Calpers anything, but the fund still could claim some
tangible action by a major company. Calpers also has
sponsored dozens of other shareholder rights proxy
resolutions, proposed a massive overhaul of the proxy voting
system and targeted General Motors Corp., UAL Inc. and
Occidental Petroleum Corp., another big California-based
company, for criticism on various grounds.</p>
<p>There's no question that corporate America is eager to
listen to Mr. Hanson's views. Just take a look at his
appointment book for last week.</p>
<p>It began in Detroit, with a Monday tour of GM's Technical
Center at the invitation of GM Chairman Roger Smith, followed
by lunch with Mr. Smith. On Tuesday, Mr. Hanson was slated to
rub shoulders with the chief executives of General Mills,
Texaco and Champion International, among others, at
Champion's Treetops company retreat in Connecticut.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, there was a lunch with General Electric
Co.'s Chairman Jack Welch at his invitation; Thursday it was
back to New York for investment discussions at Salomon
Brothers before flying home. Friday he was in Sacramento,
Calif., for a single day in the office, before he flew to
Washington on Sunday for a week of lobbying and conferences.</p>
<p>Such a star-studded schedule is hardly typical for a
public servant, but it is becoming routine for Mr. Hanson,
who has become the most visible activist for funds nationwide
as they flex their $2.2 trillion in financial muscle.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanson maintains that Calpers' 866,000 beneficiaries
have few investment options other than to buy and hold stocks
for decades. Funds don't want to run companies, he says, but
as long-term owners, they do want periodic contact with
directors. "It's the care and feeding of stockholders; if a
company has large stockholders, it's much better to know
them" before problems arise, he says.</p>
<p>But while a strong believer in that message, Mr. Hanson
says he is the accidental activist, taking up the role on
orders from his 13-member board of trustees that decides
policy for the Calpers system. "If you told me that I would
be doing this corporate governance activity, I think I would
have looked at you in disbelief," Mr. Hanson says of his
expectations on joining Calpers.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanson has been adept at winning backing from a
majority of the Calpers board for his proxy-season game plan,
giving him a largely free hand to try to wring out
concessions from companies. "He reads the board's tea leaves
very well," says Greta Marshall, now an outside money
manager, who worked with Mr. Hanson while she was Calpers'
chief investment officer. "That's to his great credit."</p>
<p>For example, after winning a vague promise from Texaco
Chief Executive James Kinnear in mid-1988 on a role for big
institutions in picking a director, months passed without
further action. By November, Mr. Hanson was ready for a
showdown with Texaco, but went back to his trustees first.</p>
<p>"I said I want a gut check," Mr. Hanson recalls telling
the trustees. "This is what I want to push for, but I don't
want to push for it if you're not behind me. They said you're
the closest to it, so go for it." Mr. Hanson filed a proxy
resolution to form a shareholders advisory committee and set
a December deadline for Texaco to act; the company agreed to
a nominee from Calpers' list in January and Calpers dropped
its threatened proxy squabble.</p>
<p>"I have a very warm spot in my heart for Texaco," Mr.
Hanson now says. He adds of Mr. Kinnear, "He was really the
first corporate CEO that I had any exposure to, and that
relationship has kind of evolved" to include meetings such as
those at Treetops, where Messrs. Hanson and Kinnear have meet
twice in recent months with others on both sides to discuss
shareholder rights matters.</p>
<p>Such meetings have helped cool the fighting rhetoric
between companies and Calpers. "There are things Dale is
doing that I would like to talk him out of, but that is
between him and me," says attorney Ira M. Millstein, a
Treetops attendee whose clients include the Business
Roundtable made up of corporate heavyweights.</p>
