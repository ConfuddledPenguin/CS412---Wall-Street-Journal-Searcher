	<p class="article-leader">Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, in an about-face, said
he let his $45 a share, or $1 billion, tender offer for
Georgia Gulf Corp. expire yesterday and now plans to support
Georgia Gulf's recapitalization plan.
   The investor and NL Industries Inc., a Houston chemicals
concern that he controls, said they made the decision after
Georgia Gulf's management two weeks ago restructured its plan
to offer cash and new securities for current shares, and the
Atlanta company's stock price climbed about 10%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, the move may fuel criticism that the investor,
who just last week led a proxy fight to oust the board of
Lockheed Corp., simply was trying to push Georgia Gulf's
management to sweeten its offer to protect his investment in
the company. When he began the tender offer in February,
Georgia Gulf's stock was trading at about $36 a share, below
Mr. Simmons's average purchase price of about $37 a share for
his 2.3 million Georgia Gulf shares, or 9.6% stake.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Simmons and Georgia Gulf have had difficulty
getting financing for their respective offers, with Mr.
Simmons planning to finance his buy-out largely with bank
debt and Georgia Gulf hoping to raise about $200 million in
the troubled junk bond market.</p>
<p>In mid-March, Georgia Gulf amended its plan to offer
shareholders $30 cash, $8.50 face amount of a new issue of
15% senior subordinated notes due in 2000 and one new share
of common stock for each common share currently outstanding.
The plan reduced the cash paid to shareholders and paid the
new debt directly to shareholders, eliminating the need to
turn to skittish junk-bond investors. Georgia Gulf valued the
offer at $49.50 a share, and its stock climbed from about $40
a share to close yesterday at $44.50 a share, down 37.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michael Snetzer, president of Mr. Simmons's
holding company, Valhi Inc., said that Mr. Simmons had "more
than one proposal" for bank financing and could have lined up
the $800 million needed for his offer. But Mr. Snetzer said
that Mr. Simmons didn't want to raise his offer from $45 a
share and didn't want to pay a 2.5% to 3.5% fee for bank
financing if Georgia Gulf's offer was at least as good as
his.</p>
<p>"We've evaluated the second offer and believe it will
deliver" at least $45 a share, Mr. Snetzer said. However, he
said that Mr. Simmons and NL may consider making another
offer if the recapitalization plan isn't approved by Georgia
Gulf's stockholders at its April 19 shareholders meeting and
isn't completed promptly.</p>
<p>NL also said that it will allow a consent solicitation to
remove Georiga Gulf's directors to expire on April 6 without
taking any action.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, officials of Georgia Gulf, a chemicals
concern, didn't have any comment on Mr. Simmons's move.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Simmons, who owns 18.9% of Lockheed Corp.,
led a proxy battle to replace Lockheed's board with his own
nominees and to force the big defense company to adopt a
number of shareholder-rights initiatives. Although the final
vote isn't expected until April 16, Lockheed officials said
they believe their candidates won. Mr. Simmons has said he
believes the vote will be close and says he believes he won
on the shareholder-rights proposals.</p>
<p>As with Georgia Gulf, critics charged that the Dallas
investor began the fight with Lockheed to boost the share
price. Mr. Simmons purchased his stock at an average of $44 a
share, while Lockheed's stock closed yesterday at $36.125, up
12.5 cents, in Big Board trading.</p>
