	<p class="article-leader">Michael Frayn is a prolific English literary polymath, a
fluent professional who has bounced between genres with an
insouciant neglect of the standard hierarchies. His new novel
"The Trick of It" (Viking, 172 pages, $17.95) is his first in
16 years, and the path that led him to it is most unusual.
   He was born in 1933 in a London suburb, and after reading
"Moral Sciences" (philosophy) at Cambridge became a reporter
and columnist on the Guardian and then the Observer from 1957
to 1968. In the mid-1960s he published no less than four
collections of satirical pieces with titles like "Never Put
Off to Gomorrah" and "Pas Devant les Enfants," which contain
such "apercus" as "a child is rather like a television set,
in fact -- and turning the sound down when company comes
isn't enough to prevent all eyes in the room from being
irresistibly drawn towards it."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But while turning out his columns, and features on Cuba,
Israel, Japan and Sweden, and TV plays and documentaries on
Berlin, Vienna and Australia, Mr. Frayn was also writing
novels in a happy exploratory way. His first, "The Tin Men,"
a social satire of the TV and computer age, came out in 1965.
Over the next eight years he published "The Russian
Interpreter" (about Moscow literary smuggling), "Against
Entropy" (a Fleet Street satire), "A Very Private Life" (a
dystopian moral fable about a drug- and TV-saturated fascist
future not unlike those of "1984" and "A Clockwork Orange")
and "Sweet Dreams" (a satirical fantasy about the banal
afterlife of a banal London milquetoast).</p>
<p>Energetic and varied indeed, but there's more. A book of
pensees and obiter dicta called "Constructions" came out in
1974. Translations of Tolstoy and Chekhov started to appear
at the end of the decade. And all the while -- from 1970 on
-- Mr. Frayn was also becoming a Major Contemporary English
Playwright, the author of nine plays about provincial
newspapers, Cambridge college reunions, Frankfurt trade
fairs, journalists in Cuba, urban renewal and friendships,
and -- most conspicuously -- a farce about farce: "Noises
Off" (1982), in which a touring theatrical company doing a
dreadful British Sex Comedy (called "Nothing On") comes apart
at the seams in midperformance. Life imitates art imitating
life, and whirl is king.</p>
<p>Mr. Frayn has now returned to the novel with a new energy
and ventriloquistic control. "The Trick of It" is composed of
a series of letters from an English academic hack -- a
32-year-old provincial professor of modern lit -- to a former
colleague now in Australia. These letters narrate his
conquest and command of his subject: a 44-year-old English
lady novelist (a mix of Iris Murdoch and Doris Lessing) whom
he's been studying and lecturing on for a dozen years. He
invites her to his campus, he inserts himself into her bed,
he lurks about her life in London, he makes himself useful
and finally marries her.</p>
<p>Whereupon he removes her from London to a suburb of his
grim campus town and attempts to reshape her latest novel,
turning her unfashionable moral seriousness into his
deconstructive "ludic" trickery (she needs "some sense of
detachment, of ironic self-awareness"). When she resists his
critical meddling and becomes fascinated with his elderly
relatives, his resentment grows, and he moves himself and his
wife to the University of Abu Dhabi, in the midst of a
desert. But even there "she's fecund; I'm not." While she's
busy writing a new novel about the mother he neglected back
in England, he fails to write anything more than envious,
self-serving letters. He can't fence her imagination in, and
he can't escape the vicious circle of his own barren
narcissism.</p>
<p>This kind of unreliable, vain narrator whom we delight in
seeing through, even as we enjoy his mobile wit, comes in
many shapes and colors: Henry James and Nabokov excelled in
virtuosic variations on the literary life, and Mr. Frayn's
wretch is a late descendant of James's "publishing scoundrel"
in "The Aspern Papers." What Mr. Frayn has done is to turn up
the comic volume, using his dramatic skills to give us a
voice that resonates with the rich self-love of a redbrick
Malvolio:</p>
<p>"I know her mind and I know her heart, and I know them
backwards, forwards and sideways. I know them better than she
knows them herself. . . . These soft bulges beneath my hand
were not just parts of a woman -- they were bits of an
author, of (as I believe) a very fine author, just possibly
of a great author -- of an author whose works I had been
reading and studying and expounding for the past twelve
years]"</p>
<p>He concedes he is violating the "taboo against intercourse
with an author on your own reading-list" but is quick to note
that her underwear doesn't match (pink bra, white panties):
"I was deeply shocked by this appalling solecism, it's true.
But then I was moved by the artlessness of it. Suddenly she
seemed hopelessly vulnerable, and of course at once I became
wild to storm these melting walls. So then I triumphed in my
pleasure and conquest. . . . This was a revenge for all those
long years when she had been up there, oblivious of me, and I
had been down here gazing so intently up at her."</p>
<p>Ever witty and self-deceived, our narrator gnashes his
teeth at the ways the artist simply won't submit to his
control -- anymore than a mother will submit to the control
of her four-year-old would-be incestuous son. So in this
novel of literature and criticism, older woman and younger
man, Mr. Frayn has confected a comic variation on some
classic themes: Oedipus meets the Muse, and she escapes.</p>
