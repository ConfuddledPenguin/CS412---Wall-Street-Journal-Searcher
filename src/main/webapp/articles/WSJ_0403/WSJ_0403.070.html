	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- Carlo De Benedetti and Silvio Berlusconi
led Italy's charge into Europe well before 1992 was declared
the year for economic unity in Western Europe. And they got a
head start on others in Eastern Europe when Communism began
to collapse there.
   Mr. De Benedetti, chairman of computer-maker Ing. C.
Olivetti & Co. S.p.A., turned around an ailing typewriter
company in West Germany. He has invested in Spain, Portugal,
Greece and Hungary. Two years ago he tried to form the first
pan-European holding company through a hostile takeover of
Societe Generale de Belgique, which owns more than 1,200
companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Berlusconi was just as active. He added television
stations in France and Spain to his three private Italian
networks. He obtained the rights to sell television
advertising in the Soviet Union, began making TV movies, and
turned up wherever a new commercial TV venture was launched.</p>
<p>But late last year, Italy's European standard bearers got
into a brawl that is tying them down at home and distracting
their efforts to expand abroad. The battle, over Italian
publisher Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., drags the two
entrepreneurs from boardroom to courtroom to shareholders'
meetings in Milan and Rome. Meanwhile, German, French and
British executives are scurrying from Madrid to Moscow
signing joint venture deals that might well have whetted the
appetites of the Italian tycoons.</p>
<p>"A few years ago Italian companies led the wave of
investments in Europe," says Romano Prodi, former chairman of
state holding company IRI. "But that was short-lived, and now
we're back to the internal fighting" of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>"We have no government," adds Mr. Prodi, "just strong
individualistic entrepreneurs sending their foot soldiers
against each other and killing each other off in their
strange wars."</p>
<p>Indeed, the intrigues and infighting among Italy's tiny
corporate elite -- Signori De Benedetti and Berlusconi along
with Giovanni Agnelli of Fiat S.p.A. and Raul Gardini of
agribusiness giant Ferruzzi Group -- command banner headlines
in the rival newspapers they own, and dominate Milanese
cocktail-party gossip. The battles are local, bitter,
intense, and perplexing to foreigners, as well as to many
Italians.</p>
<p>Among the most difficult to fathom is the continuing
struggle over Mondadori. Mr. De Benedetti first invested in
the ailing publisher in 1984 and took effective financial
control three years later after the death of then-chairman
Mario Formenton. Under De Benedetti guidance, Mondadori's
profits tripled and its market capitalization soared from $80
million to about $2 billion.</p>
<p>The Formenton family signed a contract agreeing to turn
over their 25% holding to Mr. De Benedetti for 200 billion
lire ($167 million), by the end of January 1991. But last
December, Mario Formenton's son, Luca, and other relatives
decided instead to sell their shares at a higher, undisclosed
price to Mr. Berlusconi, who had been buying Mondadori shares
on the open market. This gave him a majority of the common
shares.</p>
<p>Despite howls and lawsuits from the De Benedetti camp, Mr.
Berlusconi was elected chairman of Mondadori at a January
meeting of holders of common stock, and took over day-to-day
operations of the company. But Mr. De Benedetti controls 80%
of the Mondadori preferred stock, with the power to decide on
capital increases for the company. And he can use this power
to block Mr. Berlusconi's ambitions or paralyze the company.</p>
<p>Both sides insist there are higher issues than money in
the struggle. De Benedetti aides claim that press freedoms
are at stake. Mondadori's crown jewels are the daily La
Repubblica and newsweeklies L'Espresso and Panorama. If Mr.
Berlusconi succeeds in taking over these publications, he
will achieve near-monopoly control over Italian media, warns
Corrado Passera, the executive leading Mr. De Benedetti's
fight for Mondadori. The media element "makes this more than
just a battle between two guys," insists Mr. Passera. "There
is . . . an attempt to silence a strong critical voice in
Italy."</p>
<p>Nonsense, say the Berlusconi people: Their boss, the TV
mogul, wants above all to ensure that Italy becomes a major
media player on the continent at a time when the European
Community is moving toward a more unified market and walls
are tumbling in Eastern Europe. "You've got to be multimedia
and multinational now," says Berlusconi lieutenant Fedele
Confalonieri. Under Mr. Berlusconi's guidance, he contends,
Mondadori would spread its interests beyond Italy and compete
with other global press magnates, like Rupert Murdoch and
Robert Maxwell.</p>
<p>A lot of ego is involved in the Mondadori struggle. Both
entrepreneurs are self-made megamillionaires of the same
generation who rocketed into prominence about the same time.
In a country where so few people control so much of the
economy, perhaps the only surprise is that they hadn't
clashed publicly before.</p>
<p>Mr. De Benedetti is 55 years old, the son of a Jewish
family that fled to Switzerland during World War II to escape
Fascist persecution. He started in his family's small machine
shop and built it into a thriving concern before leaving for
a top post at Fiat. His personality and ambitions eventually
rubbed against Mr. Agnelli's, and he left Fiat in a parting
as dramatic in Italian business circles as was Lee Iacocca's
exit from Ford in the U.S. in 1978.</p>
<p>Mr. De Benedetti wound up at Olivetti, then a sickly
typewriter manufacturer, and turned it into a major computer
company. At the same time, he invested his own and other
people's money in a wide range of ventures: Buitoni pasta,
which he later sold to Nestle S.A.; a slice of French fashion
house Yves Saint Laurent; and various finance and publishing
firms.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, bull markets helped him turn assets of
$2 million in his personal investment companies into a
conglomerate, called Cofide, which controls assets now valued
on stock markets at nearly $7 billion. He's one of Italy's
richest men.</p>
<p>But he isn't standing still. The "easy finance" that made
him so wealthy in the last decade is over, Mr. De Benedetti
says. In the 1990s, "I'll get back to what I'm capable of
doing, which is running industry, during a great period of
reindustrialization."</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs on both sides of the Atlantic are professing
renewed interest in the nurturing of industry, now that
corporate raiders, leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds are in
bad odor. All the more reason for his rivals to insist that
Mr. De Benedetti remains a kind of wheeler-dealer.</p>
<p>"De Benedetti is above all a man of finance," says Mr.
Confalonieri, general manager of Mr. Berlusconi's holding
company. "Berlusconi is a man of industry, a builder from
zero. That's the difference."</p>
<p>It's a distinction lost on many Italians. They see
numerous similarities in the men's careers, particularly
their swift climb to riches.</p>
<p>Mr. Berlusconi, the son of a Milan banker, worked at
various jobs including stints as a singer at Adriatic Sea
resorts and as a tour guide around the country before getting
a law degree and setting up a construction company. He made
an initial fortune building residential projects, and burst
on the Italian business scene by forming the first national
television network in 1978. While technically such networks
were illegal, Mr. Berlusconi slipped through a loophole: He
bought up hundreds of local stations, and sent them cassettes
of recorded programs, often by messengers on motorbikes, for
simultaneous broadcasting.</p>
<p>He still isn't allowed to beam live news or sports. And
while his programs aren't necessarily uplifting -- game
shows, "Dynasty" and cheap-to-produce talk shows are the
typical fare -- they are hugely successful.</p>
<p>Mr. Berlusconi, 53, now owns two other Italian networks,
controls more than a third of the advertising revenue on
Italian TV and owns a Milan daily newspaper, Il Giornale. He
also owns all or part of stations in France, Spain, West
Germany and Yugoslavia. Other properties include Italy's
biggest department store chain, La Standa; a chain of movie
theaters; the AC Milan soccer team; and insurance, financial
service and real estate companies. His 100%-owned Fininvest
S.p.A. has consolidated annual sales of close to $10 billion,
and reported a profit of $152 million in 1988.</p>
<p>With a fortune estimated between $1 billion and $2.5
billion, Mr. Berlusconi, too, is among Italy's richest men.
He looks the part, with his elegant clothes and smoothed-back
hair, as he shuttles among sumptuous homes all over Europe.</p>
<p>For now, though, the Mondadori mess has grounded him in
Italy.</p>
<p>Last week, his rival Mr. De Benedetti won a round when a
Milan court ruled in his favor on a technical matter that
would unblock voting rights of 16.4% more of Mondadori's
holding company, depriving Mr. Berlusconi of his majority
there. Today, at a special Mondadori shareholders' meeting,
Mr. De Benedetti will try to push through a capital increase
of 320 billion lire ($256 million) that would help the
company pay its debts of more than 400 billion lire. Such a
capital increase would also give him control of the common
shares and put him back in the chairman's seat. Mr.
Berlusconi has proposed a smaller capital increase, under
which he would retain majority control of the common shares.
But Mr. De Benedetti, with his authority over holders of
preferred stock, can, and almost certainly will, block this
proposal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the whole matter remains before assorted Milan
and Rome courts and tribunals, and may not be resolved for
months. Last week, Mr. Berlusconi hinted he was ready to
negotiate a settlement, but yesterday Mr. De Benedetti said
chances of an early accord are "dead."</p>
<p>The climate for negotiations hasn't been helped by the
media spotlight. Editors at La Repubblica and Panorama have
mercilessly attacked their nominal boss, Mr. Berlusconi, in
print, dragging up his past association with a now-dissolved
Masonic lodge, P-2. Some P-2 members -- though not Mr.
Berlusconi -- were accused of various plots against the
government in the late 1970s. Mr. Berlusconi hasn't attempted
to replace these editors, perhaps because he fears a public
outcry.</p>
<p>De Benedetti aides, on the other hand, are incensed by
what they allege to be attempts by Mr. Berlusconi, using his
political connections, to embarrass their boss. Recently, for
example, Mr. De Benedetti was summoned to give testimony in a
trial that touched on the decade-old Banco Ambrosiano
scandal, which involved the mysterious suicide of banker
Roberto Calvi in London amid allegations of the misuse of
funds by the Vatican Bank in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Mr. De Benedetti had become vice-chairman of Banco
Ambrosiano for two months to help try to clean it up, and
several investigations have found that he acted blamelessly.
But the latest Ambrosiano court hearing was held three days
before a crucial Mondadori shareholders' meeting -- and De
Benedetti allies don't think the timing was accidental.</p>
<p>Just when the Mondadori affair will end is anybody's
guess. The most probable outcome, both sides hint, is a
breakup of the company that would give Mr. De Benedetti
control of La Repubblica, a string of local newspapers and
L'Espresso magazine, while Mr. Berlusconi would get Panorama
magazine and the book publishing business.</p>
<p>"De Benedetti has got to win Mondadori, or at least La
Repubblica, for the sake of the rule of law in Italy," says a
banker involved in the battle who asks for anonymity. "He had
a contract {for the shares held by Formenton family}. If he
loses what are contracts worth here?"</p>
<p>There are also other reasons Mr. De Benedetti is perceived
to have more of a stake than his rival. He has suffered a
number of setbacks over the past two years. While long known
as a visionary who was ahead of the pack on 1992, on Eastern
Europe, and on the need for global alliances, others have
seemed to benefit more from his ideas recently than he has.</p>
<p>Mr. De Benedetti's bold bid to create a pan-European
holding company by buying Societe General de Belgique was
thwarted by management allied with Cie. Financiere de Suez of
France. An accord between his Olivetti and American Telephone
& Telegraph Co., which was to marry computers and telephone
technology, collapsed when neither partner saw much benefit
from it. His move into Hungary via a new holding company is
promising, but now Mr. De Benedetti is far from alone:
Budapest teems with investment bankers seeking to put cash in
Hungarian companies as a foothold into Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"His image is tarnished," says Chris Moore, Italian
securities analyst for Morgan Stanley International in Milan.
Mr. Moore sees growing problems in Mr. De Benedetti's
flagship, Olivetti, where, according to company executives,
earnings last year fell by as much as 45%. Olivetti's stock
price is near the low end of its range over the last 12
months.</p>
<p>Why then has Mr. De Benedetti let himself get so enmeshed
in the Mondadori dispute? "It's very simple," he says. "There
is only one way to never get into battles: Don't move. If you
don't act, if you stay where you are, then you just keep what
you have."</p>
<p>Mr. Berlusconi, for his part, is hoping that once the
Mondadori conflict is resolved he can focus again on a
grander vision: to reverse the decades-old dominance of
European airwaves by American television shows. "We've got to
challenge the one-way flow of programs from the U.S. to
Europe by making more of our own," he told a business
conference in Venice last year. And with satellite
transmission opening up TV markets across the continent, Mr.
Berlusconi's inventory of over 70,000 hours of his own
programs looks like a potential bonanza.</p>
<p>"I hope to fly high in the new great, free skies of Europe
to come," he said.</p>
