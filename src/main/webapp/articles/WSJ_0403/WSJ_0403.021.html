	<p class="article-leader">YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- GF Corp. said it agreed in principle
with an investor willing to provide funds for the financially
troubled office furniture producer, but declined to disclose
the amount of the proposed financing, its form and the
identity of the prospective investor until a final agreement
is negotiated.
   GF said it will obtain equity or debt funding or both
within seven days, subject to negotiation of the final pact
and approval by GF's lenders. The company operates two
plants; it closed its initial plant in Youngstown recently,
as part of a restructuring intended to reduce costs.</p>
