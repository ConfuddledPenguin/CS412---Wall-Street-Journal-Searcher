	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Grab hold of your in-box. Give it a quick,
violent jerk, and watch the papers scatter. That will give
you a rough idea of what the economy of Brazil looks like at
the moment.
   Intent on stopping runaway inflation, new President
Fernando Collor de Mello has instituted a series of sweeping
measures, including restricting people's access to their own
money held in bank accounts. By yanking the economy to a
sudden halt, instituting a new currency, and slapping on
price controls (among other steps), Mr. Collor hopes to break
inflation's back.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the process will be painful for many Brazilians.
According to analysts, it may also hurt earnings for several
U.S. companies with big operations in Brazil, such as
Aluminum Co. of America, Champion International, Ford,
General Motors and Union Carbide.</p>
<p>Securities firms are scrambling to assess the impact.
Early off the starting line is PaineWebber, weighing in with
a report by strategist Edward M. Kerschner (with economic
analyst William Dinning).</p>
<p>The Collor plan "goes well beyond what anyone had imagined
he would do," Mr. Kerschner says. "Of the four possible
reform plans that incoming finance minister Ms. Zelia Cordoso
de Mello had drawn up, Collor went for the most radical. . .
. (It) has thrown the seventh largest economy in the world
into waters rarely charted by any economy.</p>
<p>"For Brazil, a very steep recession seems likely," Mr.
Kerschner concluded. "Most economic activity has ceased. For
example, General Motors did not sell a single car in Brazil
last week."</p>
<p>Aluminum Co. of America derives "at least 15% of its
operating income" in Brazil, estimates Clarence Morrison,
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache. An Alcoa spokesman says
he thinks that figure is "a little high." But he confirmed
that Brazil accounted for 11% of Alcoa's net income last
year.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that Alcoa has been "down there for
about 25 years. It's been good for us and we think in the
long run it will continue to be good for us." However, he
said "what's going on presents some challenges" to Alcoa near
term. He declined to estimate the possible earnings impact.</p>
<p>Union Carbide has a large industrial gases operation in
Brazil, notes Ted Semegran, a chemical analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton. He says a rapid slowing of Brazil's economy
could hurt the business, and is also worried about the
possibility of write-downs connected with currency
devaluation.</p>
<p>Mr. Semegran emphasized that it's too early to know what
will happen. But if the Brazilian operations went to
break-even, he figures it might clip as much as 10% off Union
Carbide's earnings.</p>
<p>John R. MacLean, president of Union Carbide Industrial
Gases Corp. (which includes the industrial gas operations in
the U.S., as well as Latin America) says he thinks Brazil's
government is "doing the right thing." He added, "We would
endure any kind of short-term pain" to do business in a
Brazil that was rid of hyperinflation.</p>
<p>The effects on first-quarter earnings will be very small,
Mr. MacLean said. In the second quarter, he said, "there will
be some negative short-term effects," which he declined to
estimate. He agreed with Mr. Semegran's assessment that if
the Brazilian operations went to break-even, Carbide's
earnings might fall about 10%.</p>
<p>Champion International, a forest products company, derived
about 20% of its net income last year from Brazilian
operations, according to the PaineWebber report. A Champion
spokesman couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Ford was selling more than 2,000 cars a week in Brazil
last year, and GM was selling more than 3,000 a week.
According to PaineWebber, both companies have stopped
producing cars and sent their staffs home on full pay. "This
could be a significant negative for the earnings of both
companies," PaineWebber said, adding that GM is losing money
on North American auto operations and relies on sales outside
North America for profits.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for GM and Ford both said yesterday that it's
too early to assess the earnings impact of the Brazil
situation. According to figures provided by a Ford spokesman,
Brazil accounted for about 1.7% of Ford's world-wide truck
and car sales last year.</p>
<p>The stock most directly affected by Brazil's financial
crisis is Brazil Fund, an investment fund that invests in
Brazilian companies and trades on the New York Stock
Exchange. On March 20, the fund announced it would "halt
temporarily the determination of the fund's net asset value."
That halt is still in effect, and the fund's portfolio
manager declined to be interviewed yesterday.</p>
<p>Yet last month, Brazil Fund shares dropped only 15%, to 11
from 13. That decline was surprisingly mild, considering that
the Brazilian stock market had fallen 40% to 50%, says
Charles H. Brandes, chief investment officer of Brandes
Investment Management in San Diego.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandes bought Brazil Fund shares at 7 last year, when
they traded at about a 40% discount from net asset value, or
NAV (the value of the shares in the portfolio). He rode the
shares up to 16, then sold because they were at a premium to
NAV.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandes guesses that Brazil Fund's NAV now is $9 to
$10 a share. He is watching the stock but says, "It hasn't
gone low enough for me yet." He would be eager to buy if the
shares again fall to a 40% discount, which at the moment
would equal a share price of 6 to 7.</p>
