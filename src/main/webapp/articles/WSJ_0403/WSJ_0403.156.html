	<p class="article-leader">Columbia Savings & Loan Association disclosed that
declines of 50% or more in the value of certain of its junk
bond holdings contributed to its previously reported
insolvency and that it faces possible liquidity problems
because of newly imposed restrictions on its ability to
obtain funds.
   Over the weekend, Columbia, based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., reported that fourth-quarter losses as well as losses
for the first two months of 1990, stemming from the
deteriorating junk bond market, left it insolvent as of Feb.
28 and susceptible to an imminent federal seizure. The
company disclosed further details in a filing yesterday with
the federal Office of Thrift Supervision. The firm also
revealed that its troubles had left its independent auditor,
Deloitte & Touche, unable to render an opinion about its
year-end financial statements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The weekend announcements drew a harsh reaction on Wall
Street yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange trading,
Columbia closed at 71.9 cents, down 40.6 cents.</p>
<p>Among other things, Columbia disclosed that 32 of its
largest junk bond holdings were valued at $308 million less
than it paid for them, with a market value of about $1.8
billion compared with a cost of $2.1 billion, a decline of
15%. Some individual securities owned by the company had even
greater percentage reductions. The company disclosed, for
instance, that its holdings of such troubled issues as
Memorex Telex Corp., E-II Holdings Inc. and Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc. -- for which it paid a total of $280.9
million -- were now valued at only $140.7 million, or about
half as much. It disclosed that Hillsborough Holdings Corp.
bonds for which it paid $65.3 million were currently valued
at $13.2 million -- a decline of 80%, the worst drubbing of
any single issue that the thrift disclosed.</p>
<p>By regulation, the thrift is required to detail its junk
bond holdings only once a year, and the latest filing gives
investors the first detailed look in a year at Columbia's
junk bond portfolio, by far the largest of any thrift in the
country. Its largest holding was RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.,
which, with a market value of $117.2 million, had actually
increased in value by about $2.3 million since Columbia
purchased it.</p>
<p>Columbia also disclosed that because of its insolvency and
other troubles that it was facing new restrictions on
gathering funds from federal sources as well as through the
Wall Street money brokers through which it has historically
garnered roughly two-thirds of its deposits. The company
added, however, that despite the restrictions, it believes
"it will have sufficient liquid assets or financing sources
to meet its reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs in 1990."</p>
<p>Columbia officials declined to comment on the filing.</p>
<p>The filing said the company had roughly $1.5 billion in
cash or cash equivalents as of Dec. 31 to soften any run.
Moreover, its brokered deposits, totaling about $5.0 billion
as of Dec. 31, or about 65% of total deposits, have
maturities ranging from two to 12 years and can't be
withdrawn. The company added in the filing, however, that it
didn't think it would be able to obtain "significant volumes"
of brokered funds in the future because of institutional
concern over its financial condition as well as federal
limits on such activities.</p>
<p>Columbia also disclosed that retail deposits obtained
through its branches declined to about $2.8 billion as of
Dec. 31, compared with $3.1 billion a year earlier, and that
it had sustained an additional $78 million reduction this
past January and February. It was unclear how individual
depositors were reacting to news of the insolvency.</p>
<p>Columbia also said its recent sale of $3.3 billion in
mortgage-backed securities, which it had used as collateral
for obtaining funds, would complicate its deposit-gathering
activities. It said it was counting on making up any deposit
shortfalls through other sources, including advances from
Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. But it said federal
rules covering insolvent institutions make it more costly to
obtain such advances, which stood at about $600 million as of
Feb. 28.</p>
