	<p class="article-leader">Bad news for Washington, if not the Republic: There's
evidence that for most American kids, Washington is history.
A report just out by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress says only about one-third of polled eighth graders
know that Congress makes the laws or could identify the
presidential veto. About half know that the U.S. is a
representative democracy or understand the separation of
powers. Still, there may be reasons for these results.
   Maybe they'd be better able to recognize their government
if someone asked them what a $500 billion omnibus
appropriation bill was. Or a continuing resolution. Most kids
in grade school probably think local judges make the nation's
laws. How is a 13-year-old supposed to know what a
presidential veto is if nobody's spotted more than one or two
since 1974? As to the U.S. being a representative democracy,
is this question related to the 99% re-election rate in the
House of Representatives? The reason some of their parents
don't vote is that increasing numbers of Members have no
opponent in the general election.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We do wonder about one thing, though. If 33% know that
Congress makes laws, what does the other 66% think Congress
does?</p>
