	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors
Corp. posted a combined 1989 net loss of $60.4 million, or
$4.97 a share, including a $55.8 million reserve related to
the planned sales of certain properties.
   The reserve, which was about $20 million more than
expected, reflects anticipated losses from the planned sale
of two Las Vegas hotel-casinos, slightly lower-than-expected
sales prices for other hotels, and higher transactions costs,
said a spokesman for Hotel Investors Trust.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1988, the companies reported net income of $1.3
million, or 11 cents a share. Last year's net income included
$156,000 from gains on sales of certain assets, compared with
gains of $2.6 million in 1988. Revenue rose 23% to $115.5
million from $94 million.</p>
<p>Shares of Hotel Investors Trust, a real-estate investment
trust, and Hotel Investors Corp., a hotel-management concern,
are paired and trade together on the New York Stock Exchange.
Yesterday, the shares fell 50 cents to close at $4.50.</p>
<p>The companies also said they reached a revised agreement
to sell certain of their hotels and allowed a separate sales
agreement involving three hotels to lapse after the tenant,
Northview Corp., filed for bankruptcy-law protection.</p>
<p>The amended agreement calls for the sale of 27 hotels to
an affiliate of EIE International Corp. of Japan for $152.2
million. Hotel Investors announced in February that it had a
definitive agreement to sell 31 hotels to Park Plaza Inc.,
the EIE affiliate, for about $185.8 million.</p>
<p>The transaction was "renegotiated" after Park Plaza
conducted a physical inspection and analysis of all the
properties, the spokesman said. "The benefits {from the
revised transaction} will be close to those expected" from
the earlier agreement, he added.</p>
<p>Hotel Investors said a former trustee, John D. Morrissey,
has rejoined the board to fill a vacancy created after John
F. Rothman resigned as president and chief executive officer
last month. Graeme W. Henderson, the trust chairman, was
named a director of the corporation, also filling a slot
vacated by Mr. Rothman.</p>
