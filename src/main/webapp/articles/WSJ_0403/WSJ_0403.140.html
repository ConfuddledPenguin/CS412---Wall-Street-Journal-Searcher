	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. plans to open talks with Moscow
that could lead to Soviet participation in a costly and
complex program to send astronauts to the moon and on to
Mars.
   Similar talks also are planned with Western allies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A joint Soviet-U.S. mission to Mars has long been a goal
of many U.S. space officials, who say it would lead to
greater cooperation between the two superpowers. But critics
of space cooperation say the U.S. risks giving up advanced
technology. Moreover, regardless of who participates in such
ventures, a mission to Mars would face congressional
opposition because of its huge costs.</p>
<p>Since July 1975, when the U.S. and Soviet Union docked
manned rockets in space, cooperation has been limited mainly
to sharing information on weather and the medical effects of
weightlessness on crews.</p>
<p>Any new U.S.-Soviet venture is still far off. A White
House statement said the talks will focus "on conceptual
possibilities" for cooperation. Apart from the Soviets, the
U.S. will try to set up talks with Western Europe, Canada and
Japan.</p>
<p>The statement said international cooperation "could offer
significant benefits" to the U.S., but didn't say what they
are. In the past, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has sought international partners to build
political support for a project and to share expenses.
Europe, Canada and Japan are expected to spend about $8
billion to build parts of a manned space station; the U.S.
will spend about $30 billion on the project.</p>
<p>Manned missions to the moon and Mars could be the most
expensive project in history. NASA has estimated the cost, in
1991 dollars, at between $471 billion and $541 billion over
35 years. For the current fiscal year, the Bush
administration is asking for $188 million to develop
technology for manned expeditions to the moon and Mars.</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Richard Truly recently testified in
Congress that those costs could grow to between $445 million
and $1.7 billion the following year, depending on how fast
the project is pursued. Preliminary plans call for a return
to the moon near the turn of the century, and a trip to Mars
15 to 20 years later.</p>
<p>It's doubtful that Congress would go along with big budget
requests for exploration. Rep. Bob Traxler, (D., Mich.), who
chairs the House appropriations panel overseeing NASA, hinted
that Congress might cut about $1 billion from NASA's budget
request of $15.2 billion for the year beginning next Oct. 1.
Funding for the Bush exploration initiative would probably be
slashed as part of those cuts.</p>
