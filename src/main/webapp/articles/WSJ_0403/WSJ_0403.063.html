	<p class="article-leader">RICHMOND, Va. -- Heritage Financial Corp. said it intends
to boost the tangible capital of its Heritage Savings Bank
unit by exchanging an $8.4 million subordinated note issued
by the bank in 1987 for common stock. The parent company also
suspended its preferred stock dividend indefinitely to
conserve the bank's capital.
   The proposed swap, which requires regulatory and corporate
approvals, would increase the bank's tangible capital by $8.4
million to a total of $2 million. The transaction would still
leave Heritage Savings $10 million short of new federal
requirements for tangible capital.</p>
