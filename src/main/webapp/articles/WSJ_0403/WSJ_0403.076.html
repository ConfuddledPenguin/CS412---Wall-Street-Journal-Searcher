	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- No credit chill is felt in the second-floor
office of Continental Bank's chairman. Coatless on a cool
rainy day, Thomas Theobald and his deputy for corporate
deals, Vice Chairman Garry Scheuring, remain hot on leverage
as a tool for repairing U.S. competitiveness.
   Since arriving from Citicorp three years ago, Mr.
Theobald, 52, has transformed the big, money-center
institution known as Continental Illinois into a smaller
business bank. Few retail depositors now traipse to tellers
in the grand lobby outside the chairman's quarters. The new
Continental sees itself in the Morgan Guaranty mold, but
reaching out to 2,000 companies instead of only the Fortune
200. Despite the pinch on commercial borrowing in the
American economy, no one's crying ouch here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There's adequate liquidity around," says Mr. Scheuring.
"In some pockets, there have been banks that pulled back. I
don't see it in the target customer base that we look at.
Certainly smaller home builders that rely on S&Ls don't have
the credit facilities that they used to have. At the other
end, larger transactions, HLTs (high-leverage) will be harder
to do. There will be more diligence and screening, but I
think today good businesses have finance available. But at
the edge, small companies, this is a factor."</p>
<p>Mr. Scheuring, who at 50 has risen in 26 years with the
bank, suggests what that "factor" means: "We have an economy
that's growing at about 1%. It doesn't take much to make 1% a
minus 1%. I have a hard time reading that because this is
really unparalled in our experience -- when there's adequate
money but it doesn't want to go. You have enough of that
happen I suppose you do have the possibility of a negative.
On the other hand, it puts a discipline in the system that's
probably OK. Our customers (include) a couple of the largest
home builders in California. They have no problem. Their
small 4- or 5-building competitor who has no equity and wants
to borrow it all can't do it."</p>
<p>Mr. Theobald, meantime, isn't criticizing recent rule
making for whatever contraction is being felt at banks: "In
Boston, you might say it's the regulators, but when you talk
about Bank of America or Wells Fargo (which he sees
retreating from some areas), those are market-induced
strategic decisions." In his view, government is to blame in
the longer run, for restrictions on interstate banking: "If
you go back to the political fault, it was sectioning off the
country into these local markets. It ruined the Texas banks,
it's doing a lot of of damage to the New England banks. Those
are dangerous portfolio inducements." Continental, still
among U.S. banking's Top 25, is expanding out from its
region.</p>
<p>One regulator nod to the "market" has the chairman wary.
That's the increasing resort to "mark to market" accounting
of high-yield assets, which Continental uses in client
restructurings. "Philosophically, I support mark-to-market,"
Mr. Theobald says. "But if you look at the practical,
near-term proposals, they are bastardizations of the idea.
What most of them say is let's pick some selective asset and
mark it down to market. But we'll certainly not permit mark
up of other assets, or we will not permit you to adjust
liabilities according to their value. If you take a British
bank . . . every one, two or three years, they revalue their
real estate. Or Japanese banks have equity securities that
are worth a lot more than book values. If you want to say to
any one of us, let's mark the whole balance sheet to market,
fine."</p>
<p>In any case, he says, "We have several times done detailed
analyses here of marking everything to market, and
ironically, it doesn't come out much different. The law of
large numbers." But with thrifts forced to sell everything
the regulators consider "junk" and mutual-fund redemptions
aggravating the price slide in that market, valuation is
dicier. "If you're an S&L or a commercial bank," Mr. Theobald
says, "you might legitimately ask whether it's reasonable to
have the kind of mentality that's allegedly caused all kinds
of distortions in the industrialized economy visited on them.
You know -- the market's value today is the answer, the
truth."</p>
<p>That's not Wall Street talking. Mr. Theobald emphasizes
he's a company banker. The 146 high-yield deals that
Continental has done don't reflect a desire to empower
financiers -- just the opposite, he says. "People who are
focused on some business, live it and die it, generally do
better than people who work off spread sheets and financial
analysis. A lot of what I see as the virtue of the LBOs, HLTs
and so on is that they are leading to more focused
companies." Even the takeovers? "If you look at the RJR
transaction, and say what was the beginning to end of it, it
was going to be spin-outs. While initially it was gathering
in all these food assets, it was structured in such a way
that they had to redistribute them."</p>
<p>In fact, fundamentals dominate in Mr. Theobald's world.
But don't high real interest or "hurdle" rates shape a
business's decision to buy new machinery vs. take cash out?
"I've never seen it in my career. You can analyze a market to
read in some of those macro factors, but I don't see
businessmen making their decisions with overt weight given to
that kind of consideration. If there's more demand for a
product, they want to expand. If somebody's available to buy
that makes a great synergy, they want to buy. Most of them
look through currency rates and interest rates. And I'm not
sure they're wrong, because currencies and interest rates
fluctuate so much that if you're making a 5- or 10-year
decision, what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>Mr. Theobald disparages congressional credit allocation
incentives, such as moves to raise reserve requirements for
high-yield lending, as "really Third World stuff." Meanwhile,
his bank may finally have other Third World stuff, the
writedown of bad loans to backward nations, behind it. Also,
it isn't too exposed in real estate. Yet Continental's share
price is at a two-year low. Malaise is industrywide, but
analysts worry that new HLTs will be scant and existing ones
rocky.</p>
<p>This bank's particular claim to notoriety remains the 1982
federal bailout of its depositors, the biggest in U.S.
financial history and the hall mark of the "too big to fail"
doctrine that chills the climate for deposit-insurance
reform. (Smaller banks say they need the existing guarantee
of at least $100,000 per deposit in order to compete with
major rivals that enjoy de facto backup.) But Mr. Theobald
offers a footnote on that affair: Internal calculations
suggest that had the feds not stepped in, maybe $1.5 billion
of Continental's $40 billion in deposits would have been
lost.</p>
<p>A haircut that slight suggests it's more feasible to let
the marketplace discipline risky financiers -- and avoid
artificial credit crunches -- than Washington now believes.</p>
