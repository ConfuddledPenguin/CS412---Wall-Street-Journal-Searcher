	<h3>Enterprise: Research Firm Taps Oceans of Data to Bail Out Clients --- But IQ Inc. Finds Such Intangibles As Information Can Be a Hard Sell</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Not long ago, Loeffler Ketchum Mountjoy was in a tizzy. On
just four days' notice, officials of Bojangles' Corp., which
runs a chain of fried-chicken restaurants, wanted to meet
with the little Charlotte, N.C., ad agency to discuss
retaining it.
   But Loeffler knew barely a lick about the fried-chicken
business and feared that boning up would take at least two
weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What to do? Loeffler called IQ Inc., a very small, very
specialized research concern in Maynard, Mass. Within 48
hours, harnessing computers, IQ ransacked thousands of
publications for facts, then churned out two 25-page reports
that it sped to the client. Loeffler won over Bojangles', a
Horn & Hardart Co. unit whose estimated ad billings exceed
$500,000 a year. "IQ made us look smart," says Jeffrey Petit,
a Loeffler supervisor.</p>
<p>At first blush, IQ -- short for "information quickly," not
"intelligence quotient" -- also looks smart. In the age of
information overload, IQ's niche is selling business
information -- the sort that is out there somewhere but that
most people can't find quickly on their own. For example, IQ
has identified the leaders in vacuum-pump technology (Balzer
Inc., for one), traced the retail value of all the hot dogs
sold in the U.S. ($1.5 billion in 1983) and fingered a maker
of frozen milkshakes made for thawing in microwave ovens
(United Dairies of Ohio). Little escapes IQ: It is expert in
tapping the oceans of data in publicly accessible computer
data bases -- a booming technology.</p>
<p>But IQ, while profitable, isn't necessarily on a sure-fire
path to enormous success. Five years after IQ was founded,
the company has served just 150 clients and its annual
revenue is less than $2 million. Founder David Manshel, a
35-year-old former ad-agency account supervisor, concedes,
"It has been a rough road."</p>
<p>Indeed, IQ faces a problem common to growing numbers of
new companies as the American economy tilts more and more
toward services: Instead of offering a familiar product, more
companies are tying their fortunes to amorphous services that
are barely familiar, or totally unfamiliar, to the target
audience.</p>
<p>That makes business start-ups all the harder. Selling such
intangibles as advice, insurance and market forecasts is
tough because "you can't ask someone from a laboratory to
come in with a prototype so everyone can look, touch and feel
it," says Mark Deck, a principal of Temple, Barker & Sloane
Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. An intangible
service is "just something in your head" in the eyes of the
prospective customer, Mr. Deck says.</p>
<p>IQ isn't selling any proprietary information of its own
and can't even be certain what its computers will fish up for
a client. The challenge for IQ -- and for a few similar
concerns -- is getting companies to pay "to know what they
don't know," as Mr. Manshel puts it. And clients can't know
if the unknown is worth paying for until after they've paid
for it.</p>
<p>"It's a lengthy sell," says Mr. Manshel, who financed IQ
through loans from his family and friends and through
savings. "You have to constantly give examples of where you
can be helpful."</p>
<p>As the number of data bases available to libraries has
soared into the hundreds, greater expertise is required to
master all the possibilities for harvesting data. IQ says it
can find information that customers can't find on their own
because they don't know where to look. For each assignment,
IQ charges a minimum of $500 -- and sometimes thousands of
dollars, depending on the scope of the job. But left to their
own devices, IQ says, customers would waste a fortune
searching indiscriminately through data bases (which
typically charge by the minute for access).</p>
<p>Maybe so, but many companies still doubt the need for IQ
when they have their own in-house information centers. Some
may balk at IQ's rates, since simple computer searches
normally involve only about $15 in data-base charges,
according to industry figures. Others hesitate to depend too
heavily on a single outside research firm, lest it miss
something crucial.</p>
<p>Mr. Manshel directs 12 part-time researchers working on
home computers in assorted cities who, on average, have 12
years' experience in data-base research. Because of
consulting work, he adds, they've learned a lot about
marketing, advertising, public relations and sales.</p>
<p>IQ promises to work faster than corporate libraries -- an
offer some busy managers can't pass up after waiting a week
or more for results from in-house searches. And IQ promises
to weed out irrelevant information turned up by searches, so
as not to waste readers' time.</p>
<p>IQ's pace impressed ad executive Richard Hill, who at the
time was manager of McCann Erickson Worldwide Inc.'s Boston
office. Mr. Hill recalls that McCann's New York library
usually had a week's backlog of work. So to prepare more
quickly for one crucial meeting, Mr. Hill turned to IQ. The
result: He got the information in 36 hours and now credits IQ
with helping McCann win a new account.</p>
<p>IQ hopes during the next five years to extend its customer
base, now mostly advertising and public-relations agencies,
to health-care companies, retailers and financial-services
firms. To familiarize people with its service and break down
resistance, IQ says it will depend heavily on direct-mail
promotions and phone marketing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cost-cutting efforts by some big companies
might help IQ because inhouse libraries might be slimmed or
eliminated. Says Mr. Manshel, "The opportunity for an
information agency is great."</p>
