	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- Despite forecasts by some experts, oil
prices won't rise on the average much faster than the rate of
inflation over the next several years, a top executive of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group predicted.
   Through the 1990s, that will translate into about a $1 a
year added to the per-barrel price of oil, Sir Peter Holmes,
chairman of Shell Transport & Trading, one of the two owners
of the giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sir Peter conceded that prices could continue to move like
"a roller coaster," bouncing around within an upwardly moving
$4 range. But he said the Shell Group is forecasting a
generally moderate overall trend because it believes the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will expand
production to meet growing world demand. OPEC, which
currently supplies about 45% of the non-Communist world's
oil, is considered pivotal to future price movements.</p>
<p>Recently, a number of forecasters have projected world oil
demand will grow faster than production capacity, triggering
a spike that could double prices by the mid-1990s. Current
world oil prices range from about $16 a barrel to $20 a
barrel.</p>
<p>In taking a more conservative view, Sir Peter also cited
OPEC's apparent desire to avoid a rerun of past rapid price
escalations that produced world turmoil. "They don't want to
see prices run away," he said. In particular, he said,
"Kuwait is determined to keep prices low."</p>
<p>The Shell Group estimates that OPEC's largest producer,
Saudi Arabia, will meet its goal of expanding daily
production capacity to 8.5 million to 10 million barrels from
current capacity of 7.8 million. The other OPEC members with
the potential and desire to boost output -- Iran, Iraq, and
the United Arab Emirates -- also will meet their goals early
in the 1990s, he said.</p>
<p>As a result, Sir Peter predicted, OPEC's daily production
will stay at a comfortable level in relation to capacity. "If
OPEC production remains at around 80% of installed capacity,
it is unlikely you will see prices surge either upward or
downward," he said. In the past, when OPEC output crossed the
80% threshold, he said, prices became far more volatile.</p>
<p>OPEC's Secretary-General Subroto has been saying that OPEC
will need to spend $60 billion over the next several years to
raise its capacity to meet demand for its oil. Subroto has
asked for help from international oil companies, but Sir
Peter doesn't think many countries will seek such outside
financing.</p>
<p>"I don't think the Saudis, Kuwait or the U.A.E. will need
any at all," he said. "Over five years, $60 billion isn't
that much."</p>
<p>Sir Peter said Iran and Iraq may need some help and
disclosed that the company has talked with Iraq officials.
"They have been welcoming and then less welcoming," he said.</p>
<p>The Shell Group sees big opportunities, however, in the
Soviet Union. "We're trying real hard to get in," Sir Peter
said. "It will happen but I think it will be slow." He said
current Soviet oil technology is outdated. "They are
operating with techniques we used 30 and 40 years ago," he
said. "A couple of decades doesn't sound like much, but in
our industry that's the stone age."</p>
