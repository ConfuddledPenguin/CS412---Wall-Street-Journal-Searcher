	<p class="article-leader">Omnicare Inc., Cincinnati, said it purchased Beeber
Pharmacies Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, which provides pharmacy
services to nursing homes. The price wasn't disclosed.
   Omnicare said Beeber had revenue of about $4 million in
the fiscal year ended last June 30. Omnicare had 1989 revenue
of $95 million, mainly in medical and dental supplies for
private practitioners and respiratory equipment for home
care.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nursing home pharmacy service is an attractive business,
Omnicare said, because the institutions are 95% occupied, and
an aging population indicates this market will increase.
Omnicare entered the business in December 1988, with the
purchase of Home Care Pharmacy Inc., Cincinnati, which had
revenue last year of about $10 million.</p>
