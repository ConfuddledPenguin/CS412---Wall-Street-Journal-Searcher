	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office said it can't
determine the extent of aflatoxin contamination in the U.S.
corn crop. Its conclusion that "information is inadequate"
helps clear the way for a push in Congress to strengthen
screening for the carcinogen.
   The conclusion by Congress's investigative arm wasn't
surprising, since industry officials and academics have said
that the spotty surveys conducted by the Food and Drug
Administration and by some states aren't large enough to be
statistically reliable. Moreover, the tests for aflatoxin
often give conflicting results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The House Agriculture Committee is widely expected to
debate whether the next five-year farm bill includes a
provision to screen all U.S. corn exports for aflatoxin and
to improve testing procedures.</p>
<p>In February, the White House signaled that it favored
mandatory screening of corn exports as a way to soothe
importing countries. The voluntary testing of current exports
came under criticism last year from Congress and abroad when
some importing nations detected aflatoxin in U.S. corn and
corn products.</p>
<p>The House subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains
asked the GAO last year to study how federal regulators
handled a widespread outbreak of aflatoxin in corn during the
1988 drought. Aflatoxin is excreted by a fungus during hot
and dry conditions and is suspected of causing human liver
cancer in regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>The FDA restricts corn contaminated with tiny amounts of
aflatoxin from moving across state lines. But a February 1989
article in The Wall Street Journal reported that surveillance
is spotty and enforcement rare.</p>
<p>Between October 1988 and June 1989, according to the GAO,
the FDA found unsafe levels of aflatoxin in 5.5% of the whole
corn it tested as well as in 2.2% of the milled corn it
tested. Food containing more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per
billion is unsafe for human consumption under FDA rules.</p>
<p>In testimony presented yesterday, John W. Harman, director
of the GAO's food and agriculture issues division, briefed
the subcommittee on the preliminary results of the study,
which is expected to be completed this summer.</p>
<p>The fact that the GAO can't determine the extent of
aflatoxin contamination weakens the chance that Congress
might try to compensate growers for contaminated corn.</p>
<p>Corn growers favor compensation as a way to stop farmers
from trying to evade detection by food companies. But it's
impossible to calculate the expense of such a program.</p>
