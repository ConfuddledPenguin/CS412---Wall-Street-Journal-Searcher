	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- High school seniors approaching voting age
lack basic knowledge about U.S. government and history,
according to a federal survey.
   Tests administered by the federally funded National
Assessment of Educational Progress in 1988 -- a presidential
election year -- showed that only 57% of the nation's 12th
graders knew that presidential candidates are nominated by
national conventions. Only 51% knew that the Constitution
guarantees religious freedom.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The National Assessment administered history and civics
tests to national samples of students in the fourth, eighth
and 12th grades. Its tests on these subjects and others will
be used to measure progress toward the ambitious education
goals set for the year 2000 that President Bush and the
nation's governors announced earlier this year.</p>
<p>The tests reveal an uneven grasp of history and civics.
For instance, although 84% of the eighth graders knew how
Abraham Lincoln died, only a quarter knew that his goal in
the Civil War was to save the Union. In civics, only 38% of
the eighth graders knew that Congress makes laws, and only
41% knew that the Supreme Court can declare a law
constitutional.</p>
<p>The history test showed that only 5% of the high-school
seniors scored high enough to demonstrate an ability to
interpret historical information and ideas. "Far too many of
our students know far too little about where we have come
from and about how we as a nation became what we are today,"
said Richard Riley, former governor of South Carolina and a
member of the National Assessment governing board.</p>
<p>Like earlier assessments of reading, writing, science and
math, the latest surveys concluded that students watch too
much television and do too little homework. The surveys
showed that only 28.9% of the high-school seniors tested
spend two or more hours on homework each night, while 47.2%
watch more than two hours of TV. Less than half the students
read more than 10 pages daily in school and for homework.</p>
