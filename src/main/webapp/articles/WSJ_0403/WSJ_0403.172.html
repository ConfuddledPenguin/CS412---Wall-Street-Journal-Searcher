	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. will announce today that
Robert C. Stempel, its 56-year-old president, will be named
chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Roger B.
Smith, who is to retire Aug. 1.
   Mr. Stempel, it was learned, won't be succeeded as
president of GM. Instead, the auto maker will promote two
executive vice presidents to vice chairmen: John F. Smith Jr.
and Robert J. Schultz. Both will retain their current duties,
Mr. Smith as head of GM's international operations and Mr.
Schultz as head of technical staffs and GM's two big
subsidiaries, Electronic Data Systems Corp. and GM Hughes
Electronics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lloyd E. Reuss, another executive vice president who's
responsible for GM's huge North American auto operations,
will become president of those operations, essentially a
change in title. However, he will also gain additional
responsibility by overseeing GM's huge components operations.
Those operations will continue to report to William E.
Hoglund, who continues as executive vice president but now
will report to Mr. Reuss.</p>
<p>Two other executive vice presidents, Robert T. O'Connell
and F. Alan Smith, will remain in their current posts, Mr.
O'Connell as head of financial operations and Alan Smith as
head of corporate staff functions. None of the Smiths --
Roger, John or Alan -- is related.</p>
<p>Mr. Stempel has long been regarded as the favorite to
succeed Roger Smith as chairman of the world's largest
industrial company, but his appointment marks a significant
departure from tradition at GM. Mr. Stempel is an engineer.
GM usually draws its chairmen from its financial ranks.</p>
<p>The company's theory has been that only financial men can
enforce cost discipline at a company where spending is
measured in the tens of billions of dollars. If GM's
engineers were left to their own devices, the reasoning goes,
they would overspend like unfettered Pentagon generals,
bringing mediocre earnings to a company where the boast has
long been: "General Motors doesn't make cars. It makes
money."</p>
<p>But that theory has been blown apart during this decade.
GM spent more than $70 billion in capital outlays during the
1980s, but the company's U.S. market share has dropped more
than 10% and for three years in a row earnings fell behind
those of its smaller rival, Ford Motor Co. Many at GM are
convinced that the company needs a "product man" to revive
its fortunes in its largest market.</p>
<p>Mr. Stempel has that reputation, even though his track
record is somewhat hard to guage. He has had six different
jobs at GM in the past 11 years.</p>
<p>The jobs that brought Mr. Stempel to the fore were his
leadership of GM's Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group, which
makes most of the company's large cars, between 1984 and
1986, and head of truck and international operations in 1986
and 1987.</p>
<p>The BOC group adopted a decentralized operating structure
that has made it far more effective than its counterpart, the
Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group. BOC leads in product quality
and in profitability by a wide margin. GM's international
operations, meanwhile, have turned the corner to handsome
profitability in recent years, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>Because of his relatively young age, Mr. Stempel, like
Chairman Smith, can be expected to have a long tenure at the
helm of GM. His most significant challenge will be turning
around the company's troubled North American auto operations,
which have suffered from a decade of decline.</p>
