	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- West Germany's industrial production dropped a
seasonally adjusted 0.8% in February from January as energy
output plunged 10% because of warm winter weather, the Bonn
Economics Ministry said.
   Though the unusually mild winter depressed output in the
utility sector, the construction industry benefited and
boosted production 5% during the month. Mining output
increased 1.5%, while production in the manufacturing
industry as a whole was off 0.5%.</p>
