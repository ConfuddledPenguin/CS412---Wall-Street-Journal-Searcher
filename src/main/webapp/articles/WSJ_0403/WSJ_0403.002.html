	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Two concerns controlled by shipping magnate
Sir Y.K. Pao said they are seeking to acquire a hotel unit
from Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of New York, in a move
that would extend an overseas expansion binge by Hong Kong
entrepreneurs.
   Spokesmen for Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. and World
International (Holdings) Ltd., two local companies controlled
by the family of Sir Y.K., said negotiations with the U.S.
life insurer are at an advanced stage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The focus of the talks is MetHotels Inc., a Metropolitan
Life unit that runs 35 U.S. hotels under the Doubletree chain
and a further 32 under the Compri chain. Through management
contracts and franchises, MetHotels operates the hotels but
doesn't own equity interest in the real estate.</p>
<p>John T. Hung, a director of Wharf, said the transaction
could be concluded by "the end of May or early June." He
declined to disclose the sum involved.</p>
<p>Stephen Ng, managing director of Wharf, said that, if
completed, the MetHotels purchase would about "double the
size of Omni," a North American hotel chain that Wharf and
World acquired in 1988 for HK$1.05 billion (US$134.5 million
at current exchange rates).</p>
<p>If concluded, the purchase would add to the growing list
of acquisitions -- especially of North American hotel
operations -- by Hong Kong concerns. Among the biggest so far
is the New World group's US$355 million purchase last year of
Ramada Inc. of the U.S.</p>
<p>Given local entrepreneurs' relative unfamiliarity with the
U.S. hotel industry, some of the acquisitions are widely
regarded as a leap into the unknown. But with this British
colony beset by slow economic growth and uncertainty over its
1997 return to Chinese sovereignty, the trend seems likely to
continue.</p>
<p>"It's quite understandable why local hoteliers aren't
buying into more hotel operations in Hong Kong," said Ravi
Narain, an analyst with Peregrine Brokerage Ltd. "Whether the
U.S. offers the best alternative is another question."</p>
<p>World, the principal public company controlled by Sir
Y.K., is about 62.5%-held by members of his family. Wharf, in
turn, is 40%-held by World. The two companies own interests
in Hong Kong real estate, retail businesses and
transportation. Until recently, their hotel operations
consisted only of three outlets in Hong Kong and one in
Singapore. The acquisition of the Omni chain in 1988 helped
the two companies gain their first major presence in North
America.</p>
<p>Omni's North American operations currently consist of 39
hotels with about 16,000 rooms, most of them along the U.S.
East Coast. The chain mainly operates so-called businessmen's
hotels, which offer no-frills accommodation to business
travelers. Except for six or seven of the hotels in which
Omni has equity interests, the operation is limited mostly to
management and franchising.</p>
<p>The MetHotels chain, with about 17,000 rooms, serves a
similar clientele but concentrates more on the West and
Southwest regions of the U.S. Mr. Hung said that these
operations, if merged with Omni, would provide what he termed
a perfect fit. "If you're a businessman traveling in the
U.S., you would be able to book with Omni all the way from
the West to the East Coast," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the MetHotels negotiations have been spurred
by "organic growth" of the Omni operation and not by
political uncertainty in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>To pave the way for the pending acquisition, Wharf and
World also announced a streamlining of their hotel management
business.</p>
<p>The two companies currently own a half interest each in
Carlops Co., a Hong Kong subsidiary that holds the management
rights to the North American hotels. Management rights to the
four Asian hotels, on the other hand, are held by World only.</p>
<p>Under the move, World would sell the Asian management
rights to Carlops for HK$280 million, which becomes the sole
hotel-management vehicle for the group.</p>
