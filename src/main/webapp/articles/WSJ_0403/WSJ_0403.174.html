	<p class="article-leader">Salomon Brothers Inc. will open an office in East Berlin,
in hopes of winning a slice of the expected wave of corporate
finance business that will come with German reunification.
   Initially, the East Berlin outpost will have four or five
professionals from a staff of about 60 working for the
Salomon Inc. unit in Frankfurt, West Germany.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company officials emphasized that the move makes Salomon
the first non-German investment bank to push into East
Germany. Salomon also explored setting up offices in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, and Vienna. James Massey, chief executive
officer of Salomon Brothers International in London, said the
choice of East Berlin "will enable us to bring to bear our
skills and resources in the important and exciting process of
German reunification."</p>
