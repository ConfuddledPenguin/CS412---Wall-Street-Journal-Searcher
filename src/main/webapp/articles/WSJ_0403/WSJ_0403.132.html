	<p class="article-leader">N.V. Amev, the third-largest Dutch insurance company, and
Groupe AG, Belgium's biggest insurer, announced plans to
merge, creating Europe's 12th-largest insurer in terms of
premium income. A final pact is expected before year end.
   Amev and Groupe each would own 50% of a joint venture,
with operating units initially separate, designed to
strengthen both as the European Community moves toward freer
cross-border competition. Groupe would pay 10.7 billion
Belgian francs ($305.3 million) to Amev over 10 years to
cover the difference in Amev's greater value. The two
parents, which also have moved into banking, would keep
separate stock market quotations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The combined companies would have annual revenue of about
$7 billion, assets of $35 billion, and shareholders' equity,
including unrealized gains on assets, of $4 billion. They
have a combined stock market value of about $4.6 billion.</p>
<p>Amev posted a 28% rise in 1989 profit to 354.8 million
guilders ($186 million), or 5.78 guilders a share, from 276.2
million guilders, or 4.97 guilders a share, in 1988.</p>
