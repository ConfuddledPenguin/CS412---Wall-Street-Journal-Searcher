	<p class="article-leader">SASKATOON, Saskatchewan -- Canadian Mining & Energy Corp.,
or Cameco, said it agreed to sell one-third of its wholly
owned Rabbit Lake uranium mine in Saskatchewan to a unit of
Uranerzbergbau G.m.b.H. of West Germany for 160 million
Canadian dollars (US$136.8 million).
   Cameco will use proceeds from the sale, to Uranerz
Exploration & Mining Ltd., to reduce debt to about C$325
million from about C$515 million at year end, said Thomas
Gorman, Cameco vice president, finance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cameco, one of the non-communist world's largest and
lowest-cost uranium producers, is cleaning up its balance
sheet as its owners prepare for an initial public offering of
shares. The governments of Saskatchewan and Canada, which
respectively own 61.5% and 38.5% of Cameco, hoped to proceed
with the issue last year but it was delayed as uranium prices
fell below $10 a pound, or less than one-quarter of their
1979 peak. Mr. Gorman said a modest rebound to $8.80 a pound
in March from $8.70 in February may signal the start of a
long-awaited firming of uranium prices. But he wouldn't
predict when Cameco's public offering will proceed.</p>
<p>The Uranerz transaction, subject to regulatory approvals
and other conditions, is expected to close by July.</p>
<p>Rabbit Lake, one of three uranium mines that Cameco
operates in Saskatchewan, has been closed since March 1989,
as the company upgrades its mill in the face of depressed
uranium prices. The mine's assets also include four adjacent
deposits, with reserves, estimated at 177 million pounds at
the end of 1988, expected to be sufficient to continue
operations well beyond 2000. Uranerz already holds a 33.33%
stake in the south zone of one of the four deposits, known as
Eagle North.</p>
<p>Cameco and Uranerz also are partners at Cameco's Key Lake
uranium mine and at the Star Lake gold project, both in
Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorman said that Cameco's recent discovery of an
additional uranium deposit in Saskatchewan "will essentially
replace the reserves that we are selling" to Uranerz, and
that Cameco doesn't anticipate any further asset sales.</p>
