	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Resolution Trust Corp. has eased its
restrictions for hiring accounting firms that had been sued
by the government for thrift-reorganization work.
   A memo issued late last month by Resolution Trust says
that even though the accounting firm may have been sued by
thrift or bank regulators, it can be hired for reorganization
work under certain conditions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The accounting firm must show that those employees and
offices doing the reorganization work weren't involved in the
previous litigation, the memo says. The firm must also
centrally monitor compliance with the screening out of those
employees previously involved in the litigation, the memo
says.</p>
<p>L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., said a previous policy to avoid using
accounting firms that had been sued was being misunderstood.
"While it's still true that an accounting firm that hasn't
previously been sued in thrift or bank work would be
preferred, we're giving more leeway to hire firms which had
been sued, since they may be the low bidder with expertise
for reorganization jobs," he added.</p>
