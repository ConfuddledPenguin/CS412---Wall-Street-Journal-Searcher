the Finance Ministry concerning new bank establishments.
   Under the rules, the minimum paid-in capital for new banks
will be $10 billion New Taiwan ($378.8 million) and each new
bank will be required to raise 20% of its paid-in capital
from a public offering on the stock market, with each
investor limited to 10,000 shares.</p>

have the right to restrict the number of new banks.</p>
