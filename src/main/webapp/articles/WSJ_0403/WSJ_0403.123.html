	<p class="article-leader">LTV Steel, Cleveland, said its hourly employees approved a
new labor contract that will take effect April 15.
   The contract will extend until Aug. 1, 1993, or until a
plan of reorganization is approved for LTV Steel's parent,
Dallas-based LTV Corp., which is operating under Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement -- covering 13,500 active employees and
laid-off workers plus 46,000 retirees -- provides for
restoration of previous wage and benefit concessions,
additional raises totaling $1.50 an hour and an immediate
payment of $1,000 per worker. The lump sum includes a $500
signing bonus and a $500 advance on the 1990 profit sharing.</p>
<p>Effective April 15, the employees will receive restoration
of base wage cuts amounting to $1.61 an hour, LTV said, plus
restored shift differentials and Sunday premiums. Employees
will get raises of $1 an hour on Jan. 1, 1991, and 50 cents
an hour on Jan. 1, 1992.</p>
