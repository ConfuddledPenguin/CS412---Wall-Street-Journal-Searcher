	<p class="article-leader">OKLAHOMA CITY -- Texas International Co. said its plan of
reorganization will become effective next Monday, two years
after it filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Under the plan, the company will change its name to
Phoenix Resource Cos., all old Texas International securities
will be canceled, new securities of Phoenix will be issued
and a new board will be established, the company said.
Phoenix will continue as an independent oil and gas company,
with primarily overseas business, and will retain ownership
of all assets of Texas International.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reorganization plan, which settles about $150 million
in debt, was confirmed by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court here in
January. Implementation remains subject to approval of the
new trust indentures by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the company said.</p>
<p>Under the plan, trading of Texas International securities
will be permanently suspended prior to the market opening
Friday, and the registries of the company's securities will
be permanently closed at the close of business the same day.
Holders of Texas International securities will be entitled to
receive new Phoenix securities, which will begin trading
Monday on a when-issued basis on the Pacific Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Texas International was delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange in 1986. After several years of struggling under a
heavy debt load, the company sought Chapter 11 protection in
April 1988.</p>
