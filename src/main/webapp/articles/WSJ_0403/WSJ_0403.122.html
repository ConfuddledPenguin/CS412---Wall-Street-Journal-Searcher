	<p class="article-leader">PLEASANTON, Calif. -- Donald Kingsborough has a new
company to play with.
   Mr. Kingsborough, former chairman and chief executive
officer of Worlds of Wonder Inc., is now head of newly formed
Intelligy Corp., which plans to sell educational games and
toys for children. The company said it is developing products
it plans to introduce in late summer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a news release, Intelligy cites Mr. Kingsborough's
tenure at Worlds of Wonder, "one of the nation's fastest and
most successful start-ups in history" -- without mentioning
that it also became one of the industry's most spectacular
failures.</p>
<p>Intelligy marks Mr. Kingsborough's third attempt to find
lasting success in the toy business. He was a top sales
executive for video game maker Atari Inc. when that company's
market suddenly dried up. In 1983, Atari, then owned by
Warner Communications Inc., posted a loss of $538.6 million.
After that, he regrouped with other former Atari managers to
found Worlds of Wonder in 1985. That company chalked up huge
sales and zoomed to the top of the toy industry.</p>
<p>But in 1987, Worlds of Wonder filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
Mr. Kingsborough resigned in April 1988 at the request of
creditors.</p>
