	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it had a loss of $1.01
billion for the fourth quarter after a $947 million write-off
of good will and warned that it might have to seek
bankruptcy-law protection if it can't complete a financial
restructuring.
   The owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores, burdened by a
monstrous debt load taken on when it went private in 1987,
said its current financial forecasts indicate that it will be
in violation of its bank-credit agreements during this year
and added that it doesn't believe it will be able to win
needed waivers unless it can reduce its debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Southland said that its auditors have
included a paragraph in their year-end review of its
financial statements noting that there is "substantial doubt"
about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p>The massive loss and the gloomy projections, the most
ominous signs yet of the company's worsening financial
position, follow Southland's disclosure last week that it has
agreed to sell 75% of its equity to its Japanese licensees
for $400 million. However, that agreement is contingent on
Southland's convincing holders of about $1.8 billion in
public debt to swap their debentures for stock and
zero-coupon bonds. The proposal already has met resistance
from bondholders, who don't want to give up cash interest
payments and who fret that the founding Thompson family is
retaining too much of the company at their expense.</p>
<p>Southland's bleak predictions may also be a warning to
bondholders balking at the proposed restructuring. But Jack
Ackerman of Bond Review Co., whose investment advisory
company is working with Southland bondholders, said the
holders still will want to know why they can't receive at
least some cash interest on new debt issues.</p>
<p>"Our preference is to do an out-of-bankruptcy settlement
if possible," he said, although some bondholders have said
they wouldn't mind working out a plan under court
supervision. Although Southland isn't expected to officially
propose its debt-swap offer until later this month, the
bondholders already have formed a steering committee and hope
to meet with company officials soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company said it received waivers from
certain bank covenants from its senior bank group, which is
owed about $924 million, but the agreement requires it to
submit a restructuring plan before May 31 and complete the
restructuring by Dec. 1.</p>
<p>While a Southland spokeswoman conceded that the company's
financial position is troubled, she said the company is
confident that it has begun work on a restructuring plan
"well in advance" of a crisis.</p>
<p>In disclosing its quarterly loss, Southland said it
decided to take the huge write-off of good will, or the
amount over the fair value of the assets acquired in the
company's $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out, after it and its
auditor, Deloitte & Touche, evaluated the convenience store
industry and tried to determine the true value of that good
will. As the good will initially was to be amortized over 40
years, the write-off eliminates a $26 million-a-year non-cash
expense and won't affect Southland's liquidity or its tax
liabilities.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Southland had a net
loss of $37 million. Revenue for the latest fourth quarter
was $2.06 billion, up 4.4% from $1.97 billion in the 1988
period. The company said that, on an inflation-adjusted
basis, its merchandise sales at stores open more than a year
fell, as did its gasoline profits. The company attributed the
decline in gasoline profits to its fewer stores owned and to
a drop in gas sales per store, a possible reflection of its
decision to sell a brand-name gas and to abandon its policy
of offering the cheapest price on the block.</p>
<p>For the year, Southland had a loss of $1.32 billion,
compared with a loss of $285.2 million in 1988. In addition
to the write-off of good will, the company had a $56 million
charge related to a debt swap a year ago and $69.4 million in
income from discontinued operations. The year-ago results
also included $69 million in profit from discontinued
operations.</p>
<p>Revenue for the year was $8.35 billion, up 4.5% from $7.99
billion in 1988.</p>
