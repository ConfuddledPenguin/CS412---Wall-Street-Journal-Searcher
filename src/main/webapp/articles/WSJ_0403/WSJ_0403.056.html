	<p class="article-leader">Federal drug policy director William Bennett speaking in
Washington on March 16:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In my neighborhood, middle- to upperclass Chevy Chase,
Maryland, if we see someone selling drugs in the street,
there is no debate about what to do. We call 911. We do not
convene a seminar on root causes. We expect action, and if we
do not get it, we raise hell. I think that is a natural,
civilized and appropriate reaction. And I don't believe for a
moment that a single parent in southeast Washington should
behave any differently. Equality is the oldest promise of
America. Parents -- all law-abiding citizens -- have an equal
right to expect security regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>We have been examining the problem of poverty for decades.
Fine. Let it go on. Let it go on smarter. But today the
primary need is not to study residents of poor neighborhoods,
but to help them. How? By doing unto them what we do for
ourselves. I'm asking that we start treating these drug
benighted neighborhoods as if we lived there, not as if they
were some laboratory for social policy.</p>
