	<p class="article-leader">Heritage Media Corp. said it entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire the 43% of New York-based POP Radio
Corp. that it doesn't already own.
   The Dallas owner of television and radio stations said the
agreement calls for holders of each common share outstanding
of POP Radio to receive $20.50. If the transaction is
completed after July 31, POP Radio shareholders also will
receive an additional amount equal to interest accruing at
the rate of 10% a year on $20.50 a share from Aug. 1 to the
date of completion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although a special committee of POP Radio board members
has approved the transaction, the merger is subject to
approval by POP Radio shareholders, the receipt of financing
and certain regulatory approvals and third party consents,
Heritage said. POP Radio provides customized radio programs
for broadcast in retail outlets.</p>
