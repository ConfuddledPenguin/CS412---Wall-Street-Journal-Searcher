	<p class="article-leader">Who says small stocks don't do well these days?
   Certainly not Jonathan Steinberg, publisher and editor in
chief of Individual Investor magazine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He won this column's stock-picking contest for March with
a recommendation for American Film Technologies Inc., a
leading colorizer of movies that recently turned profitable.
The price of the company's shares surged 33% during the
month.</p>
<p>Thanks to that big gain, the contests' investment pros, as
a group, scored a 7.7% advance for the month -- handily
beating both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (up 3%) and a
randomly selected "dartboard portfolio" (down 1%). In 18
monthly outings, the dart throwers have prevailed five times,
and the pros have won 13 times.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Steinberg is back with another small-company pick:
Image Entertainment Inc., which makes laser video disks.
Never heard of them? You will, Mr. Steinberg declares.</p>
<p>A laser video disk is to a videotape as a compact disk is
to a phonograph record. With a laser video disk player, film
buffs can enjoy sharper, more vivid pictures. Though there
are only some 400,000 laser disk players in the U.S., Mr.
Steinberg thinks the number will increase rapidly, now that
some sell for less than $500.</p>
<p>Image Entertainment, based in Chatsworth, Calif., has a
lot to gain, Mr. Steinberg figures. The company makes the
disks, not the players. It has about 60% of the market, he
says, with exclusive rights to distribute more than 1,500
movies.</p>
<p>Image Entertainment reported sales of just $7.8 million
for the third quarter ended Dec. 31. Its earnings were
smaller yet -- less than a penny a share. But its $109,882
profit for the quarter represents a break into black ink,
after losses during its start-up period. The shares (of which
there are 133 million) sell for about 69 cents apiece, and
Mr. Steinberg recommends buying at any price up to 85 cents
per share.</p>
<p>Stocks that sell for less than $1 a share -- so-called
penny stocks -- can be highly volatile. And they're often
more expensive to trade than higher-priced stocks. But Mr.
Steinberg doesn't think Image Entertainment is a stock to
trade in and out of: He thinks it's a stock to hold for two
years or more.</p>
<p>Also back for another try is money manager Remy Fisher, a
vice president with the New York money-management firm J. &
W. Seligman & Co., who is making her third appearance in the
contest. Her recommendation at the end of January to buy
Airborne Freight Corp. is the best pick of the past six
months. Borne aloft by strong earnings, it was up 38% as of
last Friday.</p>
<p>Ms. Fisher's latest pick is Santa Fe Pacific Corp. She
likes Santa Fe because it is re-emphasizing its railroad
business, selling off portions of its oil and gas, mining and
real estate interests.</p>
<p>Ms. Fisher says railroads will benefit from a "better
labor-bargaining climate" in the next couple of years. She
especially likes Santa Fe because about a third of the
freight it carries is wheat, and because it emphasizes
"intermodal" (combination road and rail) transportation. She
expects a bumper crop of wheat, and heavy demand for it from
foreign buyers. As for intermodal transport, she says it is
finally becoming cost-competitive with straight trucking.</p>
<p>Santa Fe should earn $1 a share this year (60 cents of it
from the railroad), Ms. Fisher thinks. For next year she
predicts earnings of $1.75 a share, with the railroad
contributing a full dollar of that.</p>
<p>Ms. Fisher thinks the operations Santa Fe is shedding have
a value of about $16 a share. The railroad currently has a
value of $15 a share, she reckons, but will grow in value as
results improve. She would buy the stock, which closed
yesterday at $19.25 a share, at prices up to $24.</p>
<p>Joining the contest this month are two experienced money
managers, Thomas S. Mench of Leshner Financial Services Inc.
in Cincinnati and William Kapner of Justin Asset Management
Inc. in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Mr. Mench, who is a portfolio manager for three mutual
funds, endorses QMS Inc., a Mobile, Ala., manufacturer of
computer printers and imaging systems. "The earnings trend
for the company is extremely strong," he says. He expects it
to earn $1.25 a share this fiscal year (ending in September),
up from 96 cents last year. In the year ending September 1991
he expects $1.45.</p>
<p>A stock whose earnings are growing that fast deserves to
sell for 15 to 16 times earnings, Mr. Mench figures. So he
concludes that QMS will deserve a $19-to-$20 share price by
the end of this year. That's considerably above yesterday's
closing price of $13.50. Mr. Mench considers the stock a buy
at as much as $16.</p>
<p>Mr. Kapner suggests MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2
long-distance telephone company. At yesterday's closing price
of $36.50, MCI sells for only about 12 times the earnings Mr.
Kapner expects for 1990 -- an average multiple. But it
deserves better, Mr. Kapner says.</p>
<p>"We think rapid earnings growth at a 20-25% {annual} pace
is sustainable," he says. "MCI spent the bulk of the 1980s
pouring money into building a long-distance network. The
network is largely built. So the incremental cost of bringing
on new customers or having new volume go through those lines
is very small."</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Kapner says, MCI (with 12% of the market)
is continuing to nibble market share away from AT&T (which
has 65%). He would buy MCI shares at prices up to $45 or so.</p>
<p>For April, the pros are up against a dartboard portfolio
consisting of Caesars World Inc., Floating Point Systems
Inc., Longview Fibre Co. and Putnam Diversified Premium
Income Trust.</p>
