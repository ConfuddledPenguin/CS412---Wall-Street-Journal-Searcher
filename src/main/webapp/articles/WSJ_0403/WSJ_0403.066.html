	<h3>Travel: Cruise Operators Hope Marketing Push Will Put the Wind Back in Their Sales</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">After a decade of clear sailing, the North American cruise
industry is entering some rough waters.
   Saddled with too many boats and too few bookings,
cruise-line operators in Florida and travel agents across the
country are scrambling for passengers. The lines have slashed
fares as much as 60%, and they're rushing out new products,
such as on-board fitness programs and "theme cruises." Even
advertising budgets, to which many small operators have
traditionally paid scant attention, are being beefed up to
spread the word that a cruise -- at least in the industry's
eyes -- is still a bargain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pyrotechnics, however, can't mask what's been a tough
season for the boat business. "It's been a bloodbath," says
Donald Nagel, president of Wide World of Cruises Inc., a
travel agency in Coral Springs, Fla. Larry Fishkin, whose
Miami-based travel agency specializes in cruises, adds: "It's
not unusual to save someone $800 to $1,000 on a seven-day
cruise, and I don't see things getting any better."</p>
<p>Doubts about the future are something new for the
industry. But by most accounts, the cruise business has
simply become a victim of its own success. In the 1980s, such
innovations as three-day and four-day cruises and "cruises to
nowhere" helped spur passenger growth of about 11% a year.
Over the past four years, Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines
Inc., the industry leader, saw its revenue almost triple and
its earnings almost double.</p>
<p>Those kinds of numbers have drawn more players into the
pool. Club Mediterranee Inc., for instance, whose popular,
all-inclusive vacation formula has been mimicked by the
cruise industry, recently launched its first ship, the
425-passenger Club Med 1, for seven-night cruises. This year
alone, 15 new ships with 12,000 berths -- a 16% increase from
1989 -- are expected to enter the North American market,
which includes Alaska, Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico.</p>
<p>All these boats, however, are plowing into consumer
concerns about a sluggish economy. Many vacationers,
according to travel agents, appear increasingly reluctant to
part with a few thousand bucks -- paid in advance -- to
paddle around the Caribbean for a few days.</p>
<p>But the steep discounts are helping to put passengers on
board. And shorter cruises, though subject to discounting,
haven't been hurt as much as longer cruises. The industry
also is quick to note that it's still only scratching the
surface of the vacation market: Each year, only 5% of the
some 70 million Americans on vacation who can afford to take
a cruise do so.</p>
<p>"That huge potential for cruising explains why so many
ships are being built," says Jay J. Lewis, president of
MarketScope Inc., a cruise consulting firm in Miami. "The
problem is that little or nothing has been done to spur
demand along with it."</p>
<p>Indeed, the industry's own surveys show that, even in the
best of times, the main reason most consumers have never
taken a cruise is the pricey image. The upfront cost of a
seven-day Caribbean cruise can easily run $1,600 per person
(including air fare).</p>
<p>"People see the price and say, `I don't want to spend that
much on a vacation,'" says Mitchell J. Schlesinger, senior
vice president of marketing for Costa Cruises Inc., Miami, a
unit of Italy's Costa Crociere S.p.A. But if people were to
total what they spend on other types of vacations, he says,
they would find that their costs approximate that of a
cruise.</p>
<p>Outwardly, cruise executives preach patience in educating
prospective passengers about the value of a cruise. In
reality, patience has gone out the porthole this season in
the weekly scramble to fill berths. Getting people up the
gangplank means more than just the price of a ticket: Each
passenger also spends an average of $50 a day on gifts,
drinks and gambling -- most of it on board.</p>
<p>Thus, discounting -- lots of it -- has fast become the
norm in an industry where executives grimace at the word. The
industry has always done some discounting, but this winter,
newspapers and magazines across the country have carried ads
with headlines such as "Reduced for Quick Sail," "2nd Person
Cruises Free," and "Life Saving Rates."</p>
<p>Small and large operators alike have been forced to cut
prices. Miami-based Dolphin Cruise, with two ships, this year
eliminated the top fares it normally can charge at the height
of the winter season. Carnival, meanwhile, is offering for as
little as $599 seven-day cruises that regularly start at
$1,175 (without air fare).</p>
<p>The fare cuts, while serving the immediate purpose of
getting some passengers -- any passengers -- on board, may
come back to haunt the cruise business, some analysts say.
They cite the example of rebates in the auto industry. "The
American consumer loves a deal," says Mr. Lewis at
MarketScope. "With big discounts, the cruise industry is
training consumers that the price isn't going to go up, it
can only go down."</p>
<p>Ship operators acknowledge the damage they might be doing.
With the cruise industry accounting for only 5% of the
nation's $100 billion-a-year leisure business, "It's foolish
to be trying to steal what little market share there is from
one another," says Mickey Arison, president of Carnival. "If
{discounting} continues, it will eventually hurt us."</p>
<p>The industry hopes to wean itself from discounting by
spreading the word that cruising is reasonably priced and
"more relaxing" than a comparable land-based vacation. "We've
yet to do a good enough job of raising awareness of
cruising's value," says Costa's Mr. Schlesinger. To get the
word out, he says, the industry will boost ad spending 20%
this year to $300 million.</p>
<p>Television promises to get a big piece of the pie as the
ubiquitous Carnival is joined by other big lines. Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd., for instance, has weighed in with its
sultry "Royal Caribbean Vacation" spots -- which don't even
mention the word "cruise." The company says it wants to
position itself as a "vacation" option, not a "cruise"
option, emphasize the range of available activities, stand
out in the crowded cruise market and compete with other types
of vacations options. Commercials for Princess Cruises Inc.,
a unit of Britain's Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation
Co., feature actor Gavin MacLeod, whose stint as the captain
on the popular "Love Boat" TV series is credited with
boosting cruising's popularity.</p>
<p>Cruise lines are hoping new programs and itineraries will
not only attract new passengers but also bring repeat
business by offering previous customers a new experience. For
example, many operators now offer fitness programs --
complete with low-calorie meals. And to compete with the
likes of Walt Disney World during the peak summer season, all
the major lines are pushing programs for couples traveling
with children.</p>
<p>"Theme cruises," another growing trend, are being designed
around everything from rock 'n' roll to chocolate. Royal
Caribbean, which sponsors a tournament on the senior
professional golf tour and bills itself as "the official
cruise line of the PGA," offers a seven-day cruise in which
passengers debark to play golf in several different ports.</p>
