	<p class="article-leader">Was the Japanese stock market a speculative bubble that
finally burst?
   For years, many American and other Western analysts warned
that the highflying Tokyo stock market was headed for a fall.
Despite a seemingly unending string of record peaks, they
said, Tokyo share prices weren't justified by basic stock
analysis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese brokers and investors in turn argued that
Westerners didn't understand the Tokyo market. Standard
fundamental tools used to determine stock prices didn't
matter, they claimed: Measures such as share prices relative
to earnings per share, dividend yields, and the relationship
between share prices and bond yields were all irrelevant.</p>
<p>Price-earnings ratios in Tokyo soared above 60, compared
with about 13 in New York and 12.5 in Frankfurt, West
Germany. Japanese stocks yielded an average 0.5% a share,
compared with six to seven times that for U.S. stocks.
Investors in Tokyo didn't care. They kept racking up gains as
Japanese stocks continued to soar.</p>
<p>No more.</p>
<p>So far this year, the Tokyo stock market is off 28%,
dragged down by the combination of soaring Japanese interest
rates, a sinking yen, rising inflation pressures, and a
general loss of confidence in the same bureaucrats who are
credited with engineering Japan's post-World War II financial
and economic miracle.</p>
<p>For an American investor, the results are even bleaker.
Add on the yen's 10% fall against the dollar this year, and a
U.S. investor in Japanese shares has watched his portfolio
collapse by a staggering 38%.</p>
<p>"This is the real thing. It's over," Felix W. Zulauf,
chief investment officer at Clariden Bank in Zurich, said.
"The bubble has burst."</p>
<p>On Monday, the first trading day of the new fiscal year in
Japan, the Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks plunged 1978.38
points, or 6.6%, to close at 28002.07, the second-biggest
decline ever.</p>
<p>But despite the debacle in the Tokyo stock market this
year, analysts cited some justification for the big rise in
Japanese shares, only that it got out of hand.</p>
<p>Barton M. Biggs, a managing director at Morgan Stanley &
Co., points to Japan's strong economic growth and corporate
profits, low inflation and declining interest rates -- once
as low as 3%. "When you have that combination, plus a strong
currency, your stock market should sell at a very high
valuation level," he said.</p>
<p>"The Tokyo market sold at 50 times earnings. I can make a
case that maybe it should have," Mr. Biggs said. "But when it
got to 60 times, it got beyond where it should have."</p>
<p>David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said Japanese share prices were
propelled until recently by the convergence of three powerful
forces: a world-wide slump in commodity prices in the 1980s,
an expansionist Japanese monetary policy designed to support
the weak dollar from late 1986 through the end of 1988, and
the unusual nature of the Japanese stock market, where many
companies own one another's stock.</p>
<p>The commodity-price slump helped fuel a huge Japanese
trade surplus. Japan's easy-money policy meant lower interest
rates and helped create a huge pool of Japanese funds that
had to be invested somewhere. At the same time,
cross-shareholdings among Japanese corporations limited the
number of shares outstanding that were available to be bought
and sold.</p>
<p>If there was a speculative bubble, most analysts put its
beginnings last fall, when Tokyo share prices started racing
higher, driven by a crescendo of investor demand. At the
time, big institutional investors cited the prospects of
strong economic growth in Japan, high recurring corporate
profits, and a flood of new money coming into the Tokyo
market from pension funds and government-bond redemptions.</p>
<p>On the back of these fundamentals, the Tokyo stock market
soared, establishing 13 records and rising 4.8% in December,
and closing the year at a record 38915.87.</p>
<p>But some analysts see real evidence of frenzied
speculation in Tokyo that went far beyond what economic
fundamentals would justify. "Certainly there was a bubble,"
said Akira Suzuki, an executive director at Morgan Stanley in
Tokyo. He ascribed the Tokyo stock market's strong run-up
since 1985 to heavy flows of money into Japanese stocks, not
to fundamentals. Specifically, he noted that tokkin funds,
which are used by Japanese corporations to invest spare cash
and pension money, grew from their start in 1985 to 50
trillion yen ($316.1 billion), and that nearly all of this
money was plowed into the stock market. "There were no
criteria to justify the investment," he said; rather, the
money was just looking for a home.</p>
<p>Another pivotal support of the Japanese stock market
during its heyday was land prices. The property market in
Japan has zoomed in recent years, with prices in Tokyo
doubling since 1986. Encouraged by these increases, Japanese
banks lent money against property. The money often ended up
in the stock market. And money made in the stock market was
used to buy property. Thus, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Suzuki and
others argue, a speculative bubble developed. "It was
self-created," he said.</p>
<p>For a while, many Western analysts have been almost
gleeful in watching the decline of the Tokyo stock market
that began early this year. Many believed the Japanese were
getting their just desserts. But, "It's no longer funny,"
George L. Noble, an international portfolio manager at
Fidelity Management & Research Co. in Boston, said. "I'm
worried. I don't know how they are going to get out of this."</p>
<p>This pessimism has spread to Tokyo. At the beginning of
last year, Japan's giant Nomura Securities Co. and other
firms "traveled around the world, projecting 43000 on the
Nikkei for 1990," Clariden Bank's Mr. Zulauf said. "Now, the
same people are sending faxes forecasting 24000."</p>
<p>Already, foreign brokers are moving to capitalize on the
new mood. Richard Greer, managing director of Baring
Securities Ltd. in Tokyo, is adding staff in his research
department. He figures to sell more stock to Japanese
investors newly and finally interested in investing along
fundamental lines.</p>
<p>Some Japanese investors, apparently, have stopped making
big bets based mostly on prospective earnings and companies'
assets -- primarily land and stockholdings in other companies
-- the way they often did in the past. "We are now in a
market that is looking for earnings results, not earnings
prospects," Bruce D. Johnson, a Baring director, said.</p>
<p>So far, the plunge in Tokyo stocks hasn't spread to major
stock markets outside Japan, at least not in a big way.
Traders attribute yesterday's lackluster performance on the
New York Stock Exchange to worries about whether Japanese
institutions might begin unloading American stocks to cover
losses in Tokyo.</p>
<p>But to date, the U.S. market seems to attribute Tokyo's
problems to "indigenous Japanese factors," said Laszlo
Birinyi of Birinyi Associates Inc., a New York-based
financial consulting firm. Analysts added that the
combination of a strong dollar and an unexpectedly resilient
U.S. economy are keeping both foreign and U.S. investors in
American stocks.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Birinyi said: "Historically, the
relationships between markets isn't nearly as strong as a lot
of people thought it was. A lot of the appeal of the coupling
theory occurred when all the markets were going up. But over
time, the relationship between world markets isn't as strong
as many people have felt."</p>
<p>Mr. Birinyi pointed out that yesterday, when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average declined 6.76 points, was the third Monday
of the past six that the U.S. market essentially shook off
big drops in Tokyo. Others were Feb. 26, when Dow rose 38.29
points after the Nikkei fell 1569.1 points, and March 19,
when the Dow rose 14.41, compared with a 1353.2 fall in the
Nikkei.</p>
<p>The differing results are "certainly not what one would
have thought a year ago," he said.</p>
<p>Even though many Western analysts have finally been proven
correct on the Tokyo market, "You would have lost 15 fortunes
before you were right," Mr. Birinyi conceded. "You would have
been financially dead if you had shorted Japan the first time
price-earnings ratios rose above 30."</p>
<p>Now many analysts see the Tokyo market stabilizing near
its current levels, maybe for a month or two, before resuming
its downward spiral.</p>
<p>Anthony E. Gibbons, a futures trader at the U.S. unit of
Daiwa Securities Co. in New York, said Japanese shares could
even experience a bear-market rally, with the Nikkei shooting
back up to the low 30000 range before falling again.</p>
<p>But beyond that, pessimism reigns. "Once a bubble bursts,
you don't go to normal {stock} valuation levels, but instead
overshoot," Mr. Zulauf of Clariden Bank said. He projects the
Tokyo market will tumble to the low 20000 level on the Nikkei
"later this year or early in 1991."</p>
<p>He said that Japanese inflation is at the highest it has
been in eight years, and that interest rates will rise more,
because Japan's central bank will have little choice but to
tighten monetary policy.</p>
<p>Mr. Biggs of Morgan Stanley said the Nikkei index could
fall to as low as 17000 or 18000. "It wouldn't be in the
least bit unprecedented for a market to drop 40% to 50% after
a 25-year bull run, which is what the Japanese market has
had," he said. He noted that indexes of the U.S. stock market
fell that much in 1973-74, some even more.</p>
<p>"The legend of a bullet-proof Japan, efficient and
invincible, is dissipating," Mr. Biggs told clients last
week. "Meanwhile, Japan Inc., probably the greatest cartel of
the post-war world, is falling apart amidst the squabbling"
between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan about
whether to raise interest rates to defend the sagging yen.</p>
<p>Mr. Biggs was one of those who predicted that the Tokyo
market would fall. "But two years early," he conceded. "It's
hard to differentiate between being early and wrong."</p>
