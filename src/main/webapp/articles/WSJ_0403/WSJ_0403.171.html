	<p class="article-leader">First Constitution Finance Corp., New Haven, Conn., said
it raised its real-estate related loan-loss reserves for the
first quarter by $37 million and will post a "significant"
loss for the period.
   The savings institution also announced that Walter R.
Miller Jr., 55 years old, will step down as president and
chief executive officer of the parent company and its First
Constitution Bank unit. Mr. Miller will be succeeded by John
Crawford, 45, a director, as an interim president and chief
executive of the parent and the unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Miller said he believed it was time "to bring in
someone with a different perspective" to steer the bank.</p>
<p>First Constitution estimated that its nonperforming loans
in the first quarter amounted to about $200 million, up from
about $100 million at Dec. 31.</p>
<p>With the addition of the $37 million in reserves, the
total loan-loss reserve will increase to about $80 million.</p>
<p>First Constitution, which has $2.4 billion of assets,
didn't estimate its expected first-quarter loss. A year
earlier, it earned $5.1 million, or 47 cents a share.</p>
