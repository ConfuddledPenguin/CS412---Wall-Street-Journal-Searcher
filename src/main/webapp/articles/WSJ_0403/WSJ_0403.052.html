	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision withdrew a
rule that hampered savings-and-loan owners that tried to
market other financial products to their S&L customers.
   The Association of Thrift Holding Companies, a trade
group, filed a suit challenging the rule in December, when it
went into effect. The association told the federal court in
Washington it will withdraw the suit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regulation was intended to insure privacy of
depositors, the thrift office said. It required
thrift-holding companies to obtain written permission from
S&L customers before the parent company or other affiliate
could mail marketing for other financial services, such as
insurance, to those customers. The association argued that
the rule was cumbersome and unworkable, and that bank-holding
companies don't face the same restriction.</p>
<p>The regulation, said Patrick Forte, president of the trade
group, "has damaged the attractiveness of some thrifts to
potential buyers."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the thrift office said the regulators are
likely to propose a new regulation that replaces the old in
some form. "We are still committed to the principle outlined
in the regulation as far as disclosing customer records," he
said. "We did find there was good reason to take another look
at the implementation of the regulation."</p>
