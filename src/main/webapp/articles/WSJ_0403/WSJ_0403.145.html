	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Royal Bank of Canada sold its 50% stake in its
Australian bank for 200 million Australian dollars (US$150
million) in the first part of a A$3.4 billion merger (US$2.6
billion) between a big bank and an insurance concern in
Australia.
   Royal Bank retreated from full-service retail banking in
Australia by selling its half-interest in National Mutual
Royal Bank Ltd. to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, or
ANZ. National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd.,
Royal Bank's joint-venture partner in the 130-branch bank,
also sold its stake to ANZ. Total proceeds for the
transactions were A$400 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale of the bank was the first leg of a proposed
merger in which ANZ will pay A$3.4 billion for a 51% stake in
National Mutual Life. The merger, if accepted by shareholders
and policyholders and approved by the Australian government,
would create Australia's largest financial-services concern,
said David Trude, analyst at First Boston Corp. It also would
protect ANZ from a raid by its competitors, who are mainly
Westpac Banking Corp. and National Australia Bank Ltd., of
Melbourne, he said. ANZ said the merged entity will have A$91
billion of group assets and A$39 billion under management.</p>
<p>National Mutual Life policyholders will be asked to
approve the merger with ANZ on May 29, with combined
operations set to begin on Oct. 1. Following the merger, ANZ
will ask its shareholders to change its name to ANZ-NM
Banking and Insurance Group Ltd. ANZ is a large banking and
financial services group and National Mutual Life is
Australia's second-largest life insurance concern. Both are
based in Melbourne.</p>
<p>In a statement, Australian government Treasurer Paul
Keating said he approved in principal ANZ's acquisition of
National Mutual Royal Bank, but said he would consider
various policy issues regarding the union of ANZ and National
Mutual Life. It is likely that Mr. Keating will approve the
ANZ-National Mutual Life merger because the two concerns
don't operate to a significant degree in the same businesses,
Mr. Trude said.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating said that in the event the merger doesn't go
ahead, ownership of National Mutual Royal Bank will revert to
National Mutual Life.</p>
<p>Although National Mutual Royal Bank "exceeded
expectations" on performance, Toronto-based Royal Bank said
it sold its interest in the bank to accommodate its
joint-venture partner.</p>
<p>"I would think that they are happy to get out of there,"
said First Boston's Mr. Trude, adding that foreign banks
created when the Australian government granted 16 new banking
licenses in 1985 have faced tough competition from Australian
domestic banks. He noted that National Mutual Royal Bank was
one of the more successful new entrants in the deregulated
Australian banking sector.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Royal Bank said the bank had invested
about A$140 million of capital in National Mutual Royal Bank.
He said Royal Bank's focus in recent years has been to
withdraw from retail full-service banking outside of Canada,
except in parts of the Caribbean, and to focus instead on
corporate banking.</p>
