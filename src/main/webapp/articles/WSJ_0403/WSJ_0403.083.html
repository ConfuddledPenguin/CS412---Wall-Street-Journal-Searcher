	<p class="article-leader">In my first year at Harvard Law School I was surprised to
see one of my professors wearing lace-up, leather work boots
to class. I could think of no good reason for a Harvard law
professor to be wearing the cumbersome, awkward-looking boots
that were disparagingly known as "longhorns" back on the farm
in Idaho.
   Those boots reminded me of the physical and economic
difficulty of life in rural America: They were disturbing
symbols of a past I was trying desperately to escape. The
smooth, clean surface of the professor's boots suggested that
he had no experience with farming, or any other demanding
physical labor for that matter. So why would this prosperous
and cultured man wear the boots that I would have been
ashamed to wear in public?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An informed classmate explained to me that the boots were
a statement about the professor's left-wing ideological
orientation: "Like a Mao suit, they are intended to convey
the message that he has thrown his lot in with the common
man."</p>
<p>Solidarity with the common man as against his capitalist
oppressors is of course a familiar posture in the
universities. But it would shock my left-leaning,
boot-wearing professor's self-image to hear that the common
man has at least as much contempt for intellectuals as for
the rich. Just who is really suffering from false
consciousness?</p>
<p>The school's most notorious left-wing professor, Duncan
Kennedy, proposed some years ago in a locally famous article
that all Harvard law professors regularly change places with
the school's janitors. I interviewed 20 of the law school's
custodial staff to find out what they thought of the idea,
something Mr. Kennedy had evidently never bothered to do.
Here are a few of their replies:</p>
<p>-- "The only thing worse than scrubbing a toilet would be
to have to pretend to be some fancy-pants, egghead college
professor, usually some dweeby guy who could never do
anything well but read books."</p>
<p>-- "Tell this professor of yours to mind his own damn
business] The world would be a lot better off without some
screwed up, overeducated college brat telling the rest of us
how to live our lives."</p>
<p>-- "I might be a janitor, but does this guy really think
we are stupid enough to believe him? It's all showbiz
blabbermouth crap] If he were really that concerned about the
work we do, he'd offer to come help us once in a while,
rather than just talking it up to the world. I haven't seen
any law professor busting his butt to come buff floors with
me. Most probably don't know how] We can't even get them to
empty their own trash] I'd settle for that, rather than some
highfalutin, job swapping idea that this guy knows would
never happen in a million years. Maybe he can sell that line
to a bunch of fruitcake students, but he sure can't fool us
janitors."</p>
<p>Then I sprang Mr. Kennedy's proposal on my grandfather, an
elementary school janitor. He was offended by two assumptions
behind the job-switching plan: that there was something bad
about being a janitor and that there was something good about
being a Harvard Law School professor. It made no difference
to him that Mr. Kennedy claimed to be his advocate. Few
intellectuals, according to my grandfather, could ever speak
for the common man, because few have ever lived his life. (I
never told my grandfather about the Jaguar that Duncan
Kennedy drives to school. I didn't have to.)</p>
<p>Left-wing intellectuals would have us believe that
material wealth is the only power operating in society. But
the perceived knowledge and prestige that emanate from
academia are a form of power too. The leftism that pervades
universities furtively molds the minds of tomorrow's
citizens. In the same way that society turns to the market to
acquire wealth, society turns to academia to acquire another
putative social good: educational prestige. And as spokesmen
for capitalism are reluctant to concede that wealth confers
power, apologists for academia are reluctant to concede that
educational prestige confers power too. If educational
prestige were as easily transferable as wealth, one wonders
whether academics would be the zealous redistributionists
they are today.</p>
<p>The fact is that the arguments made by the leftist
professors at places like Harvard Law School are made not so
much for the benefit of the common man as for themselves.
Turgid left-wing theories propounded from ivory towers are
rarely heard in the factories and in the fields, and when
they are heard, they are never understood. These theories are
not published for the common man to read, but to win
notoriety, tenure and chaired professorships from other
academics.</p>
<p>Lenin quipped that "(w)henever the cause of the people is
entrusted to professors, it is lost." Lenin was as much an
intellectual as the professors he ridiculed, perhaps even
more. That may be why he failed to capture the relationship
between common man and intellectual as well as that more
authentic populist philosopher, Hank Williams Jr.:</p>
<p>You build me up,</p>
<p>To build you up</p>
<p>Only to let me down . . .</p>
