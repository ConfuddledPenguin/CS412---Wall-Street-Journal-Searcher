	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden criticized a Pennsylvania anti-takeover
proposal that would restrict shareholder proxy fights against
management.
   Mr. Breeden, in his first public comment on the state
proposal, said the measure would "virtually eliminate
shareholders' well-established right to replace a board of
directors." Entrenched directors, he said, "could run a
company into the ground" with shareholders powerless to
react.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Pennsylvania proposal, which is awaiting final action
by the legislature, would toughen the state's anti-takeover
law to require holders who acquire voting rights for over 20%
of a company's shares to offer to buy all the company's
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Supporters say the change would enhance what would become
the nation's stiffest state regulation against hostile
takeovers. Opponents say that under the measure the sponsor
of a proxy resolution trying to line up votes could be forced
to buy the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden indicated that the SEC would intervene if the
final legislation approved by the state interfered with
federal proxy regulations. "We will not hesitate to seek to
enforce federal interests," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden spoke at a meeting of the Council of
Institutional Investors, a group made up mostly of
public-employee pension funds with assets totaling more than
$300 billion.</p>
<p>Council members, including the statewide pension funds
from California, Florida, Connecticut and Massachusetts,
approved a statement saying they would review their holdings
in Pennsylvania companies if the proposed measure was
adopted.</p>
