	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
outlined quick, narrow legislation that would undercut one of
the Bush administration's most compelling arguments for
quickly confirming Timothy Ryan as top thrift regulator.
   Mr. Ryan, a Washington labor and pension lawyer, was
nominated last month to be director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision. The Senate Banking Committee approved the
nomination by an 11-10 vote last week and sent it to the full
Senate for consideration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some senators have complained that Mr. Ryan lacks
financial experience, but the administration has argued that
the nominee must be confirmed quickly. A federal court ruling
could bring the savings-and-loan restructuring to a halt
unless the Senate promptly confirms a new director for the
thrift office. An appeals court stay has put the federal
court ruling on hold until April 11.</p>
<p>Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have drafted a
one-page bill that would give the president the authority to
appoint a temporary replacement. Sen. Donald Riegle (D.,
Mich.) outlined the proposal as one option that may be
pursued. The bill would allow the president to name a
temporary director under procedures that would pass muster
with the court, and the administration would have more time
to seek another candidate for the full five-year term.</p>
<p>The administration also has argued that Mr. Ryan's
financial background isn't as important as his record as an
able administrator and strong enforcer during his time with
the Labor Department. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has
asked the Senate to "trust his judgment" on his selection of
Mr. Ryan and continued calling on senators to push for the
nominee.</p>
<p>The narrow basis of the court case hanging over the thrift
bailout was that Danny Wall, director of the thrift office
until late February, wasn't approved for his post under
constitutional provisions. When he resigned, therefore, the
administration didn't have standing under the Vacancies Act
to appoint a temporary replacement.</p>
<p>A floor vote this week appears likely, the administration
and Senate Democrats said. The legislation that Sen. Riegle
discussed wouldn't necessarily have to be approved before the
vote, a committee staff member said, as long as senators knew
the bill was in the offing.</p>
<p>Sen. Riegle has hammered away that Mr. Ryan lacks the
background necessary for the job at a time of crisis in the
thrift industry. In a speech to the Independent Bankers
Association of America, Sen. Riegle said he was unhappy about
the choice for the "single most important financial position
today," adding that he believes Mr. Ryan would be unqualified
to be chief executive officer of any of the small banks the
trade group represents.</p>
<p>Disclosures during the weekend that Mr. Ryan briefly tried
marijuana and cocaine in the early 1970s won't help the
nominee but aren't likely to be as important a factor in the
Senate deliberations, congressional sources said.</p>
