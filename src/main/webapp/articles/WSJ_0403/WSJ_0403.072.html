	<p class="article-leader">A FUNDING PINCH hampers states' jobless-pay operations.
   A $121 million fiscal 1990 shortfall in federal funds,
caused by a rising unemployment-compensation workload and
Gramm-Rudman budget cuts, is forcing Indiana to slash costs
20%. Claims offices were trimmed to 26 from 43, with 100 of
740 workers laid off. Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and
Texas also plan office closings, layoffs or reduced hours,
mainly for temporary help used for peaks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New Hampshire, where the workload has nearly tripled
from last year, the staff is down 7%. Officials "steal"
claims workers from other jobs, such as tax collecting; but
waits in claims lines, usually a half hour, still climb to
three to five hours. California shelves control efforts that
try to avoid wrong payments or nonpayments.</p>
<p>A House bill would add funding, but the Bush
administration opposes release of more of the
employer-financed funds, short of "a dire emergency."</p>
<p>THE WHITE HOUSE favors naming a rail-labor emergency
board.</p>
<p>Officials say the president would form the panel to avert
a nationwide railroad strike. Railroads and 12 negotiating
unions both want the board, and the National Mediation Board
probably will declare a bargaining impasse soon. The next
step is the emergency panel. Health costs, soaring over 15% a
year, are the biggest issue; the railroads want worker $100
deductibles and $2,000 out-of-pocket medical-bill limits
raised.</p>
<p>The roads seek work-crew cuts, freedom to assign work as
they wish and the right to contract out more, among
work-rules changes; they also want to trim wages, unions say.
The unions want 5% pay boosts every six months, job
protection in short-line sales and an end to some
subcontracting.</p>
<p>CHILD-LABOR POLICE will step up enforcement still more.</p>
<p>New sweeps of employers are planned -- one before school
is out and another in the fall. A recent three-day blitz
found 9,300 violations including kids working late or long
hours, instead of the 7,000 estimated at the time, officials
say. Fines will reach $2.5 million, rather than $1.8 million.
Violations will be announced in bunches, starting today.</p>
<p>The Labor Department's Employment Standards and
Occupational Safety and Health agencies will sign an
agreement this week for investigators at both agencies to
swap data on child-labor and safety violations. "Sweat-shop"
investigators often find chained rear doors, for instance, a
danger in a fire. Similar plans are afoot with state
worker-safety agencies.</p>
<p>In a labor pinch, "some employers cut legal corners" by
filling low-level jobs with children, says William Brooks,
the Employment Standards chief.</p>
<p>NO FOLLOW-THROUGH? Though 73% of 491 employers polled by
placement consultant Right Associates expect a skilled-labor
shortage, three-fourths don't have a plan to keep most-needed
workers. Of those who foresee problems, 44% predict higher
training costs and 43% expect increased pay and benefits to
recruit new workers.</p>
<p>THE MINIMUM WAGE rose to $3.80 an hour Sunday, but the
Labor Department estimates that employers can pay the new
short-term $3.35 training wage for as many as 3.7 million
teen-agers. But finding youths at the minimum already is
tough. "You're not going to find people . . . to work for a
sub-minimum," says Arby's.</p>
<p>THE SILVER LINING? The business of finding jobs for fired
executives will climb 15% to 17% this year, topping $400
million, the Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms
says. Lenders, builders and developers, reeling from weak
real-estate markets, contribute to the placement surge.</p>
<p>AUTO WORKER RETIREES plump for automatic cost-of-living
adjustments to their pensions. They lobby for the UAW to make
retiree COLAs a priority bargaining item. Canadian auto
workers won the benefit from auto makers in 1987. But only 3%
of all U.S. pensioners have such COLAs, the Pension Rights
Center says.</p>
<p>GETTING TOUGHER: Firms push harder to share health costs
with workers.</p>
<p>Fully 45% of 1,943 employers surveyed by consultant Foster
Higgins in 1989 required employee contributions to premiums
for individual coverage, up from 39% in 1988, and 75%
required contributions for dependents, compared with 69%.
Employee shares had held steady since '86, declining slightly
in '87 and '88. Average worker contributions eased a bit in
1989, to $23.03 for employee-only and $69.46 for dependent
coverage.</p>
<p>But more than a fourth of the companies plan to increase
the employee contribution this year. Individual deductibles
of more than $100 were required by 60% of employers and
family deductibles of more than $300 by 49%, up from 51% and
42%, respectively, in 1988.</p>
<p>About 72% of employers required workers to pay part of
hospital charges, compared with 66% in 1988.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: Nearly half of 3,500 workers surveyed by
consultant Wyatt Co. said their managers are too tolerant of
poor employee performance -- not by the surveyed workers, of
course. . . . The Tribune Co., its New York Daily News locked
in a bitter labor-contract battle, cancels a congressional
reception in Washington after unions threaten to picket the
party. . . . Record revenue trimmed the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. 1989 deficit 30% to $1 billion; but the PBGC
faces possible loss of a Supreme Court case to LTV, which has
$2 billion in underfunded plans.</p>
