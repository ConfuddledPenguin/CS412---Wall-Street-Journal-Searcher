	<p class="article-leader">The House Government Operations commerce subcommittee says
the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacks sufficient agents
to investigate savings-and-loan fraud.
   Accusing the Bush administration of failing to match its
rhetoric with manpower, the subcommittee is relying on an
authoritative source: an FBI study.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.), chairman of the House panel,
has asked the House Appropriations Committee to allocate $75
million for S&L enforcement for fiscal 1991, which begins
Oct. 1. The administration has requested $50 million.</p>
<p>In a study of 59 field offices last year, the FBI
concluded it needed 425 new agents to begin work on some
2,300 "inactive," or unaddressed, fraud and embezzlement
cases involving savings and loans. In December, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh announced the deployment of 202
agents -- less than half of what the FBI wanted.</p>
<p>"It just looks like there isn't a serious-enough effort in
the Justice Department," said Mr. Barnard. The allocation he
requested includes money for additional federal prosecutors,
which Mr. Barnard contends are also badly needed.</p>
<p>In testimony before the committee, Edward Dennis Jr.,
chief of the Justice Department's criminal division,
responded testily to Mr. Barnard's call for more agents and
prosecutors. He conceded, however, that "numerous districts
have a significant unaddressed backlog" of S&L cases.</p>
<p>Thomas Jones, the FBI's chief of white-collar crime
investigations, said that staffing decisions were made
jointly with the Justice Department. "We can always use more
people; the more we have, certainly the better job we can
do," he said.</p>
<p>An Appropriations Committee staff member observed that the
administration is "primarily focused, as is Congress, on
drugs. Getting them to focus on bank fraud is going to take
some time."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, S&L fraud cases, which burgeoned in the 1980s
after the Reagan administration deregulated the industry,
continue to increase. The reason: As regulators close more
failed S&Ls, they frequently uncover criminal allegations and
refer the cases to the Justice Department.</p>

<p>MANUEL NORIEGA'S LAWYERS put the U.S. invasion of Panama
on trial.</p>
<p>At a hearing in U.S. district court in Miami, attorneys
for the deposed Panamanian dictator argued that the U.S.
invasion of Panama was so outrageous that drug-racketeering
charges against him must be dismissed.</p>
<p>Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general and
human-rights activist, was subpoenaed by the defense and
testified that obtaining an accurate death count in Panama
has proven impossible. However, he said, some estimates range
from 3,000 to 6,000 dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark recalled that during a fact-finding visit he
made to Panama in January shortly after the invasion, he
learned of "a great deal of death and destruction." He said a
child playing in a cemetery led him to a mass grave, and an
independent human-rights commission heard testimony of
incidents in which body bags were packed with several corpses
each.</p>
<p>Frank Rubino, one of Mr. Noriega's attorneys, played a
videotape assembled from television news footage that
detailed the death and destruction.</p>
<p>But a key witness that Noriega's attorneys had hoped to
call wasn't in court yesterday. Prosecutors persuaded U.S.
District Judge William M. Hoeveler to quash a defense
subpoena for Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Mr. Rubino said he had hoped to extract testimony from
the military chief about the invasion and to compel him to
produce documents detailing U.S. pre-invasion estimates of
casualties and the sophisticated weaponry used.</p>
<p>Federal courts have held that the way a defendant is
apprehended is irrelevant to a court's jurisdiction and right
to try him. However, Mr. Noriega's lawyers argue the Noriega
case is unique and the U.S. government's conduct in Panama is
so "immoral and illegal" that the charges have to be thrown
out. The defense lawyers implored Judge Hoeveler to "tread
new territory" and "go where no man has ever gone before."</p>
<p>Mr. Rubino cited several cases, including that of
Francisco Toscanino, a federal drug defendant who claimed he
was beaten and abducted in Uruguay, tortured in Brazil by his
captors, and spirited to the U.S. to stand trial. The Second
Circuit Court of Appeals said that if Mr. Toscanino's claims,
including alleged U.S. involvement in his ordeal, were true,
they were so shocking to the court's conscience that Mr.
Toscanino had to be freed.</p>
<p>Judge Hoeveler hasn't yet ruled on whether to hold an
evidentiary hearing on the issue of the invasion. Federal
prosecutors contend that no such hearing is necessary.</p>
<p>They note, among other things, that even if the assertions
about the brutality are true -- which they dispute -- the
case against Mr. Noriega can proceed.</p>

<p>CALIFORNIA COURT RULES that a Nomura unit can arbitrate
age-bias claim.</p>
<p>Employers contend arbitration is more efficient and less
costly than court trials for employment-discrimination cases.
However, some plaintiffs' lawyers argue that employers simply
are trying to avoid the big damage verdicts that juries
sometimes hand out in wrongful termination and other job-bias
cases.</p>
<p>In this case, J. Robert Hall, a 60-year-old stockbroker in
Nomura Securities International's San Francisco office, had
sued the firm in state court, claiming he was fired because
of his age and previous medical problems. Nomura is a unit of
Japan's Nomura Securities Co. The suit was brought under a
California statute barring job discrimination because of age
or physical handicap.</p>
<p>However a state appeals court in San Francisco agreed with
Nomura's contention that Mr. Hall was bound by an arbitration
provision in his employment contract and by New York Stock
Exchange rules requiring arbitration of employment disputes.
Citing federal legislation favoring arbitration agreements,
the court last week rejected Mr. Hall's contention that he
wasn't bound by the contractual clause because his claim was
brought under state law.</p>
<p>Robert A. Dolinko, an attorney in the San Franciso office
of Epstein Becker Stromberg & Green, counsel for Nomura,
termed the ruling "significant," saying it's the first time a
California appeals court has compelled arbitration of an
employment-discrimination claim under such circumstances.</p>
<p>James Paul Green, a San Francisco attorney who represented
Mr. Hall, said he will appeal the ruling. "We are not pleased
with the decision, to put it quietly," he said.</p>

<p>QUICK ACTION UNLIKELY on key proposals of a federal-courts
study panel.</p>
<p>The Federal Courts Study Committee, authorized by Congress
and appointed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, yesterday
issued more than 100 recommendations after 15 months of
debate. But the proposals will get a mixed reception,
according to lawmakers and congressional aides.</p>
<p>The quickest action is likely to be on legislation
carrying as many as two dozen "technical" proposals, such as
eliminating a special court created in 1971 to handle cases
arising from oil and gas price controls, or allowing parties
in civil suits to agree to have their case heard by a
magistrate. This "housekeeping" bill, as one congressional
aide called it, will be worked out in meetings among the four
legislators who were part of the 15-member panel: Sen. Howell
Heflin (D., Ala.), Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), Rep.
Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.), and Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R.,
Calif.).</p>
<p>Another possibility for action this year, although far
more controversial, is legislation creating more federal
judgeships. Two years ago, the federal courts asked for some
75 additional slots, and the need is now closer to 100. No
bills have been introduced yet, and proposals for more
judgeships typically involve much partisan negotiation among
Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>Other proposals may languish for some time. Among the
controversial proposals are putting all tax appeals in a
special tax court; eliminating from the federal courts suits
between citizens of different states over state law issues;
abolishing mandatory minimum prison sentences passed by
Congress in some recent criminal laws; and limiting the kinds
of drug prosecutions that may be filed in federal court, in
order to keep more cases in state court.</p>
<p>The study committee watered down its earlier call, in a
draft, for Congress to abolish the Sentencing Commission and
the federal criminal sentencing guidelines it issued, to
which many federal judges object.</p>
<p>The study committee went out of existence yesterday after
issuing the report at a Supreme Court ceremony.</p>
<p>But the committee's director, William Slate, is expected
to set up a lobbying effort for the proposals through a
Washington nonprofit group called the Council for Court
Excellence.</p>

<p>ARBITRATION GROUP takes alternative dispute resolution to
Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>East Germany's Chamber of Foreign Trade and its Court of
Arbitration have agreed to recommend the use of American
Arbitration Association techniques to help resolve disputes
betweem U.S. and East German businesses. The Austrian Federal
Economic Chamber has agreed to allow Vienna to serve as a
neutral site for resolving those contract disputes.</p>
<p>AAA President Robert Coulson says U.S. companies had
pushed for the neutral site, because they were leery of the
existing East German arbitration system that is dominated by
government personnel. Mr. Coulson added that the
association's role is to promote these kinds of agreements
and then to educate foreign arbitrators about American
dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Already, similar agreements are in effect with chambers of
commerce of Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the
Soviet Union.</p>

<p>ANTI-MARCOS PROTESTERS plan to greet Imelda Marcos at
court today.</p>
<p>Opening arguments are slated in her racketeering case in
Manhattan federal court. Opponents of Mrs. Marcos and her
late husband, Ferdinand, the ousted president of the
Philippines, kept a low profile during jury selection for the
case; they feared they would be accused of trying to sway
prospective jurors.</p>
<p>Filipinos opposing the 20-year Marcos regime began
soliciting volunteers at the Philippines consulate in
Manhattan last week during a forum on the trial. Fliers were
circulated asking people to help monitor the case and
demonstrate at the courthouse.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marcos is accused of stealing more than $160 million
from the Philippines and illegally concealing most of the
money through real-estate investments in Manhattan.</p>
