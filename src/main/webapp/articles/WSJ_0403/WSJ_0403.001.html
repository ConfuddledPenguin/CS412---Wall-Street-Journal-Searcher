	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Tenneco Inc. said its Midwestern Gas
Transmission pipeline unit has started offering open-access
service under a "blanket" certificate from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. The unit's open access had been
limited to local distribution companies and intrastate
pipelines; the new certificate extends open access to end
users and other interstate pipelines.</p>
