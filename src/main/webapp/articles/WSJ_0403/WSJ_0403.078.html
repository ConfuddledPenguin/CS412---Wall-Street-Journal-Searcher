	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors sold stocks on concerns about bad
first-quarter earnings, the plunging Tokyo stock market, and
the belief that interest rates won't fall anytime soon.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.76 to 2700.45.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 1.24 to 338.70. For
the quarter, the S&P 500 finished down 3% on a total return
basis. Volume totaled 124,360,000 shares on the New York
Stock Exchange, where declining issues swamped advancers
1,122 to 434.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist for Morgan Stanley,
boosted the cash position in his model all-stock portfolio to
10% yesterday from 3%. "I felt that sentiment had driven the
market," he explained. "To move up the next leg, the market
needs help from interest rates. While I am optimistic, I
wanted hope and reason to be in better balance."</p>
<p>Mr. Wien's colleague, Barton Biggs, chairman of Morgan
Stanley Asset Management, said he recently raised cash levels
to 15% in his global portfolio, reducing the equity portion
to 45% from 55%. The bond portion remains at 40%.</p>
<p>Mr. Biggs said he is concerned about the decline in Tokyo
shares. "I think a 32% decline in the biggest market in the
world is an event," he said. "I think our market is de-linked
from ordinary performance in Japan, but not from a financial
panic." He added that margin calls and credit scares in Japan
could be two factors that create selling in other markets.</p>
<p>"I think there are going to be aftershocks; it will ripple
through all markets," said Mr. Biggs, who added that he wants
more cash on hand to hunt for values if stock markets tumble.</p>
<p>Disappointing earnings news from Network Equipment
Technologies sent the stock plummeting 6 3/8 to 23 1/2 on 1.8
million shares. The company said it expects revenue and net
income for the March quarter to be significantly lower than
it had anticipated, with per-share earnings possibly falling
short of 33 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>The first quarter's dividend activity confirms the dismal
state of corporate profits, according to Arnold Kaufman,
editor of Standard & Poor's "Outlook" newsletter.</p>
<p>"There has been a downtrend in corporate profits since
1988 and dividends are starting to reflect that very
clearly," said Mr. Kaufman.</p>
<p>S&P, surveying 7,557 companies, found that dividend
increases shrank to 414 in the first quarter, down 20.5% from
the same period a year earlier. The number of dividend
decreases and omissions rose 64.5% to 79 in the first quarter
from the same period in 1989.</p>
<p>"We are not going to see an improvement through the rest
of this year," Mr. Kaufman predicted.</p>
<p>Several of the put warrants on Tokyo Nikkei stock index
topped the most active list on the American Stock Exchange
yesterday. Nikkei put warrants allow investors to bet on a
decline in the Tokyo stock market. The Denmark issue closed
up 3/4 to 11 3/4; the January 1993 Salomon Brothers issue
rose 5/8 to 10 7/8; a February 1993 issue from Salomon gained
7/8 to 11 3/4, and the Bankers Trust issue rose 1 to 25 3/4.</p>
<p>American General dropped 1 7/8 to 36 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares. Torchmark withdrew its bid to acquire the company for
$50 a share in cash and stock and said it would wage a proxy
fight for five board seats. American General turned down
Torchmark's slate, however, contending it wasn't submitted by
a deadline for nominations set in its bylaws. Torchmark rose
1/4 to 45 1/2.</p>
<p>Pfizer slipped 1 5/8 to 59 on 1.1 million shares. Barron's
magazine reported that the company faces a potentially "huge
liability" if it loses a lawsuit, filed by a recipient of one
of the heart valves once made by its Shiley unit. The suit
seeks damages for anxiety resulting from the news of problems
with the valve. The report included several documents
indicating that the company was aware of potential hazards
with the valve but urged doctors not to publicize them.</p>
<p>Fleet/Norstar Financial Group fell 5/8 to 21 1/4 on 1.8
million shares after disclosing that it is being examined by
federal and state banking regulators. The company said it
might have to boost its loan-loss reserve, based on their
findings.</p>
<p>Unocal rose 1 3/4 to 33 5/8 on 1.3 million shares amid
continued speculation that British Petroleum may be
interested in taking over the company. BP declined comment;
the stock fell 1 3/4 to 63 as a sell-off on the London market
hurt shares of British companies traded in the U.S.</p>
<p>Motorola rose 1 to 66 after a federal court stayed an
injunction against sales of the company's flagship
microprocessor. The ban had been imposed as part of the
court's decision in a patent-infringement case between
Motorola and Hitachi.</p>
<p>Digital Equipment gained 3/8 to 77 1/8 in advance of
today's expected introduction of new engineering
workstations. Compaq Computer, which unveiled a high-speed
controller for use in computer networks, climbed 2 1/8 to 97
5/8.</p>
<p>UAL fell 7/8 to 161 1/8 amid continuing discussions about
a buy-out bid from the three major unions at its United
Airlines unit. The group is offering cash and securities
valued at $185 a share.</p>
<p>Wheelabrator Technologies rose 1 1/2 to 35. Waste
Management agreed to increase its stake in the company to 55%
from 22% through a stock swap. Waste Management rose 1/8 to
34 1/4.</p>
<p>Mortgage & Realty Trust rose 5/8 to 8 1/8 after reaching a
preliminary agreement with a group of lenders for $425
million in financing. Shares of the trust dropped sharply
last month after it didn't make a payment on a note issue;
Mortgage & Realty said the funding would permit it to make
that payment, among other things.</p>
<p>General Development dropped 1 7/8 to 4. The company said
it hadn't been able to reach agreement on a $60 million
credit facility over the weekend and it is considering a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, along with alternatives.</p>
<p>West Point-Pepperell fell 1 1/4 to 37. The company that is
holding investor William Farley's stake in Pepperell
defaulted on $796 million in bank debt and on interest
payments due on $705 million in subordinated debt.</p>
<p>Hotel Investors Corp. fell 1/2 to 4 1/2 after reporting a
$60.3 million loss for 1989, reflecting a $55.8 million
provision for losses on its hotel and gaming properties and
goodwill. The company also cut back an agreed-upon sale of
some of its hotel interests.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.38
to 359.37. Volume on the American Stock Exchange was
14,490,000. There were 405 issues declining and 165
advancing.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema rose 1/2 to 11 3/8. The company said its
new movie, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," grossed
approximately $25.4 million in its first weekend at the box
office.</p>
