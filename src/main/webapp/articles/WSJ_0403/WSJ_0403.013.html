	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Ivan F. Boesky will be a free man again
tomorrow, when he is expected to be released from the
Brooklyn, N.Y., halfway house where he is completing a
three-year prison term.
   Mr. Boesky, once one of the most powerful figures on Wall
Street, stunned the financial world in November 1986 with the
announcement that he had agreed to plead guilty to one felony
and had settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges by
paying a record $100 million. He was sentenced to prison in
December 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Boesky's agreement to cooperate with the government
led to the most sweeping investigations ever of the
securities industry and insider trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky began his term in a minimum security prison in
Lompoc, Calif., in March 1987. He was released to the
Brooklyn halfway house last December, but because the
facility is overcrowded, he has been permitted to live at
home and has had to check in regularly. With time off for
good behavior, he has served little more than two years of
his sentence.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky is expected to make his courtroom debut as a
government witness as soon as next month, when the government
will try its case against John A. Mulheren Jr., an
arbitrager. Mr. Mulheren was charged with taking stock
positions for Mr. Boesky to conceal the true ownership of the
securities, a tactic known as stock "parking." A lawyer for
Mr. Boesky said the former stock speculator didn't know what
he would next do for a living. But the attorney said Mr.
Boesky isn't likely to return to the financial industry.</p>
