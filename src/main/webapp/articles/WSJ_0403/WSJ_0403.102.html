	<p class="article-leader">New York -- A trio of amiable comedies has opened
off-Broadway over the past few weeks, and none is as charming
as Craig Lucas's whimsical love story "Prelude to a Kiss."
   The plot draws from that satisfying structure of the film
romances of the '30s and '40s: Boy gets girl, boy loses girl,
boy regains girl. Peter (Alec Baldwin) and Rita (Mary-Louise
Parker) are made for each other and they know it, with that
captivating self-assurance that accompanies love at first
sight.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The spell is cast from the moment they -- and we -- meet
at a raucous Manhattan party, which throbs on around them as
they tentatively flirt with each other. Love may make fools
of every mortal, but Mr. Lucas's humor is never foolish. It
is wise to the ways of love, and pokes gentle fun at Peter
and Rita as they zestfully pursue each other. Theirs is a
whirlwind romance, and the scenes chronicling their courtship
proceed just as fast and furiously; before Act I is over,
Rita and Peter are married.</p>
<p>Or are they? Peter is convinced that the compliant woman
with him isn't the perky Rita he loves. He's right. This is
more than just the nervous delusion of a man having second
thoughts about marriage. During the wedding, an elderly
gate-crasher (Barnard Hughes) has kissed the bride and
exchanged souls with her. And so the sweet humor of Act I
gives way to nuttier comedy in the second half as Peter, who
is determined to get "Rita" back, devises a scheme with the
old man, possessed by Rita's spirit, to accomplish that task.</p>
<p>Mr. Baldwin, "The Hunt for Red October's" younger
heartthrob, displays an appealing vulnerability as the ardent
lover and then the determined husband. Ms. Parker makes a
sexy, sassy Rita, a character whose charm becomes even more
beguiling when locked in the portly, mustachioed body of Mr.
Hughes.</p>
<p>Director Norman Rene, Mr. Lucas's usual collaborator,
keeps the show going at a gallop. In lieu of elaborate sets,
Mr. Rene decorates the stage with an assortment of silent
extras who help set the mood. In the party scene where Peter
and Rita meet, for example, a -- shall we say? -- amorous
couple is rolling around on the floor. In the bar where Rita
works, a transvestite lurks in the background. What little
scenery there is slides efficiently in and out of the wings.</p>
<p>"Prelude to a Kiss," now at the Circle Rep, is the
38-year-old Mr. Lucas's eighth play and possibly his biggest
hit. It moves to Broadway May 1. Ms. Parker and Mr. Hughes
are going along, but Timothy Hutton will replace Mr. Baldwin.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>If "Prelude to a Kiss" celebrates fools for love, fools in
a half-dozen other guises are toasted in "Feast of Fools,"
Geoff Hoyle's one-man show at the Westside Arts Theater.
"Does not the Fool turn the world upside down?" Mr. Hoyle
asks during the prologue. The answer is a happy yes -- and in
the fine-tuned mayhem of "Feast," which Mr. Hoyle also wrote,
it is glorious chaos.</p>
<p>The title comes from a medieval French New Year's
tradition in which, for one day, the bishop turned his
cathedral over to a fool and the sacred gave way to the
profane. It's the medieval equivalent of letting Eddie Murphy
loose in the White House for 24 hours. Mr. Hoyle re-enacts
the 12th-century spoof with a gleeful vulgarity, employing a
chair as a recalcitrant donkey and making the obvious joke
with a salami.</p>
<p>Of the eight skits, the two funniest are in mime. The
first, which ends Act I, is about two waiters -- one an
obsequious snob and the other a lackadaisical slob. Mr. Hoyle
hams up both parts to the hilt, disappearing behind one side
of a screen with his nose in the air and a crisp snap of the
napkin over his forearm and reappearing on the other side
with shuffle and a slump. Timing is everything. The
Jekyll-and-Hyde transformations keep getting faster and
faster until finally the waiters are chasing themselves
around the screen and Mr. Hoyle is changing character every
couple of seconds.</p>
<p>My other favorite is the vaudevillian skit that concludes
the show. Mr. Hoyle, dressed as a nerd -- in horn-rimmed
glasses, baggy pants and an absolutely straight face --
throws himself into a spirited fox trot -- on all three of
his legs. His merry triple-legged four-step is a hoot.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoyle, an expatriate Englishman who makes his home in
San Francisco, has performed extensively in the Bay area and
at Lincoln Center's Serious Fun] Festival. He writes in a
program note that in "Feast" he has attempted "a selective
exploration and celebration of the Western European branch of
the Fool's family." Huh? That's just a fancy-schmanzy way of
explaining that good jokes never die.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Speaking of old jokes, the Manhattan Theater Club has
revived Terrence McNally's 1973 "Bad Habits." It's a pair of
one-acters about two very different sanitariums, one run on
bacchanalian principles, the other dedicated to a Hitlerian
school of therapy.</p>
<p>With its gags about, among other things, S&M,
homosexuality and transvestism, "Bad Habits" must have seemed
a bit naughty to its original audiences. By now, it's all
rather old hat.</p>
<p>That said, Kate Nelligan displays her comic gifts as a
loud-mouthed, lascivious patient in Act I and a lovesick
Brunhilde of a nurse in Act II. Faith Prince is amusing as,
first, a suburbanite who's trying to cure herself of the urge
to murder her husband, and then as a sex-starved RN. Nathan
Lane, who sparkled last year as a flamboyant opera-loving
queen in Mr. McNally's "The Lisbon Traviata," grows rather
tiresomely campy here as a Dr. Feelgood in Act I and as a
degenerate patient in Act II.</p>
<p>Since writing "Bad Habits," Mr. McNally has developed into
a comic playwright with serious purpose, as his subsequent
"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" and "The Lisbon
Traviata" show. He would be better off working on new
material rather than wasting his time tinkering with the more
trivial successes of the past, however jovial. It could
become a bad habit.</p>
