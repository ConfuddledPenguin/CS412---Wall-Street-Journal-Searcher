	<p class="article-leader">M.A. Hanna Co., Cleveland, said it expects to establish a
reserve of as much as $11.5 million against first-quarter
earnings. The charge comes as a result of the bankruptcy-law
filing of a customer of a coal company in which Hanna owns a
50% stake.
   A spokeswoman at the natural resources and rubber products
concern said the $11.5 million reflects about half of the
amount the customer owes the coal company, Colowyo Coal Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the 1989 first quarter Hanna earned $13.8 million, or
54 cents a share, on revenue of $256.4 million.</p>
<p>Hanna said the charge stems from last week's
bankruptcy-law filing by a customer of Colowyo. Colowyo
supplies coal to Colorado-Ute Electrical Association, which
owed Colowyo about $23 million for coal shipped during March,
Hanna said.</p>
<p>Colorado-Ute filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Hanna said it remains confident about Colowyo's prospects.</p>
