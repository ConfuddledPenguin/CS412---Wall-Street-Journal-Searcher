	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Stephen Sander ushers a
visitor into the meditation room of his home. A panorama of
the city's waterfront fills a picture window. Soothing sitar
music plays in the background. His wife pours herbal tea.
   It was here, in the middle of his daily yoga session, that
he decided to give away property worth $170 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was a seed that blossomed in my mind," says Mr.
Sander, who had spent the last two decades building his
real-estate empire. After allowing for mortgages, his gift
nets out to about $110 million. "I wish," he says now, "that
other people could see how good it feels to give away money."</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Mr. Sander signed over to a charitable
trust the titles of 23 luxury apartment buildings he owned in
downtown Vancouver and its suburbs. The trust, Consciousness
International Foundation, will use its rental income to,
among other things, finance projects in the Third World. Mr.
Sander says he expects the money to start flowing in October.</p>
<p>All this may sound a bit more 1960s than 1990s. But Mr.
Sander is no flower child. Born Sukhwant Singh, he grew up in
a refugee camp in India. His family had fled Moslem-ruled
Pakistan in the mid-1940s when the British partitioned India.
He spent seven years living on the streets of Delhi, herding
cows for $8 a month. He slept with the animals. "I can still
remember waking up with ticks all over me," he says with a
shudder.</p>
<p>He emigrated to Canada in 1960 for a job teaching physical
education in Nova Scotia. In the early 1970s, he made his way
to Vancouver, where he struck his first real-estate deal. He
bought a house outside of town for $4,000, then traded it for
25 acres that he later sold for $25,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Sander promptly quit teaching and changed his name to
Stephen Sander. He says he picked the name because it sounded
vaguely British, and it seemed to allay the fears of business
contacts who appeared nervous about dealing with a foreigner.</p>
<p>He picked a good time to change careers. Vancouver real
estate has been on an extended roll for the past two decades,
in part because of an influx of well-to-do Asians. Immigrants
from Hong Kong alone pumped some $2.5 billion into the city's
real-estate market last year.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, Mr. Sander has gained a
reputation as one of Vancouver's shrewdest and most
successful real-estate investors. Buying properties was a
passion. "I could smell blood," he recalls. "I enjoyed the
chase and the kill."</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, he had accumulated a portfolio he
valued at $70 million -- "solid gold stuff," according to a
local real-estate lawyer. Yet the landlord lived more simply
than many of his tenants. He drove a battered Volkswagen
Beetle, dressed in old clothes while shopping for properties
and worked "out of my hat," as he puts it.</p>
<p>He currently drives a 10-year-old Jaguar. His home is a
modest three-bedroom overlooking the city's skyline. There
are no tennis courts, no pool and no servants. But there is a
room loaded with Nautilus equipment for his wife, who was his
aerobics instructor before they wed in 1985. The
abstemiousness was, in part, a ploy. "If people don't know
you're rich, they let their guard down and don't try to cheat
you as fast," he says.</p>
<p>Despite his success, he felt something was missing. "I'd
make a $20 million deal and come home and say, `This is
insane. I need something for my soul,'" says Mr. Sander, who
is trim, athletic and only slightly gray at the temples. He
is a Sikh, but he says religion didn't play any part in his
decision.</p>
<p>"I'll leave behind a real legacy, not just a lot of real
estate," he says. "I can't see any better way to use my
fortune. I'm 55, and making a lot of money isn't doing
anything for me anymore. I'm keeping enough to be
comfortable."</p>
<p>Under the terms establishing the trust, neither Mr. Sander
nor his family will be left penniless. Some $5.5 million will
go to his seven children from two previous marriages. He, his
third wife, Nancy, and their four-year-old daughter will get
$500,000, their three-bedroom home and three cars. "We can
live comfortably on $40,000 a year," Mr. Sander says, adding
that he has left the real-estate business for good.</p>
<p>His decision stunned many of his business associates. "He
is best known for his appetite for buying apartment houses,
not giving them away," says Michael Keenan, a local
real-estate agent. "It's unbelievable," says Kelly Heed, an
agent who has done business with Mr. Sander since 1971. Mr.
Sander, he says, was "tight as hell."</p>
<p>Each year, Mr. Sander's Consciousness International
Foundation will grant a dozen or so "cosmic consciousness
awards" of $25,000 to $30,000 to humanitarians in the Third
World. Mr. Sander and a board of his choosing will name the
recipients, whom he has dubbed "lighthouses," and channel
additional funds for local projects such as hospitals.</p>
<p>This year, Consciousness International expects to dispense
about $1 million. One of its first projects is an orphanage
in Sri Lanka. Within three years, the foundation plans to
distribute about $5 million a year. Its $170 million in
assets apparently makes it the second largest charitable
trust in Canada, after one established by the Bronfman family
of Montreal, whose members are heirs to the Seagram liquor
fortune.</p>
<p>Not everyone in Vancouver is applauding Mr. Sander,
though. Just before turning his buildings over to the
foundation, he increased apartment rents -- by as much as
30%. "Charity begins at home," grumbles Patricia Waddell, an
out-of-work interior designer who rents a one-bedroom unit in
one of his buildings. Vancouver's Mayor Gordon Campbell
echoes her sentiments, saying the philanthropist should have
chosen to back local charities. "I haven't heard much about
him," the mayor says, "and I have no intention of contacting
or congratulating him."</p>
<p>Mr. Sander shrugs off the criticisms as "sour grapes."
Furthermore, he says, the rents for units in foundation-owned
buildings are in line with those of the city's other luxury
apartment houses.</p>
<p>In any event, Mr. Sander has plenty of other concerns
these days. Word of his foundation has drawn hundreds of
would-be "lighthouses." One New Jersey man flew here last
month and begged for 15 minutes of his time. Mr. Sander
reluctantly granted an audience. "He shut the door of my
office," he recalls, "and started asking me for tips on local
real-estate bargains."</p>
<p>Now that he has discovered philanthropy, Mr. Sander is
determined to share the secret. At press conferences across
Canada, he has been urging his wealthy brethren to unburden
themselves of their riches. "Lots of people made money in the
1980s," he says. "We want to make it fashionable to give away
money."</p>
<p>But so far, Mr. Sander's vision of himself as the Pied
Piper of philanthropy hasn't quite jelled. "Stephen is a bit
disappointed he hasn't become the catalyst he hoped,"
concedes his lawyer, Douglas Scarlett.</p>
<p>But that hasn't dissuaded him. He says he has his eye on
just the man to follow in his footsteps: Donald Trump. "How
many billions does he need?" he says, pledging to carry his
message to the New York billionaire. "He'll find it's very
relieving to give it away," says Mr. Sander.</p>
