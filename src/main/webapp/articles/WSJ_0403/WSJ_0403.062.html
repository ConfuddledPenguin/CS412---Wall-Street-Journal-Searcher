	<p class="article-leader">How's this for an eye-catching new ad campaign for United
Airlines? "Most of our passengers get there alive."
   How about a meaner, tougher AT&T? "We're tired of taking
your crap. If we fold, you'll have no damn phones."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These and other catchy "ads" -- some too outrageous to be
repeated in this newspaper -- can be seen in "Crazy People,"
a new film that spoofs the advertising business. The satire
is so biting, in fact, that it is already stirring up
controversy. ABC and CBS have declined to run some
commercials for the film, worried they might give free
exposure to products and at the same time offend some of the
networks' biggest advertisers. United Airlines, for example,
has already made it clear that it isn't amused.</p>
<p>In the Paramount Pictures release, which makes its debut
next week, Dudley Moore plays an ad agency executive who
declares he's sick of lying all the time. He decides to try
"truth in advertising" and comes up with a half-dozen wacky
ad campaigns that inspire his associates to commit him to a
sanitarium. But the ads are mistakenly printed in newspapers,
magazines and posters on the sides of buses -- and are hugely
successful. Suddenly, Mr. Moore is the hottest thing on
Madison Avenue.</p>
<p>While advertisers typically pay big bucks to get their
products placed in Hollywood films, Paramount is giving a
dozen or so the dubious honor of getting their products
spoofed for free. While there are ads for fictitious brands,
the writers decided the best way to get laughs would be to
use the real thing: products such as Porsche and Jaguar, John
Hancock life insurance and Metamucil.</p>
<p>The unit of Paramount Communications Inc. didn't ask any
of the advertisers for permission to take their names in
vain. But the company says it doesn't have any legal concerns
because it believes the movie is protected as parody. "The
comedy parodies many companies and their products, including
our own," says Barry London, one of two motion picture group
presidents at the studio. "It's all in the spirit of great
fun."</p>
<p>"Crazy People" does poke fun at movie ads with a campaign
for a fictitious Paramount movie called "The Freak." The fake
ad promises not only to scare people but to mess them up for
life.</p>
<p>But while the movie takes on some big corporate guns,
Paramount did decide there were some it didn't want to tangle
with. An ad about the pleasures of smoking, for example,
features a made-up brand, Amalfi cigarettes, with the copy:
"Cancer? Perhaps. Flavor? For Sure]" Says writer Mitch
Markowitz: "Cigarette companies are very litigious, and the
studio didn't want to upset any of them."</p>
<p>Responses to "Crazy People" vary. A spokeswoman for ad
agency Fallon McElligott, which handles Porsche, says, "I
guess our only response for now is that it's in sort of bad
taste." The ad for Jaguar draws a startled laugh from Peter
Geer of the auto maker's agency Geer DuBois. Mr. Geer says
he'd rather stay out of this one. The satirical ads for
Porsche and Jaguar feature ad copy -- unprintable here --
promising immediate sexual gratification to men who buy the
cars.</p>
<p>At UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit, a spokesman says the
company doesn't think the reference is funny and has asked if
it can preview the movie before its opening. Paramount
marketing chief Arthur Cohen says they can pay $7 in a movie
theater just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble Co. distanced itself from the movie's
Metamucil ad, which goes right to the gut: "It will help you
go to the toilet. . . . If you don't use it you'll get cancer
and die." A spokeswoman says the ad claims in "Crazy People"
for Metamucil and other products are "outlandish, and we
think consumers will recognize this." She adds, however, that
the company "would be concerned if consumers take these
claims seriously."</p>
<p>A spokesman for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is more
magnanimous. "Large companies have to carry a sense of humor
with them at times," he says. "If I had to sum up our
reaction, I'd say we're not amused, but we're not offended
either." He adds that "AT&T has suspected from time to time
that a few of our copywriters have frequented insane
asylums."</p>
<p>Some of the TV networks clearly aren't amused. While
Paramount and its ad agency, WPP Group PLC's Ogilvy & Mather
unit, have gotten commercials for "Crazy People" cleared by
NBC and the Fox network, ABC and CBS have declined to run
some.</p>
<p>Matthew Margo, vice president of program practices at CBS,
says the network asked for revisions that included dropping
all the brand names. CBS was concerned, Mr. Margo says, about
"the prolific exposure of various brands which we think is
gratuitous and inappropriate." Moreover, he adds, "in a
couple of instances, the clients of this network are
portrayed in a way that might be troubling to them."</p>
<p>Harvey Dzodin, ABC's vice president for commercial
clearances, also asked for revised ads that avoided brand
names or used some of the fictitious ones in the movie. "We
generally try not to have secondary mentions of products in
advertising for other products," says Mr. Dzodin. Equally
important, he says, "we'd be crazy people to allow false
disparagements of advertisers that are some of the major
corporations in this country."</p>
<p>Paramount's marketing chief, Mr. Cohen, says the studio
has decided not to bother running any ads on CBS, but has
agreed to cut some brand names out of commercials at ABC's
request. For instance, the studio cut the John Hancock name
out of a clip featuring an ad for life insurance with the
copy, "We know you love him, but if he happens to die we'll
give you two Mercedes and a summer home, too. "</p>

<p>Arby's Kinder Campaign</p>
<p>Arby's Inc. is shelving its burger-bashing ad strategy in
favor of a kinder campaign spotlighting its own product line.</p>
<p>Arby's new campaign, which begins airing this week and
will run throughout most of the year, features jingles that
pitch the chain's roast beef and other sandwiches. The ads
were developed by W.B. Doner & Co., Baltimore.</p>
<p>The new ads are strikingly different from past ads that
poked fun at hamburger chains, Arby's big rivals. One ad last
year, for example, showed a washed-up clown lamenting his
distaste for burgers while talking on the phone with his
agent. The clown looked a bit like Ronald McDonald.</p>
<p>Frank Belatti, Arby's new president and chief operating
officer, says past ads didn't focus on Arby's food in part
because there weren't a lot of products to boast about. But
now Arby's has an expanded menu, he says. "We have a product
line that deserves to be romanced a bit."</p>
<p>Mr. Belatti said Arby's will spend about $48 million on
advertising this year, up sharply from last year's
expenditure of $35 million. The increased ad budget largely
results from the continued national expansion of the Arby's
franchise.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>MEXICO ACCOUNT: The Mexican Government Office of Tourism
yesterday named Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, a unit of
Saatchi & Saatchi Co., to handle its estimated $15 million
account. The decision to keep the account at Saatchi, which
has handled the business for many years, followed numerous
reviews of many ad agencies. After a review that ended in
December, Bozell was tapped to handle the account. But new
top executives were then hired at the tourist office. Those
executives surprised the agencies involved by launching
another review. In a memo to employees yesterday, Bozell
President David Bell said the news was particularly
disappointing because the agency had late last year been
awarded the account in "very tough and open competition."</p>
<p>HEARTGUIDE: The American Heart Association, as expected,
dropped its seal-of-approval program for low-fat foods
yesterday following objections from the Food and Drug
Administration. The AHA said it plans to refocus its
HeartGuide program on nutrition education efforts.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION: Kallir, Philips, Ross, a health-care ad
agency, acquired Rainoldi, Kerzner & Radcliffe, San
Francisco. Terms weren't disclosed. Kallir Philips, New York,
is part of Omnicom Group.</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: Steven Dammers and Robert Ravitz were named
executive vice presidents at Grey Advertising, New York.</p>
