	<p class="article-leader">In your March 8 page-one article "Fertility Rights," I
sympathize with Eloisa Silva. Here she is, a single mother of
three, trying to work, maintain and survive. Barely above the
poverty level, she stretches every cent of her earnings in
order for her children to eat a fairly well-balanced meal and
wear decent clothes. Birth control is a prime choice for her.
   Why shouldn't there be facilities for low-income families
to receive qualitative and affordable health care? And yes,
any type of birth control or family planning available?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The theory that family-planning centers promote
promiscuity is ludicrous.</p>

<p>Ms. Silva is portrayed as being a "pawn" in the "war over
abortion rights" because her birth-control pills are no
longer provided free by a state-subsidized planning center.
She now has to buy the pills, and if the situation continues,
"I won't be able to make soup for my kids."</p>
<p>This attitude has me livid. What is more important, her
hormones or her children? What about her sexual partner(s)
and his responsibility in the situation? Our society is so
hung up on "rights" that we all too often neglect
"responsibilities."</p>
<p>I believe in helping others, but I do not believe in
carrying them, swaddling them in cotton to insulate them from
reality and responsibility. This merely cripples them,
causing any latent sense of responsibility to atrophy rather
than develop and become stronger. I feel sorry for Ms.
Silva's children, but I have no patience with their mother.</p>

<p>It's Oh] so easy and Oh] so cowardly to force others to
follow your beliefs when you don't have to pay the price.
Make the anti-abortionist anti-family-planning-center people
pay in hard cash for the costs of raising these unwanted
children, including the costs of any crime-related activities
they get into because they were unloved and grew up in
deprived circumstances. Make them donate time to raising
these unwanted children they are trying to force other women
to have. Do their religious convictions go that deep? If it's
wrong to abort a fetus, it's even more wrong to make an
innocent child grow up unwanted and in squalid poverty.</p>

<p>Whenever I hear the words "rights" and "refunding" in the
same sentence, I check to see if my wallet is still in my
pocket. Why do Ms. Silva and her boyfriend have a right to
taxpayer-underwritten fun time? In the real free market, the
users bear the costs of a good or service.</p>
<p>You throw in a couple of smoke screens: These people are
poor; the government-funded clinics do other things, too. And
one threat: If you don't cough up for the condoms, we'll make
you pay for the welfare babies.</p>

<p>Hallelujah for California and Gov. George Deukmejian for
cutting the family-planning budget greatly. None of us can
demand financial or supportive help in anything if we refuse
to obey certain standards, laws, ethics or at the very least
self-control.</p>
<p>I for one do not want to encourage or give to the Silvas
of this country as they seek to drain funds and show a poor
example to the next generation by demanding we pay for their
play.</p>

<p>Thanks for describing how anti-abortion organizations
forced the closing of family-planning clinics in California
and are close to doing so in several other states. For many
years, pro-choice and family-planning advocates have tried to
make the public aware that a significant faction of the
anti-choice community seeks to eliminate not only the right
to choose abortion but the right to use contraception as
well. The response has been that pro-choice groups were
engaging in hyperbole to further their own cause, or that
they were foolish to believe that opponents of contraception
could be influential in modern America. Now perhaps those who
have dismissed the anti-contraception forces as unimportant
fringe extremists will wake up to the damage these people can
do.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be wonderful if each anti-abortionist adopted
an unwanted child -- not the perfect, healthy little ones,
but the drug and AIDS victims, the abused and neglected and
unloved? There seem to be plenty of them these days.</p>
<p>Then those folks could give these threatened children the
advantages of a loving family life they might never have
otherwise.</p>
