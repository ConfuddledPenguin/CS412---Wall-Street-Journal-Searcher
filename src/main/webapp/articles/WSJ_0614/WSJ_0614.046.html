	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission voted
to seek public comment on ways to update the 50-year-old
statute that governs mutual funds.
   The comments are being solicited in connection with a
study started recently by the SEC's investment-management
division to suggest legislative and regulatory changes to the
Investment Company Act, which governs regulations of mutual
funds, said Kathryn McGrath, the division's head. The study
is scheduled to last at least until next spring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC will request comments on such issues as
distribution of mutual fund shares, closed-end funds and
repurchases of shares, transactions in options and futures
contracts, and the regulation of securities products sold by
insurance companies.</p>
<p>SEC members strongly support the plan to update the
statute regulating mutual funds. "I'm afraid the Investment
Company Act has become cumbersome and outdated and even
anti-competitive," Commissioner Philip Lochner said.</p>
<p>The agency also voted to seek comment on a proposal that
would allow issuers of initial public offerings to distribute
an abbreviated version of the offering's prospectus to
investors. A summary prospectus provides investors with a
condensed version of key information in the full registration
statement, enabling investors to determine whether they are
interested in more information about the offering, the SEC
said.</p>
<p>While summary prospectuses have been permitted for issuers
who met certain criteria, the proposal would for the first
time allow their use in IPOs. Issuers usually don't take
advantage of the procedure unless their prospectus exceeds
100 pages, said Linda Quinn, head of the SEC's division of
corporation finance.</p>
<p>The proposal to extend the procedure to IPOs stems from a
recent inquiry by an issuer of an IPO, SEC officials said.
Because of the length of the prospectus, the cost of
soliciting investor interest in the offering would be
substantial.</p>
<p>Ms. Quinn acknowledged that the use of abbreviated
prospectuses to generate investor interest "has the potential
for abuse." But since IPOs are always reviewed by the
commission staff before they are offered to the public, "I
don't think that will figure in," she said.</p>
<p>The SEC also voted to seek comment on a proposal aimed at
assuring that regulators have access to records of investment
companies that invest in foreign securities. However, several
commissioners, including Chairman Richard Breeden, indicated
that they may not support the proposal when it comes up for a
final vote. "I don't want to suggest support for comment on
this issue indicates support for adoption of the rule," he
said.</p>
<p>The proposal would direct investment companies to keep
certain books and records in the U.S. and require companies
to preserve all original books and records in English. The
rule would ensure that the SEC staff can carry out its
responsibility to inspect investment companies, Ms. McGrath
said.</p>
