	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Toronto's Reichmann family said it will boost
its offer to buy out minority shareholders of GW Utilities
Ltd. to 40 Canadian dollars (US$34.13).
   A spokesman for the Reichmann's closely held holding
company, Olympia & York Developments Ltd., said the offer was
increased by C$4 a share "to reflect the potential increase
in the value of the shares as a result of transactions
announced since the going-private proposal was made."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In January, Olympia & York proposed to offer shareholders
C$36 a share, subject to shareholder approval at a special
meeting. The company already holds an 89.3% stake in GW
Utilities.</p>
<p>Since then, GW Utilities has announced plans to tender its
82% stake in Consumers' Gas Co. to a C$1.1 billion bid by
British Gas PLC. In April, Olympia & York announced a
reshuffling of its other energy assets, which would see GW
Utilities's subsidiary, Home Oil Co., merge with Gulf Canada
Resources Ltd., 74.3% owned by Olympia & York.</p>
<p>If either of those transactions don't receive necessary
shareholder and regulatory approvals, the Reichmann spokesman
said Olympia & York "would come back with another
privatization offer {for GW Utilities} similar to the first
one."</p>
<p>In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, GW
Utilities closed at C$35, up 88 Canadian cents.</p>
