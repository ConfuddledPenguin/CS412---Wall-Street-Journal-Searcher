	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd. said it will make and sell
microprocessors based on an advanced design by
Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif.
   The deal gives Hitachi, a major supplier of
semiconductors, a leg up in the competition to supply a new
class of microprocessors called reduced instruction set
computing, or Risc, chips. These microprocessors, which form
the heart of computers or control devices, are generally more
powerful than traditional microprocessors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hewlett-Packard said last year it would try to market its
Risc chips, which are used only in the company's own
computers. Last July, Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi agreed to
develop jointly a high-speed Risc chip.</p>
<p>"This is a big boost for H-P," Andrew Allison, an
independent computer analyst, said of Hitachi's announcement.
"It puts the world on notice that H-P is serious" about
broadening the use of its Risc chips. By doing so,
Hewlett-Packard can encourage more easily software outsiders
to develop software for its Risc chip, which in turn will
benefit sales of its computers.</p>
<p>The arrangement should help Hitachi compete better against
Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc., U.S. firms that also are
seeking to supply Risc chips, Mr. Allison said.</p>
