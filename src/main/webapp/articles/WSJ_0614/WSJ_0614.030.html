	<p class="article-leader">Chicago -- Anyone who loves the theater is likely to be
enthusiastic about Timberlake Wertenbaker's "Our Country's
Good." Among other things, the play, being presented here by
the Remains Theater, is a ringing testament to the civilizing
effects of theater.
   Set in Australia in 1788 and 1789, "Our Country's Good" is
based on Thomas Keneally's novel "The Playmaker," which in
turn was based on actual events. In January 1788, after an
eight-month trip from England, a group of convicts in the
charge of British officers arrived in Australia. In Ms.
Wertenbaker's play the governor of this prison outpost, Capt.
Arthur Phillip (Paul Jones), decides that it would be a good
morale booster for the convicts to put on a play. The person
chosen to direct the production is Second Lt. Ralph Clark (Si
Osborne), a person devoted to the theater and sympathetic to
the prisoners. The play selected is George Farquhar's "The
Recruiting Officer," a great favorite in 18th-century
England.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Opposed to the scheme is Maj. Robbie Ross (Kevin Hurley),
the villain of the piece, who believes that prisoners, rather
than being coddled, should be lashed until their skin is raw,
even for unproven minor offenses. Lt. Clark sets about
casting and rehearsing his play and Maj. Ross attempts to set
up roadblocks every step of the way; the notion of the arts
as having spiritual or therapeutic value is anathema to Ross.</p>
<p>Nor does Lt. Clark's cast of misfits make it easy for him
either: Several performers refuse to play unappealing
characters or take part in scenes that they feel show them in
a bad light. Arguments between director and actors become the
occasion for Ms. Wertenbaker to examine the conflict between
art and life and to show what a powerful symbolic force
theater can be.</p>
<p>The love interest is provided by Lt. Clark and Mary
Brenham (Holly Fulger), the leading lady in his production.
Separated by many months and thousands of miles from his
wife, Clark is overwhelmed both by loneliness and the simple,
appealing charm of Mary. At one point, Maj. Ross condemns to
death one of Clark's actresses, and it looks as if the
production will not go on. It finally does, however, with
great success: The faith that Clark and his commanding
officer have shown in the undertaking is vindicated.</p>
<p>Obviously a skillful dramatist, Ms. Wertenbaker has
written a deft, provocative, entertaining play that has been
given a first-rate production by the Remains company under
the direction of Amy Morton.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Our Country's Good" offers a prime example, which could
be multiplied many times over, of the seriously flawed
process by which the Pulitzer Prize in drama is selected each
year. In a recent article I pointed out the inequities and
inconsistencies in this process, the most egregious problem
being the eligibility of plays produced in regional theaters
across the country. In a letter of reply printed in this
paper May 8, Robert Christopher, administrator of the
Pulitzer Prize, ignored this aspect of the problem
altogether.</p>
<p>The premise of the present procedure is that regional
theaters are first-class professional theaters, and that
their productions should be regarded as the equivalent of
anything on Broadway. As a result, it was decided in the
early 1980s that plays eligible for consideration by the
Pulitzer Board no longer should be confined to those produced
in New York City. This decision was made, however, without
giving any thought to the myriad problems that its
implementation would present.</p>
<p>The first problem is deciding exactly how the many new
plays that open across the country will be given due
consideration. There are some 170 full-scale professional
theaters in the U.S. operating under Actors Equity
Association contracts. These theaters produce an average of
at least one new play per season -- realistically it is
probably more than that. Let us say conservatively that 200
new plays a year are produced in theaters that stretch from
Portland, Maine, to San Diego, Calif., from Sarasota, Fla.,
to Seattle, Wash. How can any three-person jury even begin to
cover this range of plays?</p>
<p>Of the three jurors this past year, two live in New York
and one in Boston. How likely are critics in these cities to
see plays in Minneapolis, Milwaukee or Houston? When jurors
are from the West Coast, what are the chances of their seeing
plays in Hartford or Washington, D.C.? "Our Country's Good"
was presented at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles last
fall. How many of this year's jurors saw that production, and
how many of next year's jurors will see the current Remains
production before it closes Sunday?</p>
<p>There are ways to address this problem, but so far the
Pulitzer officials have stubbornly refused even to
acknowledge that a problem exists. One possibility is to have
a group of critics in various parts of the country nominate
plays for the three jurors to consider. This is the method
adopted by the American Theater Critics Association in
arriving at its choice of an outstanding play to be included
in the annual "Best Plays" volume edited by Otis Guernsey.</p>
<p>The chaos surrounding the assessing of regional theater
productions is compounded by the question of the year in
which a play is eligible for consideration. In 1987 the
Pulitzer Prize for drama was awarded to August Wilson's
"Fences"; this year it went to Mr. Wilson's "The Piano
Lesson." There is no question that these two plays are worthy
recipients of the award. When "Fences" won, however, it had
been produced the previous year in fully mounted,
professional productions and had been given the
aforementioned American Theater Critics award in 1986. Why
was it not awarded the Pulitzer Prize that same year when, in
fact, no Pulitzer award for best play was given; and why was
it considered eligible the next year?</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson's "The Piano Lesson" which won this year,
originally was produced 2 1/2 years ago and given six
separate productions before arriving on Broadway. Mr.
Christopher in his letter to the Journal stated that the
chairman of this year's jury felt the play is "significantly
different" from its previous incarnations. There is little
basis for such an argument: The play now on Broadway has
undergone fine-tuning and has a revised ending, but
essentially it is the identical play presented in 1987: the
same theme, the same characters, the same sequence of events.
Furthermore, in which of its six previous productions did
this crucial transformation take place?</p>
<p>Besides, a difference of opinion about whether or not it
is a new play is not the point anyway. A determination of
this sort should not be the whim of one critic or another;
there should be objective criteria to determine such matters,
and those criteria should be clearly stated.</p>
<p>In the same manner, there should be no ambiguity about the
year in which a play is eligible for consideration. The
alternatives are clear and the logic unassailable: If
regional theater productions are tryouts, then plays produced
there should not be eligible for consideration; if they are
major productions, equivalent to Broadway, then plays
produced there should be eligible when they first appear and
not two or three years later.</p>
