	<p class="article-leader">FAIRLAWN, Ohio -- GenCorp Inc. said the final appeal
concerning its 1988 sale of station KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to
Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney Co. has been dismissed.
   The transfer of the station, currently KCAL-TV, is now
complete, GenCorp said. GenCorp, which has aerospace,
automotive and plastics businesses, has been disposing of its
radio and television stations after a lengthy controversy
over the company's fitness to own broadcasting licenses.</p>
