	<p class="article-leader">Piero Bonissone never fancied himself a salesman. Quite
the opposite: He's intense, bookish and a top scientist at
General Electric Co. A few years ago, he developed an
artificial intelligence program to pinpoint problems in
locomotives. But now Mr. Bonissone has come up with a
surprising new version of his program with a quite different
purpose: identifying corporate takeover targets. And he's
just sure it can earn bundles of money for GE.
   So now the 39-year-old scientist finds himself in the
unlikely position of stalking Gabriel Samothrakis, who also
works for GE -- as a technology expert in its Kidder Peabody
& Co. investment banking unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bonissone plots his strategy carefully. He figures a
hard sell won't work. So he invites Mr. Samothrakis to a
meeting of academics and bankers at which he reveals just a
hint of his invention. And then, with Mr. Samothrakis's
appetite whetted, Mr. Bonissone plans to set up a one-on-one
meeting, moving in for the kill.</p>
<p>What's going on here? It's a part of the life of a
researcher at GE, where Mr. Bonissone sits in a chaotic
office surrounded by books on computational logic and
esoteric journals, but says: "I also have to be
entrepreneurial."</p>
<p>GE is turning around the equation of U.S. business.
Instead of pushing marketers to come up with ideas and then
asking scientists to make them work, the company increasingly
gives researchers wide berth to imagine and invent -- and
then shop the invention around GE's divisions.</p>
<p>The result: GE and its scientist-salesmen regularly manage
to transfer technology from the laboratory to the market, a
transition that frequently baffles American business.</p>
<p>U.S. companies lead the world in inventing and innovating,
but often drop the ball after that. "I give American
companies C-minus when it comes to nurturing and managing
technology," says William Sommers, a technology expert at the
consulting firm Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. "Those that do
relatively well are too few."</p>
<p>A big reason may be that the companies' research and
development culture itself stifles commercialization. "The
right environment alone can raise productivity 75% to 100%,"
says Walter Robb, the head of GE's R&D, who has gone to
unusual lengths to promote technology transfer.</p>
<p>GE's record is hardly flawless. The company developed a
new compressor for its refrigerators, failed to consider
adequately its potential for failure, and ended up losing
$450 million when it turned out to be unreliable. Even so, of
250 technology projects GE undertook between 1982 and 1986,
an internal study done by Booz Allen found that 150 produced
major applications. The average for U.S. industry is one in
10. Most companies fail to "identify and spread their core
technologies," says Booz Allen's Mr. Sommers.</p>
<p>At GE, because researchers are supposed to sell their
ideas around the whole company, they sometimes find
applications far afield from the original intentions.
Something invented to protect coal-spraying nozzles in an
experimental locomotive ended up creating a new generation of
energy-saving light bulbs. A medical diagnostic technology
used for imaging the human body became a cost-saving device
for inspecting jet engines. Sophisticated coating and
machining techniques developed for aircraft engines got
transferred to GE's power generation business.</p>
<p>Competitors and analysts say the cross-pollination of
technology and the ability to find a profitable use for it
are major factors in GE's three straight years of
double-digit earnings growth and its optimistic long-term
outlook. It's also helping the $55 billion company shed its
image as a hodgepodge conglomerate in lighting, medical
equipment, plastics, power generation and aircraft engines.
"The synergies aren't obvious, but they help GE dominate in
its markets," says David Gardner, an analyst who follows GE
at Nomura Research.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this attracts a host of rival executives
to GE's Schenectady, N.Y., research center to learn how GE
cycles new technology through the company. "We have the
finest technologies we need, but getting them into production
is where we need to make improvement," says Donald Runkle,
vice president of General Motors Corp.'s advanced engineering
staff and a recent Schenectady pilgrim. Mr. Runkle says he is
studying "rules and incentives that set the environment for
transferring technology" from the laboratory to the market.
"We think GE has something to offer us."</p>
<p>That example starts with the nurturing climate at its
Schenectady R&D hub, a sprawling complex on 600 acres with
1,800 researchers, including 500 Ph.D.s.</p>
<p>Mr. Robb, research and development chief since 1986, is
the first R&D director at GE with experience in manufacturing
(plastics and medical operations). Manufacturing types are
usually bottom-line oriented. But Mr. Robb has increased
funding for risky, long-term basic research by more than 50%,
although he will not reveal specific figures. GE's total R&D
budget is $1.33 billion.</p>
<p>At the same time, he is working to foster close, informal
contacts between researchers of different disciplines. He
insists, for example, that they vary their table-mates in the
cafeteria.</p>
<p>Researchers are regularly treated to art exhibits (most
recent: Leonardo da Vinci) and classical-music concerts in
the atrium of the corporate research and development center,
also known as CR&D.</p>
<p>Mr. Robb says he wants to emphasize creativity, whether
that means art or a new kind of plastic. Mr. Robb, a singer,
formed the CR&D Choral Group, and the notice of the first
performance hangs on bulletin boards next to announcements of
such meetings as one on "the design and operation of a
municipal mass-burn incinerator."</p>
<p>Mr. Robb also has started a regular Friday evening "free
beer and pretzel party." The gathering starts with his
announcement of the price of GE stock and sometimes includes
his card tricks or a pat on the back for a scientist. But
mostly it's an occasion to trade ideas and schmooze.</p>
<p>This informality has produced concrete results. GE
theoretician Richard Messmer gave a talk one day in 1988
about how a plastic molecule could be rearranged so it would
conduct electricity. Clifford Spiro, a chemist who had
attended the talk, then dropped into the beer and pretzel
social hour. William Banholzer, an engineer, was there, too.
The chemist and the engineer got to talking about Mr.
Messmer's theory. And then they got to work.</p>
<p>Late this month, they will file for a patent covering
their technique. Mr. Spiro says it will have electronic
applications, including plastic batteries. Says Mr. Spiro:
"At informal gatherings you talk to people you wouldn't
normally on a problem."</p>
<p>Four years ago, metallurgist Harvey Cline was developing a
method of measuring the surface topography of silicon chips,
which would show the wafers' defects. The technique
essentially involved measuring three dimensions of hair-thin
surfaces. Then one day, GE's medical division sent a man from
Milwaukee to talk at the R&D center about the need for
three-dimensional imaging for medical purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. Cline thought he could use his research in chips to
solve the medical problem. He teamed up with a computer
graphic designer, William Lorensen. Mr. Cline says that for
weeks he worked with Mr. Lorensen without seeking approval
from his manager. "Interdisciplinary work is encouraged
here," he says. "Then, when my manager in electronics saw
what I was doing, he was encouraging."</p>
<p>Mr. Cline says he then switched departments and worked
directly for the Milwaukee-based medical division, without
having to leave Schenectady.</p>
<p>"I didn't know any medical physics," says Mr. Cline. It
took him three years to learn about human bone, tissue and
muscle, often using a medical CT (computed tomography)
scanner on Mr. Lorensen. He was able to apply a novel
mathematical technique drawn from his silicon days. And he
finally succeeded.</p>
<p>Although the technology is still being developed,
three-dimensional imaging will help pinpoint targets in brain
surgery and other complex operations. These machines are
aimed at the estimated $100 million-a-year market for 3-D
imaging, where currently two-dimensional data are
extrapolated into three-dimensional images, says Philip Drew,
a medical-equipment consultant in Concord, Mass.</p>
<p>GE's culture allows a researcher who hits a brick wall in
one department to move to another. Dominic Cusano, a
physicist at the R&D center, had long believed that GE's CT
machine was inefficient, converting only a third of the
X-rays it scanned to images. The problem was the xenon gas
used to detect the X-rays. But in 1980 the medical division
gave up looking for a substitute.</p>
<p>Mr. Cusano, however, did not. He walked across the hall at
the R&D center to a ceramic lab, where Charles Greskovich was
using ceramics to make a "lamp envelope," the small chamber
inside a light bulb that holds filaments. "I said, Charlie, I
am stuck," recalls Mr. Cusano.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Greskovich knew little about CT machines, he
did know how to build complex crystal structures. The pair
collaborated informally for three years, often on Friday
afternoons. Management supported their efforts because both
had excellent track records.</p>
<p>Sure enough, they eventually developed a crystalline
solid-state detector to capture X-rays for imaging. GE says
this device produces images five times better than those
produced by xenon gas. The new scanners have brought in more
than $100 million in sales.</p>
<p>And the researchers were able to show other divisions of
the company how they could benefit from the development. The
scanners now not only serve the medical division, but are
also used to inspect the inside of GE's jet engines and steer
laser drills in the manufacture of turbine blades, saving
more than $2 million a year in labor and material costs
alone.</p>
<p>N.V. Philips' director of CT marketing and sales support,
Walter Cullen, concedes that GE's solid-state detector gives
GE machines "an advantage" by producing better images. "But
solid state is more expensive to maintain and run," he says.</p>
<p>It wasn't always like this at GE. Lowell Steele, a former
GE R&D planner, recalls his frustrations in the late 1970s
trying to apply the company's knowledge chips, circuitry and
other electronics to process the transactions of GE Capital,
a financial arm. "I got some scars from pushing that
technology," says Mr. Steele.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the late 1970s, GE's medical division was so
content with its CT machines that it turned a deaf ear to its
engineers' proposal to develop a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) diagnostic machine, which uses a powerful magnetic
field to develop images of the inside of the human body. "I
was told it was too researchy," recalls Rowland Redington,
the father of GE's MRI research.</p>
<p>Only after competitors' machines hit the market did GE
turn to Mr. Redington's team at the R&D center. That lateness
might have doomed GE's effort.</p>
<p>However, once GE got started, it managed to produce an MRI
just a year after Philips, Siemens and a dozen small U.S.
companies had. GE recovered quickly by pulling together
technology from different businesses. For the powerful
magnets used in MRI, it drew upon the design expertise at its
power generation business, and circuitry from military
electronics. Now GE dominates the American MRI market with an
estimated 46% share.</p>
<p>To ensure such cross-pollination, about 35 of the R&D
center's 1,800 researchers transfer annually to various GE
manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>William Hackett, an electrical engineer, has moved from
appliances to power generation to the electrical distribution
and control business (ED&C), and then to electronics,
aerospace and lighting -- cross-pollinating technology all
the while.</p>
<p>At ED&C, for example, he applied a painting technique from
the appliance business to electrical switch gears, saving
$300,000 a year in labor and material because of the improved
process. "The process also increased durability of the switch
gear and it became a marketing feature for us," Mr. Hackett
says. "What appears unique in one area is transferable."</p>
<p>General Motors is one company taking its cue from GE to
change its R&D approach. GM recently decreed that its
researchers spend 15% of their time pondering what technology
they could transfer and where. Mr. Runkle, the head of
advanced engineering, says GM also has begun transferring
researchers who develop a technology to the site of
application.</p>
<p>That jump is hard to take, as Mr. Bonissone, the GE
artificial-intelligence expert, can attest. His program,
which at first identified problems with locomotives, was
modified to find problems in jet engines and plastics. Then
it was modified for use by the Pentagon on ships, submarines
and fighter planes to prepare them for instantaneous counter
measures in enemy attacks. So it makes perfect sense to him
that Kidder Peabody should use the program. "As in war," he
says, "you have raiders and targets in mergers and
acquisition."</p>
<p>But Mr. Samothrakis is not convinced. The technology "must
prove that it can make money for us," he says.</p>
<p>Their meeting will probably be later this summer. Says Mr.
Bonissone: "It's clearly going to be a selling job."</p>
