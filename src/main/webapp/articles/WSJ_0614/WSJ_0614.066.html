	<p class="article-leader">Prime Motor Inns Inc., seeking more cash to pay debt, said
it agreed to sell all of its Howard Johnson and Ramada
franchise systems rather than retain a 35% stake in them as
previously planned.
   Under the new accord, Prime will receive $170 million for
the two franchise systems from Blackstone Capital Partners
L.P., an investment partnership that is an affiliate of
Blackstone Group, a New York-based investment banking firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But although the new agreement calls for Prime to receive
about $40 million more, it will give up the 35% interest it
would have kept under the old agreement with Blackstone. With
about $60 million face amount in notes Prime would have
received, the initial transaction totaled about $200 million.</p>
<p>However, a spokeswoman for Prime, based in Fairfield,
N.J., said the company values the 35% equity interest in the
franchise systems and the original note at considerably less
than $60 million.</p>
<p>Peter E. Simon, Prime chairman, said the increased cash
payment will enable Prime to "significantly reduce" debt and
to invest some proceeds in its AmeriSuites and Wellesley Inns
limited service hotels, which it plans to expand.</p>
<p>Prime is one of the largest U.S. hotel companies.
Including its Rodeway Inns International franchise system,
Prime has a total of about 1,100 properties with about
150,000 rooms. Those include 475 U.S. Ramada properties with
75,000 rooms and 450 Howard Johnson properties with about
55,000 rooms. The company also has more than $200 million of
construction projects under way.</p>
<p>Prime, which expanded in a period of softness in the real
estate market and tight financing, has about $280 million in
bank debt. It is still owed about $200 million by FCD
Hospitality Inc., which last year borrowed from Prime to
purchase Servico, a hotel operator, from Southmark Corp.</p>
<p>Officials of Prime have said that tomorrow is the cut-off
date for FCD to start paying back its loan before Prime would
start attaching assets. But Prime is still "evaluating"
alternatives, Joseph P. Gaynor III, senior vice president of
corporate finance, said. He said Prime is considering selling
Rodeway as well.</p>
<p>Another reason Prime may have chosen to sell the
franchises outright was the interest a competing company,
Manor Care Inc., had expressed in them, said Henry R.
Silverman, Blackstone's general partner who will be chairman
and chief executive officer of the new company. Officials of
Manor Care, the Silver Spring, Md., franchiser of Quality
Inns, couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Silverman is a
former chairman and chief executive of Days Inns of America
Inc.</p>
