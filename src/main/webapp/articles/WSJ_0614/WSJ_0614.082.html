	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks ignored late-day declines in big
exchange-listed issues and closed higher, like the bond
market.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.30 to 468.86, a 0.5%
gain. Volume remained brisk at 163.5 million shares, up
slightly from 163.3 million Tuesday. Advancing shares again
outpaced decliners, 1,021 to 910.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think secondary stocks are finding their own way," said
William Sulya, director of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Son,
St. Louis. "Business {in OTC trading} in general is much
better than it was in the first quarter."</p>
<p>Yesterday's brisk trading of smaller stocks surprised
Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. Mr.
Zipper said he expected caution from investors in advance of
several economic indicators due out today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Institutional buying of OTC stocks was strong
across-the-board, he said, suggesting that portfolio managers
are favoring smaller stocks as they approach the end of the
quarter.</p>
<p>Utility shares surged, pushing the Nasdaq Utility Index up
6.17 to 674.84. Cable television shares, which are included
in the index, got a boost from County NatWest analyst Lisa
Donneson, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. The analyst upgraded her investment opinion on the
group to a "buy" from a "hold," citing an easier regulatory
climate and prospects for changes in evaluating cable
industry loans. Tele-Communications, one of the day's
most-active stocks, rose 1/2 to 15 5/8, and American
Television & Communications gained 1 1/4 to 39 1/4.</p>
<p>Technology shares also were strong, pushing the Nasdaq 100
Index of larger issues, including many computer stocks, up
3.89 to 484.11 and lifting the larger Nasdaq Industrial Index
3.59 to 499.09.</p>
<p>Microsoft rose from early weakness to a gain of 5/8 to 76
1/2. The company extended its stock buy-back program through
June 30, 1991, and Intel gained 1/8 to 48.</p>
<p>Westmark International fell 1 to 38 1/4 on nearly 1.6
million shares. Robert T. DeGavre, chief financial officer of
the Seattle maker of ultrasound and other medical equipment,
told DJPIR that investors have been nervous since a Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst lowered his rating on the stock last
week. Mr. DeGavre, who called the stock's weakness an
"over-reaction," said he hopes to provide investors next week
with specific guidance about second-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Hambrecht & Quist analyst Neal Bradsher
repeated cautious comments on Westmark's near-term outlook.
However, Mr. Bradsher said in the long term he thinks the
company is well-positioned in its markets, according to
DJPIR. Westmark was scheduled to appear last night at a Ragen
& Mackenzie investment conference in Seattle.</p>
<p>International Microelectronic Products was the most
active, adding 5/16 to 2 7/16 on volume of 3.7 million
shares. Most of that volume came from the sale of a block
representing 7.5% of the company's shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Market sources say British Petroleum sold the 1.8
million-share block, which it had inherited through its
acquisition of Standard Oil (Ohio). Sohio had acquired the
stake through an original venture capital investment in
International Microelectronic, a San Jose, Calif., maker of
integrated circuits.</p>
<p>The sources say the sale was part of BP's divestment of
investments in the electronics industry. An International
Microelectronic spokesman said there have been no corporate
developments that may have prompted the sale.</p>
<p>U.S. HealthCare jumped 1 3/4 to 19 3/8. Leonard Abramson,
president of the Blue Bell, Pa., operator of health
maintenance organizations, said in an interview the company
expects to report earnings for the second quarter ending in
June of more than 25 cents a share, compared with 14 cents a
share in the year-earlier quarter. Mr. Abramson also forecast
that the company will have record operating earnings and
revenue in 1990, as analysts expect.</p>
<p>Gendex climbed 3/4 to 14. John McDonough, president and
chief executive officer of the Milwaukee maker of dental and
medical X-ray equipment, told a meeting of the New York
Society of Securities Analysts that he's "comfortable" with
analysts' estimates that Gendex will earn 90 to 91 cents a
share for fiscal 1991 ending in March, compared with 81 cents
a share in 1990.</p>
<p>Cell Technology added 3/8 to 2 5/8 after the Boulder,
Colo., drug company said it will receive its first U.S.
patent covering the company's anti-cancer drug for adult
brain cancer.</p>
<p>Amgen advanced 1 1/2 to 74. Shortly after the market
closed, the Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology concern said
its board approved a two-for-one stock split and the July 25
redemption of the company's 8% convertible subordinated
debentures.</p>
<p>National Savings Bank of Albany tumbled 3 3/8 to 28 5/8
after the Albany, N.Y., bank rejected a buy-out proposal from
TrustCo Bank Corp. of Schenectady, N.Y. National Savings also
doubled its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 15
cents. TrustCo shares fell 3/4 to 30 1/4.</p>
<p>Elcotel dropped 5/8 to 2 1/8 after the Sarasota, Fla.,
marketer of privately owned pay telephones reported a loss
for the fourth quarter ended March 31 of six cents a share,
compared with year-earlier net income from continuing
operations of five cents a share. The company also restated
sales revenue for the fiscal second and third quarters of
1989, which resulted in operating losses for those quarters,
rather than profits as originally reported.</p>
<p>Analysts' comments fueled activity in several stocks,
according to DJPIR.</p>
<p>Nike gained 1 7/8 to 80 1/2 after Merrill Lynch analyst
Brenda Gall raised her intermediate-term rating on the
Beaverton, Ore., athletic footwear maker to "buy" from "above
average." Merrill Lynch also selected Nike as its weekly
"focus 1" stock pick.</p>
<p>American Management Systems jumped 1 1/2 to 16 3/8 after
Alex. Brown & Sons analyst Cato D. Carpenter raised his
investment rating on the stock to "buy" from "hold" and
increased his 1990 and 1991 earnings estimates for the
Arlington, Va., information systems services company. DJPIR
reported that Mr. Carpenter now estimates American Management
will earn $1 a share in 1990 and $1.20 a share in 1991,
compared with 56 cents a share in 1989, and is optimistic
about the company's earnings momentum and introduction of new
products.</p>
<p>Rouse fell 1 to 23. Merrill Lynch analyst Jordan Heller
cut his near- and intermediate-term ratings on the Columbia,
Md., real estate concern to "hold" from "above average,"
DJPIR said. Mr. Heller, who cautioned that negative market
sentiment about problem real estate markets will prevent the
stock from outperforming the market, maintains his long-term
"buy" opinion on the stock and didn't change his earnings
estimates for the company.</p>
