	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Democratic Party is suffering a severe
case of unfulfilled expectations over the savings-and-loan
debacle.
   Many Democrats believe they should be bashing President
Bush and the Republicans for causing and mishandling the
nation's biggest financial scandal. "It's the biggest issue I
can see for us against Bush," says Rep. Dan Glickman (D.,
Kan.).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The issue resonates with the voters. "I have not done a
town meeting where this hasn't been a major focus of
attention," says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). "I am
astonished by the level of interest, but more horrified by
the level of anger. This is a political issue of the very
first magnitude and it's going to bite somebody hard."</p>
<p>But, so far, the Democrats have remained mostly passive in
what seems to be a ready-made issue for them. When Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady went before the Senate Banking
Committee recently to concede that his agency had grossly
underestimated the cost of the thrift-rescue plan, Bush
administration aides were astounded -- and relieved -- to
find questioning by the panel's Democrats so tame.</p>
<p>The reason? In the public mind, the Democrats are at least
as culpable in the S&L mess as the Republicans. Four of the
"Keating Five" senators under investigation for intervening
on behalf of S&L kingpin Charles Keating are Democrats,
including the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,
Donald Riegel of Michigan. And former House Speaker James
Wright and former House Banking Committee Chairman Ferdinand
St Germain both were ruined politically after allegations of
close ties with thrift executives.</p>
<p>"I don't believe that either party is totally without sin
on the issue," says Rep. Thomas Carper (D., Del.).</p>
<p>As a result, Republicans doubt the $100 billion-plus
crisis will rub off on them exclusively. "A thumbnail sketch
of the history of the S&L crisis has a veritable rogues'
gallery of Democratic leaders in it," says John Buckley, a
Republican strategist.</p>
<p>Instead, incumbents of either stripe may well be victims
of the S&L fallout. "It is best as an outsider-vs.-insider
issue, as opposed to a Democrat-vs.-Republican issue," says
Harrison Hickman, a Democratic consultant.</p>
<p>"It's bad for everybody," agrees Sen. John Breaux (D.,
La.), chairman of the Senate Democrats' campaign committee.
"It's bad for incumbents."</p>
<p>"It's going to be a very salient issue in the fall,"
predicts Roger Stone, a Republican consultant. "Incumbents
beware]"</p>
<p>In particular, the S&L bailout is expected to play a role
in the re-election contests this year of Democratic Rep.
Frank Annunzio of Illinois, a senior member of the House
Banking Committee, and of GOP Rep. Charles Pashayan of
California, who accepted and then later returned a campaign
contribution from a group run by Mr. Keating.</p>
<p>Still, a growing number of Democrats believe their party
should try to use the thrift crisis against the Republicans.
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska
and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York make criticism of the S&L
bailout part of their stump speeches. Last week at New York
State's Democratic Party convention in Albany, Gov. Cuomo
excoriated the Republicans for allowing thrift executives to
"do what they want to do." The result, he said, was that
"they stole everything in sight. They fouled up everything in
sight and now you're paying for it."</p>
<p>Other Democrats are taking this same line of attack. The
S&L situation "is going to be one of the most important
issues of the campaign," says Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.).
"If there's a political price to be paid, and there will be,"
he adds, "I don't think those bills are going to come due for
Democrats."</p>
<p>There is some reason for Democrats to be sanguine that
they can direct voter anger at the GOP. Many of them say that
the thrift industry's basic problems stem from the Reagan
administration's emphasis on deregulation and its
unwillingness to budget an adequate number of government
auditors. In addition, they note that Mr. Bush was at the
center of the issue; as vice president he headed Mr. Reagan's
task force on deregulation.</p>
<p>What's more, the most recent setbacks in the bailout --
especially its ever-escalating cost -- are easily laid at the
feet of the Bush administration, Democrats say.
"Responsibility for what happened in the past is somewhat
shared," says Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.). "But since {last
year's bailout} bill passed they have done a very poor job of
administering it. . . . It's been a real screw-up."</p>
<p>Few believe the S&L problem is much better now than when
the president won the legislation he sought last year to
clean up the mess. And Democrats have begun to target their
barbs at what they see as shortcomings of that enterprise.
These include the Justice Department's slowness in
prosecuting thrift executives and the Treasury's long-delayed
sale of confiscated assets.</p>
<p>Some congressional Democrats warn that the Bush
administration's request for more bailout money will be
rejected unless the deposit-insurance system is overhauled in
a populist way, including placing lower limits on the amount
of deposits that are federally insured. This would serve to
put a Democratic stamp on the solution. What's more,
Democratic-led efforts are under way in both the Senate and
the House to force the administration to spend more than it
wants to prosecute savings-and-loan criminals.</p>
<p>"This is worse than Watergate," asserts Rep. Annunzio of
the House Banking Committee. His subcommittee on financial
institutions, which already has grilled the president's son
Neil about his directorship of a failed Colorado thrift, has
scheduled other hearings for later this year.</p>
<p>But it isn't clear that the Democrats can succeed in
fulfilling their political aspirations with the issue. "The
problem we have as Democrats," concludes Rep. Bruce Vento
(D., Minn.), "is that a few Democrats stuck their noses in
where they didn't belong."</p>
