	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved $680 million in
loans for Venezuela to support reforms of the country's
financial sector and efforts to convert public-sector
enterprises to private ownership.
   World Bank officials said $162.5 million may be used by
the Venezuelan government to support its debt-reduction
arrangements with commercial bank creditors. This is the
second time the bank has approved a set-aside of part of its
loans to Venezuela to support debt-reduction arrangements.
Last June, also at the request of the Venezuelan government,
it set aside about $187.5 million for debt-reduction out of
$755 million in economic adjustment credits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The World Bank said the newly authorized loans included
$350 million to facilitate the transfer of many
government-owned enterprises to private owners and to
restructure the operations of other public-sector companies.</p>
<p>Another $300 million loan will support financial sector
reforms, including the privatization of several commercial
banks owned by the country's central bank. Venezuela's
Agricultural Development Bank will be liquidated. The
Industrial Bank, the country's largest public commercial
bank, and its four regional banks will be "restructured under
this operation," the World Bank said.</p>
<p>A third credit, amounting to $30 million, will help
finance technical assistance projects to strengthen the
management of several Venezuelan government ministries
involved in government financial management and investment
policy-making decisions, the World Bank said.</p>
<p>The loans are for 15 years and will carry a variable
interest rate, currently 7.75% a year.</p>
