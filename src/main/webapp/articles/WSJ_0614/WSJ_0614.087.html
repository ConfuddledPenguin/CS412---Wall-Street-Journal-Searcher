	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- KPMG Peat Marwick, the international
accounting and consulting firm, said it expects to have the
first Chinese joint accounting venture approved by the
Beijing government.
   KPMG, which supervises KPMG Peat Marwick partnerships from
here and Amsterdam, said it signed an agreement with the
Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants to
establish the firm by year end. The new firm will be called
KPMG Peat Marwick China.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new firm will provide audit services to local Chinese
companies and to Sino-foreign joint ventures. Currently, all
companies in China, including joint ventures with foreign
partners, must be audited by Chinese accounting firms, KPMG
said. If a joint venture uses a non-Chinese firm, the foreign
partner must pay the entire accounting fee.</p>
<p>KPMG established its first office in China in 1983. The
joint venture will function as a Chinese firm, KPMG said,
providing tax, audit, consultancy and other services offered
by international firms.</p>
