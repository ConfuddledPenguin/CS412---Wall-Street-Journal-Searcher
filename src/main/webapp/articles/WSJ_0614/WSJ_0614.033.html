	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency issued
rules to cut smog-forming emissions from chemical plants and
hazardous-waste facilities. The regulations will cost
industry more than $54 million a year.
   The agency has been trying since 1983 to impose certain
rules on synthetic organic chemical plants, but was delayed
during the Reagan administration by opposition from budget
officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regulations are among a series required by clean-air
and hazardous-waste laws to reduce volatile organic
chemicals, which are emitted by both industry and vehicles
and are blamed for producing smog. Smog causes health
problems and reduces visibility.</p>
<p>The proposals will require new chemical plants to cut
pollution from vents either by using new combustion equipment
or through manufacturing changes that recover and recycle
chemicals before they are vented. Certain regulations that
originally were opposed in 1983 will apply to plants built or
modified since then. The EPA estimates the changes will cost
industry $35.8 million in capital costs with annual operating
costs of $21.6 million.</p>
<p>The regulations also mark the first time the government is
regulating air pollution from hazardous-waste sites. Some
1,400 facilities that handle hazardous wastes will be
required within two years to control leaks from pumps and
valves, and in many cases to install pollution-control
equipment on vents. The agency put the cost to the industry
at $33 million to $46 million a year.</p>
<p>Agency officials said the rules shouldn't be affected by
new clean-air legislation now before Congress.</p>
