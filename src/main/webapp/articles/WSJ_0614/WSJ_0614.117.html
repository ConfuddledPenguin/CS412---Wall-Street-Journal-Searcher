financing for the acquisition of Ceco Industries Inc.,
Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.
   Robertson, a building products and contracting concern in
Pittsburgh, said it received a written commitment from Wells
Fargo Bank for $150 million of financing. In addition,
Frontera S.A., a Swiss investment company, definitively
agreed to buy $40 million of Robertson stock after the
merger.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Robertson had agreed earlier to pay $15 million cash plus
3.4 million to 4.1 million shares of Robertson common stock
for the closely held Ceco, and to assume $85 million of Ceco
debt. Following the transaction, Frontera and the current
owners of Ceco each would own about 25% of Robertson's
outstanding shares.</p>
<p>Ceco manufactures doors, metal buildings and roof systems,
and is a provider of concrete forming services.</p>
