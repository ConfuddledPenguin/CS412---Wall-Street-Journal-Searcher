	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Retail sales fell 0.7% in May, marking the
first time since 1981 that they have fallen for three
consecutive months, the Commerce Department said.
   The May decline followed drops of 0.9% in April and 0.4%
in March. Nevertheless, economists say the three-month
decline, while reflecting continued weakness in the overall
economy, doesn't necessarily foreshadow a recession.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The figures show some sign of economic weakness, but a
good part of that is just a distortion {caused by} the
weather," said Thomas Swanstrom, chief economist for Sears
Merchandise Group in Chicago. He cited unusually cool weather
in certain regions, and concluded: "I think the jury is still
out as to whether this is really some sign of economic
weakness or if this is just some type of aberration."</p>
<p>Departing somewhat from Mr. Swanstrom's view, Rosalind
Wells, chief economist for National Retail Federation, said,
"It is hard to keep blaming it {the drop} on the weather. The
weakness is pretty widespread . . . which indicates an
overall weakening in the economy."</p>
<p>Analyst did agree that the decline indicates consumers
have become more cautious in the past few months due to a
slowdown in employment growth and a slump in home sales and
prices.</p>
<p>May's drop in sales, just as the April decline, was
widespread with declines in all sales categories except
apparel.</p>
<p>Auto sales fell 0.6% in May compared with a 1.6% decline
in April. Hardware and building material purchases tumbled
4.2% after diving 3.2% in April. Furniture sales dropped 1.1%
after rising 0.5% the month before. Sales at general
merchandise department stores fell 1% after declining 2.1% in
April. However, apparel sales jumped 2.4% after falling a
like percentage a month earlier.</p>
<p>Excluding auto sales, which tend to vary widely from month
to month, retail sales were down 0.8% in May after dropping
0.7% in April.</p>
<p>But some analysts were skeptical that the overall May
sales decline was as sharp as the department figures suggest.
"I would not be surprised if the revised numbers aren't quite
as bad as these figures indicate," said Ms. Wells.</p>
<p>She also suggested that sales may rise later this year
compared with the May figures. "It is not a glowing sales
report, and it should be taken seriously. . . . But I expect
retail sales to improve as the year goes on," she said.</p>
<p>Retail purchases totaled $146.84 billion in May after
adjusting for seasonal flucuations, compared with total sales
of $147.93 billion in April.</p>
<p>The department's estimates are based on a relatively small
sample of reports and frequently are revised significantly as
more data are collected. The numbers exclude spending on
services, which account for a large portion of consumer
outlays. But retail sales account for about one-third of the
country's economic activity, and thus those figures are
closely watched by economists.</p>
