	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Eight former employees of Grand Wilshire
Group, one of California's largest minority-owned businesses
that owned about 25 car dealerships before it collapsed in
1988, were charged with defrauding numerous lenders out of
about $50 million.
   Glendora, Calif.-based Grand Wilshire was controlled by
Eminiano (Jun) Reodica Jr., a Philippine immigrant who
disappeared two years ago after the company came under
investigation, said U.S. Attorney Ronni B. MacLaren, who is
prosecuting the case.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Reodica, who wasn't named in the criminal information
filed in U.S. District Court here, is still under
investigation, Ms. MacLaren said.</p>
<p>The employees, including an accounting manager, two
operations managers, and Mr. Reodica's personal secretary,
face various charges related to their roles in the alleged
scheme to use customer-loan contracts improperly as
collateral to secure huge credit lines for the dealerships.</p>
<p>The employees deleted negative credit information from
customers' credit reports, submitted the same contracts as
collateral to as many as three different lenders, and hid
customers' failure to make their car payments, the
information said. Imperial Savings Association in San Diego,
First Los Angeles Bank, and General Electric Capital Corp.
were among the allegedly victimized lenders.</p>
<p>If convicted, the eight defendants face maximum penalties
ranging from five to 25 years in prison and fines of $250,000
to $1,250,000, Ms. MacLaren said.</p>
