	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Woolworth Corp., a retailer, said it is
raising its capital spending budget for the year ending Jan.
26, 1991, to $365 million from the $325 million it allotted
earlier. The new sum, which represents a 15% increase from
the $315 million in capital outlays a year earlier, will be
used primarily to open 825 new stores, up from 735 announced
earlier.
   More than 90% of the new sites will be specialty stores,
such as Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Mart, Champs
Sports, and Afterthoughts/Carimar.</p>
