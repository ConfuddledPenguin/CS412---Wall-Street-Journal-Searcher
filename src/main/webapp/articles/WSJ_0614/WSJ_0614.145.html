	<p class="article-leader">Corporacion Mapfre S.A., Spain's leading insurer, said in
Madrid that it agreed to buy a majority stake in Puerto
Rico's biggest insurance group from Continental Corp. of the
U.S. for $100 million.
   Mapfre officials said the purchase is Mapfre's biggest
foreign acquisition to date and is part of a strategy to
expand the group's trans-Atlantic operations. More than half
of Mapfre's international business is in Latin America; it
also has a small operation in the U.S. It plans to use its
Puerto Rican presence to expand its activities in the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement with Continental, Mapfre plans to set
up a subsidiary in Puerto Rico to take a stake in the
insurance business of Puerto Rican American Insurance Co, or
Praico, and in some of its assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>The Praico assets concerned include two subsidiaries,
Preferred Risk, a general insurance company, and Security
National Life Insurance Co., a life insurance specialist.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Mapfre's subsidiary Mapfre Internacional
will take a majority stake in Panamerican Corp., a holding
company that controls Pan American Insurance Co, Pan American
Finance Corp. and Puerto Rican Insurance Agency.</p>
<p>Together, these firms form the Praico group, Puerto Rico's
biggest insurer with gross 1989 premium revenues of $83.5
million. Mapfre said it plans to finance the investment
through an issue of new shares.</p>
