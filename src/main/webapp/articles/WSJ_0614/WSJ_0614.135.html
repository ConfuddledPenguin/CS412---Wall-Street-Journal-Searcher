	<p class="article-leader">Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB confirmed that it has
withdrawn from a planned joint takeover with Finland's
Kymmene Oy of French forest products group Chapelle Darblay
S.A.
   Stora, the large Swedish pulp and paper concern, said its
pending 4 billion mark ($2.4 million) acquisition of West
Germany's Feldmuehle Nobel AG would have posed potential
antitrust difficulties in both France and West Germany for
the purchase of a 50% stake in Chapelle Darblay. Stora denied
that it pulled out under pressure from the French government
or at the request of West German antitrust authorities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The French Economics Ministry approved the sale of
Chapelle Darblay to Kymmene alone. Officials said Stora had
informed Kymmene and French authorities as early as mid-May
they wouldn't proceed with the purchase.</p>
<p>Officials said Kymmene exercised a clause in the accord
giving them the right of first refusal to Stora's stake.</p>
<p>The purchase price for Chapelle Darblay was 1.32 billion
French francs ($231.2 million).</p>
