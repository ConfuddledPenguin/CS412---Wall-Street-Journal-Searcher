	<h3>Battle for Listings May Follow Ruling On `1 Share, 1 Vote' --- Big Board, Most Vulnerable, May Adjust Requirement Due to Court's Decision</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">A major court ruling striking down the Securities and
Exchange Commission's "one-share, one-vote" rule could
reignite a war among U.S. stock exchanges over which one gets
to list the shares of major American corporations.
   Although exchanges were reluctant to tip their hands
yesterday, people familiar with exchange rule-making say
listing requirements may be rapidly adjusted to attract an
expected round of new stock issues by companies seeking to
create several classes of stock with different voting rights,
principally as an anti-takeover defense.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most at risk is the New York Stock Exchange, which
currently has a rule on its books that, with some exceptions,
prevents companies from listing new shares of stock that have
different voting rights.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down SEC rule 19c4,
which required corporations to have equal voting rights for
different classes of stock. A rule similar to 19c4 has been
incorporated into the New York Stock Exchange's rule books.</p>
<p>With the court decision, many companies could seek to
create multiple classes of stock with different voting
rights. But they are potentially barred from listing these
new shares on the Big Board because of its current rules.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange and the National Association
of Securities Dealers Nasdaq over-the-counter market never
adopted a version of 19c4 for their rule books, according to
one attorney familiar with the exchanges. "Companies traded
on the American Stock Exchange or the NASD are no longer
subject to the SEC's regulation of the allocation of voting
rights among shareholders," said Robert D. Rosenbaum, and
counsel for the Business Roundtable, which successfully
challenged the SEC.</p>
<p>Meredith Brown, head of mergers and acquisitions at
Debevoise & Plimpton said: "The question is, `Will there be a
race among {exchanges} for greater permissiveness?'"</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, the Amex and Nasdaq used their more
liberal listing requirements to try to lure from the Big
Board companies seeking to create classes of stock with
different voting rights. That fight ultimately led the SEC to
enact its rule requiring one-share, one-vote for companies
that didn't already have multiple stock classes.</p>
<p>Now, in order to compete with rival exchanges, it could
"be necessary for {the Big Board} to amend its own rules to
eliminate the effect of rule 19c4," Mr. Rosenbaum said.</p>
<p>Perhaps not. Some people familiar with the SEC think the
agency may try to abort the battle by cajoling exchanges into
adopting uniform listing regulations.</p>
