	<p class="article-leader">Program trading has been the object of much scrutiny and
some hostility since the October 1987 stock crash. This week,
a New York Stock Exchange panel found that a form of program
trading known as stock-index arbitrage is a normal function
of the marketplace. At the same time, though, a majority of
the panel also backed curbs on the process. The proposal
follows close on the heels of last month's criticism of
stock-index arbitrage by the market regulation division of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC, repeating a
conclusion it came to after the 1987 crash, said that index
arbitrage had "accelerated and exacerbated" the decline.
   Not everyone, however, shares this view. Some have
criticized the fact that the SEC report was largely produced
by lawyers. The SEC's own Office of Economic Analysis --
economists -- played little role in preparing the
commission's report and has been quiet on the issue. The
question can be asked: Why would the SEC, widely viewed as
having a first-rate staff of economists, choose a group of
lawyers to examine price movements in turbulent markets? The
issue is one of statistics and economics, not law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regardless of SEC politics, though, there is a strong
economic argument to be made against blaming program trading
for market movement. In economic research of program trading,
first at the SEC, and later at the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, I've come up with conclusions quite different
from those reported by the SEC lawyers.</p>
<p>In a study issued by the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis
in 1988, I reported that on Oct. 19, 1987, the times of heavy
program-trading volume were not, systematically, the times
when prices fell the most. In fact, from 1 to 4 p.m.,
above-average price changes tended to occur when
index-arbitrage volume was below average. During that time
the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined twice as fast as it
had in the previous 3 1/2 hours. The precipitous price
declines occurred when the normal index-arbitrage relation
was most disrupted, not when index arbitrage was most
prevalent.</p>
<p>Program trading and its principal subset, index arbitrage,
must rank among the most widely misunderstood financial
terms. A program trade is simply a trade in a basket of
stocks. Program traders do not relinquish control to
computers. In fact, program trading was in use before it was
associated with computers.</p>
<p>Index arbitrage, which generally accounts for about half
of program-trading volume, is triggered when prices in
futures and options markets stray from their fair-value
relation to stock prices. Simple math defines the relation.
If the futures price falls below its fair-value relation to
the stock price, index arbitragers go to work-buying futures
and selling stock. Their work shares a crucial feature with
most work: It is privately motivated, and its public effects
are as salutary as they are unintended. As Adam Smith said,
more than 200 years ago, "it is not from the benevolence of
the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, {or the index
arbitrager} that we expect our dinner, but from their regard
to their own interest."</p>
<p>In this case, "dinner" is linked markets. Linkage is not
an end in itself, but is necessary for liquidity to be
available in related markets. Like telephones, two related
markets cannot both function if the link is missing. The
ruble is essentially worthless on world currency markets
because the market link is missing. Similarly the stock-index
futures market cannot supply its product, liquidity, if the
index-arbitrage link is missing. In a liquid market investors
can trade when they want, without paying a lot for the trade.
In an illiquid market -- one that has become unlinked --
investors must either wait to trade or accept a large adverse
price movement. Therefore markets are more stable -- are less
liable to experience large price movements -- when index
arbitrage is allowed to operate.</p>
<p>Generally, price movements in stock and futures markets
trigger index-arbitrage trading, which realigns prices. So
index arbitrage is generally positively correlated with price
movements; stock prices fall when index arbitragers sell
stocks. But the distinction between correlation and causality
is critical here. Don't blame the fuel gauge when you run out
of gas.</p>
<p>In the stock and futures markets, price is the outcome of
a market process in which traders do not cause price changes,
but are agents who translate information into prices. For
example, when orange crops freeze, traders buy orange juice
futures, scrambling to acquire some of the now scarce future
supply of orange juice. Traders buy, and orange juice prices
rise, but orange juice traders aren't blamed for causing
higher orange juice prices. Similarly, index arbitragers
shouldn't be blamed or credited for changing stock prices.</p>
<p>Apply this to the market decline on Oct. 13, 1989. A CFTC
report, the bulk of which was produced by the Division of
Economic Analysis, shows that index arbitrage was positively
correlated with price movements. There is good reason,
however, to believe that information, not index arbitrage
drove the decline. Stock prices began to tumble moments after
two news items were released almost simultaneously. The first
was news that a legislative proposal to cut the capital-gains
tax rate had been defeated in Congress; and the second was
news that financing for a buy-out of United Airlines was in
doubt, which implicated the effectiveness of the junk bond
market, the key vehicle for financing corporate takeovers and
leveraged buy-outs.</p>
<p>Following the news, prices began to fall -- and, as
always, fell faster in the stock-index futures markets than
in the stock markets. As futures became cheap relative to
stocks, index arbitragers stepped in to buy futures and sell
stocks, with the effect of realigning prices and allowing
both markets to provide liquidity to investors. Some
exchanges had adopted "shock absorbers," which limited price
movement after prices fell about 100 Dow points. There is
evidence that when these limits were reached, volume migrated
to other exchanges, thereby increasing their liquidity
strains and price volatility. These uncoordinated shock
absorbers, not the presence of index arbitrage, are likely to
have "accelerated and exacerbated" the decline.</p>
<p>The importance of index arbitrage is indirectly due to
fundamental changes over the past 25 years in the way
individuals hold stocks. Investors have grown to understand
that trading a diverse portfolio of stocks earns them a
higher return for a given level of risk. Rather than trade a
few stocks directly through a retail broker, investors are
now more likely to hold stocks indirectly through a mutual
fund or a pension fund. These funds trade stock programs and
use futures and options markets to lower costs and increase
returns. Individual investors are not fleeing the stock
market; they are holding their stocks indirectly, through
professionally managed mutual funds and pension funds.</p>
<p>Index arbitrage is the expected byproduct of the existence
of related markets that serve these funds. Its presence is
completely natural and it is essential to the integrity of
the marketplace. Inhibiting index arbitrage in any way
damages the structure of securities trading in the U.S.</p>
