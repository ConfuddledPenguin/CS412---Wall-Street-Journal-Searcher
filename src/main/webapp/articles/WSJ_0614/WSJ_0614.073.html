	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In any booming market, a rising tide lifts all
boats, even the leaky ones.
   But with the froth off the art market (anywhere from 20%
to 45% of the paintings went unsold at recent auctions),
dealers, auction houses and the rest of the art-selling
industry are retooling for a climate in which sales are
harder to come by.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the stock market, when the blue chips are topped out,
brokers scurry to find "undervalued" stocks. Similarly, art
dealers and auction houses are gearing up aggressive
marketing campaigns to attract attention, cash and cachet for
"undervalued" sectors of the art market.</p>
<p>Samuel Pennington, editor of the "Maine Antique Digest,"
said it's a "fallacy" to think there's a single art market
that "is like the stock market and goes up or down." He
argued that several separate markets exist, some sagging,
like plain blanket chests and other country furniture that
were trendy in the early 1980s, while others, like antique
toys, surge.</p>
<p>Said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's
International PLC's big U.S. auction house, "It's really 40
little separate businesses that we run."</p>
<p>So what's trendy?</p>
<p>ANTIQUITIES</p>
<p>Perhaps Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s greatest expectations
for the next trendy sector are Greek and Roman antiquities --
marble and bronze statues and vases roughly 2,000 years old.</p>
<p>It's no accident that the New York-based auction house has
gone to great lengths to generate excitement over its sale
next week of the antiquities collections of William and
Nelson Hunt, the onetime Dallas billionaire brothers whose
businesses have been in bankruptcy-law proceedings. One of
the highlights is a Roman bronze of a naked youth from the
second century A.D. estimated to sell for as much as $1.2
million. All told, Sotheby's estimates that the Hunts'
antiquities and ancient coins will fetch $20 million.</p>
<p>"We've trucked {the Hunt collections} all over the world,"
said John Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America and its
chief auctioneer. He said Sotheby's is counting on
"crossover: People interested in antique cars might be in
antiquities."</p>
<p>Wall Street also is betting on an antiquities boom.
Merrill Lynch & Co., which launched an "Athena II" art
limited partnership in October 1988, has invested roughly $5
million of the proceeds in antiquities, purchasing well over
100 vases, small bronzes and marble sculptures, according to
Frank J. Carr, the partnership's chief investment officer.</p>
<p>Look at "the prices being paid for paintings, and look at
2,000-year-old, extremely rare antiquities; the prices are a
fraction," said Mr. Carr. "We see a catching-up. It's an
undervalued situation." Next week's Hunt sale, he said, will
be "very positive for the industry" because it will "focus
attention" on the market.</p>
<p>Asher Edelman, the Wall Street raider and well-known
collector of modern art, is a principal backer of a New
York-based antiquities gallery, Daedalus Gallery, that opened
late last year. He declined to comment.</p>
<p>But antiquities collecting has its pitfalls. Fakes are
rampant, and pieces are difficult to authenticate. This area,
more than some others, "takes a lot of research," warned
Sotheby's Mr. Marion.</p>
<p>PHOTOGRAPHY</p>
<p>The willingness of museums like New York's Museum of
Modern Art and of corporations like Ford Motor Co. to take
photography seriously as an art form has given a tremendous
boost to prices of photographs. So has the controversy
surrounding the work of the late photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe.</p>
<p>According to "The Photograph Collector" newsletter, asking
prices for works by prominent photographers ranging from
$1,000 to $100,000 aren't uncommon. They have replaced the
$100 to $1,000 asking prices of the early 1980s.</p>
<p>For example, of the 43 top lots offered at Sotheby's,
Christie's and New York's Swann Galleries in a series of
photography sales late last year, all but three sold over
their highest pre-sale estimates. A handful of them sold at
double or triple their estimates, with a record $396,000 paid
for a group of 21 prints by Alfred Stieglitz. But it's still
an affordable market for the novice collector, with many
high-quality prints selling for less than $20,000.</p>
<p>Other photographers whose works have appreciated rapidly
over the last decade include Man Ray, Margaret Bourke-White,
William Wegman and Cindy Sherman. The most sought-after
photographs are those printed during the artist's lifetime as
part of a signed, limited edition.</p>
<p>TOYS</p>
<p>While toys are technically collectibles, rather than fine
art, their recent rate of appreciation has more in common
with Picasso than Depression glassware.</p>
<p>Dale Kelley, publisher of Antique Toy World magazine,
said, "In the last three years, it's gone crazy. Everything
is hot."</p>
<p>A rare, German-made bisque doll from 1909 sold for
$170,000. At the lower end of the market, "The Game of the
Man in the Moon," a board game manufactured in 1901, sold for
$4,600 at the Skinner auction house in Bolton, Mass. Dealers
say prices of turn-of-the-century cast-iron toys, banks and
robots are escalating most sharply.</p>
<p>Part of the frenzy of the toy market may be caused by the
unusual tactics of one of its dealers, Alexander Galleries.
Instead of the typical genteel auctions, the New York-based
gallery has held successful sales at which, at the sound of a
whistle, potential buyers race across the room to affix
stickers to photos of toys that have already been marked with
prices. The most recent sale of this type raised $1.3 million
for 982 toys, with a top price of $125,000 paid for a fire
engine made in 1870.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>But as some sectors of the art market heat up, others are
cooling off. Here's what's isn't trendy:</p>
<p>CONTEMPORARY ART</p>
<p>Contemporary paintings and sculptures, generally
considered to be art produced in the post-war period, have
been primarily bought by U.S. collectors. But dealers said
U.S. collectors have grown more conservative recently. At a
series of contemporary-art auctions last month, roughly
one-third of the paintings and sculptures failed to find
buyers.</p>
<p>Again and again, collectors and dealers proved willing to
buy pieces in the low six figures, but balked at crossing the
$1 million threshold for established artists like Willem de
Kooning, Richard Diebenkorn and Morris Louis. Moreover, the
sheer volume of works on the market by comic-book stylist Roy
Lichtenstein and pop-art master Andy Warhol tended to
undercut the prices their lesser works fetched. And artists
now viewed as derivative, Donald Sultan, for example, whose
giant flowers seem reminiscent of Mr. Warhol, didn't find
takers at the expected prices.</p>
<p>IMPRESSIONIST, MODERN</p>
<p>In the impressionist and modern painting sectors, the
standard against which all others are measured, there's been
a slowdown in the 30%-plus annual rate of appreciation. That
is likely to result in a shakeout of art-market speculators
accustomed to making big profits from quick resales of
artworks.</p>
<p>The record prices set by a handful of true masterpieces
may have obscured the market's softening. But the same week a
painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir sold for $78.1 million at
Sotheby's, more than a dozen other Renoirs came on the block.
The more pedestrian Renoirs of fleshy, red-cheeked women sold
for far less than their estimates, or didn't sell at all.
Similarly, so many Marc Chagalls have surfaced at auction
that buyers could afford to be choosy.</p>
<p>Collectors have tired of sun-dappled garden scenes by
second-rate painters such as Henri Le Sidanier or sketches of
Parisian streets by Maurice Utrillo. Even for impressionist
masters, increasingly selective buyers bypassed
poorer-quality Camille Pissarros and Alfred Sisleys or paid
prices $200,000 or so below the auction-house estimates.</p>
<p>Prices for works by American impressionists, which had
benefited handsomely from the run-up in prices of their
French counterparts, also appear to be leveling off. At
recent auctions, works by Childe Hassam and Frederick
Frieseke have failed to sell.</p>
<p>SOVIET ART</p>
<p>Two years ago, when Sotheby's held an auction in Moscow of
120 works of contemporary Soviet art, several of the
paintings and sculptures sold for double or triple their
six-figure estimates. Only 5% of the works didn't sell.</p>
<p>The sale energized the market for Soviet art, which
swiftly became all the rage, with nearly a dozen New York
galleries showcasing it in the past year. But more recent
auctions of East-bloc art have met with a chillier response.
Concerns about the fakes rampant in the difficult-to-document
field of early 20th-century avant-garde Soviet art and the
faddish nature of its recent popularity appear to have damped
interest.</p>
<p>At an April auction of the works of Soviet avant-garde
artists, early 20th-century masters deemed to be the cream of
the crop, buyers proved unwilling to bid in line with the
six-figure and seven-figure pre-sale estimates set by
Sotheby's. The estimates assumed that record prices would be
set for the artists.</p>
<p>Similarly at Habsburg, Feldman Auctioneers Inc., the New
York arm of the Geneva-based auction gallery, 56 of the 121
art works by contemporary Soviet artists up for bid last
month failed to sell. Moreover, with the death of premiere
Faberge egg collector Malcolm Forbes, that market, which
sometimes achieved its record prices as a result of Mr.
Forbes bidding directly against the Kremlin, is seen
softening.</p>
