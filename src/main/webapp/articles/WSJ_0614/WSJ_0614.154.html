	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Negotiators for the three major broadcast
networks and Hollywood's major studios broke off all talks
aimed at reaching a compromise on how to ease federal
regulations blocking the networks from the $3 billion-a-year
syndication business.
   The collapse of the private talks yesterday shifts the
battle over the rerun business to Washington and the Federal
Communications Commission, a destination that both sides had
hoped to avoid. The breakdown came as the FCC was preparing
to begin a formal review of the so-called Financial Interest
and Syndication Rules with an eye toward imposing an FCC plan
for easing the restrictions, unless Hollywood and the
networks were able to agree on a plan of their own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Various parties in the fight over whether the networks
should be allowed to share in rerun profits will file
arguments to the FCC today.</p>
<p>The networks had been willing to "live with something less
than the complete elimination of the rerun rules" if a
compromise with the studios could have been reached, said
Stephen A. Weiswasser, general counsel of Capital Cities/ABC
Inc. and the lead negotiator for the networks. But with the
collapse of the talks yesterday, all three major networks now
are likely to argue for a wholesale scuttling of the rerun
rules when they make their FCC filings today, he said.</p>
<p>Officials from both sides met with FCC Chairman Alfred
Sikes a week ago to apprise him of the lack of progress made
in the negotiations. Negotiators for the studios, led by
Warner Bros. Chairman Bob Daly, then asked the FCC to extend
its June 14 deadline for filings on the rerun issue. That
would have given the networks and the production companies
that supply most prime-time programming more time to craft a
solution of their own making.</p>
<p>But network officials opposed extending the deadline as a
way to turn up the heat on the studios and perhaps push them
into a compromise -- a move that backfired yesterday as the
FCC deadline drew near.</p>
<p>Both sides were supposed to meet on Tuesday of this week,
but Hollywood negotiators backed out and said that -- because
the networks hadn't agreed to a deadline extension -- they
were busy preparing their FCC filings. Then Mr. Weiswasser
and Mr. Daly of Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. studio met
one-on-one later Tuesday night, huddling in a bar at the
Century Plaza for almost three hours.</p>
<p>There, the two negotiators came up with a rough outline
for how the rerun rules might be eased and were hopeful the
talks could reconvene yesterday morning. But the session
never took place, and accounts differ as to why.</p>
<p>Mr. Weiswasser of ABC said the producers asked for "all
kinds of preconditions" before sitting down for an
eleventh-hour session, and network negotiators were unwilling
to go along. But Warner's Mr. Daly countered that the
preconditions -- an agreement to limit the talks to only
certain major points and leave other areas off the table --
were Mr. Weiswasser's idea. "What happened, bottom line, is
he just couldn't deliver his team," and officials of the
other networks wouldn't go along, Mr. Daly said.</p>
<p>When the two sides couldn't even agree on the ground rules
for their final meeting set before the FCC deadline today,
they canceled the session altogether.</p>
<p>Both sides now run a risk in letting the negotiations
falter and throwing the nettlesome issue to the FCC. But
network officials have less to lose because the rerun rules,
as they exist, don't offer the networks any piece of the
lucrative rerun business.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Sikes seems intent on giving the networks
some relief from the rules, which were first imposed in 1970
at a time when the Big Three controlled over 90% of the
viewing audience. The networks have argued loudly for killing
the restrictions now that their share of the TV audience is
down to a combined 65% and in light of the mergers of such
huge rivals as Time Warner Inc. and acquisitions of U.S.
studios by such foreign rivals as Sony Corp.</p>
<p>In the one-on-one meeting Tuesday night, Mr. Daly and Mr.
Weiswasser agreed to narrow the negotiations to a limit on
in-house series production at the networks; a limit on how
many made-for-TV movies the networks would produce
themselves; and language that would stop the networks from
demanding ownership stakes from producers.</p>
<p>But Mr. Daly called the next morning with new specifics
and a new demand: before sitting down, the networks would
have to agree to cut, by half, the number of movies they make
in-house. Mr. Weiswasser called back an hour later with the
networks' verdict: "no preconditions." Mr. Daly countered:
"OK, no meeting," according to Mr. Weiswasser. Mr. Daly
concedes making some new demands but said the networks were
unwilling to narrow the talks in the way he and Mr.
Weiswasser had agreed.</p>
<p>No further meetings between the two sides are scheduled,
as the FCC today receives opinion filings on whether the
rerun restrictions should be changed. The panel may come up
with a new plan governing the rerun business by year-end.</p>
