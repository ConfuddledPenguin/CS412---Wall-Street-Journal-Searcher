	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Varity Corp. took the first step toward
improving the trading value of its common shares, announcing
that it will seek shareholder approval to reduce the number
of preferred shares outstanding.
   The industrial products concern said it may offer holders
of preferred shares cash or common shares in return for their
stakes in the company, reducing the number of preferred
shares outstanding and its annual dividend obligations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year ended Jan. 31, 1990, Varity said it paid
dividends totaling about $18.7 million to holders of the 11.8
million Class 1 and two million Class 2 preferred shares.</p>
<p>The company has said often that it regards the existence
of the preferred shares, and the substantial dividend
payments, as "a major impediment" to further improvement in
the trading value of its common shares as well as its
earnings.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990, Varity reported net income of $92.1
million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $2.38 billion. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
Varity's common closed at $3, off 12.5 cents, on volume of
451,100 shares.</p>
<p>Varity said its board hasn't decided whether or when such
proposals would be made, or what form they would take.
Currently, the company has about 249 million common shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>It said shareholders will vote on the amendments at the
annual meeting July 30. The amendments must be approved by
two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of common shares,
Class 1 shares and Class 2 shares, each voting separately as
a class or series.</p>
<p>Jack R. Nowling, a Varity spokesman, said the company is
still considering "a number of measures" to increase value
for common shareholders, apart from the conversion of the
preferred shares.</p>
<p>He said those measures could include a common share
buy-back, making use of the $275.5 million of cash the
company had as of April 30. But he added that any
announcements regarding moves to improve value for common
shareholders aren't likely to be made until the annual
meeting.</p>
