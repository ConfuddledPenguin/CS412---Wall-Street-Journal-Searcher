	<p class="article-leader">In Indiana, where no black has ever served as a federal
judge, a coalition of black lawyers and civil rights groups
is battling to get blacks appointed to both federal and state
courts.
   The three-year-old coalition has fielded picketers at
federal buildings and courthouses and plans to picket the
statehouse on July 4.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The system doesn't work," says coalition leader Hilbert
L. Bradley, an attorney based in Gary, Ind. "Indiana has a
dismal record when you compare it to Deep South states with
histories of discrimination, segregation and racism."</p>
<p>Nationally, 48 blacks currently sit as federal judges,
serving in 22 states, plus the District of Columbia and the
Virgin Islands. Twenty-seven states in addition to Indiana
have no black federal judges. The District of Columbia leads
the nation with seven, and California follows with six. There
are 753 federal judgeships nationally.</p>
<p>As a rule, U.S. senators from the president's party play a
crucial role in the selection of federal district judges,
submitting their choices to the Justice Department and the
White House. In Indiana, each senator has three
representatives on a 10-member judicial selection committee.
Spokesmen for Indiana senators Richard Lugar and Daniel
Coats, both Republicans, say the committee has helped in the
selection of a woman and a Hispanic to the federal bench in
Indiana. Currently, there are no openings.</p>
<p>Both Indiana senators have met with the Bradley coalition
but insist that they will not deviate from the current
selection process, which they say is fair.</p>
<p>The coalition appears to be making a little more headway
on the state level, where there currently are three black
judges, all at the lowest trial court level. Six blacks have
submitted their names to a nine-member state judicial
nominating committee for three judgeships on a recently
established district court. Mr. Bradley says he expects to
hear from the committee by the fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradley says the dearth of black judges in Indiana is
particularly alarming because about 10% of the state's
population is black. Blacks make up about 25% of the Lake
County's population, which includes the predominantly black
city of Gary. Gary was one of the first cities to elect a
black mayor, Richard Hatcher, in the 1960s. Mr. Hatcher, now
a lawyer in private practice, is one of the several blacks
qualified for a state or federal judgeship, Mr. Bradley says.</p>
<p>White House Personnel Director Chase Untermeyer said
President Bush, while rejecting quotas, seeks diversity on
the federal bench as well as in the rest of the government.
However, for federal district court judges, Mr. Untermeyer
says, "the pool is pretty much determined by what the
senators or party leaders are sending over."</p>
<p>Mr. Untermeyer adds that it's more difficult to get
minorities for judicial posts than to get whites because "by
statistics, minorities tend to be Democrats. But it's not
impossible. It's a big country and there are a lot of able
people."</p>
<p>Mr. Untermeyer ticked off the names of six black judicial
nominees (none of them from Indiana), whom Mr. Bush has sent
to the Senate for confirmation thus far.</p>

<p>PHYSICIAN IN AIDS CASE hit with $26.9 million judgment.</p>
<p>Arizona state district judge David R. Cole's entered
judgment formalizing an earlier jury verdict in favor of
Alexander Edwards, a five-year-old boy who contracted
acquired immune deficiency syndrome through a blood
transfusion. The judgment is believed to be among the largest
ever imposed in an AIDS-related case.</p>
<p>Held liable were Dr. Abraham Kuruvilla, a Phoenix
physician, and Neonatology Associates Ltd., the medical
clinic where he practices. The boy's parents, Roy and
Patricia Edwards, had brought suit alleging negligence in
connection with a blood transfusion given their son shortly
after his birth. The AIDS virus was contained in plasma used
in the transfusion. The plaintiffs contended that the
transfusion was unnecessary and was given without consent
from the boy's parents.</p>
<p>A jury in Phoenix awarded the plaintiffs $28.8 million,
including $1 million for each of the parents and the balance
for their son. The judge's order reduced the amount slightly,
apparently to reflect previous out-of-court settlements
involving other defendants in the case.</p>
<p>R. Douglas Dalton, an attorney with Meyer, Hendricks,
Victor, Osborn & Maledon, counsel for the plaintiffs, said
the verdict may make physicians "more careful" in using blood
products, and in involving parents in decisions on blood
transfusions. But a spokesman for the Arizona Medical
Association said physicians are outraged by the case. He said
the association is organizing a rally of physicians at the
state capital to protest the verdict and lobby for new laws
to prevent future cases.</p>
<p>Duane Olson, an attorney with Weyl, Guyer, Macban & Olson
in Phoenix, counsel for Dr. Kuruvilla and the clinic, said
he'll seek to overturn the verdict. "I'll feel like the
system broke down if this doesn't get undone," he said.</p>

<p>WISCONSIN MAY ABANDON mandatory bar membership.</p>
<p>The chief justice of Wisconsin's highest court said the
state may drop its requirement that all lawyers practicing in
Wisconsin join the state bar. The announcement came in
response to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last week that
state bars with mandatory membership rules must refund dues
spent on activities unrelated to legal practice.</p>
<p>About 30 states require lawyers to join their state bar,
and many of these use members' compulsory dues to fund
lobbying and political activity. The Wisconsin Supreme Court,
which supervises the state bar, had already made bar
membership voluntary temporarily, pending release of the U.S.
Supreme Court ruling.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Wisconsin state bar said Chief Justice
Nathan Heffernan appears to be concerned about the
administrative burden of deciding how a state bar with
mandatory membership can spend its money while complying with
the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Justice Heffernan couldn't
be reached for comment.</p>
<p>But Amedeo Greco, a Wisconsin lawyer who has sued the
state bar to recoup dues money spent on lobbying, says the
state bar may seek to make membership voluntary because it
does not want to lose the right to lobby.</p>

<p>CAREER MOVE: Tom A. Alberg, a partner at the law firm of
Perkins Coie in Seattle, will become executive vice president
for legal and corporate affairs at McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc., effective July 1. Mr. Alberg, 50 years
old, was executive committee chairman at 330-lawyer Perkins
Coie. He said he is switching to the in-house post at McCaw,
a cellular telephone company based in Kirkland, Wa., because
"it's a challenging industry and maybe to do something
different. I've been on the law firm side a long time."</p>
