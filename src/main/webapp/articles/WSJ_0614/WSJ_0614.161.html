	<p class="article-leader">The weakness of the dollar against the French franc is
likely to foster a yet unspecified decline in Pechiney
International S.A.'s consolidated net income for 1990, a
spokesman for the French-controlled packaging and aluminum
company said.
   The official said the anticipated decline would mainly
reflect the fact that most of the company's revenue is in
dollars while its annual accounts are expressed in francs.
This is an important element because the U.S. currency has
averaged 5.70 francs so far this year, compared with the
6.38-franc exchange rate used in its accounts for 1989, he
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Another factor weighing on the company's results so far
this year has been weak aluminum prices, which could trim
results for this branch in dollar terms, the spokesman said.
Narrowly lower profits are also anticipated from the group's
electrical parts operations, he said, but added that it was
too early to speculate on the scope of the anticipated
declines because they hinge on the dollar's performance over
the rest of the year.</p>
