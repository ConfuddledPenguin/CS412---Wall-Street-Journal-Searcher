   The Savage M.B.A.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>COULD the corporate jungle become a tranquil glen?</p>
<p>Yes, predict some students of organizational science who
see an ebbing in that favorite pastime, office politics.
Zandy Leibowitz, president of Conceptual Systems, a Silver
Spring, Md., consulting firm, believes the 1990s "will be the
era of competence," with success based on masterful
performance, not mastery of Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Employers are realizing the corporate jungle is more
self-fulfilling prophecy than necessity, claims Jonathan
Klein, assistant professor at Rutgers University. People
aren't power-mongering by nature, he argues, but learn
"pre-emptive, political behavior." Mr. Klein puts his
organization class through exercises to illustrate that while
at first one is "richly rewarded for knifing {people} in the
back," retaliation follows, trust is lost, and productivity
declines.</p>
<p>Sally Helgesen, author of "The Female Advantage," argues
that the advent of women managers will help curb politics.
The corporate ladder is a male model, she contends,
reflecting that men often want distance between themselves
and underlings. Women, she argues, are more likely to create
a management "web" that draws people together.</p>
<p>"Leaner and meaner" organizations also could actually
bring relief. That's because companies with fewer layers of
managers must redistribute the power. Xerox, for example, is
encouraging teamwork and evaluating performance in ways
designed to override old-boy loyalties.</p>
<p>Politicking still thrives at most corporations, often
exacerbated by the takeover atmosphere, consultants
acknowledge. Still, asserts Ms. Helgesen, aggressive
opportunism has "an obsolete, '80s elitist feel to it."</p>
<p>Congress May Rescue</p>
<p>Seniors' Job Benefits</p>
<p>CONGRESS IS CLOSE to tackling a billion-dollar issue:
Employers' right to discriminate against older workers in
paying benefits.</p>
<p>The bill would overturn the 1989 Supreme Court ruling that
allowed employers to tell older workers something like: "You
won't get as much life, health or disability insurance as
your younger colleagues. It just costs us too much." For two
decades, age-discrimination laws were applied to benefits as
well as employment issues. But the court's "Betts" ruling
gave employers "great freedom," says Henry Saveth, a benefits
consultant.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would largely restore things the way
they were, resolving some pending cases. One involves
Westinghouse plant closings where younger employees got
severance pay and pension, while those above 60 got only
pension. The law also would make some apparent concessions to
employers, including giving them clear license to reduce
older workers' severance in an early-retirement window if
they paid retiree health benefits. But Mr. Saveth believes
the bill would also make such windows harder to execute,
leading more employers simply to fire people.</p>
<p>The bill is likely to come on the floor in the next six
weeks and bipartisan sponsors expect it to be passed. But
employers have stepped up their lobbying, and the White House
has become a wild card. While the Justice Department argued
against the Betts decision, and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission helped draft the bill, the
administration recently hinted at a veto.</p>
<p>Whose Mission Is It?</p>
<p>You Should Know</p>
<p>PULL OUT your handy corporate mission statement, and read
carefully.</p>
<p>If you tally the pronouns and words like "should" and
"might," you'll have a reading of your company that goes
beyond the gussied-up talk of values, says a University of
Michigan study.</p>
<p>Profs. Priscilla Rogers and John Swales reviewed 80
mission statements to determine how well-chosen words set the
mood. Statements that use mostly "you" have a
"laying-down-the-law" flavor, and tend to use a lot of
"shoulds," notes Ms. Rogers. Those that use "we" have an
"inclusive" tone, suggesting less distance between management
and employee.</p>
<p>For instance, Mellon Bank's mission statement uses phrases
such as "Your personal conduct should reflect the highest
professional standards." Dana Corp., meanwhile, leans toward
phrases such as "We believe people respond to recognition."</p>
<p>Companies that sidestep the pronoun problem can sound
"institutional," Ms. Rogers says. Honeywell's "Principles,"
for example, is a series of phrases such as "Honeywell
believes . . . ."</p>
<p>Honeywell noticed the same thing. Two months ago, it
introduced a document heavy on the we words. That, says a
spokesman, was "very deliberate . . . to make the reader feel
that she or he is part of what is going on."</p>
<p>Of course, it's hard to know whether companies partial to
"we" are more democratic or just have a way with words. Even
Dana abruptly dropped the "we" for a sensitive subject: "It
is highly desirable to outsource a portion of our production
needs."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>ADVANCED Technology Laboratories in Bothell, Wash., gave
each of 1,600 employees a thermal mug, reducing
disposable-cup trash 65%. But the company sent a sample to a
reporter in a foot-high box filled with plastic foam pods. .
. . The good news, says consultant Towers Perrin: With the
demise of Section 89, a law that would have equalized
benefits, employers can develop "executive-only health plans"
free to top brass. The bad news? "These plans are
philosophically difficult to justify" when the rank-and-file
are shouldering more costs.</p>
