	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
its ratings on debt of two of the nation's biggest banks,
Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, and Wells Fargo & Co.,
San Francisco, because of worries about real estate and
leveraged buy-outs.
   The rating concern downgraded five Security Pacific debt
issues or securities, including its rating on the company's
senior debt to single-A-1 from double-A-3. In all, $7.4
billion in Security Pacific's parent-company securities and
debt issues are affected. Moody's also reduced its ratings on
certain debt of several Security Pacific subsidiaries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's downgraded $3.2 billion in Wells Fargo debt and
securities, among them senior debt, which went to single-A-1
from double-A-3. Moody's also lowered its rating on some debt
of Wells Fargo subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Moody's, citing softening in the California real estate
market, said both Security Pacific and Wells Fargo may have
to boost reserves for real estate losses. And it said both
companies may be exposed to losses from lending on leveraged
buy-outs; several buy-outs have fallen apart lately, because
their debt loads proved too high. In a leveraged buy-out, a
small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt
that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired
company.</p>
<p>Officials of Security Pacific and Wells Fargo couldn't be
reached to comment on the Moody's actions.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Security Pacific shares closed at $40.375, down 75 cents, and
Wells Fargo shares closed at $81.625, off $2.375.</p>
<p>Robert Smith, president and chief executive officer of
Security Pacific, said the banking concern "strongly
disagrees" with Moody's lowering of its debt. "We have
maintained a well-balanced loan portfolio consistent with
demands of the marketplace, and with adequate and appropriate
levels of reserves." Wells Fargo couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
