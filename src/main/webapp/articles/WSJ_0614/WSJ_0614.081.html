	<p class="article-leader">CAR LOANS get shorter, as lenders seek better credit
quality.
   Average length of a new bank car loan dropped to 51 months
in 1989, down from 53 months the previous two years, says the
Consumer Bankers Association. Having found that 60-, 66- or
72-month loans often leave people owing more than their cars
are worth, lenders have been pushing shorter loans. "There
has been some increase in repossessions and delinquencies,"
says Fritz Elmendorf of the CBA, who calls the trend "a
conservative reaction to controlling possible problems."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Loan length was "getting out of hand," says John Andrews
of General Motors Acceptance Corp., noting that the longer
loans were also keeping buyers out of the market for up to
six years. Sixty-month loans still dominate the market, he
says, but percentages are falling -- from 70% of all GMAC
loans in 1988 to 59% last year. "That is a tremendous drop in
one year," he says.</p>
<p>Many lenders aggressively market leasing as car loan
interest deductibility phases out, says Jack Shipman of
Liberty National Bank, Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p>FATHERS DAY GIZMOS range from the practical to the
extravagant.</p>
<p>The Sharper Image in Pittsburgh says its hot seller this
Father's Day is a $40 mirror that attaches to the shower
head, allowing water to circulate behind the mirror to
prevent fogging. Also in demand: the $35 motorized tie rack,
which the store says is selling "like popcorn." Hammacher
Schlemmer in New York says it can't stock enough $115 Swiss
Army sunglasses, which feature a "unique torsion system" that
grips the head instead of the nose. But it has sold only two
of its $59,000 reproductions of a 1929 mahogany speedboat.</p>
<p>Stress-reliever gifts are big sellers at Broadway, a Los
Angeles chain. Priced at $20, tear-apart dolls -- a baseball
umpire, football referee or golfer whose arms, legs and head
attach with Velcro -- allow Dad to vent his frustration while
watching Sunday sports. Another sports-viewing accessory: a
beer mug with a bell that can be rung for a refill. One
popular gift from Herrington Co., a Londonderry, N.H.,
catalog company: a $22.95 car wash/polish called Klasse that
replaces eight car-care compounds.</p>
<p>OLD BATTERIES attract growing attention as an
environmental problem.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep lead-acid batteries out of landfills
and incinerators, some 22 states have passed laws to
encourage recycling, says the Battery Council International.
Legislation is pending in five more states and at the federal
level. Some of the laws merely require retailers to take back
used batteries; others establish a deposit system. Currently
more than 80% of lead-acid batteries are recycled, says
Robert Garino of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries,
Washington.</p>
<p>But household batteries -- which contain mercury or
cadmium -- are only just beginning to be recycled, says
William Brown of Waste Management Inc. David Cohen of Mercury
Refining Co., Latham, N.Y., says his company is signing "a
tremendous number" of contracts to begin accepting household
batteries. "It is a relatively small part of our business
now, but it could become a very large segment."</p>
<p>Button-size batteries are the most profitable to recycle;
nickel-cadmium rechargeables are break-even, he says.</p>
<p>UPSIDE-DOWN LABELS will appear on beer bottles shipped
from Dock Street Brewing Co., Philadelphia, this month to
protest import duties on American beer. Noting that U.S.
duties are only 13.5 cents per case, it says foreign duties
range from 24 cents a case in Canada to $14.64 a case in
China.</p>
<p>FAX HUMOR gets a boost from cartoonist John Caldwell, who
offers 200 illustrated cover sheets in his "Fax This Book."
All are faxable and perforated for easy removal. One example:
"My report follows" shows a man being followed by six pages.</p>
<p>WILD BULBS exported by Dutch flower bulb companies will
bear a special label starting in July, due to an agreement
with environmental groups. The goal: to help protect
endangered species, such as snow drop, that come from Turkey.</p>
<p>THE MILKMAN makes a modest comeback as consumers opt for
convenience.</p>
<p>Welsh Farms Inc., Long Valley, N.J., says home delivery
now makes up about 25% of business "and it seems to be
growing." The largest customer group: families with children.
Roger Haadsma of Quality Creamery in Grand Rapids, Mich., is
seeing 5% annual growth in home delivery. He credits use of
returnable bottles and growing environmental awareness. So
does Marie Oberweis of Oberweis Dairy Inc., Aurora, Ill. "On
Earth Day, I personally signed up 12 new customers, but we've
been getting three to five calls every day," she says.</p>
<p>Today's milkman isn't the bottle dropper of yesteryear,
but an entrepreneur. H.B. Hood in Boston sold its home
delivery routes to individual operators more than 10 years
ago. Madison Whitehead of Welsh Farms describes the milkmen
who work with his dairy as independent business people with
expensive equipment who service up to 200 homes a day and
make "a fair living."</p>
<p>Still, less than 1% of milk sales are through milkmen,
says Christine Meissner of the American Dairy Association and
Dairy Council.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream introduces the flavor
Gorbachocolate, available only in Moscow. . . . The three
most forested states in the U.S.: Maine, New Hampshire and
West Virginia, says a new report from the USDA Forest
Service.</p>
