	<p class="article-leader">Petroleum futures prices fell sharply and then rebounded
in a roller-coaster oil market.
   Oil-supply reports figured prominently in the volatile
trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Petroleum futures were generally higher by the end of the
trading day. But a bearish weekly report from the American
Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday after trading had
closed, cut short the sizzling rally that had sent gasoline
and crude oil futures surging. The report showed U.S.
inventories of crude oil climbed nearly 1.3 million barrels
last week while those for gasoline rose 500,000 barrels
instead of declining as had been anticipated.</p>
<p>As a result of the statistics, futures prices of both
crude oil and gasoline were driven down at the opening of
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. The
July gasoline contract quickly lost about half its
day-earlier surge of 2.62 cents a gallon, and July crude
promptly dropped 34 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>But then, after prices had steadied at the lower level,
rumors began circulating late in the day that output by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is dropping
faster than had been anticipated. One report had production
down 700,000 barrels a day to 22.9 million barrels daily for
the first half of June.</p>
<p>That helped revive petroleum futures prices in both the
U.S. and Europe. Feverish buying in the last two hours of
trading on London's International Petroleum Exchange reversed
a slide in the Brent blend crude. The July contract closed
slightly higher.</p>
<p>The turnabout was even more pronounced on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. July crude rebounded from a low of
$17.17 a barrel to settle at $17.58, up seven cents for the
day. July gasoline closed 0.35 cent a gallon higher to settle
at 58.85 cents.</p>
<p>Some oil analysts were skeptical that OPEC production for
the first half of the month could yet be estimated
accurately. Still, various monitors of OPEC production are
estimating that production is declining further in June after
the slight drop in May.</p>
<p>"We are getting figures around 23.3 million {barrels a
day}, slightly lower than the 23.5 million for May," said
Antonio M. Szabo, president of Bonner & Moore Management
Science, Houston. However, he cited the cuts being made in
pricing formulas for July crude sales by several OPEC members
as more than offsetting the production decline so far as oil
markets are concerned. "The main issue in OPEC is no longer
volume, it's price," he said.</p>
<p>In a separate development concerning oil markets, the
London-based International Petroleum Exchange, or IPE, and
the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or Simex,
agreed to cooperate on development of their individual sour
(high sulfur) crude oil futures contracts. The exchanges
jointly announced that their specifications of the contract
for Dubai, the Middle East benchmark for the sour crudes,
will be identical.</p>
<p>Contracts based on the Dubai crude will begin trading on
the Simex next Thursday and on the IPE July 19.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices declined, with gold and
silver dropping to new life-of-contract lows. August-delivery
gold ended with a loss of $4 an ounce at $355.10 after
trading at a new low of $353.90. July silver traded to a new
low of $4.930 an ounce before barely recovering to end at
$4.933, down 10.7 cents. July platinum was off $8.20 an ounce
to $481.20. Selling of gold bullion in Hong Kong by Japanese
investors was the principal weakening factor, according to
one analyst. He noted that a decline in May U.S. retail
sales, particularly in durable goods, as well as a drop in
early June U.S. auto sales were also depressants because they
tended to indicate a recessionary rather than an inflationary
trend, which would create demand for precious metals as a
hedge. The dollar was down against foreign currencies, but it
had no discernible impact on precious metals, he said. Gold
may get very little support from investors during the coming
months, the analyst said, because demand for bullion usually
slackens in both Europe and the Far East during the summer
vacation period.</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn futures contracts
slumped amid profit-taking by traders. Most analysts had
expected prices to rise yesterday in the wake of the
Agriculture Department's decision after the close of trading
Tuesday to raise by 50 million bushels its estimate of U.S.
corn exports through the fall. But the rally Tuesday of
several corn futures contracts to life-of-contract high
prices apparently set the stage for the wave of
profit-taking. Prices of most wheat and soybean futures
contracts also slipped slightly on a lack of news directly
involving U.S. markets. The Soviet Union was rumored to have
purchased as much as 500,000 metric tons of South American
soybean meal and as much as one million metric tons of wheat
from Western Europe.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices fell back from Tuesday's rally on
selling prompted by weak economic reports. The July delivery
dropped one cent a pound to $1.0960. U.S. retail sales
decreased 0.7% in May, the Commerce Department reported.
April's retail sales were also revised downward to show a
drop of 0.9% from 0.6% earlier. The May decline was greater
than economists had expected. Sales of durable goods in May
fell 1.1% after dropping 1.7% in April. Auto sales in May
decreased 0.6% after falling 1.6% in April, the Commerce
Department said. Domestic auto sales are estimated to have
reached a 6.3 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate in
early June, Dow Jones News Service reported. Industry
analysts had generally expected an annual rate of about 6.6
million units in the June 1-10 period, the report said. The
Commerce Department yesterday said that U.S. privately owned
housing units completed during April were down 5.9% from
March and down 16.3% from a year earlier. The number of units
under construction at the end of April were down 0.6% from
the previous month, the department said. Durable goods
generally, and the automobile and housing industries in
particular, are significant users of copper and any weakness
in them portends a decreased consumption of copper.</p>
