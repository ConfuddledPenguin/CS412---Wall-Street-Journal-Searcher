	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- With mini-malls popping up across
America, it was inevitable one would sprout on the toniest
corner in the nation.
   But Two Rodeo Drive, now being completed at Rodeo Drive
and Wilshire Boulevard, is about as close to those
traditional courtyard malls as celebrity-hangout Spago is to
a pizza joint. No T-shirt stores or card shops here. When
opened this September, the $200 million complex will be a
veritable one-stop-shop for the Rolls-Royce set: Tiffany.
Cartier. Christian Dior.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The project consists of a half dozen stores right on Rodeo
Drive, plus a curved, shop-lined cobblestone street that
slopes up and away from Rodeo. Developer Douglas Stitzel
calls the project a "shopping district" -- not a mall -- and
boldly compares it to famous boulevards of conspicuous
consumption, such as Rome's Via Condotti.</p>
<p>With its prime location and expensive materials, Two Rodeo
is one of the costliest retail projects ever built. The price
tag is more than $1,500 per square foot of retail space, four
times that of the fanciest shopping centers. Most observers
believe the mall has a decent chance of succeeding, but only
because of clever planning, hefty cash outlays, political
maneuvering and a fair share of compromises.</p>
<p>Rents will be among the highest on Rodeo Drive: $75 to
$225 a square foot annually. But to lure top-name tenants,
Mr. Stitzel has had to give lump-sum concessions of up to
$200 a square foot, when many nearby landlords are offering
concessions of $35 a foot or less. The concessions take the
form of "tenant improvement allowances," which must be used
for store improvements and decorating. For some larger stores
at Two Rodeo, the payments could total $1 million.</p>
<p>To win city approvals, Mr. Stitzel had to design the mall
so it made economic sense but didn't exceed the city's strict
height limits or offend the sensibilities of Beverly Hills'
planners. That the project ever got built is something of a
surprise, since the city had rejected several other
developers with plans for the former parking lot.</p>
<p>It all seems to be paying off for Mr. Stitzel now. Last
month, units of Kowa Real Estate Investment Co., a Japanese
office developer, and Sogo Co., a Japanese department store
chain, agreed to buy up to a 90% stake in Two Rodeo for "well
in excess" of $200 million. Mr. Stitzel will retain the
minority interest.</p>
<p>Shopper traffic remains the big if. To try to avoid the
same fate as Rodeo Drive's only other mall, Rodeo Collection,
which has suffered from high tenant turnover, Mr. Stitzel is
using some fancy architectural devices to disguise Two
Rodeo's mall-like qualities. The project isn't covered, and
it doesn't have the monolithic facades common to most malls.
Rather, each shop is designed to look like its own building,
as if the whole area had grown store by store over time.</p>
<p>The result is a melding of limestone, terra cotta and
brick facades with arches and colonnades, topped by
copper-colored roofs. The effect is like an elaborate movie
set of a late 19th-century European street scene -- fitting
for Rodeo Drive, which rivals Disneyland for tourist traffic
in Southern California.</p>
<p>To draw customers into the mall, Mr. Stitzel built the
cobblestone pedestrian path through the center, intersecting
Rodeo Drive at each end of the project. Called Via Rodeo, the
path is an engineering solution to an economic problem: Since
ground floor shops get more business and rent for 10 times as
much as upper-level locations, Mr. Stitzel needed to create
the largest number of ground floor storefronts possible on
this small parcel.</p>
<p>Via Rodeo slopes upward toward Wilshire Boulevard,
bringing the ground up to what is actually a second-floor
level, behind the stores that front Rodeo Drive. This
configuration creates 90,000 square feet of "ground floor"
selling space, enough for each store, on a site that's only
53,000 square feet. The remaining selling space in the
126,000-square-foot project is allocated for upper- or
lower-levels in the individual stores.</p>
<p>Cobblestone notwithstanding, tenants along Via Rodeo could
have a tough time attracting shoppers, analysts caution. "The
question is whether you can get people to walk down that
inside street," says Stanley McElroy, an associate vice
president of Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate. "What's
really going to be important is how it's tenanted, who's at
the end of that street."</p>
<p>Tiffany & Co. has the prime space in the project,
19,000-square feet right at the corner of Rodeo and Wilshire.
The store had been looking to expand from its current
location in the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel directly across
the street. Mr. Stitzel's longtime friend, Regent
International Chairman Robert Burns, agreed to let him court
Tiffany, even though the lease at the hotel didn't expire
until 1994.</p>
<p>Mr. Stitzel won Tiffany in part because of the concessions
made, such as footing the bill to create a facade that
resembles the flagship on Fifth Avenue. Mr. Stitzel even
managed to get a quick plug for Tiffany's new location and
his project in the hit movie "Pretty Woman."</p>
<p>Other retailers have since agreed to open in Two Rodeo,
including Cole-Haan Footwear, Charles Jourdan, and Gianfranco
Ferre. Stringfellow's, the London restaurant and nightclub,
is also joining in. Mr. Stitzel says the project is now about
70% rented, a respectable level, with leases ranging from 10
to 15 years.</p>
<p>"The retail market is very soft right now. But on Rodeo
Drive it's very tough to find a location, so this project
should move forward well," says Tam Antebi, retail leasing
specialist with Grubb & Ellis Co. in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>More than location, the tenant improvement allowances Mr.
Stitzel gave are what lured the retailers, some people say.
"He bought them," says Gilbert Dembo, president of a Beverly
Hills commercial real estate business. "If somebody's
offering you a million dollars, you'll move. A million
dollars will buy you a lot of wallpaper."</p>
<p>Mr. Stitzel, a relatively unknown San Francisco developer,
was up against some heavyweights who wanted to build at the
exclusive address, which was owned by American Savings & Loan
Association. Bidders included investor Marvin Davis,
developer Donald Trump, former thrift executive Thomas
Spiegel, and Four Seasons Hotel Corp. Mr. Stitzel finally
bought the land for $47.6 million in 1987, after the first
winning bidder, a Columbia Savings & Loan-backed group,
couldn't get city approval for its proposed office building.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Stitzel owned the property, he made certain Two
Rodeo fit the city's height limits so he wouldn't need to ask
for a variance. He agreed to install granite sidewalks and
planters, in line with a city beautification plan. When he
wanted a new crosswalk between Two Rodeo and the Regent
Beverly Wilshire, he and the hotel agreed to pay for it
themselves. To get city approval for a larger-than-allowed
underground lot, Mr. Stitzel will provide two hours free
valet parking for people shopping anywhere on Rodeo. It's not
totally altruistic: Once parked, visitors emerge smack-dab in
the middle of Two Rodeo.</p>
<p>The brand-spanking-newness of Mr. Stitzel's project
offends some blue bloods on the swanky strip. "I've heard a
couple people look at it and go, `Um, who knows?'" says Joan
Luther, a spokeswoman for Rodeo's merchants association. Yet
most merchants welcome the project, believing it will bring
them spillover business. "It's going to be especially good
for Fred Hayman," says Mr. Hayman himself, whose boutique is
located across Rodeo from the project. "People don't just go
to one development. They come to stroll Rodeo Drive."</p>
