	<p class="article-leader">EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands -- Dutch manufacturer N.V.
Philips Gloeilampenfabriek and Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co. of Japan have agreed to form a joint venture to develop
the standard for the "domestic digital bus," or D2B, a device
that would make compatible audio and visual parts
manufactured under different specifications.
   For the D2B system to work, one of its integral parts is a
computer chip that must be designed to certain standards,
according to a Philips spokesman. The spokesman noted that at
this time only Philips and Matsushita are actively involved
in trying to set that standard.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Philips will hold a 75% stake and Matsushita a 25% stake
in the venture, D2B Systems Co., which will be based in
London and be initially funded with #3 million ($5.1
million). The Philips spokesman said that the proportions of
the stakes in the joint venture don't necessarily reflect the
amount of work accomplished by either firm in developing the
D2B standard.</p>
<p>Both Thomson S.A. of France and Sony Corp. of Japan,
neither of which are working on a D2B standard, have
recognized the need for a single standard and have agreed to
support the standard developed by Philips and Matsushita, the
Philips spokesman said.</p>
