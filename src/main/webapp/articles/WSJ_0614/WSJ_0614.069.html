	<p class="article-leader">Elsevier N.V. said it intends to sell its 33% stake in a
rival Dutch publisher, Wolters Kluwer N.V.
   Based on the current market price, Elsevier's 17.8 million
nonvoting certificates, representing Wolters Kluwer shares
held by a trust, are valued at a total of 926 million
guilders ($485 million). Elsevier's finance director,
Cornelis Alberti, said the proceeds would be used for
acquisitions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Alberti said that the sale, subject to "satisfactory
market conditions," is likely to take place in September and
that Elsevier hopes to sell the certificates at a price near
the stock market level. Elsevier named Swiss Bank Corp. as
the lead manager for the offering, which is expected to be
aimed at a wide international distribution of the
certificates.</p>
<p>The Elsevier stake stems from a hostile takeover bid the
company made for Kluwer BV in 1987. Kluwer responded by
rushing into a defensive merger with Wolters Samsom Groep
N.V. to form the current Wolters Kluwer. Elsevier's
consolation prize was a 33% stake in Wolters Kluwer, for
which it paid about 575 million guilders.</p>
<p>Since then, Elsevier has pursued close cooperation or a
merger with Wolters Kluwer, but the latter company has
repeatedly rebuffed the advances. Because the certificates
carry no voting rights, Elsevier's stake gave it very little
influence. Nor were the financial rewards high: Elsevier
collected about 19 million guilders of dividend income from
Wolters Kluwer last year, producing a return of about 2% on
the market value of the investment.</p>
<p>Elsevier's Mr. Alberti said his company decided to sell
because of that low return and because it had failed to bring
about cooperation. But he said Elsevier remains interested in
closer ties with Wolters Kluwer, and even in the possibility
of an eventual merger. Once Elsevier no longer carries the
"big stick" of a 33% stake, he suggested, Wolters Kluwer
might be more inclined to discuss cooperation.</p>
<p>Wolters Kluwer's chairman, Mijndert Ververs, hasn't ruled
out the possibility of joint ventures with Elsevier, but he
said yesterday that he was pleased with Elsevier's decision
to sell its stake.</p>
<p>Elsevier, which had 1989 sales of 1.96 billion guilders,
specializes in scientific, professional and trade
publications and owns several Dutch newspapers. Wolters
Kluwer, whose 1989 sales totaled 1.88 billion guilders, is a
specialist in legal and tax publications.</p>
