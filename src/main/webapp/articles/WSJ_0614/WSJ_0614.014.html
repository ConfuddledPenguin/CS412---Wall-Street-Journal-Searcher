	<p class="article-leader">"Dick Tracy," the movie, is a gorgeous piece of pop art,
part comic book, part real. Production designer Richard
Sylbert and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro have created a
world of neon and shadow that's both darkly elegant and
gaudy. Rooftops are blue, streets are green.
   But after a while the movie started to wear on me, like a
conversation with an artfully dressed and stunning man whose
looks are far more interesting than anything he has to say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The problem lies in the stated intention of the people
behind the movie, whose odd ambition -- which they accomplish
-- was to re-create the Chester Gould comic-strip characters
as humans but without adding a third, or human, dimension to
them. This sticks the picture with a rather humorless,
square-jawed Good Guy vs. Bad Guy approach that seems
out-of-sync with its playful design. There's none of the
campy action of the original Superman movie, and none of the
brooding psychological overtones of last summer's cartoon
hit, "Batman."</p>
<p>It doesn't help that Warren Beatty, the director and star,
has chosen to play Tracy as a dull, sweet-natured man who
seems a remarkably vague presence in a film called "Dick
Tracy." Indeed the only nuance of his character is something
he wears -- a bright yellow fedora and matching trenchcoat.</p>
<p>For those of you who have limited yourselves to comic-free
papers like this one or the New York Times, Dick Tracy has
been a syndicated feature for almost 60 years. Dick Tracy was
and is a no-nonsense police detective who fights an
assortment of criminals with generally old-fashioned methods
(unimpressive guns, fists). He's a down-to-earth hero, with
no troubling alien identity like Superman, no revenge
fantasies like Batman.</p>
<p>Though his radio wristwatch was innovative 40 years ago,
Dick Tracy is a low-tech kind of hero.</p>
<p>Mr. Beatty has been quoted as saying he wanted to make
"Dick Tracy" because he "wanted to be seven years old again."
Yet he is many decades past age seven and has acquired great
sophistication and experience over the years, which may
explain the sharp disparity between the movie's style and its
content. The child in Mr. Beatty apparently was content with
simplistic story and characterization; the adult in him knew
he'd better wrap it all up in something dazzling.</p>
<p>Most of the flamboyant touches have gone into lighting and
costumes and prosthetics (though none for Mr. Beatty, whose
pretty chin doesn't resemble Dick Tracy's boxy jaw at all).
The Dick Tracy bad guys -- Pruneface, Flat Top, The Brow and
Lips -- are played by humans done up to look like comic-book
grotesques. Much technical care and enough plastic to create
a minor eco-panic have gone into their physical design. Yet
these masks don't hide the lack of characterization. Even
Dustin Hoffman's Mumbles -- the inarticulate mobster --
doesn't really register.</p>
<p>One might think the material was an impossible limitation
if it weren't for Al Pacino's Big Boy Caprice. Big Boy speaks
lines worth repeating, and Mr. Pacino's sly delivery makes
them easy to remember. Though Mr. Pacino, too, has been
disguised with a hooked nose and body padding and garish
clothing, Big Boy isn't just another amusing costume. Yes,
he's evil, Dick Tracy's arch rival. But he isn't a ruthless
psychopath like Batman's Joker. He's deliriously eccentric, a
gangster as obssessed with making the showgirls at his new
nightclub dance in sync as he is with ruling the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Pacino gives an exuberant comic performance as this
neurotic megalomaniac who casually compares himself to
Napoleon and Washington. He freely misquotes politicians and
philosophers: "If you aren't for the people, you can't buy
the people," he explains to his fellow gangsters. It is
difficult not to fall in love with a character who blithely
says, "The way I see it, and Plato agrees with me . . ."</p>
<p>The fights between Dick Tracy and Big Boy are staged as a
series of interruptions to Tracy's attempts to propose
marriage to Tess Trueheart. The talented Glenne Headley does
what she can to liven up Tess's unrelenting niceness.
Inevitably Tess and Tracy sit down at a diner for some apple
pie, they eat, and just as the talk starts to turn to their
relationship his radio wristwatch calls him off to another
emergency, somewhere in the city.</p>
<p>Gangsters battle each other and Tracy on these stylized
city streets, while a nightclub singer named Breathless
Mahoney keeps on singing at the Club Ritz. As everyone must
know from the hype that has preceded this movie, the
superstar Madonna plays Breathless, and in doing so does a
credible job with the bittersweet songs Stephen Sondheim
wrote for the movie.</p>
<p>Though the Breathless of the comic strip was purely
villainous, the film makers have put a romantic edge on her
obsession with Tracy. Madonna looks swell in the satiny
dresses clinging to her well-honed body and with her cloud of
platinum hair. She's best at expressing cold disgust, as when
she tells her first patron, the gangster Lips, as he noisily
slurps clams: "Do you mind if I leave? I get sick watching
you eat."</p>
<p>She's less convincing with the vulnerability the film's
creators have forced onto her character. There is nothing
vulnerable about Madonna. However, her sexual pursuit of
Tracy does give Mr. Beatty an opportunity to act a bit.
Despite his much publicized romance with Madonna, his Tracy
seems impervious to her Breathlessness. When she forces him
to kiss her he looks like a man who's never been kissed and
isn't much interested in starting now.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Beatty's Tracy seems a little removed from all
the other players, even from the aggressively cute
freckle-faced Kid (Charlie Korsmo) who becomes his protege.
The director and star looks sheepish, as though somewhere
along the way it's hit him that being 53-going-on-seven isn't
as much fun as he thought it would be.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>VIDEO TIP: Much of the contemporary movie-going audience
must be a little baffled by the middle-aged media's
fascination with Warren Beatty. Both his sexual pursuits and
his films belong to an era that has passed. However, that
boyish grin and naive pose once had enormous appeal,
especially at the beginning, with "Splendor in the Grass," in
1961, and later with "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Heaven Can
Wait." In 1981 he made the grandiose "Reds," and apparently
liked the epic form so much he allowed Elaine May to impose
it on the sweet little road picture that "Ishtar" should have
been.</p>
