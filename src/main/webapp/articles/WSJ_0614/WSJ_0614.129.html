	<p class="article-leader">California's top insurance regulator ruled that insurers
must roll back certain rates 20% unless they can show that
doing so would deprive them of making an 11.2% return on
equity.
   The move provides a glimmer of hope to supporters of
consumer activists' flagging campaign to change the way the
insurance industry operates in California.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move prompted immediate howls from insurers, who vowed
to attack the ruling in court. It comes after months of often
acrimonious hearings and debates on how to implement
California's Proposition 103, a ballot initiative passed by
voters in November 1988 that mandated sharp cutbacks in auto
insurance rates and called for a welter of new regulatory
limits on insurance companies.</p>
<p>The ruling, by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani
Gillespie, set a minimum return on equity that was well below
levels lobbied for by insurance companies. And it ran counter
to the findings of William Fernandez, an administrative law
judge who ruled in May that insurers should be exempted from
the rollback if it meant they couldn't make a 13.2% return.
Many supporters of the proposition had feared that that
ruling might doom Proposition 103, particularly its provision
for rate relief.</p>
<p>Ms. Gillespie called her ruling "pro-consumer." She added:
"Whether consumers receive the full 20% rollbacks promised by
the drafters of Proposition 103 remains to be seen, but I am
ordering rollbacks to the maximum extent permissible under
the proposition."</p>
<p>Indeed, yesterday's ruling was seen by all sides as merely
a small step down what's still a very long road. Ms.
Gillespie said she expects to have to litigate to enforce the
new system.</p>
<p>David Balabanian, a San Francisco attorney representing
Fireman's Fund Corp., said Ms. Gillespie had the right idea.
"There will be suits," he said, "and the process will drag
on." Added Harvey Rosenfield, a consumer activist and prime
mover behind Proposition 103: "This is a modest move in the
right direction, but we've been inching along for 18 months
and we're still a long way from implementing anything."</p>
<p>The ruling actually does little to clarify the murkiness
that has enveloped Proposition 103 since its passage. Some
big insurers, including State Farm Insurance Cos., which
controls about 18% of the California auto insurance market,
make far less than an 11.2% return and theoretically could
raise rates under Ms. Gillespie's ruling. And smaller
insurers that offer some of the cheaper policies do make
returns above the 11.2% mark by operating efficiently; they
might be forced out of the market by the rollback.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Rosenfield and other supporters of the
proposition, while dissatisfied with some aspects of the
commissioner's ruling, saw it as progress. The insurance
industry has won a string of legal victories since the
measure passed that seemed to put insurers on the verge of
crippling the reform effort.</p>
<p>A day before Mr. Fernandez's ruling last month, a Los
Angeles judge invalidated regulations attempting to limit the
ability of insurance companies to use place of residence when
computing auto insurance rates. Such "territorial pricing" is
a hot issue in California, where urban motorists may have to
pay several times the rates for suburban and rural drivers.</p>
<p>The exercise of figuring out an appropriate rate of return
for insurance companies was made necessary by a state Supreme
Court ruling last year that watered down some Proposition 103
provisions and held that the measure couldn't be implemented
in a way that deprived insurers of a "fair rate of return."
However, it left it to Ms. Gillespie to define that.</p>
<p>Insurance industry lawyers said it was unusual for a
regulator to ignore the findings of an administrative law
judge, and noted that Ms. Gillespie has had trouble in the
past when her department went against administrative law
findings in other Proposition 103 matters.</p>
