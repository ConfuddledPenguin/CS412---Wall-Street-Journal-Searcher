	<p class="article-leader">Tate & Lyle PLC said it remains confident it will be
allowed eventually to bid for Berisford International PLC,
despite the British government's ordering an investigation of
the competitive effect of the two sugar concerns' combining.
   The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday ordered a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, to be completed
Sept. 28. A 1987 bid by Tate & Lyle for Berisford was blocked
on competitive grounds. Merging the two producers would leave
Tate & Lyle in control of 95% of Britain's sugar supplies.
Berisford officials weren't available to comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tate & Lyle hasn't indicated what price it is willing to
pay for Berisford, a financially troubled conglomerate that
also has financial services and property operations. In the
year ended Sept. 30, Berisford had a net loss attributable to
shareholders of #24.6 million ($41.9 million), reversing
year-earlier profit of #33.2 million; pretax profit rose 5.7%
to #107.3 million. Tate & Lyle reiterated that terms of any
offer will depend on the value and financial standing of
Berisford's non-sugar interests.</p>
