	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc., a big
gold producer, said it plans to continue its previously
announced 229.5 million Canadian dollar (US$195.7 million)
offer to acquire Stikine Resources Ltd., half-owner of the
promising Eskay Creek gold project.
   The announcement, which followed last week's disclosure by
Placer Dome that it might withdraw its bid, sparked a sharp
jump in Stikine's share price on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Stikine shares closed yesterday at C$67.375, up C$3.875, on
volume of 186,009 shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Placer Dome disclosed late yesterday that it
acquired 40,600 additional Stikine shares in open-market
purchases on the Toronto exchange, raising Placer Dome's
stake in the company to 5.2%, from 4.7%. A spokesman wouldn't
say whether Placer Dome intends to make further open-market
purchases before its bid expires Tuesday.</p>
<p>The share price of Stikine, a Vancouver-based gold
exploration company, had slumped after Placer Dome said it
might cancel its C$67.50-a-share offer, in view of a lock-up
agreement under which Stikine's 42% owners agreed to tender
their stock to a rival bidder, Corona Corp., a Toronto-based
gold producer.</p>
<p>"The market has recognized that the Placer Dome offer is
superior to the Corona proposal," Anthony Petrina, Placer
Dome's president and chief executive officer, said. By
threatening to withdraw its bid, "They {Placer Dome} were
able to highlight the difference between their offer and
Corona's offer," said Barry Allan, gold analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd., Toronto.</p>
<p>Corona has offered to swap 6.5 Corona Class A shares, plus
two shares of a newly created unit, Corona Gold Corp., for
each Stikine share. Stikine holders also would be eligible
subsequently to receive a special Corona Gold stock dividend.</p>
<p>Analysts have had difficulty valuing Corona's offer, which
is part of a broad corporate reorganization plan by Corona.
But Mr. Allan said the lock-up pact, which calls for the
exchange of 8.5 Corona Class A shares for each Stikine share,
under certain conditions, established a "down-side" benchmark
for Corona's offer.</p>
<p>Based on the C$7.375 closing price of Corona Class A
shares yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the
"downside" value of Corona's offer is about C$62.69 a Stikine
share.</p>
<p>Corona already owns an interest in Eskay Creek through
45%-owned Prime Resources Group Inc., a Vancouver-based gold
exploration company. Prime owns 50% of Eskay Creek and
operates the gold project, which is in northwestern British
Columbia.</p>
