	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Just 17 days after taking office last year,
George Bush unveiled a plan to repair the savings-and-loan
industry so that, in his words, "the country won't have to
face this problem again."
   Today, the Bush administration is taking a new look at the
savings-and-loan fiasco, and is finding it bigger and more
vexatious than ever. Some advisers fear the mess, which the
president tried to pass off last year as an "inherited"
problem, threatens to envelop the Bush presidency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The financial calamity is undercutting Mr. Bush's
optimistic assertion just four months ago in his State of the
Union address that the federal deficit is on a downward path.
It is pushing him toward surrendering his politically potent
pledge of "no new taxes." And by diverting money, public
attention and time of top aides, it may devour his domestic
agenda.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's aides are beginning to fear that "S&L hell"
could hurt his 1992 re-election bid. "Everyone is worried
about it because it is so large," says Robert Teeter, Mr.
Bush's pollster. One Democrat, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
is calling Mr. Bush "the savings-and-loan president."
Recurrent headlines about the president's son, Neil, a former
director of a failed Colorado thrift who has been accused of
conflicts of interest by regulators, don't make the White
House rest any easier.</p>
<p>The latest occasion for all this discomfort is the
administration's admission that it badly underestimated the
cost of the thrift bailout last year. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady now says the government would have to write a
check today for as much as $130 billion -- roughly twice his
original estimate -- to make up the difference between
Americans' deposits in government-insured savings and loans
and the current value of the institutions' assets.</p>
<p>How much is $130 billion? Well, it's 30% more than the
salaries of all the schoolteachers in America. It's more than
the combined 1989 profits of the Fortune 500 largest
industrial companies -- every single one from General Motors
Corp. (No. 1) to Affiliated Publications Inc. (No. 500). It
would send 1.6 million kids through four years at Yale
University, room and board included. And that doesn't include
either the $52 billion still needed to pay for thrifts that
the government seized and unloaded before George Bush became
president or the multibillion-dollar interest tab. (Even
yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office raised its
estimate of the cost to $150 billion.)</p>
<p>The embarrassing miscalculation is provoking an orgy of
finger-pointing within the administration. "Treasury was
doing the numbers side of things," says Richard Breeden, who
was the White House point man on savings and loans until he
became chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
last fall. Others at the White House fault Mr. Breeden. "It
was Breeden's baby and he didn't share it too readily," says
one White House official.</p>
<p>A gaggle of top administration officials now insist -- off
the record, of course -- that they questioned the Treasury's
figures internally, but bowed to Treasury officials'
conviction that their estimates were sound. But Treasury
Undersecretary Robert Glauber says that isn't so. "They
certainly said we should make sure there's enough money," he
says. "I don't recall anyone saying we should go for more
money."</p>
<p>Combined with infighting within the thrift bureaucracy and
other snafus, the new estimates change the politics of the
problem, making it tough for Mr. Bush to position himself as
the president who solved the problem. "If it drags on," frets
one White House official, "the people in office at the time
will be blamed."</p>
<p>The numbers also have altered the administration's budget
strategy, propelling George Bush into a budget summit with
congressional Democrats. "One of the reasons we thought it
important to get moving on the budget," White House Budget
Director Richard Darman told a Senate committee recently,
"was the prospect of all this additional borrowing in a
relatively compressed period." The administration also hopes
to use the budget summit to get the additional money it needs
for the thrift cleanup without reopening the whole
troublesome issue.</p>
<p>With one eye on Mr. Bush's re-election and another on
minimizing the cost to taxpayers, top White House officials
are getting increasingly involved in the S&L rescue, a
mission that until recently they had left in the Treasury's
hands. "People {in the White House} have focused on the fact
that . . . there's going to be an attempt to lay this at the
president's door," one Treasury official says.</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has stepped in,
huddling with Mr. Brady by phone and in person to discuss the
thrift bailout. "Now that Sununu sees the Democrats testing
it out as a political issue, it's on his computer screen,"
says one administration official. "People are talking about
the issue in the White House: `What should we say? What kind
of spin should we put on it? How do we get Neil Bush off the
front page?'"</p>
<p>Mr. Darman and White House Counsel Boyden Gray, who
advised Mr. Bush on regulatory issues in the Reagan years,
are also devoting much more time to keeping an eye on the
Treasury.</p>
<p>Some administration officials are even beginning to wonder
whether the Treasury's original solution to the problem -- as
modified by Congress -- is making it worse rather than
better. By nationalizing sick S&Ls as quickly as possible and
then trying to sell off a mounting stockpile of assets,
officials fear they may be increasing the ultimate cost of
the bailout.</p>
<p>"One of the things we have learned," says William Seidman,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., "is that if
you put these things in a junkyard, they lose value."
Managers, even the good ones, leave. Customers flee.
Reluctant buyers grow even more wary. And the cost to the
taxpayer balloons.</p>
<p>In a far-ranging search for alternatives, the White House
and the thrift bureaucracy are even considering a politically
risky plan to use government money to prop up some sick
thrifts, in the hope that their assets will eventually
increase in value, Mr. Seidman says. A little-noted provision
in the thrift-bailout law passed last year allows such
assistance.</p>
<p>Although that option might save money in the long run, it
is fraught with risk. It bears a frightening resemblance to
the mistakes of the past. After all, one big reason the
cleanup is proving so costly is that Congress, the Reagan
administration and regulators kept insolvent thrifts alive
and growing instead of closing them.</p>
<p>"Everyone is gun shy," says a White House official. "It
would be very very difficult because the first time you made
a mistake, you'd have such a bad reaction." Mr. Seidman says
he wouldn't be talking about this if he weren't resigning.</p>
<p>But as their cost estimates balloon, administration
officials say they must think about ways to save taxpayers'
money. The government, they argue, hasn't had a good track
record as an asset manager. Senior Treasury officials say a
final decision will be made within the next two months on
whether to alter their strategy. A more modest option on the
table is to try to sell thrifts, where buyers can be found,
without tainting them first by turning them into wards of the
government. Also under consideration is creating something
akin to a mutual fund in which real-estate assets would be
privately managed -- with the government getting a share of
the profits if the assets appreciate in value.</p>
<p>When the new Bush administration presented its plan in
February 1989, it told Congress a check for $50 billion at
first and $23 billion down the road would provide more than
enough money. "There is a slight reserve in there so that if
there are any unforeseen, unpleasant circumstances that show
up, we've got some room," Mr. Brady said at the time.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors, the Bush administration
underestimated the problem. It assumed the government would
have to take over only about 500 savings-and-loans. Instead,
Mr. Brady now says, the total may be more like 1,000. Hence
the new, higher cost estimate of between $89 billion and $132
billion.</p>
<p>The independent-minded Mr. Seidman, who endorsed the
original estimate, says the thrift industry was in worse
condition than the government knew. He cites City Federal
Savings Bank, New Jersey's largest savings association, as an
example. On regulators' internal rating scale of 1 (the best)
to 5 (the worst), he says City Federal was rated a "2" by
thrift regulators when FDIC examiners arrived in 1988 to
check the books under the new law. When they left, the thrift
was insolvent and was taken over. "Right there," Mr. Seidman
says, "there's a $2 billion loss" that wasn't included in the
original estimate.</p>
<p>Private analysts say the City Federal example illustrates
how bad the Treasury's original estimate was. "It wouldn't
have been unforeseen if the regulators had been reading the
balance sheet," says Peter Treadway of Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. According to Sheshunoff Information Services
Inc., all of the "capital" on City Federal's books at the end
of 1988 was actually the sort of accounting gimmicks allowed
by regulators rather than the cold hard cash that can be used
to offset losses.</p>
