to consolidate its oil and gas partnerships with a recently

Bradmar will offer to exchange one share of its common stock
for every 10 units of the partnerships and for every five
dollars of exchange value of the partnerships' interests in
the programs. Bradmar is also offering 16,935 shares for the
general partner's interest in the limited partnerships.
   The exchange offer, which expires July 13, is subject to
the receipt of about 8.4 million of the 16.8 million
outstanding units.</p>
