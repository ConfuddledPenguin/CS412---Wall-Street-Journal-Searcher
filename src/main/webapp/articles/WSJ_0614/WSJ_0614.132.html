	<p class="article-leader">THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Amgen Inc., whose stock price has
nearly doubled over the past 12 months, declared a 2-for-1
stock split and said it would redeem its convertible
debentures.
   The biotechnology company said the split would be
distributed Aug. 10 to stock of record July 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amgen will redeem its $50 million face amount of 8%
convertible debentures July 25 at a price of $5,386.67 for
each $5,000 face amount of debentures. The conversion rate is
96.8992 shares for each $5,000 principal amount, equal to a
price of $51.60 a share.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Amgen
shares rose $1.50 to $74 a share. The stock's large premium
over the conversion price makes it more attractive for debt
holders to convert their debentures into Amgen common than to
tender the debentures to the company.</p>
<p>Assuming conversion of all of the debentures, Amgen said
it will have about 37.2 million shares outstanding after the
stock split. The conversion will save the company about $4
million in annual interest expense.</p>
