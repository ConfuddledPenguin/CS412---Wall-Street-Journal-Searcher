	<p class="article-leader">It sounds like a sure-fire way to make money. Everyone
wants property taxes reduced, and you can be the one who
makes it happen.
   In the past five years, companies have boomed by teaching
aspiring entrepreneurs the ropes of a fast-growing, little
regulated field: appealing property tax assessments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some graduates are making a good living at the work, a
legitimate service for property owners. But a rising number
of trainees, after spending thousands of dollars without
turning a profit, are complaining bitterly that they were
misled.</p>
<p>Through seminars and mail-order manuals, the firms are
churning out scores of graduates at a steady clip. Two years
ago, Deborah Gates answered a magazine ad for a course by
Lear McNally Corp. The three-day course and materials cost
$7,500, but the Philadelphia training company offered a
money-back guarantee of success. Lear's promotional material
said the work required neither experience nor licenses, and
it promised three years of "ongoing education and support. .
. ."</p>
<p>After taking the course, Mrs. Gates discovered a real
estate license is indeed required to state an opinion of land
value for a property assessment appeal in her home, Dade
County, Fla. Also, the county's appeals process varied
considerably from what Lear taught. On a part-time basis,
Mrs. Gates is trying to appeal cases. But in two years, she
won only two appeals.</p>
<p>As for the ongoing support, the company recently
disconnected its phones and is now the target of a
preliminary investigation by the U.S. postal inspector in
Philadelphia. None of Lear's principals could be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gates isn't alone. "At the most, I believe one person
out of every class has a chance of making good money," says
Richard Fogg, a former sales manager with Property Tax
Consultants Inc., San Diego, which also offers courses. (A
typical course may have 20 or more students.) "It's a tough
business," he adds.</p>
<p>Many who pay for these courses accuse the training firms
of misleading them on the income they are likely to earn, the
ease of the appeal process and the availability of clients.
Increasingly, they are filing complaints with state attorneys
general, Better Business Bureaus and U.S. postal inspectors
around the country. Pennsylvania's attorney general, for
example, received 15 complaints in the past year. Meanwhile,
local property tax review boards complain of frivolous
appeals -- stemming from some seminar graduates -- that bog
down the appeals process.</p>
<p>The companies offering the courses deny any wrongdoing and
point to many successful graduates.</p>
<p>The complaints have grown as the courses themselves have
grown, spurred by rising property taxes in recent years. "I
see a whole new service industry developing," says Bill
Barrett, president of Property Tax Reduction Consultants, a
Naperville, Ill., tax consulting firm and seminar sponsor.
"There is a demand out there."</p>
<p>Usually for a fee of up to $10,000, a typical firm offers
a two-day or five-day course to teach "affiliates" how to
challenge commercial property valuations on a contingency
basis. Success at the work usually depends on finding errors
in tax bills or discrepancies in appraisals.</p>
<p>A handful of firms lead the seminar business nationwide,
advertising mostly in entrepreneurial and business
publications. Often, a company promises from six months to
three years of free backup support, which typically includes
having questions answered by staff consultants and getting
advice from real-estate consultants. No firm interviewed
would give the total number of its graduates.</p>
<p>To be sure, tax attorneys and consultants provide a useful
service for commercial and residential property owners by
appealing tax assessments. And many graduates say there is
money to be made in the field. Kate Frechette, a Rochester,
N.Y., affiliate of Property Tax Consultants, recently got an
apartment's assessment cut to $1.8 million from $2.4 million.
Her fees range from 19% to 51% of a reduction.</p>
<p>But many affiliates complain that the courses don't cover
enough ground. "It's really not sufficient -- even after you
absorb all the material," says Jimmie Lou Jacobs, who took a
two-day course at Property Valuation Consultants Inc.,
Joliet, Ill., that sells for $9,900. A $500 computer program
bought from PVC proved no more helpful. After hundreds of
letters and calls to property owners in a year and a half,
Mrs. Jacobs says she attracted only six clients. Although she
got help from an experienced tax consultant, the local board
rejected all six assessment appeals.</p>
<p>PVC says unsatisfied affiliates aren't working hard enough
or are in the wrong markets. Says Vice President Rick
Neiswonger: "Everybody isn't going to pick up everything. We
offer to work with them and help them any way we can."</p>
<p>But PVC's promotions paint a promising picture. On a
videotape for PVC, actor Eddie Albert claims, "Actually about
50 cases a year -- just four a month -- can result in an
income a doctor or a lawyer works years to achieve." PVC
President Nancy Freeman concedes property tax consulting is
complex. "Nevertheless," she tells prospective students in a
videotape, "in just two days here in Joliet, we can make you
quite expert, and you don't have to have a background in real
estate."</p>
<p>Mr. Neiswonger notes: "A lot of it has to do with
individual talent. It takes a lot of work."</p>
<p>Yet Joseph Eckert, the International Association of
Assessing Officers' director of education, says: "Paying any
amount of money, one can never learn fee appraisal in a week
-- it's simply too short a time."</p>
<p>Mr. Eckert points out that a Certified Assessment
Evaluator, a professional ranking in the IAAO, requires at
least three 30-hour courses, demonstrations of appraisals,
exams and other courses.</p>
<p>Affiliates often find counties base assessments on factors
and cycles that differ dramatically from state to state. In
Florida, for example, properties are revalued or reviewed for
assessment every year. Elsewhere, reassessments can be as
infrequent as a decade or more. California reassesses values
upon sale of property.</p>
<p>Many affiliates complain they aren't told of all the state
and local requirements for tax appeals before they start. A
year and a half ago, real estate broker Perry Frantzman
answered an ad in this newspaper to become an affiliate of
Property Tax Consultants. But his career as a tax consultant
was as short-lived as the five-day course he took for $4,995
(it now costs $7,500). In New Jersey, he found, only a
practicing attorney can appeal corporate real-estate tax
assessments in state tax court. He says instructors never
disclosed this, despite his questions on the matter.</p>
<p>Michael McCormick, president of PTC, says he didn't talk
to Mr. Frantzman before Mr. Frantzman took the class. But he
adds: "We tell everybody they need to check out the local
requirements. It serves us no purpose to put someone into a
position where they can't do business."</p>
<p>Disgruntled affiliates aren't the only people with gripes.
In many states, tax appeal boards -- and even some tax
consulting firms -- have complained about the lack of
discretion shown by some consulting affiliates in soliciting
clients. Some send mass direct-mail solicitations, then
schedule the assessment-appeal cases before receiving solid
commitments from owners. A few months ago, one affiliate
filed 175 appeals with the DuPage County, Ill., tax
assessment office but later withdrew 150.</p>
<p>"Each one of those complaints has to be docketed and
scheduled for a hearing," said Paul Bower, DuPage County
supervisor of assessments. "Time has to be set aside, and we
don't have a lot of time." Mr. Bower said his office grants
changes in assessments in about 25% of the appeal cases, all
of which can be appealed to the Illinois Property Tax Appeal
Board.</p>
<p>The IAAO's Mr. Eckert hopes states soon will adopt
licensing laws and tougher regulations dealing with this
growing industry. Very few states -- under 10 -- require some
sort of licensing now, he says. Despite numerous appeals, he
adds: "The tax burden in the community doesn't go away. It
has to be redistributed somewhere."</p>
