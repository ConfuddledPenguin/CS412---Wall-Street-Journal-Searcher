	<p class="article-leader">Senior Bush administration officials, accusing Japan of
foot-dragging, say talks aimed at improving trade and
economic relations are stalled and that President Bush and
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu may have to meet again soon to
defuse tensions.
   The White House is sensitive about the recent erosion in
the bilateral economic relationship because President Bush
earlier this year decided against naming Japan for unfair
trade practices under the tough Super 301 provision of the
1988 Trade Act, which carries the threat of trade
retaliation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. critics charge that ever since that decision Japan
has stonewalled U.S. attempts to gain better access to its
markets. For example, a recent high-level U.S.-Japan meeting
in Hawaii resulted in little or no progress in resolving
issues that threaten to delay a final report -- due at the
end of the month -- on ways to resolve problems.</p>
<p>The two countries began this process, called the
Structural Impediments Initiative (SII), last summer in an
attempt to reduce bilateral friction and address the U.S.'s
stubbornly high bilateral deficit with Japan. "We were
shocked at the stonewalling in Hawaii," said one senior
administration official who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Japanese officials, in return, argue that the U.S. is
pushing commitments that weren't required by the interim
report. "The main architecture is already on the table," a
foreign ministry official said. "Neither side is supposed to
add new buildings to the blueprint."</p>
<p>The Japanese seem to sense that fast repair work is
needed. Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and Vice Minister for
International Finance Makoto Utsumi are in the U.S. this week
to meet with their U.S. counterparts to discuss the SII and
other bilateral issues. Shintaro Abe, a powerful,
high-ranking leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, will
soon visit the U.S. for meetings on the 30th anniversary of
the U.S.-Japan security treaty, but will also likely hold
talks on the SII.</p>
<p>Both sides agree that the most contentious issues
preventing the SII from succeeding are Japan's future level
of public spending; procedures for following up and ensuring
progress in implementing the SII report's recommendations,
and how Japan will toughen its antitrust procedures.</p>
<p>Recent statements from the Japanese government saying that
the country intends to continue running a surplus equivalent
to 2% of national output have angered the Bush
administration, particularly when the U.S. is trying to
address a $49 billion deficit with Japan. A continued
Japanese surplus of that magnitude "creates a dislocation in
the trading system," U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
said in a meeting with reporters yesterday, adding that it's
"a statement from the {Japanese} ministry of finance that
needs to be corrected."</p>
<p>Others are more direct. "We're damned if we're going to
let {Japan} accumulate another half trillion dollars in trade
surpluses at our expense over the course of the next decade,"
said the senior administration official. That, he continued,
will happen if the Japanese don't open up their markets
further and increase public investment.</p>
<p>Japan's recent insistence on retaining its surplus "is
purely a negotiating ploy on the part of the Ministry of
Finance of Japan," David Mulford, Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs, told reporters this week. He said it
was an attempt "to take pressure off itself to comply with
understandings it reached with the U.S. earlier this year to
increase public expenditure."</p>
<p>Congress also is growing impatient. "The government of
Japan must understand that if SII doesn't meaningfully
address bilateral trade concerns, the Congress may have no
choice but to explore additional measures to address these
concerns," Sens. Robert Packwood (R., Ore.), Max Baucus (D.,
Mont.) and Jack Danforth (R., Mo.), said in a joint letter
sent to Mrs. Hills this week.</p>
<p>The Japanese insist they have made progress since a
lengthy interim SII report was published in April. On May 30,
Japan revised its large retail store regulations, saying
stores must receive a permit to open within 18 months of
application. Previously, that process often dragged on for 10
years, effectively excluding many foreign stores. Also,
Japan's Fair Trade Commission has increased its staff and is
drafting antitrust changes that, the Japanese say, answer
many U.S. requests. Japan's major ministries also are mulling
further proposals for meeting U.S. concerns about the SII,
officials in Tokyo say.</p>
<p>And foreign ministry officials say that the notion Japan
should preserve its surplus is a minority position advocated
by the ministry of finance. "We are aware of that view, but
the government as a whole doesn't have that as a policy," one
Japanese official said.</p>
<p>But difficult problems remain. In particular, the U.S.
wants Japan to increase public spending to 10% of the gross
national product over the next 10 years. But the Japanese say
they want to use a yen total rather than a percentage of
national output. "They raised the 400 trillion yen figure,"
another senior U.S. administration official said, but he said
that "just continues the {Japanese} surplus at its current
level." Mr. Kaifu himself, in remarks to reporters over the
weekend, also said Japan was opposed to specifying
percentages of GNP, indicating strong resistance to the U.S.
approach.</p>
<p>There also are disagreements over what the penalties
should be for punishing those who violate antitrust
regulations; the U.S. maintains that Japan merely imposes
small fines that amount to little more than wrist-slapping.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Japan plan to exchange proposals June 20 and
then meet June 25 to finalize the SII report. But U.S.
officials question whether that will be possible. "If there's
to be a final report by the time of the Houston summit on
July 9, then we'll probably have to meet again {after the end
of June}," this official said.</p>
<p>If those SII meetings do falter, President Bush and Prime
Minister Kaifu will at least get a chance to address these
issues soon. They are scheduled to hold a private bilateral
summit before the main gathering in Houston of the heads of
state of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada.</p>
