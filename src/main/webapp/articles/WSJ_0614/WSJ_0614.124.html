	<p class="article-leader">Racal Electronics PLC said pretax profit for the year
ended March 31 rose 13% to #201 million ($342.4 million) from
#178 million a year earlier largely because of substantial
growth in its telecommunications sector.
   The company said profit after tax and minority interests
was little changed at #117 million.</p>

of its telecommunications division and listed for trading on
London's Stock Exchange in late 1988, separately reported a
95% rise in pretax profit on a 69% increase in sales.</p>
