	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Faced with slack corporate financing needs,
Chase Manhattan Corp. is considering selling assets and
paring back some activities, which could possibly include
layoffs.
   Chase bankers said that the review is still under way and
that no decisions have been reached. Two areas that are
reportedly being considered for cutbacks are foreign-exchange
trading and European corporate finance. But although pruning
is possible, Chase isn't expected to pull out of those
businesses altogether.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are clearly determined to improve profitability,"
Richard J. Boyle, vice chairman in charge of global banking,
said in an interview. "The level of deal flow is markedly
lower . . . we're not looking at something that is all that
radical. It's an ongoing process of renewal."</p>
<p>Among the assets that the bank holding company might sell
are its buildings in Europe as well as One New York Plaza,
which it has tried to sell in the past.</p>
<p>Chase's primary dealership in U.S. government securities
and its recently won securities-underwriting powers aren't on
the block, according to Chase insiders.</p>
<p>The hunt for ways to reduce overhead costs is apparently
an outgrowth of a recent retreat attended by Chase's top
managers. At that meeting, some of those present said,
President Thomas G. Labrecque outlined the prospects for
revenue growth for the remainder of the year and concluded
that expenses need to be reduced.</p>
<p>The earnings outlook is understood to be especially tight
in Mr. Boyle's global banking unit. Its North American
corporate-finance unit is trailing results posted a year ago,
people in the bank say. Last year the unit posted record
revenue, largely on the strength of corporate acquisitions
and restructurings. Since then, such deals have largely
vanished with the collapse of the junk bond market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chase, like other U.S. banks, is having little
success grabbing its share of deals being done by European
corporations in anticipation of the unification of the
European Community in 1992.</p>
<p>Last year, Chase reported a loss of $665 million, or $7.94
a share, as a result of $1.26 billion in special charges
related to past-due developing-country loans, bad real estate
loans in Arizona and the closing of its London securities
dealer. In 1988, Chase had earnings of $1 billion, or $11.55
a share.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered
its ratings on Chase's senior debt to Baa-2 from Baa-1, as
its levels of problem loans have risen.</p>
<p>Robert Albertson, a securities analyst with Goldman, Sachs
& Co., said Chase has done a "very good job" of reining in
its growth in overhead. As of Dec. 31, Chase had 41,610
employees, down 2% from 1987 levels. Analysts find that
encouraging in light of the fact that Chase's profitable
consumer and transaction-processing businesses continue to
grow and add employees.</p>
<p>Chase recently centralized all of its European back office
operations into a single location in Bournemouth, England;
pared back the scale of its U.S. government securities
operation and sold off its underperforming banks in Belgium
and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>"Every money center is having reductions in staff --
Continental Bank, Citicorp and, bless their hearts, J.P.
Morgan," said Mr. Albertson. "These aren't some shocking
event. They're just paring away."</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties encountered in Europe, Mr. Boyle
said Chase remains committed to corporate finance on the
continent. "Our opportunities in Europe center very much on
the fact that we are a pan-European bank. Nevertheless, there
are activities that no longer offer attractive products for
us. With the lower levels of activity, it's tough all over
the place."</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase
closed at $25.25, down 75 cents.</p>
