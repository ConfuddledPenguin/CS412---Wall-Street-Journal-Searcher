	<p class="article-leader">PAWLING, N.Y. -- Progressive Bank Inc., which cut its
quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents a share from 27.5 cents for
the first quarter, omitted the payout for the second period
and added $5 million to its reserve against possible losses
on bad loans.
   The board omitted the dividend because the real estate
market continues to be weak and nonperforming loans -- those
not earning interest -- have increased, Progressive said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>E. Hale Mayer, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
however, that after the charge, the company's capital stands
at 8.63% of total assets, exceeding regulators' requirements.</p>
<p>Progressive, holding company for Pawling Savings Bank,
last paid out 12.5 cents a share April 30. It currently has
2.9 million shares outstanding. The total reserve for
possible loan losses is $14.5 million.</p>
<p>The company's shares were halted in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday before the market opened.
They last traded at $7.75.</p>
