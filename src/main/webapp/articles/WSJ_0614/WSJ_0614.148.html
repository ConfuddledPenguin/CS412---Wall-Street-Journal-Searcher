	<p class="article-leader">Barclays Bank PLC said yesterday it plans to raise $100
million through an issue of preference shares to U.S.
investors.
   The British bank said the fixed-rate, noncumulative
dollar-denominated preference shares will be redeemable at
the option of the bank in 10 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Brian Worsley, assistant treasurer of Barclays, said the
bank may raise more than the level announced depending upon
market reaction.</p>
<p>He noted that Barclays's entry into the U.S.
preference-share market last year began with a planned $200
million issue, but eventually it blossomed to $500 million
after strong interest was shown among investors.</p>
<p>And he added that Barclays has the ability to raise
additional dollar capital under a shelf registration filed a
number of months ago with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, notifying the SEC that it planned to raise up to
$500 million through additional preference shares.</p>
