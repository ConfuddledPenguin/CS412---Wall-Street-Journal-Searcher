	<p class="article-leader">Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange fell for the
sixth consecutive day, hitting a 1990 low.
   The German Stock Index declined 12.97 points to 1787.39,
its lowest close since Dec. 27, 1989, when the index hit
1771.44.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London shares, meanwhile, closed just off intraday highs,
supported by sterling's strength, Wall Street's firming and
relatively hefty buying of quality stocks by institutional
investors. And Tokyo stocks bounced up from midday lows, with
the Nikkei Index finishing with modest gains after three
consecutive daily losses.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX Index lost more than 20 points in the
first hour of trading amid a wave of sell orders from foreign
institutional investors, breaking through what many experts
regarded as a psychological support at 1800.</p>
<p>But the market quickly bounced back from its low of
1777.66 on position-squaring, and dealers said there was
little activity for the rest of the session.</p>
<p>Traders said that most large institutional operators are
hesitant to invest in the Frankfurt market because the
consequences of German monetary union, set to start July 1,
aren't yet clear. In the absence of major buy orders, even
small-scale sales suffice to push the market gradually lower,
traders said.</p>
<p>"There is no new money coming in," said a trader at a
Frankfurt bank. "The foreigners, who usually drive the
market, already have large German holdings and are now
waiting to see what will happen after July 1."</p>
<p>If the worst fears of inflation in West Germany and
economic chaos in East Germany aren't realized, the market
has a good chance of bouncing back later this summer, he
added.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt market is also suffering from the growing
attractiveness of other European markets, especially London,
which is rallying on hopes of the pound's full entry into the
European Monetary system, traders said.</p>
<p>Chemical stocks were again the main losers in Frankfurt,
hurt by Hoechst's day-earlier prediction of a 10% profit
decline this year. Hoechst dropped 21.20 marks to 264.80
marks ($12.50 to $156.13), reflecting partly the payout of a
13.00-mark dividend for 1989, and other blue-chip chemicals
followed suit. Bayer dropped 7.50 marks to 294 marks, and
BASF fell 4 marks to 290.50 marks.</p>
<p>Schering, a chemical and pharmaceutical issue, tumbled
12.50 marks to 787 marks after predicting flat earnings for
the year.</p>
<p>Electronics stock Siemens also fell, dropping 6.40 marks
to 705.60 marks because of the scaling-down of profit
forecasts by some analysts.</p>
<p>But most other blue-chip shares declined less than 5
marks. In the auto sector, Bayerische Motoren Werke declined
4 marks to 566 marks, Volkswagen eased 1.10 marks to 594
marks, and Daimler-Benz edged down 1 mark to 798 marks.</p>
<p>Among banking stocks, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank shed 2
marks each to 754 marks and 269.50 marks, respectively, while
Dresdner Bank slid 1 mark to 407 marks.</p>
<p>Among the few gainers was retailing stock Karstadt, which
jumped 10 marks to 655 marks.</p>
<p>Tire maker Continental rose 3.80 marks to 312.80 marks on
speculation that the annual shareholder meeting at the end of
June will vote to eliminate the company's 5% voting right
restriction. That could pave the way for an eventual takeover
by another tire group.</p>
<p>In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share
Index gained 34.7 points to 2405.4, after being up as many as
39.6 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said that market's fortunes are tied to Wall
Street. Although some expect London to continue steady, there
is considerable uncertainty and wariness about its underlying
strength.</p>
<p>However, London is also currently heavily influenced by
futures, which are still trading at a healthy premium to
cash. The June FT-SE 100 index contract ended trading
yesterday at 2431.5, up from Tuesday's close of 2398.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index gained 32.2 points to
1933.2. Volume was 611.2 million shares, up from 433.7
million issues Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gains were broad-based, without any one sector benefiting
the most. British Aerospace gained 27 pence to 571 pence (46
cents to $9.73), while BOC rose 18.5 pence to 590 pence.</p>
<p>ICI gained 16 pence to #12.51, as the market discounted
media reports about regulatory concerns over its heart drug,
Corwin. In addition, ICI is expected to benefit from
sterling's entry into the European Monetary System, dealers
said.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues advanced 49.46 points
to 32371.77 on Wednesday. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 450 million shares, in line with 478.6 million
shares Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered gainers 522 to 402,
while 202 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose
191.80 points to 32563.57.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed in the first section edged down, however, slipping
2.15 points, or 0.09%, to 2378.41.</p>
<p>The second section index rose 21.32 points, or 0.52%, to
4086.12. Volume in the section was estimated at 30 million
shares, up from 18.1 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Because of the continuing weakness of the yen and bond
prices, most investors remained on the sidelines, traders
said.</p>
<p>Investors bought stocks with high export ratios, as those
issues benefit from the weaker yen, traders said. But as many
of these shares declined from early highs on profit-taking,
the Nikkei Index gradually extended losses during the
afternoon.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding and other shares that had advanced strongly
earlier this month and then turned downward in the past few
days remained at lower levels most of the day.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Amsterdam, Paris and
Zurich, lower in Milan, Madrid, Frankfurt and Brussels and
mixed in Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed sharply
lower.</p>
<p>Prices also ended higher in Sydney, Taipei, and Manila,
and lower in Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul and Wellington.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
