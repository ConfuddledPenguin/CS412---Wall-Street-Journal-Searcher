	<p class="article-leader">Individual investors poured more than $1 billion into
money-market mutual funds in the latest week, despite flat
yields and near-record highs for the stock market.
   The average seven-day compound yield eased to 7.95% from
7.96% in the week ended Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. Assets of 427 taxable funds tracked by the
Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter grew about $1.2 billion to
$377.1 billion, the highest level since early May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The money came from individual investors, said Martha
Whittbrodt, editor of the newsletter. Assets of funds open
only to institutions dropped about $434 million, she said,
adding that the cash probably went into the rising stock
market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record
high of 2935.19 June 4.</p>
<p>Money-fund yields have been at or just below 8% since
January. The latest slip reflects a general decline in
short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>The average maturity of the funds' investments -- such
things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
Treasury bills and certificates of deposit -- shortened by a
day, to 43 days. The average maturity has been 43 or 44 days
for nine weeks, indicating that a marked change in yields
isn't likely.</p>
<p>Ms. Whittbrodt said yields probably will remain in the
same range until the Federal Reserve acts to change interest
rates -- something she doesn't expect soon.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.65% from 7.67% in the latest week. The average
30day simple yield eased to 7.68% from 7.69%, and the average
30-day compound yield slid to 7.98% from 7.99%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-free money funds fell more sharply,
reflecting the rate decline in the municipal-bond market
since the end of April. The average seven-day compound yield,
for instance, dropped to 5.37% from 5.49%. That's equal to a
7.46% taxable yield for an investor in the 28% tax bracket
and 8.01% for someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>Assets of the 220 tax-exempt funds tracked by Donoghue's
rose about $1 billion, to $77 billion. The average maturity
shortened by a day, to 38 days.</p>
