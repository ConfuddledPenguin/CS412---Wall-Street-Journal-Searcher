	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Money managers often complain about the
difficulty of buying and selling junk bonds. Now some of them
are doing something about it.
   A few major players in the junk bond market have signed up
to try an untested weekly auction of junk bonds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Scheduled to start a month from now, the auctions are the
brainchild of a one-man operation known as New York
Securities Auction Corp., or Nysac. Founded by 32-year-old
investment manager Joel Greenblatt, Nysac says it already has
attracted the attention of a number of heavy hitters
including Fidelity Investments, Mutual Shares Corp., Trust
Co. of the West, 1838 Investment Advisors L.P., Reliance
Standard Life Insurance Co. and others.</p>
<p>Michael Price, who runs the successful Mutual Shares
mutual fund operation, said the new system will provide
another way in which he can search for good buys. "We're
going to try to pick up bargains in Nysac," he said.</p>
<p>The auction bidding will take place via computer and will
be carried on the Bloomberg Financial System of electronic
terminals. Sellers can set a minimum price they'll accept,
much as an art owner might at a Sotheby's or Christie's sale.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenblatt said the auctions should reduce the cost of
trading junk securities and make them easier to buy or sell.
Trading costs and the difficulty of finding trading partners
are sore points in the $200 billion junk-bond market.</p>
<p>Unlike stocks, whose prices are widely disseminated, most
junk bonds are traded through brokers who set their own
prices. As a result, money managers complain that junk bond
brokers sometimes significantly overcharge customers for
their trades.</p>
<p>"Right now, nobody really knows the true price of a junk
bond because of the huge spreads that brokers take on," said
Tom Mandel, a high-yield portfolio manager at 1838 Investment
Advisors. "There is a reasonable amount of deception that
goes on sometimes."</p>
<p>It isn't unusual for junk bond traders to buy bonds from
sellers at one price and resell them at a price as much as
three or even four points higher, investors say. That is an
enormous spread. In the bond market, one point translates
into $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face value.</p>
<p>With Nysac, junk securities will be auctioned at a cost of
perhaps 1/2 to 3/4 point paid by the buyer, Mr. Greenblatt
said. The first auction is planned for July 1618.</p>
<p>Money managers are intrigued by the plan, though they
aren't sure how big the auctions will get. The auctions, they
say, will probably attract the more obscure and distressed
issues of high-yield junk. Less likely to appear are the
"good junk" bonds with such well-known names as Kroger and
Safeway, which trade at relatively small discounts from face
value; these are already easily sold through brokers. Junk
bonds that are actively traded on exchanges, such as those
issued by RJR Nabisco Inc., aren't expected to appear on
Nysac's auction list, either. Nysac said it won't bid on
securities or carry positions.</p>
<p>"The greatest use of this system will be during times of
real distress when the junk bond market shuts down and stops
functioning," said Howard Marks, a managing director at Trust
Co. of the West and a big buyer of junk bonds. "Maybe this
will keep things flowing. It certainly can't hurt."</p>
<p>Mutual Shares' Mr. Price said of Mr. Greenblatt: "This is
a bright young man who is making a serious attempt to try
something new. He doesn't know whether it will work, but he's
trying to bring an alternative."</p>
<p>Money managers appear eager to try the new system, which
they said could serve in some cases as an alternative to
trading through brokerage firms. They said the auctions would
help "open up" the junk bond market, where the government
wants to see price information become more readily available.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenblatt isn't exactly a household name on Wall
Street. He is a managing partner of Gotham Capital in New
York, an investment firm where he says he manages a $40
million hedge fund. Prior to joining Gotham, he was a general
partner at Halcyon Investments.</p>
<p>The securities up for auction, he says, will appear weekly
in an advertisement placed in Barron's, a magazine published
by Dow Jones & Co., which also publishes this newspaper.
Beside appearing on Bloomberg, Mr. Greenblatt said, the list
probably will run on other electronic services in the future.</p>
<p>A bit of skepticism was voiced by Kingman Penniman, a
senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, an
investment research firm. He likes the concept but would
prefer a "completely open" auction where the best bid wins,
even if it's below the minimum asking price.</p>
<p>In addition to junk bonds, Nysac hopes to auction other
"illiquid" securities including obscure investment-grade
corporate bonds, low-priced Pink Sheets stocks and certain
stocks and warrants that trade on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System, or Nasdaq.</p>
