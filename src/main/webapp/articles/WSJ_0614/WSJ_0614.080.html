	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Mikhail Gorbachev wants help setting up his
new office as president of the Soviet Union, so he's turning
for advice to an expert -- White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu.
   In an example of East-West cooperation that once would
have been unthinkable, Mr. Sununu plans to travel to Moscow
to help the Soviet leader figure out how to make his newly
created office at the head of the Soviet government work. Mr.
Sununu will advise the officials who run the office on
matters ranging from the mundane to the substantive, from how
the White House handles several million pieces of mail a year
to how it develops policies and courts legislators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They are structuring a new office, the office of the
presidency," Mr. Sununu said in an interview. "It is a brand
new function, in which a presidency will be responsive to all
the things that follow from political reform, a more
democratic structure with more responsibilities to the
citizens."</p>
<p>The idea of an American president's top aide undertaking
such a mission "is amazing," Mr. Sununu acknowledged. "Never
in my wildest dreams a year ago would I have ever told you
that this kind of openness on all our parts" would be
unfolding.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev's need for such advice arose earlier this
year when the Soviets created a whole new post of president.
Mr. Gorbachev was elected to the job, in addition to his role
as general secretary of the Communist Party -- the position
from which real power traditionally has been wielded in
Moscow.</p>
<p>Mr. Sununu and other administration aides already have
begun lending advice on the presidency to their Soviet
counterparts. As an outgrowth of conversations between
President Bush and Mr. Gorbachev during their recent
Washington summit meeting, a group of six Soviet officials
traveled to Washington this week to meet with Mr. Sununu,
other White House staffers and other U.S. officials to learn
how the White House operation works. President Bush met the
Soviets briefly, and they have been diving into the mechanics
of American presidential scheduling, communications systems
and staff organization.</p>
<p>During the course of their meetings, the Soviet officials
asked Mr. Sununu and some of his assistants to pay a return
visit to Moscow soon to observe how they are putting their
lessons into practice in the Kremlin. Mr. Sununu indicated in
the interview that he intends to accept the invitation.</p>
<p>Mr. Sununu said he hasn't decided when he will go to
Moscow. But he indicated that he wants to let enough time
pass for the Soviets to begin putting their new ideas into
action. "They want to begin to make some changes and get some
things in place so that part of what we can do is see how
they've done it, and see if there's anything we can
contribute by being there," Mr. Sununu said.</p>
<p>It is particularly unusual that the Soviets turned for
help to Mr. Sununu, a hard-nosed conservative who is
considered the protector of Mr. Bush's right political flank.
But the Soviet interest in a Sununu mission suggests the
business of setting up a working presidency is deeply
important to Mr. Gorbachev.</p>
<p>The Soviet leader views the creation of a strong
presidency as a key element in his plan to move the Soviet
Union toward a society run more by democratic government
institutions and less by a rigid Communist Party bureauracy.</p>
<p>The Soviet legislature, itself fostered by Mr. Gorbachev,
established the post of president in March and elected Mr.
Gorbachev to fill the job on March 14. Soon after that, the
White House began getting feelers from the Soviets that they
might be interested in emulating the system used at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue. Yuriy Dubinin, who until recently was
Soviet ambassador to the U.S., discussed the general idea
with Mr. Sununu about two months ago, and new Soviet
Ambassador Aleksandrovich Bessmertnykh raised the idea again
just before last month's Bush-Gorbachev summit.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev held a long day of
informal summit discussions at Camp David, Mr. Gorbachev
peppered his American counterpart with questions about how he
runs his office and stays on top of his job. Finally, Mr.
Gorbachev asked whether he could send some of his aides to
Washington for a first-hand look, and Mr. Bush agreed. This
week's meetings in Washington then led to the invitation to
Mr. Sununu to pay a return visit to Moscow.</p>
<p>Mr. Sununu said he has been stressing that assembling a
staff capable of working together is as important as the
computer wizardry the White House uses to keep a president
informed. And he isn't ruling out the possibility that his
Kremlin counterparts may have a few suggestions of their own
when he visits Moscow. "I'll borrow a good idea from
anybody," Mr. Sununu said.</p>
