	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- John A. Mulheren Jr. took the stand in his own
defense, testifying that he never made illegal arrangements
to buy securities from Ivan F. Boesky.
   Mr. Mulheren's assertions contradicted previous testimony
by Mr. Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator whose
cooperation led to the government's sweeping insider-trading
investigation and to the government's case against Mr.
Mulheren. The 40-year-old Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41
counts of conspiracy, securities and mail fraud and keeping
false records.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Mulheren's testimony was also contrary to evidence
provided during the trial, which began a month ago, by two
other government witnesses. Those witnesses were Michael
Davidoff, a key aide to Mr. Boesky, and Edward McCarthy, a
partner in Mr. Mulheren's former trading firm, Jamie
Securities Co.</p>
<p>Messrs. Boesky, Davidoff and McCarthy had previously
testified that Mr. Mulheren conducted a series of trades that
were designed to generate tax losses for Mr. Boesky's trading
firm and to help Mr. Boesky evade net capital requirements.
They testified that Mr. Boesky's company had agreed to sell
securities to Mr. Mulheren's firm with the understanding that
those securities would later be repurchased. Messrs. Davidoff
and McCarthy said that profits and losses from the trades
were to be borne by Mr. Boesky's company.</p>
<p>But yesterday, Mr. Mulheren said he had no such
understanding of the trades. Mr. Mulheren said he repeatedly
told Mr. Davidoff, who was Mr. Boesky's chief trader, that he
didn't do "those kinds of trades" that didn't involve market
risk and were illegal.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren, once a co-trustee of a trust for Mr.
Boesky's children, testified that he met Mr. Boesky for the
first time in 1976 in a Manhattan restaurant, where the two
dined with their wives and Salim B. Lewis, a former Wall
Street stock speculator. Mr. Mulheren said he recalled that
Mr. Boesky seemed to be "very smart, a little outlandish." At
the dinner, Mr. Mulheren said, Mr. Boesky "ordered most of
the entrees on the menu and picked which one he wanted to eat
after he ordered" from the selection of "six to eight"
dishes.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren said that before he conducted the first of
the allegedly illegal trades, in Unocal Corp. stock, Mr.
Boesky phoned him in mid-1985 and asked if Mr. Mulheren could
do Mr. Boesky a favor and buy stock. Mr. Mulheren said Mr.
Davidoff then called him and said, "I'm going to sell you"
330,000 shares of Unocal stock and "I might want to buy it
back." Mr. Mulheren said Mr. Davidoff assured him that Mr.
Boesky would cover any losses Mr. Mulheren might suffer as a
result of owning the shares. "I said, `Stop right there. I
don't do these trades,'" Mr. Mulheren said he told Mr.
Davidoff.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren said he bought the stock without any
understanding that Mr. Boesky would cover losses.</p>
<p>However, in earlier testimony, Mr. McCarthy offered
evidence counter to Mr. Mulheren's statement. Mr. McCarthy
said that Mr. Mulheren had directed him to keep the Unocal
position separate on Jamie Securities' financial statement
because it belonged to Mr. Boesky -- and not to Jamie.
Yesterday Mr. Mulheren denied that he had ever asked that the
position be kept separate.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren later sold the Unocal shares on the open
market. Messrs. Davidoff and McCarthy have testified that he
was directed to sell the shares by Mr. Boesky, an assertion
Mr. Mulheren denied yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren testified that he was later asked to buy
other securities as a favor to Mr. Boesky, which he did. He
said he never agreed to have Mr. Boesky bear the risk of
those trades.</p>
<p>In earlier testimony, Messrs. Davidoff and McCarthy said
that to compensate Mr. Boesky from securities he bought as a
favor, Mr. Mulheren proposed a scheme in late 1985 under
which Jamie would inflate brokerage bills it paid to Mr.
Boesky's trading company. Mr. Mulheren, who didn't have an
opportunity to respond to this allegation yesterday, is
expected to continue his testimony today.</p>
