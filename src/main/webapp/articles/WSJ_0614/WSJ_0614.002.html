	<p class="article-leader">The city of Concord, N.H., has sold a cache of guns
confiscated from criminals. And the city knows just what to
do with the $2,700 it received from the gun auction.
   Buy some bulletproof vests for its police officers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wait a minute] Isn't that tantamount to a hospital selling
cigarettes in order to purchase respirators?</p>
<p>"Yes," concedes Concord Mayor James MacKay. "But to tell
you the truth, it was so late at night when we discussed
this, no one on the {city} council saw the paradox in what we
were doing."</p>
<p>Paradox or not, the Concord Police Department is
determined to buy the protective gear. "We need the vests,
about 15 of them, actually," says Leo DeGreenia, director of
administration for the Concord Police Department. Concord, a
bucolic city of 36,000, has in the past ignored requests for
vests by its law-enforcement agency. The department has a few
of them, set aside mostly for its SWAT team, but it could do
with a few more.</p>
<p>For example, when police responded recently to reports of
a disturbed individual spraying bullets at the windows of an
abandoned building, most of the officers didn't wear
protective gear.</p>
<p>"It's for a good cause, and protecting police officers'
lives is deemed a good cause," says Elizabeth Hager, one of
the town's councilors who doesn't object to the purchase of
vests.</p>
<p>She, like nearly half the 15-member council, however, did
object to the sale of the guns. "It was more symbolic than
anything," reflects Michael Gfroerer, a fellow councilor.
"Some of us didn't think the city should be getting into the
gun-trafficking business."</p>
<p>About 40 shotguns, pistols and rifles were sold last week
to a Rhode Island gun dealer, who was the highest of 18
bidders. "Just to say we sold the guns to a dealer doesn't
make this right," argues Ms. Hager. "We know where criminals
get their guns."</p>
<p>The measure won council approval by one vote. And Mayor
MacKay was among those who voted in favor.</p>
<p>"Considering the fact that you can go down into
Massachusetts and probably buy an atomic bomb if you want, I
thought discussion on this matter was an exercise in futility
and hypocrisy," reasons Mr. MacKay, a psychologist. "My basic
feeling is firearms are so readily available anyway, if we
can protect the lives of our police officers, let's do it."</p>
