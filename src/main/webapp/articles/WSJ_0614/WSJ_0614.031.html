	<p class="article-leader">Rep. Gerry Studds (D., Mass.), on being attacked by two
youths in Washington, D.C., as quoted in the June 12 Boston
Herald:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I think if they had known I was a member of Congress, I
could have understood it.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>John Sedgwick, writing in the June issue of Wigwag
magazine on Angell Memorial Hospital, an animal hospital in
Boston:</p>
<p>While Angell's expenses are certainly high, they are
nothing like those of human hospitals. By the standards of
human medicine, its prices read like misprints: a day in its
I.C.U., $150; a total hip replacement, $1,200; heart surgery,
$800. Human hospitals run on the assumption that human life
is of infinite value, and charge accordingly. Veterinary
hospitals are forced to make a more conservative appraisal.
Unlike human hospitals, animal hospitals rarely receive what
are termed "third-party payments," the whatever-it-costs
insurance-company payouts that have contributed to the wild
escalation in the price of human medical care. (Currently
only one national insurance company, the Animal Health
Insurance Agency, offers any sort of pet medical insurance. A
catastrophic coverage plan costs $40 a year, has a $250
deductible, and pays up to $2,500 an incident. A
comprehensive plan, for $97.50 a year, has a $50 deductible,
and pays a maximum of $1,000 per injury or illness. Among
Angell's clients, there are few takers; pet owners would
rather take their chances.) At Angell, nearly all payments
are made directly out of the owner's pocket, by cash, check,
MasterCard, Visa, or American Express. So the owner actually
puts a price on his pet, and it's usually not that high.</p>
