	<p class="article-leader">SCEcorp, Rosemead, Calif., said that the Justice
Department won't oppose the proposed merger of the holding
company and its Southern California Edison Co. utility unit
with San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
   The merger was approved by SCEcorp and San Diego Gas &
Electric shareholders in April 1989; it is awaiting approvals
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the
California Public Utilities Commission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Justice Department, a government agency that reviews
antitrust matters, has agreed on conditions that it says
"adequately resolve any concerns" about the impact of the
proposed merger on competition, SCEcorp said.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the combined company would extend
commitments to make transmission capacity in certain areas
available to other utilities. SCEcorp and San Diego Gas &
Electric also agreed they wouldn't enter into any power
purchase contracts with affiliated energy producers without
prior approval of the California commission.</p>
