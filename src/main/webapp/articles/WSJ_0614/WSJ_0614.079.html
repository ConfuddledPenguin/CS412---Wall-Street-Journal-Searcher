	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Group and Daimler-Benz AG are taking
the first steps to extend their nascent global cooperation
into aerospace.
   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the aerospace arm of the
giant Japanese industrial group, said it will set up a study
group with Daimler-Benz to conduct research in four areas:
small passenger planes, engines for those planes, space
technology and ultrasonic aircraft.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two industrial groups announced an agreement in March
to pursue cooperation in a wide range of industries,
including automobiles and semiconductors. This is the groups'
first joint effort in aerospace.</p>
<p>A Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman, however, emphasized that the
latest agreement is only to form a study group that would map
out possible future projects. "This is only the starting
point," the spokesman cautioned. Whether the research would
immediately lead to broader cooperation in aerospace isn't
clear yet, he said. The spokesman said the two groups will
dispatch several engineers later to discuss topics for
research.</p>
<p>There has been considerable speculation since the
cooperative agreement was announced that the two groups would
work to develop a small passenger plane. Mitsubishi Heavy's
chairman, Yotaro Iida, indicated in a recent interview that
the company's agreements with Boeing Co. governing joint
development of long-range passenger jets limits the Japanese
company's freedom to compete with Boeing in the market for
aircraft with 100 seats or more. That limit places greater
pressure on Mitsubishi, which is a relative newcomer to the
international aircraft market, to carve out a niche in the
area of small passenger jets.</p>
<p>The two industrial giants are also considering research
into high-altitude, ultrasonic aircraft that could cut the
flight time between Japan, the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz also has proposed cooperating with Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. in the international motor-vehicle market. The
West German conglomerate has asked Mitsubishi for equipment
to help construct an auto assembly plant it plans to build in
the Soviet Union and for technology for a small-truck plant
in East Germany.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Corp., the trading house that leads the
Mitsubishi Group, is setting up a department to handle
project development with the German conglomerate.</p>
