	<p class="article-leader">There are two Israels. One is the Israel of the Hasbara,
the Hebrew word "explanation," indicating the system designed
to project Israel's image to the outside world, most
importantly the U.S. The other is the Israel that actually
exists. The former is a democratic polity seeking
accommodation with trustworthy Palestinians, tolerant in the
manner of the public image of Teddy Kollek or Abba Eban. The
latter is a state committed to a Greater Israel, set upon the
permanent suppression and/or eviction of Palestinians,
offering one law for Jews and another for non-Jews, unwilling
from the founding of the state to make anything other than
temporary accommodation with the outside world.
   How long can the fiction of the first be maintained? Even
the cosmetic powers of the Hasbara are being strained by the
composition of the latest Israeli cabinet formed by Yitzhak
Shamir. It is clear that this is a cabinet replete with
people openly committed to holding the territories forever in
a colonial status.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The main priority of this new government is to bring in
Russian Jews. Mass emigration from the Soviet Union has been
greeted exuberantly in Israel as the solution to what is
officially called "the demographic problem," the euphemism
for the view that a Greater Israel would contain too many
Palestinians. The racist assumptions are very striking though
normally unquestioned in polite political society. Even the
"dovish" Labor government once proposed a program to
"Judaize" the Galilee. An analogy here would be a political
plan to Christianize New York.</p>
<p>The U.S. posture is more hypocritical. For years the U.S.
has called on the Soviet Union to permit Jewish emigration,
when there was less fear of persecution. Now that Russian
Jews do have justifiable fear of persecution, the U.S.
restricts the quota permitted entry here and, in effect,
forces the refugees to go to Israel. Israel says the new
arrivals are not going to the West Bank. But thousands are
settling in East Jerusalem, the Arab sector once held by
Jordan. Even the U.S. doesn't recognize Israel's annexation
of East Jerusalem. The U.S. should let Russian Jews go where
they wish -- mostly to the U.S.</p>
<p>Palestinians such as recent hungerstriker Faisal Husseini
say they are happy to see Jews escape persecution, but not to
come to the former Palestine from which Palestinians have
been expelled and to which they are not permitted to return.</p>
<p>Hardly were the Palestinians murdered by Ami Popper on May
20 cold in the morgue before Steven Emerson had rushed an
article to this newspaper proclaiming that the "values and
conscience" of Israeli leaders had been splendidly deployed
in the wake of the killings. In my column May 31 I provided
several examples of political realities in Israel and the
occupied territories, very much at odds with Mr. Emerson's
mellow portraiture.</p>
<p>In his June 4 letter, Mr. Emerson asserted flatly that I
misrepresented reports in Ha'aretz and statements by major
Israeli politicians. Did the celebration of the 13th
anniversary of the Elkana settlement on the West Bank,
attended by important Israelis, have anything to do with
Rabbi Moshe Levinger, head of the Gush Emunim (religious
zealots for settlement of the territories) and convicted of
killing a Palestinian shopkeeper, for which he went to prison
after the Elkana celebration? Mr. Emerson says there was no
such account in the Hebrew daily Ha'aretz for May 18 and the
Elkana celebration had nothing to do with Rabbi Levinger.</p>
<p>A substantial part of Gideon Levi's report in Ha'aretz
that day concerned the cordial relations visible at Elkana
between senior officials and Rabbi Levinger. "Who didn't
embrace Levinger?" the reporter asked rhetorically. "The
general commanding the central sector {of Israel and the
territories -- i.e., Gen. Yitzhak Mordecai} shook the hand of
the criminal rabbi warmly, the head of the civilian
administration winked at him with great affection, the
commander of Judea and Samaria spoke to him in friendly
fashion. Yes, he's one of the boys, Levinger, among the
senior commanders of the Israeli army." Mr. Levi noted the
presence of President Chaim Herzog, wearing the symbolic
headwear of chauvinist ultra-right orthodoxy and referring to
Palestinians around the settlement as "foreigners."</p>
<p>Mr. Emerson implies in his letter, though does not state
flatly, that Rabbi Moshe Neriya was not quoted in Ha'aretz
for May 13 as enjoining every Jew "to shoot Arabs left and
right without thinking and without hesitating." But that is
precisely what the Ha'aretz for that day reported him as
saying. Mr. Emerson slyly substitutes a more decorous
statement by the rabbi after the Popper killings, in the
weekly Kol Ha'ir for May 25. The day after Popper opened
fire, an article by Shulamit Hareven, a respected novelist
and essayist, appeared in Yediot Ahronot, the
largest-circulation Hebrew-language newspaper. "You, Mr.
Levinger," Ms. Hareven wrote, "have allowed the shedding of
the blood of those . . . who stood in the road near Rishon
when you said `I am sorry I did not have the privilege of
killing an Arab' . . . You, Moshe Tzvi Neriya, have allowed
the shedding of the blood of the Arab day workers when you
said . . . that `one should shoot right and left.' "</p>
<p>Part of my argument was that Popper's killing spree had
rationality, given the rhetoric of Israeli extremists, from
Mr. Shamir down. Ms. Hareven seems to be making the same sort
of point. Mr. Emerson does not like it when the extremism of
such "respectable" figures as Binyamin Netanyahu, deputy
foreign minister, is cited, with his support for mass
deportation of Palestinians. But that is exactly what Mr.
Netanyahu advocated, as quoted in the journal Hotam on Nov.
24, 1989: "Israel should have exploited the repression of the
demonstrations in China, when world attention focused on that
country, to carry out mass expulsions among the Arabs of the
territories. Regrettably, there was no support for this
policy, which I put forward then and still recommend."</p>
<p>Mr. Emerson claims I believe the Israeli government is
plotting "to exterminate" Palestinians. I believe nothing of
the sort. I think Israeli policy is to maintain effective
control over the territories, with some politicians saying
the ultimate answer is transfer. This transfer-expulsion --
is being seriously raised as a policy option.</p>
<p>I cited the courageous Israeli human-rights activist
Israel Shahak and Mr. Emerson responded by comparing him to
Lyndon LaRouche. This is a fair example of Mr. Emerson's
tastes in polemic, suggesting equivalence between Prof.
Shahak, a concentration-camp survivor, and Mr. LaRouche,
whose movement has been stained with anti-Semitism. Many
people in this country, including scores in congressional
offices, admire Prof. Shahak's integrity and courage. He
appears frequently in the mainstream Israeli press, which
treats him with respect. With his slur, Mr. Emerson dishonors
only himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Emerson's prime role is to whitewash Israeli
governments and revile their critics. Joel Green of Toronto
also wrote an attack directly to me, at the same time as Mr.
Emerson. He opened the rebuke, "I was very happy to hear the
news of your mother's death." In truth, I prefer the demented
passion of Mr. Green to the shabby truth-tampering of Mr.
Emerson.</p>
