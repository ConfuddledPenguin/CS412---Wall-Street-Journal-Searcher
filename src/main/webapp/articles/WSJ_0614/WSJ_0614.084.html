	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Budget Office increased
its estimate of the cost -- excluding interest -- of
resolving the savings-and-loan mess to $150 billion, about
$20 billion more than projected by the Treasury Department.
   The projection is based on the assumption that about 1,700
S&Ls will eventually be seized by the government, and that
losses will accelerate. The CBO in March had put the cost at
$80 billion, based only on the thrifts under government
control at that time. The Treasury has estimated the
government may take control of roughly 1,000 thrifts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady will appear before the
House Banking Committee today; he is expected to ask the
Congress for more cash for the bailout effort. "The CBO
estimate will be the subject of intense questioning by the
committee," said committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D.,
Texas).</p>
<p>Yesterday, William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution
Trust Corp., which must sell the failed S&Ls and their bad
investments, repeated that the agency will run out of cash
required to facilitate the transactions some time in the
fourth quarter. The agency projects it will sell between 50
and 75 institutions, with roughly $40 billion in assets, in
the July-September quarter. "Obviously, if we don't have the
money, we can't continue," he said.</p>
