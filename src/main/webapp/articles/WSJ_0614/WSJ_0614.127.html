	<p class="article-leader">At the University of Texas in Austin, a new student fad
has taken hold: sobriety.
   This spring, a fraternity banned alcohol during the
campus's annual spring fling for high school students. All 28
of the school's fraternities decided to go dry for last
fall's "rush week," the annual debauchery when they recruit
new members. And a non-alcoholic bar has sprouted along
Austin's Sixth Street of honky tonks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These events may put a dent in the university's reputation
as a party school, but "it's just not acceptable to drink and
drive," says Larry Dubinski, a Zeta Beta Tau senior and a
member of the Interfraternity Council at the university. "And
people don't drink as much anymore."</p>
<p>What's happening in Austin isn't an aberration. Across the
country, evidence is mounting that alcohol consumption among
young people is dropping. And that has put the makers of beer
and booze in an awkward position. Many have taken steps
recently to discourage alcohol abuse, especially among the
young. But at the same time, they all market ferociously to
young people, their biggest customers, who are just starting
to develop brand loyalties.</p>
<p>So far, widespread abstinence doesn't seem a serious
threat. But the signs of change are unmistakable.
Non-alcoholic after-prom and after-graduation parties are
spreading -- there's even an annual convention now where
students go to learn how to organize such parties. And
teenagers are starting to like the looks of a dry world.
Lance Rizzo, an 18-year-old from Humble, Texas, who just
graduated from high school, quit drinking about 18 months
ago. "Hangovers, the lost money, the car wrecks are not part
of my life anymore," he says. Is he ridiculed by his peers
for his teetotaling? "Absolutely not," he says. "It seems to
be what's in."</p>
<p>Statistics show consumption is falling faster among young
adults than in the general population. The percentage of 18-
to 24-year-olds who drink vodka fell to 21.9% last year from
32.2% in 1984, according to Simmons Market Research Bureau.
Consumption by people of all ages declined less sharply, to
22.1% from 26%, Simmons says. Even beer, typically the drink
of choice among the young, is slipping: In 1989, 46.7% of the
18-to-24 age group drank beer, down from 56.3% in 1984. Among
the population as a whole, beer consumption eased only 1.6
percentage points.</p>
<p>It isn't easy to pinpoint the roots of this sobering
trend. Certainly, the federally mandated 21-year-old minimum
drinking age has had a big impact on consumption by the
under-21 set. But the most populous states have had
21-year-old minimums for at least three years, yet
consumption continues to drop. And drinking also has declined
in the 25-to-34 bracket.</p>
<p>Health awareness has had an impact: The fitness boom may
be waning, but many people are counting calories. And some
states passed laws in the past 10 years making the hosts of
private parties as liable as bartenders for serving drunks.
"We're in a society right now where people tend to get sued a
lot," says Mr. Dubinski of the University of Texas fraternity
group. Two years ago, the fraternity council adopted a rule
requiring fraternities to provide free taxis or designated
drivers at parties where alcohol is served.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, campaigns to stop underage drinking and to
moderate drinking by party-prone 21- to 34-year-olds have
gathered steam. Since January, Students Against Driving Drunk
has received 400,000 requests for its parent-student
contracts, which stipulate that the kids won't try to drive
when they're drunk. In just 10 years, Mothers Against Drunk
Driving has gathered 2.8 million members. Nearly 80% of all
high schools in the U.S. have SADD chapters, and 400
communities have MADD chapters.</p>
<p>Alcohol-related automobile deaths among 15- to
19-year-olds plunged to 2,170 in 1988 from a peak of 6,281 in
1982, partly because of the drinking-age changes, but also
because "kids began to see that death is related to alcohol
and drug use," says Robert Anastos, the founder and president
of SADD. "They figured out that you don't have to drink and
drive."</p>
<p>Now, brewers and distillers are catching flak for enticing
impressionable youths with their ads. Mr. Anastos cites Bud
Light's Spuds McKenzie campaign. "I think {the advertising}
reaches kids," he says. "I don't think it's their intent, but
I think it reaches them." Mr. Anastos says he was pressured
by critics to stop accepting money from Anheuser-Busch Cos.</p>
<p>Anheuser, which donated about $1.8 million over eight
years as SADD's largest sponsor, says it is proud of its
support for the group. "What's more appropriate than for us
to be involved in this program?" an Anheuser spokesman asks.
He adds that research has shown that advertising "doesn't
cause abuse or underage drinking," and that Spuds McKenzie
wasn't aimed at teens. "It wouldn't make sense to market to a
group that can't buy our product," he says.</p>
<p>In 17 states, bills are pending to restrict alcohol
advertising and marketing. A bill pending in Congress would
require that warning labels, now mandatory on cans and
bottles, be included in ads. And the National Collegiate
Athletic Association last year reduced the amount of ad time
beer companies can buy during telecasts of NCAA tournament
basketball games.</p>
<p>A few alcohol makers have been pushing moderation for
years (Seagram Co. ran ads condemning drunk driving and
underage drinking as far back as 1937), but many more have
joined the chorus recently to blunt the push for ad
restrictions. The Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. sent
out 50,000 requested brochures in the past six months that
focus on the difference between use and abuse of alcohol.
Some 30,000 parents have called to get a copy of Seagram's
"Talking about Alcohol," a cassette tape and booklet to help
parents talk to pre-teens about alcohol. In addition, brewers
and distillers have poured millions of dollars into
public-service ads promoting responsible drinking.</p>
<p>Distillers and brewers fear that many young people have
become what they call neo-prohibitionists, rejecting even
light or moderate drinking. Industry officials grouse about
substance-abuse programs that lump alcohol with illegal
drugs. The University of Michigan's latest annual survey of
high school students shows that the percentage who say
moderate drinking (one or two drinks nearly every day) poses
a "great" physical or mental risk rose to 28.5% in 1989 from
20.3% in 1979.</p>
<p>To counter such attitudes, a series of ads in a new
Distilled Spirits Council campaign, titled "Know the meaning
of the word," tries to differentiate use and abuse. "I think
that it's critical to separate" the two, says a spokeswoman
for the council. "It's an area that's been muddied by the
media and anti-alcohol advocates."</p>
<p>Brewers and distillers have another pressing concern:
making up for sagging spirit sales and flat beer sales. Some
are producing more upscale drinks that carry heftier prices
and profit margins. Higher exports have helped: In 1988, the
latest year for which figures are available, exports rose
46%.</p>
<p>Alcohol makers are hedging their bets by adding
non-alcoholic drinks. In the past year, Anheuser-Busch and
Philip Morris Cos.' Miller Brewing Co. unit have introduced
non-alcoholic beers, O'Douls and Sharp's. (Miller says
shipments of Sharp's in this year's first five months
exceeded its projections for the year, though it won't give
figures.) Guinness PLC of Britain bought Sundance, a
successful new carbonated water and fruit juice drink, from
Stroh Brewery Co., and Adolph Coors Co. began test-marketing
a new bottled water, Rocky Mountain Spring Water.</p>
<p>But the industry realizes those aren't long-term
solutions. Since the 18-to-34 age group, which makes up about
40% of the population, consumes about 50% of all beer, a
decline in drinking in that group has a disproportionate
impact on brewers. So the industry feels it must market more
aggressively to the younger set -- young but legal drinkers,
officials are quick to stress. "They are the trend setters,"
says Emanuel Goldman, a beer-industry analyst with
PaineWebber Inc., San Francisco. "They can provide a product
with momentum."</p>
<p>Distillers would love to emulate Brown-Forman Corp.'s Jack
Daniel's bourbon, which, over the past two decades, attracted
young male drinkers by offering a high-brow image, club
memberships and a masculine, black-and-white print ad
campaign. Today, its consumer profile is significantly
younger than those of other bourbons, says Tim Younkin, Jack
Daniel's marketing director, though he declines to give
specific numbers.</p>
<p>Guinness has fashioned ad campaigns to reach young,
affluent urbanites just starting to form brand loyalties,
says Clint Rodenberg, senior vice president of marketing for
Schieffelin & Somerset, a joint venture of Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton and Guinness that imports wine and spirits. The
company's Tanqueray gin ads, featuring a black-and-white
photo of a woman with green lips, have been placed in Spy, LA
Style and Detail, magazines with young, trendy readerships.
The company sold 14,000 poster-sized reproductions of the ads
at $5 each. The result: The number of Tanqueray gin consumers
in the 25-to-34 age group has jumped 15% since 1985 to 2.7
million. A campaign this summer for the company's new
Tanqueray Sterling Vodka will feature a contest for
up-and-coming rock bands. The vodka will also sponsor
Billboard's music video awards this year.</p>
<p>The light and dry beers hitting the market are likewise
aimed at younger legal drinkers who aren't ready for the bite
of a heavier beer. "What you want is something that the
youngsters will grab onto," says PaineWebber's Mr. Goldman.</p>
