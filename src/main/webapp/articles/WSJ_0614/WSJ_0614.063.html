	<p class="article-leader">Michael Gartner's May 17 Viewpoint, "Subway Beggars Do
Have a Message: Desperation," sadly misapprehends the motives
of transit officials and the courts in restricting
panhandling -- and the stakes involved for our cities and
even the homeless themselves.
   For many of us who are struggling with the challenge of
making New York City and this region a more livable place
despite its density and congestion, it's "nice" to be
lectured to by someone who combines the perspectives of Ames,
Iowa, and New York network-news suites with a dash of Russian
imperial history. He rightly condemns our society's refusal
to address the underlying causes of homelessness, but implies
that subway begging is "saving the lives" and enshrining the
freedom of homeless people.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regular transit patrons and most homeless people here and
in the nation's other cities know better: The accumulation of
destitute people in subways and transit terminals creates a
dangerous and uncertain existence for them and poses a real
threat to public health and safety. The intent of the transit
providers and the courts is not to render homelessness
invisible, but to recognize that all our citizens have rights
that must be balanced against one another when they come into
conflict.</p>
<p>Agencies such as the Transit Authority and the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey understand that
attracting as many travelers as possible to subways and other
transit services is vital to the region's economic and
environmental health. We compete for those customers with
individual auto use and other private-transportation options,
and cannot succeed if transit patrons are subjected to
aggressive panhandling in the confined subway environment or
find that their transit terminals have become homeless
shelters of last resort. Transit patrons should not be
singled out to bear this burden while more well-heeled
citizens insulate themselves in cars, taxis and limousines.</p>
<p>The Port Authority has underwritten onsite outreach
services to homeless people at our facilities and nearby
drop-in centers to connect them with social services and
safer shelter options. We work constantly to distinguish
between the desperate, who need shelter and care, and the
desperadoes, who intermingle with the homeless and make
transit facilities a home base for illicit activity.</p>
<p>Most of the disadvantaged people we encounter do not
prefer the existence of panhandling in transit facilities
that Mr. Gartner so ardently champions. The underlying
objective of our court appeals is to protect the legitimate
rights of our customers while urging more appropriate
societal responses to the complex causes of homelessness. Mr.
Gartner's essay misses the mark. Transit agencies are not
trying, like Potemkin, to erect sham village facades, but to
protect the viability of real cities by providing attractive
public-transit services essential to their survival.</p>

<p>The odds are good that Mr. Gartner doesn't ride the
subways, which accounts for his comparison between the
well-dressed solicitors from organized charities and the
"crippled . . . disheveled . . . wild-eyed" people who beg in
the subways.</p>
<p>As a commuter-rider on the subways I want to assure him
that they do more than merely beg. They smell very bad. They
lie not only on seats in stations but also full length in the
cars. Many of them urinate and defecate among those not
fortunate enough to be driven in corporate limousines,
sheltered to formulate their preachments.</p>
<p>I would have expected Mr. Gartner, as president of NBC
News, not to culminate his "bien pensant" exercise by going
off the rails: Banning begging on the subways doesn't render
them artificial Potemkin shows; it leaves them as real as
they've always been.</p>

<p>Mr. Gartner is half-right in arguing that we should not
ban beggars in the subways if we allow solicitors for
organized charities. Ban them all -- pro-choice, pro-life,
pro-wildlife, pro-zoo. Subways and sidewalks are for moving
people, not for harassing them. If one wants to contribute --
with reasonable assurance that it is not for drugs -- there
are places called churches, temples, mosques, etc., and if
one prefers to support efficient, nonsectarian community
assistance, there are organizations called United Way or
United Fund.</p>

<p>Give me a break, Mr. Gartner. Catherine the Great was
passing through Potemkin Village; I live in New York. I need
to ride the subway, but I use it less and less. In the days
when I paid five cents, I was sure of getting to my
destination without breakdown, harassment, violence, filth or
fear. Now I pay $1.15 and wonder if I will get where I am
going and in one piece. I worry that the subway will never
again function as safe, dependable transportation, and you
want to use it for social welfare]</p>
<p>As a child, I adored standing in the first subway car
peering through the door window fascinated by the changing
lights, the sinuous lines of track in the darkness and the
rushing movement of the train. I still love train rides and
take pride in New York having the only subway system that
functions 24 hours a day and over the longest distances. At
the same time, I use the buses much more while deploring the
traffic congestion, exhaust fumes and the swarms of buses
from the boroughs carrying people at $4 who once rode the
subways but will no longer do so.</p>
<p>I probably feel about beggars in the subway as you would
about beggars in the lobby and halls of NBC. Perhaps we can
get a great constitutional scholar to work on that one.</p>
