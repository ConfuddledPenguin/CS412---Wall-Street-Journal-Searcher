	<p class="article-leader">Houston Industries Inc. said it will record a $23 million
second-quarter charge resulting from the disallowance by
regulators of a portion of its investment in a nuclear plant.
   In the year-ago quarter, net income was about $56.7
million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $950.4 million.
Results for the period included a $26.3 million gain on the
sale of assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Houston-based utility said the charge is related to
the disallowance of $375.5 million of its Houston Lighting &
Power Co. unit's $2.8 billion investment in the South Texas
Project. HL&P holds a 30.8% ownership stake in the $5.4
billion facility near Bay City, Texas. Other owners include
the cities of Austin and San Antonio, Texas, and Central &
South West Corp., a Dallas utility holding company.</p>
<p>The company said the Public Utility Commission of Texas
this week also confirmed a $227 million base rate rise. The
utility implemented that rate increase in June 1989 under a
system that allows utilities to initiate interim rate
increases, pending regulatory approval.</p>
