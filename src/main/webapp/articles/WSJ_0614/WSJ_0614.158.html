	<p class="article-leader">A nonprofit group is launching the first national
environmental seal of approval in an effort to clear up
growing confusion over products claiming to be
"environmentally friendly."
   The Green Seal Inc. program, which is to be announced
today in New York, seeks to provide consumers with a
"reliable" guide for choosing products, while encouraging
manufacturers to reduce waste and pollution. Green Seal would
set standards, test products and award a seal of approval
based on environmental impact during a product's entire life
cycle, from manufacturing to disposal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We want to harness the individual buying decisions of
millions of consumers to bring about real change in the
manufacture, use and disposal of products," said Alice Tepper
Marlin, a Green Seal board member and founder of the Council
on Economic Priorities, a New York-based research group.</p>
<p>There is broad agreement on the need for national
guidelines to stop the current explosion of false and
misleading environmental claims. But critics worry that Green
Seal could add to the confusion if it isn't well coordinated
with other regulatory efforts or if consumers don't
understand what the seals mean.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble Co., a major consumer-products maker,
said seal programs aren't in the best interests of consumers
because they don't provide "full information" describing
environmental claims. "Consumers want to know why a product
has the seal," said Robert Viney, a P&G environmental
official. As currently proposed, the Green Seal wouldn't
include explanations, such as "made of 100% recycled paper."
Mr. Viney also said Green Seal's judgments could be flawed or
inconsistent because there is no consensus on how to do
complex "cradle-to-grave" product comparisons. As an
alternative, he said the Cincinnati-based company supports
proposed federal legislation that would establish "clear
definitions and standards" for environmental claims, such as
"recyclable" or "waste-reducing."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Green Seal has attracted widespread support
from environmental and consumer groups. In addition to Ms.
Tepper Marlin, the directors include Sierra Club Chairman
Michael McCloskey, Worldwatch Institute President Lester
Brown and Natural Resources Defense Council Executive
Director John Adams.</p>
<p>Richard Denison, senior scientist at Washington-based
Environmental Defense Fund, said Green Seal would challenge
industry to meet "aggressive standards" and assure consumers
of "real environmental benefits." But, he said the program
will have to make "tough decisions" on environmental
trade-offs. For example, fluorescent light bulbs conserve
energy and reduce "greenhouse" gases, but they contain toxic
mercury that could cause pollution during manufacture and
disposal, Mr. Denison said.</p>
<p>Green Seal plans to announce today the first four product
categories that it will review. Officials wouldn't disclose
them, but others said they could include energy-efficient
fluorescent light bulbs, recycled toilet paper and tissue
products, recycled motor oil and household cleaning products.</p>
<p>A panel of experts would set criteria for evaluating
products, which would be submitted to independent
laboratories for testing. Companies submitting products for
review would pay for testing and would pay an annual
licensing fee to use the seal on products that meet the
standards.</p>
<p>Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III, a Green
Seal board member and head of a task force investigating
product claims, supports the program. "I felt we had to go
beyond enforcement. We have to help consumers make informed
decisions to help the environment," Mr. Humphrey said.</p>
