	<p class="article-leader">SISTERSVILLE, W.Va. -- Wiser Oil Co. said it began
operating a natural gas liquids plant in Concho County,
Texas, to process gas from the company's Aqaritta oilfield.
   The plant is removing 7,500 gallons a day of natural gas
liquids from 1.2 million cubic feet a day of natural gas,
Wiser said. The gas is being reinjected into the field to
maintain pressure and enhance oil recovery.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wiser said that oil production from the field is 700
barrels a day, and that additional drilling will be required
to delineate the limits of the field. Wiser has a 62.5%
working interest and a 50% net revenue interest in the field.</p>
