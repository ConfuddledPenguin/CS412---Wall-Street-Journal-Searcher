	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The two executives who engineered Merrill
Lynch & Co.'s push into the junk-bond market will give up
management duties as part of a restructuring in Merrill's
investment banking division.
   In a move expected to be announced today, Raymond Minella
and Jeffrey Berenson, who jointly headed Merrill's merchant
banking operations, including high-yield junk bonds, will be
reassigned. Their new role will be to focus "on certain of
the firm's key merchant banking clients and on executing
major transactions," according to an internal memo
distributed late yesterday to Merrill investment bankers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The top-level shifts come as Merrill, saddled with too
many takeover-related loans and troubled junk bonds, is
pulling in its horns and shunning riskier investment banking
deals.</p>
<p>The collapse of the junk bond market last year has left
Merrill, the nation's biggest securities firm, and others on
Wall Street with no way to refinance "bridge" loans
outstanding that they made to help corporate clients finance
takeovers. Merrill has $530 million of these "hung" bridges,
which it is trying to pare down, and $350 million in
junk-bond inventory.</p>
<p>In some ways, Messrs. Minella and Berenson become the
latest casualties of the changing face of the junk-bond
market. In an interview, Barry S. Friedberg, Merrill's head
of investment banking, said the management changes don't
represent demotions for Messrs. Minella and Berenson.
Instead, with the junk market depressed, Merrill sees
management challenges that don't necessarily play to the
strengths of Messrs. Minella and Berenson, he said.</p>
<p>While praising the two men as among the best investment
bankers on Wall Street, Mr. Friedberg said: "All of us have
concluded that given the difficulties of this environment
over the past 18 months, that our interests will be better
served by having them in this role."</p>
<p>As part of Merrill's strategic change, Merrill is setting
up a new department -- High Yield Finance and Restructuring
-- that absorbs the merchant banking machinery that Mr.
Minella, 41 years old, and Mr. Berenson, 40, had run. This
new department will be headed by 37-year-old Thomas Davis, a
leading Merrill merchant banker, and Nate Thorne, 36, who has
run the firm's restructuring business for the past four
years.</p>
<p>Brian Barefoot, 47, continues as head of junk sales and
trading, but now reports directly to Mr. Friedberg, instead
of Messrs. Minella and Berenson.</p>
<p>Messrs. Minella and Berenson, who couldn't be reached to
comment, worked closely together to craft Merrill's strategy
in the $200 billion public junk market. They are credited in
Wall Street circles with popularizing bridge loans; these
temporary loans, to be repaid by selling junk bonds, helped
fuel the explosive growth of takeovers and earned big fees
for Merrill and other firms with deep pockets. And the two
men were instrumental in Merrill's efforts to replace defunct
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as the leading junk-bond
underwriter.</p>
<p>Messrs. Minella and Berenson will continue to serve as
co-chairmen of Merrill's merchant banking commitment
committee, which doesn't have much to do these days. In
merchant banking, Wall Street firms invest their own money,
often along with their clients', in takeovers, leveraged
buy-outs and other deals.</p>
<p>In moving away from the highly leveraged takeover
transactions that filled Wall Street's coffers during most of
the 1980s, Merrill is anticipating that it will make the most
money in the early 1990s from helping to restructure
corporations that took on too much debt during the heyday of
junk bonds.</p>
<p>Now, the junk business that Messrs. Minella and Berenson
used to head has slowed to a crawl. Through June 4, just four
new junk issues have been brought to market by Wall Street,
totaling a paltry $382 million -- a 97% drop from the 55
issues totaling $12.4 billion in the year-earlier period,
according to Securities Data Co. (For its part, Merrill's one
new issue this year, for Sullivan Graphics Inc., raised $100
million.)</p>
<p>The bottom line, Merrill executives say: Just $1 million
in junk-bond underwriting fees for all of Wall Street so far
this year, compared with $36 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Merrill believes the junk-bond and takeover market won't
recover for at least two to three years. Meantime, it wants
to focus on restructurings, or helping troubled firms
recapitalize, refinance and reorganize their operations.</p>
<p>The new high-yield finance and restructuring department
will reflect that focus. Restructurings of overleveraged or
bankrupt companies will be handled primarily by Mr. Thorne,
and "reset" issues and other corporate finance for
less-troubled companies by Mr. Davis.</p>
<p>Messrs. Minella and Berenson are likely to handle more
reset issues than restructurings, people familiar with the
firm said. Resets are bonds on which the issuer has promised
to reset the interest rate by a certain date so the bonds
trade at or near their face value. Reset issues have proven
an enormous problem for some highly leveraged companies that
can't afford to pay the new rates required.</p>
<p>Among Messrs. Minella and Berenson's first jobs is
expected to be RJR Nabisco Inc.'s closely watched efforts to
reset or otherwise handle $6 billion of its junk bonds, Wall
Street executives said.</p>
<p>Merrill officials say emphatically that they want to pare
the firm's bridge-loan exposure, and keep the firm's
junk-bond inventory steady or a bit lower. More important,
Merrill says it wants to protect itself by diversifying its
junk inventory.</p>
<p>Currently, its largest junk-bond position is $50 million
of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino bonds, according to Wall
Street executives. That represents about one-sixth of
Merrill's total junk inventory. Although that's about
one-tenth the total amount of the Taj bonds oustanding, it is
far less than the Taj holdings that Merrill has been widely
rumored to have.</p>
<p>Merrill executives declined to comment on the Taj Mahal
position. Wall Street executives familiar with Merrill's
operations said the firm's junk-bond trading has been
reasonably profitable this year.</p>
