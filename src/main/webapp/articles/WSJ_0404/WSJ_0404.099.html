	<p class="article-leader">On Monday, former federal banking official William Isaac
called the S&L mess "the largest bailout in the history of
the world." Today, the Senate, the World's Greatest
Deliberative Body, may well vote the biggest cop-out since it
violated the U.S. Constitution to slam former Senate employee
Danny Wall into a top job in the thrift bailout.
   A federal judge ruled recently that the Senate's Wall
maneuver skipped the Constitution's clearly stated
appointments requirement. A nomination hearing for Mr. Wall
would have risked airing questions and unflattering publicity
about some of the Senators who've been carrying water for
Charles Keating, the S&L financier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bush administration has nominated a Washington lawyer
named Timothy Ryan to take over the headless octopus called
the Office of Thrift Supervision. Last Friday, the Senate
Banking Committee cleared Mr. Ryan by an 11 to 10 vote, and
his nominaton may come before the Senate for a full vote
today. Senate Banking Chairman Don Riegle, who was on the
losing side of the committee vote, now is attempting to
defeat the nomination on the floor. He is arguing that a
leaked FBI report about Mr. Ryan's flirtation with drugs 20
years ago isn't an issue. "Competence" has become the Senate
Democrats' rallying cry. We think the leaked drug report
deserves some further reflection.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan's voluntary admission to the FBI was leaked to
NBC within hours of the Democrats' loss on the committee
vote. Senator Riegle quickly put out a pro forma statement
about not condoning the leak of raw FBI files, but all
Senators will have to evaluate for themselves, etc. etc.
Meanwhile, every subsequent story on Mr. Ryan's nomination
has had to mention the drug-use incident.</p>
<p>The fact is, win or lose on the Senate vote, the leak
means that Timothy Ryan's professional and personal life in
Washington forever will have this tin bell dragging behind
it. Mr. Ryan agrees to serve his government by taking a truly
awful assignment, and in return gets this nightmare. But
we're not too surprised that Senator Riegle would yawn at a
breach of FBI confidentiality. This is the same Senate that
held a linen handkerchief to its nose while raw FBI data
engulfed a former colleague, Senator John Tower.</p>
<p>Congress, however, does try to defend those who reside
within its walls. Recall the tumult over the false leak
suggesting that Rep. William Gray's office was involved in a
criminal investigation. Under a stern request from Senate
Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden, the Justice Department
committed 11 FBI agents who spent a total of 385 days
unsuccessfully trying to find the leaker.</p>
<p>How many qualified men or women, in the wake of the Ryan
FBI leak, will now consent to subject themselves to this
milieu, especially if Mr. Ryan is defeated? We frankly had
thought that the appointment of Mr. Ryan, a Beltway insider,
was itself a sign that people beyond Washington were refusing
offers to serve. It now appears that Congress will let the
political dogs loose on anyone beyond its own doors. Again,
it was Danny Wall, former Banking Committee Chairman Jake
Garn's aide, who slipped through the normal confirmation
process.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell now talks of
"widespread concern" over Mr. Ryan's qualifications. We are
beginning to wonder if indeed Congress doesn't have cause to
worry about Mr. Ryan's skills. He is a lawyer and his federal
expertise is in enforcement. Not being part of the cozy,
S&L-Congressional old-boy network, he obviously doesn't have
to worry about whom he offends in the thrift business because
it isn't likely that he'll ever be looking for a job with
them. His most noteworthy asset is his independence.</p>
<p>Anyway, wasn't it the "experts" who got the country into
this $200 billion hole? Congress voted the deposit-insurance
limit up to $100,000, which put it way out of Mom and Pop's
league and into the hands of the high flyers. The S&L
"experts" then put billions of dollars into doomed and wild
projects, and the system is now in the tank.</p>
<p>Maybe somewhere out there in America is the one "expert"
who can rescue Washington from its past follies with the
thrift system. But he isn't coming to Washington; he has read
how the city devours its own and he is fleeing from it.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the Senate vote on the nomination
should be viewed as a vote on the fundamental seriousness of
the Senate's commitment to a solution. If, however, the
Senate's vote rolls the thrift supervisor's job into limbo,
President Bush should consider taking control of the
situation by making a recess appointment. Without resolve by
some responsible Washington party, the S&L crisis is going to
turn into another American quagmire.</p>
