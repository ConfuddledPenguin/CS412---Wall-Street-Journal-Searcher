	<p class="article-leader">WORCESTER, Mass. -- Cambridge BioScience Corp. agreed to
acquire a small biotechnology concern, Biotech Research
Laboratories Inc., in a stock swap valued at about $32.3
million.
   Biotech, based in Rockville, Md., will swap all of its 6.3
million common shares outstanding for six million shares of
Cambridge BioScience in a tax-free exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cambridge
BioScience closed at $5.375, down $1.125. Cambridge
BioScience has 10.6 million common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the two companies have complementary
products and technologies, and merging will give them size to
compete more effectively. The acquisition is part of a
continuing consolidation in the biotechnology industry
because of the high cost of product development.</p>
<p>Cambridge BioScience makes screening tests for viral
diseases, primarily acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Biotech Research produces the confirmatory Western Blot test
for AIDS as well as other diagnostics.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Cambridge has been frustrated with cool
market reaction to its five-minute AIDS test. "Getting it to
the market successfully and generating business has been
somewhat of a disappointing story," said Linda Miller, a
biotechnology analyst at PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>Biotech Research has more products on the market and so
with the acquisition, "you instantly broaden your product
line and get a better {product} flow in the future," said
Robert Kupor, vice president at Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>Patrick J. Leonard, president of Cambridge BioScience,
said the merger will result in "significant" new products in
the rapidly expanding areas of HIV and HTLV screening and
confirmatory testing. The first of these new products could
be released to the market as early as the second half of
1990, the companies said.</p>
<p>Mr. Leonard added that the combined companies' technology
will place them in a "strong" position in the overall
world-wide market of HIV/HTLV diagnostics.</p>
<p>In 1989, Biotech had net income of 24 cents a share or
$1.5 million, or 24 cents a share, on revenue of $17 million.
Cambridge posted a 1989 loss of $8.5 million, or 80 cents a
share, on revenue of $8.6 million.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to the approval by the boards
and shareholders of both companies.</p>
