	<p class="article-leader">The performance put on by Jerry Tarkanian's Runnin' Rebels
on Monday night probably would have beaten the Clippers,
Hornets, Heat, Timberwolves, Nets and even the Knicks in
their current state of aggravated nonfeasance. But now the
NCAA may resurrect an investigation of Mr. Tarkanian that was
begun in 1977. Meanwhile, the coaches in Denver were
grumbling about the fact that it is a violation of yet
another NCAA rule for, say, a local business group to pay to
fly the players' parents to the Final Four. The parents of
only two UNLV players made it to Denver. It's a funny system.
UNLV's Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon are sure to go onto to
NBA riches, but we wondered what becomes of the Moses Scurrys
of college basketball? The NCAA, the schools and the coaches
haul in the money that the kids' talents produce, but the
players are under constant suspicion of nickel and diming
payments under the table. Honesty's important, but the
players must find the NCAA's holier-than-thou policies
occasionally confusing.</p>
