	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The clean-air legislation moving through
Congress could have a big impact on U.S. small businesses
from manufacturers and retailers to dry cleaners and auto
repair shops.
   But few small concerns have any idea of the kinds of costs
and confusion they are likely to face in getting permits to
operate or expand their businesses, in purchasing new
equipment or in changing the products they use, say small
business groups. Such organizations have been fighting to
make the measures now moving through Congress more user
friendly for their members by providing for small business
ombudsmen and other regulatory breaks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is a watershed for small business," says Donna
Singletary, a lobbyist who specializes in environmental
issues for the National Federation of Independent Business,
the largest small-business group. "The clean air act would be
a bear even if they passed everything we wanted in
amendments."</p>
<p>The air toxics portion of the Senate bill would require
manufacturers, pest control firms, auto body shops, farmers
and dry cleaners to limit the use of some chemicals or adopt
safer substitutes. To control urban smog, printers, bakeries,
auto repair shops, cleaning and maintenance firms, gasoline
stations and restaurants would face regulation of emissions
from alcohol and petroleum-based products such as paint, ink
and solvents.</p>
<p>"My reaction is help] We need big help," says Raleigh
Carr, who has owned a Richmond, Va., Texaco gasoline station
for 20 years. "It seems like everybody in our government is
trying to put us out of business."</p>
<p>Mr. Carr, whose station has six gasoline pumps, says it
would cost about $5,000 total to equip them with nozzles to
catch the vapors released while filling a car's fuel tank.
But he says he has already spent $14,000 to prevent leakage
from his underground storage tanks, and the insurance company
tells him he needs to spend at least another $8,000 to
install monitors and pressure tests before they'll consider
insuring him. The station's gross revenue amount to $3,000
monthly, he says.</p>
<p>"I'm not against clean air or clean water. I'd like to
help {clean up the environment} but there should be a
reasonable price tag on it," Mr. Carr says.</p>
<p>In New York and its suburbs, it cost many stations about
$30,000 to install the vapor-recovery systems, according to
Ralph Bombadiere, executive director of the New York State
Association of Service Station and Repair Shops. Over the
past two years, he says, many of the area's smaller stations,
with net income of about $600 monthly, decided to stop
pumping gasoline and concentrate on repairing cars.</p>
<p>Small businesses are counting on two amendments to the
clean air legislation to provide some aid. The Senate
approved a change sponsored by Sens. Rudy Boschwitz (R.,
Minn.) and David Boren (D., Okla.) that would direct the
states to offer technical help to small companies that seek
aid. But an amendment by Sens. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) and
Howell Heflin (D., Ala.) to streamline the process of getting
permits to operate was rejected last night. Similar
amendments will be sought in the House.</p>
<p>Business owners will first encounter clean air rules when
they apply for air pollution permits, says Theresa Pugh, the
National Association of Manufacturer's director of
environmental policy. Under the permits amendment, companies
wouldn't have to get permits in all states contiguous to
their home states. Also, smaller concerns could estimate
toxic emissions instead of purchasing expensive monitoring
systems.</p>
<p>"When we go through the permitting process, I want them to
make sure I can do it," explains Bernard Hofmann, chairman of
Hofmann Industries, a maker of steel tubing in Sinking
Spring, Pa. "I don't want an attorney or an environmental
engineer on my payroll. What are we doing: filling out paper
work or providing jobs?"</p>
<p>The dry cleaning industry, heavily dominated by small,
family-run shops, expects to be hit hard by the clean air
legislation. New, non-polluting equipment or "washers" that
dry cleaners eventually will need, cost about $30,000 each.
In addition, dry cleaners are concerned that eventually
they'll be subject to the same regulations as large companies
considered major sources of air toxics.</p>
<p>Perchlorethane, the chemical used by dry cleaners, is
listed as an air toxic. Although a neighborhood dry cleaner
is considered a small or "area" source of pollution, under
the law the government can decide to bunch together small
polluters and regulate them as a major source of the
chemical.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is either I'll have to take less of a
profit or increase prices," says Marc Karyo, 25 years old,
co-owner of Valet International, a large Washington dry
cleaner. "But a good point from my perspective is I expect a
large number of cleaners won't be able to afford the
equipment and I'll get more business when they go out of
business." Valet, with revenue of about $1 million annually,
expects to invest about $100,000 in new equipment.</p>
<p>Even small businesses that aren't affected by clean air
regulations will see their costs increase in other ways.
Retailers will pay increased transportation and delivery
costs, grocery stores might be taxed for using refrigerants
that damage the ozone layer and the cost of cleaning supplies
will increase as they're reformulated to eliminate any
offending chemicals.</p>
<p>"The biggest problem our members have {with the coming
clean air rules} is that they don't know what to do," says
Ben Cooper, director of governmental affairs for the Printing
Industries of America. "Small business people need good
information, consistency and an atmosphere of cooperation
rather than an adversarial one."</p>
