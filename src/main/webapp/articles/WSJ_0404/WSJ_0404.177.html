	<p class="article-leader">National Lumber & Supply Inc. said it filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.
   The Fountain Valley, Calif., company, which last week
closed six of its 21 home improvement outlets as part of a
cost-cutting effort, said yesterday that a slowdown in
Southern California's housing and home-repair markets cut
sales and cash flow, prompting the Chapter 11 filing in
federal court in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>

with creditors.</p>
<p>National Lumber said it believed it has sufficient
financing to maintain operations while in Chapter 11
proceedings. It said it received a $4 million commitment for
debtor-in-possession financing from Foothill Capital Corp.
and is negotiating with its current principal secured lender
to increase credit facilities. An informal creditors
committee was formed March 26.</p>
