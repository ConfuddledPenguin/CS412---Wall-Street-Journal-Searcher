electronics concerns, one in the U.S. and the other in
France. The company, which is a major producer of auto and
truck parts, a defense and space contractor, and a supplier
of computerized information services, declined to state the
purchase price.
   TRW said it bought Wickes Manufacturing Co.'s electrical
division, which has annual sales of about $75 million, and an
80% interest in National Module Systems, Paris, which had
1989 sales of about $11 million.</p>
