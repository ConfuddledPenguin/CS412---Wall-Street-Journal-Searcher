	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- In light of its proposed recapitalization plan,
Georgia Gulf Corp. said its board will omit its quarterly
dividend of 25 cents a share.
   Under the recapitalization, which shareholders are
scheduled to vote on April 19, holders would receive for each
share held $30 in cash, $8.50 principal amount of notes and
one share of a new issue of common. The plan was hatched as
an attempt to fend off Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons who,
through Houston-based NL Industries Inc., began seeking
control of Georgia Gulf last August.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Monday, Mr. Simmons let his $45-a-share, or $1 billion,
tender offer for Georgia Gulf expire, saying he would support
the company's recapitalization plan.</p>
<p>Georgia Gulf, a chemical company, also said it completed
the sale of its Freeman Chemical Corp. subsidiary for about
$65 million to Cook Composites & Polymers Co., a closely held
company based in North Kansas City, Mo. Georgia Gulf plans to
use proceeds to help pay for the recapitalization.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Georgia Gulf closed at $44, down 50 cents.</p>
