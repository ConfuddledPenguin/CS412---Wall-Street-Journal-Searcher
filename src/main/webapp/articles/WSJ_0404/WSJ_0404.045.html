	<p class="article-leader">Your Feb. 22 page-one article about the turncoat
accountant who handed over his client to the Internal Revenue
Service raises the issue of client confidentiality, a
cornerstone of confidence that society places with the
accounting profession.
   That the IRS finds the actions of a blackmailed bean
counter "patriotic" places black hats on the approximately
290,000 members of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the vast majority of whom honor their profession
by faithfully serving their clients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Your article cited 880 IRS "controlled informants," of
whom 40 were accountants (not certified public accountants,
mind you). A chimpanzee can call himself an "accountant"
without passing the rigorous examinations required for
certification. A tremendous amount of reliance is and must
rest with the credibility, to say nothing of the integrity,
of the CPA.</p>

<p>Ours is a voluntary tax system. More important, it is a
complex tax system. Taxpayers, especially those in business,
must by necessity enlist the aid of professional tax
preparers to report their income. While a professional cannot
force a client to take advice, it seems obvious that most
clients do. If the IRS continues its insidious practice of
hiring professionals as moles, no one in his right mind would
trust his accountant. Does the IRS think that its collections
would increase if more individuals prepared their own
returns? Get real]</p>
<p>Michael Orth, the assistant regional commissioner in your
article, confuses patriots with mercenaries and informants
with snitches. James Checksfield betrayed a position of
trust. He is no patriot. He is a snitch. If Mr. Orth does not
understand either character, he need only ask any
sixth-grader.</p>

<p>CPAs work hard to earn the confidence of the public, and
integrity is the hallmark of our practice. If our clients
cannot entrust us with the integrity of their personal
finances, often their financial plans and problems, what is
our purpose? Communications between clients and accountants
should be protected as confidential. And no CPA worth his
salt should violate the ethical standards that we profess.</p>

<p>I truly believe that the problems depicted in your article
can be resolved by placing a reporting burden on the
accounting profession much like the congressional mandate for
drug-money laundering within the banking industry. Banks
report unusual financial transactions that fall into suspect
parameters to U.S. authorities. For a time, as a banker, I
resented this so-called "social obligation" because I
couldn't believe a banker could knowingly aid such illegal
activities. Anyone who can read now knows such activity did
occur knowingly and was widespread. Is there a correlation?
Maybe yes, maybe no. However, I believe the accounting
industry and the IRS must avoid any sanctimonious attitude
and resolve the issues through congressional action similar
to the drug-money-laundering legislation.</p>
