	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- In the midst of a long-running cash
crunch, HealthVest said it had entered into a standstill
agreement with its lenders. The agreement halts foreclosure
proceedings under way on three properties owned by the real
estate investment trust.
   The owner of 37 health care-related properties also
announced it was delaying the filing of its 1989 10K report
to allow outside auditors more time to assess property
appraisals expected to result in material asset write-downs
for the year ended Dec. 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The standstill agreement is subject to certain conditions,
including the execution of various mortgage documents; it
will terminate if conditions are not met by April 30, 1990,
the company said. Under the agreement, HealthVest agreed to
make monthly interest payments to its lenders rather than the
previous quarterly and semiannual payments. Each lender will
be given mortgage interests in properties pledged as
collateral for the respective lenders.</p>
<p>In return, the lenders have agreed to refrain from
foreclosing on any mortgage property until Dec. 14, 1990, if
HealthVest remains in compliance with the agreement. During
the standstill period, the company said it will continue
trying to restructure lending agreements on more than $253
million in debt. The lenders involved include Chemical
Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank, the Bank of Tokyo, a group of
European banks and several U.S. insurance companies.</p>
