	<p class="article-leader">General Electric Co. of Britain, an electronics and
industrial engineering company, and Siemens AG of West
Germany, an electronics concern, announced plans for dividing
ownership of the businesses they acquired last year after a
takeover battle for their smaller British rival, Plessey Co.,
for #2.04 billion ($3.34 billion).
   The two giants intend, as expected, to maintain joint
ownership of only one major Plessey business, GPT, a
telecommunications-equipment maker, and to divide or sell to
third parties Plessey's remaining electronics units.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S. company of the same
name, is to take control of Plessey's avionics, aerospace and
naval systems businesses, both in Britain and the U.S.
Siemens will own Plessey's radar, defense systems and
controls units. The two companies will remain joint owners of
several properties, including GPT, which had been a joint
venture between GEC and Plessey.</p>
