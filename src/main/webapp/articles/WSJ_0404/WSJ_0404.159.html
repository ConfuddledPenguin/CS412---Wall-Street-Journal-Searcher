	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A late-day rally in the futures market spilled
over into bonds, lifting prices modestly even though trading
activity nearly dried up.
   Traders said buyers entered the bond futures market just
before the close of trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Many of the buyers were rushing to cover short sale
positions. But when trading ended in Chicago, some investors
started buying bonds in the cash market on Wall Street.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors put on short positions when they sell securities
that are borrowed from dealers or other investors.
Essentially, they are betting that prices will fall and that
they can profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended nearly 1/4 point
higher, a gain of about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, eased to 8.61% from 8.62%.</p>
<p>Traders said few retail investors participated in the
brief futures-related buying activity. That's because retail
investors focused instead on Resolution Funding Corp.'s next
40-year offering of so-called "bail out bonds."</p>
<p>Refcorp, a government agency created to finance the
federal bailout of the nation's troubled savings and loan
industry, said it would announce details of the 40-year bond
auction today.</p>
<p>A primary concern for investors is the size of the
offering. The Treasury has officially said that the size of
the 40-year auction will be between $3 billion and $5
billion. However, government dealers said Treasury officials
have suggested that the size of the next 40-year bond sale
will be smaller than the agency's first offering on Jan. 23,
which totaled $5 billion.</p>
<p>According to several dealers, Deputy Assistant Treasury
Secretary of Federal Finance Michael Basham has said that the
40-year bond sale would have gone more smoothly if $4 billion
instead of $5 billion had been auctioned in January.</p>
<p>The strong demand widely expected for the 40-year bond
sale in January never materialized, and, as a result, many
considered the auction to be a flop. Bond prices fell a full
point within minutes of the release of that auction's
results.</p>
<p>The sale was closely watched by the bond market because
the U.S. Treasury has not sold 40-year bonds since 1955, and
recently, only one government agency, the Tennessee Valley
Authority, has sold 40-year securities.</p>
<p>"In discussing the 40-year bond sale, Refcorp officials
had said it was the last $1 billion that killed the auction,"
said F. Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone &
McCarthy Research Associates Inc. "Thus, they're likely to
come with about $4 billion," he said.</p>
<p>Louis Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson &
Associates Inc., said that because the first 40-year bond
sale was a disaster, "the Treasury is handling this auction
extremely carefully."</p>
<p>Mr. Crandall said that last 40-year bond auction went
poorly because it was held too close to the quarterly
refunding and because it was held on too short notice. But
this time, he said, "the Treasury is going to great lengths
to make sure those problems aren't repeated." Next week's
40-year Refcorp bond sale will be held a month before the
Treasury's next quarterly refunding.</p>
<p>Treasury, Agency Securities</p>
<p>Prices of Treasury bonds rose as little as 1/32 and as
much as 6/32 point.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
98 23/32 to yield 8.61% compared with 98 17/32 to yield 8.62%
on Monday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 99 2/32 to yield
8.62% compared with 99 to yield 8.63%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were little changed. The discount rate
for three-month Treasury bills was 7.83% yesterday for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8.08%, unchanged from Monday's
auction rates. The discount rate on six-month bills was 7.82%
to yield 8.23%, slightly higher than Monday's auction rates.</p>
<p>In the agency market, Federal National Mortgage
Association priced $700 million of callable seven-year
debentures at a price of 99.875 to yield 9.275% and $800
million of noncallable 10-year debentures at par to yield
9.05%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Officials at Resolution Trust Corp. said the agency will
approve a plan under which it would pay interest on
mortgage-backed bonds and some medium-term notes issued by
financial institutions taken over by federal authorities.</p>
<p>The possibility that RTC would decide not to make interest
payments on such debt prompted major rating agencies to place
more than $20 billion of securities issued by U.S. thrifts on
their watch lists with negative implications.</p>
<p>But yesterday, RTC Chairman William Seidman said at a
board meeting that "we will be affirming the contract and
interest rate {on such securities} until the date of
payment." RTC is the government agency created to manage the
nation's savings and loan bailout.</p>
<p>The announcement had little impact on the mortgage-backed
securities market, where most prices ended unchanged.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
April delivery, for example, were unchanged at 95 24/32.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Prices of Southland Corp.'s pay-in-kind junk bonds rose
yesterday despite Monday's news that the firm had a loss of
$1.01 billion in the fourth quarter and that it warned it may
be forced to seek bankruptcy court protection. Southland's
pay-in-kind bonds, which pay interest in the form of
additional securities instead of cash, advanced more than two
points to close at 33 1/2.</p>
<p>Junk bond traders said Southland PIKs are senior
securities, which makes them attractive, particularly in a
potential reorganization or bankruptcy. Typically, when a
company enters bankruptcy-law proceedings or reorganizes,
senior bond holders get paid first.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc., which had been surging
recently, ended unchanged to modestly higher yesterday.</p>
<p>In the broader junk bond market, prices were mixed.</p>
<p>Activity in the investment-grade corporate debt market was
brisk as corporate issuers offered more than $600 million in
new debt.</p>
<p>Among the issuers was United Telecommunications Inc.,
which offered $250 million of notes priced to yield 9.84%.</p>
<p>Strong investor demand prompted underwriters at Dillon
Read & Co. to boost the size of United Telecommunications'
debt offering from an originally planned $200 million.</p>
<p>Syndicate officials said the issue sold out.</p>
<p>In a recent shelf filing with the Securities & Exchange
Commission, United Telecommunications said proceeds from a
debt offering will be used to redeem a $200 million issue of
7.5% senior notes, to refund a portion of commercial paper
debt outstanding and for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p>Also in the market was Ford Motor Credit Corp., which
offered $200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 9.50%.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded issues were unchanged to 1/8 point higher.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues were basically unchanged, with some
issues 1/8 point firmer in late dealings.</p>
<p>For the second day in a row, activity centered on the
primary market as secondary-market dealers pondered the lack
of movement in their sector.</p>
<p>If municipals follow the lead of U.S. Treasurys, little
price fluctuation is expected ahead of the U.S. March
employment data scheduled for release Friday.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Japanese government bond market ended stronger on the
recovery of stocks and the yen in Tokyo and ahead of the
10-year yen bond auction expected Thursday.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 158.95 yen, down from the 159.95 yen
close in Tokyo on Monday. The Nikkei index of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange ended 757.65 points higher on the day, after falling
1978.38 points on Monday.</p>
<p>Bond dealers expect the coupon rate on the new 10-year
bond that will be auctioned Thursday to be 6.8%, which is
0.40 percentage point higher than the rate set on the bonds
at the previous 10-year government bond sale.</p>
<p>Dealers said the new bond is a good candidate to be the
next benchmark bond. The current benchmark, the No. 119, has
become scarce in the market because the Finance Ministry has
bought a total of around 180 billion yen of the issue in its
recent bond-buying operations. Because of its scarcity, and
its relatively low coupon of 4.8%, dealers say the No. 119
has lost a lot of its attractiveness as a benchmark.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, the No. 119 ended at a price of
about 86.44, up 0.45 point to yield 7.26%.</p>
<p>West German bonds ended weaker in aimless trading.</p>
<p>Some dealers attributed the market's woes to continued
nervousness over monetary union between East and West
Germany. The public debate among important West German
politicians and central bankers over whether most East marks
should be converted at a two-to-one rate erupted over the
weekend.</p>
