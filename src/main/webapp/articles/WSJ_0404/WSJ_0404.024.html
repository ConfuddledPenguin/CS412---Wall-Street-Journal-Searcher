	<p class="article-leader">Anson Shupe's March 9 editorial-page article, "Pitchmen of
the Satan Scare," represents yet another illustration of the
muddled double-think. Mr. Shupe bemoans the fact that
satanism has become a growth industry with authors pandering
to a willing public. Yet he is identified as a professor
"preparing a book on cult and Satanic phenomena in the U.S."
   He selectively criticizes certain specific commentators or
statistics as being unproved or speculations, and utilizes an
attack on those few to denial of an emerging social concern
and contemporary problem. That is not odd for him. In fact,
it is consistent with the same approach he and some of the
authorities he cites took with respect to destructive cults.
The recommendation of a posture of "benign" neglect toward a
social evil does not originate with Mr. Shupe, although I
find it odd that he adopts that precise appellation in
describing a satanic group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Shupe's not-surprising conclusion, that evil has
always existed, is no more a warrant for ignoring a growing
problem of abuse and violence directed toward the vulnerable
than it would have been to refuse to deal with other forms of
discrimination against the weak and underprivileged on the
ground that these also are inevitable consequences of human
frailty.</p>
<p>His unrestrained attack upon the credibility of victims of
a widely perceived social problem really is tantamount to a
call for denial. The Cult Awareness Network characterized by
him as a group that has "now sounded the Satanist alarm in
earnest" reports it receives more than 300 calls for
information a month. What is it Mr. Shupe suggests should be
the appropriate response? Shut down the phones? Direct the
calls to Mr. Shupe himself, who will tell the people calling
that this, too, will pass and that every day in every way
things are getting better and better?</p>
<p>Underlying the widespread demand by responsible
professionals for workshops and seminars is a growing
sensitivity to the victims of violence and abuse. The
American Family Foundation and the Cult Awareness Network's
focusing upon victims and attempting to deal with prevention
and treatment are approaches that are antithetical to Mr.
Shupe's characterization as a retreat to "medieval" thought.
Rather it is the cloistered professionals who do not hear the
violence in the street below or the cacophony of calls to
racial hatred and violence that are in retreat from
commitment and concern.</p>

<p>Mr. Shupe says that "genuinely concerned professionals are
being exposed, under the guise of technical training, to
downright misleading, false and poorly assembled
information." He marshals a good deal of evidence to express
his concern for these professionals and how they seem to be
unable to determine what information, technical training,
etc. are faulty, if indeed they can determine it at all.</p>
<p>As a practicing theologian and psychotherapist, I have
been professionally involved in the entire issue of what Mr.
Shupe calls "the Satan scare." While I share his concern
about those irresponsible individuals who would make and/or
have made a great deal of money by misleading those who may
be neophytes in the field, I can assure him that competent
professionals are under no such draconic deception.</p>
<p>Most of us who have been treating people of all ages, but
especially young people who have been "Satan worshippers,"
know that this is a severe and disabling emotional condition
often with overtones of psychosis and/or sociopathy. There
are also usually evidences of paranoia and sometimes
depression that could and do lead to self-immolation and/or
suicide. Often, and tragically, hostility and belligerence
are present leading to the physical injury of others.</p>
<p>In any event, the situation is serious enough to not
dispense with the subject as if it were simply involving a
group of people giving popular lectures to those who cannot
effectively criticize or analyze the worthiness of these
lectures.</p>
<p>Responsible religious leaders as well as health
professionals are able to provide professional assistance but
are in short supply when compared with the number of people
who suffer from Satan malady. It is interesting to note that
in the Hebrew language the word Satan refers to a condition
alluded to by Numbers: 22 f.f., in which one has lost all
free will and cannot turn in any direction. The reference is
an apt one. Most of our patients who have this "satanic"
affliction have lost their free will to act; therapy and
healthy religious practices are ways of restoring their life
options to them.</p>
