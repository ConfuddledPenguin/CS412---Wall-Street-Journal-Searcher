	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Middle Eastern buying lifted gold prices, but
by far less a degree than Middle Eastern selling sent gold
reeling a little more than a week ago.
   June delivery gold ended with a gain of $5.60 an ounce at
$380.10 after rising as much as $7.90 in early trading. May
silver rose in sympathy, advancing six cents an ounce to
$5.0380. July platinum rose $4.90 an ounce to $483.00.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was a market that was ready to rebound," said Jeffrey
Nichols, president of APMA (Canada) Ltd. of Toronto,
explaining why prices shot up in reaction to estimated
purchases of only 25,000 ounces of gold in London.</p>
<p>That quantity was infinitesimal compared with as much as
four million ounces that were thought to have been sold on
March 26, when gold plunged nearly $30, Mr. Nichols noted. A
contributing factor to yesterday's advance was that many
futures traders bought back contracts they had sold last week
in anticipation of prices falling further, he said.</p>
<p>Some support for gold may come out of the scheduled
meeting of the seven major industrial nations this weekend in
Paris, where means to curb the strength in the dollar
certainly will be discussed, Mr. Nichols said.</p>
<p>Also, he noted, there were reports that Japanese monetary
authorities were putting pressure on institutions to
repatriate funds and use them to support the yen.</p>
<p>Both of these factors would be positive for gold because
the strong dollar has kept gold under pressure, he said.</p>
<p>Despite these potential bullish elements and yesterday's
comeback, Mr. Nichols noted, "the market still bears the
psychological scars of last week's hit and the general
consensus is that it has a long way to go to regain the
confidence it had at that time. My feeling is that it's still
vulnerable to further selling and declines."</p>
<p>Contributing to this weak condition is the lack of recent
support from the Far East, Mr. Nichols said. "Far Eastern
demand for gold, principally from Japan, was a major
price-strengthening influence last year. This has been absent
for the past two months as many investors have liquidated
holdings to cover losses in equities."</p>
<p>Also, he said that the weakening yen has resulted in
higher yen-denominated gold prices, which damped demand for
the metal.</p>
<p>In the wake of last week's sales, Nauman Barakat, first
vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York, noted
that "it wouldn't be out of character" for Middle Eastern
traders to sell the market in anticipation of buying gold
back later at lower prices. Is that what happened yesterday?</p>
<p>"Well, it would appear that way," Mr. Barakat said. "It is
their custom to trade along those lines."</p>
<p>Another analyst attributed even more devious motives to
the buying. "I wouldn't be surprised at all if Middle Eastern
traders are buying to strengthen the market so they can sell
gold again from a higher level," said William O'Neill, vice
president of research for Elders Futures Inc.</p>
<p>A more likely scenario, Mr. O'Neill said, "is that if
these buyers don't follow up with more demand, the market
will give up the gains."</p>
<p>If the Middle Eastern buying has done nothing else, he
said, "it's taken the focus away from the dollar for the
moment." Yesterday, the dollar was mixed against major
currencies.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices rose on rumors that there had been
a landslide near a major copper mine in Chile. The May
delivery gained 3.95 cents a pound to $1.2485, after trading
at a new life-of-contract high of $1.25. Analysts said the
reports of the landslide near the El Teniente mine couldn't
be confirmed, but one analyst noted that the geological
character of the area where the mine is located is unstable
and that a landslide was possible. Fundamentally, though,
analysts said, the market continues to be supported by strong
demand for copper and tight supplies. A rally in the New York
stock market was also a positive factor for copper because it
helped traders to take a more optimistic view of the U.S.
economy and continuing demand for the metal.</p>
<p>ENERGY: The first day of trading in the new natural gas
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange was a busy one
-- and volatile. Both traders and exchange officials were
enthusiastic. "The opening was very positive," said Eric
Bolling of Edge Trading Corp. "Initial activity validates our
research and development that points to a promising future
for natural gas futures," said Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of
the exchange board. There were 925 contracts traded, about
double expectations. Each contract unit contains 10,000
million British thermal units of gas, or some 10 million
cubic feet. Initial prices also were slightly higher than had
been expected. Trading opened for the June contract at $1.60
for one million BTUs, higher than the spot price of $1.46 or
$1.47. It settled at $1.635 after reaching the day's high of
$1.655. As for the potential of gas futures, "it's going to
take time, but the interest is there," said Christopher Bray,
a trader with PaineWebber Energy, Boston, which was among
those claiming to have made the first sale of the new
contract within seconds of the opening bell.</p>
<p>COCOA: Futures prices rose sharply on reports that
Nigeria, one of the world's major cocoa producers, might
change its cocoa export policy. The May contract rose $52 a
metric ton to $1,215. Reports continued to circulate that
Nigeria was considering banning exports of raw cocoa beans as
of Jan. 1, 1991, in favor of shipping finished products such
as cocoa butter and liquor, which are used in the manufacture
of chocolate, according to Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton in New York. "This news was seized upon by
traders to justify concern about the availability of cocoa in
the wake of a price rally to about a nine-month high from a
14-year low of $900 a ton last fall," Ms. Kaul said. Nigeria
is unlikely to implement such a policy because its processing
capacity isn't able to handle its whole crop, she said.
Prices have risen recently because the industry is between
main and midcrop harvest seasons, and with most of the main
crop supplies already sold producers have very little cocoa,
according to Ms. Kaul. Also a price-firming factor, she
noted, was that the International Cocoa Agreement has been
extended for another two years, eliminating the prospect that
the agreement's 250,000-ton buffer stock of cocoa beans would
be dumped on the market. James Roemer, meteorologist for
Weather Trades Inc., of Des Moines, Iowa, noted that dry
weather in the Bahia cocoa-growing area of Brazil had caused
trade companies there to reduce their mid-crop forecasts and
that West African cocoa-growing areas have had only a quarter
of their normal rainfall in the past two months. Also, he
noted, there has been some warming of ocean waters in the
central Pacific Ocean off the coasts of Chile and Peru, a
phenomenon known as "El Nino." Historically, the warming of
these waters has caused dry spells and droughts in Brazil and
in the West African cocoa-growing areas, such as the Ivory
Coast, Nigeria, and Cameroon, Mr. Roemer noted. The critical
growing period for cocoa in that area of Africa is between
May and September, he said. The possibility that El Nino may
be forming isn't a major factor now, "but it bears close
watching," he said.</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures contracts
rebounded from Monday's sharp retreat. Soybean prices had
slipped Monday in the wake of a government report that U.S.
soybean farmers intend to plant more acres this spring than
expected by grain traders. A short-covering rally late
yesterday helped push up soybean prices. The rally spilled
over from the corn pit, where the prices of corn contracts
for delivery next year hit new life-of-contract highs. Prices
of wheat futures contracts also rose.</p>
