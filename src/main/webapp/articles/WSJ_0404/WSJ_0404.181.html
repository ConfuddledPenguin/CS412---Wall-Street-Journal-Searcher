	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- TRW Inc. has sued a "credit services
organization" for advising consumers to flood TRW with credit
report disputes and lawsuits and also for possibly tampering
with the company's computer system.
   In a complaint filed in state court in Los Angeles, TRW
claims that Michael Jay & Co., which promotes itself as "the
credit repair people," was telling clients to dispute their
credit records without pointing to any particular inaccuracy
in the hope that TRW would be unable to verify negative
information.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This letter-writing campaign has resulted in TRW
literally being inundated with thousands of
computer-generated form letters, purporting to raise the same
`disputes' by the same consumers over and over again," the
complaint said.</p>
<p>The complaint also says that Michael Jay has attempted to
access or has accessed TRW's computer system in order to
disrupt it.</p>
<p>The result of Michael Jay's actions, says TRW, has made
the maintenance of accurate records more difficult and has
forced TRW to continually reverify financial information. It
has also, allegedly, made it more difficult to respond to
legitimate complaints.</p>
<p>The suit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction
against counseling consumers to make false claims or file
lawsuits. TRW also wants the return of any material taken by
unauthorized access to its computer system.</p>
<p>Michael Jay, president, said his company doesn't have any
access to TRW's computer system and has never attempted to
interfere with it. "We would never advise a consumer to
mislead anyone; in accordance with state and federal laws, we
do advise consumers to challenge information they believe is
unjustly reported on their credit reports."</p>
