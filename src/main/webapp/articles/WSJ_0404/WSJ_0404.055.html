	<p class="article-leader">Competition in the auto industry can be pretty
freewheeling.
   But even some internationally savvy auto executives were
rattled last week when they began receiving promotional
material for a new South American car with five-wheel drive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For three consecutive days, the officials received Federal
Express packages containing copies of ads for the Caballo XL.
The text described how the "world's first and only five-wheel
drive" car "integrated the steering wheel to the seat"
eliminating "all of the bone-shattering vibrations that can
rob" drivers of control.</p>
<p>The ads also included nature scenes not unlike Nissan
Motor Co.'s Infiniti ads, and an illustration of an
attractive red coupe.</p>
<p>An accompanying letter from "Hoffman York PLC, a
world-wide marketing resource," ominously warned that the
South American model "is really aimed at the United States."</p>
<p>That was all some of the executives needed to sit up and
take notice. "We literally thought, `not another {competitor}
coming in,'" says George Garbutt, vice president and general
manager of Maserati Automobiles Inc.</p>
<p>Officials at Infiniti reasoned that if Yugoslavia could
sell cars in the U.S., why not Argentina? And Tony Kirton,
Audi of America's marketing director, says, "I looked at it
and wondered if this {technology} really works." To find out,
he immediately shipped the information to Audi's product
planners for investigation.</p>
<p>He needn't have bothered. Earlier this week, letters from
Hoffman York & Compton, a small Milwaukee advertising firm,
began arriving on the desks of the 56 auto executives who
received the packages. The letters explained that Hoffman
York, which has had trouble lining up a car account, wanted
to prove it could play in the big leagues. So it dreamed up a
car and bogus ads for an April Fool's hoax.</p>
<p>"Everybody is interested in what a competitor is doing,"
explains Tom Jordan, Hoffman York's creative director. "We
figured that if we could convince real auto makers about the
existence of a car they'd never heard of before we might win
some business."</p>
<p>Some of the executives concede they were impressed, if not
swayed to switch accounts. "Interesting ads, interesting
pitch, interesting car," says Joseph Hickey,
corporate-advertising director for Chrysler Corp. "Too bad
all of our agencies are already hard at work for us."</p>
