	<h3>Marketing & Media: Chrysler Provides Yet Another Twist In Buyer Incentives --- Purchasers of Minivans Get Offer of Possible Rebate, But There's a Big Catch</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp., the auto maker
that pioneered the rebate, has invented the non-incentive
incentive.
   The No. 3 auto maker is guaranteeing consumers who buy a
1990 minivan between April 1 and Sept. 30 that they will get
the amount of any rebate that may be offered on the vehicles
during the six-month period. The only catch is, Chrysler
isn't offering any rebates on minivans, at least not now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Specifically, Chrysler said it isn't resuming the $1,000
cash-back incentive it adopted during January on Caravan,
Grand Caravan, Voyager, Grand Voyager and Town and Country.
And company spokesmen say there aren't any plans to reinstate
the program, which guaranteed consumers that they would get
the difference if Chrysler announced a higher rebate on the
vans before the Sept. 30 end of the 1990 model year.</p>
<p>But Chrysler's minivan sales plummeted from almost 64,000
in January -- more than double the normal sales rate -- to
fewer than 20,000 in February. March is expected to be only
slightly better; final totals are due today. Also, General
Motors Corp. recently began offering $1,000 off on its new
plastic-body Chevrolet Lumina APV, Pontiac Trans Sport and
Oldsmobile Silhouette minivans. And Ford Motor Co. raised the
rebate on its Aerostar minivans to $750 from $500.</p>
<p>So Chrysler dealers -- feeling pressure from consumers --
have pushed the auto maker to do something to boost sales of
what has been Chrysler's most popular product. The program
announced yesterday is the result. A Chrysler spokesman said
the auto maker doesn't plan to advertise it, but will send
dealers a "wall-poster-size dealer-gram" with a message from
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca urging customers to "buy now and be
assured that Chrysler wants you to have the best deal
possible."</p>
<p>Wouldn't resuming the rebates be simpler? Perhaps, but
Chrysler doesn't want to lose any income from one of its most
profitable vehicles. In addition, the auto maker has said it
fears it could run out of minivans because the two plants
that build the models will be closed for four weeks this
summer. Chrysler is substantially changing the vehicles for
the 1991 model year.</p>
