	<p class="article-leader">Northrop Corp. said it chose an investment manager, U.S.
Trust Co. of California N.A., to purchase Northrop common
stock for the company's retirement plans.
   Analysts said the proposed stock purchases might help
Northrop protect itself against a hostile takeover attempt.
Northrop has undoubtedly watched with interest recent events
at Lockheed Corp., another Southern California aerospace
concern, which appears to have won a hard-fought proxy
contest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I don't think there is any immediate concern {at
Northrop}; only ongoing watchfulness," said Lawrence M.
Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Northrop directors, officers and employees currently
control at least 23% of the company's common stock, the
current proxy statement indicates. An employee savings plan
holds about a 16.4% stake, and directors and officers as a
group owned about 6.7% of the shares as of March 8.</p>
