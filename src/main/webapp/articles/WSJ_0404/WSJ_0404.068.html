	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar was mixed in late afternoon
dealings, but traders voiced little conviction about pushing
the currency in any direction.
   The lack of economic news and the meeting of the Group of
Seven industrial nations set for Saturday in Paris confined
the greenback to tight trading ranges, dealers said. There is
lingering fear that the G-7 will surprise the market with a
plan to defend the yen. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan,
Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While most traders said the likelihood is slim that the
G-7 will come up with measures to boost the yen, few
expressed a willingness to sell the yen for dollars on their
expectations.</p>
<p>Robert White, vice president and manager of corporate
trading at First Interstate of California, Los Angeles, said
nobody wants to buy the dollar now if the G-7 is going to
knock it down next week with intervention. The reasoning:
Intervention would give dealers a better rate at which to buy
dollars next week.</p>
<p>Traders showed more certainty about the mark's
relationship to the yen, nudging the West German currency to
another solid advance on confidence that the Bundesbank will
successfully manage the German monetary union while doubts
persist over Japanese monetary policy.</p>
<p>Speculation about results of the G-7 meeting also lifted
the mark against the yen. The West German currency gained
amid talk in the market that the U.S. and West Germany will
refuse to aid Japan in bolstering its currency, said John
McCarthy, chief foreign-exchange dealer at
Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank in New York.</p>
<p>Much of the greenback's gains against the yen came near
the end of New York trading, with one dealer attributing the
gains to another play in the mark-yen rate. Traders sold the
yen not only against the mark but against the dollar.</p>
<p>Mr. White of First Interstate said the U.S. currency's
fall through a key chart point at 1.6980 marks in the New
York morning set off more dollar selling. But there was no
follow-through, he said, adding that chartists' expectations
for a break out of the ranges have generally been dashed
recently.</p>
<p>In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at
1.6979 marks, down from 1.7009 marks late Monday, and at
159.79 yen, up from 158.95 yen. Sterling was at $1.6357, up
from $1.6348.</p>
<p>In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 159.62
yen, unchanged from the opening price but down from Tuesday's
Tokyo close of 158.95 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was
trading at around 1.6968 marks, up slightly from the opening
quote of 1.6965 marks but below Tuesday's Tokyo close of
1.7008 marks.</p>
<p>The dollar isn't expected to top 160 yen or stray far from
1.70 marks before the G-7 meeting. If nothing comes out of
the meeting, the U.S. unit will quickly climb to 165 yen, Mr.
White predicted.</p>
<p>Traders said a rebound by the Tokyo stock market Tuesday
and indications that the U.S.-Japanese trade talks in
Washington are making progress helped the yen during the day.
But other traders said the day's quiet trading was more
because of caution following the dollar's recent jump against
the yen.</p>
<p>Traders said the dollar should move between 157 and 160.50
yen during the week. One trader, while contending that 165
yen remains a long-term target, said the dollar should stay
between 155 yen to 160 yen for the next two to three weeks.</p>
<p>However, Katsumi Asako, chief corporate dealer with
Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo, said the dollar could still
move as high as 162.50 yen if the stock market posts further
sharp declines.</p>
<p>Traders said the Bank of Japan is believed to have sold
about $100 million Tuesday. Some speculated that the Japanese
central bank's intervention activities may be constrained by
the sharp drop in Japan's foreign reserves. The Finance
Ministry said Monday that Japan's foreign reserves posted
their biggest monthly drop ever in March, falling $6.95
billion. The Bank of Japan's heavy dollar sales during the
month are widely seen as the main factor behind the decline.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $375.30 an ounce, up $5.50.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold opened for trading at $374.95
an ounce.</p>
