independence, a delegation of Lithuanian officials met in
Moscow with a confidant of Gorbachev. While details of the
discussions weren't known, Lithuania's deputy prime minister
said the republic is prepared to compromise on anything
except independence, which the Soviet Union has declared
illegal. The Soviet legislature, meanwhile, approved a law
stipulating that a decision to secede must be taken by a
two-thirds majority of a republic's residents voting in a
referendum.</p>
