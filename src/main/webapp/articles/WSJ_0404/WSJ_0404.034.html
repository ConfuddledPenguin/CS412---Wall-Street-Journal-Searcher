	<p class="article-leader">PICKERINGTON, Ohio -- R.G. Barry Corp. said it halted
manufacturing operations at a factory in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico, because of excessive employee turnover.
   The producer of washable slippers and other comfort
footwear said it expects to incur costs of about $700,000 in
the closing, which affected about 200 employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We haven't been able to hire, train or retain enough
people to allow our plant to operate at a reasonable cost
level or near its capacity," said Gordon Zacks, chairman and
chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The company said it can meet its requirements at its other
facilities, including two plants in Mexico, one in China and
three in the U.S.</p>
