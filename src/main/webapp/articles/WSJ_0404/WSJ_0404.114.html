	<p class="article-leader">Xerox Corp. said it will take a first-quarter pretax
write-off of about $400 million in connection with its
investments in VMS Realty Partners, a Chicago real estate
concern.
   The write-off, Xerox's biggest ever, includes the
company's entire $106 million equity stake in VMS, more than
$250 million in notes, interest and credit, and a small
portion of $200 million in secured financing held by Xerox
Credit Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We intend to treat VMS, from an accounting viewpoint, as
a discontinued operation," a Xerox spokesman said. Asked if
Xerox considers the VMS shares worthless, he replied, "I
won't say that, but the fact that we're writing it off speaks
for itself."</p>
<p>Xerox said it will disclose the write-off's after-tax
impact when the company reports first-quarter results April
26. Xerox also indicated it will likely lose the revenue
stream generated by the VMS investments, which including
interest and equity revenue, amounted to $35 million in 1989,
the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Joel A. Stone, VMS chairman and chief executive officer,
wouldn't comment on the Xerox move. Leonard G. Levine,
president and chief executive officer of the eight
VMS-sponsored publicly traded funds, couldn't be reached. A
spokesman for the funds, which recently declared their
independence from VMS's control, said the funds remained in
work-out negotiations with VMS and therefore couldn't
comment.</p>
<p>Xerox, a Stamford, Conn., office equipment and financial
concern, said it made its decision after seeing the results
of an evaluation of VMS undertaken by VMS and its financial
advisers. The spokesman said Xerox doesn't anticipate any
further VMS-related write-offs, and analysts said yesterday's
announcement closed the book on an embarrassing matter for
Xerox.</p>
<p>"With this write-off, they're basically walking away from
the whole mess," said Alex Henderson of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "Most of the Street has already discounted
this, and there may actually be a sigh of relief that it's
out of the way."</p>
<p>Xerox made its announcement after the stock market closed.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Xerox closed at $55.375, unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday's news came one day after Xerox said Melvin
Howard will take early retirement May 1. Mr. Howard is the
vice chairman who heads Xerox Financial Services, the arm of
Xerox responsible for its VMS investments. Reached at his
Westport, Conn., home, Mr. Howard said that the two
announcements aren't related, and that he had retired to
pursue entrepreneurial interests, probably in the investment
field.</p>
<p>"In fact, I would probably have retired at the start of
the year, except I felt it was important to stay until {a VMS
creditors' meeting} yesterday."</p>
<p>But several analysts said the timing had more
significance. "Howard is obviously bearing the freight on
this one," said Ulric Weil, a Washington, D.C., analyst. "He
was in charge, and he had to pay the price."</p>
<p>VMS is a syndication firm that raised about $2.6 billion
from approximately 110,000 investors in limited partnerships
and real estate investment trusts, or REITs, from 1981 to
this past year. VMS's efforts at transforming itself into a
full-scale real estate firm with $9 billion in assets have
been called into question after a series of announcements by
the firm of liquidity problems and management shake-ups.</p>
<p>Scott G. Miller, an independent real estate analyst in
Houston who has followed VMS closely for several years, said
the news came "as no surprise."</p>
<p>"VMS is not now and never has been worth anything," Mr.
Miller said. "Any assets that they claim are so tied down in
over-financing that they have little or no value."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said he had warned Mr. Howard several times
about the riskiness of any investment in VMS beginning in
February 1987 when Xerox first disclosed its VMS stake.</p>
<p>"Xerox and the other big players were duped into thinking
that their back-end investment had some value. They chose to
ignore the syndicators' real goals: raising cash from limited
partners and reaping high front-end fees," Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, Mr. Howard responded, "I have no
comment on anything Mr. Miller has to say."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said that by not writing down its entire
investment, Xerox was engaging in "a political posture, a
face-saving exercise. They should just come clean and say,
`We were ripped off at day one and we were dumber than
hell.'"</p>
<p>Xerox's move should be a warning to individual investors
and to broker-dealers as well, Mr. Miller said. "They always
claimed a deep-pocket theory. The broker-dealers told
investors that Xerox would stand behind their products with
their fields of gold," Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. announced a major
management shake-up after lawsuits were filed against VMS and
Pru-Bache following VMS's disclosure of its troubles in
February.</p>
<p>"That pitch only works with people who think that
counterfeit money can be made real," according to Mr. Miller.
"Unfortunately, there were more than 100,000 such people when
it came to VMS."</p>
<p>VMS has retained Kenneth Leventhal & Co. as work-out
advisers and Kenneth Leventhal himself has taken a leading
role in analyzing VMS's value. In addition VMS is engaged in
negotiations with its creditors on "an ongoing basis"
according to Mr. Stone. VMS has defaulted or missed payments
on a number of mortgage loans and suspended payments to most
lenders, including its funds. But VMS executives continue to
say that the firm, a private partnership, will not go into
bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
<p>Xerox retains a 25% stake in the firm and a seat on its
executive committee. The other owners are Mr. Stone, Peter R.
Morris, the firm's founder, and Robert A. Van Kampen, a
Chicago area investor and entrepreneur.</p>
