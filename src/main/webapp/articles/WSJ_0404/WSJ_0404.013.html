	<p class="article-leader">SADDLE BROOK, N.J. -- Sealed Air Corp. said the government
lifted a temporary suspension on the company's ability to
obtain government contracts.
   The suspension had stemmed from a guilty plea late last
year by the maker of protective packaging to a 1986 violation
of a law controlling exports to Libya. The debarment
proceedings to which Sealed Air had been subject also have
ended, the company said.</p>
