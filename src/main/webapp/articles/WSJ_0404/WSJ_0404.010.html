	<p class="article-leader">LUXEMBOURG -- Consumer prices in the European Community
rose 0.5% in February, leaving the EC's average annual
inflation rate at 5.2%, the EC statistics agency Eurostat
reported.
   Eurostat said February's rise in prices in the EC was due
to substantial increases in West Germany and the Netherlands
(both 0.4%), Spain and Britain (both 0.6%), Italy (0.8%) and
Portugal (2.3%).</p>
