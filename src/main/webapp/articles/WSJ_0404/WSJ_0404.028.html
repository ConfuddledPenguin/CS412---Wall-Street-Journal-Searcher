	<p class="article-leader">MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. slashed prices
25% to 40% on older products in one line of workstations and
introduced some new models.
   The price cuts affected its DECstation and DECsystem
computers based on the Mips Computer Systems Inc. RISC
design. For example, the entry level DECstation 2100 was cut
to $5,950 from $7,950 and the DECsystem 5400 computer was cut
to $30,000 from $49,900.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Price cuts on older models frequently accompany
new-product introductions in the computer industry. However,
Russ Crabs, an analyst with Soundview Financial Group,
Stamford, Conn., said the sharp cuts were "a surprise
component" of Digital's new-product announcement. He said
Digital may be "making a pre-emptive move" to counter a
low-priced RISC computer expected from workstation leader Sun
Microsystems Inc. later this year.</p>
<p>Vicki Brown, who follows the workstation market for
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass., said that while
Digital has had lower-priced RISC workstations than Sun since
the DECstation's introduction in early 1989, they have been
slow sellers. With new models and an increasing amount of
software available, she predicted Digital will sell about
25,000 of the RISC systems this year compared with just 6,000
last year. She expects Sun to sell 100,000 of its
Sparcstation RISC systems this year.</p>
<p>Digital's new workstation line, the DECstation 5000, will
have a base price of $14,995. The workstation runs at 24
million instructions per second, almost as fast as the speed
claimed by International Business Machines Corp. for its
entry-level RS/6000 workstation. Digital's 5000 comes in four
models, depending on graphics capabilities, with the top
color model priced at $51,100.</p>
<p>Digital also said that in June it will introduce more
powerful members of the RISC-based multiuser 5800 family. The
two additional models will include three or four
microprocessors and run at speeds up to 62 million
instructions per second. With price cuts on the two existing
models, pricing for the 5800 series now runs from $75,000 to
$160,000.</p>
