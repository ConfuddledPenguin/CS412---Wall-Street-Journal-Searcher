	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Morton International Inc., in the latest move
to bolster its specialty chemical operations, said it will
begin manufacturing sealants for the aerospace and aircraft
industry.
   In the past Morton has simply supplied other manufacturers
with the polymer used in such sealants. In response to what
it calls growing demand, however, Morton said a new segment
of its Specialty Chemicals Group will now produce the
finished sealants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company "decided to use our technology and provide the
finished product," said a spokeswoman. The sealants are to be
jointly developed with the Chemetall G.m.b.H. unit of West
Germany's Metallgesellschaft AG.</p>
<p>Morton's specialty chemical division had sales of $322
million last year, but it recently acquired Whittaker Corp.'s
specialty chemical segment, which had sales in the latest
year of about $180 million.</p>
