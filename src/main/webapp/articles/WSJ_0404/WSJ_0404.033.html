	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French industrialists operating in the
competitive sector expect their capital spending to grow by
between 14% and 15% this year after an increase of about 11%
in 1989, the National Statistics Institute said.
   The state-run data-gathering body noted that after
adjustment for inflation, industrial investment would show an
increase of about 11%, compared with 7% in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It said the acceleration to a large extent reflects a
continuing strong investment trend in the automobile
industry, with car manufacturers racing to expand capacity.</p>
<p>French industrialists have indicated frequently over the
past year or so that they have been held back from producing
more because of insufficient capacity.</p>
