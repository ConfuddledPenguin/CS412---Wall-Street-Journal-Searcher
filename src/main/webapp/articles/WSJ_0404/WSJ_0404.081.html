	<p class="article-leader">ZEELAND, Mich. -- Herman Miller Inc. said it agreed to
acquire Meridian Inc. of Spring Lake, Mich., in a stock swap
valued at about $28.6 million.
   Herman Miller said it will acquire the closely held maker
of metal-case goods by exchanging 1,380,000 of its common
shares for all of Meridian's shares outstanding. The shares
to be issued will represent 5.4% of Herman Miller's common
stock after the acquisition, Herman Miller said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James H. Bloem, Herman Miller vice president and chief
financial officer, said the transaction will neither enhance
nor dilute the company's per-share earnings for the fiscal
year ending June 2. The Michigan office-furniture maker said
it expects to complete the transaction before May 23.
Completion is subject to regulatory approval.</p>
