	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Provigo Inc. named two people to succeed its
former chairman, president and chief executive officer,
Pierre Lortie, who left five months ago after the board
decided to sell the nonfood operations of the wholesale and
retail grocery concern.
   Bertin Nadeau, who has effective control of 51% of
Provigo's stock, was named chairman. He will share the chief
executive's post with Yvan Bussieres, who also was named
president.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Nadeau, 49 years old, controls Unigesco Inc., a
Montreal distribution concern. Unigesco holds 26% of Provigo
directly, and, through an agreement with another major
holder, votes an additional 25% of Provigo's shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Bussieres, 46, previously was president and chief
operating officer of a Provigo unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Nadeau said that within the newly created "office of
the chief executive," he will be responsible for the
company's overall direction and finances, while Mr. Bussieres
will concentrate on operations.</p>
<p>Provigo also posted a loss for the year ended Jan. 27, as
expected, but analysts said the results were even weaker than
anticipated. The fiscal 1990 deficit of 51.4 million Canadian
dollars (US$44 million), or 60 Canadian cents (51 U.S. cents)
a share, compares with year-earlier earnings of C$51.5
million, or 61 Canadian cents a share. The results for both
years include extraordinary charges and losses from
discontinued operations, including a C$60 million charge for
the disposal of Provigo's nonfood businesses in the latest
year.</p>
<p>Sales rose 15% to C$6.14 billion from C$5.35 billion.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Provigo shares
closed unchanged at C$9.25.</p>
