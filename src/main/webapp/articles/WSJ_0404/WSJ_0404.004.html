	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- London's two main financial-futures markets plan
to merge into a single entity, in the most significant
realignment of British securities exchanges since Big Bang,
the 1986 opening of London's markets to greater competition.
   In a joint statement, London's International Financial
Futures Exchange, known as Liffe, and London's Stock Exchange
said they "are actively examining a complete integration" of
Liffe and the stock exchange's equity-options market,
independent of the stock exchange. The proposed merger, which
follows nearly three years of fitful discussion, is aimed at
increasing trading and operating efficiency, as well as
fighting competition from growing futures markets in
Continental Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The combined exchange would be the largest single futures
and options market in Europe, with more than 33% of European
futures volume and nearly 5% of global trading flows.</p>
<p>The two markets said they have established a committee to
recommend how best to meld their organizations into a "single
autonomous management and governance on a single trading
floor." The panel, whose report is due by June 30, includes
senior executives from both markets. It will be chaired by
Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England. The
central bank has long advocated -- from behind the scenes --
such a merger to enhance London's position as Europe's
leading financial center.</p>
<p>London's fragmented markets face increasing competition
from futures markets in France, the Netherlands and West
Germany. Meanwhile, America's Chicago-centered futures and
options markets are boosting efforts to expand globally
through electronic-exchange initiatives. With the outlook for
increased use of derivative products, a more efficient London
market would ensure "a material enhancement" in Britain's
position, the exchanges said.</p>
<p>The decision marks a victory for Liffe, which has resisted
attempts to be absorbed into the stock exchange's
bureaucracy. Officials on both sides said the announcement
indicates that past differences and personality conflicts
have been set aside. "This is a very constructive move I hope
very much will succeed," Stock Exchange Chairman Andrew Hugh
Smith said in an interview.</p>
<p>The stock exchange apparently believes it has more to gain
from collaboration. While both bodies have long agreed on the
logic of a merger, discussions in the past have broken apart
over such issues as which body the exchange would operate
under, and who would run it. In the past 18 months, however,
volume has been largely stagnant or declined on the
exchange's traded options market, while it has surged on
Liffe, which primarily trades futures and options on
international currencies and government bonds.</p>
<p>Liffe has been more aggressive in improving technology and
trading procedures, traders say. In contrast, the stock
exchange, which has only a third of its members participating
in traded options, has paid less attention to derivative
products. And for trading firms, most of whom are members of
both exchanges, the separation has caused duplication of
systems and expenses. "Derivatives belong together," said
David Burton, Liffe chairman. "Our members want a coming
together."</p>
<p>There are still some thorny issues to be resolved. Among
the leading questions is the location of a combined trading
floor. Liffe has already announced plans to move eventually
from its current, overloaded floor in the Royal Exchange
building a block from the stock exchange. Mr. Burton said two
possibilities for a combined floor are at the stock exchange
itself and at a new site in the City, London's financial
district.</p>
<p>The stock exchange's old floor has been largely empty
since Big Bang, when electronic trading reforms drove
business into dealing rooms around the City. Indeed, on a
recent day, the only players there were a handful of options
traders.</p>
