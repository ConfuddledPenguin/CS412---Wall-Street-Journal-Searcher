	<p class="article-leader">On Oct. 30, 1985, Sylvia Seegrist walked into the
Springfield Mall in suburban Philadelphia and started to
shoot at random with a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle. Her
bullets hit 10 people, killing three of them. She was later
ruled criminally insane.
   This Valentine's Day, a Delaware County jury ruled that
Ms. Seegrist's crime was the fault of the shopping mall, and
that it was liable to the victims for the damages. While the
amount of damages was kept secret in an out-of-court
settlement, the plaintiffs' original demand was in the
millions of dollars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By what logic can a shopping mall be blamed for mass
murder by a madwoman? The answer says much about the current
state of tort law and the risks of retail business in
America.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs made several arguments. One was that the
mall should have had more than two unarmed guards on duty.
The security expert for the plaintiffs testified that if an
unarmed guard had been stationed continuously in the main
entrance to the mall, he could have deterred the madwoman
from shooting people. He also testified that the guards were
poorly trained and not systematically told that Ms. Seegrist
had previously made death threats at the mall.</p>
<p>More important, perhaps, was the psychiatric testimony.
The plaintiffs' psychiatrist testified that the mall should
have attempted to have Ms. Seegrist committed to a mental
institution. The basis of his claim was that Ms. Seegrist had
appeared in the McDonald's restaurant at the mall shortly
after the 1984 mass murder in San Diego by James Huberty,
muttering about what a good idea the San Diego crime was. She
said to no one in particular that the crime should be
repeated in Springfield and that she was just the one to do
it. She also pointed her fingers like a gun and went
"rat-tat-tat-tat." Then she paid for her coffee, sat down and
drank it.</p>
<p>Over the next year, she appeared several more times at the
mall. Each time she acted bizarrely, and several times more
she made threats. This was consistent with her 12 prior
commitments to mental hospitals, each of which was
progressively shorter. During one commitment in 1981, she
stabbed a hospital employee. Three years later, she joined
the Army. She didn't last long in the service, but after her
discharge she frequently wore fatigues and combat boots.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs' psychiatrist conceded that about 3% of the
adult population shows schizophrenic tendencies similar to
Ms. Seegrist's pre-shooting behavior. He also conceded that
the rate of violence among schizophrenics is no higher than
the rate of violence in the non-schizophrenic population.
Nonetheless, he thought Ms. Seegrist's behavior was
threatening enough to put the mall on notice that it should
seek to have her committed.</p>
<p>The defendant's psychiatrist, unlike the plaintiffs', had
worked on hundreds of civil commitments in Pennsylvania. He
testified that there was almost no chance that Ms. Seegrist
would have been committed merely for making threats. Even if
she had been committed, he said, she would have been released
very quickly, and been free again to shoot up the mall.</p>
<p>As a criminologist, I testified for the defense that the
threats gave no notice of the crime, citing my study of 110
specific threats of death in Milwaukee, many with
gun-pointing. Not one was followed by serious injury. Police
nationwide routinely encounter bizarre people making wild
threats without arresting them, since the threats are almost
always just talk.</p>
<p>The mall's attorney asked me about the crucial legal
question of "foreseeability," or whether a reasonable person
should have foreseen the occurrence of the crime. My research
showed that from 1976 to 1984, there was only about one crime
a year similar to this one in the entire U.S.: simultaneous
murder of three or more people by a stranger, not for
monetary gain, using a gun. Only seven people a year, on
average, die from such an offense. Fifteen people, on
average, die from planes falling out of the sky on them.
Lightning strikes some 80 people dead each year, and auto
accidents kill 50,000. The odds of the plaintiffs' dying in a
mass murder were about 1 in 30 million.</p>
<p>The annual odds of Ms. Seegrist committing the crime were
only 1 in 156 million, without considering her sex. The prior
rate of such crimes by women nationwide was zero. There also
had been no prior documented mass murder in a shopping
center. I told the jury that these odds were so low that no
reasonable person should have foreseen this occurring at the
mall.</p>
<p>Even if the crime had been foreseeable, my research showed
that the crime was impossible to prevent by any reasonable
standard of care. Police stations, courthouses and any
premises open to the public are vulnerable to exactly the
same kind of attack. The only way to have prevented a sudden
terrorist attack at the mall would have been to turn it into
an armed camp. The defense suggested that would be an
unreasonable standard of care.</p>
<p>The jury disagreed.</p>
