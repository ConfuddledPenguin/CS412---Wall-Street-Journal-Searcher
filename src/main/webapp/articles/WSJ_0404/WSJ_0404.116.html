	<h3>Your Money Matters: Behind Every Fund Stands a Manager -- for How Long?</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Whose record is it, anyway?
   That's the question investors should ask when mutual funds
start touting the virtues of their 10-year performance
records. Funds with good long-term track records are eager to
promote them. But a decade is a long time, often long enough
for several fund managers to come and go.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The current fund manager may not be the person who
produced the strong track record, as shareholders of the $13
billion Fidelity Magellan Fund are well aware. A decade ago,
Peter Lynch's anointed successor at Magellan, 32-year-old
Morris Smith, had only just graduated from college and still
had two years of business school ahead of him.</p>
<p>Right now, fund analysts say, investors need to be more
vigilant than ever in keeping tabs on who runs their mutual
funds.</p>
<p>"In the last 12 to 18 months, there's been a notable
acceleration in the rate of manager turnover," says Michael
Hirsch, chief investment officer at Republic National Bank of
New York. One reason: "There are a lot of rich mutual fund
management companies that can afford to pay up for talent.
The best way to differentiate yourself from the competition
is to have a star manager at your helm."</p>
<p>Peter Lynch's recent resignation from top-ranked Magellan
is the latest in a string of departures by leading fund
managers. Last year, two of the industry's star stock
pickers, Andrew Massie of Scudder Capital Growth and Gerald
Zukowski of Boston Co. Capital Appreciation, jumped ship. Mr.
Massie went to Counsellors Capital Appreciation and Mr.
Zukowski to Putnam Vista.</p>
<p>"In the vast majority of cases, you have to know who the
portfolio manager is," advises Mr. Hirsch. "The funds say,
`It's the firm's philosophy that counts, not the individual'.
Those are the same people who are out there bidding seven
figures for star managers."</p>
<p>Not all fund managers are equally important, however.
Rather, it depends on the way a fund is run. Among actively
managed funds, there are four basic styles of fund
management:</p>
<p>Star system. Peter Lynch is the star manager par
excellence. Heavily promoted by Fidelity Investments and long
feted by the media, Mr. Lynch's name is inseparable from that
of Magellan and its outstanding record.</p>
<p>But "{the good performance} wasn't just because of Lynch,"
retorts Mr. Lynch. "It was because I was working with an
outstanding group of people. The people who helped me are
still here."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, departing stars such as Mr. Lynch create a
marketing headache for fund groups, which typically respond
by boasting of the fabulous research department that lies
behind the star's success. (Fidelity hasn't decided whether
it will continue advertising Magellan's 10-year record.)</p>
<p>Ignore the boasting, say fund analysts. "If the star
leaves, the whole track record becomes invalid," argues
Kenneth Gregory of L/G No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco
newsletter.</p>
<p>To reduce the problems caused by fund manager turnover,
Mr. Gregory suggests investing in funds where the manager has
a significant ownership stake in the fund management company,
and thus is less likely to leave.</p>
<p>Top fund managers who fall into this category include
Acorn's Ralph Wanger, Gabelli Asset's Mario Gabelli, Mutual
Shares' Michael Price and Southeastern Asset Management Value
Trust's O. Mason Hawkins.</p>
<p>Multiple managers. At American Funds Group in Los Angeles,
a modified form of star system is used, with great success.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, six of the fund group's seven stock
funds beat Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The best of
these, $4.5 billion Washington Mutual Investors, returned
19.1% a year during the decade, after deducting the fund's
5.75% sales charge.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual's portfolio is divided into four
segments. Three segments are run by three individual stock
pickers, who each run their portion as a separate portfolio.
The newest of the three, Stephen Bepler, has been with the
fund since 1981. The fourth segment is run based on the picks
of 20 analysts.</p>
<p>Because the multiple-manager system works to reduce the
impact of a fund manager's departure and also seems to
produce above-average results, other fund groups have also
adopted the approach.</p>
<p>Vanguard Group already has switched two of its funds,
Windsor II and Explorer, to a modified form of multiple
management. Shareholders in a third Vanguard fund, Morgan
Growth, will vote this month to switch the fund from one to
three managers.</p>
<p>Committee. All major investment decisions at San
Francisco's Dodge & Cox Stock Fund are approved by a
committee of seven people, six of whom were on the committee
at the start of the 1980s.</p>
<p>"We haven't done this for insurance reasons -- because
we're afraid of people leaving," says John Gunn, the firm's
director of research. Rather, he reckons the committee system
reduces the likelihood of making a bad investment. "With the
management of money, the person who wins is the one who makes
the fewest mistakes over the course of time," he says.</p>
<p>None of Dodge & Cox's publicity-shy managers are well
known. That isn't the case at some other committee-run funds.
"Even if there is a group approach, it's difficult to know
whether one individual is more important than the others,"
says Mr. Gregory, who cites the examples of Brandywine and
Clipper, two no-load funds with excellent records.</p>
<p>The lead manager for Brandywine is Foster Friess, while
James Gipson is the key figure at Clipper. But both funds are
run by a group of stock pickers.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory says that if Mr. Friess or Mr. Gipson left,
that wouldn't necessarily mean shareholders should sell. "It
would be similar to when an analyst puts a `hold' on a
stock," he says. "I'd watch them and see what happens for a
few years."</p>
<p>Computer-driven funds. Twentieth Century's two oldest
funds, Select and Growth, rank just behind Magellan in terms
of 15-year performance. And while the fund group is closely
associated with its founder, James Stowers, analysts say
investors would be foolish to cash out their holdings if he
left the fund group.</p>
<p>Working from a data base of 7,200 companies, Twentieth
Century's seven stock funds invest in companies that have
both accelerating earnings and sales growth. The firm's
investment philosophy isn't just reflected in the thinking of
the five-member stock-picking team; it's also built into the
computerized stock selection system that they use.</p>
<p>"This system is designed so that it is much more powerful
than any one individual," contends Robert Puff, who together
with Mr. Stowers is a member of the fund group's
stock-picking team. "A large percentage of the time we are
following what the computer says. But it only happens after
we say, `Does this make sense, is this reasonable?'"</p>
