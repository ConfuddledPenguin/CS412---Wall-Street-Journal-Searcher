	<p class="article-leader">A committee of Eastern Airlines' unsecured creditors
rejected an offer of repayment of about 25 cents for every
dollar they're owed and voted to seek a bankruptcy court
trustee to run the beleaguered airline.
   In a strong expression of lost confidence in the airline
and its management, the 16-member committee unanimously
rebuffed a new Eastern repayment plan that would have
returned the equivalent of only five cents on the dollar in
immediate cash, or around $50 million. The plan would have
repaid another 20 cents or so on the dollar, or about $190
million, through two secured notes, according people familiar
with the group's action yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The unsecured creditors are owed roughly $1 billion.</p>
<p>Relations between Eastern and its creditors committee have
deteriorated steadily after Eastern last week announced it
couldn't meet terms of a settlement reached only a month
earlier. That agreement had called for repaying about 50
cents on the dollar, including $300 million in up-front cash.
Angered, creditors responded with a threat to seek
liquidation of the carrier if Texas Air Corp., Eastern's
parent, didn't take a bigger role. Texas Air said it couldn't
provide the backing sought.</p>
<p>In apparent response to those demands, Texas Air yesterday
did propose underwriting up to $25 million of Eastern's
future losses, people familiar with the action said. The
amount Texas Air agreed to cover, however, is far less than
what some creditors wanted.</p>
<p>It is unclear where yesterday's actions by the creditors
committee leave Eastern's year-old Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization case. The carrier is rolling up huge losses
and has consistently missed projections for the amount of
money its operations were supposed to generate. Lately,
Eastern has said revenue is being hurt because business
travelers are scared off by adverse publicity, including
liquidation talk.</p>
<p>In fact, however, creditors can't force a liquidation or
the naming of a trustee. They can only ask the court to take
such steps, and Eastern and Texas Air would almost certainly
resist.</p>
<p>Last night, an Eastern spokesman, in response to reports
of the creditors' committee actions, said the plan presented
by Eastern "serves the creditors far better than any
alternative transaction, including liquidation or sale of the
airline, both of which are exceedingly remote." He said he
couldn't divulge details, however.</p>
<p>The spokesman added that Eastern believes "there is no
legal or policy basis for the appointment of a trustee" to
operate the carrier, and raised the question of whether such
a call by creditors might be "a negotiating ploy."</p>
<p>If so, the vote to ask for a trustee, coming after
creditors' private meeting with Eastern and Texas Air
executives in New York, was a powerful statement of
frustration. Thirteen committee members voted to pursue
appointment of a trustee.</p>
<p>The creditors had until now rejected the notion of a
trustee to replace Eastern's managers and run the airline's
day-to-day operations. Eastern's unions, whose strike a year
ago triggered the bankruptcy filing, have long backed the
idea. Indeed, a union motion to appoint a trustee was
scheduled to be heard in bankruptcy court yesterday but was
postponed until May 9.</p>
<p>In effect, the creditors, weary from constant changes in
their repayment proposals, yesterday were saying enough is
enough, according to people familiar with their
deliberations. Last week, when creditors threatened to call
for liquidation or a trustee, they were declaring they wanted
the 50-cent plan agreed upon, and didn't care whether the
money came from Eastern or Texas Air, these people said. It's
understood the creditors took yesterday's 25-cent proposal as
a rejection of that demand. However, the call for a trustee
yesterday apparently contained no further reference to
liquidation.</p>
