	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Two brokerage firms, Midland Doherty Financial
Corp. and Walwyn Inc. said they agreed to merge and are
taking on a new partner in exchange for a cash injection.
   Under terms of the agreement, shareholders would exchange
each Midland Doherty share held for 1.75 shares in the
combined company. Walwyn shares would be exchanged on a
one-for-one basis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meantime, Mackenzie Financial Corp., a Toronto investment
management concern, said it would pay 19.6 million Canadian
dollars ($16.8 million) for 22% of the new company's shares,
making it the largest single shareholder. Mackenzie said its
purchase was for investment purposes.</p>
<p>The transactions are subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals. The companies said last month that they were
holding discussions about a possible merger.</p>
<p>Midland is 31%-owned by Union Enterprises Ltd., which is
controlled by Unicorp Canada Corp., a natural resources and
financial services concern. Toronto financiers Peter and
Edward Bronfman hold a 22% indirect stake in Unicorp through
their merchant bank and holding company, Hees International
Bancorp Inc.</p>
<p>Walwyn is 38%-owned by Toronto-based Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd., an insurance and financial-services holding
company.</p>
<p>After the merger, Fairfax will hold 19% of the combined
company's shares, Union Enterprises will own 10%, and the
rest will be publicly traded.</p>
<p>James Moir, president of Midland Doherty and chairman and
chief executive of its operating unit, Midland Capital Corp.,
said the merger would result in some layoffs, particularly
among supporting staff. Mr. Moir said he plans to leave the
company after the merger because of a "duplication of
management talent." He said he has no specific plans at the
moment.</p>
<p>The new company, whose name hasn't been disclosed, will be
headed by H.A. Arrell as chairman and chief executive
officer. Mr. Arrell is currently chairman and chief executive
of Walwyn.</p>
