	<p class="article-leader">A group that includes Bailey Financial Group Inc. and
Financial Securities Fund L.P. said it has offered to acquire
all stock outstanding of Durham Corp. for $37.50 a share.
   In a letter to Durham's chairman, the group said its offer
would provide $30 in cash and $7.50 in subordinated
debentures for each Durham common share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The letter was attached to a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Officials of Durham, an insurance and broadcasting concern
based in Raleigh, N.C., couldn't be reached for comment. The
company had 8.4 million common shares outstanding as of Dec.
31</p>
<p>Durham was quoted in over-the-counter trading yesterday at
$30.50 a share.</p>
<p>All aspects of the offer, including the possibility of a
higher, all-cash offer, are negotiable, the group said. It
stressed its desire to conduct a review of Durham, noting
that it could raise its offer if the information justifies
doing so.</p>
<p>The group said that its financial adviser, Stephens Inc.,
has demonstrated the group's financial ability to fund the
offer.</p>
<p>Bailey Financial and Financial Securities are part of a
shareholder group holding a 5.9% stake in Durham's common
stock, according to a previous SEC filing.</p>
