	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Seagull Energy Corp. said it plans to offer for
sale about 8.3 billion cubic feet of its proved domestic
natural gas reserves and 1.5 million barrels of oil reserves.
   Seagull said the sale, expected to be concluded by year
end, involves mature reserves acquired since late 1988 that
aren't strategic to the company's operations. The sale will
allow some operating economies and help fund continuing
exploration, Seagull said.</p>
