	<p class="article-leader">A PACT TO BUY an executive's home undermines a firm's
business deduction.
   Azar Nut Co. of El Paso reluctantly contracted to buy a
new executive's house for market value if it fired him. Two
years later, he was gone. Azar shelled out $285,000 for the
home and put it up for sale. But the best deal Azar could get
brought a $111,366 loss, which it deducted as an ordinary
business cost. The IRS objected, so Azar turned to the Tax
Court. The court's decision is a warning against such pacts,
says Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The IRS contended that the house was a capital asset
producing a capital loss not deductible from business income.
Azar argued that its expense was a form of employee
compensation and also satisfied a business need. But Judge
Drennen rejected this plea and applied a 1988 Supreme Court
ruling that assets are capital unless defined otherwise by
law. A house is a capital asset that produces capital gain or
loss, the judge held. He denied Azar's deduction.</p>
<p>Azar could have taken a compensation deduction if it had
simply reimbursed the ex-employee for a loss on his own sale
of the house, Willens says.</p>
<p>GET A RECEIPT for your return from the post office, many
advisers say.</p>
<p>The time is fast approaching when you must file your
return -- or a Form 4868 requesting an automatic four-month
extension of the due date (send a check for estimated tax
owed, too). One advantage of electronic filing over the mail
is immediate confirmation that the IRS got your return. If
you do rely on the post office, many preparers suggest using
certified mail, return receipt requested, to have some
evidence that you filed on time, even if it doesn't prove
what was inside the envelope.</p>
<p>James Stephenson of Miller Cooper & Co., CPAs in
Northbrook, Ill., says, "We request receipts even on returns
mailed well in advance of the deadline." Receipts from
private deliverers carry no weight with the IRS, he notes.
The IRS is neutral on the use of certified mail; one can
infer that it isn't keen on the idea. But it has post-office
workers at every return-processing center to handle requests
for receipts.</p>
<p>THE CUSTOMS SERVICE must clean up its records mess fast,
the GAO warns.</p>
<p>Customs has been under fire for accounting controls so lax
that they foster thefts and fraud. The General Accounting
Office says there has been "an almost total breakdown" of
controls for numbered documents that Customs agents at 300
entry ports use to record duties, taxes, and other receipts
of cash and checks. In fiscal 1989, these payments totaled
nearly $700 million. Yet Customs admits it couldn't account
for several million such documents in prior years.</p>
<p>The result is "an enormous potential for abuse and
cover-up," the GAO says. It recommends that Customs
immediately abandon the old forms, adopt new numbered forms,
and enforce stringent controls over the assignment of the
forms to and the use by Customs agents. Each form must be
traceable to an individual employee, the GAO asserts. Modern
technology could eliminate the paper documents, the GAO adds,
but it says technology alone can't solve the problems it
found in collection controls.</p>
<p>Last year, Customs got a new commissioner, Carol Hallett,
who recently announced an agency reorganization.</p>
<p>BASE-SALARY RANGES for top tax executives at manufacturers
with $1 billion to $5 billion in sales have mid-points
averaging $102,784, recruiter Ward Howell International found
in a survey; bonuses average 30%. For tax executives at
service concerns, the equivalent salary figure is $111,363,
and bonuses average 25%.</p>
<p>BATTERED FARMERS who get federal payments if disasters
damage crops or prevent planting may treat the payments as
insurance proceeds taxable in the following year when the
crops would have been sold. So say temporary IRS rules
published in T.D. 8289 and amplified in Notice 90-28.</p>
<p>IT VANISHED BY VAN: The movers sold her furniture when
Sandra Lynn Mallory of Crestwood, Mo., didn't pay their
storage bill. But that doesn't justify her theft-loss
deduction, the Tax Court ruled.</p>
<p>PASSIVE-ACTIVITY INVESTORS have a choice to make in filing
1989 returns.</p>
<p>Passive losses from rental real estate or businesses in
which you aren't active may be deducted only from passive
income or when you dispose of the activity. Now you may make
an irrevocable election on returns that may be favorable or
not, but should be considered, says Boston lawyer Forrest
Milder. The choice: whether to treat similar activities as
separate or combined.</p>
<p>Accumulated losses of a separate entity are deductible
when it is sold. But take a store treated as part of a larger
activity, a chain of stores: If you sell that store, its
losses won't be deductible until the whole chain is sold,
unless you elect now to treat each store separately. There
may be disadvantages in separation, though, such as
accounting complexities and costs. The election method for
real estate differs from that for other activities. And there
is no election for non-real-estate rental activities; each
must be treated separately.</p>
<p>Elections must be made with 1989 returns, even if you
don't plan any dispositions, Milder cautions.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: "Highlights of 1989 Tax Changes," Publication 553,
is available from the IRS. . . . The U.S. and Peru have
agreed to exchange tax information. . . . The IRS has delayed
to June 1 the deadline for comments on accuracy-related and
preparer penalties described in Notice 90-20.</p>
