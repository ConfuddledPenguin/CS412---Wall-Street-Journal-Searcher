	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Sen. Alan Dixon stood up during Senate
debate on amendments to the Clean Air Act last week and
complained: "No one here knows how much this bill will
ultimately cost business in America."
   The Illinois Democrat might have added that no one
precisely knows the positive effects of the bill, much less
how to put a dollar value on them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Strange as that sounds, Congress has spent far more time
debating costs and benefits than it did when it passed the
original Clean Air Act 20 years ago. "Back then, it was a
little unseemly to even ask," says Paul Portney, a former
Carter administration environmental official now at Resources
for the Future, a Washington think tank.</p>
<p>But legislation in the 1990s demands cost-benefit analysis
-- or at least the attempt. All the cost figures being tossed
around, including those in the accompanying chart, are
actually educated guesses that rely on assumptions about
technology, business behavior and science that are certain to
change over the next decade.</p>
<p>As spongy as the cost estimates are, they're much more
reliable than the best estimates of the benefits. Scientists
don't agree on how much harm is done by acid rain, for
instance, and they don't know how much long-term harm is
caused lungs by smog in Los Angeles. So it's impossible for
economists to assign dollar values to the benefits of
controlling or reversing the problem. And then there is the
always-tough question: How much is it worth to save one human
life?</p>
<p>By any measure, the bill that went before the Senate is
costly. The Bush administration figures it will cost about
$21.5 billion a year by 2005, when it's fully implemented.
That's about $90 a year for every current resident of the
U.S., or roughly the value of all the goods and services
produced in the United States in 1 1/2 days.</p>
<p>Some business groups say the cost will be far higher. The
administration itself warns that its cost could rise as much
as $10 billion a year if stricter auto-tailpipe controls in
the Senate bill are triggered in the year 2001. Some
environmental groups say the total cost is far less.</p>
<p>Mr. Portney, whose group tries to remain nonpartisan in
this debate, figures the cost at between $25 billion or $30
billion. He thinks the administration may be low-balling its
estimates to defend the compromise it reached with the
Senate. But he adds that costs are likely to fall because
industry will have an incentive to figure out cheaper ways to
meet the targets set in the bill.</p>
<p>"The administration tried very hard to make sure that
cost-minimizing methods were used to achieve cleaner air,"
says Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers. "This is a shift in environmental regulation from
the '70s, but there were a number of features, especially of
the original Senate bill, which blatantly disregarded any
sense of balancing the benefits of a healthier environment
with the cost of lost jobs and higher utility bills."</p>
<p>With the figures so rough, no one is taking a position on
the Clean Air bill based strictly on an objective weighing of
costs vs. benefits. Even economists who like such an approach
say they don't have enough information.</p>
<p>Although controversy persists about how much harm acid
rain is doing, the one element of the bill that draws the
most criticism from economists is the tougher restrictions it
would impose on release of toxic chemicals. "We could make a
much bigger dent in annual cancer mortality . . . if we spent
that money elsewhere," says Mr. Portney. "One example: radon
in people's homes."</p>
<p>In the end, he notes, politicians -- not economists -- may
be the best judges of what Americans are willing to pay for
cleaner air. "It could be that in economists' attempts to
estimate the benefits associated with these things, we don't
appreciate the high values that people attach to such things
as preserving human health, improving visibility and
protecting the ecosystem."</p>
