	<p class="article-leader">JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Mounting government pressure on
Indonesia's corporate groups to voluntarily divest as much as
25% of their equity to cooperatives is stirring anxiety and
confusion among business leaders.
   Executives say they are trying to comply with the spirit
of Jakarta's request, which President Suharto calls an
"appeal" for big business to share its prosperity. Many
businessmen are worried that the cooperative plan --
conceived and vigorously promoted by President Suharto --
could create business and political headaches, undercutting
confidence in Indonesia's surging economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the Indonesian constitution, cooperatives are
intended to be one of three pillars of the country's economy,
along with the government and private business. The 34,000
cooperatives are government-encouraged organizations designed
to pool savings from groups of farmers or company employees
and supply members with credit or low-cost essential goods.
But most of the cooperatives are short of cash, credibility
and capable management.</p>
<p>Suharto's initiative is intended to defuse growing social
tensions by giving the 27 million cooperative members a stake
in the country's economic gains. But his plan has been
criticized by economists and businessmen is impractical and
out of step with the government's economic-deregulation
policies.</p>
<p>The government has said the divestment plan won't apply to
foreigners.</p>
