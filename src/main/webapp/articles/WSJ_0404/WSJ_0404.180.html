	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A group of former Southmark Corp. employees said
it has received consents from a majority of the limited
partners of 16 Southmark partnerships to take over the
general partner role of those private partnerships.
   The Limited Partner Investor Monitoring Committee Inc.,
formed by former executives of the Southmark unit that sold
private limited partnerships a few years ago, has been
soliciting proxies from 33 private real estate partnerships,
most of which own health-care facilities. The New York-based
group said that so far, it has won enough votes to become the
general partner of partnerships that own 31 nursing homes and
retirement centers, three mini-warehouses and the Pittsburgh
Airport Holiday Inn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Southmark spokesman said that the troubled real estate
and thrift concern will evaluate the materials submitted by
the committee and "should we find everything to be in order,
we will acquiesce to the vote of our limited partners."</p>
<p>Currently, Southmark affiliates manage almost all the real
estate properties owned by the partnerships for a fee equal
to about 5% to 7.5% of the partnerships' revenue. The Limited
Partner committee said it plans to try to lower those fees to
seek lower-cost management services.</p>
<p>However, limited partners will pay a fee equal to 1.75% of
revenues to the committee to be the general partner; in most
cases, those partners already paid fees for a Southmark unit
to be the general partner when they purchased partnership
interests.</p>
<p>The Limited Partner committee also said that it plans to
file claims on behalf of limited partners in Southmark's
bankruptcy-law proceedings. The company is operating under
Chapter 11 protection from creditors while it tries to work
out a plan to pay its debts.</p>
