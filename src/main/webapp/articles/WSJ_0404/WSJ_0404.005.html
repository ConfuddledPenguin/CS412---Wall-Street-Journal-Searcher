	<p class="article-leader">BUCHAREST, Romania -- Picture the White House almost the
size of the Pentagon, clad inside and out with white marble,
and transported to the top of a man-made hill. Who would want
to live in it? What could be done with it?
   Romanians have just such a white elephant on their hands,
built but never finished by the executed dictator Nicolae
Ceaucescu, and now public property in fact.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As they stand in long lines to buy their meat and bread,
many Romanians ponder such questions. Mr. Ceaucescu's dream
-- the House of the Republic -- is, rather, a folly that cost
this poor country more than $1 billion over the past 10
years. Today it stands empty and unused, dominating downtown
Bucharest, a monument to megalomania. The new government
won't move into it. Nobody knows quite what to do with it.
Everybody has a suggestion.</p>
<p>It could be a gambling casino, a condominium, a bowling
alley, a thousand-screen multiplex movie theater, somebody's
corporate headquarters. Most likely, it will become a museum
or a university -- or the home of some international
organization.</p>
<p>Strangely, some Romanians feel a perverse attachment to
this absurdly luxurious structure built with their money and
the sweat of their brow while most people here were shivering
in dark, unheated housing. The palace was built by some
100,000 workers, many of them army conscripts forced to do
construction work. Traian Guiu, a stocky, balding
boilermaker, who with 10,000 others is touring the building,
is asked if he is angry.</p>
<p>"Angry? I'm proud. Romanians built this. It's wonderful."</p>
<p>Should the edifice be sold?</p>
<p>"No, no, no. We should never sell this building, to
foreigners or anybody else," he says. "It's crazy, crazy," he
adds, making a circle round his ear with his index finger and
pausing on a grand marble staircase. "But we suffered for
this. It's ours."</p>
<p>A crowd tarrying in the unfinished entrance hall marvels
at the beauty and the scale of it all.</p>
<p>"Isn't this nicer than the White House?" asks a
gap-toothed woman in a babushka.</p>
<p>"Well, it's bigger than the White House," replies an
American visitor.</p>
<p>"See," says the woman, turning to her daughter, also in a
babushka. "Bigger than the White House."</p>
<p>Bigger by far. It is also three times the size of
Versailles. The huge, boxy white Romanian structure is 466
feet high, counting the flagpole on the roof. The building's
12 stories enclose 106 million cubic feet of air; floor space
is more than 3,875,000 square feet. The Romanian architects
responsible swear it is the biggest nonskyscraper office
building in the world, after the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The building features two mammoth receiving halls, one of
which, at 230 feet in length and 98 feet in width (cum
59-foot ceiling), can accommodate all of Bucharest's
beautiful people and then some. A 5,382-square-foot boardroom
has a round table that takes up most of it. One of the
building's two amphitheaters seating thousands is illuminated
by the second biggest chandelier in Europe, with 980
lightbulbs in all. There are 60 large salons, 540 spacious
offices and perhaps a thousand other rooms -- nobody knows
for sure how many, an architect says.</p>
<p>The Ceaucescu palace has a bomb shelter 300 feet
underground, and gracious his-and-hers suites in which a
person of importance might retire, fitted with cherrywood
paneling and parquet floors. (The Ceaucescus weren't actually
going to live in this building. They had a nice house to
themselves elsewhere in Bucharest.) The best of Romania is
here: gray-streaked marble from Ruschita, elegant chandeliers
from Medias, mosaic tile floors and hand-woven carpets from
throughout the nation. The exterior, officially said to be in
"neo-classical French style," looks more like something
designed by a committee of Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini.</p>
<p>French newspapers say two Japanese companies want to buy
the building, but Japan's embassy here admits to knowing
nothing of that. The names Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch
have been mentioned by Romanians as potential buyers, but
both men disclaim any interest.</p>
<p>Officials of the new Romanian government see the palace as
one of many headaches bequeathed to the people by the late
Ceaucescus. (Interestingly, the army, which helped build the
palace, also tried and executed the Ceaucescus.) Theodor
Stolojan, the first deputy finance minister, feels the need
of cash to balance his budget but figures the palace would be
politically impossible to sell. "Hey," he says. "I'm kind of
proud of the building, too. But I could have been just as
proud of something a little smaller, like maybe one-tenth the
size."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mr. Stolojan, informal opinion polls and
entries in guest books placed at the exit indicate that
virtually everybody thinks the building should be completed
at state expense, which will take another 6 billion lei
(about $290,million) and maybe four more years. Romanians
also think it should be kept in public hands. But what
exactly to do with it nobody seems to know.</p>
<p>"Give it to Unesco," suggests schoolgirl Elena Ungureanu.</p>
<p>"Make it a museum of Romanian folk art," says storekeeper
Turcan Valenti.</p>
<p>"Open an international museum of kitsch," proposes an
anonymous German visitor.</p>
<p>Suggestions, serious and otherwise, include making it a
hotel or an arts complex like the Georges Pompidou Center in
Paris; a museum of the atrocities of Stalinism, with exhibits
from all over Eastern Europe; a Dracula theme-park; a site
for industrial trade shows; an institute for advanced
political studies.</p>
<p>Whatever becomes of it, the House of the People, as it is
known now that the dictator is dead and gone, will
nevertheless remain Romania's most visible monument to the
excesses of Mr. Ceaucescu, who ruled the country for 24
years. During the past dozen years he became increasingly
interested in imperial grandeur, which is technically rather
odd for a Marxist-Leninist. The building was to be a home
away from home to the Ceaucescus, Nicolae and Elena, who died
together before a firing squad on Christmas Day. The
building, rather large for a married couple with grown
children, would also have housed various Communist Party
institutions.</p>
<p>Even as his country struggled in increasing economic and
political isolation, Mr. Ceaucescu visited his monument every
Saturday afternoon to check on how things were going. It was
a visit the architects dreaded.</p>
<p>"We had to redo that stairway six times," says builder
Mikal Covrig. "First, he wanted two columns on either side.
The next week, it was one column on each side. Two weeks
later, we had to take a meter and a half off the front step,
with pneumatic drills. Each time, we had to redesign the
whole thing." In other rooms, he adds, Mr. Ceaucescu would
take a sudden dislike to a central supporting column, and the
harried architects would have a week in which to figure out
how to get rid of the offending pillar without causing the
ceiling to collapse.</p>
<p>He didn't stop there. Mr. Ceaucescu ordered built a grand
boulevard, 6.5 feet wider than the Champs Elysees, stretching
southward from the main entrance of the palace, with
apartment buildings and shops of similar style on either
side. To make room for all this, one-fourth of old Bucharest
was razed.</p>
<p>Originally the apartments were to be given to apparachiks
and, Romanians assume, to members of Mr. Ceaucescu's feared
secret police, the Securitate. Long finished, the apartments
have never been occupied. Recently, the new provisional
government started giving them to citizens whose homes were
damaged in December's bloody revolution, and people are
moving in.</p>
<p>"It was all a Pharaonic dream," says Bucharest history
professor Stefan Andreescu, having just completed a tour of
the palace. "No Romanian king ever had such a grand dream or
built such a castle. Only the last king, the crazy one."</p>
