	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. said it will resume
sales of its Jeep vehicles in Saudi Arabia for the first time
in 25 years.
   The No. 3 auto maker said the move is coming because Arab
nations last year removed Jeeps from the list of products
they are boycotting. Chrysler also said it hopes to increase
sales of all its products in the Arab market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first step was naming United Arab Motors Co. as the
distributor for Jeep and Dodge vehicles in Saudi Arabia. The
distribution concern, owned by Aggad Investment Co., will
construct three Saudi dealerships in Riyadh, Damman and
Jeddah. Chrysler, which said it expects to sell about 1,200
to 1,500 vehicles a year there, may soon sign distribution
agreements in other Middle East nations.</p>
