	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate's clean-air bill would require
use of cleaner-burning gasoline in the nation's nine
smoggiest cities, but it could benefit rural America as much
as urban America.
   The reason is corn: The special gasoline requirement could
vastly increase use of ethanol, a corn-distilled alcohol
that's long been a favorite fuel of farm-state lawmakers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Oil-state senators charge that the provision is nothing
less than a gift for corn growers and Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co., the nation's largest producer of ethanol. "It is piracy
aimed at benefiting one industry relative to another," says
Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas), who is running for re-election
this fall, "and its objective has absolutely nothing to do
with clean air."</p>
<p>ADM's chairman and chief executive officer, Dwayne
Andreas, is a longtime friend and contributor to Senate GOP
leader Robert Dole of Kansas, a key backer of the provision.
And ADM's political action committee has given $232,900 to
congressional candidates since 1987, including some to Sen.

<p>The battle over the cleaner-fuel amendment is one of many
that pit one commercial interest against another. As with any
piece of major legislation, many of the skirmishes fought on
the Senate floor and in the Capitol's backrooms over the past
two months have had as much to do with who would profit and
who would lose than with cleaning America's air.</p>
<p>For instance, the Senate bill also includes a provision to
help the dirtiest coal-fired Midwestern power plants with
their high cleanup costs. In another provision, independent
coke producers, championed by such lawmakers as Sen. Howell
Heflin (D., Ala.), won a 30-year exemption from the threat of
mandatory shutdown for failing to reduce cancer risks to
nearby neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Growers of corn and other crops also would benefit from an
amendment, added at the behest of farm-state lawmakers, that
would give special treatment to ammonia, one of the most
common pollutants released into the atmosphere but an
important ingredient in widely used fertilizers.</p>
<p>Proponents of the cleaner-fuel provision say the big oil
companies simply don't want to make the investment required
to produce the reformulated gasoline or face the competition
from independent refineries that already produce gas using
ethanol. "Industry opposition is generated solely by their
desire to maintain their profitable monopoly on the gasoline
market, even at the expense of the health of the American
public," says Sen. Thomas Daschle (D., S.D.), the provision's
prime sponsor.</p>
<p>The cleaner-gasoline provision is but the latest chapter
in Congress' love affair with ethanol, which has flourished
thanks in large part to federal tax subsidies and import
tariffs promoted by such farm-state lawmakers as Sens.
Daschle and Dole.</p>
<p>Decatur, Ill.-based ADM, the world's biggest
commodities-processing company, dominates the domestic
ethanol market and is a major presence in Washington too. Mr.
Andreas, his relatives and ADM's political action committee
have contributed $76,000 to Sen. Dole's political efforts,
and the Archer-Daniels-Midland Foundation also has given
$160,000 to the Dole Foundation, a charitable organization
set up by the Kansas Republican in 1984. Since 1987, Mr.
Andreas personally gave $33,500 to various candidates.</p>
<p>"I do not have anything against ADM," says Sen. Don
Nickles (R., Okla.), who opposes the provision. "But that is
where most of the benefits are going to go -- perhaps more of
the benefits will go to them than the corn farmers."</p>
<p>ADM didn't take a position on the amendment, according to
a company spokesman.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Sen. Dole says the lawmaker's support for
the cleaner-fuel amendment "has nothing to do with Dwayne
Andreas," adding: "This amendment addresses the bottom-line
concerns of senators not only in farm states but all over:
How do you make gasoline less toxic?"</p>
<p>The provision sets forth a recipe for the reformulated
gasoline that would have to be sold in the dirtiest cities by
1994: no more than one quarter cancer-causing chemicals
called aromatics, no more than 1% benzene and an oxygen
content of at least 2.7%.</p>
<p>The big oil companies and their allies say that last
direction virtually mandates the use of ethanol. Sen. John
Breaux (D., La.), a member of the Senate Environment
Committee, derides the provision as "clearly a
let's-buy-more-corn proposal."</p>
<p>But aides to Sen. Daschle say that other additives, such
as methanol derived from natural gas, could satisfy the
requirements.</p>
<p>The cleaner-fuel provision is backed by such environmental
groups as the National Clean Air Coalition and the Sierra
Club and by the Citizen/Labor Energy Coalition, a
consumer-based public interest group.</p>
<p>Both sides agree that the provision would add to the cost
of fuel, though they're far apart on the question of how
much. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, claims
the additional cost could be as much as 25 cents a gallon.
Mr. Daschle, citing figures from a private industry
consulting group, said the additional cost would be only
between one cent and three cents a gallon.</p>
<p>The Congressional Research Service estimates the added
cost to be 10 cents-to-15 cents a gallon, or about $25
billion to $50 billion. Under certain circumstances, though,
the research service said the cost could be as high as $100
billion.</p>
<p>The Bush administration says the provision could add
billions of dollars to the measure's cost, but allows that
the reduction in toxic emissions from automobile exhaust
could also yield benefits on which it's hard to put a price
tag.</p>
