	<p class="article-leader">Boeing Co. said it is investigating an apparent case of
industrial sabotage, after a jetliner in the final stages of
production failed certain tests because of what the
Seattle-based company described as "highly irregular" wire
cuts.
   The problem at the aerospace company's Renton, Wash.,
production facility was discovered March 20, after the test
failure involving a 737-400 twin-engine plane. The severed
wires were buried inside a thick bundle of wires feeding a
power system, Boeing said. A spokesman said Boeing suspects
the wires may have been cut by an employee: "Everybody on
site is an employee. So that would be a conclusion that one
could draw."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Boeing said its internal investigators are providing
information about the incident to the Federal Aviation
Administration. Boeing had an industrial sabotage case about
20 years ago, the spokesman said. In recent months, rumors of
sabotage at the company's Everett, Wash., plant were
investigated and found to be untrue, he said.</p>
