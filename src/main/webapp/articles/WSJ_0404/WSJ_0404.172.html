	<p class="article-leader">E.C. Garcia & Co., a private real-estate development
concern in Tucson, Ariz., said it filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The company has attracted attention in recent months
because of its ties to Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of
Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., the parent of
Lincoln Savings & Loan Association. Lincoln, based in Irvine,
Calif., was seized by federal regulators a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ernest C. Garcia II, the real-estate concern's principal
owner, said the filing would make it easier to deal with
creditors, mostly "financial institutions that have been
taken over by the government."</p>
<p>Garcia & Co. has liabilities of about $35 million and will
file an estimate of its assets within 15 days, Mr. Garcia
said. The company owns and manages about 3,600 apartments, he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Garcia said: "We became grossly over-leveraged" after
borrowing money from Lincoln Savings in 1987 to repurchase an
80% stake in the company from Tucson Electric Power Co.</p>
