million newly issued units at 30.56 cents per unit, and said
the amount would be paid April 30 to unitholders of record

share of common stock, one-fiftieth of a new 12 1/2%
subordinated debenture due 2005, and a special cash payment

Angeles investment management concern, said that the initial
cash payment covers the period between March 3 and April 15.</p>
