	<p class="article-leader">THREAT TO WORLD HEALTH</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An estimated 500 million people will die from smoking in
the next 25 years, according to a World Health Organization
study released at the World Conference on Tobacco and Health
in Perth, Australia.</p>
<p>WHO statistician Alan Lopez and Richard Peto, an epidemics
expert at Britain's Oxford University, said their study
indicated smoking would be the No. 1 cause of death in the
world by the turn of the century. "Today there will be 8,000
deaths a day from smoking, but when the kids reach middle age
there will be something like 28,000 deaths a day," Mr. Peto
told the conference.</p>
<p>If present patterns continued, 200 million people under
the age of 20 and 300 million adults will die of smoking by
2015, Mr. Peto said, adding: "These figures are at the low
end of estimates."</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the forecast deaths in the 1990s will occur
in wealthy nations, the study said, but developing nations
will probably experience 70% of all world deaths from smoking
by 2025.</p>
<p>INVESTING IN AFRICA</p>
<p>Africa is a better bet for private U.S. investment than
Eastern Europe, Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African
Development Bank, told a news conference in New York. He
conceded that Eastern Europe has great political leverage for
aid because of the West's need to consolidate the East's
shift away from the Communist bloc. However, he said, "We are
more ready to talk of free-enterprise than Eastern Europe. To
adjust our mentality to the free market will be easier."</p>
<p>VENDING-MACHINE BEEF</p>
<p>A joint venture between Japanese and U.S. meat dealers
will sell beef imported from the U.S. in freezer-equipped
vending machines. "Our aim is to supply imported beef at a
cheaper price to consumers by reducing the costs of
distribution-related personnel," said Naoki Sakai, a
spokesman for Japan's Jackson Co. Jackson and Hamilton Meat
Co., a subsidiary of Beef America of Omaha, Neb., set up the
venture last month, Mr. Sakai said. Under the venture,
seasoned beef for steak and sukiyaki will be processed in the
U.S. before being imported in frozen vacuum packages for sale
in 1,000 vending machines throughout Japan.</p>
<p>EAST GERMANY LOOKS WEST</p>
<p>East Germany plans to open its petroleum market to Western
oil companies as part of efforts to rebuild its economy.
Klaus Eichner, director of the state-run Minol company, which
has a monopoly on fuel distribution, told the ADN news agency
that plans being made "would allow Western oil companies to
supply the domestic market." East Germany has traditionally
imported almost all of its petroleum from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>CURBING THAI SPECULATION</p>
<p>Thailand's Finance Ministry urged commercial banks to
reduce lending to speculative luxury projects. Finance
Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said banks must lend less for such
projects as condominiums and golf courses and should
concentrate on infrastructure and development projects.
Commercial-bank officials said Mr. Pramual aimed to slow the
surge of speculative investment in the booming stock exchange
and real-estate market and curb inflation.</p>
<p>ROTTERDAM TAKES ACTION</p>
<p>Harbor inspectors in Rotterdam are sealing discharge
outlets on vessels carrying harmful chemicals in an effort to
halt illegal underwater dumping in the world's largest port,
the Port Authority announced. Port Authority spokesman Rob
Wilken said, "We know that the dumping occurs regularly, but
it is very hard to check." He added that he believed the move
was the first such preventive measure by any major port.</p>
<p>THE SCOURGE OF RWANDA</p>
<p>Up to 30% of Rwandans living in the capital city of Kigali
and aged between 18 and 45 are infected with the virus that
causes AIDS, according to one of the country's leading
doctors.</p>
<p>Henri Taelman, the head of medical services at Kigali's
main hospital, said in a report that the total number of
infected people in the central African country had almost
doubled in four years. The report said 25% to 30% of the
sexually active population of Kigali, where 157,000 people
live, carry the AIDS virus. This compares with 18% in 1986.</p>
<p>In the countryside, where most of Rwanda's six million
people live, the rate was between 2% and 3% but increasing.</p>
<p>Dr. Taelman said the capital's main hospital treated more
than 4,600 AIDS patients last year -- half of all its
patients. He said drugs to treat AIDS were too expensive for
Rwanda and that the hospital could only try to ease the
suffering of AIDS patients before they died.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Two farmers from the Chinese province of Sichuan were
executed for selling the skins of giant pandas, China's Legal
Daily reported. Only about 1,000 giant pandas survive in
Sichuan and neighboring Tibet, and the Chinese government has
banned hunting of the species. . . . Chai Ling, one of the
top student leaders of last year's pro-democracy movement in
Beijing, appeared on Hong Kong television yesterday to
announce her escape to the West after 10 months as a fugitive
in China. Ms. Chai and her husband are believed to be in
France.</p>
