	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were largely unchanged in the week
ended yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs (generally, $500
to $10,000) at 18 banks surveyed by Banxquote Money Markets,
a New York information service, were flat or up only
slightly. The average yield on a one-year consumer CD was
7.93%, while five-year consumer CDs offered 8.15%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There wasn't any significant change in the
foreign-exchange market, or in domestic interest rates that
would have any dramatic affect on the CD market," said
Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote.</p>
<p>Average yields on small CDs sold by leading broker dealers
were up slightly. The average yield for a one-year
broker-sold CD was 8.19%. The only significant increase was
in the two-year brokered CD average. The rise, however,
resulted from the high rate of 8.75% offered by Shearson
Lehman Hutton.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields on most large-denomination CDs,
which typically require minimum deposits of $90,000 or more,
were unchanged in the shorter-term maturities, and up only
slightly in the longer maturities.</p>
