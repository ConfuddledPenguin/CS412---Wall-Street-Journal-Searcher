	<p class="article-leader">Com Systems Inc. said it completed the issue and sale of
preferred stock and subordinated debentures valued at $22
million to OmniCorp International B.V., which owns 57% of the
company's stock on a fully diluted basis.
   The troubled Van Nuys, Calif., telecommunications firm
said it would use part of the proceeds to acquire TMC
Communications of Santa Barbara, a regional
telecommunications firm, for about $13 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Com Systems said that it issued 4.5 million shares of a
new, Series C cumulative convertible preferred stock for $9
million to OmniCorp, which paid for the stock by canceling a
$9 million bridge loan with Com Systems. In 1988, Com Systems
reported a net loss of $5.8 million. Com Systems said it also
sold $13 million in aggregate principal amount of its
five-year, 11 1/2% convertible subordinated debentures to
OmniCorp, an affiliate of the Swiss conglomerate OmniCorp
Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>In addition, Com Systems said it named Sandra Styles, 42
years old, as the first of three OmniCorp designees to its
seven-member board. The company said that Stephen Olson, 47,
Richard Hillman, 47, and Sol Gerber, 77, resigned from the
board.</p>
