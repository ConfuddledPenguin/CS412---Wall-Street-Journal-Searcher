	<p class="article-leader">New Hampshire Savings Bank Corp. revised its
fourth-quarter loss to $32.7 million, or $5.31 a share, from
the previously reported $18.9 million, or $3.07 a share, and
said it expects its auditors to raise questions about its
ability to continue as a going concern.
   The Concord bank holding company -- one of many in New
England to be battered by the region's slumping real estate
market -- has been advised by its independent accountants
that their 1989 year-end report will express "reservations
about the prospects of the company," a spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New Hampshire Savings added that it expects to report a
loss for its first quarter.</p>
<p>The company added that it is not currently in compliance
with regulatory minimum capital requirements. As of Dec. 31,
the parent company had a primary capital ratio of 5.87% and
and its principal affiliate, New Hampshire Savings Bank, had
a ratio of 3.94%. The regulatory requirement for each is 6%.</p>
