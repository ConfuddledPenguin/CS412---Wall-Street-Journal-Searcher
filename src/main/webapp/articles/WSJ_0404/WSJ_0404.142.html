	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department said it found nearly
11,000 child-labor violations in its three-day nationwide
sweep last month.
   The total is considerably higher than the 7,000 violations
estimated by department officials the morning after the
enforcement blitz ended. The estimate of total fines for the
violations grew to $2.9 million from the $1.8 million figure
given last month, said William Brooks, assistant secretary
for the Employment Standards Administration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department released the first segment of names of the
employers cited for violations, covering those for
investigations completed so far. That list covered 172 cases,
about 10% of the 1,750 businesses where the agency said
violations were found in the sweep. The alleged violators
included restaurants either franchised or owned by well-known
fast-food and pizza chains.</p>
<p>The violations involve youths 14 through 17 years old,
either working more hours or later at night than allowed
during school weeks or working illegally in hazardous jobs.</p>
<p>Fines weren't assessed for many of the citations. But
where fines were proposed, they went as high as $29,050, for
a grocery store in Moore, Okla. The citations involved mostly
small fines, often less than $1,000.</p>
