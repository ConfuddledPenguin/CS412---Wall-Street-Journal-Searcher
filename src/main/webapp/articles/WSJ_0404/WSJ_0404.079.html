	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- MBP Acquisition Corp., an investment group
that includes Playtex Family Products Corp., agreed to
acquire cosmetics maker Maybelline for $300 million.
   Maybelline's parent, pharmaceutical maker Schering-Plough
Corp., announced plans last December to sell its cosmetics
unit in order to focus on its more profitable prescription
and over-the-counter drug businesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But no major corporate suitors emerged, and the current
cash offer, which amounts to about one times Maybelline's
1989 sales, is far less than analysts had originally expected
the maker of the No. 2 brand of mass-market cosmetics to
fetch. "They're getting it cheap," said Allan Mottus, a
cosmetics industry consultant.</p>
<p>Last September, consumer products concern Procter & Gamble
Co. announced plans to acquire Noxell Corp. in a stock swap
valued at $1.3 billion, or about 2.5 times Noxell's annual
sales. Noxell makes Maybelline's top rival Cover Girl
cosmetics, the No. 1 mass-market brand.</p>
<p>"I would say it's a good price, but a fair price" said
Hercules Sotos, vice chairman of Playtex, of the Maybelline
bid. A Schering-Plough spokesman also called the price fair,
and added that the pharmaceutical maker had never predicted
Maybelline's selling price.</p>
<p>MBP Acquisition is a newly formed group that includes
Playtex Family Products, which markets such consumer goods as
Playtex tampons and the Jhirmack and La Coupe brands of
shampoos; Thomas H. Lee Co., a leveraged buy-out firm based
in Boston, and members of Playtex and Maybelline managements.</p>
<p>Playtex Family Products, based in Stamford, Conn., was
formed in 1988 after Playtex Holdings Inc. was sold to a
management group and divided into two companies. Playtex
Holdings' other businesses became Playtex Apparel Inc., which
makes bras, girdles and other apparel.</p>
<p>Maybelline's management is expected to remain in place
after the transaction is completed, though the acquisition
doesn't mark Playtex's first venture into the image-oriented
world of cosmetics. The company had previously owned the Max
Factor, Almay and Halston cosmetics business, which it sold
to Revlon Group Inc. in 1986.</p>
<p>Drug industry analysts, who had applauded the announced
sale of the cosmetics unit, seemed to view the move
favorably. "Their {Schering-Plough's} future earnings will be
more predictable," said Hemant K. Shah, an independent
analyst with Hemant K. Shah & Co. "Maybelline has always been
an uncertain factor in Schering-Plough's earnings."</p>
<p>Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Schering-Plough's shares closed at $81.125, up 62.5
cents, on volume of 213,400 shares.</p>
