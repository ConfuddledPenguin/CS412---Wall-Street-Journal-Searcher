	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Cominco Ltd.'s controlling
shareholder said it plans an offer to acquire the balance of
Cominco's affiliate, Pine Point Mines Ltd., for 50 Canadian
dollars (US$42.81) a share, or about C$126 million (US$107.9
million).
   Closely held Nunachiaq Inc., which owns more than 40% of
Cominco, a mining concern, said it entered a related lock-up
agreement with Sprott Securities Ltd. of Toronto, under which
Sprott plans to tender about 1.82 million Pine Point shares
to the proposed bid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Pine Point
shares jumped C$4.75, to close at C$48.25.</p>
<p>Pine Point, which owns 45% of the Polaris lead and zinc
mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, has about 4.6 million
shares outstanding, of which Cominco owns about 2.1 million.</p>
<p>Vancouver-based Teck Corp., which owns 50% of Nunachiaq,
said in January it was considering making an offer for Pine
Point's minority-held shares, but it subsequently backed off.
Teck didn't disclose a proposed bid, though it said it
considered the offer after a broker it wouldn't identify
approached Teck about buying a large block of Pine Point
shares.</p>
<p>Metallgesellschaft AG of West Germany and M.I.M. Holdings
Ltd. of Australia, both large mining concerns, also hold
interests in Nunachiaq.</p>
<p>Nunachiaq said the bid will be mailed to Pine Point
holders when certain legal documents are completed. The bid
is conditional on Nunachiaq's acquiring at least 90% of Pine
Point's shares outstanding, other than those held by Cominco,
the company said.</p>
