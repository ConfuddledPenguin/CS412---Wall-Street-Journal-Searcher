	<p class="article-leader">Hartmarx Corp. reported a 75% drop in earnings for the
fiscal first quarter, which it blamed on a slowdown in both
the wholesale and retail menswear business.
   The Chicago maker of men's suits and other apparel also
said fall orders for its manufacturing operations were down
7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lower wholesale shipments, slimmer retail profit margins
and higher interest expenses combined to cut earnings to $2.4
million, or 12 cents a share, compared with $9.8 million, or
50 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Acquisitions boosted sales for the latest quarter to a
record $342.1 million, up from $327.4 million. But retail
sales in comparable businesses declined 2% during the most
recent quarter, which ended Feb. 28, Hartmarx said.</p>
<p>Harvey A. Weinberg, chairman and chief executive officer,
blamed results on a very competitive retail market that
dogged the company in fiscal 1989 and has spread to the
wholesale side. But he said March retail sales were up 10%
overall and up 4% in comparable locations. Hartmarx operates
more than 500 stores.</p>
