	<p class="article-leader">In the past two weeks, reports have come out of Washington
and Mexico City about new free trade talks, possibly opening
the way to a North American common market. These reports have
renewed the debate within Mexico about whether the country is
prepared to make a clean break from its protectionist
policies of the past.
   In the wake of this controversy, Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari met Monday with David Asman of the
Journal's editorial page. The interview, in English, was held
at Los Pinos, the presidential residence. Excerpts follow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Foreign Investment:</p>
<p>WSJ: Are foreign investors responding to the new,
liberalized foreign-investment law?</p>
<p>President Salinas: After we changed the law last May, in
one semester we got the investment we expected in one year.
But yes, we would like to see more foreign investment.</p>
<p>I believe that a trade relationship with the U.S. and
Canada on a more certain horizon would give foreign investors
in Mexico an additional stimulus to come. It would provide
them with a guaranteed access to each of these markets.</p>
<p>We have been very specific on what we want on trade with
the U.S. We've been walking on a very clear line, which is:
Mexico has opened unilaterally its economy for foreign trade.
And we haven't received the reciprocity which we believe we
are open to. That's why I am emphasizing with the U.S. and
Canada, with Europe and Japan, rules that would allow
permanent access to the markets.</p>
<p>WSJ: Do the Mexican people support a further opening of
trade relations with the U.S. and Canada?</p>
<p>President Salinas: Up to now, the opening of the economy
has meant lower prices for Mexicans. So now they know that by
opening the economy, we literally have forced domestic
producers with tradable goods to have prices equivalent to
international prices. This -- along with the macroeconomic
changes we have installed -- has helped us very much to
reduce inflation from almost 200% in 1987 to less than 20%
last year.</p>
<p>If with the opening of the economy Mexicans find out that
there are more job opportunities, that the economy is
growing, that inflation is kept down, then, yes, I'm sure
they will continue supporting the opening of the economy. If,
on the other hand, we open the economy and do not get
reciprocity in other markets -- and therefore our economy is
not able to export and not able to grow at high enough rates
-- then I'm sure public opinion will be adverse, and the
public will say, "Let's go back to the past -- to the time of
a closed economy."</p>
<p>On Migration:</p>
<p>Many Mexicans are crossing the border because they don't
find jobs in Mexico. But many others are crossing the border
because the U.S. economy demands this labor. For the first
group, I want to create jobs in Mexico. For the second group,
I want their labor rights and human rights protected in the
U.S.</p>
<p>The Simpson-Mazzoli bill was against economic realities.
The economy has shown that the reality is demanding this
manpower. On the other hand, I would prefer them to remain in
Mexico -- all of them. Why? Because they are courageous to
take the risk to travel that far; they are energetic and
young.</p>
<p>On Mexico's Tax Policy:</p>
<p>WSJ: Have you gained revenue by lowering rates and
broadening the tax base?</p>
<p>President Salinas: Yes, we have. On the one hand we made
tax rates competitive on international levels. I believe in
the U.S. the corporate rate is 35%; in Mexico it's 36%.</p>
<p>We have also broadened the base: 20% of GNP was tax-exempt
in Mexico. Imagine the loopholes. Farming was tax-exempt. So
you used to find industrialists who owned a farm and all the
profits went to the farm, which was tax exempt, and the
industry was in the red. And intellectual rights were
tax-exempt. So you could find businessmen who designed a logo
and charged a million dollars for the copyright. So we
broadened the base and the revenue is growing.</p>
<p>On Mexican Agriculture:</p>
<p>WSJ: By almost all accounts, the "ejido" system in Mexico
-- the system of strictly monitored communal farming -- is
not an effective system for feeding the people of Mexico.
There are deficits in basic foods here that shouldn't be.
What about the idea of changing the structure of agriculture
in Mexico to make the country more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>President Salinas: We are changing it. The problem is that
50 years ago, with 25 million people, you could have this
structure. But today, with almost 85 million, we must improve
the efficiency of the ejido (even though the ejido will
remain as a system of property and social relations). With
plots of one acre or half an acre, we will not be able to
have the productivity we need. At the same time, we are
giving guarantees to private owners in the rural areas so
that they can invest and take the risks knowing that their
rights will be protected. We are also strengthening relations
between the private farmers and the ejido workers.</p>
<p>We have to provide alternatives of work for the peasants
who cannot live off the land. But giving individual titles to
ejido workers has not been contemplated.</p>
<p>On the Internal Credit Market:</p>
<p>WSJ: Mexico's banks were nationalized in 1982. But is
there going to be an easier access to credit through private
institutions?</p>
<p>President Salinas: Yes, there is. We've been stimulating
regional groups to create their financial organizations so
that they can participate more in the financial system. The
stock exchange is almost totally privately owned. And now the
insurance companies that are publicly owned are being sold to
private enterprises. So we are opening new fields of
participation in credit to the private sector, and fields
that were previously opened are being expanded.</p>
<p>On Privatization:</p>
<p>WSJ: Privatization is getting increasingly complicated as
more and more state-run companies are put on the market
world-wide; there are now as many as 15 national telephone
companies for sale. Is this becoming a difficult component of
your privatization efforts?</p>
<p>President Salinas: It is. But nevertheless, we are
privatizing companies that are profitable.</p>
<p>Take the case of the telephone company. This year we will
show profits of $1 billion. We want to be sure that we have a
sale that will maximize profits. At the same time we want to
be sure that the new owners will have the capacity to expand
the company. And although the new owners will have the one
company, with the cellular phones, there will be competition
in that field. The new company will have the obligation to
connect the cellular connections to its main system.</p>
<p>The privatization process is welcomed in two senses.
First, (it) involves the workers in the companies. I
announced the privatization of the phone company in the union
hall. And the workers put it to a vote. It was the only
decision they had ever taken that passed unanimously; 50,000
workers voted in favor of privatization. They were asking for
better wages and the permanence of their positions, and I
told them that the only way to achieve these things was for
the company to expand. But the government cannot expand the
company, because of budget restraints. And they understood.
Besides, they will share in the ownership of the company;
they will participate in the capital ownership.</p>
<p>Also, the money we get from privatization is being
channeled into a program called "solidarity." It's answering
demands in slums, Indian communities and rural villages for
water, paving the roads, electricity, health centers, better
schools, etc. So now the Mexican people know that
privatization means improvement in their daily living. So, I
am not printing money to solve social problems. Thus, it is
not a populistic program. It's a truly popular program in the
sense that you answer social demands with real resources --
not those artificially created by the central bank. That's
how you can match the purpose of keeping public-sector
deficits down and at the same time answering social demands
of the population.</p>
<p>On Relations With Latin America:</p>
<p>We are strengthening our relations with the rest of Latin
America. Recently I went to Chile and Ecuador to emphasize
this relationship. We also are renewing our economic
relations with Chile. The minister of foreign relations of
Argentina said recently that every gain Mexico gets in
relation to the U.S. means the strengthening of all of Latin
America.</p>
<p>WSJ: Will Mexico continue to provide oil to Nicaragua on
the same terms as it did with the Sandinista regime?</p>
<p>President Salinas: I would say we will renew our original
policy with Nicaragua. We certainly will be ready to help to
contribute to restore the Nicaraguan economy. They have a
huge debt with Mexico, and we are looking for ways to help
them overcome this burden.</p>
<p>Europe's Economic Integration:</p>
<p>WSJ: In your recent travels to Europe, did you see the
economic integration of Europe as something the Western
Hemisphere should fear or welcome as it affects our wealth
and trade?</p>
<p>President Salinas: The changes in Eastern Europe
introduced two new elements that were not present before:
First, the unification of Germany, which we certainly
welcome; it's the right of the people to decide. This will
create really massive economic changes.</p>
<p>Second, the changes in Eastern Europe will provide the
people of Western Europe with a tremendous pool of skilled
labor and cheap labor. So the competitiveness of Europe will
improve tremendously. This is something that you do not see
in the U.S./Canadian situation.</p>
<p>We must have the capacity to penetrate those markets
efficiently. It's going to be tremendously formidable. We
better be prepared. The sooner, the better.</p>
