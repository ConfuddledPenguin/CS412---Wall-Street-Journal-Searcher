	<p class="article-leader">Not many law schools are located in converted
department-store buildings, but nothing could be more perfect
for Henry Manne. He's selling law students and their
prospective employers on the idea that lawyers should know
something about economics and markets. Armed with this
notion, the entrepreneurial law dean has propelled George
Mason Law School out of obscurity toward the top ranks.
   He's been dean since 1986 of this once-sleepy and mediocre
outpost of the Virginia state university system, located on a
commercial strip in Arlington across the river from
Washington, D.C. Mr. Manne recently snared Robert Bork to
begin teaching this fall, joining federal appeals Judge
Douglas Ginsburg. A recent survey by U.S. News of legal
academics picked George Mason as the top up-and-coming law
school. The number of applicants has tripled to 3,300, for
200 places.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Manne came to George Mason with an unusual background.
He pioneered an idea as radical in 1965 as it is commonplace
now. The traditional law reviews didn't understand his
article "Mergers and the Market for Corporate Control," which
was instead published in the Journal of Political Economy.
The article foresaw the Wall Street of the 1980s by
introducing the idea of takeovers as an excellent way for
stockholders to replace managers who don't maximize share
price. He also is known for criticizing "inside trading" laws
as overly vague.</p>
<p>Mr. Manne is a leading scholar of the law and economics
school begun at the University of Chicago Law School when he
was a student there in the early 1950s, and that includes
most prominently federal appeals court Judge Richard Posner.
Scholars of this school apply economics to legal issues as
diverse as product liability, incentives to litigate and
separation of powers. Mr. Manne took the job partly because
he could recruit most of the faculty. George Mason now has
the highest concentration of economics-oriented law scholars,
half of the 29 full-time professors.</p>
<p>Law and economics may be most valuable for helping judges
understand the effects of legal rules. A classic application
was explained in 1947 by Learned Hand, a federal judge in New
York. He became the Hammurabi of law and economics with a
court opinion that included the "Hand Formula" for when to
assess liability for negligence: only if the loss caused by
the accident, multiplied by the probability of the accident
occurring, is more than the cost of precautions the defendant
could have taken to avoid the accident. This may sound overly
formalistic, but following it would have prevented today's
deep-pocket-picking rules finding liability regardless of
who, if anyone, was at fault.</p>
<p>There were some bumps along the way to a more high-powered
George Mason. "When I first came there was terror in this
place," Mr. Manne recalls. "One rumor was that we were going
to drop all the law courses and all the law students had to
major in economics." He had to buy out the contracts of
several professors. He sent two professors to earn economics
Ph.D.s.</p>
<p>Mr. Manne says that in his second year, a student
complained about law professors who kept putting numbers on
the blackboard. Mr. Manne lectured her on the importance of
concepts such as present value and opportunity cost. He
decided to offer a course the school calls "Quantitative
Methods for Lawyers," which includes everything from basic
supply-and-demand ideas to regression analysis and the
Capital Asset Pricing Model. The course became mandatory when
law firms began asking for students who'd taken it.</p>
<p>"I just think it is irresponsible to have law students
graduate not knowing that winning $50,000 for a client over
20 years is not the same as $1 million now," Mr. Manne says.
These days discrimination and product-liability cases require
some knowledge of statistics. It's hard to follow takeover
law without finance theory.</p>
<p>Mr. Manne is careful to emphasize that George Mason is not
a conservative law school. Steven Ross, the liberal lawyer
for the House of Representatives, will join Mr. Bork as
part-time constitutional law teachers. Also, "There is
nothing more absurd than saying that law and economics is
ideological," Mr. Manne says. "We just give students the
economic tools they need." Of course, Mr. Manne knows that
the idea of applying concepts such as limited resources and
cost-benefit analysis is radical indeed in a legal world of
multi-million dollar punitive damages and activist judges
rewriting private contracts.</p>
<p>He has unique experience teaching economics as a neutral
analytic tool. For more than 15 years his Law and Economics
Center, now at George Mason, has run intensive study programs
for federal judges taught by leading economists such as
Milton Friedman. By now some 350 federal judges -- more than
40% of the total -- have taken these courses.</p>
<p>Mr. Manne cites an opinion by Philadelphia federal Judge
Edward Becker in an antitrust case, Zenith v. Matsushita
Electric. Judge Becker, a graduate of a Manne course, used
close economic reasoning to deny admission of supposed expert
testimony on predatory pricing. He wrote, "We have
encountered economists of the caliber of (the expert witness)
in their academic milieu, and, knowing their fetish for
rigorous analysis, cannot conceive of them . . . seriously
positing conclusions based upon (this) kind of evidence."</p>
<p>Along with emphasizing law and economics, Mr. Manne
decided to do something about a perennial problem at law
schools. Several studies have proposed that law school be
reduced to two years because the third year usually is a
mishmash of elective courses. As Mr. Manne says, "Out of the
current system you get such exotica as `Icelandic Sagas' and
`Legal Systems in Bangladesh,' where no two courses have any
relationship to another." He didn't mention it, but you also
get highly political courses that don't have much to do with
law at all, such as the crypto-Marxist Critical Legal
Studies.</p>
<p>So he created a three-year system in which students can
instead concentrate in legal specialties. Beginning with the
current class, students can take an integrated set of courses
in corporate and securities law, banking and
financial-services law or patent law. About one-third of the
students choose one of these tracks. The courses include
"Insolvency & Reorganization of Financial Services Firms" and
"Corporate Procedure & Litigation II."</p>
<p>It's fitting that Mr. Bork should pick George Mason to
resume law teaching. He made his early reputation with a book
that shook antitrust law by applying economic concepts to
show that big is not necessarily bad. Mr. Bork says he
accepted Mr. Manne's offer because "George Mason is a rapidly
improving place. Henry Manne is producing the law school to
watch."</p>
<p>Another thriving law school may not be what this country
needs most, but at least George Mason hopes to train lawyers
who understand the law in its biggest picture. If Mr. Manne
succeeds, his insistence that lawyers understand economics
could inspire a happy revolution in the development of our
laws.</p>
