	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Charity perhaps is in the eye of the
beholder, as Occidental Petroleum Corp. is discovering.
   The Los Angeles-based oil concern's $95 million plan for a
museum to house an art collection long linked with Chairman
Armand Hammer has run into resistance from shareholders,
including some of its largest, who argue that the museum is
more a pet scheme of the chairman's than an effort to
engender goodwill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Delaware Court of Chancery will hear arguments today
whether it should approve a proposed settlement of
shareholder lawsuits objecting to the museum, now under
construction in Los Angeles. If approved, the prospective
settlement, which is being sought by one plaintiffs group but
is opposed by others, would settle all the litigation.</p>
<p>But rather than put the matter to rest, the proposed
settlement seems to have rekindled stockholder ire.</p>
<p>In a 40-page brief, the California Public Employees'
Retirement System, holder of about two million shares of
Occidental, blasted the proposed pact "a cosmetic gesture"
that "does nothing to resolve the claims of waste" directed
at the museum.</p>
<p>On the other end of the shareholder scale, Richard and
Dorothy Vanderveld, holders of 100 shares, complained in a
letter to Maurice Hartnett, vice chancellor of the Delaware
court, that "the museum project provides no discernible
benefit to Occidental shareholders."</p>
<p>For its part, a special committee of Occidental's
directors, which approved outlays for the museum, argues that
the "rare and extremely valuable collection of art" will
provide extraordinary goodwill for the company. Dr. Hammer
and others familiar with the collection, which includes works
by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Rubens, and Leonardo da Vinci,
estimate its value at between $300 million and $400 million,
although some experts dispute that appraisal.</p>
<p>Ironically, the controversy over Dr. Hammer's efforts to
secure the collection's future has turned up troubling
questions about its past. Though ties between the company's
money and Dr. Hammer's art have long been obscured, court
documents show that Occidental financed a variety of
acquisitions and donations generally credited to Dr. Hammer,
including a contribution of more than $5 million to buy a
notebook of drawings and scientific writings by Leonardo da
Vinci that is one of the crown jewels of the collection.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a letter filed with the court, the estate of
Dr. Hammer's late wife, Frances Hammer, claimed ownership of
"a substantial interest" in the art assigned to the museum by
Dr. Hammer. The letter from lawyers for Robert Weiss,
executor of the estate, disputes certain disclaimers that
Mrs. Hammer apparently signed before her death on Dec. 16.</p>
<p>The proposed settlement calls for, among other things, a
$60 million cap on museum construction costs, a limit on
future company donations to Hammer-related charities, and a
provision that Occidental will receive 50% of the profits if
the museum should ever sell the company's headquarters, which
are being donated to it in the future.</p>
<p>The settlement includes $1.4 million in fees plus expenses
for plaintiffs' lawyers involved in the pact, which was
struck with one set of litigants in the case, a purported
class action titled Sullivan vs. Occidental Petroleum Corp.</p>
<p>Opposition to the settlement has been led by Alan R. Kahn,
a New York investment adviser who on behalf of a client
launched a purported class-action lawsuit last May, nine days
before the essentially similar Sullivan action was filed. Mr.
Kahn had declined to be a part of the Sullivan settlement
which, if approved, would forestall the Kahn case and future
actions.</p>
<p>Within weeks of filing in the Sullivan case, a proposed
settlement emerged for that case that included the $1.4
million fee -- a proposal that prompted a toughly worded
opinion from Vice Chancellor Hartnett when he rejected an
effort by Mr. Kahn to halt the settlement talks.</p>
<p>The vice chancellor at that time criticized that
settlement pact, which is almost identical to the one being
considered today. He at that time questioned "the lack of any
substantial benefit to the stockholders" and said it left
substantial doubts about "the egocentric nature of Dr.
Hammer's objections" to donating his collection to the Los
Angeles County Museum, where he had long promised to donate
his paintings. Dr. Hammer reneged on that promise in 1988 and
announced that, instead, a museum would be built with his
name and Occidental's money.</p>
<p>Rather than await a court decision in the case, Occidental
has proceeded with construction of the museum, which is an
integral part of its headquarters building in the upscale Los
Angeles suburb of Westwood. The company declined to comment
on the case.</p>
<p>In one of a number of letters from institutional holders,
Boston-based Batterymarch Financial Management, holder of
about two million Occidental shares, objected that the
proposed settlement "preserves and perpetuates the power of
the board" and urged that a shareholder vote be held on the
matter instead.</p>
