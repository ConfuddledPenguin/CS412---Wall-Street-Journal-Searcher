	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFIELD, N.J. -- Prime Motor Inns Inc. said per-share
earnings for the third quarter ended March 31 are expected to
be "substantially" below a year earlier.
   The owner, operator, and manager of hotels said the
decline was due to continued softness in hotel occupancy and
rates, as well as lack of property sales or development fee
income in the quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the quarter ended March 31, 1989, Prime had net income
of $18.8 million, or 55 cents a share, on revenue of $99.9
million.</p>
<p>Caroline S. Levy, Shearson Lehman Hutton
restaurant-lodging analyst, said earnings for the quarter
were being estimated recently at about 20 cents a share.
However, she declined to put an estimate on the earnings in
view of the announcement yesterday that Prime would put
properties of Servico Inc. into escrow.</p>
<p>"We don't know how it all works out," Ms. Levy said. "But
operating earnings are down as are margins on the sale of
assets. The trends of the lodging industry are also working
against Prime. Lodging room rates and room occupancy are
under pressure."</p>
<p>Prime said it had taken into escrow deeds and other
documents relating to properties of Servico, under the terms
of its $74 million loan to FCD Hospitality Inc. In 1989,
Prime loaned FCD money to acquire Servico. The announcement
appeared to indicate that Prime may take control of the
properties under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Prime owns, operates or manages 139 hotels with 20,500
rooms nationwide. It is also the franchiser for Howard
Johnson, Rodeway Inns International, and operates the U.S.
Ramada franchise system, which totals 1,100 properties with
150,000 rooms.</p>
