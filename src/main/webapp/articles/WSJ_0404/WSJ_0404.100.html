	<p class="article-leader">The Pentagon lifted the veil a bit on its F-117A Stealth
fighter-bomber, disclosing among other details that over nine
years it cost a total of $6.26 billion to acquire its 59
radar-evading Lockheed Corp. warplanes.
   That means the planes cost $106 million apiece, making
them far and away the nation's most expensive fighter-bomber.
The last F-117 is scheduled to be delivered later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The additional tidbits of information about the F-117s,
which have flown under cover of government secrecy since
1983, had been expected for many months. In fact, while
additional disclosures were being considered in December, the
U.S. invaded Panama, and the Defense Department disclosed
that two F-117s had dropped 2,000-pound bombs near a
Panamanian army barracks in support of one airborne assault.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Pentagon said six Stealth fighters in all
had been sent to Panama, although only two were called on to
attack targets. That mission, it said, emphasized the plane's
primary role as a precision night attack aircraft. The bombs
were meant to confuse, but not to kill, Panamanian soldiers
that U.S. paratroopers were attempting to capture.</p>
<p>Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said the
single-seat F-117 fighter has a 43-foot wingspan, is 65 feet
long and weighs 52,500 pounds. He declined to discuss the
range or the firepower of the twin-engine, subsonic plane,
which has curvy, composite surfaces that absorb and distort
radar beams. Many of the F-117A's parts were borrowed from
other aircraft, he said, including flight controls similar to
those on the Air Force's F-16 and General Electric Co. F-404
engines akin to those powering the Navy's F-18.</p>
<p>A new eight-minute film of the Stealth fighter in flight
also was released. Previously, only one hazy photograph and
drawings based on that shot had been made public. A showing
of the plane for reporters at the F-117's Nevada home, Nellis
Air Force Base, also was scheduled for April 21.</p>
<p>The existence of the F-117 was officially acknowledged for
the first time in November 1988, a few weeks before the Air
Force and Northrop Corp. held a "roll-out" ceremony for the
B-2 Stealth bomber. The newer B-2s, projected to cost more
than $500 million each for the full 132-plane fleet
envisioned by the Air Force, have been under serious attack
lately in Congress. Critics believe that in addition to being
overly expensive, it has a penetrating bomber role that may
be unnecessary in light of competing cruise missile
technology and the winding down of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Critics of defense spending also have suggested that
release of information about the F-117 seems geared to help
the cause of the bomber program by showing that a
stealth-technology aircraft already is part of the arsenal.</p>
<p>While the F-117's per-plane cost is extremely steep, some
analysts note that the total includes an unusually high $2
billion in development costs for the advanced-technology jet,
and other unusual costs including a sophisticated
mission-support computer. What the industry calls the
"flyaway cost," the price of production once development is
out of the way, was given as $42.6 million a plane.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams said that both the Air Force and Navy have
development plans for larger, faster and more sophisticated
stealth fighter-bombers, called the Advanced Tactical Fighter
and the Advanced Tactical Aircraft. While these planes will
also have radar-evading capabilities, their design will be
different from the F-117, he said.</p>
<p>Lockheed, which long has been lobbying to release more
information on the F-117, said it couldn't give any more
detail than the Pentagon disclosed. The planes, three of
which have been lost in crashes, were developed under a 1978
contract at the Lockheed "Skunk Works" aircraft development
operation that also produced the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes.</p>
<p>Company officials in the past have said that public
appreciation of the F-117 could help the company in its
competition with Northrop for the Air Force ATF contract. Mr.
Williams said that the F-117 acquisition process had been
streamlined to reduce costs and speed development of the
new-technology aircraft and that the plane's first flight
took place only 31 months after a go-ahead on full
development was given. He declined to comment, however, on
Lockheed's motives for wanting more F-117 information public.</p>
<p>The F-117s are based at the Tonopah Test Range Airfield at
Nellis, where the Pentagon said 2,650 military personnel are
assigned to the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing, to which the
planes are assigned.</p>
