	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- General Development Corp., a troubled Florida
developer, said it is closing its homesite sales operations
world-wide and firing 1,100 full-time and part-time sales and
administrative workers.
   On Monday, cash-hungry General Development said it
couldn't complete negotiations for a $60 million credit
facility, leaving it unable to pay more than $10 million in
property taxes due last Sunday. As a result, General
Development said it was considering all options, including a
filing for federal bankruptcy-law protection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Development tumbled $1.25 a share, to close at $2.75.</p>
<p>General Development has been trying to reverse liquidity
problems resulting from its recent legal troubles. Last
month, the company pleaded guilty to one felony count of
conspiracy in a plea bargain to settle charges that it
defrauded some 10,000 homebuyers by charging inflated prices
based on improper appraisals.</p>
<p>In recent months, General Development laid off 500
workers. The latest cutback will reduce the number of workers
to about 3,400. General Development said it hopes to
introduce a new homesite business in the future, but for the
time being, the operation's "cost of generating sales . . .
no longer makes economic sense."</p>
