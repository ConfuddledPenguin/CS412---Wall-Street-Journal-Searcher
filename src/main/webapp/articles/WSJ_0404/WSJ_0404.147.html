	<p class="article-leader">McDonald's Corp., responding to increased concerns about
cholesterol and fat in its foods, plans to change the way it
cooks its french fries and whips up shakes.
   The company said last night it is testing an all-vegetable
oil mixture and eliminating beef tallow from its frying
process. The oil-only method soon will be used in nearly 500
stores, and if successful could be expanded quickly, the
chain said. Currently, its fries are cooked in a mixture of
oil and tallow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>McDonald's also said its 8,000 domestic restaurants soon
will be reformulating its shakes with a low-fat mix. "We
thought it was a healthier product," said Richard G.
Starmann, a senior vice president.</p>
<p>The company disclosed the changes as it braced for
customer reaction to full-page advertisements attacking
McDonald's on nutritional grounds. The ads, which appear in
this and other major newspapers today, charge McDonald's and
other unnamed fast-food restaurants with "the poisoning of
America" because of the cholesterol and fat content in their
fare.</p>
<p>McDonald's termed the ad "reckless" and misleading. "I'm
really angry," said Edward H. Rensi, president and chief
operating officer of McDonald's USA. "It's irresponsible to
mislead and scare the public regarding these very important
issues." He said the company has been a leader in the
restaurant industry in disseminating nutritional information,
adding that booklets analyzing the content of various menu
items are available at most McDonald's outlets.</p>
<p>The ads were placed and paid for by Phil Sokolof, of
Omaha, Neb., who is identified in the ad as president of the
National Heart Savers Association.</p>
<p>Apparently singling out McDonald's because of its dominant
market share, the ads said the chain's popular two-patty Big
Mac hamburger contained 21.5% fat.</p>
<p>"That's not true," Mr. Starmann said after seeing the ad.
He said McDonald's uses beef graded as "lean" by the
Department of Agriculture. "That means it has less fat than
most ground beef -- 17%-19.5% fat."</p>
<p>He also took issue with the advertisement's claim that a
Big Mac and fries contain 25 grams of saturated fat, saying
that, depending on the size of the fries serving, the
combination contains between 15 grams and 19 grams of fat.
The advertisement calls on McDonald's "and all fast-food
restaurants to reduce the fat content of their hamburger meat
by 10% as their contribution toward lowering cholesterol
levels for Americans."</p>
<p>Mr. Starmann said McDonald's had not been contacted by Mr.
Sokolof, and was "very much surprised" by the ad. Previous
advertisements by Mr. Sokolof have criticized the cholesterol
and saturated fat levels of cookies, cereals, candies, TV
dinners and other foods. In apparent reaction to the ads, a
number of manufacturers have modified their ingredients to
reduce cholesterol and fat content.</p>
<p>McDonald's test of cooking fries in vegetable oil
apparently was coincidental with Mr. Sokolof's latest attack.
"We've had a long history of responding to our customers'
concerns about nutrition," Mr. Starmann said.</p>
<p>In 1986, for example, the chain began cooking its chicken,
fish and fruit pies in vegetable shortening he described as
cholesterol-free. "We've recently removed the chicken skin
from the Chicken McNuggets. Years ago we went to 2% low-fat
milk and skim milk. We don't even serve whole milk any more."</p>
<p>McDonald's soon will introduce a low-fat frozen yogurt as
well as a fruit sorbet in its stores, Mr. Starmann said.</p>
