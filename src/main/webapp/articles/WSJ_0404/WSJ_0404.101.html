	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- International Cablecasting Technologies Inc.
and Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said they will develop a new
product to deliver compact-disk quality sound to cable-TV
subscribers.
   The new service, CD/27: The Digital Music Network, is
scheduled to be unveiled this fall and will feature 27
commercial-free music formats uninterrupted by disk jockeys.
It will be available to cable systems as part of subscription
packages, and the companies estimated the monthly price --
including rental of a tuner -- at between $7 and $8.95 a
month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two companies declined to discuss how much each has
spent to date on the project. The Digital Music Network has
the financial backing of Denver-based Tele-Communications
Inc., the nation's largest cable company, which controls
systems with about 10 million subscribers. Last year,
Tele-Communications signed an agreement to acquire a minority
stake in International Cablecasting, based in Vancouver,
British Columbia.</p>
<p>The digital sound is transmitted onto a video signal that
is transmitted via satellite to cable systems. The cable
systems then transmit the signal to subscribers. The signal
is then reconverted to audio via a digital tuner, which
retails for about $100 or can be rented.</p>
<p>The music, which a spokeswoman for the companies said will
range from rock to classic to show tunes, will be programmed
by the Atlanta-based radio consulting firm Burkhart/Douglas &
Associates.</p>
