	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter market, relieved of
pressure from stock losses overseas, rebounded strongly
yesterday.
   Traders say buying momentum from Monday's close carried
unlisted share prices higher following a recovery in equity
prices in Tokyo and London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A steep plunge on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and elsewhere
had been blamed for pressuring U.S. stock markets.</p>
<p>Robert O'Toole Sr., head of OTC sales trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, says strength in the bond market also helped
lift the over-the-counter market. "I saw buying right across
the board," Mr. O'Toole says of the OTC market yesterday.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 4.47, or about 1%, to
437.65, while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
added 1.3% yesterday.</p>
<p>Total Nasdaq volume was 134.8 million shares, up 23.4
million shares from Monday's 111.4 million shares. National
Market System volume totaled about 102,125,500 shares, up
from Monday's 81,026,100 shares. OTC advancers led decliners,
1,176 to 757.</p>
<p>While traders say yesterday's activity touched all sectors
of the OTC market, some areas received a bigger share of the
buying than others.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes the market's largest
non-financial issues, rose 8.28, or nearly 2%, to 433.62.
Among the largest stocks gaining were MCI Communications,
which added 1 1/2 to 38, and Apple Computer, which advanced 1
1/2 to 41 3/4.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Financial 100 Index, which tracks the OTC
market's largest bank, thrift and insurance stocks, gained
only 1.01, or 0.26% to 392.58.</p>
<p>At the top of the most active list, Tetra Technologies
added 1 1/8 to 12 1/8 from its opening trade. The 2.35
million-share new issue was priced late Monday at $10 each.
Investor demand caused the company to increase the size of
the offering from the 2 million shares originally filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Tetra recyles byproducts and waste from chemical plants to
produce calcium chloride and zinc bromide, as well as other
specialty chemicals, which are used mainly by the domestic
offshore oil and gas industry. The company also sells waste
treatment systems.</p>
<p>Last year, increased well activity in the Gulf of Mexico
caused recycled chemical sales to balloon 60%, boosting the
company's net income by 72% in 1989, according to an official
with the lead underwriter, Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save gained 1 to 11 1/2 on volume of more than 2.2
million shares. Kidder Peabody traders say they handled about
half of that volume, but even they were at a loss to explain
the activity. Monday, Pic 'N' Save eased 1/8 on over 1.3
million shares.</p>
<p>John Giesea, who trades the stock for Kidder, says the
vast majority of the activity came from "institutional or
professional type of accounts as opposed to individuals."</p>
<p>In early February, Pic 'N' Save announced that it would
buy back up to 5 million of its shares. But the company's
chief financial officer said that yesterday's activity is not
related to the buy-back program.</p>
<p>Landmark Graphics plunged 2 1/2 to 18 1/2 in active
trading. The company said its revenue for the third quarter,
ended March 31, will be about 20% below analysts' estimates.
The computer maker blamed changing buying patterns of its
large domestic customers for the revenue shortfall.</p>
<p>Heavy trading volume in Lancaster Colony pushed the stock
onto the most active list with a 1 point loss to 19 3/4.
Monday, Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt & Collopy cut its
investment rating on the stock and lowered its 1990 earnings
estimate for the company. The securities firm cited softness
in consumer mass market business, where about half of
Lancaster's products are sold.</p>
<p>Cambridge BioScience lost 1 1/8 to 5 3/8, while Biotech
Research Laboratories was up 1/2 to 4 7/8. The two companies
yesterday said they plan to merge in a stock swap.</p>
<p>Software Toolworks jumped 1 5/8 to 29 7/8, another new
52-week high for the stock. The educational and entertainment
software company is expected to unveil new products at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in early June.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>TETRA TECHNOLOGIES Inc. said the lead underwriter for its
offering of 2,350,000 common shares is PaineWebber Inc. In
yesterday's OTC Focus column, the lead underwriter was
incorrectly identified.</p>
