	<p class="article-leader">The Global View column on this page Monday, "Who Will Pay
the Bill for Russia's Decline?" used some inaccurately
transmitted statistics regarding man-days lost in the Soviet
Union. The correct numbers are 9.1 million mandays lost in
the first two months this year, compared with 7.3 million for
the full year 1989.
