	<p class="article-leader">Cambridge Capital Fund Limited Partnership, New York, said
it proposed to acquire the 90.4% of Dallas-based Whitehall
Corp., a defense and electronics concern, that it doesn't
already own for $20 a share, or about $62 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Whitehall shares closed at $17.50, up 62.5 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The investment partnership said in a letter to Whitehall
management that it is prepared to negotiate all terms of its
bid. It also said its proposal would be subject to several
conditions, including acquiring financing. A spokesman said
Cambridge is holding talks with financing sources. Still,
Cambridge said it is proceeding with plans to nominate its
own slate of five directors at Whitehall's annual meeting,
scheduled for April 23. It said it hopes its proxy materials
will be available shortly.</p>
<p>Whitehall officials couldn't be reached for comment. Last
month, Whitehall rejected Cambridge's request to meet to
discuss a possible transaction.</p>
