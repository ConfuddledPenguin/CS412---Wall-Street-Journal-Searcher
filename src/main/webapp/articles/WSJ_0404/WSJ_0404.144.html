	<p class="article-leader">BSN Corp. said that it doesn't currently expect to
complete its planned acquisition of National Spirit Group,
which could result in a one-time charge to earnings of "no
more than $3.5 million."
   The Dallas maker of sporting goods said that disagreements
among lenders prevented it from completing the purchase by
the end of March. BSN was to pay $3 million in cash and $15
million in stock and assume $22 million in senior debt under
the transaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BSN originally sold National Spirit, a distributor of
cheerleader supplies and operator of cheerleader camps, to
Prospect Group Inc. of New York in 1988. It offered to buy
back the unit after National Spirit defaulted on its debt
last year.</p>
<p>BSN said it may have to write off $2.7 million that
National Spirit owes it, as well as $500,000 to $600,000 in
estimated expenses. BSN said it expects to include the charge
in 1989 fourth-quarter results, but it might take some of it
for the first quarter of 1990.</p>
