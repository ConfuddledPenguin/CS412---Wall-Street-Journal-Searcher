	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Mediation Board got the train
moving for a presidentially appointed emergency board that
would try to help resolve a railroad-industry labor dispute.
   The board, on request by the negotiating railroads and
unions, proffered arbitration to the parties. Railroad
management quickly rejected the offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This sets the stage for President Bush to name an
emergency board, which the White House says he's willing to
do. While such a board usually has 30 days to make
recommendations for settling the bargaining issues, the
negotiating parties say they will give the board until Sept.
15. Then, the railroads would be free to put any contract
terms into effect that they wish, and the unions would be
free to strike. The two sides are at odds over health-care
costs, work rules and wages.</p>
<p>The parties also agreed that they wouldn't take any action
until 30 days after the emergency board reports, and unless
Congress is in session. Typically, Congress has averted a
long railroad strike by enacting the emergency board's
recommendations after the negotiating parties have rejected
them.</p>
