	<p class="article-leader">United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., agreed to pay $77.5
million to settle several lawsuits in which Texas Air Corp.
affiliates charged United with unfairly competing in the
computer reservations business.
   United disclosed the settlement amount in year-end
financial results filed Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As reported, Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air,
agreed last week to settle its $336 million lawsuit against
United. Among other things, Continental had accused United of
charging excessive fees to it and other airlines when tickets
on their flights were issued through United's Apollo computer
reservation system.</p>
<p>The agreement also settles similar lawsuits filed by New
York Air, Frontier Airlines and Texas Air's System One
computer reservation system, the SEC filing said.</p>
<p>Travel and ticketing agents use computer reservation
systems to get information about airline schedules, fares and
seat availability, and to make reservations and issue tickets
electronically.</p>
