	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. said it will
approve next week a plan to pay interest on certain thrift
obligations after the institutions have been seized by the
government for insolvency.
   Uncertainty over the interest payments has unsettled bond
markets since February, when the RTC, the government's
savings-and-loan restructuring agency, seized Franklin
Savings & Loan of Ottawa, Kan. The RTC said it believed it
had authority under last year's big S&L law to stop paying
interest on certain Franklin debt after the seizure, even
though the interest was backed by a variety of collateral,
including mortgages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recently, both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said they were considering downgrading
more than $20 billion in debt issued by S&Ls, including
mortgage-backed bonds, depending on the RTC's eventual
policy.</p>
<p>RTC Chairman William Seidman said the agency was sending
out an early word on the policy to be adopted, in part, to
quiet concerns of the bond markets. The RTC met with Wall
Street officials Monday to hear their complaints that the
government would be violating bondholders' contracts if it
repudiated the interest payments.</p>
<p>The move affects thrift-issued debt backed by mortgages or
high-yield bonds, or bonds supported by collateralized
letters of credit.</p>
<p>The RTC policy generally would provide for payment of
interest up to the date of redemption of the securities,
subject to the extent of their collateral.</p>
<p>Also, under the policy, the government would have the
right to call securities for early redemption, even if the
contract terms don't provide for early call. But the
government, as receiver, had that right even before the
savings-and-loan law was passed, according to staffers of the
RTC.</p>
<p>The RTC specifically said the interest payments would be
honored for CenTrust Savings of Miami and for Franklin, after
the date of their government seizure. Both were under
specific examination by the RTC.</p>
<p>"It's a positive development," said Michael Bradfield, the
Washington counsel for Franklin Savings, which is in court
trying to overturn the government seizure. "We hope this will
lead to further positive developments, and to the return of
the institution."</p>
