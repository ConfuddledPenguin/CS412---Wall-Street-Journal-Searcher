	<p class="article-leader">Contel Corp., a telecommunications concern, said it plans
to restructure its telephone operations sector to make it
more efficient and market-focused.
   The Atlanta-based company also said it expects to reduce
the sector's work force of 15,000 about 4%, or an indicated
600. Contel said the majority of the reductions will be
concentrated in staff support positions and be made largely
through attrition and voluntary separation programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the restructuring plan, which is expected to be
completed in two years, Contel said it will combine the
sector's three regions and 12 divisions into six operating
units, which will report to the telephone operations
headquarters in Atlanta. Contel said it doesn't expect the
restructuring to have a material effect on consolidated
financial results.</p>
<p>Donald W. Weber, Contel president and chief executive
officer, said that as the industry "becomes more competitive,
it is essential that we have in place a structure that
maximizes our resources."</p>
