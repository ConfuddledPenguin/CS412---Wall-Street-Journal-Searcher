	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Southern Co.'s chief executive officer, Edward
L. Addison, is putting out brush fires at the giant utility
concerning recent disclosures about his son Scott's lucrative
business ties to the company. But a forest fire seems to be
heating up just behind him.
   In the past two weeks, Mr. Addison has been making the
rounds through the four-state electric utility system,
talking with board members and holding sessions with managers
at various levels to offer his explanation and to field
questions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As the heat intensifies on the issue, which is but the
latest in a wide-ranging, two-year federal probe of the
beleaguered utility holding company, the sessions may be a
dress rehearsal for Mr. Addison: He faces a regular Southern
board meeting April 16 and an annual shareholders meeting in
May.</p>
<p>Mr. Addison, who is well-known locally as the dapper and
genial executive featured on Southern's television
advertisements, declined to be interviewed, "based on the
advice of our attorneys," a company spokesman said. The
younger Mr. Addison also declined to be interviewed.</p>
<p>As reported, Southern acknowledged last month that the son
received commissions from the company's pension-fund trades
when he was a broker at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in Atlanta.
Southern had requested that its outside pension-fund managers
direct "up to 20%" of its pension-fund trades to Kidder
Peabody and name the younger Mr. Addison as the broker of
record. When the elder Mr. Addison was told of the proposed
arrangement, he said he would "like to see it done," those
familiar with the matter said. Southern adds that the chief
executive insisted it be done legally and at competitive
costs.</p>
<p>However, the younger Mr. Addison's business ties to
Southern are wider and more long-lasting than initially
disclosed and stretch beyond the company's $2.38 billion
pension fund, a Southern spokesman confirmed.</p>
<p>-- The younger Mr. Addison began soliciting business from
Southern at least as early as December 1983. The company has
confirmed that the younger Mr. Addison, as a 23-year-old
securities broker at Johnson, Lane, Space, Smith & Co. in
Atlanta with just six months experience, telephoned
Southern's Gulf Power Co. unit and recommended that the
company invest in a Government National Mortgage Association
(Ginnie Mae) certificate through his firm. "Based on his
recommendation," Gulf Power invested $500,000 of short-term
funds in a 90-day Ginnie Mae certificate, a Southern
spokesman said. The transaction was handled by another broker
at Johnson Lane, which has since merged to become
Interstate/Johnson Lane. Southern said it didn't know whether
the younger Mr. Addison received any compensation from the
transaction; Interstate/Johnson Lane said it couldn't locate
records on the transaction.</p>
<p>-- In 1986, the younger Mr. Addison solicited Southern
officials to invest in repurchase agreements through Kidder
Peabody, where he worked. Southern said that he helped work
out an agreement under which the utility used Kidder Peabody
as one of several firms for investing short-term cash in the
so-called repos -- transactions in which an investor buys a
security with a pledge to sell it back at a fixed date and
price.</p>
<p>"Scott inquired as to whether Kidder Peabody could be put
on the list of eligible firms that we canvass," said Gale
Klappa, a Southern spokesman. "The response was that we'd
like to use {Kidder Peabody}, but only if we can get a
standard contract signed. Scott went back to Kidder and got
them to sign a contract."</p>
<p>The younger Mr. Addison's attorney, Robert McKnight,
acknowledged that the younger Mr. Addison received small
commissions on the repos.</p>
<p>Kidder Peabody declined to comment.</p>
<p>Southern subsequently purchased a substantial portion of
its repos through Kidder Peabody, but only when the terms
were competitive, Southern said.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Klappa, Mr. Addison said he was unaware
that his son had solicited the utility on behalf of Kidder
Peabody and Johnson Lane until this newspaper inquired about
the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. McKnight also confirmed that Addison & Associates, an
Atlanta brokerage firm at which the younger Mr. Addison is
president, received brokerage commissions from several
vendors that have lucrative contracts with Southern. However,
Southern said none of its vendors was pressured to do
business with the younger Mr. Addison and none was favored as
a result of doing so.</p>
<p>Invesco Capital Management Inc., an Atlanta-based money
manager that handles part of Southern's pension fund,
directed commissions to Addison & Associates in 1989, Mr.
McKnight acknowledged. However, he said the relationship is
unrelated to Southern and results from personal friendships
that the younger Mr. Addison has with Invesco officials. He
also confirmed that Birmingham, Ala.-based Drummond Co., a
big coal supplier to Southern, and that Finley McRae, the
president of Graceville, Fla.-based Apalachee Pole Co., which
is a major supplier of electric poles for Southern, paid
commissions to Addison & Associates last year. However, Mr.
McKnight said those companies obtained Southern contracts
through competitive bidding. "It would be silly to think that
those long-standing relationships could be affected by a
young person just out of college," Mr. McKnight said.</p>
<p>As the elder Mr. Addison works his way through the
Southern system, he is fielding questions on topics such as
the status of a continuing federal tax investigation of
Southern. Justice Department officials in the tax division in
Washington, are reviewing the prosecutors' case to determine
whether to charge Southern with violating criminal statutes
in its accounting for spare parts, according to people close
to the investigation.</p>
<p>Whit Armstrong, an outside director on the board of
Southern's Alabama Power unit, said when Mr. Addison brought
up the topic at a recent board meeting, "Nobody was pressing
him at all. Everybody has known him a long time." Mr.
Armstrong added that Mr. Addison is "credible," noting: "It
seems to be more of a firestorm in the press."</p>
<p>Among a handful of Southern directors who could be
reached, most said they see no serious problems for Mr.
Addison. They expect he will talk about his son's business
ties at the coming board meeting without any prodding. "As I
recall, he voluntarily explains things like this to the board
when they come up," said Earl McLean, an outside director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an internal audit of the son's ties to the
company is under way, and findings will be presented to the
audit committee and the board when it is completed.</p>
