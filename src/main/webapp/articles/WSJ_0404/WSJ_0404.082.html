	<p class="article-leader">New York investor Carl Icahn said his proposal for USX
Corp. to spin off its steel business to shareholders would
create values of $48 for each existing share of USX, or 30%
above the current market price.
   In proxy materials mailed this week to USX shareholders,
Mr. Icahn said that if the company's two main businesses were
split up, Marathon Oil Co. would be worth $39 a USX share and
U.S. Steel would be worth $9 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Icahn wants 80% or more of U.S. Steel distributed to
USX shareholders. He plans to spend between $5 million and
$10 million to persuade USX holders to vote for his proposal
in a nonbinding referendum at the Pittsburgh-based company's
annual meeting May 7.</p>
<p>Separating the steel and energy companies, Mr. Icahn said,
would enable investors to value them more efficiently, give
investors greater freedom of choice, and make management more
accountable.</p>
<p>The Icahn proxy materials contain a chart showing that USX
stock has declined in price since March 31, 1975, while
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen fourfold.</p>
<p>USX shares surged yesterday to $37.125, up $1.50, amid a
general market rally in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The materials also dispute USX management's contention
that a split-up would jeopardize some of the $900 million in
tax-loss carry-forwards that could shelter USX profits from
taxes. Even after the steel business was spun off, he said,
the tax losses would continue to offset Marathon's taxable
income.</p>
<p>The Mt. Kisco, N.Y.-based investor also plans to vote his
13.3% USX stake for other holders' proposals to eliminate
some anti-takeover devices, including staggered board terms
and a poison-pill shareholder rights plan. A poison pill
makes a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. Those
proposals also are nonbinding.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn also is backing proposed bylaw changes to force
USX directors to own at least 2,000 shares of USX stock. He
also backs a measure barring executive compensation
contingent on acquisition of the company. That measure
appears aimed at so-called golden parachute payments for
executives who leave after a takeover.</p>
<p>USX declined to comment on the Icahn proxy materials,
saying it needed more time to study them. But the company
said it favors keeping the poison-pill and staggered-board
measures -- not to thwart an acquisition on favorable terms,
but to deter unfair or coercive offers and preserve
"continuity and stability" by requiring two annual meetings
for a change of control. USX also opposes the stock-ownership
proposal for directors as unnecessary.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn disclosed that he is paying oil industry analyst
Kurt Wulff, chairman of McDEP Associates Inc., $50,000 for
his analysis of a spin-off. He also is paying $200,000 to
D.F. King & Co., a proxy solicitor, and $150,000 to Jefferies
& Co., a securities firm, for helping him solicit votes. If
he wins the vote, he must pay another $200,000 to King and
$450,000 to Jefferies.</p>
<p>The Jefferies firm, which had close ties to corporate
raiders including Mr. Icahn in the mid-1980s, recently hired
several former executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
once Mr. Icahn's chief investment banker, following the
bankruptcy-law filing of Drexel's parent, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc.</p>
<p>Jefferies' former chairman, Boyd Jefferies, pleaded guilty
to federal securities-law violations in connection with the
Ivan Boesky insider-trading case.</p>
