	<p class="article-leader">Most tobacco and liquor companies have become increasingly
vulnerable to criticism that they market their products to
young people. Flying in the face of that trend, a leading
wine marketer is launching a new ad campaign that unabashedly
aims to recruit young drinkers.
   Banfi Vintners, marketers of Riunite wine, hopes the
campaign will be just the shot in the arm that the sagging
Riunite brand needs to boost its sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>William Roethel, Banfi's vice president of marketing,
candidly describes the ad campaign as an effort to "win over
entry-level drinkers." The campaign, which includes radio
commercials that feature young men and women flirting at
parties, is scheduled to begin airing nationwide next month.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the idea of targeting young drinkers
doesn't sit well with critics of the liquor industry. "I'm
shocked they would choose this particular time to launch such
a campaign, given the growing public concern about young
people and alcohol," says Patricia Taylor, director of the
alcohol policies project at the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a lobbying group in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Both liquor and cigarette makers are increasingly under
attack for allegedly targeting young people in their
advertising. Recently, New York City's consumer affairs
commissioner, Mark Green, accused RJR Nabisco of trying to
lure young smokers to its Camel brand with an ad campaign
featuring a cartoon character called Joe Camel. RJR has
denied the charge. Beer companies also have been criticized
for doing special promotions aimed at college students.</p>
<p>The criticism is part of a growing attack on targeted
marketing of all types by liquor and tobacco companies. In
recent months, cigarette makers also have come under fire for
ads aimed at blacks and at women.</p>
<p>Mr. Roethel insists that Banfi isn't proposing to woo
underaged drinkers to the Riunite camp. "That is absolutely
not part of what we're doing," he says. "We're not doing
anything that we aren't proud of."</p>
<p>The Banfi executive says the company decided to go after
younger drinkers in part because of the difficulty of
changing Riunite's low-brow image among older consumers. It
made more sense, according to Mr. Roethel, to work on
instilling a freshened image for the brand among younger
drinkers.</p>
<p>"We're a very palatable entry-level type wine," he says,
referring to Riunite's sweet taste. "Someone who's already
cultivated a wine palate, Riunite isn't going to appeal to
them."</p>
<p>Riunite badly needs a marketing makeover. Although it is
still the top-selling import, sales have been on a downward
spiral since 1984, when they hit a peak of just over 11
million cases. Last year alone, volume dropped more than one
million cases to 4.9 million cases.</p>
<p>For the new campaign, Banfi is reviving its old slogan:
"Riunite on Ice. That's Nice." Since the slogan was dropped
five years ago, Banfi has struggled with a number of
campaigns, including failed attempts to reposition Riunite as
a premium-style brand. "That strategy was a little bit
ill-conceived," Mr. Roethel now says.</p>
<p>The new radio campaign, developed by Ketchum Advertising,
New York, marks a departure for Banfi, which has
traditionally used television to advertise Riunite. One radio
spot plays on the sometimes crude approaches taken by people
when they introduce themselves to members of the opposite sex
at parties. "I'm in construction and my feelings for you are
building," a guy says to a woman. "I don't date men who wear
more jewelry than I do," the woman says to her friends,
recounting the meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Roethel believes the campaign will be a big success.
He says it was tested in eight cities last year, prompting
respectable sales increases. But some wine experts are
skeptical that younger drinkers will be a big, new market for
Riunite. "This is by no means new. Who else {but young
people} ever drank it?" says Paul Gillette, editor and
publisher of Wine Investor, a trade newsletter. "This was
never something that was consumed by refugees from Chateau
Lafite."</p>

<p>Young & Rubicam Award</p>
<p>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. awarded its spot
television buying account to Young & Rubicam, following an
extended review which also included incumbent J. Walter
Thompson and BBDO, a unit of Omnicom Group.</p>
<p>Industry executives estimate billings at $30 million to
$32 million. However, since the account, like other movie
studio accounts, doesn't involve creative work, it isn't as
lucrative as a typical account of that size. Young & Rubicam
will buy local TV time and New York newspaper space.</p>
<p>Young & Rubicam declined to comment, as did Thompson, a
unit of WPP Group. Gene Cameron, who heads BBDO's Los Angeles
and San Francisco offices, said: "We've got the capability
that can be very valuable in the movie business. We're going
to do it somewhere."</p>
<p>The account had been larger at Thompson, where it also
included network media buying. But Fox recently began buying
network time itself, prompting the review, said Bob Harper,
Fox's president of marketing. Thompson had handled the
account for 10 years. Young & Rubicam will take over starting
with Fox's summer lineup, which begins with an Andrew Dice
Clay comedy thriller called "Ford Fairlane."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>KENT CIGARETTES: Lorillard, New York, named Avrett, Free &
Ginsberg, New York, to handle its $8 million to $10 million
Kent cigarette account. The decision follows a creative
shootout lasting several months in which Lorillard, a unit of
Loews Corp., conducted extensive tests with consumers on the
finalists' work. Also pitching the account were Grey
Advertising and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, a unit of
Saatchi & Saatchi Co. The account had been handled by BBDO.</p>
<p>ADWEEK: A/S/M Communications, parent of Adweek magazine,
closed down two additional titles, Media Week and Imaging
Retail News, because of the poor ad environment, said Kenneth
Fadner, president. The closings come less than two weeks
after A/S/M shut down seven other publications. Two
publications that Mr. Fadner had a personal stake in and that
were housed in A/S/M office space, View and Wrap, also
suspended publication.</p>
<p>NETWORK ASSOCIATION: The three major networks created a
new organization, the Network Television Association, to sell
the virtues of network advertising to agencies and
advertisers. The new group, whose formation has been in the
works for a year, will be headed by Peter Chrisanthopoulos,
who had been president of RJR Nabisco Broadcast.</p>
