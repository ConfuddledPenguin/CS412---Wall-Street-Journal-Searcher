	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The door was opened wide yesterday for what
could become a major new employee benefit: employer-financed
housing aid.
   The House, by a voice vote, approved legislation to amend
the Taft-Hartley labor-relations act to allow unions and
employers to create jointly run housing trusts, that would
use employer money to subsidize worker homes or apartments.
The Senate has already approved the measure, and the Bush
administration backs it, so it's expected to soon become law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The immediate effect would be to legalize a labor contract
signed in December 1988 by Local 26 of the Hotel Employees
and Restaurant Employees union with about 20 Boston-area
hotels and other employers. It would help workers in Boston
make down payments and reduce mortgage interest outlays. But
its national impact could be much more far-reaching.</p>
<p>Currently, collective-bargaining agreements can only
provide for jointly managed benefits specifically named in
the Taft-Hartley law, and housing isn't one of them.
Frederick Feinstein, a staff assistant to the House Education
and Labor Committee, says that as unions and employers become
aware of the expected legal change, "we expect to see it
appearing in collective bargaining agreements in the future."</p>
<p>Beyond that, many employers may be spurred to provide such
assistance on their own because of the spotlight on the
Boston agreement and the new law, says Bruce Marks, the Local
26 housing director. He says employers from around the nation
have sought details of the Boston housing trust fund,
apparently eager to know the mechanics of the complicated
arrangement so they can provide similar assistance to help
recruit or retrain needed workers.</p>
<p>In the past two years, there's been a "tremendous
increase" in employer-provided housing assistance, says
Richard Ferlauto, special projects director for the American
Affordable Housing Institute, a research group affiliated
with Rutgers University. He says the increase has been
spurred by a drop in federal housing aid and a growing
realization among employers that worker turnover and
absenteeism resulting from lack of nearby affordable housing
is costly.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferlauto estimates that 300 U.S. employers provide
some kind of housing aid to workers, excluding hundreds of
college and hospital-related plans. Meanwhile, unions
including the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, Hotel
Workers, Service Employees, Clothing & Textile Workers,
Garment Workers, Communications Workers of America, United
Auto Workers and United Food & Commercial Workers appear
interested in devising collective-bargaining strategies aimed
at winning their own housing assistance, he says.</p>
<p>"Indications are that this is the next new benefit that
unions will be looking for in the 1990s," says Mr. Ferlauto.</p>
<p>Billionaire Donald Trump's new Trump Taj Mahal Casino
Resort in Atlantic City, N.J., has hired 7,200 workers, many
of them from Puerto Rico and Europe. Until they find homes,
the Trump organization is paying their full hotel bills for
30 days and all but $15 a night for the next 15 days.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania guarantees loans to its
employees to buy houses without any down payment. There used
to be some collectively bargained housing-benefit pacts long
before the 1947 Taft-Hartley law. In one 1911 contract, for
instance, a union bargained to reduce the amount that workers
paid to live in a New Jersey company town's housing to $2.50
a day from $3.</p>
<p>The 13 hotels and other Boston establishments covered by
the Local 26 contract will pay nearly $1.5 million into the
trust fund over the agreement's three years; they must pay
five cents for each hour worked by the 5,000 Local 26
members. The money will be used to help workers make down
payments on houses, reduce the interest they must pay on
mortgage loans, make cooperative share loans, and subsidize
rental deposits and emergency rental aid.</p>
<p>Local 26 says a recent survey of its members showed 75%
face housing problems such as overcrowding, deterioration,
high rent and imminent displacement. In Boston, one of the
highest-cost cities for housing in the nation, 98% of the
union's members can't afford to buy a median-priced home, and
78% can't pay rent for a median-priced apartment, the local
says.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Local 26 members are lower-paid women
or minorities.</p>
<p>"I'd like to have the opportunity to buy a piece of
property someday," says Marie Downey, a Local 26 member who
works as a waitress at the Park Plaza Hotel. "Right now,
there's no way I can afford one," she says, but with the new
housing aid, "that could become a reality."</p>
<p>Sens. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Orrin Hatch (R.,
Utah), chairman and ranking minority member, respectively, of
the Senate Labor Committee, helped win Senate approval for
the bill. Rep. William Clay (D., Mo.), chairman of the House
labor-management relations subcommittee, pushed it in the
House.</p>
<p>The Taft-Hartley law banned most joint use of employer
funds by unions and management in order to prevent collusion
and corruption that could emerge from such arrangements.
Since then, the law has been amended to allow collectively
bargained trusts for health, retirement and life-insurance
benefits, scholarships, child-care assistance, legal services
and funds for various cooperative efforts by labor and
management.</p>
