	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Democrats on the House Banking Committee
decided to push for passage of two pieces of savings-and-loan
legislation this year.
   One bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),
would ban savings and loans from selling uninsured bonds in
their lobbies. In the failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan,
Irvine, Calif., thousands of investors said they believed
they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit
in Lincoln's lobby. About $200 million in bonds were issued
by Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp., Phoenix, and
are now believed to be worthless since the company filed for
bankruptcy protection a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Another bill, sponsored by Rep. David Price (D., N.C.),
would give the government greater latitude in dissolving
"golden parachutes," which are lucrative severance contracts,
for managers of failed thrifts.</p>
<p>According to committee members' staff, the Democrats on
the 51-member panel said they expect to begin drafting the
legislation in three weeks, after a congressional recess.</p>
