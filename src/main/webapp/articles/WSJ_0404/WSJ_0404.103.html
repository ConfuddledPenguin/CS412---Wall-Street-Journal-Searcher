	<p class="article-leader">Sick of Nurse Shortage,
   Hospitals Start Selling</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HOSPITALS are launching some rather extreme recruiting
campaigns to cope with the nursing shortage.</p>
<p>HCA Corp.'s Largo Medical Center Hospital in Largo, Fla.,
bought billboard space in Pittsburgh, Cleveland and other
northern cities to promote the advantages of careers in
Florida. The pitch includes an 800 number to call about
"white sand, blue skies and red hot nursing opportunities."</p>
<p>Despite a mild winter, there are apparently plenty of
nurses eager to move South. "We've had a lot of husbands
calling for their wives," says hospital marketing director
Judy Dean.</p>
<p>Others are finding it takes more than billboards to find
nurses. The University of Kentucky hospital has hired a
Chicago marketing firm to "develop an image for nursing,"
says Diana Weaver, the university's director of nursing.</p>
<p>The university hospital also offers free plane tickets to
anywhere in the U.S. to any employee who refers a nurse who
joins the staff. "We're facing a chronic nursing shortage,"
Ms. Weaver says, noting she needs to add 200 nurses to keep
up with planned hospital expansion.</p>
<p>The competition within the state is fierce: One regional
hospital offered $10,000 signing bonuses to woo nurses away.
Out-of-state nurses, meanwhile, are often leery of moving to
the Bluegrass State, and so need extra coaxing.</p>
<p>"We compete with some glitzy areas," Ms. Weaver concedes.
"Kentucky is an unknown entity."</p>
<p>Hitting the Books</p>
<p>To Cover Teen Market</p>
<p>NOW TEEN-AGERS and their books can be walking billboards
for advertisers.</p>
<p>Cover Concepts Marketing Services Inc., a fledgling
Stoughton, Mass., company, has signed up high schools in 99
cities to receive four million free book covers plastered
with ads.</p>
<p>The cost to advertisers ranges from $25,000 to $195,000,
depending on the size of the ad and how many semesters it
appears. For their money, they get a captive audience.</p>
<p>"The high school market is one of the most difficult to
reach. {Students} have no patience," says Michael Yanoff,
chief executive of Cover Concepts.</p>
<p>The idea was tested in Massachusetts schools this year,
with sponsors such as Nike Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Maxell Corp.
and CB Sports, a maker of jackets. The next school year's
covers could include McDonald's Corp. and Nintendo, among
others.</p>
<p>While ads on books aren't likely to stir as much
controversy as Whittle Communications did with the
commercials on its Channel One school TV programs, the book
covers still aren't welcome in every classroom. New York City
schools say the book covers aren't acceptable because the ads
are too large. If the ads were just "postage stamp" size, New
York city schools wouldn't object, says spokesman Bob Terte.
"But we don't want the kids to be used."</p>
<p>Fast Food Is No Art,</p>
<p>But Selling It Sure Is</p>
<p>COMPETITION IS no laughing matter, and that's where the
funnies come in.</p>
<p>Burger King, as part of its "Sometimes You've Gotta Break
the Rules" advertising campaign, has introduced a line of
sandwich cartons and beverage cups decorated with drawings,
most of them whimsical.</p>
<p>The chain's new Pick 'Em Ups chicken and fish finger food
will come in cartons decorated with campy, '50s-style, soap
opera comics. The dialogue in the bubble, of course, is about
the food. In one, a teen-age girl is thinking: "Oh Drat. His
class ring] And I thought he was gonna give me Pick 'Em Ups."</p>
<p>On another package, double cheeseburgers are identified by
a giant burger being built by cartoon construction workers.</p>
<p>Cups show cartoon versions of U.S. landmark buildings,
such as the St. Louis arch and the Empire State Building. The
most serious of the containers is for the Ocean Catch fish
sandwich, sold in boxes decorated with beach scenes.</p>
<p>King-Casey Inc., the New Canaan, Conn., design consultant
that came up with the packaging, plans to bring out new comic
strips and beach scenes every couple of months.</p>
<p>Designers believe consumers want to be entertained, not
just fed. Happy consumers, the creators say, make return
trips. And that's something the No. 2 fast-food chain needs
these days.</p>
<p>"Consumers have many choices for the next meal," says Gene
Casey, president of King-Casey. "If Burger King wants their
business, we have to reward them for making a visit."</p>
<p>Still, many package designers say it can be risky to
change any brand's look so often. "It's a thin approach,"
says Ronald Peterson, managing partner of Peterson & Blyth
Associates Inc., a New York design firm. "They're focusing on
promotions programs and packaging changes instead of putting
the emphasis on the food itself."</p>
<p>His advice: "Let's have a good, healthy burger."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>THREE CHEERIOS for success: Of the 6,960 new brands
introduced in the past two years, 240 have reached the $1
million annual sales mark, according to a study by
Arbitron/SAMI, a product-tracking service owned by Control
Data. The best seller was Apple Cinnamon Cheerios, with $92
million in sales. . . . Lost and Found: Telemap Navigation
Service of Walnut Creek, Calif., offers subscribers an 800
number to call when in need of directions in 1,100 cities. .
. . Dr. Goodpet Laboratories, Inglewood, Calif., markets
all-natural flea collars, as well as natural remedies for pet
motion sickness and stress.</p>
