	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Oil production by the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in March was 23.7 million
barrels a day, unchanged from February levels, according to
the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
   Among OPEC countries, a 200,000 barrel-a-day rise in
Iranian production in March, to 3.1 million barrels a day,
was counterbalanced by a slight decline in Libyan and
Venezuelan production.</p>
