	<p class="article-leader">Congressional arrogance finds new meaning in the pending
legislative appropriations bill for Congress. Roll Call, the
Capitol Hill newspaper, has discovered a last-minute
committee addition that would exempt Members from serving on
juries in their home districts. Members are now routinely
excused from jury duty on account of their business in
Washington, but that's not enough for Democratic Rep. Vic
Fazio, the chief defender of Congressional perks. He says
several Members asked him to draft the law, because, "it's a
hassle in the sense that you have to go through that work" of
getting excused from service. GOP Rep. Jerry Lewis promises a
fight on the House floor next month, and even Democratic Rep.
Jack Brooks, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, says the
law "hardly seems necessary." Rep. Fazio and his friends
apparently feel so invulnerable to defeat that they are
willing to try to enact laws disconnecting them from the
dreary responsibilities of their own districts.</p>
