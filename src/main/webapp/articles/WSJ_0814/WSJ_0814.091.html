	<p class="article-leader">It was, according to my friend Vinnie the Altar Boy, "hot"
in Our Lady of Grace Church on Avenue W in Brooklyn on that
Sunday in August 1949. The Friendly Frost fans were blowing
hot air at the congregation and it was standing room only
because this was the "10 o'clock" and that was Father
Cafaro's Mass. We all knew he didn't handle the heat too well
and would have everybody out in 40 minutes.
   Father Cafaro crossed us up. He stood at the pulpit,
perspiration dripped down his face, and gave a long sermon on
communism. He told us how godless communism was the greatest
threat to our freedom. Then he told us we must all pray for
the conversion of Russia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I was 13 and my friend and I giggled at the word
"conversion," because the only conversion we knew came after
a touchdown was scored by the football Giants and very often
a conversion was the difference between our fathers and
uncles beating the point spread.</p>
<p>So, for the next 40 years, Father Cafaro and those priests
who followed prayed for the conversion of Russia. They were
war years -- most times it was a cold war, occasionally it
got hot. There was Korea, the A-bomb, Castro, the Missile
Crisis, Vietnam, Joe McCarthy ripping the country apart,
Nikita Khrushchev screaming "We will bury you," bomb
shelters, Sputnik ("My God, they're winning space") . . .</p>
<p>We never had a moment when our politicians weren't telling
us that our way of life, our freedom, was being threatened by
communism. This was the generation that lived under the gun,
and if it consumed too much aspirin, Valium, grass, cocaine,
Haagen-Dazs ice cream, acid, Perrier . . . it had to be
forgiven, because we all grew up being taught to duck and
cover under our desks if we saw a flash of light. This would
save us, they said, from the hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p>And then one day the headlines in the papers and the local
news told us we'd won. The wall was down. The other guys were
on the ropes. Father Cafaro's prayers of 1949 had been
answered in 1989. And we were all so numb and so weary that
we walked around saying, "Hey, how about that Berlin Wall?"
in the same voice we've said "Hey, how about those Mets?" But
we won. And nothing could hurt us now.</p>
<p>It lasted about eight months. The headlines one Saturday
read "Brennan Resigns from Court" and by Monday they read
"Bush to Move Swiftly to Select a Successor."</p>
<p>That day, a timid looking little man who bears a striking
resemblance to Mad magazine's ("What? Me Worry?") Alfred E.
Newman was being introduced to the U.S. as the latest
prospective member of the court. Nowhere in the introduction
was there any mention that this is the man who will tip the
balance of power in the court for the next 30 years.</p>
<p>Those who watched the C-SPAN coverage of that press
conference saw George Bush whining his latest version of
"Read My Lips": "No, I didn't ask him his views on abortion.
Let's not make abortion the litmus test of a Supreme Court
justice." None bothered to ask the president, "If the future
freedom of our children is not a litmus test of a Supreme
Court Justice, what is?"</p>
<p>As I watched the president turn away question after
question from the press and heard his excuse for why the
country couldn't hear Judge Souter's views on abortion until
the Senate heard them first, my mind kept going back to that
great Walt Kelly "Pogo" cartoon where the swamp animals
finally come to the conclusion that "We Have Met The Enemy
and They Is Us."</p>
<p>And what does this new court mean? To me, it means that my
four-year-old daughter no longer has -- and might not have in
her lifetime -- the right to her own body . . . her right to
free choice. And if, in the future, she should ever become
pregnant, she must have an unwanted baby because the state
says she must, and that will be the law of the land. It means
my 15-month-old son will grow up in a world where if he is a
homosexual, he will have to stay in the closet for life
because the state will recognize only "real" men and real
"child-bearing" women just like the Russians would have done
to us if they'd had the chance.</p>
<p>We will live to see many of the freedoms that were won in
our lifetimes taken away by the Bushes, the Scalias, the
Anthony Kennedys, and now, the Souters. Roe v. Wade? Forget
it. We'll be lucky if Miranda and Brown v. Board of Education
are around when it's over.</p>
<p>I'm a Republican/Libertarian who has never voted for a
Democrat in his life. But I'm also a Republican who has
always believed you can't have too conservative a president,
nor too liberal a Supreme Court -- and that makes me a
republican in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>And so, this Sunday, a 54-year-old Republican/Libertarian
will go back to that little church on Avenue W in Brooklyn,
and he will kneel and say his first prayer in 40 years. I
will pray for the conversion of George Bush and his Supreme
Court.</p>
