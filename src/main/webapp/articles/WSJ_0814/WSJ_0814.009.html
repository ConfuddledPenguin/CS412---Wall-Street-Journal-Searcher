	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Entrepreneur Asil Nadir, a faded star of the
London stock market, looks set to make his most flamboyant
move yet as he prepares to take his Polly Peck International
PLC private.
   Polly Peck said Mr. Nadir, chairman of the food and
electronics group, is considering a bid for the 74% of the
company he doesn't already control. Based on Polly Peck's
closing price yesterday, such an offer would be worth roughly
#1.3 billion ($2.43 billion). Mr. Nadir couldn't be reached
for comment yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move surprised London investors. Polly Peck shares
soared an initial 15% yesterday to 450 pence ($8.42) on
London's stock exchange. The shares later fell back to trade
at 417 pence apiece, up 24 pence from Friday against a
generally declining market. Except for a short statement
confirming Mr. Nadir's approach, Polly Peck declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Nadir's suggested buy-out would cap a decade of hectic
growth for Polly Peck -- and simultaneously remove from the
public spotlight one of Britain's more-colorful companies.
Born in Turkish Cyprus and educated in Istanbul, Mr. Nadir
bought a majority stake in what was then a tiny British
textiles concern to give his Turkish food businesses a
foothold in London's financial markets. Eventually, he built
Polly Peck into a miniconglomerate of food and electronics
interests. Last year, pretax profit rose 44% to #161 million
on sales of #1.16 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Nadir's two most-spectacular purchases occurred just
last fall. In September, Polly Peck agreed to pay #557
million for the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s
Del Monte foods unit. A month later, the company paid 15.6
billion yen ($103.7 million) for 51% of Japan's Sansui
Electric Co., a rare instance of a foreigner buying control
of a Japanese electronics company. Polly Peck subsequently
raised its Sansui stake to 71%.</p>
<p>But Polly Peck's shares have suffered recently, with
investors raising eyebrows over the quirkiness of the group's
range of businesses. This month's political upheaval in the
Middle East, where Polly Peck still has business interests,
also hit the company's shares. Before yesterday's
announcement and subsequent stock-price jump, Polly Peck
shares traded at roughly eight times analysts' estimates for
1990 earnings.</p>
<p>But analysts generally accept Mr. Nadir's contention that
Polly Peck is worth more. "The market underestimates the
quality of the {company}, especially since the Del Monte
acquisition," says Bill Myers, a food analyst at Henderson
Crosthwaite in London. "There are good, solid, American guys
running the food division."</p>
<p>Any announcement from Mr. Nadir isn't likely before Sept.
6, when Polly Peck is due to report its half-year earnings. A
bidding contest for Polly Peck appears unlikely, as Mr.
Nadir's stake in the company would be a formidable obstacle
for any rival.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear how Mr. Nadir would finance a buy-out. The
political instability in the Middle East might hamper efforts
to raise cash there. But Mr. Nadir might well undertake a
partial breakup of the group to pay off debt arising from a
buy-out. He previously has expressed interest in floating the
company's fresh-produce interests. And earlier this year,
Polly Peck floated a 15% stake in its Turkish electronics
unit, Vestel Electronik Sanayaii ve Ticaret AS, on the
Istanbul Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The announcement that Mr. Nadir is considering an offer
for Polly Peck followed weekend British news reports
suggesting that U.K. tax officials are investigating trading
in Polly Peck stock before the announcement of the Del Monte
purchase. The reports didn't allege any wrongdoing by Polly
Peck or Mr. Nadir. Officials of Britain's Inland Revenue
couldn't be reached for comment. A Polly Peck spokesman said
the company hadn't been approached by any government
officials concerning any probe.</p>
<p>If Mr. Nadir takes Polly Peck private, he will follow in
the footsteps of another well-known U.K. entrepreneur.
Voicing disenchantment with the U.K. stock market, Richard
Branson and management of his Virgin Group PLC spent #99
million taking the company private in 1988.</p>
