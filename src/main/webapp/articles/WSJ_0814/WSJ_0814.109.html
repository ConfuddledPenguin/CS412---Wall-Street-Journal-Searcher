	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Prices of several wheat futures contracts sank
to life-of-contract lows amid signs that Soviet purchases of
U.S. wheat are shriveling.
   Prices of some corn futures contracts tumbled to their
lowest levels since February as good growing weather in the
Midwest continued to improve the prospects for an
eight-billion bushel corn harvest this fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was a big down day," said Victor Lespinasse, an
assistant vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.</p>
<p>In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the wheat
contract for September delivery fell to a new low of $2.7375
a bushel before settling the day at $2.7525 a bushel, down
5.25 cents.</p>
<p>The price of the September wheat contract has fallen about
30% over the past year amid the combination of forecasts for
a big harvest in the U.S. this year as well as slumping
demand from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department reported last week that the
U.S. wheat harvest should increase 33% from last year's crop,
which was damaged by drought.</p>
<p>At the same time, good growing weather in the Soviet Union
is increasing crop prospects there, and cutting its need for
U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>According to Daniel W. Basse, director of market research
at AgResource Co., Chicago, the pace of U.S. wheat exports
has dropped 32% since June 30, compared with the year-earlier
period.</p>
<p>Because of the Soviet crop prospects, most analysts expect
the Soviet Union to reduce its grain imports from all sources
by roughly 20% through next June. It isn't clear how U.S.
trade will be affected; however, the U.S. is one of the
largest shippers of grain to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Crop prices were also depressed yesterday by reports that
the Soviet Union's plan to sell roughly $5 billion in
diamonds is running into internal opposition. U.S. grain
traders had been speculating that the cash-strapped Soviet
Union would use some of the proceeds from any diamond sales
to buy U.S. crops.</p>
<p>In July, the Soviet Union agreed to sell diamonds to the
Swiss branch of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. and to
borrow $1 billion from the company.</p>
<p>According to traders, the Russian Federation is apparently
opposing the move by the central government. It isn't clear
whether that will block the pact, but the Russian republic is
a source of Soviet diamonds.</p>
<p>U.S. grain exports also seem to be slipping at least
temporarily under the weight of higher fuel costs, which
increases shipping costs, traders said.</p>
<p>After the close of trading yesterday, the weekly crop
condition reports by Midwest states indicated that the corn
crop is maturing slowly. The unusually wet spring delayed the
planting season.</p>
<p>However, the crop generally is in good shape even though
rainfall in some states such as Iowa has been the heaviest in
118 years.</p>
<p>In that state, 91% of the corn crop is in excellent or
good condition, compared with 89% a week earlier. While the
rainfall has washed out some fields, it has helped restore
subsoil moisture that was exhausted during the 1988 drought.</p>
<p>Soybean prices dropped yesterday in the wake of beneficial
rains in the Mississippi Delta region, where conditions have
been dry.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Persian Gulf activities again overshadowed all
other factors in influencing petroleum prices and futures
trading yesterday. Spot prices for North Sea crudes were 35
cents to 55 cents a barrel higher. September crude on the New
York Mercantile Exchange was 54 cents higher, at $26.77 a
barrel, when trading was halted because of a power outage in
lower Manhattan. Prices were bolstered by reports that an
Iraqi pipeline across Saudi Arabia was closed and an Iraqi
tanker had been turned away from a Saudi terminal.</p>
<p>But events outside the Middle East helped buoy prices, as
well. For the fourth time in 11 days, North Sea oil workers
stopped work in a bid for union recognition and better safety
rules. News reports said some 7,000 workers walked out in the
24-hour wildcat strike, but added that the companies involved
put the number much lower and said production wasn't being
affected. Separately, the Houston Ship Channel was hit by yet
another oil spill. A barge buckled, spilling 20,000 gallons
of heating oil into the channel, according to Coast Guard
officials. The waterway was obstructed, but not closed.</p>
<p>NEW YORK MARKETS: A major power failure struck New York
City's downtown financial district early yesterday afternoon,
shutting down electricity and disrupting communications.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman at the Commodity Exchange, which is in the
World Trade Center, said the clocks on the exchange froze at
1:13 p.m. EDT and trading was suspended shortly afterward.</p>
<p>"There are no closing or settling prices because the
exchange floor is pitch dark and the prices on the boards on
the wall aren't visible," the spokeswoman said. The Commodity
Exchange is part of a five-exchange complex housed in the
Commodity Exchange Center. All the exchanges share the same
trading floor.</p>
<p>At around 2 p.m., the personnel of the exchanges were
evacuated and sent home.</p>
<p>Precious metals, with trading spurred by the volatile
Middle Eastern situation, were strong at the time of their
suspension. The August gold contract, which will cease
trading Aug. 29, was up $8.30 an ounce based on the last
posted trade, at $405.20. The most-active September contract
advanced $8.10 to $414.00. September silver surged, outdoing
even gold as it last traded at $5.1520 an ounce, for a gain
of 16.10 cents. October platinum rose $9.70 an ounce to
$506.00.</p>
<p>James Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial
Management Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., said that in the gold
sector, "The market's ability to rise above $400 and hold the
gains was very significant."</p>
<p>Ian MacDonald, vice president, Credit Suisse, New York,
said "the majority of the buying, especially for bullion, is
coming out of the Middle East," adding, "There seems to be a
major shift among investors toward gold because of war and
inflation." He noted that silver was pulled up by gold.</p>
<p>London dealers said investors in the Far East, Europe and
the U.S. also joined in the buying that sent gold hurtling
higher.</p>
<p>The gold price could rise as high as $423, analysts said.
But the market is very volatile, and any setback, such as a
slump in the global stock market, could be negative for gold
because it would point to a recession and slower jewelry
demand, they said.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Metal Trading
Advisors in Toronto, said a number of factors accounted for
the exceptional strength of the gold market. "There is a
tightness in the gold supply," he said. This triggered
short-covering, or the buying back of contracts by traders
who had previously sold in anticipation that prices would
decline, Mr. Nichols said.</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols said producers had been heavy sellers
recently. Yesterday, however, "apparently they didn't have
any more gold to sell, and this helped prices rise more than
had been expected."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Nichols noted, gold was due to go up because
"it had some catching up with the rise in the price of oil
and to compensate for the drop in the dollar."</p>
<p>Last-trade prices were mixed in the "soft" commodity
markets. September delivery cocoa was down $44 per metric ton
to $1,097, while October sugar was unchanged at 10.49 cents a
pound. September coffee was up 2.10 cents a pound at 95.60
cents, mostly on reports that a dock strike may be erupting
in Brazil, the world's major coffee producer.</p>
<p>September copper's last trade was at $1.2010, for a
decline of 1.90 cents a pound. There was strong
options-related buying early in the day in London, but this
petered out later. By the time copper opened for trading in
New York on the Commodity Exchange prices in London had
already turned downward, and the decline was reflected in the
New York market in what one analyst described as "dull
trading." Cash markets for copper were quiet. Japan has
recently been a strong buyer of physical copper but no
interest was in evidence from that quarter yesterday, an
analyst said. Another analyst noted that Thursday's intraday
high of $1.3430 in the New York September contract, which was
a new life-of-contract high, was the highest price for that
contract since October 1989. October cotton was off 1.55
cents a pound to 73.35 cents. A trader said contracts were
sold in the wake of a U.S. Department of Agriculture report.
"It was mildly bullish," the trader added, "but that had been
expected and was already in the market. Traders then started
selling."</p>
