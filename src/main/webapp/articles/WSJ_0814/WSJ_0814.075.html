	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices rebounded sharply in thin trading
as bargain-hunters picked through the market after a weekend
that passed without a much-feared meltdown in the Middle
East.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.20 points to
2746.78 as 122.8 million shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. Bond prices fell amid continued worries that
inflation is picking up. The dollar weakened against most
other major currencies, with traders betting that the Federal
Reserve will soon move to lower U.S. interest rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some of the last-minute surge in the Dow industrials was
powered by futures-related program buying, but traders said
they detected a broadly focused wave of bargain-hunting.</p>
<p>"It was as if investors started coming in with a whole
bunch of confidence," said Paul Hennessey, head of equities
trading at Boston Co. He noted, however, that volume was
restrained by a power failure in lower Manhattan, which
hampered some securities firms.</p>
<p>Joseph J. McAlinden, director of equity research at Dillon
Read, said investors are beginning to recognize that
companies other than those in the oil industry, such as basic
and precious metals producers, will be able to make money
despite higher inflation.</p>
<p>"I'd rather own stocks that can act as a hedge against
inflation than bonds that get hurt by it," he said.</p>
<p>But while stock investors may be able to find ways to
prosper amid higher inflation, fixed-income investors have
more to worry about. And yesterday, a sharp jump in gold
prices reinforced inflation fears.</p>
<p>Currency traders pushed the dollar lower on the growing
expectation of lower U.S. interest rates, which would make
dollar-denominated investments less attractive compared with
foreign instruments. Traders are betting that the Fed will
have to ease short-term rates to stave off a recession, which
has grown more likely as a result of higher oil prices, said
Lorenzo Troni, foreign-exchange trader at PaineWebber
International Ltd.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell on thin Big Board volume. Declining
issues edged out advancers, 766 to 726.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each
$1,000 of face amount in light trading. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.80%.</p>
<p>The dollar ended lower. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5765 marks and 150.40 yen, compared
with 1.5905 marks and 150.45 yen Friday.</p>
