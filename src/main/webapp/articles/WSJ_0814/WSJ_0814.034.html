	<p class="article-leader">OIL CITY, Pa. -- Jim Preston, a graying 70-year-old with
thick glasses and hands as black as coal, whispers about his
secret stash buried in the green foothills of Allegheny
mountains.
   "Eighty gallons," he says. And he's not talking moonshine.
His barrels are filled with some of the world's finest crude
oil, though there is precious little of it. Following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, the lukewarm commodity has turned red
hot, with local refineries paying $23 for a 42-gallon barrel,
compared with $16.50 in June. Although no one expects a gush
of new drilling, already locals talk of bringing back wells
idled since the last oil crisis of the late 1970s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If it gets up to $25 a barrel, then I guess I'll let it
go," says the fourth-generation driller of his 80 gallons on
hand. "This is the first time I've ever been able to control
my destiny."</p>
<p>Nearby, another driller, Thomas Breene, is sitting on
1,500 gallons. "I'm not in any hurry to sell it."</p>
<p>Mr. Breene is just one of dozens of Pennsylvanians trying
to make a living drilling oil. In an industry dominated by
Exxons and Mobils, the midget oil producers here are
struggling anachronisms. They are often one-person operations
that own a handful of wells and sell to local refineries.
Their owners frequently supplement their incomes with
construction jobs, contracting oil-field work for out-of-town
investors or even raising capons. For them, the rise in oil
prices means the difference between a tiny profit and a loss,
or between operating and abandoning a well.</p>
<p>It's only fitting that a global oil crisis should be so
profoundly felt by independent oil men in northwestern
Pennsylvania. For it was in this valley that the oil industry
was born in 1859.</p>
<p>That year, Col. Edwin Drake drilled the world's first
commercial well just outside of Oil City and down the Oil
Creek in a town called Titusville. Within five years, 900
wells dotted the Oil Creek valley. Boom towns with names like
Petroleum Centre and Red Hot sprung up and lasted until the
well ran dry -- which in the case of Pit Hole, population
15,000, was 500 days. Oil City became the transportation and
industry hub.</p>
<p>Many aspects of the modern oil industry, from pipelines to
diamond drills, have their roots here. Local petroleum
geologist Samuel T. Pees argues that a well drilled in the
middle of rocky Oil Creek qualifies as the first offshore
drilling. He points to the "precursor to the ocean-going
tanker": four-foot-square boats that carried 400 barrels up
Oil Creek to the Allegheny River and onto Pittsburgh. The Oil
Creek & Titusville Railroad beckons tourists to take a trip
through the "Valley that Changed the World."</p>
<p>But residents lament that most Americans now associate oil
with Texas and J.R. Ewing and northwest Pennsylvania with
deer. Even Oil City natives like Pennzoil Co. moved
headquarters to Texas, where the wells are deeper and the oil
can be sucked up with a straw. The population here is half
its peak of 30,000. A local realtor's "Buy Me" signs are as
plentiful as mailboxes, and City Manager Thomas Rockovich is
searching for some non-oil related industry to fill an empty
steel plant that made oil pipelines.</p>
<p>The problem with Oil City wells is that they're shallow
and old. They don't gush, they dribble, pumping just enough
to fill a Texan's 10-gallon hat. So-called peach-can wells
produce a tin can's worth -- enough for a lawnmower. There
was so little money to make that Quaker State Oil Co., which
has its headquarters here, sold its shallow oil-well business
in 1988.</p>
<p>Local drillers figure they need eight wells to produce a
barrel a day, and unless crude oil prices exceed $20, they're
pumping red ink -- not black gold. Only when refiners pay $30
a barrel does septuagenarian Mr. Preston figure he can build
a nest egg and possibly hang up his oil-stained blue work
clothes.</p>
<p>So while the rest of the world is cursing the rising
crude-oil price and its impact at the gasoline pump, the
industry's little squirts are quietly counting their
blessings.</p>
<p>"We've had a long dry spell for four years," says Charles
Baker, sitting outside the Log Cabin restaurant on the hood
of a Buick Riviera and chewing a toothpick. "I hope I'm
wrong, but I don't think it will go over $28. I hope it goes
to $50. Hell, I hope it goes to $100."</p>
<p>Although it's not clear exactly what impact rising oil
prices will have on the area, few believe Oil City will
return to its boomtown size. There are new environmental
expenses on top of production costs that are already among
the highest in the world because of the shallow, low-yield
wells. Moreover, it costs $25,000 to $30,000 to drill a new
well, and banks are reluctant to loan money in such a
boom-bust business, local drillers say.</p>
<p>"The cream is gone. It's so much easier to get it
elsewhere," says Mr. Preston. A tough man who cleans his
hands by wiping them on the nearest tree, Mr. Preston still
squeezes about half a barrel of oil a day out of a
900-foot-deep well drilled in the late 1800s. The well runs
on a 1905 mechanical pump with locomotive-size wheels that he
has to crank to get moving. It's one of only 40 of his 100
wells that are operating; he can't afford a crew for the rest
and budgets based on what he has in his wallet that
afternoon. "People would say we're insane, if you look at the
economics of it," he says.</p>
<p>Rising oil prices could make him appear less crazy.
Geologist Mr. Pees says the area is still oil-rich and that
each dollar-a-barrel boost may make it feasible to put
another abandoned oil field back into production.</p>
<p>"At $20 a barrel some fields can begin to produce to make
a slight profit, and at $23 another field may come on line,
and at $25 still more," he says. City Manager Mr. Rockovich
says that during the last oil crisis, Oil City's Venago
County was second in the U.S. in terms of new wells being
drilled.</p>
<p>That, however, was before strict state environmental
legislation was passed. Driller Mike Perrett thinks the days
of new wells are over, because drillers can't afford the
$25,000 bond to drill wells under a state law enacted in the
mid-1980s. He has a new name for the state's Department of
Environmental Regulation: Department of Employment Reduction.</p>
<p>Driller Don Taylor, who raises cattle and capons to make
ends meet, says that at the very least, rising prices should
help him repair broken wells that have been too costly to
fix. Indeed, Mr. Breene says replacing a stretch of broken
pipe costs $1,000, which could take several years to recoup.
"At $12 a barrel, it's not feasible to repair wells. At $25 a
barrel, it's something you look at," he says.</p>
<p>More than anything else, these drillers are looking for
stability. Many long-timers have already ridden
roller-coaster crude oil prices and fear such a
crisis-generated price boost won't last.</p>
<p>"It can go up as fast as go down," says Wilma Weaver, who
along with her husband has been in the business for 30 years.
"This little bit helps, but who knows how long it will last."</p>
