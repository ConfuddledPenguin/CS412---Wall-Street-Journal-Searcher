	<p class="article-leader">Affording a House
   Isn't Getting Any Easier</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HOUSING ISN'T likely to become more affordable for the
average American anytime soon, despite declining real-estate
prices in some areas.</p>
<p>The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University
recently released its annual report on the state of the
nation's housing. Slumps in residential construction and
economic difficulties caused by the savings and loan bailout
are seen as evidence of a weak housing market. But lower
prices are confined to certain local markets, the center
says, and persistent declines in home prices and rents are
unlikely on a national scale.</p>
<p>This is good news for the many homeowners whose home
equity is their largest single asset. But the news isn't so
good for aspiring homeowners. Over half of baby boomers own
homes. Fewer homes will be built over the next decade, and
they will be bigger and more expensive, as baby boomers trade
up.</p>
<p>Increasingly upscale housing stock means renters will find
it as difficult as ever to become homeowners. People need two
things to buy a house: cash for the down payment and closing
costs, and income to pay the mortgage.</p>
<p>Some people have one but not the other. Among young
renters ages 25 to 34, 40% have the income to qualify for a
mortgage, but only 19% have the accumulated wealth for a down
payment. Relatively few have both. Just 20% of white renters
and 4% of black renters have both the income and savings
needed to buy a typical starter home with a 10% down payment.</p>
<p>Greater Expectations</p>
<p>On Babies' Longevity</p>
<p>LIFE EXPECTANCY in the U.S. rose to a record high in 1989.</p>
<p>Last year's newborn can expect to live an average of 75.2
years, according to new estimates from Metropolitan Life.
This is up from a 1988 government estimate of 74.9 years.</p>
<p>Life expectancy at birth rose for both males and females,
although women still live nearly seven years longer than men,
on average. Girls born in 1989 can expect to live 78.6 years,
compared with 71.8 for boys.</p>
<p>And living through the perilous infant and young-adult
years pays off. Men who turned 55 last year can look forward
to another 22.3 years, to reach the ripe old age of 77.3.
Women who turned 55 last year can expect 26.8 more years,
living to the age of 81.8. Men and women who celebrated their
75th birthday in 1989 have an average of 10.9 years to go,
for an average life expectancy of 85.9 years.</p>
<p>Life expectancy for blacks continues to be lower than for
whites. Black males born in 1988 -- the latest government
estimate -- can expect to live 65 years, seven years less
than the life expectancy for white males. The gap is smaller
for black females. Their average life expectancy at birth is
74 years, five years less than for white females.</p>
<p>Babies have come a long way since the turn of the century,
when life expectancy for whites at birth was 48.2 years for
boys and 51.1 years for girls. But getting older has always
had its rewards. In 1900, white men at 85 could already
expect to live another 3.8 years. Nearly nine decades later,
85-year-old white men can expect just another five years.</p>
<p>Vietnam Veterans Work</p>
<p>As Often as Non-Vets</p>
<p>VIETNAM VETERANS are as likely as other men their age to
be working, unless they are disabled.</p>
<p>A supplement to a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey
co-sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs found five
million of the nearly eight million male Vietnam-era vets are
now ages 35 to 44. Of them, 95% are in the labor force, the
same rate as for non-veterans in that age group.</p>
<p>For the 2.5 million Vietnamera vets aged 35 to 44 who
served outside the Vietnam theater of operations, the rate is
even higher, 96%. For the 2.5 million men 35 to 44 who served
in Southeast Asia, 93% are in the labor force. The rate is
the same for vets who saw combat and those who didn't.</p>
<p>Work force rates are obviously lower for those with
disabilities. Only 68% of the 548,000 Vietnam vets with
service-connected disabilities are in the labor force,
ranging from 84% for those with minor disabilities to 27% for
those with major disabilities.</p>
<p>But these numbers, based on a survey of the civilian,
noninstitutional population, don't include institutionalized
veterans. Veterans Affairs people say the veteran population
in institutions is difficult to count, though probably small
enough that it doesn't affect the overall picture of the
veteran work force.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>JOB DISPLACEMENT is down, according to a Bureau of Labor
Statistics survey. About 4.3 million Americans who had been
with their employer for three or more years lost their jobs
between 1985 and 1990 because of plant closings, staff
reductions and related reasons. This is down from 5.1 million
workers with at least three years of tenure who were
displaced during the recessionary years in the first half of
the '80s. Two out of five displaced workers lost
manufacturing jobs in the late 1980s, and they were less
likely to be re-employed than those displaced in other
industries. . . . Four percent of Americans age 15 or older
need help performing at least one everyday activity because
of a health condition lasting three or more months. A new
Census Bureau study found that about 1% of adults need help
with just one of these five activities: doing housework,
fixing meals, managing money, getting around outside and
personal care. One percent need help with two activities; 2%
need help with three or more.</p>
