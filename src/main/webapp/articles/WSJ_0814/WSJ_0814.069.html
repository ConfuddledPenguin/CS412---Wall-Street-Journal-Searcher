	<h3>Economy: Cloudy Economic Outlook Turns Gloomier After Invasion of Kuwait --- More Forecasters in Survey, In a Quick Shift of Mood, Expect Recession in U.S.</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The guns of August suddenly have darkened the
economic skies.
   Even before Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait, storm
clouds threatened many sectors of the U.S. economy. But now,
with the Middle East in turmoil and oil prices sharply
higher, the U.S. appears headed for significantly higher
unemployment and little or no economic growth in the next
year, according to a survey of economists by The Wall Street
Journal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This view represents a startlingly swift mood swing from
the consensus forecast in a similar survey less than two
months ago. At midyear, 35 out of 40 economists surveyed by
the Journal predicted the economy would continue expanding
for at least another year. Now, only 19 out of 34 who updated
their midyear forecasts in response to a new Journal survey
predict another year without recession. And most of these
economists agree that hard times lie ahead.</p>
<p>"I don't think we will have a recession in the technical
sense, but that's a distinction without a difference," says
Neal Soss, a managing director at First Boston Corp. "You
will have to be a professional economist to tell the
difference. To businesses, households and people in the
financial markets, it certainly feels like a recession
already has arrived."</p>
<p>Joseph A. Wahed, senior vice president at Wells Fargo Bank
in San Francisco, agrees. "The argument of whether or not we
are in a recession is silly," he says. "The fact of the
matter is, business conditions are poor in most parts of the
country and will continue to be poor for at least the next
six months."</p>
<p>Add the threat of higher taxes, and the economy could be
headed for even stormier days. "You've got Bush and a bunch
of misguided people in Congress talking about raising taxes
just as the economy is tipping into the Hussein recession,"
says Lawrence Kudlow, a senior managing director at Bear
Stearns & Co. "It's bizarre. It's Hooveresque]"</p>
<p>Most forecasters who expect an economic slump predict it
will be "mild and short-lived," as Norman Robertson, senior
vice president of Mellon Bank, puts it. They predict that the
Federal Reserve will ease credit, reducing short-term
interest rates, as soon as clearer signs of recession appear.
Most also predict that interest rates will be lower by
mid-1991 than today, and many now are urging investors to buy
long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>But some analysts warn that any Fed action will be too
little and too late, and that an economic storm already has
begun.</p>
<p>"It is probably already too late for Fed easing to do more
than ameliorate the severity of the recession and its
inevitable pronounced economic and financial shakeout," says
Philip Braverman, senior vice president at DKB Securities.
"This could readily be the worst recession since the
Depression of the 1930s, considering the financial and
economic vulnerabilities imposed by massive debt burdens and
wideranging economic excesses."</p>
<p>Nearly everyone agrees that Saddam Hussein's march into
Kuwait altered their midyear economic forecasts considerably.
"It changed my views significantly, causing me to anticipate
more of a downturn than I had earlier expected, and more
inflation than I had earlier expected," says Irwin Kellner,
chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</p>
<p>Says Richard B. Hoey, chief economist in the U.S. for
Barclays de Zoete Wedd: "There are now increased odds that
the recession may not be mild."</p>
<p>A. Gary Shilling, head of a consulting firm bearing his
name, says that the slump began late last year and that it
will be anything but mild. He also repeats his midyear
forecast that the civilian unemployment rate, which stood at
5.5% in July, will soar to 8.9% by mid-1991. Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait "has made my earlier forecast more likely," Mr.
Shilling says.</p>
<p>Before Iraq's invasion, several sections of the nation
were mired in regional recession. The Northeast has been hit
especially hard, and the recent surge in oil prices appears
to be making the situation even worse.</p>
<p>"People really aren't spending money. They're scared,"
says Kathy Braddock, owner of Intrepid New Yorker, a
personalshopping and home services company in New York City.
"Everything really is dead -- the stores, the real estate
market, the home-refurbishing business. I have some clients
who wouldn't blink at spending $6,000 for very expensive
fabric in their bedrooms, but this year, they're asking me if
I can find them discount fabrics on Grand Street. So instead
of spending $6,000, maybe they're spending $800."</p>
<p>A few economists, such as Robert Barbera of Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., declined to participate in the latest
survey. They said economic forecasting is tough enough
without trying to make sense out of the swirl of events in
the Middle East.</p>
<p>But that didn't stop most of the panel from trying -- even
if many said their forecasts could change in a flash
depending on Saddam Hussein's latest whim. "Until the Mideast
sand stops blowing, forecasts will be made to be changed,"
says Robert Dederick, executive vice president at Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago.</p>
<p>"I'll give you my forecast, but I may have a new one
tomorrow," says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at
PrudentialBache Securities Inc. "I'm calling my latest one my
forecast de jour."</p>
<p>Here are details of the Journal's latest survey:</p>
<p>-- A Slower Economy.</p>
<p>The average forecast calls only a 0.3% rise in the gross
national product, adjusted for inflation, in this year's
second half, followed by a 1% increase in next year's first
half. These forecasts are down sharply from midyear, when the
consensus called for 1.6% growth in this year's second half
followed by 1.8% in next year's first half.</p>
<p>-- High Inflation.</p>
<p>The average forecast calls for consumer prices to rise at
a 5.4% annual rate in this year's second half. That is up
sharply from a midyear average forecast of only 4%. In next
year's first half, inflation is likely to run at a 4.3% pace.</p>
<p>-- Higher Unemployment.</p>
<p>The civilian unemployment rate, which was 5.5% in July, is
expected to rise to 5.8% in November and 6.1% next May.</p>
<p>-- Lower Interest Rates.</p>
<p>Yields on three-month Treasury bills, now about 7.65%,
will drop to 7.2% at year end and around 7% by mid-1991. The
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, now about 8.75%, will
decline to about 8.25% by year end and just under 8% by the
middle of next year.</p>
<p>--Steady Dollar against the Japanese yen. The dollar,
which now is worth about 150 Japanese yen, will buy 147 yen
at year end and 145 yen by mid-1991.</p>
