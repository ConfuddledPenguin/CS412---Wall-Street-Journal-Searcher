	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market rebounded from an early bout
of selling in slow trading, curtailed by an afternoon power
outage in the city's financial district.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 32 points
just after the opening in the wake of steep losses on
overseas stock markets, including Tokyo, where the Nikkei
index of 225 Japanese issues recorded one of its sharpest
declines ever.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But on Wall Street, prices gradually rebounded after the
initial wave of selling subsided, as a combination of
bargain-hunting and futures-related program buying lifted the
market. The Dow Jones industrials finished up 30.20 at
2746.78.</p>
<p>Broader market measures couldn't keep pace with the
industrial average, which benefited from renewed buying
interest in both oil stocks and blue-chip,
recession-resistant consumer issues.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index recorded the equivalent
of a 25-point advance in the Dow Jones industrials by rising
0.21 to 335.73, while the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index went up 1.48 to 185.63.</p>
<p>Declining issues outpaced advancers on the Big Board by
766 to 726. Volume was low, with 122,820,000 shares changing
hands, compared with 145,340,000 shares Friday. The latest
total was the lowest in five weeks. Traders attributed the
industrial average's early slide to nervousness about how the
market would react to the latest developments in the Middle
East. Mideast concern continued to take its toll on the Tokyo
market; the Nikkei Index of 225 issues plunged 1153.12, or
4.2%, to 26176.43. The drop was its fourth-largest point loss
and seventh-largest percentage drop on record.</p>
<p>But while New York stock prices tumbled at the start of
trading, "There was not an avalanche of sell orders, by any
means," said Sid Dorr, head of institutional trading at
Charles Schwab & Co., San Francisco. By midday, the
industrial average had erased its opening losses, and a round
of buying in the final hour of trading sent it up sharply.</p>
<p>The power outage struck lower Manhattan as the result of a
substation fire about noon EDT at a Consolidated Edison Co.
of New York plant.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange shut down its trading at 1:13
p.m. EDT after losing power to its systems, and outages
curtailed operations at a number of New York-based brokerage
firms. The New York Stock Exchange said the power problem
didn't close down its operations.</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak surged 2 1/2 to 43 1/2 in composite trading
of 1.5 million shares, and other blue-chip consumer stocks
attracted buyers as well. Merck climbed 2 1/8 to 86 7/8,
Procter & Gamble rose 1 7/8 to 81 3/4, Coca-Cola gained 3/4
to 44 1/2 and Philip Morris added 5/8 to 46 1/2 on volume of
1.4 million shares.</p>
<p>Energy stocks rallied along with the price of oil;
September crude-oil futures were up 54 cents a barrel, to
$26.77; dealings on the New York Mercantile Exchange were
halted because of power problems.</p>
<p>Exxon gained 3/4 to 52 3/8, Texaco added 3/8 to 63 1/2,
Mobil climbed 1 1/4 to 67 1/8, Amoco rose 3/4 to 56 1/2,
Unocal added 5/8 to 32 5/8 and Atlantic Richfield rallied 1
3/4 to 136 3/4. Du Pont, which owns Conoco, advanced 1 1/8 to
38 5/8.</p>
<p>The precious-metals sector, another strong performer
lately as a result of the turmoil in the Middle East, also
attracted market players as the price of gold rose above $400
an ounce. Even American Barrick Resources, which said it
planned to sell five million common shares for 24.50 Canadian
dollars each, added 1/2 to 22 3/8.</p>
<p>Among other gold stocks, Placer Dome rose 1 3/8 to 19 1/4
on 1.1 million shares, ASA Ltd. jumped 2 3/8 to 54 3/8,
Homestake Mining gained 1 1/8 to 23, Hecla Mining went up 1/2
to 12 3/4 and Battle Mountain Gold rose 3/8 to 13.</p>
<p>Stock in Midway Airlines, a Chicago-based carrier, rose 2
to 9 5/8 amid reports that AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit
has hired the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs & Co.
to study the possible purchase of part or all of Midway.</p>
<p>Multiple rounds of buy programs related to stock-index
arbitrage boosted the market in the final hour, traders said.
The arbitrage buying went into effect after index futures
rallied to sharp premiums to the cash indexes; the lack of
activity aside from the programs magnified the market impact
of the buying, traders said.</p>
<p>International Business Machines climbed 1 3/4 to 103 3/4
on 1.5 million shares as technology issues benefited from
bargain-hunting. Compaq Computer added 2 3/8 to 56 1/4,
Hewlett-Packard went up 1/2 to 38 1/4, Motorola gained 1 3/8
to 76 1/4 and Texas Instruments rose 3/4 to 28 7/8.</p>
<p>Japan OTC Equity Fund fell 5/8 to 9 7/8 in Big Board
trading following Tokyo's sell-off, and put warrants on the
Nikkei index -- a security which permits its holders to
profit when the measure drops -- rallied in the abbreviated
session on the American Stock Exchange. Salomon Inc.'s put
warrants gained 7/8 to 13 3/4 and led the American exchange's
most actives.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.32
to 338.00. Volume at the 1 p.m. closing totaled 9,480,000
shares.</p>
