	<p class="article-leader">MACCLESFIELD, England -- It's Wednesday, senior citizens'
discount day, and the B&Q do-it-yourself store in this
prosperous Manchester suburb fills quickly with older
shoppers.
   Up and down the long aisles of lawn mowers and pine
paneling, one sees almost nothing but gray-haired heads among
both customers and workers. Except for its manager, the huge
store is staffed entirely by people over 50 -- a phenomenon
unique in Britain and, perhaps, the world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You get far more satisfaction because {staff members}
know what they're talking about," says Ivan O'Dell, a
67-year-old retired banker busily shopping for a ladder. "You
get service, unlike from youngsters."</p>
<p>The store's opening last fall marked a watershed. Rampant
job bias against older Europeans is just starting to decline,
thanks to a scarcity of young people and the spread of
U.S.-style advocacy groups. Unlike America, Europe lacks
tough laws broadly barring age discrimination. Employers
routinely run advertisements seeking workers under 40, force
staffers as young as 55 to retire and fire people simply for
being too old.</p>
<p>Yet in recent months, more than a dozen U.K. retailers,
fast-food restaurants, hotel groups and government agencies
like Scotland Yard have started drives to attract older
employees or have raised age ceilings for entry-level
positions. Grocery chains in France and West Germany are also
mounting recruitment campaigns for "mature entrants."</p>
<p>The European Commission is waking up to the age-bias issue
as well. "It's a big thing at the moment. It's coming up all
over the place," says Eamon McInerney, an administrator who's
widening an EC action plan for the elderly to fund research
on how member nations fight discrimination against older
workers.</p>
<p>The commission's own hiring practices -- restricting many
professional jobs to those under 35 -- are also under fire.
The outcry comes primarily from Britain, where a
letter-writing drive has been organized by the U.K. offshoot
of the powerful American Association of Retired Persons.
Since retired U.S. property developer Robert Rose began that
group, he has gathered nearly 67,000 members and has
delivered petitions to the prime minister with 40,000 names
demanding an age-bias law. The group has also opened an older
workers' project with ECCO, a major French employment agency
that has 35 U.K. outlets.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Rose is setting his sights on the rest of Europe.
This fall, he will join forces with Le Temps Retrouve, a
French magazine with 400,000 older subscribers and dreams of
political activism. He wants to forge similar links with
retiree organizations in West Germany and Spain. The goal: a
loose federation to end age bias and represent the 100
million Western Europeans over 50. Even if a Europe-wide
alliance attracts only 10% of the total, he says, "you will
have a very strong political force."</p>
<p>At the moment, however, Mr. Rose's lobbying remains
focused on Britain because widespread age discrimination hits
people sooner here than anywhere else in Europe. That's
because of Britons' love affair with American youth culture
and an unflattering view of older people. Some want ads
request that sales representatives "ideally be aged 23 to 25
years." One youth-oriented magazine spurns applicants over
22. Even with top-management posts, "a lot of our employers
say they are looking for people aged 35 and no more --
because over 35 they're too old to train," says John Grumbar,
London managing partner of Egon Zehnder International,
executive recruiters.</p>
<p>U.K. units of American multinationals typically copy such
local practices, long outlawed at home. The British unit of
Ford Motor Co. didn't ban age-specific recruitment
advertising until November 1988, when the U.S. auto giant and
its unions negotiated an equal-opportunity policy covering
age bias.</p>
<p>Such policies are rare in corporate Britain, but age
barriers are tumbling among employers who are courting older
workers for vacancies. The number of Britons aged 16 to 20
will plummet by a third between 1989 and 1995, and a third of
the U.K. population will be more than 50 years old by the
year 2000.</p>
<p>"In the next two to three years, the less enlightened
companies will wake up to the demographic problem, and there
will be a mad scramble to recruit the mature entrant,"
predicts Barry Ball, a personnel executive at Tesco PLC. More
than 6,000 people aged 55 and over work for Tesco, a big U.K.
grocer, triple the number employed when its hiring push
commenced in the fall of 1988. Tesco has since opened
middle-management jobs in its 379 stores to the older
newcomers and has extended its mandatory retirement age to 70
from 65.</p>
<p>As many U.S. companies have realized, an investment in
mature recruits can pay off in lower turnover and absenteeism
as well as greater customer satisfaction. The Macclesfield
outlet "is a very successful store," says Jim Hodkinson,
chief executive of B&Q PLC, Britain's biggest
home-improvement chain. "We are getting our staff to talk to
customers by a factor three times more than anywhere else in
the country." Surveys show consumers like such frequent
interaction.</p>
<p>In fact, the store exceeded its sales goal during the 1990
first half by 40%. "We think that's partly due to the age
profile," Mr. Hodkinson says. The chain will open two other
outlets staffed solely with people over 50 by year-end.</p>
<p>Despite the idea's apparent success, B&Q executives are
still struggling to overcome their stereotypes about an older
work force. The chain trained its 54 Macclesfield employees
for two months, rather than the usual one. But most didn't
need the extra time.</p>
<p>It also added a special course on proper lifting
techniques. "We thought that might be a problem," recalls
Mike Harris, the 41-year-old picked as store manager because
older colleagues resisted relocation. No one has suffered a
back injury so far because workers usually pair up to carry
heavy items.</p>
<p>When a woman asks garden-center manager Ken Moss for a
60-liter bag of compost, for example, a white-haired salesman
rushes over to help. "He'll manage the 28 pounds," Mr. Moss
says. "That's light."</p>
<p>The garden-center boss is the store's best worker, Mr.
Harris says, but adds, "I worried about him looking a bit
old" at 57. The store manager deliberately hired a
youthful-looking staff and prefers candidates under 60. "I
didn't want {the store} to look like a bunch of old-age
pensioners," he explains. "Customers would have said, `I
won't go in there. It's just a bunch of geriatrics.'"</p>
<p>The CEO disagrees and says Mr. Harris suffers from culture
shock because he was used to hiring teen-agers. "There are a
lot of agile people at 70," Mr. Hodkinson argues. In fact, he
suggests, Mr. Harris's eventual successor may be a grand old
man of 60.</p>
