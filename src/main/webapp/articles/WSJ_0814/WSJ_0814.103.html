	<p class="article-leader">Warships glide and threats rattle in the Persian Gulf. The
wolf of recession may be at the door. What's an investor to
do?
   Hang onto most of your oil stocks, lighten up on some
other holdings, and don't let Mideast hostilities lure you
into defense issues. That's what research directors are
saying at several of the 10 big brokerage houses in a
continuing study by The Wall Street Journal and Zacks
Investment Research Inc. of Chicago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stocks are "still somewhat overvalued," even though the
Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen more than 200 points
since mid-July, says William Kealy, director of research at
Goldman, Sachs & Co. Since March, the firm has been
recommending that investors be "underexposed in equities."</p>
<p>Goldman is the leader in the Journal-Zacks study, which
attempts to assess how individual investors would do if they
followed the brokerage houses' stock-picking recommendations.
Investors who follow the advice of closely held Goldman have
gained an estimated 99.8% during the four years through June.
Goldman also led the field for the 12 months ended in June,
with an estimated gain of 23%.</p>
<p>While Mr. Kealy thinks investors should pare stock
holdings, he suggests keeping growth stocks with high market
shares and good product-development pipelines. Among those he
thinks fill the bill: Albertsons Inc., Abbott Laboratories,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Syntex Corp., Gillette Co. and
Philip Morris Cos.</p>
<p>Though oil stocks have had a sharp run-up in the past two
weeks, Goldman still recommends Kerr McGee Corp., Norsk Hydro
of Norway and Repsol S.A. of Spain. It expects oil's price to
level off at about $22 a barrel, down a few dollars from last
week's panic levels but up a few dollars from the price this
spring.</p>
<p>Manny Korman, research director at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., also likes energy stocks. In addition, he favors
recession-resistant stocks like drug, hospital supply,
hospital management, food, beverage and tobacco issues. Dean
Witter, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., isn't predicting a
recession, just "very slow growth." But Mr. Korman says he's
recommending basically the same stocks he would recommend in
a recession.</p>
<p>Dean Witter was the hottest firm in stock-picking during
the second quarter, the study shows. The stocks it
recommended jumped more than 12% in the quarter, led by Lowes
Cos., up 48%; Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., up 31%; and
First Brands Corp., up 31%. Other big winners were Eli Lilly
& Co., Humana Inc., and Boeing Co.</p>
<p>As for energy stocks, Mr. Korman notes that Dean Witter
liked them before the latest explosion in the Persian Gulf.
"Our three favorites, at current prices," he says, are
Texaco, Exxon Corp., and Dresser Industries Inc.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown on how the other eight firms are reacting
to Mideast events and what sorts of stocks they recommend
now. The firms are listed in order of the performance of
their recommendations in the 12 months through June 30.</p>
<p>SMITH BARNEY: "We've had cheap energy for about 10 years,"
but that's over, says Alan Benasuli, research director at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. Even if the Mideast calms
down, he thinks oil will settle at $23 to $24 a barrel. So,
Smith Barney, a unit of Primerica Corp., recommends energy
stocks like Grace Energy Corp., Mobil Corp. and Texaco Inc.
"We're staying away from anything that has to do with
transportation, like airlines," and also from refiners, he
says. Seeing "a very strong likelihood of a recession," Smith
Barney is adding utility stocks to its recommended list: They
tend to be steady, and pay high dividends.</p>
<p>SHEARSON LEHMAN: At fourth-ranked Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc., a unit of American Express Co., research director Fred
Fraenkel says it's still not too late to buy oil stocks.
"About a year ago, we foresaw a very bullish scenario for the
oils, based on the fact that demand bottomed in 1988," he
says. By 1995, Shearson thinks world demand for oil will
outrun the supply. The past two weeks' jump in oil-stock
prices, he says, "is not significant compared to the
long-term potential." Shearson also recommends selected
bargain-hunting among battered technology stocks.</p>
<p>PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: Short-term traders should sell oil
stocks because "they ran up too fast," says Michael Culp,
research director at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "We
still like quite a few (oil issues) on a 12- to 18-month
basis" though. Pru-Bache, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co.
of America, also likes health-care, pollution-control,
natural-gas, life-insurance and beverage stocks; it has
downgraded airlines. The unusual pick here is life insurance.
As the recession risk rises, Mr. Culp says people will be
looking for the sorts of conservative investments insurers
sell, like annuities and universal life.
</p>
<p>MERRILL LYNCH: At industry giant Merrill Lynch & Co.,
research director Andrew Melnick warns against "blindly
looking at energy" and urges bargain hunting among some
technology stocks like Compaq Computer Corp. "At certain
prices, there are values," he says. Merrill also thinks
health care stocks are a fertile prospecting ground, since
they tend to be recession-resistant. As for oil stocks,
"shorter term it is too late" to buy them. Longer term, we're
still comfortable with them. We'd be buying into selling,"
Mr. Melnick says.</p>
<p>KIDDER PEABODY: Extra oil pumping by Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Canada means "a worst-case scenario for the
price of oil -- $30 or higher -- is unlikely," says Stefan
Abrams, chief strategist for Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of
General Electric Co. "Energy stocks still have some merit,
particularly the oil-service stocks. But they will not
provide the multiyear leadership that occurred in the 1970s."
He says investors should look for growth stocks with an
international presence, such as Abbott Laboratories,
Bristol-Myers Co., Schering Plough Corp., Procter & Gamble
Co., Gillette, Philip Morris, and Anheuser Busch Co.</p>
<p>PAINEWEBBER: "Our stock-picking has not changed
materially, partly because we had quite a number of oil and
oil-service stocks in our top-rated category" before Iraq
invaded Kuwait, says James Voytko, research director at
PaineWebber Inc. "In a state of such extreme flux, I'm not
sure you do your clients a great service by whipping them in
and out of stocks." Because the U.S. economy was "rapidly
slowing" even before this latest shock, he recommends stocks
of companies "that are competitive globally," such as
Motorola Inc., Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., International
Flavors & Fragrances Inc., and CPC International Inc.</p>
<p>A.G. EDWARDS: "We're looking for slow growth, with the
possibility of dipping into a recession for a brief period,"
says Terry Dessent, research director A.G. Edwards & Sons
Inc. in St. Louis. He thinks people who already own such
"classical defensive" stocks as pharmaceutical and food
companies should hang onto them. But he doesn't recommend
that new buyers pile in: "Valuations are very high," because
buyers have been hedging against a recession for a while. As
for oil stocks, he likes Texaco and Chevron Corp. but
cautions against buying oil issues "en masse." Selected
technology stocks may be bargains, he says.</p>
<p>RAYMOND JAMES: Raymond, James & Associates, based in St.
Petersburg, Fla., ranks third for the long term, but has
slumped lately. It covers a smaller range of stocks than
competitors do, and has no coverage of oil stocks. It has
emphasized leisure issues, which were hurt in the second
quarter by news of a slowing economy and by subpar results
for Atlantic City casinos. With the additional blow of rising
oil prices (and hence rising travel costs), it has cut back
on its recommendations in the leisure area, but still
suggests investors buy Aztar, Bally Manufacturing Corp.,
Chart House Enterprises Inc. and International Game
Technology.</p>
