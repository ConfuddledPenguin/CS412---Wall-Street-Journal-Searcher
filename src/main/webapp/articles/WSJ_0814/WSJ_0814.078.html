	<p class="article-leader">ANKARA, Turkey -- A few hours after Iraq invaded Kuwait,
Turkish President Turgut Ozal broke off his vacation on
Turkey's Mediterranean coast and spoke by telephone to the
leaders of Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Canada and the
U.S., as well as the deposed emir of Kuwait.
   That Mr. Ozal's telephone log during a crisis often
resembles a United Nations roll call is no fluke: Turkey and
its ebullient 62-year-old president more often than not find
themselves smack in the middle on strategic planners' maps.
The Iraqi crisis is just the latest example: Turkey is within
missile range of eastern neighbors Iraq, Iran and Syria. But
Turkey has in the past, and will in the future, come under
pressure from the west and north, too.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It fights with neighbor Greece over Cyprus and other
islands. It quarrels with Bulgaria from time to time. For
now, at least, its most open and peaceful border is the one
that was most tense a year ago: a long stretch along the
Soviet Union's southern flank. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization listening posts and military bases that kept
track of Soviet activity are now a valuable means of
monitoring and reacting to the Iraq crisis.</p>
<p>East-West tensions may have cooled, but the Middle East
crisis puts Turkey back in the middle. And this time Mr. Ozal
is determined to harvest all the long-term benefit he can. By
taking actions that not only back the U.S. and Western
Europe, but also support Saudi Arabia and other conservative
Gulf states, Mr. Ozal is extracting economic and political
concessions in return for his cooperation.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal's callers asked him to make a painful and risky
decision to shut off two pipelines that carry half of Iraq's
oil exports across Turkey to a Mediterranean tanker terminal.
It took him only two hours to decide, last Tuesday, to shut
off the oil, thus giving a vital early boost to anti-Iraq
sanctions. In return, Turkey wants an economic and military
cushion against fallout from this decision, and a much more
elusive payoff: international respect and membership in the
European Community.</p>
<p>In an interview Saturday in his large office in Ankara's
Presidential Palace, a jaunty but tired-looking Mr. Ozal says
he decided to shut the pipeline "on principle: to go to a
country and make them accept your conditions by force (as
Iraq did to Kuwait). This cannot be accepted."</p>
<p>Because of that decision Turkey now has a chance to get
what it has lacked for many, many decades: attention, and a
place in Europe. It has already started. Mr. Ozal was
delighted that President Bush called him a "staunch friend of
the United States" during the president's televised
announcement that he was sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Ozal was also flattered that Secretary of State James
Baker came here first before going on to the NATO meeting in
Brussels on Friday. In talks with reporters at that session,
Mr. Baker and NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner
mentioned five times that NATO would spring to Turkey's aid
if it was attacked.</p>
<p>Attention brings leverage. Mr. Ozal trumpets Turkey's
response to the crisis as proof of its political maturity and
its adherence to Western values as a means of pressuring the
European Community into accepting Turkey as a member. "This
crisis gives the opportunity to show that Turkey is a very
important country for Europe," Mr. Ozal says.</p>
<p>"Turkey is a very important country," he continues. "A
free-market country. A modern country. A democratic country.
And we are also a Moslem country." With a population 98%
Moslem, and a land area 97% in Asia, Mr. Ozal's boldest move
was to apply for membership in the EC in 1987, posing Western
Europe a problem; Turkey's formal application to join has
been effectively shelved.</p>
<p>"Although they won't say it out loud," Mr. Ozal says, "the
EC won't consider us for membership because of our Moslem
identity. But this incident in the Gulf should show that
tension in the future won't be communism against capitalism.
Instead there will be tension between Christianity and Islam,
dangerous for the whole world. Turkey has a lot of influence
in the Islamic world, so Turkey in the EC would help avoid
dangerous incidents. We're a bridge."</p>
<p>When asked if he thinks this argument will really help get
Turkey into the EC, Mr. Ozal shrugs, then laughs. "No, I
don't. But this is my argument."</p>
<p>Both the way the pipeline decision was taken and the way
he is now attempting to exploit it are typical of Turgut
Ozal's style. For 10 years the former international economic
official has played a high-risk game with the Turkish
economy, betting that the free market could create enough
wealth fast enough to satisfy a burgeoning population in one
of Europe's poorest countries. Even though his austerity
program alienated many voters, he managed to move from the
prime minister's to the president's office, taking the power
with him.</p>
<p>His economic reforms, so far only partly successful, must
complete Turkey's transformation lest Islamic fundamentalism
or old-style political anarchy return. Following a period of
military rule, Mr. Ozal has mastered Turkey's chaotic
political system by amassing nearly all political and
economic power in his own hands. When he was prime minister
he ran Turkey nearly alone; after being elected president
last November by a parliament dominated by members of the
Motherland Party, which he founded, he appointed a loyal but
ineffective prime minister. Mr. Ozal continues to run Turkey.</p>
<p>Political cartoons usually show the short, stocky, Mr.
Ozal dressed in flowing Sultan's robes. Like his Ottoman
predecessors he travels with a retinue, taking a dozen
cabinet ministers with him on a foreign trip, or hauling two
dozen businessmen with him to international conferences.
Political opponents say his family has too much influence on
Turkish affairs. His brother Korkut has close economic ties
with Saudi Arabia. Another brother and a cousin work for the
government, and his wife Semra, is said to have more
influence on her husband than his ministers.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal exudes a confidence that borders on cockiness. He
has been known to inspect a spit-and-polish army unit while
wearing jeans and a tee-shirt. When attacked in print he is
quick to sue for libel, and usually wins. When people are
sometimes jailed for insulting the president, a crime under
Turkey's constitution, Mr. Ozal can be slow to pardon them.</p>
<p>As is now normal in Turkey, neither the opposition nor the
parliament was consulted before Mr. Ozal shut off Iraq's oil.
Erdal Inonu, chief of the main opposition Social Democratic
Populist Party, says, "Mr. Ozal is mixing up moves to raise
the reputation of the government with self-advertisement."</p>
<p>Not so, says Mr. Ozal, who explains his calculations. On
the minus side, shutting the pipeline will cost Turkey
perhaps $2.5 billion in lost revenue, fees, and debt payments
from Iraq, and some political capital among hard-line Shiite
Moslems. Higher oil prices raise the risk of reigniting
inflation that his austerity measures had painfully shaved to
56% from last year's 75% rate. Participating in the sanctions
also opens Turkey to the threat of military reprisals from
unpredictable Iraq, not to mention the possible loss of more
than $2 billion in annual trade.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the crisis has brought Turkey an
unequivocal reaffirmation of NATO's willingness to defend
Turkey against any attack. In return for his action on
sanctions and promises to let U.S. fighter planes use Turkish
airbases in the event of war, Mr. Ozal extracted from Mr.
Baker promises to compensate Turkey, largely from Kuwaiti
assets held outside the country, for any financial impact;
more economic and defense aid; and help in raising U.S.
import quotas for Turkish textiles.</p>
<p>Although he says it didn't come up directly with Mr.
Baker, Mr. Ozal says Turkey would like to see the U.S. Senate
shelve forever a recently defeated bill sponsored by
Republican Sen. Robert Dole blaming Turkey for the 1910
massacre of Armenians, and would like Congress to drop its
ratio of giving Greece $7 in aid for every $10 it gives
Turkey. In addition, Mr. Ozal says Mr. Baker agreed to give a
diplomatic push to Turkey's EC application.</p>
<p>Officials in Brussels say they aren't deaf to Mr. Ozal's
arguments, and say the pipeline shutdown will help as it
tries to get into the EC. But they also say Turkey's economic
problems, as well as alleged human rights abuses and its
shaky political system leave it too far out of step with the
rest of the EC to allow early entry. Most Eastern European
countries are expected to join before Turkey, which Mr. Ozal
finds exasperating.</p>
