	<p class="article-leader">Two of the country's weakest airlines, bucking the
industry trend, pared many of their fares for travel during
the slow fall and winter seasons. It's unclear whether rivals
will follow suit.
   The pricing moves by Trans World Airlines and Eastern
Airlines were viewed by industry analysts as marketing ploys
to drum up business. But TWA said it was "responding to
President Bush's call" last week for companies to restrain
prices amid a run-up in the cost of fuel. TWA said it was
cutting some fares by 20% to 30%. And Eastern said the new
fares, which it said are discounted 15% to 40%, represent a
"beat-the-increase" program before higher fares go into
effect tomorrow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"What generous guys," said Robert Cross, president of
Aeronomics Inc., an airline pricing consulting firm. "It
seems like a real magnanimous thing to do. But airlines
respond to the demands of the traffic place, not necessarily
the chief executive of the country."</p>
<p>Eastern has been vigorously attempting to regain
passengers lost after a bitter strike crippled its operations
last year. TWA, meanwhile, faces problems that have prompted
owner Carl Icahn to sell planes, reduce the number of flights
and demand wage concessions from pilots.</p>
<p>The airline industry has come under increasing criticism
for raising prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait, sending oil
prices skyward. Initially, the industry averted criticism,
citing increases of as much as 35% in fuel prices.</p>
<p>But after several oil companies responded to President
Bush's jaw-boning by cutting or freezing gasoline prices,
most airlines plowed ahead with fare boosts.</p>
<p>Rep. Bob Carr (D., Mich.), a member of the House aviation
subcommittee, said the fuel increases "smacked of
profiteering" and suggested that airlines "avoid the
temptation to exploit the situation." Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner plans to meet starting tomorrow with
chief executive officers of several airlines in one-on-one
sessions to discuss, among other things, the impact of the
fuel increases on the flying public.</p>
<p>Not all Eastern passengers will receive lower fares.
Indeed, the airline will join other carriers and boost most
fares by 5.3% tomorrow. The lower fares announced yesterday
are a separate short-term promotion that will include several
restrictions.</p>
<p>For qualified fliers, Miami-based Eastern is cutting
round-trip fares to between $138 and $278. For instance, the
cheapest fare available from New York to Florida cities will
be $158 round-trip, down from $198 currently.</p>
<p>TWA, Mount Kisco, N.Y., said it reserves the right to
raise its fares in the future if fuel costs don't fall. Its
reluctance might not matter because its competitors can
institute their fare increases in all markets except where
TWA flies. Illustrating its fare reductions, TWA said the
cheapest round-trip fare between St. Louis and New York is
dropping to $158 from $280.</p>
<p>"We're trying to catch the mood in the country," said
Robert Cozzi, TWA's senior vice president, marketing. "People
are really upset" at higher fares.</p>
<p>The two airlines' competitors may follow the cuts for
several reasons. One, the lower fares are only available for
a short time, until Aug. 29. The cuts also don't affect all
tickets. They, for instance, exclude business fares that
generate the most revenue for airlines. The fare cuts affect
tickets that are mostly used by vacation travelers because
they can comply with the tight restrictions, which require
advance purchase, round-trip travel and Saturday night
stayovers.</p>
<p>Also, the discounted fares are only good for travel during
the slow Sept. 5 to Dec. 16 period, when vacationing
virtually comes to a standstill. Cutting those fares won't
hurt the airlines too badly.</p>
<p>Most important, the industry is in the midst of a
difficult time and can't afford to scare too many passengers
away. "We thought we'd go out and stimulate some business and
allay some fears people have," said George Brennan, Eastern's
senior vice president, marketing.</p>
<p>In a move underscoring the industry's current financial
troubles, the pilots' union at USAir Group Inc. said the
airline plans to lay off 211 pilots. Arlington, Va.-based
USAir denied that any such action has been announced but
acknowledged business is slow and that it is mulling the
move.</p>
