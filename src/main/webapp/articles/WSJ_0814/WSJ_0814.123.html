	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. ECONOMY appears headed for significantly higher
unemployment and little or no growth in the next year,
according to a survey of economists conducted by The Wall
Street Journal since the Mideast crisis began. The consensus
represents a swift change of mood from a similar survey less
than two months ago, when most economists predicted a
continuing expansion. The economists still disagree, however,
about whether a recession lies ahead.

600,000 barrels a day, in response to the tightening world

pre-embargo output, is enough to meet the nation's internal
needs plus a trickle of exports bypassing the near blockade,
mainly via trucks through Jordan.</p>

decision.</p>
