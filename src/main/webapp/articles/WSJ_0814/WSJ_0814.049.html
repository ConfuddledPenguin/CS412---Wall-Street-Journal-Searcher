	<p class="article-leader">The news from Pakistan in the wake of Benazir Bhutto's
ousting is disturbing. Citing "corruption and nepotism in the
federal government," military-backed President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan dissolved Ms. Bhutto's government last week, appointed
an interim prime minister and set new elections for October
24.
   Though the claims of "corruption" and "nepotism" on Ms.
Bhutto's watch are certainly well-founded, the recent
activities undertaken by the Pakistani security forces have
themselves advanced beyond legitimacy, or so it would appear.
The result is harassment of not only those associated with
Ms. Bhutto, but a crackdown on any dissent in the country.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The police have started to round up many of Ms. Bhutto's
key associates and supporters. Ms. Bhutto's mother was
harassed by security forces when she tried to leave the
country on a plane to London. A newspaper executive and four
senior journalists were arrested last Saturday. By some
lights, the country is in a virtual state of martial law.</p>
<p>Interim Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi has denied
that the arrests are political. But one can't help feeling
unease about the current weeding out of "corruption" and the
imposition of "order" in Pakistan. The Pakistani military,
despite its denials of involvement, seems to be the invisible
force behind Ms. Bhutto's ouster and the subsequent crackdown
on her supporters.</p>
<p>Under the rubric of ridding the government of corruption,
the military had taken over Pakistan's government five times
before the dissolution of the Bhutto government. Ms. Bhutto
said right after the announcement of this recent dissolution,
"They have done it again."</p>
<p>The military is miffed over Ms. Bhutto's meddling in its
"internal affairs," her handling of the ethnic strife in
Sind, and her search for a political solution in Afghanistan.
But while there can be legitimate complaints about her
policies and her management of government, Pakistan's voters
are entitled to decide for themselves whether she continues
or, if not, who her replacement will be. It is going to be
hard for anyone to regard the coming election as a fair one
if the contenders continue to be subject to arrest and
intimidation by the security forces. Indeed, the arrests and
proposed trials of prominent Bhutto backers will themselves
be suspect if they come to be regarded as political arrests
rather than actions based on genuine evidence of corruption.
That will hardly serve either the cause of democracy or
justice.</p>
<p>This ouster seems to have been done "by the book," or
pursuant to the Pakistani constitution, though there might be
grounds for challenging President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's actions
in court -- a course of action Ms. Bhutto reportedly will
take. The Pakistani courts and the political arena -- when
new elections are finally held -- are the forums in which
Pakistan's problems should be worked out. The laws of the
land and the voice of the Pakistani people -- not the
imposition of the military's will -- are the only legitimate
means to the ultimate end, which is the salvation of
Pakistan's fragile democracy.</p>
<p>Pakistan's problems are many, to be sure, involving not
only bad government management but dangers of serious
conflicts pitting Islamic fundamentalists in rural areas
against more sophisticated urban dwellers. But those problems
can only be solved through democratic processes, not by
strong-arm actions.</p>
