	<p class="article-leader">Greyhound Lines Inc. implemented a 2% across-the-board
fare increase to compensate for higher fuel costs.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the cost of fuel
to the Dallas-based passenger line rose almost 35% over the
first nine days of August, from 59 cents a gallon (pre-tax)
to 79 cents. Since then, the price has gone down a percentage
point or two, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fuel accounts for 4.6% of costs at Greyhound. "That's a
lot less than at American Airlines," Mr. Gravley said. The
airline increased its fares 10% last week.</p>
