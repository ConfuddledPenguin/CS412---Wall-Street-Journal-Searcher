	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- MinVen Gold Corp. said it will stop its gold and
silver mining operations at the Blackdome Mine in British
Columbia, Canada, late in the fourth quarter.
   The mining company wrote off its investment in Blackdome
in the first quarter due to a significant decline in the
grade of ore at the mine. An additional vein of higher grade
ore was discovered since then, but that will also be mined
out by November 1990, the company said.</p>
