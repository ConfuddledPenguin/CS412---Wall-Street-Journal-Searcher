	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said its
new credit card ranks eighth in the country, with revenue of
$750 million after 140 days in operation.
   In addition, the company and its partner, Universal Bank,
a unit of Columbus, Ga.-based Synovus Financial Corp., said
they have begun offering a gold MasterCard version of the
AT&T Universal card, which is available as either a Visa card
or MasterCard.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since its introduction on March 26, the Universal card has
garnered 2.7 million accounts and 4.6 million cardholders,
according to AT&T Universal Card Services Corp., the AT&T
unit that issues the card.</p>
<p>Moreover, AT&T said more than 11 million long-distance
calls and purchases have been made using the card, for a
total of $750 million in transactions.</p>
<p>AT&T announced its millionth account on June 12, 78 days
after launching the card. Since then it has signed another
1.7 million accounts.</p>
<p>That comes to about 27,000 cards per day. If this rate
holds, AT&T by this time next year could have more than 12
million accounts, making it the second-largest credit card
issuer in the country. Moreover, annual revenue could top $3
billion. An AT&T spokesman declined to make a prediction
about the card's future prospects.</p>
<p>"Our continuing success in the marketplace is a sign that
consumers are delighted with the advantages offered by the
AT&T Universal Card," said Paul G. Kahn, president of AT&T
Universal, in a statement.</p>
<p>His competitors aren't delighted, however. Several major
banks, including Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., have
filed lawsuits, challenging the legality of AT&T's card.</p>
<p>AT&T is offering the Universal card free for life to
consumers who sign up in 1990 and use it at least once a
year. It is also offering discounts on long-distance calls
made with the card and assorted warranties and service
guarantees.</p>
<p>AT&T said it derived its ranking from figures provided by
Credit Card News, a Chicago-based newsletter.</p>
