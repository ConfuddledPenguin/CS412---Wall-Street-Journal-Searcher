	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has signed
an agreement with Japan's international communications
carrier and the telecommunications authority of China to
upgrade China's international communications system.
   The agreement, with Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa and the
Directorate General of Telecommunications of China's Ministry
of Posts and Telecommunications, calls for the partners to
build a new system -- including a satellite earth station
network and the first undersea fiber-optic cable to China --
in two phases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first phase, to be completed by next year, a
network of satellite earth stations will be built providing
digital voice and data communications services to major
office buildings in Beijing and Shanghai. Satellites of the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or
Intelsat, will tie the network together.</p>
<p>The second phase, which is scheduled to be built and
operating in 1993, is a 800-mile, digital fiber-optic
submarine cable that will link Japan's Kyushu Island and the
Chinese coast near Shanghai. The cable is expected to carry
about 35,000 phone calls simultaneously, "a significant
expansion over the existing system," according to an AT&T
spokesman, who declined to provide further details.</p>
<p>William B. Carter, AT&T's executive director of submarine
systems, said the China system will provide one of the last
major links in a digital communications system encircling the
globe. He said equipment suppliers for the systems haven't
been chosen, but said the project should cost between $20
million and $45 million.</p>
