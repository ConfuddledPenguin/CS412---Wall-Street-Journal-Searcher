	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded credit
ratings of two of Japan's biggest banks, citing their high
exposure to Japan's real estate market and vulnerability to
rising interest rates.
   The New York-based rating concern lowered the long-term
debt of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd. to
double-A-1 from triple-A. Moody's retained the Prime-1 rating
on the two banks' short-term debt. Moody's earlier announced
it was considering a downgrading of the two banks' debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In taking its action, Moody's focused on the high
overheads and slow pace of adaptation to changing market
conditions at the two banks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo is the world's
largest bank, with $421 billion in assets, and Fuji, with
$392 billion, is the fourth biggest.</p>
<p>Interest rates in Japan have been moving up rapidly this
year, raising the cost of funds at the banks, and both
companies have large amounts of real estate loans outstanding
in Japan. Land prices in Japan, which have doubled in the
past five years, are considered inflated by many analysts.</p>
<p>"The issue is core profitability," said Roger B. Arner,
Moody's representative director in Japan. "This is
significant in that it's a further differentiation among the
large commercial banks. These banks are less able to
compete."</p>
<p>The banks objected to Moody's credit-rating revision. "We
highly regret this decision, which we believe does not
accurately reflect the bank's state of affairs," a
spokeswoman for Dai-Ichi Kangyo said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Fuji Bank said the bank wasn't happy with
the revision. He said Fuji would issue a statement later.</p>
<p>Moody's Mr. Arner played down the importance of the lower
ratings to the fund-raising abilities of Dai-Ichi Kangyo and
Fuji. "These are still very high ratings," he said.</p>
