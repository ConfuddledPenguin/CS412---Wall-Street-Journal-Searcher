	<p class="article-leader">LANGHORN, Pa. -- Ecogen Inc. said it closed an $8.5
million investment by David Blech, a private investor who
controls about 40% of the company's common stock. Ecogen has
received $7.6 million of the proceeds and the balance is
anticipated following stockholder approval of the issuance of
450,000 shares of common stock next month.
   The company said the investment will allow Ecogen to
continue operating as an independent company and to promote
its three new biopesticides.</p>
