	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Saudi Arabia turned away a tanker attempting
to load Iraqi crude oil, the surest sign yet that the Saudis
have shut down the export of Iraqi oil through a big pipeline
that crosses Saudi territory.
   The refusal to load the Iraqi tanker, reported by oil
industry sources and confirmed by U.S. officials, indicates
that the use of a naval blockade led by the U.S. won't be
needed for now to halt the flow of Iraqi oil from one of its
major export points at the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbu. The
U.S. and Britain have said they are ready to begin using
warships to block ships carrying Iraqi oil, but some other
nations are voicing reservations about a blockade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Saudi Arabia's action also appears to reflect political
resolve by its government to enforce a United
Nations-sponsored trade embargo imposed against Iraq for the
invasion of Kuwait. U.S. officials were watching the tanker
closely for several days near Yanbu. They feared that if the
tanker had been loaded and had attempted to leave, it could
have forced a military move by the U.S. Navy and opened the
way for deeper hostilities with Iraq.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. officials said the threat of an Iraqi
military move beyond Kuwait to Saudi Arabia persists, despite
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's weekend proposal of a
diplomatic initiative to reverse his occupation of Kuwait.
Iraq now has about 150,000 troops in Kuwait, the Pentagon
said, up from its earlier estimate of 120,000. The troops
"appear to be digging in" but remain capable of going on the
offensive on short notice, State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said.</p>
<p>Pakistan said it will send troops to Saudi Arabia to join
U.S., British, Egyptian, Moroccan and Syrian forces. The
addition of Pakistan to the force is politically significant,
because Pakistan is a Moslem nation, and the Saudi
government, guardian of Islam's most holy sites, is sensitive
to charges of turning over defense of the nation to
non-Moslems.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Richard Cheney will
travel to Saudi Arabia to visit the U.S. soldiers and may
stop in other gulf nations.</p>
<p>Concern is growing in the Pentagon about the cost of the
huge U.S. military operation, and officials said the Bush
administration plans to seek supplemental funding from
Congress to cover it.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Kuwait's
exiled government has asked all five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council to help enforce a trade embargo against
Iraq. Along with the U.S., the permanent members are the
Soviet Union, China, France and Britain.</p>
<p>But reports from Paris said that France, which has sent
warships to the region, won't participate in a naval blockade
of shipments to and from Iraq, arguing that by stopping ships
it would become a "co-belligerent" in the Persian Gulf
conflict.</p>
<p>The Bush administration, when it received a request from
Kuwaiti leaders, said it would begin stopping shipping to and
from Iraq. Administration spokesmen said the interdiction
would apply to oil shipments leaving Iraq and shipments of
food and other goods entering the nation. Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams said officials were drawing up general orders
for an effort designed to prevent ships from reaching Iraq.</p>
<p>Enforcing the sanctions will be far easier if Turkey and
Saudi Arabia don't allow oil through two pipelines that carry
Iraqi crude to ports for loading on tankers. The pipeline
across Saudi Arabia can carry 1.5 million barrels a day,
though it had been shippping only about 800,000 barrels,
financial sources said. The pipeline crossing Turkey to the
Mediterranean Sea has a capacity of about 1.8 million barrels
a day and had been carrying about 1.7 million barrels before
Turkey blocked the flow of Iraqi oil last week. In addition,
Iraq had been shipping 300,000 to 400,000 barrels daily
through the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>But one Iraqi lifeline may remain open. A small amount of
Iraqi oil also is exported through a pipeline to Jordan, and
some is trucked to the Jordanian port of Aqaba for export.
Reports from Jordan said the Jordanian pipeline remains open.
And perhaps more important, there were reports that Jordan
would allow shipments of food and other goods destined for
Iraq to be unloaded at Aqaba for shipment to Iraq by truck.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the Saudis indicated they refused to
load the Iraqi tanker by not sending tugboats to guide it
into port. The Saudis didn't announce that the tanker had
been turned away, and the State Department's Ms. Tutwiler
said the U.S. would let the Saudis "speak for themselves" in
explaining why it wasn't filled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration is beginning to come to
terms with the cost of its military operation. President Bush
plans to return to Washington from his vacation home in Maine
for meetings today and tomorrow, and among the issues he will
address is how the gulf crisis affects the administration's
position in budget negotiations with Congress. Both the
unanticipated costs of the gulf operation and slower economic
growth resulting from higher oil prices will affect the
administration's budget plans.</p>
<p>The administration earlier declared that because of the
gulf crisis, parts of the Pentagon budget will be excluded
from any budget cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.</p>
<p>The ultimate cost of the U.S. military operation -- and
who will pay for it -- is one of the thorniest issues facing
the White House and the Pentagon. Preliminary estimates peg
the Pentagon's cost at a minimum of $3 billion, if the crisis
continues for just a few months. Some independent estimates
put the monthly cost at $300 million.</p>
<p>As a first step to cover the cost, Mr. Bush may announce
this week that he will seek additional appropriations from
Congress. A Pentagon official said the department's
legislative office was notified that the White House will ask
for "significant additional appropriations," but officials
didn't provide details.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the price tag could skyrocket if
fighting breaks out or if there is a long standoff between
U.S. and Iraqi forces, Pentagon officials said the U.S. is
urging Saudi Arabia to pick up some of the cost. The Saudis
"have indicated a general willingness to work out a
compromise," said a military official familiar with the
issue. There also is likely to be pressure in the U.S. to
force Japan, more dependent than the U.S. on Persian Gulf
oil, to pick up a big share of the tab.</p>
<p>As part of the same talks, U.S. and Saudi military
officials are discussing how to set up a coordinated chain of
command for the force in Saudi Arabia. The fact that troops
from different nations are involved raises questions of
national pride, along with practical questions about how to
communicate with officers and troops who speak different
languages.</p>
<p>According to Pentagon officials, they haven't reached any
decisions with the Saudis about the cost-sharing or command
issues.</p>
