	<p class="article-leader">MINEOLA, N.Y. -- Robeson Industries Corp. said it agreed
to sell as much as 50.1% of its common stock outstanding to a
subsidiary of General Electronics Ltd., Hong Kong.
   Carl Singer, chairman of Robeson, said the deal should
alleviate a cash squeeze brought on by the company's
restructuring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The restructuring decimated the company's working capital
to the point that we needed additional capital," Mr. Singer
said. An earlier agreement to sell a 30% interest to a
Japanese consumer electronics distributor fell through.</p>
<p>The General Electronics subsidiary, General Electronics
(Overseas) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company, agreed to
purchase $750,000 of newly issued Robeson common stock and
assume a $500,000 three-year interest-free promissory note
issued by Robeson, which is convertible into Robeson common.
General Electronics will also receive a one-year warrant to
buy an additional $750,000 of Robeson common.</p>
<p>If General Electronics converts the note and exercises the
warrant, it will hold a majority interest in Robeson. The
agreement, however, entitles it to nominate only two of the
seven members of Robeson's board.</p>
<p>Mr. Singer said that he has been closing down Robeson's
U.S. manufacturing facilities and focusing on marketing a
broad line of kitchen appliances, household fans and heaters,
much of it through its Hong Kong outpost.</p>
<p>He said Robeson expects to report a profit in the next
quarter, its first in more than three years, but didn't
specify the amount. He projects sales of $35 million to $37
million in 1990, down from $42 million last year.</p>
