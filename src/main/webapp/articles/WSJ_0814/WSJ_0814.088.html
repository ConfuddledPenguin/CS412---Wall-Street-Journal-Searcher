	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Teamsters union members, spurning the
recommendation of their leadership, solidly ratified a new
labor agreement proposed by United Parcel Service of America
Inc.
   Teamsters President William McCarthy asserted that the big
package-delivery company pressured employees by threatening
that they would lose their jobs if there were a strike.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Baltimore, Louis D'Amico, National Labor Relations
Board regional director, said the NLRB is investigating
charges of unfair labor practices against the company filed
by the Teamsters UPS negotiating committee and also by
members of a dissident union group, Teamsters for a
Democratic Union.</p>
<p>The voter turnout was high. The Teamsters said they
counted 118,554 ballots from the 146,000 union members who
work for UPS. There were 65,463 votes for the contract and
53,091 against, the union said.</p>
<p>The new three-year contract replaces one that expired Aug.
1 but was extended while the Teamsters counted ratification
ballots.</p>
<p>At the request of federal mediators, UPS and the union had
agreed to keep negotiating regardless of how the vote turned
out. As a result, said Frank DePirro, a TDU official, many
UPS employees feel they were "tricked," because they were
afraid that a "no" vote would mean a strike and could also
mean they'd lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Mr. DePirro said UPS ran a "well-organized" campaign for
ratification, including pre-work meetings, after-work
barbecues and one-on-one sessions with employees. In their
charges before the NLRB, about 20 TDU and Teamsters members
alleged that UPS sought to intimidate employees who wanted to
post material opposing the contract, threatening them with
loss of work or benefits.</p>
<p>In separate charges filed with the NLRB, the Teamsters UPS
negotiators alleged that the company used coercive tactics.
The union contended that the company didn't bargain in good
faith, and that it held unlawful mandatory meetings in which
it intimidated employees who might vote against the company's
offer.</p>
<p>The union also said UPS warned that if its offer were
rejected, employees would lose their jobs in a strike or that
their facility would close. UPS also said that it wouldn't
return to the bargaining table if the contract were rejected,
the Teamsters alleged.</p>
<p>The NLRB's Mr. D'Amico said that whatever the outcome of
the agency's investigation, he wouldn't expect the case,
which could take two years, would have any effect on the
vote, itself.</p>
<p>The contract offer ratified by the Teamsters members was
the second one made by UPS. It included wage increases of 50
cents an hour, or about 3%, each year of the three-year pact;
cost-of-living rises capped at 20 cents an hour in the second
and third years; signing bonuses; a new, lower wage tier in
the UPS schedule of reduced pay levels for new employees, and
an employer contribution totaling 35 cents an hour into the
UPS health and welfare fund and the pension fund.</p>
