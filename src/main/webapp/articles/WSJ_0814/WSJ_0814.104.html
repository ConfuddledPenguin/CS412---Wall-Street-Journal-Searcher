	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Precision Mecanique Labinal S.A. reported
yesterday that its consolidated revenue for the first half of
1990 rose to 3.832 billion francs ($718 million) for a 9%
gain from the year-earlier total of 3.512 billion francs.
   The engineering group said in a communique that the sales
gain was led by the firm tone of civil aviation and
automobile cable markets. These elements were partly offset,
however, by weakness in the computer and military aviation
sectors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Labinal underlined that part of its first-half revenue
gain reflected the first-time consolidation of recently
acquired units such as Technofan and Labauto Iberica. It said
the advance would have been limited to 5% after adjustment
for these structural changes.</p>
<p>The group hasn't yet published comparable first-half
earnings figures. For all of 1989, Labinal's consolidated net
income after payments to minority interests was 272 million
francs on revenue of 6.800 billion francs.</p>
