	<p class="article-leader">International American Homes Inc. said that it took a $6
million pretax write-down on its real estate inventory in its
fiscal first quarter and that it would suspend operations in
Southeast Florida and curtail them in California.
   For the quarter ended June 30, the Clark, N.J.-based
company reported a loss of $4.1 million, or 59 cents a share,
after the write-down. In the year-earlier period, it had a
profit of $1.6 million or 23 cents a share. Revenue in the
recent quarter was $13.4 million, down from $41 million a
year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company, which has been operating under bankruptcy
court protection since April 16, said the write-down was
necessary because of the continuing slump in the home
building industry.</p>
<p>In addition, the company saw its home sales revenue and
profit margins fall in all market areas.</p>
<p>In the wake of its filing for Chapter 11 protection from
creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, construction
lenders have been unwilling to finance any new projects,
making it difficult to restore normal operations, the company
said.</p>
<p>The company continues to market homes in the Washington,
D.C., Baltimore, and Tampa, Fla., areas. It said is
attempting to dispose of all excess inventory.</p>
