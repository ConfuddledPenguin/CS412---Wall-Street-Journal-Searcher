	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Wistar Institute said its researchers plan
to start a field test of a genetically engineered rabies
vaccine Aug. 20. The test will be the first outdoor use in
the U.S. of a recombinant animal virus.
   Wistar, a biomedical research center, plans to distribute
vaccine-laden baits over part of Parramore Island, off the
eastern shore of Virginia. The goal is to protect raccoons
against rabies. If the trial succeeds, the bait might be used
elsewhere, since raccoons are common carriers of the rabies
virus. Wistar is especially interested in using the vaccine
to control current rabies outbreaks in the mid-Atlantic
states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wistar received federal approval for the trial more than a
year ago. But the trial was delayed as the institute sought
clearances from state authorities who had questions about
safety and liability. A proposal to do a trial on an island
off South Carolina was blocked by state health authorities,
at least temporarily. Virginia regulators granted approval
just last month.</p>
<p>Parramore Island, which is owned by the Nature
Conservancy, has a large raccoon population but is
uninhabited by people and lies some four miles from the
mainland. The choice of a remote island for the trial
reflects Wistar's efforts to allay public concerns, though
the institute maintains the vaccine poses no hazard. Similar
tests in the wild have already been carried out in Europe.</p>
<p>Wistar made the vaccine by inserting a small piece of
genetic material from the rabies virus into vaccinia virus,
which serves as a carrier for vaccine delivery. The institute
says the genetic material from the rabies virus isn't
infectious but can produce a protective immune response. It
adds that it has tested the vaccine in some 35 species in
captivity without ill effects.</p>
