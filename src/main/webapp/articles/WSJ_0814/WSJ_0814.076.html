	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush, seeking what he calls "more
normal" economic ties with the Soviet Union, raised a
longstanding ceiling on the total number of Soviet
businessmen permitted to live and work in the U.S.
   That limit has remained for many years at 69. Mr. Bush,
who didn't say how many more Soviet businessmen will be
allowed into the U.S., linked his step to the need to
"establish overall equality of opportunity for American
business people" who live in the Soviet Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush said this move is in line with U.S. commitments
to assist the Soviet Union "institutionalize lasting,
market-oriented economic reforms." However, he cautioned that
he could reconsider his decision "should there be evidence
that this opportunity is being misused for
intelligence-gathering or other inappropriate activities."</p>
<p>U.S. companies have been pressing for the right to post
more resident representatives in the Soviet Union and to have
wider contacts in Soviet society. But such privileges are
limited by reciprocity rules. U.S. companies with Soviet
joint ventures also are seeking easier entry to the U.S. for
their Soviet partners.</p>
