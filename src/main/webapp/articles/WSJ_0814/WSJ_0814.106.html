	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Trading activity in the bond market was
brought to a virtual standstill as a power outage in lower
Manhattan, which includes Wall Street, left some dealers
without equipment with which to buy or sell securities.
   "We didn't see any trading" during most of the afternoon,
said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Securities dealers such as Shearson were unable to trade
because their electronic broker screens were inoperable and
telephone lines were dead. The power outage occurred in the
early afternoon and was caused by a fire at a Consolidated
Edison substation.</p>
<p>Even firms that weren't affected by the outage said they
saw very little business. "Nothing was going on," said Joel
Kazis, manager of government trading at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham. He said the market was moderately active during
morning trading, but "once the power failure happened
downtown, things really quieted down."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bond prices ended mixed. The benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond ended 1/4 point lower, a loss of $2.50 for a
bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to
8.80%.</p>
<p>Dealers said prices of long-term securities continued to
suffer from perceptions that inflation is accelerating.
Yesterday's rise in the price of oil and gold merely
heightened investors fears of inflation.</p>
<p>Short-term securities, however, ended modestly higher
because of perceptions that the Federal Reserve will soon
ease monetary policy by lowering the federal funds rate from
8%. The rate is what banks charge each other on overnight
loans.</p>
<p>"Investors believe that the Fed will ease soon," said
Lawrence Leuzzi, a trading manager at S.G. Warburg. Mr.
Leuzzi believes the Fed could vote to ease credit conditions
after its next Federal Open Market Committee meeting,
scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>Until then, Mr. Leuzzi believes that prices of short-term
securities will continue to rise. The latest two-year notes
ended about 1/8 point higher, while the yield on the notes
fell to 7.89%.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 99 13/32 to
yield 8.80%, compared with Friday's price of 99 21/32 to
yield 8.771%.</p>
<p>The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 100 13/32 to
yield 8.67%, compared with Friday's price of 100 17/32 to
yield 8.65%.</p>
<p>The Treasury sold $18.4 billion of shortterm bills
yesterday at its regular weekly auction. Although some
primary dealers had trouble placing bids at the auction
because of the power outage, a spokesman for the Fed said the
auction proceeded smoothly.</p>
<p>The average discount rate was 7.41% for three-month bills
and 7.31% for six-month bills. Those rates were higher than
at last week's auction, when they were 7.23% and 7.19%,
respectively.</p>
<p>Here are auction details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>The junk bond market edged lower on thin volume after the
power outage in lower Manhattan.</p>
<p>"The afternoon was a non-event," said one high-yield
trader. "Of the five brokers I talk to, only two were fully
staffed."</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
or no credit ratings, ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower.</p>
<p>Among the high-yield securities that traded lower were
junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. RJR's 17% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures ended 3/8 point lower at 90 1/8, while
the food and tobacco giant's 13.5% subordinated debentures
finished down 1/4 point at 97 1/2.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Fort Howard Corp. were also lower after
the company reported that its second-quarter loss widened to
$26.8 million from $19.3 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Fort Howard's 12 3/8% senior subordinated notes ended 3/8
point lower at 95 3/4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, among the key gainers were junk bonds of Bond
Brewing, which skyrocketed on unconfirmed rumors that a
higher tender offer for the bonds is in the works. Bond
Brewing's 12.625% subordinated debentures, due in 2006,
closed up 10 points at 62.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The plunge in the Japanese stock market caught up with the
already wobbly Japanese government bond market, sending bond
prices sharply lower.</p>
<p>Driven largely by arbitrage trading, the Nikkei stock
average ended 4% lower, the fourth-largest drop in percentage
terms. In response, the price of Japan's benchmark No. 119
10-year bond ended at 83.26, down 0.28 point, to yield
8.085%.</p>
<p>The selling in the stock and bond markets had a greater
impact than might otherwise have been the case as
participation is thin with the Japanese August holidays in
full swing. On the other hand, the absence of investors
during another rout in the Japanese markets may have relieved
them of another source of selling.</p>
<p>West German and British government bonds ended lower in
quiet trading.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Municipal bond prices were virtually unaffected by the
power problems, traders said, with bonds stable at early
levels of 1/8 to 3/8 point easier.</p>
<p>"If bonds were going to be volatile, this has probably
taken it out of them," one trader said.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018
was off 3/8 point, at 98 bid to yield 7.35%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities trading ground to a standstill during
the power outage in New York.</p>
<p>One trader quoted Government National Mortgage Association
9 1/2% pass-through securities for August delivery at 99 1/4,
up 1/8 on the day, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2%
securities up 5/32 at 98 26/32, and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9 1/2% securities up 1/8 at 99 10/32.</p>
<p>Prior to the trading interruption, pricing details for a
$500 million Freddie Mac real estate mortgage investment
conduit were announced.</p>
