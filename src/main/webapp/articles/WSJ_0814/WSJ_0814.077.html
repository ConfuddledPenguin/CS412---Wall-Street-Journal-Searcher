	<p class="article-leader">I am absolutely delighted with my brand-new subscription
to The Wall Street Journal, and I thought you'd like to know.
I get it every day at 5:30 p.m., and I genuinely look forward
to its arrival.
   I may be unusual among your subscribers, in that I spend
about 24% of my monthly income for my subscription to the
Journal: I'm in prison, and have less than $50 a month to
spend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You also may be interested to know that each issue gets
circulated among a group of readers, in return for other
publications. The Journal has real barter value in this
society, but the barter group is small: There are only a few
inmates who care what Alan Greenspan said yesterday (or who
he is in the first place).</p>
<p>Thanks for doing such a good job. You can be certain I'll
continue to be an enthusiastic subscriber even after this
period in my life is over. Although I'm signing my name,
please don't use it; I've had more publicity than I want by
now.</p>
<p>Inmate E-23884</p>
