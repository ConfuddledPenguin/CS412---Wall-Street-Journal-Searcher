	<p class="article-leader">New Yorkers are mad as hell and they aren't going to take
it anymore.
   Takeout menus, that is.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It comes with living in New York: Chinese restaurants
relentlessly shove takeout menus under doors in apartments
and brownstones. Of course, many urban dwellers take full
advantage and order by telephone. But how many menus does one
household need?</p>
<p>To combat the growing paper assault, "No Menus" posters
are popping up in lobbies all over Manhattan. Sometimes the
posters have a Chinese menu with the international "no"
symbol -- a circle with slash mark -- superimposed on it.</p>
<p>The signs can be quite elaborate: some are written in
Chinese. Others threaten a full-scale boycott of the
offending establishment if the menus don't stop coming.</p>
<p>"I call these restaurants myself and say, `You've got to
stop doing this, it's annoying the tenants,'" says Rick
Delacruz, the building manager of Checkers, a rental
apartment house on Manhattan's Upper West Side. "They say
they're sorry and a week later, they're back."</p>
<p>What infuriates some New Yorkers is how delivery persons,
after dropping off food at one apartment, can then wander the
building, leaving menus upon menus in their wake.</p>
<p>In a random check, a dozen Chinese restaurants around town
deny that they are the culprits. "We even have a list of
apartment buildings where we're not welcome," says James
Shau, manager of the Empire Szechuan Columbus on Columbus
Avenue. "I notice the signs. We instruct our employees not to
do it. But every day we have a change in personnel and so
it's done sporadically."</p>
<p>"If people have signs, we don't put them in the building,"
says the manager of another restaurant. "But we still put
them in where there are no signs."</p>
<p>Apartment managers compare the menus to another big city
annoyance: roaches. They may disappear for a while, but it's
only a matter of time before they return. Mr. Delacruz says
it is embarrassing, when showing a vacant apartment to a
prospective tenant, to find a slew of menus under the door.
"It shows our security is in question," he says.</p>
<p>Tom Goodman, a spokesman for CBS News, says his Upper East
Side apartment building has a partial solution. "The doormen
tell offending restaurants they won't be allowed to deliver
to the building anymore," he says.</p>
