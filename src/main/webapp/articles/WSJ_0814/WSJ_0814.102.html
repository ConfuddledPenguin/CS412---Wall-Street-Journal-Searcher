	<p class="article-leader">SPRINGDALE, Ark. -- Like many U.S. companies, Tyson Foods
Inc. is establishing a beachhead in Europe. Unlike most
others, though, Tyson's commander-in-chief is leading the
invasion.
   Don Tyson, the chairman and chief executive officer of the
chicken processing company, told his staff last week that he
plans to establish a home and office in England sometime
after the first of the year. He said he plans to spend the
first two weeks of each month in Arkansas and the last two in
the U.K., tending to the expansion of his chicken empire
there. He expects he'll maintain his part-time residence in
England for at least six months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tyson, known as a hands-on executive who is reluctant
to delegate, said he isn't sure whether the company's chicken
products will fly in Europe. "I want to take the credit if it
goes well," he said. "If it doesn't, I'll face that too."</p>
<p>Currently, Tyson holds 50% of a company that sells hens
and roosters in the U.K. and several European countries. Mr.
Tyson plans to grow and process chickens at the company, as
well as market the company's chicken products.</p>
