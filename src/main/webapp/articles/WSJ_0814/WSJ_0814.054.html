	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is taking a hard
line on prohibiting food shipments to Iraq, despite
"humanitarian" concerns being raised overseas and the
potential economic harm to U.S. farmers.
   Administration officials believe cutting Iraq's food
supply may be the most effective weapon against Iraqi
strongman Saddam Hussein. They continue to insist on
preventing all food imports into the country. State
Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said yesterday food
shortages already have begun to occur in Baghdad. And
estimates by the Agriculture Department suggest Iraq will run
out of basic foodstuffs as early as October.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But private analysts doubt the Bush administration will be
able to block food shipments to Iraq for long. They cite
three reasons. First, Turkey and Jordan may allow overland
food shipments into Iraq. Second, world public opinion is
likely to condemn any U.S. effort to starve the Iraqis. And
third, Saddam Hussein could respond by cutting off food
supplies first to the 2,500 Americans caught in Iraq and
Kuwait, a move that could cause public opinion in the U.S. to
turn against using the food weapon against Baghdad.</p>
<p>"I'm very skeptical of our ability to control the flow of
food" into Iraq, says Patrick Clawson, an economist with the
Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ban on exports to Iraq is beginning to
pinch U.S. farmers, who count the Middle East nation as their
12th-largest export market. American rice growers were the
first to feel the loss. In recent years, Iraq has been the
largest single export market for U.S. rice, accounting for
about 10% of total U.S. production, or about $170 million
annually. The price had fallen about 10% in July, and it
dropped 5% more in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>So far, rice farmers have been stoic-at least publicly.
"We certainly are not condemning the government for this,"
says Jack Wendt, a Richmond, Texas, rice grower. "I would
have done the same thing, but agriculture ends up on the
short end."</p>
<p>The United Nations resolution banning all trade with Iraq
included an exception for food and medicine needed for
"humanitarian" purposes. Bush administration officials
insisted yesterday that the U.S. ban on trade applies to all
products except medical supplies. "At this point in the
situation, we think it's clearly far too early to consider
any foodstuffs as being in a humanitarian need category,"
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.</p>
<p>Turkey, on the other hand, has indicated it might continue
to allow food shipments into Iraq, and many experts believe
Jordan will do the same. "The road in from Jordan was capable
of carrying 439,000 tons a month in December 1988," said Mr.
Clauson. "If the Jordanian government permits things in, they
{the Iraqis} won't have difficulty."</p>
<p>Attempts to prohibit food exports have been rare in the
past, since they often affect civilians more than the
government and military. But Jeffrey Schott of the Institute
for International Economics, who wrote a book on the use of
economic sanctions, pointed out, "We very seldom have had
such a comprehensive set of sanctions. In the past, even if
one country wanted that tight an embargo, others wouldn't go
along."</p>
<p>Even if Iraq pulls out of Kuwait and the Middle East
returns to normal, U.S. rice growers may never recover their
Iraqi market completely. The grain embargo the U.S. imposed
on the Soviet Union after that country's invasion of
Afghanistan gave Argentina and other wheat producers a chance
to grab market share they have held ever since.</p>
<p>Thailand moved in to sell rice to Iraq when U.S. rice
sales to Iraq essentially were cut off this past spring after
the U.S. refused to provide loan guarantees as a result of a
controversy unrelated to the Kuwaiti invasion. "The Iraqi
market had already been lost to the U.S. rice farmer and
industry for this year," said Thomas Slayton, director of
market analysis at the Rice Millers Assocation, a U.S. trade
group.</p>
<p>"Now you're pretty well guaranteed that you're not going
to sell them any rice as long as Saddam Hussein is in power,"
said Fred Tanner, a Bernie, Mo., rice grower. "Or at least
until he converts to Christianity."</p>
<p>Rice prices were under pressure before the latest
developments in Iraq. Because of favorable weather, rice
growers all over the world have been harvesting bumper crops.
Prices also were depressed by the return of Vietnam to the
export business.</p>
<p>Rice for September delivery was quoted yesterday on the
Chicago Rice and Cotton Exchange at $6.65 a hundred pounds,
down about 40 cents from the beginning of August, said Scott
Minton, a trader at Rodman & Renshaw in Chicago.</p>
<p>Taxpayers may end up sharing the pain with rice growers.
Under government farm programs, rice growers essentially can
sell their crop to the U.S. at $6.50 a hundredweight even if
market prices drop below that level.</p>
<p>Last year, Iraq imported about 570,000 tons of rice,
392,000 tons from the U.S. and most of the rest from
Thailand, the U.S. Agriculture Department says. Arkansas and
Texas growers of the long-grain rice the Iraqis favor haven't
much choice but to sit and watch prices for their crop sink.
The industry says it can't immediately find another customer
for so much rice -- particularly one that pays in cash as the
Iraqi government did.</p>
<p>Continued tension in the Middle East can only make the
market worse; after Iraq, the next largest customer for U.S.
rice is Saudi Arabia. In all, the Middle East accounts for
about one-third of U.S. rice exports. The populace there
likes rice, but they can't grow very much because water is so
scarce. "It's a ready-made market," said Jim Willis, a vice
president of USA Rice Council, the industry's promotion arm.
"Water's worth more than oil."</p>
