	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- Peter Johnson is an AIDS activist in the
sense that his Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc. is racing to find
a drug for the dread disease. The medical effort "to swarm
over a problem in almost Manhattan Project-style intensity"
is okay with him -- he sees progress in each incremental
dollar.
   But the president/CEO of the biomedical start-up admits to
ambivalence about fixating on one illness, even as this has
led to "unbelievable" gains in knowledge about the human
immunodeficiency virus carried by an estimated eight million
or more world-wide. An Agouron-led consortium is getting $4.6
million over five years from the National Institutes of
Health for its AIDS work, but the company has felt a drought
just beyond the downpour.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"By contrast, we're very interested in malaria," Mr.
Johnson notes. This is a malady that, according to the World
Health Organization, afflicts 270 million people, killing up
to two million of them a year. Most of the dead are children
under age five. "However, it's not a disease we know in
America, and there's virtually no funding available in the
United States for the investigation of malaria," he says.</p>
<p>Agouron did get a $500,000 federal grant for such work.
Mr. Johnson says he doesn't see commercial potential in the
market-poor countries where malaria is epidemic, but the work
"is a relatively minor detour from some other things that
we're doing" to find treatments for vaginal and
post-operative infections.</p>
<p>The bulk of the company's budget actually is still devoted
to Agouron's original mission, cancer. The enterprise is on
the frontier of "rational drug design," a putative
breakthrough in therapeutics that uses engineering to attempt
molecular remedies rather than go through the traditional,
one-by-one screening of known substances for possible
curatives.</p>
<p>This revolution is in an early stage, and Agouron hasn't
made money since going public in 1987. But it has some
proprietary technology, and its scientists expect to publish
significant findings on protein enzymes and cancer this
month. The company is attracting the interest of major drug
marketers -- including the rather insular Japanese
pharmaceutical industry -- for which Agouron's applied
research can bridge basic science to commercial application.
Eli Lilly & Co. has two projects and a 12% stake in the
company.</p>
<p>Agouron is one of about 80 biotechnology concerns to have
sprung up around this city's University of California campus,
forming one of the largest such knowledge hubs in the nation.
The La Jolla neighborhood includes the Scripps Clinic and the
Salk Institute. Local development officials credit higher
education as a drawing card, in addition to the dream
climate. (Agouron is across the road from the famed Torrey
Pines golf course, though as it nears 100 employees it must
find bigger quarters nearby.)</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, 45, did graduate work here in the philosophy
of science, followed by five years as a chemistry researcher.
The son of a real-estate executive at Security Pacific Bank,
he left the labs in the late 1970s to make hay of the
development of local agricultural land. That harvest having
been reaped, his business skills fit the needs of the
scientists forming Agouron.</p>
<p>The group, from both UCSD and CalTech, had been working
since the mid-1970s on plotting the "architecture" of the
enzymes associated with malignancies. Today, through X-ray
diffraction of the problem proteins on a pair of
million-dollar units on site, Agouron is trying to design
inhibitors for the cancer agents.</p>
<p>As it happens, that work not only has led Agouron to
research on psoriasis, a skin disease also characterized by
excessive cell growth, but is connected as well to the fight
against the malarial protozoa and infectious bacteria and
fungi, which relate to the same protein enzyme. Mr. Johnson
says the method of designing an AIDS drug is similar, though
in that case the target enzymes are different.</p>
<p>The big federal AIDS grant to Agouron hedges the risk that
standard therapeutic screening will yield nothing in the end.
"The whole field of viral diseases has perhaps two safe and
effective drugs today despite 30 years of work and 14 or 15
major diseases in this category," he says. "The hope was that
(Agouron's approach) simply represented another strategy with
a higher probability of success."</p>
<p>Although emphasis on AIDS has been defended as opening a
window on the vastness of virology, Mr. Johnson says, "If we
had to select, independent of disease considerations, one
from which we could learn the most about the whole family of
viruses, I'm not sure HIV would have been the one selected."
Herpes could fill that bill better, he suggests.</p>
<p>AIDS has proven a politically volatile arena for
pharmaceuticals, compounding the inherent complexity in
science. Agouron is too early in its work to have been
affected directly by pressure groups, but any commercial
entity must be mindful of the attacks on Burroughs-Wellcome
for the pricing of its innovative AZT drug. "We're counting
on there being an acute need, and we're making the assumption
that where there is an acute need we will certainly be able
to cover our costs and a reasonable return on our
investment," says Mr. Johnson. Looking a decade or so out,
however, as AIDS becomes primarily an affliction of the
world's poor, the marketing horizon darkens considerably.</p>
<p>Looming shorter term, and this time with the AIDS lobby
sometimes a corporate ally, are the peculiar priorities of
the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA, with its (pick
one: careful, cumbersome, cranky) ways of approving drugs, is
the bane of several pharmaceutical firms' existence.
Particularly aggrieved are smaller outfits and those trying
to sell hope for the terminally ill. Cetus Corp., for
instance, is currently being put through hoops by one of the
FDA's scientific advisory panels with its interleukin-2 drug
for advanced kidney cancer.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson assesses the situation charitably. Biotech
firms, he says, encounter problems taking a new kind of
science into regulation, "kinds of therapies for which there
isn't any precedent, and anytime that's true you have to
fight your way through certain ambiguities."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, delay is a big risk for companies like
Agouron, he acknowledges. It's not the FDA's actual
standards, but the length of clinical trials and, most
annoying, the lag in simply processing applications. Three
years can pass between the completion of a file and a drug's
approval, Mr. Johnson says. "I know of no business formations
which didn't happen or no projects which are cancelled
because the time line is too imponderable. It just drives you
crazy and keeps you awake at night, and I think in the case
of companies like Cetus wreaks havoc on stock prices and
investor expectations."</p>
