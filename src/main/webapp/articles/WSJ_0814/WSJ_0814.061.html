	<p class="article-leader">Three years ago, Kurdish poet Sami Shoresh could trek all
day through the rough mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. Now, at
age 38, "a walk up a few steps leaves me exhausted," he says.
   In 1987, Mr. Shoresh survived an attempt by an agent of
Saddam Hussein to kill him with thalium -- a slow acting
blood toxin best known as rat-bait. His is one of the
best-documented of numerous cases in which the Iraqi regime
has used thalium. The British toxicologists who treated Mr.
Shoresh call thalium "Iraqi poison" because they have seen it
used on so many of Saddam Hussein's enemies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the Iraqi strongman is reaching over the heads of Arab
leaders to whip up support in the streets, the governments
that now oppose him should blame themselves for censoring
their nations' media to keep their people in the dark. Where
the local Arab population knew about Saddam Hussein's
activities, they have supported their governments' sanctions
against him.</p>
<p>Ordinary Arabs applauding the Iraqi president in Jordan,
Yemen, Algeria and Tunis have never heard of Mr. Shoresh, nor
read Amnesty International reports on Iraqi torture of
children, nor seen the gruesome pictures of Iraq's Halabja
poison gas attack.</p>
<p>In Jordan's press -- one of the region's most analytical
since reforms after last year's riots -- King Hussein's
growing closeness to the Iraqi president was one of the few
remaining taboo subjects. Yemen's state-run media barraged
the people with heroic images of their president linking
hands with the Iraqi strongman.</p>
<p>Iraq didn't rely only on this official image-building.
Arab journalists relate countless examples of Iraqi gifts and
bribes to burnish coverage. One common ploy was to offer
poorly paid Arab journalists a good deal of money to write
columns in Iraqi-funded journals. Such deals swiftly
disappeared if the writers' domestic reports drifted from a
pro-Iraqi line.</p>
<p>And if bribery failed, threats emerged. Sami Farag Ali, a
British-based dissident Iraqi journalist, got a call one day
from Iraq: "Don't think you are safe just because you are in
London," said the caller, a senior aide to Saddam Hussein.
"With one word I can have your head brought to Baghdad."</p>
<p>If Egyptians now are of one mind with their government's
opposition to Iraq, it is because so many of them have
first-hand experience of its brutal regime. More than a
million Egyptians work in Iraq, so a million Egyptian
families have been treated to tales of Saddam Hussein's rule
of repression and fear. For free-wheeling Egyptians, whose
favorite pastime is devising wickedly funny political jokes,
life in Baghdad's silent society was grim indeed.</p>
<p>Even in trivial ways, Iraqi officials made Egyptians'
lives miserable. At the airport, poor Egyptian laborers often
were forced to queue for days to get home to Cairo. Lines
stretched out of the terminal onto the baking sidewalk, where
exhausted men slept on their rumpled bundles of belongings
because nobody bothered to organize confirmed reservations.</p>
<p>Now, those same Egyptians are cheering their president's
tough stand against Iraq. For governments that aren't
enjoying the same support, the current crisis might contain
useful lessons on the benefits of arming their people with
that most potent of all weapons -- the truth.</p>
