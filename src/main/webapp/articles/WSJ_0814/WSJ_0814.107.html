	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Within reason, brokerage houses in the
Journal-Zacks study of stock-picking prowess may choose what
list of stocks they will be judged on. Of course, they have
to specify in advance.
   Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and Raymond James are judged by
the stocks their analysts rate "1" on a five-point scale.
Kidder Peabody is judged by stocks rated "1"or "2."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A.G. Edwards is judged by stocks analysts say to "buy" or
"accumulate." Prudential-Bache is judged on a each analyst's
"single best idea," not counting sell recommendations.</p>
<p>At four firms -- Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs, Shearson
Lehman and Smith Barney, a stock-selection committee reviews
analysts' recommendations and selects a subgroup as the
firm's official recommended list. Smith Barney goes one step
further, and winnows the committee list down to a short
"retail recommended list."</p>
<p>The study assumes that an investor buys the recommended
stocks, and sells all others, even if they're designated as
"holds" or "weak buys." Equal dollar amounts are put into
each stock, and portfolios are adjusted monthly to keep the
amounts equal. All buying and selling is on the last trading
day of each month. Commissions and taxes are disregarded,
mostly to make the results comparable to market indexes.
Dividends are included.</p>
<p>Brokerage houses are given a chance to check the data for
accuracy. Nine firms did so this quarter; Merrill Lynch said
it didn't have a person available to do the checking.</p>
