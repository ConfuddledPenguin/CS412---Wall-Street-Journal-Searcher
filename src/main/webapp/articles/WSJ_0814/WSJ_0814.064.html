	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For investment banker Leon Black, there is
life after Drexel.
   During the 1980's heyday of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
Mr. Black helped such takeover artists as Carl Icahn, Henry
Kravis and William Farley buy companies. He earned an
estimated $10 million to $20 million a year for his trouble.
But on Feb. 13, that career came to an end when Drexel
collapsed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now Mr. Black and several ex-Drexel colleagues have
resurfaced as managers of a $400 million fund that will
invest in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Black says that is just the start of his comeback
plan. In an interview, the 39-year-old investment banker
confirmed market talk that he is partway through raising
another big fund that "can go into anything." The new fund
could run the gamut from taking big equity stakes in
companies at management's request to making equity or debt
investments in financially troubled companies that need
restructuring. Mr. Black said he might even consider
leveraged buy-outs if that market ever revives.</p>
<p>One profitable area for Mr. Black may be in working with
former Drexel clients that have fallen into financial
distress in the past 18 months. Some of those executives
mightn't ever want to see a Drexel deal-maker again. But Mr.
Black isn't deterred. "A lot of companies need to be sold or
refinanced," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Black's recent success at raising money is all the
more remarkable because of Drexel's tarnished image. Both
Drexel and Michael Milken, the firm's former junk-bond chief,
pleaded guilty to felony counts involving securities-law
violations. In addition, many clients that Drexel financed
and hailed as success stories, from Mr. Farley to airline
executive Frank Lorenzo, have tripped over the heavy debt
loads that Drexel created for them.</p>
<p>In his salad days at Drexel, Mr. Black was co-head of
Drexel's mergers and acquisitions department in New York,
designing deals powered by Mr. Milken's junk-bond juggernaut
in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Black said he believes his $400 million fund can
earn 15% to 20% annually as a passive investor in junk bonds.
"There was a time when you could get 25%," he said. But the
junk-bond market's partial rebound, coupled with the
refinancing of RJR Nabisco Inc., has removed many of the
biggest bargains, Mr. Black argues.</p>
<p>In his new incarnation as a junk-bond manager, Mr. Black
is collecting his biggest backing from European institutions.
They include Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and Thomson
S.A., the French electrical concern, people familiar with the
fund said. Executives of Credit Lyonnais didn't return phone
calls. A Thomson spokesman didn't have any immediate comment.</p>
<p>Wall Street and corporate executives who know Mr. Black
are divided about his chances of success on his own.
Especially in the early stages of his Drexel career, Mr.
Black was an eccentric figure amidst Wall Street's dandies,
known for his untucked shirt-tails and his tardiness in
arriving at client meetings.</p>
<p>But Abe Claude, an executive recruiter at Russell-Reynolds
Associates, said Mr. Black "has the kind of visibility that
not many others at Drexel had. He wasn't overshadowed by Mike
Milken. People know who he is."</p>
<p>Leon Kalvaria, a managing director of First Boston Corp.,
said, "Given the depressed levels in the high-yield market,
this is an ideal time for smart money to look for
opportunities."</p>
<p>Douglas LeBon, a pension consultant at Wilshire Associates
in Santa Monica, Calif., added that big institutions are
eager to invest in privately placed financings with
specialists like Mr. Black, given that most mainstream stock
and bond managers fail to consistently match the market
averages. "If you are going to get extraordinary returns, you
must go to private placements," Mr. LeBon said.</p>
<p>Mr. Black conceded that he doesn't have a track record as
a junk-bond portfolio manager, but said he is familiar with
many of the companies in which he might invest because Drexel
underwrote many of their bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Black said he hasn't chosen a name for his new firm,
but is leaning toward something like Apollo Investments,
named after the Greek god of healing. Mr. Black also said
that several Drexel alumni will become partners in his new
business, including John Hannon, Drexel's former head of
international mergers and acquisitions, and investment banker
Arthur Bilger.</p>
<p>Mr. Black currently is renting midtown Manhattan office
space from Bennett LeBow, a former Drexel client. Mr. Black
said that later this year, he plans to open his own offices
in New York and California -- though not in Beverly Hills,
where Mr. Milken plied his trade.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. mergers business has slowed considerably
because of the junk-bond market's woes, Mr. Black said he
sees lots of potential business abroad. "Foreign companies
are the most logical buyers" of U.S. corporations, he
asserted. Mr. Black said he has a particular interest in
French deals; he said he speaks passable French and can do
business in that language.</p>
