	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department awarded two contracts,
each potentially valued at $1.5 billion over 10 years, for
advanced design work on two types of new nuclear reactors.
   The department selected Ebasco Services Inc., a subsidiary
of Enserch Corp. of Dallas, to provide advanced design work
for a heavy-water reactor to produce tritium, a perishable
radioactive gas used in making nuclear weapons. Ebasco was
selected over Westinghouse Electric Corp., a department
spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the other contract, to design a modular,
high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor, the agency selected a
consortium consisting of General Atomics, Combustion
Engineering Inc., Stone & Webster Engineering Co. and Burns &
Roe Co. This type of reactor, based on a relatively new
technology, would use a helium coolant. The consortium had no
competition for the long-term contract, the government
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The department wants to build two new reactors to replace
its aging and crippled tritium reactors at Savannah River,
S.C. One would be built at the Savannah River site, the other
at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho
Falls, Idaho.</p>
<p>However, Congress has questioned whether two reactors are
necessary, especially given the thaw in relations with the
Soviet Union. Construction money to complete either of the
reactors hasn't been appropriated.</p>
<p>The new reactors, which if built would come on line in the
year 2000, are to incorporate "passively safe" systems that
offer safety features reducing the dependence on operators
and mechanical parts in accidents.</p>
