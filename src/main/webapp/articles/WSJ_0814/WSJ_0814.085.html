	<p class="article-leader">AMERICAN BARRICK RESOURCES Corp. said it plans to sell
five million common shares for total proceeds of 122.5
million Canadian dollars (U.S.$106.8 million). The Toronto
gold mining concern said an underwriting group led by Gordon
Capital Corp. agreed to purchase the shares for C$24.50 each
for later resale to the public in Canada and in Europe.
American Barrick said it will use the proceeds for
development work on existing properties, potential
acquisitions and the repayment of long-term debt.</p>
