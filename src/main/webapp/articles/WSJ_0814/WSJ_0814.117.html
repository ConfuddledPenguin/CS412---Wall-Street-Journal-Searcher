	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A power blackout in lower Manhattan forced an
early-afternoon closing of New York's two biggest commodity
exchanges and the American Stock Exchange, disrupting trading
in some financial markets.
   Futures trading was halted in oil and gold, two of the
world's most important commodities whose prices have jumped
in reaction to turmoil in the Middle East. The blackout also
affected a wide range of financial instruments, from stock
options and currencies to the Federal Reserve's weekly
auction of Treasury bills. Trading in bond markets was
especially hard hit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was an eerie scene. Hundreds of traders stood in
darkened commodity trading pits in the World Trade Center,
below clocks that stood frozen at 1:13. Now-useless trading
cards littered the floor.</p>
<p>The New York Mercantile Exchange, which trades the world's
benchmark oil futures contract, and the Commodity Exchange,
which trades the major gold contract, both shut down trading.
Three smaller commodity exchanges and the nearby American
Stock Exchange, a major stock-options market, joined them.</p>
<p>But several blocks away on Broad Street, the New York
Stock Exchange, the nation's biggest stock market, remained
open and finished up in a final-hour rally.</p>
<p>The blackout was caused by a fire that broke out around
noon EDT in a Consolidated Edison electrical substation and
knocked out power to several blocks in the financial district
here. As of late yesterday, Con Ed officials said most of the
power had been restored, but not before eight firefighters
out of 100 on the scene were injured.</p>
<p>The exchanges plan to open today, barring any further
blackouts. But the disruption couldn't have come at a worse
time for New York's commodity markets, which have been roiled
in the past week by volatile oil and precious metals trading.
For the first time in more than a decade, traders and
investors had no closing price for oil and gold and other
important commodities.</p>
<p>However, these and other commodities continued to trade in
ports and other trading centers -- the spot markets -- in the
U.S. and abroad. But that didn't help some futures traders
who were stuck in the middle of trading positions.</p>
<p>Blair Karasin, an independent stock-index futures trader,
said that he had bet that stock prices would rise, but that
he didn't complete his trade because he couldn't reach
brokers in Chicago, where index futures are traded. Now he
doesn't know the price at which he will be able to complete
the transaction.</p>
<p>"I hope nothing terrible happens overnight," he said after
walking down eight flights of stairs at the World Trade
Center. The New York Merc and Comex said they would establish
settlement prices for commodities traded there at today's
close.</p>
<p>Yesterday's problems demonstrated once again how
concentrated the nation's financial machinery is, and how
quickly the markets can be disrupted. Major brokerage firms
and the stock exchanges -- including the Big Board -- have
spent millions of dollars in recent years to build better
backup systems to handle emergencies. Many of those systems
were used yesterday to keep some semblance of order.</p>
<p>At the darkened Merc and Comex, prices stood frozen on
wallboards above traders' heads: The current crude oil
contract stood at $26.77 a barrel, up 54 cents; gold was
$405.20 an ounce, up $8.20. The Merc plans to open by 11
today; the Comex hadn't yet set an opening time.</p>
<p>Although the American Stock Exchange shut down, trading in
some of its stocks continued on regional exchanges, traders
said. The Amex composite index closed at 338.14, down 1.18.</p>
<p>The blackout occurred shortly before the bidding deadline
for the government's regular weekly Treasury bill auction.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which conducts the
auction on behalf of the Treasury Department, said the sale
of $18.4 billion of three-month and six-month bills proceeded
smoothly. That's because the Fed's trading and auction
equipment was running on a backup power system.</p>
<p>"As far as we are concerned, the dealers were all able to
make bids and therefore the auction took place normally,"
said a Fed spokesman.</p>
<p>But several dealers had trouble communicating with their
own employees who were waiting at the Fed to receive bidding
instructions from their trading desks. Some employees
couldn't get through to find out at what price to bid.</p>
<p>A manager at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
said his firm was forced to bid "blind" at the auction,
meaning that it participated without knowing exactly how the
market was trading. Dealers typically base auction bid prices
on current market prices, which change rapidly in the bond
market.</p>
<p>It's not the first time that trading has been disrupted at
the exchanges here. Two weeks ago, the New York commodity
exchanges closed for 50 minutes when the ticker feed that
transmits commodity prices broke. But traders and exchange
officials couldn't recall the last time the exchanges didn't
provide final settlement prices.</p>
<p>The power outage, which struck Con Ed's South Street
Seaport substation, also wasn't the most disruptive that Wall
Street has seen. That's because the Big Board didn't have to
close. An early-morning electrical fire last November shut
down both the Big Board and the American Stock Exchange for
an hour, temporarily dislocating stock-index futures trading
on the Chicago commodity exchanges.</p>
<p>That fire broke out in the lower-Manhattan building that
houses the Securities Industry Automation Corp., which
processes stock quotations from the nation's major exchanges.</p>
<p>The U.S. foreign-exchange market, which trades about $175
billion a day, also was thrown into some confusion yesterday.
Initially, only a few institutions were affected. But as the
day went on, the blackout spread, knocking out phone lines
and trading screens at banks, securities firms and currency
brokers.</p>
<p>Some dealers alleged that Chicago traders tried to take
advantage of the situation. With many big commercial and
investment banks here unable to trade, they said, traders on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange tried to push the dollar
higher.</p>
<p>By so doing, they were squeezing those traders and
speculators who had earlier sold dollars short, betting that
the currency would keep falling. Often, traders, big
investors and corporations leave so-called stop-loss orders
with banks to automatically buy or sell currencies at a
specific price. These act as a safety valve to either lock in
a profit or stem a loss.</p>
<p>But unable to trade, some New York banks couldn't fulfill
these stop-losses and some dealers got caught in a
shortsqueeze, said a trader at Chase Manhattan Bank here. "It
was difficult to call out and get prices," said Leonard
Dendunnen, a trader at Union Bank of Switzerland here.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York switched immediately
to backup power, a spokesman said. Although the computerized
system that settles billions of dollars in daily payments
among banks continued to operate during the power outage,
some institutions were having trouble linking up with the
system by computer. But the spokesman said that meant only
that the institutions affected would have to settle
transactions by hand or by messenger.</p>
<p>"Some transactions may be stuck in a computer and have to
be done manually," he said, "but the capacity exists to
settle normally."</p>
<p>At the two big commercial banks with headquarters in lower
Manhattan -- J.P. Morgan and Bank of New York -- the power
outage caused only marginal problems. "There was only a brief
interruption of trading until the emergency power kicked on,"
said a spokesman for J.P. Morgan. At Bank of New York, a
spokesman said that while there was no interruption of
customer transactions, the building was without lights.
"We're literally in the dark," the spokesman said.</p>
