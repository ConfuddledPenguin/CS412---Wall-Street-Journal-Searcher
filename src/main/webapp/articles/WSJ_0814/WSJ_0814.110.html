net loss for the second quarter of $3.4 million, or 68 cents
a share, disclosed it now is in default on all of its debt
obligations outstanding.
   For the year-ago period, the financial services company
had a loss of $3.3 million, or 68 cents a share. That figure
includes a loss of $2 million from discontinued operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue for the recent period declined 30%, to $8.3
million from $11.8 million.</p>
<p>For the six months ended June 30, Equitec posted a net
loss of $8.8 million, or $1.78 a share, which includes losses
from continuing operations of $7.7 million and from
discontinued operations of $1.1 million.</p>

officer, said the company continues to work with its advisers
to "investigate alternative methods of restructuring its debt
and other obligations."</p>
