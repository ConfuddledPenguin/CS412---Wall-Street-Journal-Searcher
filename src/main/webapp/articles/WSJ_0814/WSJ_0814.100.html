	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Mayor Marion Barry switched his party
affiliation to independent from Democrat as a prelude to a
possible run for an at-large seat on the Washington City
Council.
   Mr. Barry took the preliminary step toward reviving his
political career only three days after he was convicted of a
misdemeanor cocaine-possession charge. A federal court jury
acquitted the three-term mayor on another cocaine-possession
charge and deadlocked on 12 other counts, including drug
possession, conspiracy and perjury. A sentencing date hasn't
been set.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Barry has said he won't run again for mayor. At a news
conference yesterday, he refused to commit himself to any
particular race, including one for a seat on the 13-member
council. He had to switch political affiliation to remain
eligible for the November ballot. He must make a final
decision whether to run within the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Smiling enigmatically, the mayor said he changed his
registration "to keep my options." He acknowledged, however,
that some close associates have urged him to leave politics.</p>
