	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Daniel J. Meyer, the new chief executive
officer of Cincinnati Milacron Inc., wants to lead a
wolfpack.
   He holds up the logo for his strategy -- a circle of
wolves, flanked on each side by a fierce wolf's head. "It's
not a joke to us," he said. "Wolves are survivors. They work
in teams, and they go out to kill."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Milacron clearly needs to act more like a wolfpack if it
is to regain its position as a world leader in factory
machinery. Japanese producers now dominate the U.S. machine
tool industry, which Milacron once led. Foreign concerns
supply more than half of the nation's plastics machinery. And
Milacron hasn't earned an acceptable profit since 1981.</p>
<p>Determined to reverse that slide, Milacron executives aim
to rebuild the company's ability to manufacture quality
products more cheaply than competitors. It's a return to
basics after a decade when Milacron, like some other U.S.
manufacturers, tried to rely on old customer loyalties, high
technology and marketing gimmicks, only to find itself beaten
out of traditional markets by foreign competitors.</p>
<p>Operation Wolfpack includes a crash redesign of Milacron's
machines over the next five years to make them cheaper to
manufacture and more reliable. Minimum goal: a 30% cost
reduction on each machine.</p>
<p>Already, Milacron is achieving some early successes. A
redesigned line of plastic injection molding machinery is
reclaiming market share from foreign competitors. Toyota
Motor Corp. will install three of the new machines in its
Georgetown, Ky., auto plant next year. And a new machining
center that costs $74,999 but has more features than the
$112,000 machine it replaces is meeting the Japanese head on.</p>
<p>A second part of the strategy, creating "focus factories"
that engineer, manufacture and service one product line, has
proved to be harder than expected. So far, the change has
cost more in disrupted production than it has contributed in
savings, but it appears that it is about to start paying off.</p>
<p>However, it won't be easy to turn Milacron managers into
wolves. While the 106-year-old machinery producer is loaded
with competent professionals with a great depth of
manufacturing expertise, they've operated in a bureaucratic
and paternalistic environment for decades. And Milacron's
toughest foes, the Japanese and Germans, are acknowledged
world masters of manufacturing.</p>
<p>"Operation Wolfpack can produce a terrific company if it's
well-executed, but the results won't be evident until the
mid-90s," predicted Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. Shareholders will see some disappointments
while it's being implemented, as Caterpillar Inc.
shareholders have with that company's "Plant With a Future"
program, he said. The Peoria, Ill., construction-equipment
producer has had erratic earnings during a major upgrade of
factories.</p>
<p>Erratic earnings wouldn't be anything new for Milacron.
The company had losses in three of the last eight years, and
profits in the other five averaged an anemic 2.5% of sales.
Management in June had to make a public stock offering to
rebuild the balance sheet in preparation for the $250 million
it intends to invest over the next five years to implement
the Wolfpack program.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyer isn't promising a quick turnaround, but he does
expect the 1990 second half to be better than the dismal
first six months, when profits plummetted 63% to $5.6
million, or 22 cents a share. Nonetheless, analysts expect
1990 net to drop below 1989's weak $17.5 million, or 72 cents
a share, on sales of $850.6 million.</p>
<p>Ironically, Milacron's problems arose in part because
management took too long a viewpoint, unlike many other U.S.
companies that worried too much about quarter-to-quarter
profits. A decade ago, the company plunged into robotics and
computeraided manufacturing when those new technologies
seemed poised to revolutionize manufacturing. Milacron
started producing computers, wafers for computer chips, and
huge unmanned manufacturing systems.</p>
<p>Milacron's big, beige computer-controlled machines
attended by bright yellow robots were the hit of many
industry trade shows. Unfortunately, few factory owners could
afford to shell out $10 million to $20 million to buy the
systems, while those who could were reluctant to gamble on
the new technology. The result: Milacron lost millions of
dollars, while the Japanese seized the lion's share of the
U.S. market for standard machine tools.</p>
<p>"We abdicated the standard machine tool market that used
to be Milacron's strength," admitted the 53-year-old Mr.
Meyer, who is the first outsider to head Milacron since the
Geier family bought a controlling interest in 1887.</p>
<p>In the process, the company also lost the respect of some
customers. One Midwest manufacturer said the Milacron
machining center he bought several years ago "operated in the
range of 30% of the time." Despite repeated visits from
Milacron repairmen, "the hydraulic system wouldn't work, the
tool changer wouldn't change tools, or it would change to the
wrong tool. Eventually we sold it to a used machinery
dealer," he said.</p>
<p>Unwilling to risk that "tragic experience" again, the
manufacturer earlier this year selected a new lathe made by
Okuma Machinery Works Ltd., Oguchi, Japan, without even
evaluating a competing Milacron machine.</p>
<p>To be sure, Milacron's problems weren't all of its own
making. A doubling of machine tool demand in 1978 and 1979,
when U.S. car makers were downsizing in response to soaring
gasoline prices, forced some U.S. manufacturers to try
foreignmade machines for the first time. Then the soaring
value of the dollar in the first half of the 1980s made it
easy for overseas competitors to expand their beachhead by
underpricing U.S. producers.</p>
<p>In just 10 years from 1976 to 1986, machine tool imports
soared sevenfold, seizing half the U.S. market. Japanese
producers, pricing at whatever level it took to make a sale,
bought their way into factories that previously wouldn't even
look at their machines. The quality of those machines brought
repeat orders.</p>
<p>Their next step was U.S. production. The Mazak plant in
Florence, Ky., owned by Yamazaki Mazak Corp. of Oguchi,
Japan, is more automated than any owned by Milacron. Adding
insult to injury, Mazak and Okuma, which has a new plant in
Charlotte, N.C., each regards the other as their primary
competitor in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Milacron's new back-to-basics approach emphasizes quality,
cost reduction and return on capital. "Profitability is a new
religion around here," said Raymond E. Ross, senior vice
president, industrial systems. Indeed, even the company's
cafeteria has become a profit center, catering weddings and
banquets. And Milacron's research and development program now
"has a small r and a capital D," said Mr. Ross. Milacron will
no longer carry out research simply "because it is a good
thing to do technologically."</p>
<p>Milacron also has altered its old approach of building
machines to a potential customer's wish list. "Ask a customer
what he wants, and you'll build a Rolls-Royce," said
Christopher C. Cole, Milacron's group vice president, machine
tool products. "But when he looks at the price tag, he may
decide to buy a Chevrolet."</p>
<p>The product redesign effort was pioneered by Milacron's
plastic injection molding machine division. A team that
included people from production, purchasing and sales, as
well as engineering, "looked at every competitor in the
world, from design concepts they used to the materials
employed," said Harold Faig, vice president and general
manager of the unit. "We got away from the not-invented-here
syndrome," borrowing the best concepts found anywhere in the
world. Soliciting assistance from suppliers turned them into
partners.</p>
<p>The effort slashed manufacturing costs 40%, partly by
halving the number of parts required. Now the division is
going after the production process, trying to take out an
additional 15% of the cost by automating parts-making and
streamlining assembly.</p>
<p>Customers have noticed a real difference. "They've become
very price-competitive, the machines perform well and the
service is great," said John Halula, group vice president of
the plastics unit of Worthington Industries Inc., Columbus,
Ohio. "And the machines are U.S.-made, which we like."</p>
<p>Milacron's focus factory concept attempts to capture the
entrepreneurial spirit more common in smaller companies. John
E. Lower said he runs the 400-person turning machine plant
outside Wilmington, Ohio, "as an autonomous company." He does
his own purchasing and controls machine design and pricing.
He's also responsible for installing the metal-cutting lathes
the factory produces and for subsequent repair service. Most
of those functions previously were controlled from
Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Out in the factory, he has moved 120 machines in 10 months
to create production cells. Each does all the machining on a
family of parts, which greatly improves efficiency. Nowadays,
the facility delivers 90% of its machines on time, double the
percentage of a year ago. And Mr. Lower expects the plant to
turn a profit this year, after a lengthy string of losses
that almost prompted Milacron to close it.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mr. Lower plans to broaden the product line
to include smaller, simpler turning machines used by small
factories, a market Milacron had abandoned.</p>
<p>"That's a wolfpack project," he said.</p>
