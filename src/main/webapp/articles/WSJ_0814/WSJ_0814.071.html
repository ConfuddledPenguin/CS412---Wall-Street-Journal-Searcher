	<p class="article-leader">Each time I think I have seen the limits to which you will
go to denigrate the American auto industry (while deifying
the Japanese producers), you surprise me by going even
further.
   Your July 9 page-one story on General Motors' new Saturn
Division is a case in point. The fact that an American
company is investing $3 billion and doing virtually
everything the press preaches American industry must do to
compete against the Japanese doesn't necessarily mean that it
deserves the media's unmitigated praise. At the same time, I
don't think it deserves to be second-guessed before the first
car is ever built as you did in your treatise on how Honda
got more for less. Another Journal example of how those
infallible Japanese manufacturers have outwitted the dumb
Americans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We wait somewhat impatiently for you to balance the scales
a little. Here's one thought for starters. Has anybody
noticed that Honda Prelude sales in 1986 were 80,000 units,
but fell like a rock to only 43,000 units in 1989?</p>
<p>We would like your readers to know that despite what you
write, the Japanese do not walk on water and American
companies can -- and are -- turning out some top-quality,
high-value cars and trucks in this country. It's unfortunate
that the American media either don't agree or don't care or
simply refuse to tell the story.</p>
