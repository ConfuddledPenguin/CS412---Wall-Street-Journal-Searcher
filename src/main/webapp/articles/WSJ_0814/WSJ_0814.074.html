	<p class="article-leader">BROAD-RANGING FUNDS for health and safety gain union
favor.
   The employer-financed funds pay for research, training and
worker-disease screening to improve fitness and avoid injury.
Construction trades are keen on the idea; they had lagged
behind industrial unions, and most of those have only small
health and safety offices. The Laborers Union's two-year-old
fund will double its staff of 15. It "has moved from the 16th
century to the 23rd," says Sandra Tillett of the AFL-CIO.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Sheet Metal Workers have a health and safety institute
and a trust; the institute has done 15,000 asbestos clinical
studies. The Carpenters and Ironworkers unions recently have
set up funds. Joint Auto Workers funds with auto makers offer
health and safety training.</p>
<p>Construction has 6% of U.S. jobs, but over 20% of work
deaths; it has the highest injury rate of any industry.</p>
<p>LEAD LOOMS as the newest big work place health hazard.</p>
<p>With potential plans for stripping lead-based paint from
43 million housing units, and growing bridge, building and
storage-tank replacement or renovation, workers face major
exposure to toxic lead, unions warn. HUD guidelines, diluted
by the White House budget office, are stalled. OSHA excluded
construction work from more-stringent 1978 general
lead-exposure limits, but it mulls tougher rules.</p>
<p>"We already have a lot of workers exposed to lead, and if
this work is done poorly, we're going to have a lot more,"
says John Moran, of the Laborers' health and safety fund.
Plumbers, Painters, Carpenters and Ironworkers unions also
push for protection from lead.</p>
<p>WORKSITE SCHOOLS: A new way to aid working parents.</p>
<p>Dayton Hudson's Target unit will open a school for
kindergarten through second grade next month in Minneapolis.
The company spent "several hundred thousand dollars" to fix
up a storefront space. The school district supplies teachers
and equipment. St. Paul has a 25-pupil kindergarten at First
Bank System, which forgoes $48,000 monthly rent.</p>
<p>Employers cite less absenteeism and stress; school
districts save money and space. Dade County (Fla.) schools
pioneered the idea in 1987; they share programs with Miami
International Airport, American Bankers Insurance Group and a
community college. The district, saving $1 million from
employer-provided buildings, talks to six more employers
about such projects.</p>
<p>A Honeywell Inc. engineer refused a job offer, to stay at
his Clearwater, Fla., facility, where his son is starting
kindergarten.</p>
<p>A DIFFERENT TACK: A federal appeals court in Detroit rules
that a GM policy barring fertile women from jobs that expose
them to lead is discriminatory. A decision by another appeals
court upholding battery maker Johnson Controls' narrower
exclusion of women of child-bearing age will get Supreme
Court review.</p>
<p>WHO WORKS LONGER? Female chief executives toil an average
56.2 hours a week, male counterparts 54.9 hours, a survey by
the Executive Committee shows. The San Diego firm polled 515
chiefs. In all, 40% of CEOs work 50 to 59 hours a week and
32% labor 60 to 69 hours.</p>
<p>THE `COMPENSATION PARTY' seems to be over, says consultant
Towers Perrin, reporting 1990 increases of about 7.6% in 13,
500 managers' salaries and bonuses, after rises of about 11%
in 1989. Gains had widened in recent years. Consultant
Korn/Ferry says the average draw of 689 polled executives was
$289,000 in 1989, up from $116,000 in a similar 1979 survey.</p>
<p>WHY WOMEN LEAVE: About two-thirds of employees who resign
from the federal government are women, says the Merit Systems
Protection Board. Women often depart for reasons unrelated to
work, many for family reasons. "More than a few" would have
stayed, if they'd had part-time work, the Board says.</p>
<p>SEND MORE IMMIGRANTS. The message is gaining legislative
steam.</p>
<p>A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee would let
840,000 immigrants annually into the U.S. for two years, up
from 540,000 now, then level off at 775,000. Visas for
permanent workers would be boosted to 75,000, or 188,000
including families, from a 54,000 total now. Employers would
pay a fee for use of immigrants; they'd have to attest that
they tried to recruit U.S. workers, rather than getting a
federal certificate for each immigrant.</p>
<p>A narrower bill passed last year by the Senate would allow
up to 150,000 employment visas a year, including families,
with 30,000 earmarked for professionals and skilled workers
and their kin. Bigger quotas are needed to update a 1965 law,
says Rep. Bruce Morrison (D., Conn.) chairman of the House
immigration subcommittee, the House bill's author. Some jobs
are going unfilled for lack of U.S. workers, he says.</p>
<p>The Bush administration opposes the House bill, as opening
immigration too much, but backs the Senate version.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: The AFL-CIO will urge a national health-care
policy in commercials starting Sept. 24 on such TV shows as
"Murphy Brown" and the "Cosby Show." . . . Fines assessed by
the Labor Department from child-labor-law raids in March and
June have reached $7.3 million.</p>
