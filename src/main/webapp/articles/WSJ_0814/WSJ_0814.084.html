	<p class="article-leader">Pesaro, Italy -- Every summer this home town of Gioacchino
Rossini's comes up with another obscure work by the master.
This is not so hard: Of the nimble-fingered master's 39
operas most used to linger in darkness, like the white
asparagus that are this region's other speciality.
   But since 1980, Pesaro's Rossini Festival has done much to
revive its favorite son's forgotten works. A loyal following
flocks here every August ready to embrace another resurrected
masterpiecelet in this town of modest charms on the Adriatic
coast. Together with the Rossini Foundation -- whose scholars
are publishing much-needed new editions of the composer's
much-mangled scores -- the festival has dusted off such faded
bel canto flowers as "Il Viaggio a Reims," "Ermione,"
"Tancredi," "Bianca e Falliero," "La Donna del Lago," even,
as a bit of cheeky defiance toward the Verdi everyone knows,
Rossini's "Otello."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now Pesaro has turned its attention to "Ricciardo e
Zoraide," which drifted from the stage not long after its
premiere in 1818. One was inclined to wonder why, as Riccardo
Chailly led the orchestra through an unusually scored
overture in which clarinets, flutes and horns engaged an
offstage band in melancholy discourse. The wonder passed
quickly enough. "Ricciardo e Zoraide" soon proved that it is,
after all, entirely possible to deserve your fate. "R&Z" is
mostly second-rate Rossini hitched to a libretto of nearly
unlimited idiocy.</p>
<p>Zoraide is an Asian princess living in the African kingdom
of Nubia where Ricciardo, a Christian knight, eventually
rescues her from Agorante, the chief Nubian. Neither comic,
nor tragic, "R&Z" belongs to that peculiar genre, the
"semi-seria" opera, which Beethoven attempted with somewhat
better results in "Fidelio."</p>
<p>At the premiere in Naples, "R&Z" was played in a grand
production of Aida-like dimensions with huge palaces and
exotic landscapes. The Pesaro production by the director Luca
Ronconi and designer-architect Gae Aulenti couldn't be more
different. Those who have seen Ms. Aulenti's rehabbing of
Paris's Musee d'Orsay know that hers is an elegant but tough
sensibility -- and thus a good match for Mr. Ronconi's
deflating attitude toward grand opera.</p>
<p>There is only one set, a starkly beautiful sand dune
surrounded by a cool white cyclorama. The lights shine so
brightly on this desertscape (simply constructed out of
rubberized material with glued-down sand) that you initially
close your eyes. The effect is intentional. The opera is
staged like a strange mirage in the desert with characters
slowly coming into view from beneath the sand on elevator
stages. The faintly comic Nubians are played by Czech
choristers in brown body paint. There is no suggestion of a
major civilization. All is fable. I don't think Tawana
Brawley would approve of this production.</p>
<p>As it happened, for other reasons, neither did Zoraide.
Little Pesaro is echoing with June Anderson's coughing as the
combination of sand and fixative fumes sent the exasperated
soprano to her allergy pills and her Ricciardo, William
Matteuzzi, to the hospital (briefly).</p>
<p>Well, beauty always has its price, though in this case,
the set did extract a rather high one: Decca/London decided
against recording the opera in part because the hydraulic
stages made so much noise during rehearsals. Actually, they
were drowned out nicely at the opening by improvised fans
deployed by a dripping audience trapped in a theater that got
to be hot as Nubia. Ms. Anderson had asked that the air
conditioning be turned off while she was on stage (wearing an
airy, veiled costume with sea-green pantaloons I wanted for
myself in a larger size). As we noticed with a peculiar
mixture of pleasure and sweat-filmed dread, Zoraide barely
ever leaves the stage.</p>
<p>Rossini wrote the part for Isabella Colbran, his mistress,
wife and later, ex-wife. She was said to have a powerful
personality and why she didn't nab the master by the ear and
shout: "Hey, Joe, you forgotta my aria]" is a mystery even
the Rossini Foundation's scholars probably can't solve. For
Zoraide has no major scene, though Ms. Anderson did finally
get to deploy her fabulously agile voice in an imaginatively
ornamented coloratura trio that stayed the rivulets for a few
moments. Along the way, there was a sensitively phrased duet,
"Ricciardo, che veggo," sung after Zoraide has discovered who
is hiding out underneath another veil.</p>
<p>Mr. Matteuzzi surprised me too. Based on recordings and
reports of his debut fiasco at the Metropolitan, I expected a
midget with a pinched voice. But the tenor easily dispatched
his high-flying music while looking tall and trim in the snug
breeches designed for him by the show's costumer, Giovanna
Buzzi.</p>
<p>Even more surprising was the Agorante, Bruce Ford. He got
the score 10 days before the opening after it was taken away
from tenor Chris Merritt, who arrived late without having
mastered a part all tricked out with coloratura and miles of
boring recitatives. In this feat of memorization, the young
Texan acquitted himself superbly, while showing a natural
affinity for the Rossini style, a secure top range and an
athletic set of legs adorned with little red ankle bracelets.</p>
<p>Besides the festival -- with its recitals, lectures, and
small exhibitions -- there is not all that much to do in
Pesaro, though some time can be wiled away eating a Pizza
Rossini slathered with eggs and mayonnaise and listening to
it cadenza in your stomach days later. The art museum
contains exactly one major work, but it is truly major-an
Assumption of the Virgin, elaborately framed and painted in
wondrously translucent colors by Giovanni Bellini. Nothing
but postcards remain of the town's other major monument, a
monster sphere with teeth by Arnoldo Pomodoro, which used to
glower in the seaside square. I hear the drunks who broke the
thing by rolling it down the street one night are local
heroes. (Could they please come to Manhattan and evict its
mutant sister from the plaza of the World Trade Center?) But
it will probably take an act of God to remove the concrete
hotels blighting the beach.</p>
<p>Earlier eras are recalled in a few handsome villas and the
small house in the Via Rossini where Gioacchino was born on
the first floor in 1792. (Close by is Via Tebaldi, an
architecturally undistinguished street recalling the famous
Pesarona and "Regata veneziana" singer, Renata Tebaldi). The
house is now a Rossini museum with surprisingly few mementos
of a long life that was lavishly eulogized at his huge
funeral in Paris in 1868. In the video room I watched part of
Pesaro's two-year-old production of "La Scala di Seta" ("The
Silk Ladder"). It seemed marginally more charming than the
revival I attended in the festival's smaller house, the
Auditorium Pedrotti, an un-airconditioned space -- not by
soprano fiat this time-outfitted with seats even more cramped
than the Teatro Rossini's. Rossini-sized persons are
encouraged to diet before visiting Pesaro.</p>
<p>At any rate, the eponymous ladder is dropped many, many
times by Giulia, an old man's ward. She drops it from her
balcony to receive the young man she has secretely married.
Other admirers use it too. The opera, written in 1812 for a
Venetian public, is meant to be funny. But it was not a great
hit at the premiere and was hissed at a revival a few years
later.</p>
<p>"Almost everything after its overture is anticlimactic,"
is what Herbert Weinstock, the composer's biographer, had to
say about "La Scala," though he might have changed his mind
had he seen Antonello Allemandi conduct it with ample
gestures befitting Beethoven's Leonore No. 3. An inventive,
tightly choreographed staging might have made a difference.
But neither the tenor, Oslavio di Credico, nor the soprano,
Nuccia Focile, had been given any comic turns by the director
Maurizio Scaparro, and were perhaps disinclined anyhow to
share our soggy state by capering energetically.</p>
<p>Maybe what "Scala" and "R&Z" needed most of all was that
Rossini speciality, the "aria di sorbetto," a little melody
sung by a secondary soloist while listeners revived
themselves with refreshments and blotted the sweat stains
from their outfits. Perhaps Philip Gossett, the editorial
director of the Rossini Foundation's critical editions, could
do us all a favor and come up with a tutti frutti assortment
to keep us going on hot nights.</p>
