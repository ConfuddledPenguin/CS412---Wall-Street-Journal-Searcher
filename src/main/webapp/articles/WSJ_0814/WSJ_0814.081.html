	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Signaling that the Navy must bear its share
of painful budget cuts, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
proposed scaling back plans to purchase superquiet Seawolf
submarines and the most advanced class of destroyers.
   The announcement, intended to cut about $7 billion from
Navy procurement plans through the mid-1990s, reflects the
harsh, long-term budget constraints facing each of the
services despite the current U.S. military buildup in Saudi
Arabia. The Seawolf attack subs and the Arleigh Burkeclass
guided-missile destroyers covered by Mr. Cheney's
announcement are among the most expensive and prized Navy
programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After a four-month review of major ship-construction
plans, Secretary Cheney proposed to cut annual Seawolf
purchases roughly in half and reduce to 16 from 25 the number
of destroyers slated to be built by 1995.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney also is expected to announce that he wants to
redesign and scale back the Army's controversial, $42 billion
plan to purchase a new generation of light helicopters,
Pentagon officials said. The results of the helicopter review
were expected to be announced along with the ship proposals,
but officials said Mr. Cheney is likely to release those
details as early as today.</p>
<p>There already has been strong pressure from Congress to
postpone purchases of the fast attack subs, which cost more
than $1.7 billion each and are to be built by General
Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat Division and Tenneco Inc.'s
Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. unit. Under the
Cheney proposals, some Pentagon officials said there still
would be enough Seawolf business to support two contractors.</p>
<p>By contrast, the destroyers so far have escaped serious
congressional budget-cutting efforts. The ships are built by
a unit of Litton Industries Inc. and closely held Bath Iron
Works.</p>
<p>While emphasizing that "current events remind us of how
fragile world peace can be," Mr. Cheney said he nevertheless
concluded that the Navy's original production plans should be
shelved in light of dramatic improvements in U.S.-Soviet
relations. Specifically, Mr. Cheney wants to reduce Seawolf
procurement to three vessels every two years from 10 vessels
every three years.</p>
<p>By embracing congressional proposals to eliminate at least
one of the two Seawolfs requested by the Navy in fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1, Mr. Cheney hopes to save $1.8 billion in
that year alone.</p>
<p>However, the Middle East crisis is expected to help the
Pentagon's budget in other ways. The Bush administration
apparently hopes to capitalize on the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait to deflect hefty troop cuts proposed for next year by
the Senate and the House Armed Services Committee. Senior
Army and Marine Corps officers, for instance, already are
privately warning congressional committees that eliminating
100,000 to 130,000 active-duty troops in 1991 could make it
difficult for the services to maintain the U.S. commitment to
the Saudis.</p>
<p>Even if lawmakers reject that argument, Pentagon officials
predict that the full House will restore some of the $5.9
billion the armed services panel slashed last month from
President Bush's request for maintenance, training and other
"military readiness" accounts.</p>
