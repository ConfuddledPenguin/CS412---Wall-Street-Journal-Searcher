	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office said the
Treasury's sale of zero-coupon bonds to Mexico involved "an
effective subsidy of approximately $192 million."
   The GAO, in findings to be presented at a House Banking
Committee hearing today, said the subsidy resulted from the
Treasury's decision to price the zero-coupon bonds based on
the coupon bond rate rather than the market rate for
comparable zero-coupon securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Allan Mendelowitz, director of international trade, energy
and finance issues for GAO, said in a statement prepared for
delivery to the House panel that the pricing method was
within Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's legal authority.
But he added that the GAO, Congress's investigative arm,
believes the pricing decision "was neither appropriate nor
good public policy."</p>
<p>Mr. Mendelowitz said that if the Treasury wanted to help
Mexico, "the correct way would have been to obtain
congressional approval through the authorization and
appropriations process, rather than with an effective subsidy
provided through the underpricing of the zeros."</p>
<p>The Treasury this year sold Mexico about $30 billion of
zero-coupon bonds as part of debt restructuring under the
so-called Brady Plan. Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a deep
discount to their face value and pay no interest until
maturity. The Treasury priced the bonds in relation to
conventional 30-year bonds rather than Strips, the
zero-coupon securities created in the marketplace when
dealers strip Treasury securities.</p>
<p>The pricing method was attacked by various lawmakers and
others as a backdoor subsidy, but was strongly defended by
the Treasury as appropriate.</p>
<p>"In the long run, this decision could set a precedent that
will cost the United States many times more than $192
million," Mr. Mendelowitz said. "The Mexico deal was the
first of many agreements anticipated under the Brady Plan."</p>
