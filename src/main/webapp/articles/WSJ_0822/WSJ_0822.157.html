	<p class="article-leader">Loral Corp. Chairman Bernard Schwartz, riding the winds of
war, said the outlook for the defense electronics concern is
bright and will only be improved by its recent acquisition of
Ford Motor Co.'s aerospace unit.
   Speaking with investors during a conference call with
Oppenheimer & Co., and then in a follow-up interview with
this newspaper, Mr. Schwartz said he expects second-quarter
profit to increase by about 7% from the same period last
year, not including any expenses associated with the Ford
Aerospace deal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the year-earlier second quarter ended Sept. 30, 1989,
Loral had profit of $19.8 million, or 79 cents a share, on
sales of $295.7 million.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1991, Mr. Schwartz added, he wouldn't take
issue with projections by securities analysts that the
company will earn about $85 million, or $3.45 a share, on
revenue of $1.45 billion. In fiscal 1990, the company had net
income of $78 million, or $3.11 a share, on sales of $1.27
billion. Backlog, he suggested, will climb slightly to more
than $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Loral's concentration in high-technology aircraft and ship
warning systems, reconnaissance and surveillance gear;
simulators and training devices; and intelligence and
communications equipment "distinguishes us to some degree"
from the defense contractors that are most affected by
military budget cuts, Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
<p>"That's true today, and it will be true tomorrow as well,"
he asserted.</p>
<p>The Persian Gulf crisis has only enhanced the company's
prospects. The Pentagon, according to Mr. Schwartz, already
has stepped up orders for chaff, or tiny strips of metal foil
dropped from aircraft that are used to confuse enemy radar.
He said the situation in the Middle East makes it more likely
that Loral will sell additional ALQ-178 radar warning
receivers and jamming instruments to Turkey.</p>
<p>Should the U.S. sell more McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-15
jets to Saudi Arabia, as many in the industry believe is
inevitable, that also would help Loral because the planes
would be outfitted with Loral electronics. Observers believe
Israel is also in the market for such components.</p>
<p>As tensions between the U.S. and Iraq continued to
heighten yesterday, the share prices of a number of
defense-electronics companies rose, even while the market
sank broadly. E-Systems Inc. closed on the New York Stock
Exchange at $27.125, up $1. Raytheon Co. finished on the Big
Board at $62.50, up $1.125, while Loral finished at $29, up
$1.</p>
<p>"What we have to see is if the fact that the Street has
warmed up to the stock is really sustainable or just a
trading spike," said Lior Bregman, the aerospace and defense
analyst at Oppenheimer.</p>
<p>Loral has attracted a lot of interest in the investment
community since it won the bid for Ford Aerospace last month.
Mr. Schwartz said yesterday that if the Newport Beach,
Calif., company's financial results were fully integrated
into Loral's, it would ultimately lift sales on an annualized
basis to $3.3 billion, backlog to $4 billion and profit to
nearly $100 million. But it's not clear how much, if any, of
Ford Aerospace's earnings actually will be consolidated on
that basis because the merchant banking partnerships of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. will hold a 49% stake in the
unit.</p>
<p>But whatever happens in terms of Loral's profit-and-loss
statement, Mr. Schwartz maintained, Ford Aerospace was a good
buy at $715 million. The company, which had $120 million in
pretax profit last year, only has about $20 million in debt
on its books that Loral will absorb. Even Ford Aerospace's
one traditional money-losing arm, missile systems, should
break even this year, Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
<p>"This is another example of Loral's acumen, luck, good
fortune or whatever," the chairman declared.</p>
