	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 6 editorial "Metzenbaum and Keating" declares,
without qualification or amplification, "Employees of Senator
Cranston's {voter registration} groups have since revealed
that they were routinely pressured to register only
Democrats." The allegation is completely false.
   In 1987 and 1988, I helped raise funds for a number of
nonpartisan voter-registration groups in California and
elsewhere. One of the California groups was the Center for
Participation in Democracy. The center had 535 employees and
scores of volunteers. Two of those employees, who worked out
of an office in Oakland, were reported in the press in August
1989 as having made the allegations you cite. I am aware of
no other such incidents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The center was scrupulous in instructing its people to
register everyone eligible, regardless of party preference,
and to avoid influencing the choice of party. As the law
permitted, the center concentrated much of its efforts in
minority areas, where voter registration is low and where
registrars have to "reach out" energetically if voter
interest is to be stimulated.</p>
<p>The center's nonpartisan performance cannot be faulted.
After the 1988 elections, a check with the secretary of state
and the county clerks of the most populous counties showed
that 67% of the voters processed by the center in those
minority areas registered Democratic; 33% registered
Republican, with other parties, or they declined to state.</p>
<p>That's hardly evidence of bias, and it compares favorably
with two other nonpartisan groups that also conducted
registration drives in minority communities. One of those
groups had 61% Democratic registrants; the other, 87%.</p>
<p>Bias can more legitimately be charged to the two
disgruntled employees who made the false accusations. The
press identified them as Lawrence Ross and Dino Blackburn.
Both had quit the center shortly before they were due to be
fired; Mr. Blackburn for, among other things, refusing to
register minority voters, and Mr. Ross for filing fraudulent
voter-registration affidavits.</p>
