	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. is speeding up
conversion of its network to digital technology, a move that
will help it compete in the tight three-way long-distance
phone race and help it keep costs down.
   MCI said its network will be fully digital by the end of
1991, two years ahead of schedule. Currently about 70% of the
carrier's network is digital, with most of the older analog
technology in the West and Northwest. Now, that equipment
will have to be written down.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Marketing is what this decision is about," said Edward
Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley &
Co. "Now they can claim they are all digital -- and they can
convert at attractive prices."</p>
<p>Unlike US Sprint Communications, which boasts an all
fiber-optics network, the MCI network will retain some
digital microwave facilities, primarily in the Rocky
Mountains. Digitalization will help MCI compete against
Sprint's marketing, which has focused on the greater
reliability and clarity of its fiber-optics network,
completed in 1988. Sprint is a unit of United
Telecommunications Inc.</p>
<p>At the same time, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has
moved aggressively to upgrade its network. At the end of
1988, the phone giant took a $6.7 billion write-down for
older technology and accelerated its plans for a network that
carries voice and data traffic digitally -- that is, in the
computer language of ones and zeros. Currently, AT&T's
network carries all but a tiny amount of its switched traffic
digitally, and by 1992, all private lines will be digital as
well.</p>
<p>"This removes the question of quality completely," said O.
Gene Gabbard, executive vice president and chief financial
officer of MCI, about the plan announced yesterday. "It is
the right thing to do and the right time to do it." In
addition to strengthening MCI's marketing position, he said
the conversion to a fully digital network will result in some
savings, as the older analog equipment is more expensive to
operate and maintain.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabbard, former chief executive officer of Telecom
USA, which merged into MCI earlier this month in a $1.25
billion transaction, said the conversion is "highly likely"
to result in a write-down of analog equipment in the third
quarter. The company said the write-down could total between
$500 million and $550 million.</p>
<p>"The big question is the final amount," Mr. Gabbard said.
The write-down, he said, "is not a final decision at this
point in time, but we're working diligently on it."</p>
<p>In response to the announcement about the possible
write-down yesterday morning, MCI stock fell about $2 a share
in active national over-the-counter trading, but later in the
day recouped most of the decline to close at $33.625 a share,
down $1.125.</p>
<p>As part of the digital-conversion plan, MCI is integrating
3,000 miles of optical fiber that belonged to Telecom USA and
has signed a long-term agreement with Williams
Telecommunications Group, a Williams Cos. unit, that gives
the companies access to each other's fiber networks. Terms of
the agreement, which replaces many contracts between WilTel
and MCI as well as Telecom USA, weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>For telephone users, digital technology delivers clearer
voice connections and more accurate data transmission than
analog technology. The benefits, however, aren't as
noticeable to residential consumers, who must make
connections through analog local telephone networks.</p>
<p>The long-distance carriers have an extra incentive to
upgrade as telecommunications increasingly becomes a global
business and U.S. companies try to maintain the technological
edge.</p>
<p>Frank Governali, an analyst with First Boston Corp., said
MCI needs to become fully digital for competitive purposes,
and "will be getting there two years early at no incremental
cost." MCI said it expects to complete its upgrade without
significantly increasing capital expenditures. The company
said it plans to spend about $1.1 billion on its network next
year.</p>
<p>For Williams, Tulsa, Okla., the new alliance with MCI
provides long-term benefits. Its WilTel unit is the nation's
fourth-largest long-distance carrier -- with an 11,000-mile
fiber optic network connecting most big cities. Over the
short term, the unit's 1991 revenue could shrink 10% to 15%
over 1989 levels, WilTel said.</p>
<p>That's still better than many analysts had predicted when
the MCI-Telecom USA merger was proposed in April. The two
companies have been WilTel's biggest customers, and that
business was expected to decrease drastically as Telecom USA
traffic migrated to the MCI network. Over the long haul,
however, MCI's renegotiated contract sets revenue minimums
that exceed the amounts in the earlier agreements.</p>
<p>"Instead of worrying about losing its biggest customers,
WilTel can sleep at night knowing they've got a positive
strategic partnership with MCI," said Jack Grubman, a
telecommunications analyst with PaineWebber Inc.</p>
