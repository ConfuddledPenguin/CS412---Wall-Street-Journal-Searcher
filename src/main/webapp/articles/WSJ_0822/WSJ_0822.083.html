	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Southdown Inc. said an arbitrator's ruling
calling for the company to pay Martin Marietta Corp. $10
million, plus interest in settlement of a contract dispute,
will result in a third-quarter charge.
   The amount of the charge wasn't disclosed and a
spokeswoman for the company wasn't available for comment. In
the year-ago third quarter ended Sept. 30, Southdown had net
income of $13.4 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of
$162 million. Results for the period included $3.7 million
from discontinued operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dispute centered on the lease of a cement plant in
Utah. Southdown said it had previously placed $10 million in
escrow, pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.</p>
