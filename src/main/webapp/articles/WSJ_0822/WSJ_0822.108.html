	<p class="article-leader">TDK Corp. said its consolidated pretax profit in the first
quarter ended June 30 rose 8.2% to 14.12 billion yen ($96.4
million) from 13.05 billion yen a year earlier.
   The Japanese electronic-part maker's net income climbed
15% to 6.72 billion yen, or 52.32 yen a share, from 5.85
billion yen, or 46.52 yen a share, a year earlier. Sales rose
15% to 128.5 billion yen from 112.16 billion yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales in TDK's recording media category, accounting for
31% of total sales, reached 40.37 billion yen, up 9.4% from
36.91 billion yen. In the category, officials noted that
overseas sales, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, were
strong enough to offset sluggish domestic sales.</p>
<p>TDK said total overseas sales were 68.28 billion yen, a
34% increase from 51 billion yen. Officials cited the yen's
depreciation as a reason for the rise.</p>
