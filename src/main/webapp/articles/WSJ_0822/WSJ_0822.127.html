	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- A former vendor for a Southern Co. unit who
made illegal political contributions on behalf of the
electric utility was fined $12,000 and sentenced to two years
probation.
   In June, Fred Suttles Jr., president of Outdoor Media
Inc., pleaded guilty in federal court here to filing a false
corporate tax return. He agreed to cooperate with a
continuing federal investigation of the affair.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Outdoor Media, an outdoor advertising firm in Pensacola,
Fla., rented billboard space to the Gulf Power Co. unit of
Southern. According to court papers, Mr. Suttles directed his
employees and several of his vendors to contribute $40,550 to
state and local political candidates designated by Gulf
Power; he then reimbursed the workers and vendors. The
income-tax charge relates to his listing those reimbursements
as legitimate business expenses.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service asserted that Mr. Suttles
agreed to the scheme to win Gulf Power advertising contracts.
The scheme was intended to circumvent federal law, which bars
utility holding companies from making political
contributions.</p>
