	<p class="article-leader">Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc. said it reached an
agreement with Seiko Instruments Inc. to distribute its
electronic reference products in Japan.
   Franklin, a leading producer of hand-held electronic
dictionaries and thesauruses with voice synthesizers, said it
is the first distribution agreement between the two
companies, although Franklin has long been a big buyer of
Seiko's liquid display crystals. It agreed to join hands with
Seiko after nearly two years of discussions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Morton E. David, chairman of Franklin, said he decided to
go with a distribution agreement rather than a licensing
agreement because he did not want to give away the company's
advanced software capabilities.</p>
<p>Although Mr. David said it is too early to set sales
targets for the Japanese market, he is optimistic that the
electronic reference products will become popular learning
tools for Japanese who are determined to learn English. The
devices use speech synthesis to pronounce U.S. English words.</p>
<p>Mount Holly, N.J.-based Franklin currently sells its
products in 33 countries.</p>
