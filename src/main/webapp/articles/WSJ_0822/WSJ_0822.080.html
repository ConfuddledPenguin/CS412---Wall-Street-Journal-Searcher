	<p class="article-leader">In regard to the Rev. J. Douglas Ousley's Aug. 3
editorial-page piece, "Free to Enjoy the Cruelty of the
Streets," on mentally ill homeless people: While his approach
is thoughtful, much of it is based on a false premise. He
assumes the only choices are to allow mentally ill people the
"freedom" to live on the streets or to institutionalize them.
But there are other options.
   As Mr. Ousley notes, the original plan behind the
"deinstitutionalization" was to provide community
mental-health clinics for released patients. The idea was
that many of the mentally ill could function in the community
provided they were given adequate support. The Federal
Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was to provide this
support in the form of federally funded, but community-based,
clinics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the second step was never implemented: Of the planned
2,000 clinics, fewer than 800 were funded. And because of lax
oversight, many of those did not serve the poor. As a result,
most deinstitutionalized patients were abandoned to the
streets.</p>
<p>However, the choice is not only between the streets and
reinstitutionalization. A third, much more effective approach
would be the community clinics originally promised. And with
them, the housing essential to any effective treatment.
Currently, small, nonprofit models successfully provide
supervised housing and mental-health services to the mentally
ill homeless. But leadership from Washington is needed.
Without it, such isolated "points of light" cannot possibly
meet the enormous need.</p>
<p>Yet the Bush administration is all rhetoric and no action,
stating recently that it opposes a legislative initiative --
led by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty --
that would help the mentally ill homeless get disability
benefits to which they are already legally entitled. Such
benefits could be used, with supervision provided for in the
law, to allow them to get both housing and treatment.</p>

<p>As a survivor of forcible psychiatric procedures, I must
challenge the benevolence of Mr. Ousley when he argues for
incarceration as a humane way "to get the mentally ill
homeless off the streets."</p>
<p>Many of us with psychiatric labels vote with our feet to
avoid traditional services, often just heavy dosages of
chemical straitjackets. Psychiatry must now compete with
other options for emotional support, including none at all.
The profession, and Mr. Ousley, seems surprised when we
prefer the gutter to psychiatry's degrading diagnoses,
coercive techniques, solitary confinement, restraints and
electroshock.</p>
<p>Mr. Ousley may discount my suggestions, coming from
someone with a diagnosis of "psychotic." However, a few model
services, such as community centers run by homeless people,
are attracting customers. These services respect human
rights, and even encourage consumer-ownership for those who
are ready. The person's real life needs are addressed.
Isolation, for example, is met with mutual support groups.
Also, money and homes are provided, to the extent that
shamefully limited resources are available.</p>
<p>It is easier for Mr. Ousley to attack the civil liberties
of psychiatric survivors, rather than the pocketbooks of
upper-income Americans, whose average annual income
skyrocketed during the "greed decade." His approach comforts
emotional distress all right: the guilty consciences of the
rich as they step over the homeless on the streets. If this
is Christian benevolence, I prefer to just say "No]"</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Ousley holds the commonly held erroneous belief that
the severely mentally ill are homeless because " . . . the
community-based outpatient clinics that were supposed to have
replaced {the state hospitals} have never materialized."</p>
<p>No objective evidence supports the contention that most of
the chronically mentally ill population can be successfully
managed in outpatient settings. The 1963 Community Mental
Health Act mandating community care was imposed without a
single long-term study of its efficacy.</p>
<p>The only proven way to ensure that the chronically
mentally ill can be safely housed, fed, clothed and treated
is long-term hospitalization. Anything else is wishful
thinking.</p>
