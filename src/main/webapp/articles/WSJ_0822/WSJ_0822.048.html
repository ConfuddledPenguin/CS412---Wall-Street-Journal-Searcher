	<p class="article-leader">PepsiCo Inc., following a successful offering of Kentucky
Fried Chicken stock in Japan, said it expects to take several
gains and charges in the third quarter that will result in a
net gain of $5 million.
   The snack food, soft drink and restaurant company, which
is based in Purchase, N.Y., expects to report a one-time gain
of $50 million after tax from the sale of stock in an initial
offering of its Kentucky Fried Chicken joint venture in
Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time, Pepsi will record several charges that
will total about $45 million after taxes. Among other things,
the charges cover the planned closings of certain
underperforming restaurants, and a provision for potentially
uncollectible receivables from certain retail customers.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier third quarter, Pepsi had net income of
$269.3 million, or $1.02 a share.</p>
<p>Under the offering of Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan stock,
Pepsi said it would report a pretax $86 million gain from the
sale of the 2.25 million shares and a $24 million equity gain
from the sale of two million new shares by the joint venture.
The Japanese business is a joint venture of Mitsubishi Corp.
and Pepsi.</p>
<p>Under the offering, which took advantage of high prices
provided by Japan's still-inflated stock market, each partner
will retain a 30.5% interest in the company. The shares were
sold at a price of 8,470 yen a share, or about $57 -- the
maximum offering price of the range set by the Japanese
Ministry of Finance, Pepsi said. The stock sale was the
largest initial public offering in Japan this year.</p>
<p>Partly because of its down-home Southern American image --
personified by the goateed Colonel Sanders -- Kentucky Fried
Chicken has been popular in Japan. Its first outlet opened 20
years ago, and with some 900 restaurants in the densely
populated country now, Kentucky Fried Chicken has grown to an
$800-million-a-year enterprise. Japan is the chain's largest
international market.</p>
<p>Leonard Schutzman, a Pepsi senior vice president, said
Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan plans to use the new capital to
expand operations in the Japanese market. Despite already
being Japan's biggest foreign fast-food chain, the company
has ambitious goals for the future. Management thinks the
Japanese market can sustain as many as 2,000 additional
Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets, according to a spokesman at
Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan.</p>
