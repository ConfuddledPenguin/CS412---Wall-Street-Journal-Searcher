	<p class="article-leader">SANAA, Yemen -- By deciding not to unload Iraqi oil from
ships arriving at its Aden port, this small country may have
stalled the outbreak of a shooting war in the Persian Gulf.
   "The U.S. wanted to pick a fight on this," but Yemen was
determined to avoid offering a pretext for conflict, says
Yemen Foreign Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yemen abstained in the United Nations Security Council on
the resolution calling for sanctions against Iraq. Now it has
shown that in practice it intends to observe sanctions.</p>
<p>"Everyone is taking it for granted that Yemen supports
Iraq," Mr. al-Iryani says, when in fact the country's
position opposes both the invasion of Kuwait and foreign
intervention to reverse it. "We support Iraq in confronting
this almost-crusade from the entire world. We feel that the
problem had other solutions than going to war."</p>
<p>He says foreign forces "are coming to destroy Iraq to get
it out of Kuwait. As Arabs, it is impossible to condone the
destruction of Iraq and the killing of hundreds of times more
Kuwaitis in the process than Iraq has done."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yemen forestalled a U.S. push to have the
Security Council approve the use of force to prevent
sanctions-busting when it said it would refuse to accept a
shipload of Iraqi crude. U.S. warships had fired warning
shots at two ships and tracked one of them as it sailed on
toward Aden. There had been a sense of urgency yesterday to
the U.S. request that the U.N. Security Council approve
military interdiction as the Iraqi tanker approached Yemen,
but Yemen's statement that it would adhere to the sanctions
cooled the atmosphere and no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>Yemen officials said that two ships carrying Iraqi crude
oil had been allowed to dock in Aden, but said they wouldn't
be allowed to unload. Yemen's stand is already proving costly
for this poorest of Arabian lands. Kuwaiti officials in
exile, seething over Yemen's abstentions in the U.N. and at
Arab meetings in Cairo, have canceled $10 million in annual
aid to Yemen's university and major hospital, Yemeni Foreign
Ministry sources said.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that Yemen also will have to close its Aden
oil refinery, which is supplied by Kuwaiti, Iraqi and some
Soviet crude. It has a capacity of 165,000 barrels a day, but
because it is about 33 years old, it generally runs at only
50% capacity.</p>
<p>"We weren't so lucky as the U.S.," says Mr. al-Iryani,
noting that Iraqi crude bound for the U.S. before sanctions
were imposed is permitted to unload. "Our ships were a little
bit late." Yemen, he says, would like to be considered for
compensation under U.N. provisions, "but we aren't blue-eyed
boys right now with the U.S., so they probably will do very
little to compensate us."</p>
<p>The foreign minister believes Yemen is suffering from a
crisis mentality among Gulf countries and the U.S. that says
"either you are with us or against us." In fact, he believes,
"with war or without war, the U.S. alone can't solve this
problem. Even if Iraq raises the white flag, the U.S. will
need uncommitted Arabs to help her."</p>
