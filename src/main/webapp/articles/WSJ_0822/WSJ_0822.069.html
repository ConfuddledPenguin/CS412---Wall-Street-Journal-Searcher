	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Call them bad-news bulls, investors who rush
in to snap up shares that have been depressed by lousy
earnings, lawsuits or other bad news.
   It's a risky stock-picking strategy, but one that may be
especially worth looking into if the buyers snapping up the
shares are also the ones running the company -- officers,
directors and other "insiders."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"From our standpoint, insider buying is a good indication
that this {bad news} was a one-time situation," said Ron
Rohe, chief operating officer of Baxter Financial Corp., a
Boca Raton, Fla., money-management firm. "While the Street
may get surprised, there's a pretty strong pattern of the
stock coming back after you see insiders buy."</p>
<p>So where are the insiders bullish despite bad news?</p>
<p>Consider four firms where Securities and Exchange
Commission filings show recent clusters of insiders buying
just as Wall Street was selling: United Telecommunications
Inc., a Westwood, Kan., communications company, Granada
BioSciences Inc., a Houston biotechnology concern, Diamond
Shamrock Inc., a Houston oil refiner, and James Madison Ltd.,
a Washington, D.C., bank-holding company. At three of the
four companies, the top purchaser was the chairman or
president.</p>
<p>United Telecommunications, parent of US Sprint, reported a
55% earnings plunge on July 17, triggering a 23% drop in the
price of its stock and prompting several shareholder
lawsuits. But two days later, Chairman William Esrey
purchased $138,150 of stock, SEC filings show. He bought
5,000 shares at $27.63 a share, increasing his total holdings
by 6%.</p>
<p>Five other United Telecommunications insiders followed his
lead with modest purchases later in the month, buying between
250 and 2,000 shares. The purchases increased their total
holdings by between 18% and 190%, SEC filings show.</p>
<p>Mr. Esrey was out of the country and couldn't be reached.
But Art Krause, the company's chief financial officer, summed
up the insiders' view: "We all feel that the market probably
overreacted, and we're very bullish." Mr. Krause increased
his own holdings in the company 31% with a 2,000-share
purchase on July 20.</p>
<p>The United Telecommunications insiders paid between $24.63
and $29.50 a share. In New York Stock Exchange trading
yesterday, the stock closed at $26, up 12 1/2 cents.</p>
<p>Similarly, four insiders at Diamond Shamrock bought shares
after the company reported July 18 that its second-quarter
earnings fell sharply. Net income skidded to 45 cents a
share, after write-downs, from $1.02 a year earlier, it said.</p>
<p>On July 23 and July 30, the company's chairman, Roger R.
Hemminghaus, purchased 1,250 shares, SEC filings show. He
said he "got them at bargain prices" of $22 a share or less.
That compares with the stock's $25 level as recently as June.</p>
<p>Mr. Hemminghaus said he also purchased 1,500 shares
earlier this month that he hasn't yet reported to the SEC. In
total, the shares cost about $60,000 and brought his holdings
to 55,828 shares.</p>
<p>Much of the company's earnings drop, according to Mr.
Hemminghaus, was due to a devaluation of its oil inventories
in light of falling crude-oil prices at the time. But the
value of those inventories could be raised this quarter, he
said.</p>
<p>The three other insiders at Diamond Shamrock bought 500 or
1,000 shares each, SEC filings show. All of them paid prices
ranging from $20 to $22 a share. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Diamond Shamrock closed at
$20.50, up 25 cents.</p>
<p>Granada BioSciences went public early this year. Insiders
have been on a buying spree ever since, SEC filings show,
even though the company has been losing money and its Granada
Corp. affiliate is embroiled in lawsuits. Altogether, six
insiders have purchased 89,900 shares since January at prices
ranging from $4.88 to $7, according to the filings. And, at
least on paper, they've all made money.</p>
<p>Darold McCalla, the company's president, has spent about
$200,000 on Granada BioSciences stock. "The initial offering
of the stock {at $7} was very close to its book value, so we
thought there was value the Street hasn't recognized," he
said.</p>
<p>Now, it "looks like the Street agrees with us," added
Kevin Gannon, the company's finance director, who has
purchased 26,700 shares this year. In American Stock Exchange
trading yesterday, Granada BioSciences closed at $10.25, down
25 cents.</p>
<p>Granada BioSciences reported a second-quarter loss of 26
cents a share, although that was an improvement over the
year-earlier loss of 73 cents a share. As for the lawsuits,
nearly 300 investors have sued Granada Corp. in connection
with 11 limited partnerships. Late last year, Granada Corp.
rolled those partnerships into two publicly held
corporations, one of which is Granada BioSciences. The
transaction made the former limited partners the holders of
about 45% of Granada BioSciences stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Gannon said Granada BioSciences has no liability for
the partnerships. Mr. McCalla declined comment on the suits.</p>
<p>Insiders have also been buying at James Madison, parent of
Madison National Bank. According to SEC filings, seven
company insiders made open-market purchases in May through
July, buying a total of 153,958 shares.</p>
<p>On July 19, the company reported that second-quarter per
share earnings dropped to seven cents from 10 cents a year
earlier. The company also suspended its 15-cent semi-annual
dividend.</p>
<p>The largest purchase was made by Ulysses Auger, a
director, who bought 87,258 shares in May and July. The
purchase brought his total holdings to 880,397 shares, SEC
filings show. He paid an average share price of $3.96, or a
total of $354,541, according to the filings. Mr. Auger
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The six other insiders bought between 200 and 25,000
shares at share prices ranging from $2.75 to $6. Of those,
three increased their holdings by more than 50%, SEC filings
show.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, James
Madison closed at $2.50, down 12 1/2 cents.</p>
