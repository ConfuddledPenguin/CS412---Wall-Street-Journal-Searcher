	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Medicare changes will reduce costs and paper
work for many patients, but doctors are fuming that the
reductions will be at their expense.
   Beginning Sept. 1, doctors and suppliers of medical
equipment will be required to file all Medicare insurance
claims for their patients at no charge. And on Jan. 1,
Medicare will impose new limits on doctors' fees, a change
designed to protect patients from excessive charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The American Medical Association opposes both measures as
burdensome to doctors. "Physicians spend more time responding
to rules, regulations and paper work than I sometimes think
they spend caring for patients," complains James Todd, the
executive director of the AMA.</p>
<p>But there's little chance the AMA will succeed in its
efforts to derail the changes. The provisions are part of a
physician payment reform plan that Congress passed last year
with the hope of slowing the double-digit growth of doctors'
bills paid by Medicare, the federal health insurance program
for 33 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries. Under the
law, a new, nationwide payment formula will be phased in
between 1992 and 1996.</p>
<p>Although the law applies mainly to doctors, several
provisions are designed to reduce burdens on Medicare
beneficiaries. In addition, the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs the $100 billion Medicare program,
is studying other improvements for beneficiaries. One
anticipated change is a new version of the so-called
Explanation of Medicare Benefits form.</p>
<p>Several hundred million of these forms are sent out each
year, making it one of the most common communications between
the government and the public. Yet many senior citizens
complain that the benefit notices are confusing,
uninformative and difficult to read. Congress's General
Accounting Office recently rapped the HCFA for not making the
forms easier to understand.</p>
<p>The Sept. 1 change will relieve beneficiaries of filing
Medicare claims. Officials at the HCFA and the AMA estimate
that doctors already file between 90% and 95% of the more
than 400 million claims submitted each year under Medicare
Part B, which covers services from doctors. Nevertheless, the
AMA has asked Congress to repeal the physician-filing
requirement, complaining that it "will add increased
administrative costs to the physician practice."</p>
<p>But the measure has strong support from senior citizen
groups. The American Association of Retired Persons has
organized 3,200 volunteers in 37 states to help people deal
with Medicare; 14% of the people served need help filing
Medicare claims. "One of our big problems is helping people
file their initial claims with Medicare," says Bob Jackson,
who runs the assistance program.</p>
<p>Some elderly patients find Medicare so complex that they
don't bother to file claims. The Physician Payment Review
Commission, a federal agency, estimates that about one
million people a year don't seek reimbursement because filing
"is too complicated or too time-consuming." Physician-filing
will increase benefits to such people by about $100 million
annually, the agency calculates.</p>
<p>In addition, the AARP reports that many seniors complain
that doctors levy charges for filing Medicare forms. Such
filing fees, which range up to $10 a claim, will be banned as
of Oct. 1.</p>
<p>One reason Congress imposed the new requirement was to
improve efficiency by reducing the number of errors in
Medicare filings, which are processed for HCFA by 34
insurance companies. The GAO estimates that last year 45
million claims -- 11% of all those filed -- lacked
information needed to process them. Most of these claims were
filed by physicians and other providers, rather than by the
beneficiaries themselves. The HCFA is currently working with
insurance companies to improve error-reduction programs, an
area in which the GAO said the agency has been deficient.</p>
<p>The other major change will place uniform new limits on
what physicians can charge Medicare patients, starting Jan.
1. When doctors deal with Medicare patients, they can choose
between two basic billing procedures. They can accept the
patient "on assignment," which means that they will charge
the patient only what Medicare allows for the procedure, send
their bill to the insurance company that handles Medicare
claims in their area and receive reimbursement. About 80% of
Medicare's claims are submitted on assignment.</p>
<p>Doctors using the second method, called balance billing,
charge more than the Medicare reimbursement rate, meaning
that the patient must pay the difference between what
Medicare pays and the higher amount the doctor charges. (In
both cases, Medicare pays 80% of approved doctors' bills,
requiring the patient to pay a 20% co-payment; many seniors
have private supplemental insurance, called Medigap, that
pays the co-payment.)</p>
<p>Last year, balance billing charges paid by patients and
insurers totaled $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Starting Jan. 1, the maximum doctors can charge under
balance billing will be 125% of the Medicare reimbursement
rate. That cap will fall to 115% by 1993. The new limits will
replace a complex system that HCFA officials admit almost
nobody understands.</p>
<p>The AMA opposes the limits. "We don't believe that
physicians should be subject to arbitrary billing limits,"
the organization told Congress last month. "The 1991 balance
billing cap could cause serious reductions in the fees
physicians would otherwise be allowed to charge,"
particularly in rural areas.</p>
<p>But senior citizens groups strongly support the new caps,
which will reduce balance billing payments for some patients.
In addition, the change will make it easier for patients to
protect themselves from excessive charges. The combination of
the evolving nationwide fee schedule and the cap will enable
insurance companies to tell patients subject to balance
billing the maximum their doctors can charge. This
information isn't currently included on the Explanation of
Medicare Benefits form because each doctor has a different
maximum for each procedure.</p>
<p>The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and
Medicare, which represents senior citizens, has asked the
HCFA to include the maximum allowed charges on benefit forms,
along with a note that beneficiaries subject to balance
billing don't have to pay any more.</p>
<p>It has also urged the HCFA to take other steps "to help
demystify Medicare reimbursements." One proposal is that the
HCFA adopt a standard nationwide form. Currently, the
insurance companies that process Medicare claims issue
different forms, and seniors who travel sometimes find it
difficult to match them up.</p>
<p>In its report, the GAO called the current forms confusing
because they don't clearly describe benefit decisions or the
medical services for which reimbursement is being made.
Beneficiaries made about 19 million inquiries to their
carriers last year, in part because of "confusion about the
information presented on the notices," the GAO said.</p>
<p>The HCFA is launching an effort to redesign the benefit
form for use starting Jan. 1, 1992. "I would think if they
really chose, they could get it out sooner," says Martha
McSteen, president of the National Committee.</p>
