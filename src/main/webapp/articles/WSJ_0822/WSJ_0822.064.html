	<p class="article-leader">WARREN, N.J. -- Celgene Corp. said it received a patent on
an unusual technique for boosting the safety and efficacy of
a broad category of drugs and chemicals.
   The little biotechnology company, formerly part of
Celanese Corp., said it had developed processes for purifying
an amine compound so that all its molecules are of the same
shape, or "handedness." Amines are compounds that are
basically derived from the ammonia molecule. They include the
amino acids that compose all proteins as well as a wide
variety of heart drugs, antibiotics, anti-depressants as well
as farm chemicals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many amines come in two molecular shapes that, like the
right and left hands, are mirror images of each other. The
Celgene processes can ensure that all of a product's amine
molecules are either the left-handed version or the
right-handed version, whichever is desirable, the company
said.</p>
<p>The handedness of an amine can affect the chemical's
effectiveness and its safety, Sol J. Barer, Celgene vice
president for technology, said. For example, the synthetic
sweetener aspartame, sold as NutraSweet by a subsidiary of
Monsanto Co., is composed only of the left-handed versions of
two amino acids. Only the left-handed versions taste sweet;
the right-handed versions of the same two amino acids taste
bitter, a Nutra-Sweet spokesman confirmed.</p>
<p>Many medicines and chemicals are a mixture of the
left-handed and right-handed forms of amines and this may
account for some drugs having both beneficial as well as
adverse effects, the company explained. A prevailing theory,
for example, holds that thalidomide was both a highly
effective sleeping pill and a drug that produced severe birth
defects because it was a mixture of both the right-handed and
left-handed versions of the same molecule, Mr. Barer noted.</p>
<p>Similarly, the potency of some medicines is diluted by the
presence of the inactive version of the molecule. Potency can
be boosted and the dosage of the drug reduced by purifying it
to the active version of the molecule, the company said.</p>
<p>Celgene said its new patent covers the use of special
bacterial enzymes to separate the left-handed versions of
amines from the right-handed versions. The enzymes also can
be used to produce only one version of an amine from a
chemical raw material. Thus, Mr. Barer explained, once an
undesirable version of an amine is culled out of the
compound, it can be recycled into the more desirable version.</p>
<p>The company said it had identified more than 500
pharmaceutical compounds that are candidates for the new
process.</p>
