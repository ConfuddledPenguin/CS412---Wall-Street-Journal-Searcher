	<p class="article-leader">Nine years ago Israeli aircraft destroyed the Baghdad
facility from which Saddam Hussein expected to obtain the
plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The breathtaking accuracy of
the Israeli air force was admired privately in defense
ministries around the world. But most governments denounced
the Israeli action.
   Had Israel not sent its planes against the Osirak reactor,
our world would be a different and far more dangerous one
today. Saddam could have marched into Kuwait with the "try
and stop me" swagger that would come from nuclear weapons
added to his already formidable arsenal of nerve gas and
hostages. Nuclear weapons, once thought of as the "great
equalizer," must now be seen differently. They are one thing
in the hands of governments animated by rational policies to
protect national interests and a normal regard for human
life. They are quite another in the hands of a brutal
megalomaniac like Saddam who wouldn't blink at the mass
destruction of his "enemies."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So nine years later we -- this time it's our turn -- had
better be prepared to do it again. The destruction of Iraq's
nascent nuclear capability together with its capacity to
build chemical weapons should be the first priority of
American policy in the current crisis. The restoration of
Kuwaiti sovereignty and the total withdrawal of Iraqi forces
from Kuwait are important. But stopping Saddam from obtaining
nuclear weapons is more important still. If this crisis ends
with Iraq's nascent nuclear capabilities and chemical-weapons
production facilities and stockpiles intact, the Western
world will have made a mistake of historic proportions.</p>
<p>It took the U.S. four days to decide that Iraq's brutal
invasion of Kuwait was unacceptable. How long would it have
taken the American president to respond -- and who would have
joined us -- if Saddam had nuclear weapons? Would the U.S.
have sent 100,000 troops within range of Iraqi nuclear
missiles? With nuclear weapons Saddam would rule the Gulf and
control the world's supply of oil.</p>
<p>In the years since Israel acted to enforce the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty in the only way Saddam respects,
Iraq, with help from America's allies, has rebuilt its
nuclear facilities, burrowing deep underground and deploying
massive air defenses to protect them. Meanwhile, Iraq is
trying to obtain the ballistic missile technology that would
enable a nuclear weapon to be delivered over great distances.
One would think that there would be a concerted effort by
Iraq's potential victims to thwart these nuclear missile
ambitions.</p>
<p>Yet less than a month ago, at the last minute and over the
strenuous objections of the Commerce Department (which had
previously approved the deal), the U.S. stopped the shipment
to Iraq of a $15 million sophisticated metallurgical furnace
said to be for the manufacture of titanium alloy prosthetic
devices. The furnace was actually intended to advance
Saddam's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p>
<p>Ariane, the French-led European space consortium, is now
assisting Brazil in the development of a ballistic missile
"for civilian space purposes." Brazil, in turn, has been
supplying Saddam with missiles derived from earlier
European-supported "civilian" programs. The U.S. is on the
verge of authorizing the sale to a Brazilian company involved
in missile development of a largely unsafeguarded
supercomputer. It will almost certainly be put at the service
of its missile development program. (At the same time, we
have, for more than two years, refused licenses for Israeli
universities to purchase supercomputers that they are willing
to place under any set of restrictive safeguards the U.S.
desires.)</p>
<p>Even the chemical weapons with which Saddam now threatens
to destroy Israel, American forces in the Gulf or anyone else
who stands in his way are derived, in large part, from
Western suppliers of technology and precursor chemicals. The
West Germans' lax regime of export controls and deliberately
anemic enforcement has been most egregious. But they are not
alone.</p>
<p>If American troops come under attack from Iraqi chemical
weapons in 1990 (or Iraqi nuclear weapons later), myopic
Western greed, nurtured by policy confusion and bureaucratic
incompetence, will bear much of the blame.</p>
<p>When the current crisis is over, it should be a priority
American policy to strengthen significantly controls over the
export of sensitive technology to Iraq and to insist that our
allies do the same. But even a strictly enforced,
comprehensive export control regime would be unlikely to stop
Iraq's nuclear and chemical programs at this late stage in
their development. That is why an air attack on the
facilities is an essential first step to putting the Iraqi
genie back in the bottle. The cork of export controls should
follow.</p>
<p>If we are to destroy Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons
potential through military action and export controls, we
need to organize our allies accordingly.</p>
<p>The NATO allies (with the Soviet Union, Iraq's principal
suppliers of military equipment and technology) have long
insisted that the Gulf is outside NATO's "area" and thus not
subject to coordinated NATO policies or actions. As the dire
threat to the European economies of war and turbulence in the
Gulf has long been obvious, the U.S. has long encouraged NATO
to think about, and plan for, contingencies in the Gulf like
the war and occupation now under way.</p>
<p>Until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the American effort to
broaden NATO's horizon had largely failed. Even as Iraqi
occupation forces round up hostages and Saddam instigates a
holy war against Western interests, West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose country is dependent
on Middle East oil, cowers behind an interpretation of the
German constitution that would preclude Germany joining its
allies in the Gulf. And the French, whose cynical alliance
with Iraq has helped to make Saddam a military power, were
openly critical of the American blockade until joining it
this week. (President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that
France would send ground forces to the United Arab Emirates
in response to the Persian Gulf crisis.)</p>
<p>Britain, however, has behaved admirably in the current
crisis. So have some others. Turkey gets half its oil through
the Iraqi pipeline it closed in support of the U.N. sanctions
and it trades extensively with Iraq. Although it has a great
deal to lose, Turkey has courageously stood with the U.S.,
doing more for the security of the European Community than
many of the community's own members.</p>
<p>The silver lining in the cloud of Saddam's invasion of
Kuwait may be a long-overdue realization on the part of some
NATO allies that they have important interests outside
central Europe whose protection may require the exertion of
military power. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney has been
arguing this theme persuasively within NATO councils. He can
now do so with the credibility that comes from demonstrated
prescience.</p>
<p>The cohesion of the advanced industrial powers is
essential to any effective administration of export controls.
This can be obtained only through a combination of argument
and, where necessary, the sort of pressure that the world's
largest market and principal supplier of technology can apply
-- when it has a mind to. What has been lacking is clarity
and will on the part of the U.S. American ambivalence has
been evident in the continuing differences between the
departments of Commerce and Defense and the action of the
Congress in pressuring a pliable and divided administration
to decimate controls on the export of sensitive technologies
to countries where they will be used for military purposes.
In this situation it is hardly surprising that venal German
and craven French exporters have elicited commercial envy at
the Commerce Department and met acquiescence at the State
Department.</p>
<p>For the more immediate task, the destruction of Iraq's
present -- as opposed to its future -- weapons programs, the
support of America's allies, while desirable, is not
essential. The U.S. has the air power to do the job alone.
While some logistic support, like the use of European bases
from which to stage air strikes, would be helpful, we should
not be deterred by reluctance on the part of countries that,
having been part of the problem, now wish to escape becoming
part of the solution.</p>
<p>As for diplomatic support, it would be nice if we could
get it -- but not if we have to pay for it by ending the
current crisis with a face-saving tactical retreat by Saddam
that would enable him to fight another day. The opinion of
Hans-Dietrich Genscher is a fly speck alongside the Western
interests that are at stake in toppling Saddam by destroying
his military potential and, in so doing, making it plain that
we will not allow nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of
international thugs.</p>
<p>Saddam will not be the last menace to Western interests,
and he is certainly not the most formidable. The most
formidable threat to our well-being would be a Saddam in
possession of true weapons of mass destruction and prepared
to use them to extort power and wealth from those unable to
defend against them or deter their use. In any contest in
which one side is bound by the norms of civilized behavior
and the other is not, history is, alas, on the side of the
barbarians. This is a lesson to remember before we cancel the
B-2 bomber and thereby give up the capability to destroy
targets safely anywhere in the world without requiring
foreign bases.</p>
<p>An attack on Iraq's nuclear and chemical facilities will
not be cost-free. But in the long run, sparing them will
prove even more costly. President Bush deserves to know that
he will have bipartisan support for a policy that recognizes
this.</p>
<p>We have a narrow choice: Fly now or pay later.</p>
