	<p class="article-leader">NEFTEYUGANSK, U.S.S.R. -- The Mammoth oil field on the
edge of this Siberian town is aptly named: Beneath the swampy
surface lie some of the biggest oil reserves in the world.
But even mammoths grow old and sick.
   Oil production at the 20-year-old field has dropped almost
25% since hitting its peak in 1988. Alexander Gusev, the
chief engineer, says raising production is out of the
question. Even slowing the decline is proving troublesome
because of chronic shortages of such basic equipment as pipes
and valves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Supplies of those things have dried up because of ethnic
unrest in Azerbaijan, where most of them are made. "We've had
problems every day," Mr. Gusev sighs. "Using old equipment
means more accidents and higher repair costs."</p>
<p>The oil patch of Western Siberia, the source of almost
two-thirds of Soviet output, is in trouble. As the world's
largest oil producer and a major exporter, the U.S.S.R.
stands to profit handsomely from the rise in prices following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Every $1 increase in a barrel of
crude oil means as much as $1 billion a year in additional
Soviet export revenue.</p>
<p>But don't count on Moscow's pumping more to capitalize on
the Middle East crisis, as it did during the oil shocks of
the 1970s. Although Soviet oil reserves total more than 60
billion barrels, more than double America's, many of the
overtaxed Soviet fields have fallen into irreversible
decline.</p>
<p>The reasons range from big fields reaching maturity, to
inefficient extraction methods and problems with equipment.
Much of the gear is outdated. A lot of money has been spent
for Western equipment, but some of it sits idle, Western
analysts say. Pipelines and other parts of the
oil-transportation system aren't adequate, and accidents and
spills are frequent.</p>
<p>At the same time, the cost of pumping oil from new wells
is soaring, straining already strapped Soviet finances. The
Kremlin, reversing its investment policy of the past 20
years, is actually cutting back capital spending on the oil
industry.</p>
<p>While such problems mean Soviet oil won't be able to make
up for the lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti supply, they do present the
West with a big opportunity. The Kremlin has long insisted on
developing its oil resources alone, guarding industry details
like military secrets. That is starting to change as Mikhail
Gorbachev opens the economy to the West. For beleaguered
Siberian oil officials, the prospect of cooperation with
Western companies is one bright spot on an otherwise dark
horizon.</p>
<p>How dark? Last year, total Soviet energy output declined
for the first time since the 1940s. Western analysts believe
oil output fell 2.5%, to an average 12.1 million barrels a
day.</p>
<p>Soviet experts say it may soon drop below 12 million
barrels, to its lowest level in over a decade. But Western
experts say it's already below that, and see a slippage to
less than 11 million barrels a day before 1995. An even more
pessimistic projection comes from a senior Estonian
scientist, Mikhail B. Korchemkin, who sees daily Soviet
output falling to just over 10 million barrels by 1995, and
then, by 2010, to nine million.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is trying to give priority to exports,
which account for about a third of production and bring in
much of the nation's hard currency. But it has recently cut
sales to Eastern Europe to keep supplies flowing to its own
energy-hungry economy and the West.</p>
<p>Even though Moscow has drawn down domestic inventories to
try to maintain exports, those exports have fallen from the
1988 peak of 4.1 million barrels a day to an estimated 3.7
million a day last year. Of this, about 1.7 million barrels a
day went to the West and two million to Eastern Europe. This
year, the Soviets have cut East Europe deliveries 140,000
barrels a day.</p>
<p>Robert Ebel, an Ensearch Corp. executive and former U.S.
intelligence expert on Soviet energy, sees Soviet oil exports
falling another 400,000 barrels a day in 1990.</p>
<p>Although no cure-all, the Soviets' hopes for joint
ventures with Western oil companies offer promise. Such
ventures could give them both the technology and the capital
they need.</p>
<p>"Tell the Americans and anyone else that they should come
to us. They're welcome," says Anatoly Tyukalov, deputy head
of Glavtyumenneftegaz, the body that oversees Western
Siberia's oil and gas industry. "We need new technology and
new equipment to get oil out more cheaply. That means we want
your capital, your technology, your credits."</p>
<p>Western oil companies have been quick to respond. This
month, 15 officials from Mr. Tyukalov's organization were
flown to the U.S. by Du Pont Co.'s Conoco unit. Oil giants
such as Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Amoco Corp. and
oil-service firms such as Halliburton Co. are trekking to
Siberia in hopes of getting access to Soviet oil through
joint ventures.</p>
<p>So far, however, there is little to show for the flurry of
activity. The talks are often laborious, Westerners complain,
and many Soviet oil officials continue to harbor deep-rooted
suspicion of Western motives. Rather than giving the
foreigners free rein, officials want them to work on fields
that are tricky and expensive to exploit.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of
oil is in a chaotic state because of the government's
attempts to restructure the economy. The Oil Ministry last
year merged with the Gas Ministry, its longtime rival. But
the super-agency that emerged may not have long to live
itself; officials say one option is to replace it with a
government committee.</p>
<p>Moreover, since Boris Yeltsin became president of the
Russian Republic in May, the question of who controls
Siberian oil has been thrown into doubt. The republic's
parliament recently stipulated that it must approve any
natural-resources ventures negotiated by Soviet authorities.
And this week, Russian officials even held out the prospect
that they would be interested in joining the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
<p>This confusion is hard on foreign oil companies trying to
get a Soviet foothold. Do they need separate agreements with
separate republics? If they sign an agreement with the
Ministry of Geology, as Texaco Inc. did recently, will it
hold with the other ministries? (Texaco's agreement is to
explore areas of the Timan-Pechora region, straddling the
Arctic Circle, where Texaco estimates oil reserves could be
more than five billion barrels.)</p>
<p>With perseverance, some Westerners have managed to
navigate this maze. One of them is Canadian Fracmaster Ltd.,
a Calgary-based oil-services company with a technique to
recover oil from wells damaged during drilling.</p>
<p>In March 1989, the company set up a joint venture with the
oil-production enterprise here. The Canadian company provides
most of the equipment and several oil specialists to oversee
the process.</p>
<p>Unlike in the West, where it would normally be paid for
its services on a contract basis, Fracmaster is paid
according to the amount of additional oil that flows from the
wells it has treated. The joint venture has treated about 100
wells and recovered about 300,000 tons of additional oil, but
it is not yet profitable.</p>
<p>Monty Meikle, chief of technology for the venture, says
work tends to be slower than in the West, with jobs that
could be done in one week taking two to three. One of the
biggest problems is long waits for Soviet equipment that the
venture uses, such as trucks, surface rigs and fluid tanks.
Still, Mr. Meikle says, "as we get to know each other, things
improve and move more to our standards."</p>
<p>The Soviets are in dire need of such sophisticated
drilling and recovery methods. For years, the government and
oil workers paid scant attention to the efficiency of
extraction techniques; oil was so abundant they didn't need
to bother.</p>
<p>In the rush to pump as fast as possible, drilling was
often slapdash and led to frequent damage of the wells.
Poor-quality pipes often corrode or are damaged by careless
workers, leading to an estimated seven million barrels of oil
being spilled on Siberian soil every year.</p>
<p>The Soviet oil-equipment industry, too, ignored the needs
of smaller fields, concentrating on providing for huge
fields. Now, as some big fields reach maturity and new ones
become harder to find, such neglect is returning to haunt the
industry.</p>
<p>"Most of our sources were wrongly exploited," says
Alexander Arbatov, an oil expert at the Soviet Academy of
Sciences. "We have a very low technical level, and haven't
improved our standards." As a result, he says, "production is
falling faster than we expected."</p>
<p>For Prof. Arbatov and some other Soviet experts, such
technical problems are merely the tip of the iceberg. They
contend that the Kremlin's entire energy strategy over the
past 20 years has been flawed.</p>
<p>Since oil was first exploited in Western Siberia in the
mid-1960s, the government has poured billions of dollars into
the region in order to pump as much as possible. The
resulting revenues from exports, particularly following the
oil price surges of the 1970s, kept the economy afloat.</p>
<p>Economics is dictating a drastic change of policy. When
oil prices started falling in the mid-1980s, the newly
appointed Mr. Gorbachev initially chose traditional methods
to offset the shortfall in revenue: more money to pump more
oil.</p>
<p>But that policy proved prohibitively expensive. According
to internal government figures, the cost of extracting Soviet
oil -- now mostly from smaller fields, which are harder to
exploit -- has almost tripled since 1985. Last year, the
Kremlin slammed on the brakes. Investment in the oil sector,
along with capital outlays to other industries, was pared
back heavily.</p>
<p>Critics say the move came too late. Over the years, they
say, some of the huge amount invested in oil would have been
better spent on other sectors of the economy, especially
production of consumer goods. At the same time, heavy
subsidies on energy allowed the nation's industry to get
hooked on cheap oil.</p>
<p>As a result, consumption surged. In all energy, the Soviet
Union consumes the equivalent of nearly 28 million barrels of
oil a day, more than all of Western Europe and second only to
the U.S.</p>
<p>Alexei Makarov, director of the Institute of Energy
Research at the Academy of Sciences, says the government
needs to triple domestic energy prices just to bring them
into line with actual costs. But such a move is politically
tricky at a time of growing social unrest.</p>
<p>Here in Nefteyugansk, a town of 140,000 whose name means
"Oil South," local officials are equally critical of past
policy. Government spending in the area doubled between 1980
and 1988, but most of it went to the oil industry, not the
pressing social needs of residents.</p>
<p>One tenth of the town's population is on the waiting list
for better housing. There is a dire shortage of hospitals and
schools. Oil workers here and throughout Western Siberia
threatened to strike earlier this year to protest poor living
conditions. They backed off after the government gave them
some hard currency from oil revenues to buy imported meat.</p>
<p>Vladimir Solomin, deputy director of the town's
oil-producing enterprise, would like his company to become
independent both of Moscow and of the oil authorities in
Tyumen, 600 miles to the south. "We must use the oil we
extract to improve social conditions," he says. "Cooperation
with foreign partners is thus very important."</p>
<p>Foreign oil companies are eager. With prospects rapidly
shrinking elsewhere, they see the U.S.S.R. as a new frontier.</p>
<p>France's state-owned Elf Aquitaine announced the first
major exploration and production agreement with the Soviets
-- although, like most agreements, it's not in Siberia, where
the oil is easiest to exploit. It was to give Elf the right
to drill on 13,500 square miles of territory north of the
Caspian Sea near the Volga River. Or so it seemed. Elf's
president said later that many details still had to be worked
out.</p>
<p>Then, last June 2, while Mr. Gorbachev was in the U.S.,
Chevron Corp. signed a declaration of intent to explore and
develop regions including the giant Tengiz field -- the
biggest discovered in the world in the past 10 years,
according to Soviet authorities. Its potential reserves are
estimated at 25 billion barrels, almost equal to all the
proven reserves of the U.S.</p>
<p>Chevron can provide the equipment and the management
skills the Soviets lack, says Edward B. Scott II, vice
president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., who calls
Soviet equipment "30 years behind us." But he says developing
the field will be difficult. The Soviets have invested $1
billion so far, he says, and much more will be necessary. The
field itself has high pressure, and there is a high
concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the gas -- a dangerous
substance in an oil field if not handled correctly.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott says Chevron has been in "intense negotiations"
for more than a year. It has brought groups of Soviet
authorities, including the top official of the province, to
the U.S. and taken them on tours of facilities. It brought
the minister of petroleum to the U.S. But it still doesn't
have a final agreement with the Soviets.</p>
<p>Some smaller oil companies and oil-service concerns are
succeeding in carving out niches. Anglo-Suisse Inc. of
Houston has formed a joint venture company with the Soviets
called White Knight. It drills horizontal wells -- extremely
helpful in reviving oil fields thought to be worn out. It is
studying the feasibility of drilling as many as 450
horizontal wells. It will share in the oil recovered.</p>
<p>Under a recent agreement between Texas-based Halliburton
and the Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas, a Soviet ship is
sailing the Chukchi Sea collecting seismic data for future
oil exploration. The data will be packaged for sale to
Western oil companies.</p>
<p>But until more foreign oil companies come to the region,
officials here admit their daily struggle with the
uncertainties of the Soviet economy will continue.</p>
<p>One morning, Mr. Solomin drives out to the Mammoth oil
field with a visitor and Mr. Gusev, the field's chief
engineer. On the way, they stop to inspect a well.</p>
<p>The Romanian-made rig isn't moving.</p>
<p>"Why isn't it working?" Mr. Solomin asks.</p>
<p>"Repairs," Mr. Gusev replies.</p>
<p>Mr. Solomin, embarrassed to show off something that isn't
functioning, turns to his visitor and tries to shrug it off.</p>
<p>"They'll be here tomorrow to fix it," he says, hopefully.</p>
