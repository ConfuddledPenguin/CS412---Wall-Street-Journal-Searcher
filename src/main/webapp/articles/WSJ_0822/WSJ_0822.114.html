	<p class="article-leader">Dun & Bradstreet Corp., New York, said it is putting up
for sale the medical publishing division of its IMS
International unit, as it continues to divest itself of
nonstrategic businesses.
   The communications division of IMS International publishes
medical journals and provides marketing and consulting
services for the pharmaceutical industry. The division had
revenue of $125 million in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>D&B said that while the division is profitable, it wants
to focus D&B's investments in IMS International's core market
research business. IMS International was acquired in May 1988
in a transaction valued at $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The financial-information services company said it still
expects 1990 earnings to be around $2.80 a share.</p>
