	<p class="article-leader">The lesson of Vietnam is, don't get involved in any wars
you don't intend to win. The goal of the U.S. and its
supporting forces in the Persian Gulf should be just that --
to win. Settling for a lesser goal is a recipe for
catastrophe on the ground and political recrimination later.
Vietnam took years to teach us that truth.
   Military doctrine has always been to deploy force
decisively. According to a World War II military adage on
keeping casualties down, if you need a squad for a mission,
then send in a battalion, and if you need a battalion, send
in a division. In Vietnam, we found that bombing Hanoi was
the only way we could make progress even in negotiations. In
the pre-nuclear age, any military man would have seen the
answer in Vietnam as a massive invasion of the north. We
didn't invade because of the danger of superpower
intervention; MacArthur had done it in North Korea, but the
Chinese intervened. "Superpower," of course, has been a
codeword in the postwar period for massive nuclear
capability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, however, Iraq has no superpower protector. With
Moscow subtracted from Saddam's calculations, his network of
support has shriveled. Even Libya's Gadhafi has just called
in reporters to issue a condemnation of Iraq's
hostage-taking, which suggests that these nasty folks are
increasingly being left on their own.</p>
<p>Iraq does not have the reserves for a long war; many of
the reserves it does possess have already been absorbed into
the army. The fact that Saddam has somewhat artificially
pumped up his army's strength in this manner may account for
the growing doubts about Iraqi military morale; two pilots
have defected, and there have been reports, though difficult
to confirm, of defections by some tank commanders.</p>
<p>The point of thinking seriously about Iraq's military and
political position is not that it will tell us whether we can
move against Saddam's army. The more relevant calculation is
when and how we will do so. (Though we would also have to
take some precautions against an Iranian invasion of Kuwait.)</p>
<p>Using our amassed force decisively is not only the proper
military way, but once the necessity of force has been made
clear, it becomes the moral way. It will get the war over and
keep down casualties.</p>
<p>It is of course necessary to consider the troubling factor
that has become a given of politics in the Middle East:
hostages. Up to this point, the Middle East terrorists'
willingness to seize and sacrifice the innocent has greatly
circumscribed the West's ability to respond. Now, however, we
have the spectacle of Saddam Hussein moving civilians to
positions around his military installations as a "human
shield" against attack.</p>
<p>Two important points need to be made about this ultimate
escalation of the hostage strategy. Saddam's threat is the
final evidence that he is nothing more than an international
thug who needs to be removed if there is to be any peace in
the Middle East now or in the foreseeable future. Negotiating
with him, which many in the West surely would support, would
leave his military machine intact. That would leave the Gulf
at his mercy and the world at the mercy of any future pirate
who can lay hands on some Americans.</p>
<p>Indeed, our second point is that the foreigners now at
risk in Kuwait are already victims of the American
preoccupation with hostages in Iran and Lebanon. The
terrorists long ago learned the lesson that with hostages in
hand, the U.S. political culture will reflexively stand
strategy on its head by making any judgments about military
engagement subordinate to the hostage issue. Thus in 1984 the
U.S. sent to Beirut a military force one-tenth of what
President Eisenhower dispatched to Lebanon in 1958. The
Eisenhower intervention (9,000 troops, 70 warships, 400
planes) got its job done cleanly; the Beirut fiasco still
lives in public memory.</p>
<p>Times have changed. Within the space of several weeks,
whatever illusions remained about the nature of Middle
Eastern politics have fallen away. President Bush has
assembled a large U.S. military force in the Persian Gulf,
and it has been joined by supporting forces from the
international community. Saddam Hussein will likely continue
to play the hostage card, the one ploy that has worked for
his kind in the recent past.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the formula now ought to be that we will give
every consideration for the hostages, and for that matter
other noncombatants, consistent with achieving our military
and political purposes.</p>
