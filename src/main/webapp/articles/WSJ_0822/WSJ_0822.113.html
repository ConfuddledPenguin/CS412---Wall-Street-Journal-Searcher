	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices fell sharply as investors
grappled with the uncertainties of the economy and the Middle
East.
   Traders say the selling was heavy by U.S. institutions as
well as some European investors. "The market is seeking its
equilibrium," says Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear
Stearns. That's difficult to do, he adds, with so much doubt
plaguing the market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung broadly, triggering
program-trading circuit breakers twice during the day. The
index ended down 52.48 at 2603.96.</p>
<p>Only two of the 30 stocks in the industrial average posted
gains: Union Carbide ended 3/8 higher to 16 3/8, while
Allied-Signal ended 1/8 higher at 31 1/8.</p>
<p>The broader market also fell, as Standard & Poor's
500-Stock Index lost 6.65 to 321.86, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index dropped 3.48 to 176.94 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index fell 5.98 to 298.02.</p>
<p>Declining stocks swamped gaining issues on the Big Board,
with only 243 stocks rising while 1,441 stocks fell. Trading
was heavy, with volume reaching 194,630,000 shares, up from
Monday's 129,630,000 shares.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange's "uptick" rule went into
effect at 9:49 a.m. EDT after the industrial average dropped
50 points, but was lifted at 12:15 p.m. EDT, when the index
recovered 25 points.</p>
<p>The rule was triggered again at 1:18 p.m. EDT, remaining
in effect for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Under the uptick rule, program trades in the stocks of the
S&P 500 Index can only be executed at prices above or equal
to the previous trade. The rule effectively stops
index-arbitrage program selling in the stock market.</p>
<p>Kenneth P. Ducey, senior vice president of institutional
trading at S.G. Warburg, says he expects the market to find
firmer footing when the industrial average reaches the 2540
level. That's around where the market bottomed after the
minicrash in October 1989 and again in January this year.</p>
<p>But Bear Stearns's Mr. Solomon says that if the Dow Jones
average breaks below the 2540 level, "all of the stock that
was bought in the past year, when the {average} was between
2500 and 3000, will technically be available for sale."</p>
<p>That could lead to a deluge of emotional, stop-loss
selling, Mr. Solomon says.</p>
<p>But not everyone is shunning stocks these days. Mr.
Solomon notes that he has seen an increase in stock buy-backs
by firms who think their stocks are cheap.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns is one. The securities firm bought back 2.4%
of its stock yesterday in a single 2.37 million-share block
from an institutional investor. Bear Stearns paid $10 a
share, a new 52-week low for the stock. The stock closed at
10 1/2, down 1/4, on volume of more than 2.6 million shares.</p>
<p>Fredric E. Russell, a Tulsa, Okla.-based money manager,
says that despite the Mideast conflict, he's advising clients
to continue to buy stock -- but only in those companies that
can survive under the worst economic environments.</p>
<p>Mr. Russell looks for firms that dominate their markets,
are not capital intensive and have little or no debt.</p>
<p>Such companies are likely to weather a recession, and may
even pick up market share as more debt laden firms falter.</p>
<p>He points to stocks like H & R Block, which fell 1 1/8 to
38 3/8; Luby's Cafeterias, which lost 1/4 to 19 3/8; and
Ennis Business Forms, which dropped 1/4 to 18. 60830303 065</p>
<p>Selected energy issues continued to hold fractional gains.</p>
<p>Harken Energy rose 5/8 to 3, despite reporting a loss of
73 cents a share yesterday for its second quarter, down from
profit of 7 cents a share after a gain a year earlier.</p>
<p>BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust rose 1 to 31 3/4, while
Plains Petroleum added 1 to 33 1/2. Oil-service company Baker
Hughes added 3/8 to 32 1/4.</p>
<p>Some defense stocks were higher on the growing threat of
war.</p>
<p>Raytheon added 1 1/8 to 62 1/2, and Loral gained 1 to 29.
E-Systems gained 1 to 27 1/8.</p>
<p>Baltimore Bancorp gained 1 to 9. The bank repeatedly
rejected offers from Al lied Irish Banks and its First
Maryland Bancorp unit earlier this year. Allied Irish most
recently offered $17 a share for the bank. Baltimore Bancorp
said it hasn't been approached by Allied Irish or First
Maryland again.</p>
<p>Casino stocks were among the worst hit groups in the
market. Circus Circus Enter prises fell 2 1/8 to 45 5/8,
while Golden Nugget dropped 2 1/8 to 22 5/8.</p>
<p>Baroid lost 2 1/2 to 11 3/4 after Merrill Lynch made
negative comments about the company and downgraded its rating
on the stock to neutral. On Monday, Baroid's board approved a
plan to split the company in two. The company intends to spin
off its petroleum services business and its metals businesses
into two publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>ROC Taiwan Fund tumbled 1 1/4 to 7 1/2 after a sharp drop
in share prices in Taiwan overnight.</p>
<p>Fluor dropped 2 1/2 to 33 3/8 on volume of more than 1.4
million. Investors may be concerned that Fluor's Saudi
Arabian revenue might suffer from the Mideast conflict. In
June, Fluor won a five-year contract award from Saudi Aramco,
the state-owned Saudi Arabian oil company. The total value of
the contract has not been disclosed. Fluor has said its
business in Saudi Arabia has not been disrupted.</p>
<p>Salomon edged up 1/8 to 22 3/8. Despite the planned
restructuring of its Philipp Brothers unit, the securities
firm said it expects to report a profit for the third
quarter.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 3.95
to 327.34. Volume totaled 19,650,000 shares.</p>
<p>Compumat eased 1/8 to 3 1/8. JWP has agreed to acquire the
company for $3.25 a share. JWP fell 1 1/2 to 19 1/2 in Big
Board trading.</p>
