	<div class="article-body"><p>Conservationists are wading in to try to save the bogs of
Ireland.</p>
<p>Forestation, mechanical cutting of peat turf and drainage
are fast eating away the age-old sanctuaries for plants,
insects and birds. Peter Foss, of the Irish Peatland
Conservation Council, said: "Industrial peat cutting leaves a
vast brown desert. The whole thing is destroyed."</p>
<p>But Bord na Mona, Ireland's state-run turf board, which
sells about four million tons of peat a year, rejects its
critics: "Nobody else works the land of Ireland on a 50-year
time scale like we do and supplies indigenous energy and
employment in remote rural areas." Peat is used as fuel for
homes and electricity generators and to improve garden soil.</p>
<p>Peatlands once covered more than 2.5 million acres, or 17%
of the land surface of Ireland. "Today less than half of the
original peatland area remains in a relatively intact
condition," Mr. Foss said.</p>
<p>Tourist authorities have joined the fight with a brochure
on the boglands that says: "Ireland without her bogs would be
as unimaginable as Germany without its forests or Switzerland
without snow."</p>
<p>LEBANON REFORMS CONSTITUTION</p>
<p>Lebanon's parliament approved constitutional reforms that
give the country's Moslem majority more say in the
Christian-dominated political system, helping to end one of
the main Moslem grievances in the 15-year civil war that has
claimed the lives of more than 130,000 people, wounded a
quarter of a million and devastated much of the country and
its infrastructure. Political sources said the move, although
strongly opposed by Christian rightists, was a breakthrough
in the political stalemate and presented a "real chance to
end the civil war."</p>
<p>BIG LOAN FOR INDONESIA</p>
<p>Japanese trading houses agreed to lend $2.8 billion to
Indonesia's state-run petroleum company for the construction
of an oil refinery at Balongan, central Java. A joint-venture
of six major Japanese trading houses, will obtain the money
for the loan from a group of 21 Japanese banks led by
Industrial Bank of Japan, said Mitsui & Co., which is heading
the joint venture.</p>
<p>`TIGHT' AUSTRALIAN BUDGET</p>
<p>Australian Treasurer Paul Keating presented what he termed
a "tight" federal budget designed to keep Australia on an
even economic keel and enable it to dig out from under its
massive foreign debt. He announced the government would post
a budget surplus of 8.11 billion Australian dollars (US$6.56
billion) for the financial year ending June 30, 1991. The
latest projection follows an A$8.04 billion surplus a year
earlier.</p>
<p>SPIT AND POLISH PATROL</p>
<p>About 76,000 health inspectors are fanning out across
Beijing to enforce higher fines against spitting and
littering and to clean up the Chinese capital before next
month's Asian Games. In one five-hour span near the city's
main railway station, 230 people were fined, the China Daily
said. Beijing is undergoing a frenzied facelift, repaving
roads, painting fading facades and even hiding urban blight
behind newly built walls. The games are expected to attract
athletes from more than 30 countries.</p>
<p>SOUTH KOREAN ARMS ORDERS</p>
<p>South Korean manufacturers have been flooded with orders
from Middle East nations for combat boots, uniforms and other
military supplies, an official said. South Korean newspapers
have reported that the U.S. has pressured South Korea to
furnish military supplies to Saudi Arabia and other countries
who are committed to an alliance against Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S.-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS</p>
<p>Two U.S. legislators said Vietnam's economic improvements
and its willingness to hold direct talks with Washington
justify U.S. efforts to normalize relations between the
countries.</p>
<p>Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) and Rep. David Dreier (R.,
Calif.), who met Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi last weekend,
told a news conference in Hong Kong that a recent U.S. policy
shift had offered a new impetus to talks between high-ranking
U.S. and Vietnamese officials.</p>
<p>In July, the U.S. withdrew recognition of the Khmer
Rouge-dominated opponents to Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed
government.</p>
<p>Sen. Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee and one of the highest-ranking U.S. legislators to
visit Vietnam since 1975, said he and Rep. Dreier, a member
of the House Banking and Small Business committees, would
tell Washington "that Vietnam has made considerable progress
in moving toward a market economy, that there are clearly
opportunities there for American businessmen, and that the
U.S. should carefully consider whether this is an opportunity
to progress (toward closer economic ties)."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Sony Corp. said it plans to send a team of senior managers
to Eastern Europe to teach management skills to corporate
executives. The team, from Sony's financial, personnel
management and research and development divisions, will hold
seminars in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and
Bulgaria starting in late October. . . . Laos and China have
begun talks in Vientiane on delineating their 285-mile common
border, the official Laotian radio reported.</p>
