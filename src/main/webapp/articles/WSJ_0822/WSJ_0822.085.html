	<p class="article-leader">CYPRESS, Calif. -- PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. said it
may purchase on the open market as many as 500,000 shares, or
about 4%, of its 11.5 million common shares outstanding.
   "With the recent significant decline in the market . . .
and PacifiCare's stock price in particular, there may be
attractive opportunities . . . to acquire shares," said Terry
Hartshorn, president and chief executive officer of the
health maintenance organization. The purchases will be made
when market and business conditions are favorable, he said.</p>
