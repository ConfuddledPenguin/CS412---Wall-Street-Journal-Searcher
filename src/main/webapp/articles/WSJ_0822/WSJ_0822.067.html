	<p class="article-leader">The New Jersey Casino Control Commission unanimously
approved Donald J. Trump's $65 million bank bailout, though
the commission chairman cautioned that the plan wouldn't
resolve all of the developer's financial troubles.
   The approval caps three months of arduous negotiations
that led to the agreement that restructured about $2 billion
of Mr. Trump's $3.2 billion of casino and bank debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to lending him $65 million, the banks will
suspend about $850 million in interest payments for the next
three to five years. In return, Mr. Trump gave the banks
second mortgages on almost all his assets, including his
three Atlantic City casinos. He also agreed to stringent
financial controls, including limits on his personal
spending.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Mr. Trump reached an agreement with a
group of subcontractors that is owed about $70 million for
its work on Mr. Trump's Taj Mahal casino. Persons close to
the negotiations said the contractors accepted 20%, or about
$14 million, now with the rest of the payments deferred over
five years.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's next step is expected to be a restructuring of
the remaining $1.2 billion in casino debt. As part of its
approval, the commission set a relicensing hearing within
three weeks to evaluate the financial stability of Mr.
Trump's three casinos.</p>
<p>"I do not view this restructuring as the total solution to
the problem," Valerie Armstrong, the acting commission
chairwoman, said.</p>
<p>In preparation for Mr. Trump's bond restructuring
proposal, Taj Mahal bondholders yesterday retained Rothschild
Inc. as their investment adviser.</p>
<p>Because they hold first-mortgage bonds, the Taj
bondholders believe they are in a stronger position than Mr.
Trump.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, we think Mr. Trump is a pragmatist
and at the end of the day the banks are pragmatic too," said
Wilbur Ross, a debt restructuring specialist with Rothschild.
In the past, Mr. Trump has said that if the Taj is forced to
file for bankruptcy-court protection, bondholders won't
receive interest or equity for three years.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said he was happy with the commission's
decision. "It was a wonderful victory. I'm very happy with
the decision," he said.</p>
<p>Essentially, Mr. Trump's advisers said, the commission's
approval is a sign it believes many of the developer's
problems may be solved if he is given breathing room.</p>
<p>"After balancing the issues, the commission felt it was
better for the bank deal to go forward and give Mr. Trump the
opportunity to deal with his Atlantic City situation," said
Nicholas Ribis, Mr. Trump's New Jersey attorney who argued
Mr. Trump's case before the commission.</p>
<p>Many of the bankers and lawyers involved said the bailout
was one of the most complex corporate restructurings they
ever worked on. Close to 90 lending institutions were party
to the bailout, and about 1,000 lawyers, bankers and
accountants participated in the talks. Over the past week,
Mr. Trump spent much of his time in the Manhattan law offices
of Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, where he personally signed
close to 2,000 documents.</p>
<p>Wachtell represents Bankers Trust Corp. which, in addition
to being one of Mr. Trump's most exposed creditors, is acting
as agent for the other banks.</p>
<p>Wachtell is also one of about a dozen law firms which have
run up a total of about $10 million in legal fees, according
to persons involved in the negotiations. In a debt
restructuring, legal fees are traditionally paid for by the
debtor, although recently released financial documents show
Mr. Trump may not have the funds to pay the banks' lawyers.</p>
<p>The banks attorneys are believed to be working on a
payment schedule that mirrors somewhat the arrangement
reached last night with Mr. Trump's unpaid subcontractors.</p>
<p>According to persons familiar with the arrangement, Mr.
Trump will give the bank attorneys one-third of their fees
now, another third in April and the remainder in June. Should
Mr. Trump not be able to pay the fees, the attorneys will
still most likely be paid by the banks, said a person
familiar with the negotiations.</p>
