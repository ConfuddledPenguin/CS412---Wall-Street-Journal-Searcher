	<p class="article-leader">NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- First American Corp. said it plans to
reduce its 3,800-employee work force by 8% to 10%, by the end
of next year.
   Struggling with problem loans and falling earnings in
recent quarters, the bank said that a significant portion of
the reduction would be acheived through normal employee
turnover. A spokeswoman said some jobs would be eliminated,
but said she couldn't say how many.</p>
