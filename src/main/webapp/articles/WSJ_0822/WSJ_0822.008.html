	<p class="article-leader">BEDFORD HEIGHTS, Ohio -- Waxman Industries Inc. expects to
report that fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell 36% to $1.4
million, or 14 cents a share, largely as a result of higher
interest expenses, said Armond Waxman, president and co-chief
executive.
   However, operating profit for the quarter ended June 30
rose to $9 million from $7.8 million. In the year-earlier
period, the wholesaler of plumbing, electrical and hardware
products for the do-it-yourself home repair market had net
income of $2.2 million, or 24 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $111 million from $94.6
million, following the May 1989 acquisition of Ideal Group of
Cos., a Canadian company that now accounts for 55% of Waxman
sales. The acquisition also boosted the company's interest
expense to $6.7 million from $4.6 million last year.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter results were also hurt by Canada's 14 3/4
prime rate -- the highest since 1972. Moreover, about 10,000
members of the construction trade were on strike in Ontario,
one of Waxman's major profit centers, for two months during
the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"The strike came at a very bad time for us," Waxman said
in an interview. "That, coupled with the high interest rates,
really slowed down renovation, remodeling and construction."
He said he's optimistic interest rates will go down,
following a recent half-point drop in the prime.</p>
<p>In the current fiscal year, Waxman said the company will
concentrate on reducing debt, and consolidating operations.
He said he expects to retire about 10% of the existing $220
million in debt.</p>
<p>One debt-reduction approach will be to sell and lease back
about 12 facilities in Canada to generate cash to retire
debt. In the U.S., Waxman will concentrate on tightening
inventories and receivables, reducing working capital and
consolidating warehouse operations.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is to pay down debt and be more efficient in
operations by doing more rationalization of our business,"
Waxman said.</p>
