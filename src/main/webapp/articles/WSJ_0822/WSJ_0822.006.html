	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In a political victory for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing, a law putting captioned television in reach
of far more Americans is nearing reality.
   The Senate last month passed the Television Decoder
Circuitry Act, which would require that all TV sets sold
after July 1, 1993, be equipped with a built-in chip allowing
the sets to be activated to decode and display closed
captioning.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though some economists and industry experts question the
need to have all televisions equipped with the chips, House
approval is expected after Congress's August recess.</p>
<p>The chip also represents a technological advance.
Currently, a small decoder box similar to a TV cable-system
box is necessary to decode the captioning signal, which
accompanies 400 hours of cable-system programming a week, at
the most.</p>
<p>With decoding capability, words appear on the bottom of
the television screen, letting viewers read the narrative or
dialogue as they watch the pictures.</p>
<p>Although more than 15 million Americans have some degree
of hearing loss, only about 300,000 of the decoding boxes are
currently in use, according to the National Captioning
Institute in Leesburg, Va. Advocates for the deaf say the
cost of the decoders -- each sells for about $160 or more --
and the stigma of using them have held down purchases.</p>
<p>So has a lack of full captioning programming, especially
for breaking news stories. Last October, when ABC-TV already
had its equipment in San Francisco to cover the World Series,
its coverage of the Bay Area earthquake also provided the
first simultaneous or "real-time" captioned coverage of a
breaking news event that many hard-of-hearing Americans had
ever experienced.</p>
<p>"It was the first time in 25 years that I had watched an
emergency situation unfold on TV and be able to understand
what was happening," says King Jordan, the deaf president of
Gallaudet University here, the nation's only university for
the deaf.</p>
<p>Requiring that the captioning capability be built right
into the TV set is expected to widen the demand for
closed-captioning. "Those people who might never have bought
a decoder are more likely to give it a shot now," says Larry
Goldberg, director of the Caption Center of WGBH public TV in
Boston.</p>
<p>"Because the sheer number of users will increase the
number of hours and programs that are closed-captioned, it'll
make sense both cost-wise and program-wise," adds Dr. Roslyn
Rosen, president of the National Association of the Deaf in
Silver Spring, Md. "Many hearing non-English speaking people
will also come to depend on captioning as a means for
acquiring English skills," she says.</p>
<p>Even though the chips won't be required until 1993, some
companies are pushing to get such TV sets on the market
before then. One of them is Zenith Electronics Corp.,
Glenview, Ill., the only remaining independent U.S.
manufacturer of television sets. "There is a whole new market
out there," says Bruce Huber, Zenith's vice president of
marketing. Zenith hopes to reach that market first.</p>
<p>Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., a subsidiary of
French-based Thomson S.A., says it is working on its own
version of the decoder chip. A unit of Sanyo Electric Co.,
which also is reported to be working on its version of the
chip, declined to answer inquiries.</p>
<p>Specifications for the chip proved a sticking point in the
original legislative draft. The industry claimed that the
language would virtually mandate purchase of a chip that the
National Captioning Institute paid ITT Corp. $1 million to
develop. The institute, a nonprofit organization, hopes to
recoup its investment through a 5% royalty from the sale of
each ITT chip to TV manufacturers. The bill was revised to
let companies buy their chips from anyone or develop them on
their own.</p>
<p>The legislation seems headed for sure approval, partly
because interest groups are putting legislators under more
pressure to answer the needs of those with physical
impairments, as reflected in recent passage of the
far-reaching Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>An official of the Electronic Industries Association, a
Washington-based trade group, angered some senators on the
subcommittee responsible for the decoder bill when he
complained that the new chip would hurt poor TV buyers by
making sets more costly; estimates of price-tag rises range
from $5 to $25. The senators criticized the industry for
putting profits before concerns about access for the
handicapped.</p>
<p>After negotiating to delay the date for requiring the
chip, the EIA signed on to the legislation.</p>
<p>Some economists question the idea of including the chip in
every TV set, regardless of whether the buyer wants access to
captioning. Kenneth Flam, an economist at the Brookings
Institution, says the current legislation imposes a hidden
tax on both the consumer and the producer. "It doesn't look
like a tax, but it is nonetheless -- people are paying. The
goal is laudable, but perhaps it's not the most efficient
mechanism."</p>
<p>Mr. Flam says it would be more efficient to place a small
surcharge on every TV set, with the proceeds going toward
purchases of the external decoding box. Another option would
be for the federal government to subsidize the purchase of
the box decoders. But advocates of the legislation argue that
without the economies of scale derived by mass-producing the
chip, the costs would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>Marketing analysts are unsure about what impact the
chip-equipped TV sets will have on sales. Consumers are very
cost-conscious when choosing a TV set, says Julian Menear,
senior vice president of Young Capital Group of Chicago, but
the higher production costs could be offset by increased
demand. "There are many different markets and uses for
televisions with subtitles -- translation, maybe a ticker,
maybe advertising," he says.</p>
<p>Adds Gallaudet's Mr. Jordan, "TV is a sound-based medium
with nice visuals to make it pleasant. Captioning gives us
access to the information."</p>
