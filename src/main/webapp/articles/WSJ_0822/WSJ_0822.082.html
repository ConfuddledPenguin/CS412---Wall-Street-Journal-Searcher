	<p class="article-leader">NVR Limited Partnership posted a $53.3 million, or
$1.90-a-share, second-quarter loss, due mostly to the
restructuring program the company began in recent months.
   The McLean, Va., company also said that it wouldn't make a
second-quarter distribution to unit holders and it wasn't
certain whether it would be able to make interest payments on
its subordinated debt securities due later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year earlier, the company earned $9 million, or 34 cents
a share.</p>
<p>The residential homebuilder and land developer said that
restructuring provisions totaled $58.5 million. The company
attributed about $12.2 million of the restructuring charges
to costs it will incur to carry out its previously announced
plans to phase out home building operations from its Florida
and Midwestern markets. About $46.3 million is related to the
company's write-down of certain land and real estate
partnership interests to reflect more accurately their
current market value.</p>
<p>NVR has been hurt by the slump in the real estate market
and the drop in demand for new housing. In documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission Monday, the
company said that as part of its restructuring, it will
re-evaluate all of its markets and businesses. The company
said "additional losses are likely" but said it couldn't
estimate them at this time.</p>
<p>NVR expects that its banks will extend the company's
working capital line of credit through Feb. 15. It's
currently in place through next Wednesday. A $50 million
mortgage warehouse credit line previously was extended
through Dec. 31.</p>
<p>NVR cited its second-quarter loss and certain bank
restrictions as the reason for omitting its second-quarter
distribution. In the first quarter, it had paid unit holders
one cent per unit, after distributing 67 cents per unit last
year.</p>
<p>The company said its board will meet after year end to
review taxable income and determine how much, if any,
distribution would be appropriate for 1990.</p>
<p>The company said that its senior subordinated note holders
were previously notified by the indenture trustee of a
covenant default. NVR expects that the trustee will notify
the bondholders of another covenant default arising from the
previously announced nonpayment of certain debts by its
limited recourse land development subsidiary, NVR
Development, which is in the process of restructuring its
debt.</p>
<p>NVR closed yesterday at 93.75 cents, off 6.25 cents, in
American Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
