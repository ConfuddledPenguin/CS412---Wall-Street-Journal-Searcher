	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Trump Princess is definitely not invited
to this regatta. But there is sure to be a vessel in the
tradition of the good ship "Warthog."
   It's Manhattan's Instant Boat Contest, commonly known by
participants as "Glue It, Screw It and Row It." The contest
is to take place this Saturday and Sunday at Pier 26 on the
Hudson River.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The idea is to build a boat in a day using three sheets of
plywood, four two-by-fours, three pounds of nails and lots of
black glue made by Sika Corp., which originally sponsored the
race to promote its adhesive. Builders must bring their own
specified list of tools.</p>
<p>Todd Greeno, a former Navy figher pilot, and Don
O'Donoghue, a bartender, built an eight-foot replica of the
aircraft carrier USS Enterprise last year. It came complete
with a flight deck and a battery-powered toy F-4 Phantom
figher jet that circled the carrier as it was launched.</p>
<p>"We designed it on the back of a bar napkin," Mr. Greeno
said of the carrier, which won first prize for best creative
design but finished eighth in the sea trials. "This year's
boat is going to be more streamlined."</p>
<p>The new sponsors of the contest are two nonprofit groups,
the River Project, an oceanographic research organization,
and B.O.A.T.S. (Boat Owners Association to Survive). The
idea, the groups say, is to promote boating on the Hudson
River and demonstrate that you don't have to be a millionaire
to go boating.</p>
<p>The rules are simple: Contestants must build a boat in one
day. On the next day, they must row or paddle it -- along
shore -- from one pier to another and back, a distance of
about 2,000 feet.</p>
<p>Steven Tiebout, a retired magazine writer, won for being
the fastest boat builder last year. (The category has been
eliminated.) His vessel was the aptly named Warthog. "I
wanted to build a boat that would take the least amount of
time, so I knew it wasn't going to be good looking," he says.</p>
<p>Of course, the boats don't always log much time on the
water once the race is run. One entry has been converted into
a flower planter, says Cathy Drew, director of the River
Project. Another became a wading pool.</p>
<p>Judging will be based on creativity of design,
functionality and results of the sea trials. But, sponsors
warn, the judges' decision "should be expected to be
arbitrary and capricious."</p>
