	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields were unchanged on small-denomination
certificates of deposit sold directly by major banks, but
continued to rise on large deposits and broker-sold CDs.
   On a small-denomination one-year CD, for instance, the
average yield remained at 7.52% in the week ended yesterday,
according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service
based here. The average yield on small six-month CDs slipped
to 7.37% from 7.38%, Banxquote said. Oneyear and six-month
CDs are considered the most popular among individual
investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yields on some CDs sold by major brokerage firms, however,
increased about a tenth of a percentage point, as did yields
on large-denomination, "jumbo" CDs sold directly by banks.
The average yield on a one-year broker-sold CD rose to 7.99%
from 7.89%. On a one-year jumbo CD, generally more than
$90,000, the average yield increased to 7.73% from 7.63%.</p>
<p>Broker-sold CDs and jumbos tend to respond quickly to
interest-rate changes because of competition for
institutional money. The crisis in the Middle East, along
with a weaker dollar and higher interest rates abroad, are
pushing up U.S. rates, said Norberto Mehl, chairman of
Banxquote.</p>
<p>Yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction rose to
7.80% from 7.66% for three-month bills, and to 7.85% from
7.70% for six-month bills.</p>
<p>A few of the 18 banks surveyed by Banxquote offer yields
higher than 8% on small deposits for two and five-year
maturities. The highest average yield in the latest Banxquote
survey was 8.53% on five-year CDs sold by broker-dealers.</p>
