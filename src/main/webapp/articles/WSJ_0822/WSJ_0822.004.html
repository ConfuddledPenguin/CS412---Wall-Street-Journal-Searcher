	<p class="article-leader">AN AIR FORCE BASE, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi and Iraqi pilots
are probing each other's defenses, coming within fighting
range of each other near the Kuwaiti border.
   Brig. Gen. Turki bin Nasser, commander of a large Royal
Saudi Air Force base (which cannot be named under press
censorship rules here) calls it a game of electronic "cat and
mouse that goes on almost every day."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We see them. We lock on them and they turn around and
go," he told a group of reporters. "Locking on," in pilots'
jargon, is the first step in preparing radar-guided missiles
to fire at an enemy plane.</p>
<p>Gen. Nasser's remarks came during a tour of this base,
where reporters saw chemical-weapons detectors positioned in
doorways and U.S.-built F-15 fighters in massive, bunker-like
hangars built to withstand bombings and chemical-weapons
attacks.</p>
<p>As an unprecedented armada of U.S. forces continues to
arrive here, tension in the Saudi government is palpable. A
Saudi civilian official said the government has begun buying
gas masks and other gear to protect people who live in the
Eastern Province near major oil fields from a
chemical-weapons attack. "We are basically preparing for the
worst possibilities," he said.</p>
<p>Gen. Nasser said that one result of the Persian Gulf
crisis will be a permanent enlargement of the Saudi military.
While some officials are talking about a draft, Gen. Nasser
said he felt the enlargement could be carried out with
volunteers. "We don't really need to go to a draft. If we
call, they will come."</p>
<p>King Fahd, the ruler of this desert kingdom, already has
called for the opening of recruitment centers for volunteers
who want to join the Saudi armed forces.</p>
<p>Unofficial estimates of the cost of the crisis to the
Saudi government range as high as $9 billion to $11 billion,
counting extra costs of weaponry, logistics support, housing
for some 100,000 Kuwaiti refugees being put up in hotels at
government expense, and the projected effect on the Saudi
economy over the next three months.</p>
<p>Prince Abdullah A. al-Assaf, a pipe-smoking engineer who
heads the government-owned Saudi Petrochemical Co., said he
had no precise estimates. "Nobody sat down to figure out how
much this is costing," he said, explaining that the kingdom
is prepared to do what needs to be done to protect its people
and the large expatriate community here.</p>
<p>"This has hurt the whole world. Our economy has been hurt
tremendously also," he said. The prince, who oversees the
development of Yanbu and Jubail, two new industrial port
cities, worries that foreign businessmen who had agreed to
undertake joint ventures there with the Saudis may pull out
if the country seems unsafe.</p>
<p>Recently, the prince said, he had scheduled 12 meetings to
discuss joint ventures and 10 of them were canceled.</p>
<p>He and other Saudi officials say Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein is forcing the kingdom to refocus its spending on
defense. Saddam Hussein, they assert, spent as much as $120
billion over the last 10 years on his military, while the
Saudi government has spent much of its oil wealth on social
programs and non-military development.</p>
<p>Another "cost" to the Saudi government has been an
invasion of the kingdom by a multinational force of more than
200 reporters, photographers and television crewmen. The
media circus is new to the privacy-loving Saudis, who have
refused to allow foreign news organizations to have a
permanent base here.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, Saudi officials said they were considering
revoking many of the visas they have issued to reporters
during the crisis and were discussing the resumption of a
much smaller pool of news organizations that would operate
under tight rules imposed by the Pentagon.</p>
