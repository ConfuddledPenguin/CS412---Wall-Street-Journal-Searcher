	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc., amid a new flurry of
magazine introductions, said it will publish a spinoff of
Sports Illustrated, to be called Sports Illustrated Classic
and focus on sports nostalgia.
   The magazine is scheduled to be published three times in
1991, beginning with an issue in March. It will be delivered
to Sports Illustrated subscribers and distributed on
newsstands nationwide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sports Illustrated Classic is the latest example of Time
Warner's attempt to build new magazines based on existing
titles, rather than starting from scratch. But even as Time
Warner is extending the Sports Illustrated name, it's unclear
how successful the company has been with similar attempts
recently. Last year, Time launched Sports Illustrated for
Kids, which has built a circulation of 850,000, but it won't
be profitable until 1992, company executives said. Also in
development are Fortune for Students and Time for Kids.</p>
<p>Donald J. Barr, publisher of Sports Illustrated, said the
sports nostalgia concept tested well among readers. "It's one
of the areas of highest reader satisfaction," he said.</p>
<p>In a new twist for a Time Warner magazine, advertising in
each issue of Sports Illustrated Classic will be limited to
40 pages. Advertisers also will be offered category
exclusivity if they purchase four pages in each of the 1991
issues. For example, if a toothpaste maker signs up,
competitors won't be able to buy space.</p>
<p>The magazine joins other new launches at Time Warner.
Despite a rough start for the magazine Entertainment Weekly,
Time Warner said last week it also would try a new woman's
magazine in November with how-to book author Martha Stewart,
to be called Martha Stewart Living.</p>
