	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Securities and commodities regulators filed
charges against Stotler & Co., adding to the troubles of the
closed futures brokerage firm and its part-owner, former
Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann.
   In administrative proceedings, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
charged the firm with failing to maintain sufficient capital
since December. In addition, the CFTC charged Stotler with
overstating the amount of capital held by the firm. The SEC
also said the firm failed to file documents and kept outdated
and improper records of capital levels and of positions in
the government-securities markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The firm, which last month closed its doors because of a
lack of capital, settled the CFTC charges, agreeing to have
its license revoked and promising the agency it would
cooperate with a continuing CFTC investigation, the
commodities regulator said. But Stotler didn't settle the SEC
charges, and the case is scheduled to be heard by an SEC
administrative law judge. The SEC also regulates the
commodities broker because the firm trades government bonds.
Stotler officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>CFTC enforcement director Dennis Klejna said the agencies
knew of each other's charges, and that "as far as we're
concerned this is an ongoing investigation." William Hegan,
the SEC's deputy regional administrator in Chicago, said that
the agency "regards net capital as a serious violation. It
goes to the heart of the business."</p>
<p>The charges are the latest in a series of setbacks for Mr.
Mahlmann, Stotler and its parent Stotler Group Inc. Mr.
Mahlmann, who has said that he hasn't been involved in the
firms' daily operations, hasn't been charged with any
wrongdoing by either regulatory agency. But he recently
resigned as head of the CBOT in the wake of charges against
commodity pool operations run by a Stotler unit.</p>
<p>In those charges, the CFTC said the pool operator, Stotler
Funds, violated anti-fraud laws by effectively making $5.5
million in loans from two pools to parent Stotler Group. That
money represented customer funds that investors were told
would be invested in commodities, the CFTC said. Mr. Mahlmann
recently resigned as a director of Stotler Funds and chairman
of Stotler Group.</p>
<p>Early this month, Stotler Group was forced into
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by the commodity funds it
managed, which said that the group owed them more than $5
million.</p>
<p>More disciplinary steps against Stotler Group, its units
and possibly its officers are expected in the next few months
as details become known surrounding the collapse of what had
been one of the country's biggest futures brokerage firms.
Futures regulators have said they may also refer certain
aspects of Stotler Group's collapse to the U.S. attorney for
possible criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann, 52 years old, has asserted that he knew
nothing of the loans made by the funds and hasn't been
involved in the day-to-day management of Stotler Group for
two years. But he became the first CBOT chairman in 130 years
to resign from the nation's largest futures exchange.</p>
