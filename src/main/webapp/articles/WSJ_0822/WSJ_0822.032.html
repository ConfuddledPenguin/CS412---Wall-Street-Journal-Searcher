	<p class="article-leader">National Semiconductor Corp., in an effort to reverse
years of poor performance, said it will eliminate several
product groups, lay off 6.2% of its employees and incur a
$140 million charge.
   As part of the cutbacks, National will close two assembly
lines and reorganize its product groups. National's move is
an attempt to reduce its dependence on so-called "commodity"
chips -- standard semiconductors that have come under
competitive pressure from other companies that make them --
and to focus on developing more specialized chips that offer
higher profit margins.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Commodity-chip makers such as National and Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. have been battered by low-priced chips from
Japanese and other makers, while companies such as Intel
Corp. enjoy fat profits from more specialized chips.</p>
<p>"National Semi is the stereotypical commodity company"
that hasn't adapted to changes in the chip market, said
analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They're
now making concessions they probably should have made five
years ago."</p>
<p>The Santa Clara, Calif., company said it will stop making
high-density versions of chips called static random-access
memories, or SRAMs. National will shut down a brand-new line
in its Puyallup, Wash., factory that it set up just this year
to make SRAM chips that can hold more than a million pieces,
or one megabit, of computer information.</p>
<p>Over the next 18 months, National said, it also will shut
down a Tucson, Ariz., plant that assembles chips for the
military, which are suffering from lower demand because of
Pentagon budget cutbacks. And the company will slow
production of chips called CMOS gate arrays. The high-density
SRAM market hasn't developed as well as expected and profit
margins in the gate arrays are too low, said Charles E.
Sporck, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>National also said it will reorganize its six product
divisions into four. As part of the closures and
reorganization, National said it will fire about 2,000
employees world-wide over the next few months and will incur
a one-time charge of about $140 million in the quarter ending
Aug. 26.</p>
<p>The cutbacks come after a year of trimming and a string of
disastrous quarters. The company laid off 2,000 employees in
January 1989 and later closed plants in South Korea and
Singapore, taking charges of about $54 million in the year
for the cutbacks.</p>
<p>The company had a net loss in five of its past eight
quarters. Although it eked out net income of $4.7 million in
its last quarter, the chip maker is expected to incur a large
net loss in its current quarter because of the one-time
charge. And National expects operating profit for the quarter
to be below analysts' expectations. Analysts had expected the
company to break even on operating profit.</p>
<p>National's stock, which has fallen about 38% since early
June, closed at $5 a share, up 12.5 cents, in composite
trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
