	<p class="article-leader">Abrams Industries Inc. expects to report a loss of
$250,000 to $300,000 in the first quarter ended July 31, said
Bernard W. Abrams, chairman and chief executive officer.
   The loss will amount to eight cents to 10 cents a share. A
year ago, the company had net income of $192,320, or six
cents a share. Sales are expected to range from $16.5 million
to $17.5 million, up from $12.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Atlanta construction, manufacturing and real estate
concern blamed the loss squarely on lower shipments of store
fixtures. Mr. Abrams said that certain shipments the company
had expected to make in the quarter were delayed and will be
"moved back further" in the year.</p>
<p>Mr. Abrams stressed, though, that the construction and
real estate businesses were profitable. "We expect all
segments to be profitable in the second quarter {ending Oct.
31}," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Abrams conceded that the biggest business --
construction -- has considerable exposure to increasing oil
prices, but said he believes the company is better poised to
handle the effects than it was in the mid-1970s. Contracts
have shorter terms now, typically about six months, which
allow Abrams to make more timely energy-cost estimates when
preparing contracts.</p>
