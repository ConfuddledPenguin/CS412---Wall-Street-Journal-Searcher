	<p class="article-leader">Hoesch AG of West Germany, a diversified steel company,
said its first-half pretax profit rose 3.2% to 355 million
marks ($226.7 million) from 344 million marks a year earlier.
   Sales slipped 1% to 5.33 billion marks from 5.39 billion
marks. Sales in the manufacturing and industry technology
division rose 4.1% to 2.73 billion marks, and in its
automation sector climbed 22% to 256 million marks. But sales
in its steel division fell 1.7% to 1.95 billion marks, and in
trading and services declined 9% to 1.89 billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hoesch said that a slowdown in steel sales in several
countries, particularly the Soviet Union and China, led to
the decline in sales, but that this was partly made up by a
decline in raw materials prices in mark terms, owing to the
weaker dollar.</p>
<p>For the full year, Hoesch said, it expects earnings to
reach the level for 1989, when profit climbed 31% to 76
million marks on a 28% rise in sales to 10.68 billion marks.</p>
