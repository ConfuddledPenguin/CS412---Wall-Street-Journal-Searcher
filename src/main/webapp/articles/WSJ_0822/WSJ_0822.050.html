	<p class="article-leader">NUWEIBA, Egypt -- Thousands of Egyptian migrant workers
fleeing Kuwait struggled off overcrowded ferries at this port
on the Gulf of Aqaba, bringing a few possessions and tales of
what they left behind.
   In the 105-degree heat, the Egyptian refugees, some of
whom have been trying to reach their homeland for more than a
week, give accounts of pillaging and brutality by Iraqi
soldiers in Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Waddih Nagib said he tried to leave three times before
making it to the Jordanian port of Aqaba, 40 miles northeast
of Nuweiba at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba where the
borders of Egypt, Israel and Jordan meet. He came with his
two brothers and two friends, all in the front seat of a tiny
truck.</p>
<p>In his first attempt a week ago, he and four Americans
were turned back in the desert by Iraqi soldiers. Mr. Nagib
said the soldiers took away the Americans.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of shooting, but I don't know what
happened to them," he said.</p>
<p>The desert, according to Mr. Nagib and others, was studded
with land mines. He and his companions said they saw rockets
and missiles being deployed along the Persian Gulf in Kuwait
by Iraqi troops. The editor of Jane's Soviet Intelligence
Review in London said yesterday that Iraq has moved 36
missile launchers and 800 Soviet-built or Iraqi-modified
ballistic missiles into Kuwait.</p>
<p>Mr. Nagib said Iraqi soldiers "robbed us of everything we
had -- our money, a television set, a radio and a vacuum
cleaner." He added, "We hate them. They have attacked
everyone and robbed everyone."</p>
<p>Mahmoud Alweh, an Egyptian teller in Kuwait City's
International Bank, left a week ago with his wife and two
small sons in a Chevrolet.</p>
<p>"We lost everything," he said. "Our house, our money, 12
years' worth of savings. You could lose your mind."</p>
<p>On the morning after Iraq's Aug. 2 raid on Kuwait City,
Mr. Alweh said he went to the supermarket for provisions: "It
was incredibly crowded. People were buying everything they
could get their hands on, whether they needed it or not."</p>
<p>When he got back to his house, he said, soldiers filled
his street. "By nightime bombs were falling and there was
shooting all night. My son was shaking. In the morning, the
streets were filled with blood and bloody clothes, shoes,
shirts and soldiers' caps."</p>
<p>The streets in Kuwait City were littered with "thousands"
of cars, Mr. Alweh said, many of which had burned. Many cars
were "just stolen," said Mr. Alweh.</p>
<p>The banker's wife said "they raped many." She said
soldiers also stole jewelry. Mr. Alweh said soldiers robbed
jewelry stores and electrical appliance stores.</p>
<p>"Where will I go now?" asked Mr. Alweh. "Anywhere would be
better. We have been driving eight days. We have been hungry
and thirsty."</p>
<p>Mohammed Hussein, an Egyptian air-conditioner salesman who
left with his brother and two small daughters, said Kuwaiti
soldiers and civilians offered scattered resistance. He said
one Kuwaiti loaded his car with explosives and charged a
hospital near the town of Shouera where Iraq's military had
set up a command post.</p>
<p>Drinking water and orange soda at the Ali Baba restaurant
here, Mr. Hussein complained of crowds and delays in Aqaba.
He said he waited four days there before being able to catch
a ferry to Egypt. Egyptian officials say 5,000 to 8,000
people are traveling from Aqaba to Nuweiba each day. They say
as many as 20,000 Egyptians and 800 Sudanese are waiting in
Aqaba. The Egyptian consulate provided free food to the
refugees.</p>
<p>Jordanian officials have asked Iraq to try to slow the
flow of refugees. A senior Israeli official said Jordan also
asked Israel to open its border to refugees so they could
travel to Egypt. Diplomatic sources in Washington told the
Associated Press that Israel has offered to facilitate the
return home of Egyptian civilians.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein said refugees in Aqaba found their Kuwaiti
currency almost worthless. "The Jordanians wouldn't take our
money," he said. He also reported long lines at gasoline
stations.</p>
