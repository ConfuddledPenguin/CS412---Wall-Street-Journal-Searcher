	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The NBC television network is cutting annual
payments to its 200-plus affiliated stations by 10%, or about
$15 million, blaming the cutback on declining ratings.
   The severity of the reduction in so-called affiliate
compensation was unexpected, given the past five years of
prime-time dominance by National Broadcasting Co., a General
Electric Co. unit and the most profitable network by far. "We
expected a reduction of about 5%," said Eric Bremner,
president of the NBC affiliate board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cuts are to begin in January 1991 and are a result of
the network's continuing shortfall in delivering the key
demographic group of viewers ages 18 to 49, a primary target
for advertisers. Moreover, some broadcast executives predict
the cuts could be increased if NBC's ratings decline further
when the new television season starts in mid-September.</p>
<p>NBC has said it faces a $200 million shortfall in
projected ad revenue because of declining ratings this year.
In March, NBC added about 14 30-second commercials in prime
time to compensate advertisers for failing to deliver as many
viewers as the network had guaranteed.</p>
<p>NBC pays about $146 million annually to its affiliated
stations in return for their airing network shows and
providing NBC with a national audience that can be sold to
advertisers. The compensation system dates back more than 50
years and began with radio.</p>
<p>Compensation has been a key element -- and in recent years
a major point of dissension -- in the network-affiliate
relationship. For instance, when a local station contemplates
switching network affiliation, the threatened network will
generally increase the compensation payment as incentive to
forgo the switch.</p>
<p>Some NBC affiliates will see decreases of 15%. NBC
wouldn't elaborate.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Bremner of the affiliate board, NBC
wanted to eliminate compensation entirely about two years
ago. But NBC met resistance from the affiliates and later
devised a formula to determine the amount of compensation to
be paid. The amount of compensation was to be based on the
average for the network's ratings performance during
February, May and November.</p>
<p>NBC's ratings declined 3% in November, dropped 2% in
February -- and plunged a surprising 25% in May. "The network
admitted it screwed up" by airing too many repeats of
prime-time shows, Mr. Bremner said. The overall decline in
NBC's prime-time ratings for the three months came to 10%,
and so affiliates' compensation will fall by a like amount.</p>
<p>"Compensation is still a vital part of the
network-affiliate partnership," said John Damiano, NBC's
senior vice president of affiliate relations, who confirmed
the plan to roll back affiliate payments, "and we see it as
an investment."</p>
<p>Mr. Damiano said compensation had increased annually until
1989 and that "some stations could actually be in for an
increase, although they'll be the exception."</p>
<p>To make up for lost revenue from NBC, some affiliates
might forgo airing some NBC programs in favor of syndicated
shows that let the stations keep more of the advertising
revenue instead of having to share spots with NBC. For
example, KYW, the NBC affiliate in Philadelphia, won't
broadcast "Hull Street High," a new NBC series airing Sundays
at 7 p.m., and will instead air syndicated repeats of "21
Jump Street."</p>
<p>"Pre-emptions are a danger here," said Mr. Bremner, "and I
regret it. It hurts the whole network-affiliate
relationship."</p>
<p>Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s television network, now No. 2
and gaining on NBC in prime time, particularly among young
adults, isn't planning to reduce or change its compensation
payments.</p>
<p>Nor is CBS Inc.'s network, in third place, reducing
compensation. But CBS is asking its affiliates to broadcast
its two-hour morning news program and its lackluster
late-night programming if the stations are to avoid a
decrease in the annual payments.</p>
