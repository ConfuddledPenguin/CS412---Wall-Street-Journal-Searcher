	<p class="article-leader">American International Group Inc.'s stock price has fallen
steadily for several days, raising the prospect that the
insurer might have to sweeten its bid for International Lease
Finance Corp. in order to salvage the $1.3 billion
transaction.
   Since June 25, when the cash-and-stock agreement was
announced, American International's stock has dropped about
12.5% from its closing price that day of $75.20 a share,
adjusted for a recent 4-for-3 stock split. The shares closed
yesterday at $65.75, down $1, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms of the agreement, if American International's
stock is trading below $68.80 a share on Aug. 30, the day
before shareholders are scheduled to vote on the acquisition,
American International could be forced to issue more stock to
maintain the tax-free status of the transaction. And if the
stock drops below $66.40, which it did during yesterday's
session, then either side could walk away from the agreement.</p>
<p>The stock's weakness reflects concerns about the
acquisition, as well as the stock market's general decline.</p>
<p>Maurice Greenberg, American International's chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a brief interview late
yesterday, "We hope the {stock} price will rise. We hope the
terms will go through {as they are} and we hope everyone will
benefit" from this transaction.</p>
<p>He declined to speculate about whether terms might have to
be changed.</p>
<p>Louis Gonda, International Lease Finance's executive vice
president, said that "it's premature to discuss these
alternatives because it's not the fundamentals of either
company that's affecting the stock prices . . . We'll revisit
the issue a little closer to the closing date. Both companies
are as interested as ever to proceed with the merger."</p>
<p>Separately, International Lease Finance announced that
third-quarter pretax operating profit will nearly double from
the $17.3 million posted a year earlier. Total revenue for
the period, which will end Aug. 31, is expected to climb
almost 40% to $113 million from $81 million in the
year-earlier period. The results will be reported officially
in mid-September.</p>
<p>Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of the Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based jet-leasing company, said in an interview that
International Lease's strategy of building a portfolio of
newer, fuel-efficient planes will ultimately prove to be
sound, particularly as companies in the aviation industry
continue to face rising energy costs in the wake of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>International Lease Finance's stock fell $1.50 a share
yesterday to close at $27.50 in national over-the-counter
trading.</p>
<p>Herbert Goodfriend, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities in New York, said he believes both companies want
the agreement to go through, but American International can't
control the price of its stock in a generally declining
market. "They might have to amend the terms," he said.</p>
<p>A collapse of the transaction actually could help American
International's stock, said Udayan Ghose at Shearson Lehman
in New York, because many investors have been lukewarm about
the agreement from the start. He said they have feared the
big multinational insurer might be buying the company at the
top of a big growth cycle in the airline industry.</p>
<p>Along with other insurance stocks, American International
shares have been hurt by concerns about the Persian Gulf
crisis and attendant worries of rising inflation. Insurance
stock generally underperform the market during inflationary
times because their big bond portfolios suffer as bond prices
fall and claims usually rise.</p>
<p>Terms of the agreement call for International Lease
Finance holders to receive either $32.50 in cash or 50 cents
in cash plus 0.3 common share of American International for
each International Lease Finance share outstanding, subject
to a maximum number of shares and certain other adjustments.</p>
<p>Leslie Gonda, International Lease Finance's chairman,
Udvar-Hazy and Louis Gonda collectively control more than 50%
of the company's 36 million shares outstanding. They have
opted to take stakes in American International.</p>
