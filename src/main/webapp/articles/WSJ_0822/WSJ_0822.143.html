	<p class="article-leader">ARLINGTON, Va. -- USAir Group Inc. said it is dismissing
about 1,500 employees in another cutback at the airline
holding company. USAir also lost a bitter union battle.
   The airline said yesterday that the fired "employees were
hired in anticipation of an expansion program that has since
been reduced in light of current economic projections."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman said the 1,500 employees, including pilots,
flight attendants and customer service agents, represent
about 3% of the company's work force. Most of the employees
are considered "probationary," meaning they haven't completed
a probationary period that the company said typically lasts
six months.</p>
<p>The move follows an earlier cutback. Last week, the
company confirmed that it is furloughing 211 pilots starting
Jan. 1. The company yesterday indicated there is more to
come, saying: "Additional reductions in personnel will be
announced as determined."</p>
<p>Most U.S. carriers are anticipating that a downturn in the
economy will hurt traffic growth over the next few years, but
none have acted as swiftly as ailing USAir.</p>
<p>USAir has said it is going through a "detailed review" of
its plans for the next 12 to 24 months. Already the company
said it has dropped plans to start new service to certain
cities, which it refuses to identify.</p>
<p>The airline is also expected to reduce its fleet. Industry
analysts say the carrier will probably retire older planes
earlier than planned and defer deilvery of options to buy
planes. Earlier this summer, USAir postponed until 1995
delivery of a dozen Boeing Co. 737s that it had planned to
receive in 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>The company has been struggling since it merged its newly
acquired Piedmont Aviation unit into USAir last August. In
the first quarter, it suffered heavy losses amid widespread
customer service problems in areas such as on-time
performance and baggage delivery. Second-quarter operating
income of $59 million fell far below year-ago performance of
$201 million.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USAir
shares dropped 75 cents to close at $16.875.</p>
<p>Separately, the National Mediation Board ruled that USAir
"tainted the laboratory conditions necessary" for a fair
union representation election. The Teamsters union claimed
that USAir had illegally interfered with the union's campaign
to represent about 8,000 fleet service workers.</p>
<p>A USAir spokeswoman said, "We regret the decision." She
declined to comment further.</p>
<p>The board, which governs labor-management relations in the
airline and railroad industries, said the Teamsters could
seek a new election. The Teamsters hailed the decision as a
victory, and said it plans to wage "an all-out campaign" to
represent USAir workers.</p>
