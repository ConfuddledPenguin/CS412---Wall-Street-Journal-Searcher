	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co., fighting to retain its profitable share of
the European car market, is introducing a new model of its
strong-selling Escort today.
   Ford's European subsidiary, U.K.-based Ford of Europe
Inc., said it spent almost $2 billion over the past five
years developing the new Escort, the most it has ever
invested in a new European car. Company officials project
annual sales of 650,000 a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Escort is our largest program ever in Europe," says a
Ford spokesman. "We believe it puts us in a strong position
to face increased competition."</p>
<p>In recent years, Ford and rival U.S. car maker General
Motors Corp. have counted on record profits from the booming
European car market to cushion their difficulties at home.
European operations accounted for almost 40% of Ford's
world-wide net income on cars last year, and for more than
60% of GM's. Despite the debut of the new models in late
April, Escort's U.S. sales this year are off about 22%.</p>
<p>The European Escort is targeted at the "small family"
segment of the market, the largest and most fiercely
competitive sector of Europe's car market, accounting for
almost one in three of all new cars sold, Ford says.</p>
<p>Although the new Escort was redesigned to add interior
space, its boxy styling resembles the older model."It's
evolutionary, not revolutionary," says James Longhurst, an
auto analyst at James Capel & Co.</p>
