	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The European Community's executive commission
unveiled its final blueprint for monetary union.
   Among other things, the plan calls for setting up an EC
central bank by Jan. 1, 1993, which would mark the start of
"intensive preparations" for establishing a common monetary
policy and designating the European Currency Unit, or ECU, as
a single currency in the 12-nation bloc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission's plan is intended to form the basis for an
in-depth discussion of monetary union by EC finance ministers
Sept. 7 and 8 in Rome. In December, EC countries are to open
negotiations on amending the EC's founding Treaty of Rome for
monetary union.</p>
<p>But the debate is far from over. The government of British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is challenging the
commission's single-currency plan with proposals for a "hard
ECU" to be used as a 13th currency alongside the national
currencies. Only over a long period would the hard ECU evolve
into a single currency.</p>
<p>There's little support for the United Kingdom's plan in
the commission's latest proposals. Commission President
Jacques Delors of France said he is worried that the hard ECU
plan is only a delaying tactic and questioned whether the
U.K. is ready to go all the way toward EC economic and
monetary union.</p>
<p>But if the U.K. makes an unequivocal commitment to
economic and monetary union, then the hard ECU plan would
deserve serious consideration, Mr. Delors said. "If the
answer is yes, then the discussion becomes interesting," he
said.</p>
<p>A key element in the commission's plan is promoting the
use of the ECU by companies, central banks and borrowers. EC
officials say that if the ECU doesn't come into wider use in
the next few years, it will become increasingly difficult to
replace the dominating German mark with a new currency. The
U.K. proposals for a hard ECU could be a useful way to
promote wider use of the ECU, Mr. Delors said.</p>
<p>Although the ECU is used as the unit of account for most
official EC business, its private use remains marginal.
According to Price Waterhouse, the ECU currently accounts for
only 1% to 2% of all EC bank lending, and only 2% of EC trade
is denominated in ECUs, while 5% of all Eurobonds are
denominated in ECUs.</p>
<p>Among other points in the commission's blueprint for
monetary union:</p>
<p>-- The future EC treaty should explicitly designate the
ECU as the single currency.</p>
<p>-- The future EC central bank, dubbed "EuroFed," should
have price stability as its prime objective. The bank should
be independent from national governments and EC institutions,
and its task would be to implement monetary policy and
intervene in foreign-exchange markets. But "the choice of the
exchange-rate regime and the negotiation of international
monetary agreements should continue to be a matter for the
political authorities, assisted by the EuroFed," according to
the commission document.</p>
<p>-- The treaty should prohibit member states from financing
their budget deficits by printing money or through easy
credit. "Governments will have normal access to credit
through the market and will have to pay for it," said Henning
Christophersen, EC commissioner for economic and financial
affairs.</p>
<p>-- Contrary to the idea defended by many EC central
bankers, there would be no binding rules on the maximum size
of national budget deficits. Mr. Delors said political
pressure by member states, combined with market pressure,
would be enough to discourage any government from threatening
EC financial stability by engaging in reckless borrowing.</p>
