	<p class="article-leader">OLD GREENWICH, Conn. -- American Brands Inc. said it
completed the acquisition of Moen Group Inc. for $975
million.
   American Brands' wholly owned subsidiary, MasterBrand
Industries Inc., bought the Elyria, Ohio-based manufacturer
of kitchen and bathroom faucets from Forstmann, Little & Co.
The acquisition was first announced on July 20.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the purchase is part of American Brands'
attempt to sharpen its hardware and home-improvement
business. That is one of the areas where the company is
trying to diversify in order to reduce its dependence on
tobacco, which still generates a major portion of its sales
and operating profit.</p>
