	<div class="article-body"><p>NEW YORK -- When Richard B. Farrell arrived at his office
one Monday morning three years ago, he noticed a single sheet
of paper on his facsimile machine.</p>
<p>In three sentences of broken English, Elecompack Co.'s
owner Han Ichiro Naito conveyed the alarming news: It had
gone out of business. Mr. Farrell's company, which counted on
the Japanese firm as the sole supplier of the storage systems
it sold, never heard from Mr. Naito again. "We were dead,"
Mr. Farrell says.</p>
<p>Over the next nine months, Mr. Farrell and his associates
scrambled to save their company. They secured a temporary
alternative supplier and persuaded customers to accept the
new brand. Then they ventured into Japan's legal system,
bought Elecompack's patents from a court receiver and moved
manufacturing to the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. Farrell, 50 years old, wound up saving his company,
Automated Storage & Retrieval Systems of America Inc. But his
experience is a warning to entrepreneurs who think joining
forces with Japan guarantees success. Growing numbers of
American small businesses are indeed profiting handsomely
from their associations with prospering Japanese investors
and business partners. But when a Japanese concern runs into
financial problems, the resulting mess can mean endless
trouble for the U.S. partner.</p>
<p>"There are countless business failures in Japan,
especially among medium-sized and small companies," says
Carol Lyttle, a partner at Whitman & Ransom, a law firm here
that represents foreign companies, including now-defunct
Elecompack.</p>
<p>If the Japanese firm folds, the risk is greater that
principals such as Mr. Naito won't be around to help their
American partners deal with the fallout, Mr. Lyttle says. "A
declaration of bankruptcy in Japan is a far more serious
disgrace than it is in this country, not only in the business
community, but socially also," Mr. Lyttle says. "You're more
likely to find that a person will become as inconspicuous as
possible for a long time."</p>
<p>Tamotsu Hatasawa, a partner at Miyake, Hatasawa &
Yamazaki, a Tokyo law firm that represented Automated
Storage, adds, "In general terms, if the president is a
guarantor of its obligations when a Japanese company goes
bankrupt, it is not unusual for him to disappear." Mr. Naito
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Elecompack seemed sound enough when Mr. Farrell started
Automated Storage. He already had been selling Elecompack's
space-saving storage systems for two different U.S.
distributors for more than a decade. When his employer
dropped Elecompack in the early 1980s to make its own storage
system, Mr. Farrell decided to pick up the product line and
distribute it independently. "I was nobody," Mr. Farrell
says, "but I'd spent too many years selling this, and it was
too good a product." After months of talks, Mr. Naito named
Mr. Farrell's new company his exclusive distributor in North
America.</p>
<p>In its first year, Automated Storage sold $1.3 million of
Elecompack storage systems -- basically rows of shelving,
with no aisles in between, that part at the push of a button
when files are needed. As sales doubled annually for the next
two years, Mr. Farrell occasionally flew to Japan to solidify
relations. When Mr. Naito came to New York, he and his wife
went sailing on Long Island Sound in Mr. Farrell's boat.
"Everything was going along beautifully," Mr. Farrell says.</p>
<p>By 1986, however, problems were developing at Elecompack.
For one thing, to save money, some Elecompack distributors
had started buying directly from the company's subcontractors
and completing the assembly themselves. Consequently, even
though his systems were selling well, Mr. Naito profited less
from them.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Naito had begun spending on the
development of a new fully automated storage system for
warehouses instead of offices. Mr. Naito pursued the project
even after a potential financial partner declined to help him
raise money.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Farrell says, he had hardly expected Mr.
Naito's alarming fax three years ago. He picked it up and
read: "Dear Gentlemen, please excuse this sudden notice.
Unfortunately, Elecompack Co. Ltd. every activity {c}eased
today on April 13, 1987. We are all so thankfull for long
years friendship of all of yours. Best regards. Finally, Hank
Naito."</p>
<p>Says Mr. Farrell: "I was dumbfounded. I had struggled for
years, gone to Japan, created a dealer network. My life was
passing before me." Mr. Lyttle, who had known Mr. Naito for
10 years, but also received nothing more than the same
one-page notice, adds, "It completely surprised me."</p>
<p>With only one supplier, Mr. Farrell knew that his company
would have to scramble to stay in business. When Mr. Farrell
failed to locate Mr. Naito, his partner, Robert Gum, flew to
Tokyo. After confirming Elecompack's failure, Mr. Gum
arranged for one of its competitors to serve as a temporary
supplier until a permanent one was found.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Gum visited a Japanese freight forwarder that
was holding about a half-dozen shipments until it collected
overdue bills. "They attempted to get me to pay for them,"
says Mr. Gum. He refused and threatened to abandon the goods.
In the end, he says, he freed the machines at a price
slightly less than what Automated Storage normally paid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Farrell began approaching the 25 customers
who had ordered Elecompack machines that he couldn't deliver.
Even though the equipment from the new supplier cost 10% to
15% more than Elecompack's, Mr. Farrell agreed to sell it for
the same price and take a loss. Twenty customers accepted the
offer.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. Farrell set out to move manufacturing to the
U.S. With the help of Mr. Hatasawa, the Tokyo lawyer, he
decided to buy Elecompack's patent from the court trustee.
"At the outset, I was not optimistic at all," Mr. Hatasawa
recalls of Mr. Farrell's plan. "It's very difficult to
negotiate with a receiver." But several months of bargaining
later, Automated Storage was able to purchase the patents for
about $18,000.</p>
<p>With the patents in hand, Mr. Farrell found a U.S.
company, Patz Sales Inc., to make his storage systems to
Elecompack's specifications. Mr. Farrell spent the next eight
months with Patz, a maker of agricultural machinery, helping
prepare its Wisconsin factory for the task. In the process,
Mr. Farrell's company sank $250,000 into machine tools for
the venture.</p>
<p>By now, Automated Storage has recovered from the Japanese
disaster, Mr. Farrell says. The company is making a profit
and should sell about $6 million of systems in the U.S.,
Canada and the U.K. in its fiscal year ended June 30, 1991,
he adds. Earlier this year, the company beat a dozen
competitors to supply Paramount Pictures Corp. with more than
$1 million worth of storage systems to hold master copies of
the studio's films, Mr. Farrell says.</p>
<p>"We were talking about some fairly big numbers for a
couple of guys who had just about gone out of business," he
says.</p>
