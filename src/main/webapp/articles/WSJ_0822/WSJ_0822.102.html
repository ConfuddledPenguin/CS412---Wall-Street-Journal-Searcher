	<p class="article-leader">Wang Laboratories Inc. won a government computer contract
valued at up to $841 million over five years, the largest in
the company's history.
   The contract to supply computer systems and service to the
U.S. State Department and affiliated agencies represents a
big boost for Wang, which has struggled to reverse huge
losses and declining sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In American Stock Exchange trading, Wang's deeply
depressed Class B common stock soared $1.125, to close at
$4.50.</p>
<p>Analysts applauded the contract, but some cautioned that
big government sales can be fickle sources of profit. "It's
often very difficult to say whether all that money will
actually be spent, and at what level of profit," said John
Levinson of Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>A Wang spokesman said the $841 million contract value is
an estimate by the State Department of what it expects to
spend. Like many federal procurements, however, it is
formally considered an "indefinite delivery, indefinite
quantity" purchase agreement.</p>
<p>Richard W. Miller, Wang's president, hailed the new
business as a vote of confidence in the company's staying
power. "A single contract, even one of this size, isn't
enough to carry a company. But it's evidence of our
customers' confidence in Wang," he said.</p>
<p>Since the former General Electric Co. executive joined
Wang as its president, a year ago this week, the company has
sold off assets to slash bank debt from $575 million to $12
million, and reduced the work force from 28,000 last year to
about 19,500 today.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Miller repeated that he expects the
company to post a profit in the current year, ending June 30.
He called the State Department contract "a real morale boost.
This has been a rough year, but we're a lot stronger now and
our financial problems are behind us."</p>
<p>For the year ended June 30, Wang reported a $715.9 million
net loss, or $4.35 a share, including restructuring charges
of $388.3 million and losses from discontinued operations of
$87.3 million. Revenue, restated to reflect the sale of
operations, declined 14% to $2.5 billion. A year earlier,
Wang reported a net loss of $424.3 million, or $2.59 a share,
including restructuring charges of $142 million and losses
from discontinued operations of $100.1 million.</p>
<p>Under the contract, the Lowell, Mass.-based computer maker
will supply its flagship VS line of minicomputers, personal
computers and related equipment, software and training
support over the next five years, with extension options for
a total of 11 years. Included in the contract are such
applications as word processing, image processing, electronic
mail and messaging and database management.</p>
<p>Wang said one of the factors that worked in its favor in
landing the contract was its experience in building "secure"
computer systems that resist electronic eavesdropping. Wang
historically has had a big presence in the so-called Tempest
or secure system market.</p>
