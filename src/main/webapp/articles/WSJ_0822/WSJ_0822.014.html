	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said
his department doesn't expect an oil-supply disruption that
would require use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until
mid-September, at the earliest.
   Even then, a disruption -- and use of the reserve -- could
be averted by an increased draw-down of commercial domestic
stocks and higher production from such countries as Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some lawmakers and oil-industry officials have been urging
the Bush administration to sell oil from the reserve to help
calm oil markets and bring down prices. Bush administration
officials, however, have said they don't want the government
to get involved in influencing oil prices and fear that
dipping into the reserves would take pressure off Saudi
Arabia and other oil-producing countries to pump additional
crude. However, an outbreak of fighting in the region could
force the U.S. to tap the reserve.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Moore said his view on the timing of
any disruption is consistent with the views of officials from
other countries in the 21-nation International Energy Agency
and with the U.S. experience during the oil shock of 1973.
"The level of stocks world-wide is high," he said. "The loss
of crude really hasn't been felt yet. It's been handled by
the drawdown in private stocks."</p>
<p>Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the world oil markets have lost
the two countries' production of about four million barrels a
day. Mr. Moore said domestic stocks of crude oil and fuel oil
remain higher than usual, while supplies of gasoline are
lower than usual. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds about
590 million barrels of crude oil, which equals about 800 days
of U.S. imports from Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Moore said the Energy Department is
working to come up with additional ways of boosting domestic
production, increasing conservation and encouraging industry
to use fuels other than oil. Mr. Moore said the department is
considering steps that would be longer-term and more
controversial than its first package, though he wouldn't
elaborate.</p>
<p>As part of the first plan, the administration announced
that oil companies have agreed to boost production from the
North Slope of Alaska; urged Americans to put more air in
automobile tires and increase car-pooling; and said it would
mediate a California dispute that is blocking production of
200 million to 300 million barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said the department is working with the White
House on ways to get the conservation message out through a
public-information campaign.</p>
<p>The Bush administration does plan to renew its push for
tax incentives to encourage domestic oil and gas production,
including changes that would reduce the burden of the
alternative minimum tax on producers. In the administration's
budget proposal last January, the various tax changes aimed
at the industry were estimated to cost $300 million in the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore was hopeful that the Mideast crisis might prompt
environmentalists and other opponents of drilling in the
Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to reconsider the situation.</p>
<p>The department doesn't plan to recommend a reversal of
President Bush's decision to delay oil drilling in
environmentally sensitive areas off the California and
Florida coasts. "Even if we withdrew the decision tomorrow,
there would still be two to five years of environmental work"
and other preparation before drilling could start, he said,
so it would be of little use in the current crisis.</p>
<p>Similarly, the department isn't planning to push the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to speed up its
consideration of a proposed Iroquois pipeline to bring
Canadian natural gas to the Northeastern U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore predicted that Congress will return from its
August recess "flush with legislative ideas to solve the
crisis." Among those will be a push to require auto makers to
improve significantly the fuel economy of their fleets. While
he said the administration would have to take a look at this
and other proposals, he gave no indication that the White
House will reverse its opposition to the measure, pushed by
Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.).</p>
