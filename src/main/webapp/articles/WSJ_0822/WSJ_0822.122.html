	<p class="article-leader">MOLINE, Ill. -- Deere & Co., citing continued strong North
American retail sales of John Deere agricultural equipment,
said earnings for its fiscal third quarter rose 16% to $114.1
million, or $1.50 a share.
   In the same quarter the previous year, the maker of farm
and industrial equipment had net income of $98.2 million, or
$1.30 a share. Sales for the quarter, ended July 31, rose 6%
to $2.06 billion from $1.93 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the nine months, the company earned $336.6 million, or
$4.44 a share, compared with $277 million, or $3.69 a share,
the previous year. Sales rose 11% to $5.82 billion from $5.22
billion.</p>
<p>Deere said the quarter and year-to-date improvements are
attributable to increased sales, higher production and
improved operating efficiency in its North American farm
equipment operations.</p>
<p>The company said that despite the strong sales of its
agricultural equipment, declining consumer spending for
durable goods is resulting in lower retail sales of its lawn
and grounds care products.</p>
<p>"This pattern will likely continue during the remainder of
this year and into early 1991," Deere said. The company added
that it now expects retail sales of lawn and grounds care
products to be "significantly lower" in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Deere said it is now "less certain" because
of the effects of a weaker economy on consumer confidence and
spending and construction activity.</p>
