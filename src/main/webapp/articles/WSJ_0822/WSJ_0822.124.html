	<p class="article-leader">Gasoline and crude oil prices swung wildly in heavy
trading to end mostly higher in another session dominated by
activities in the Middle East.
   Market players have been interpreting almost every
pronouncement, every troop movement and every rumor as
bullish in recent weeks. While crude prices have soared,
gasoline futures have risen even more, eclipsing a New York
Mercantile Exchange record.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You can throw technicals out the window and fundamentals
out the window," said a trader at one large trading house.
"It's become standard procedure this month."</p>
<p>Gasoline for September delivery ended at $1.0126 a gallon,
up 1.01 cents, on the New York Merc. While the gain was small
compared with some recent days' trading, the session was
volatile. The contract shot up around five cents at the
opening to trade as high as $1.0650.</p>
<p>Gasoline's gains have exceeded crude's on the belief that
supplies are tight and refining capacity in the U.S. is
limited. "U.S. refiners have `maxed out' on their
production," said one trader. "They have no excess capacity,"
he said, although "there is still crude around."</p>
<p>After trading finished in New York, the American Petroleum
Institute said U.S. refineries operated at 92.3% of capacity
in the week ended Friday. That's down from the previous week,
but any level above 90% is considered as maximum operations.</p>
<p>Around the middle of yesterday's session, market
participants were caught by surprise by a speech by Saddam
Hussein that they interpreted as milder in tone. "They felt
it was a softening in the rhetoric, and prices collapsed," an
analyst said. Many traders took advantage of the news to take
profits. September gasoline traded as low as 95.5 cents a
gallon before recovering.</p>
<p>Crude oil contracts basically moved in tandem with
gasoline, with most contracts ending with small increases. It
was the last day of trading in September crude contracts,
which ended at $28.41 a barrel, down 15 cents.</p>
<p>Traders were expecting a bullish inventory report from the
American Petroleum Institute yesterday afternoon and didn't
get one. But it's difficult in this kind of market to predict
how much of an effect the actual figures will have.</p>
<p>The API said crude oil stocks fell 271,000 barrels to
375.7 million; analysts had expected a decline of more than
four million barrels. Gasoline inventories actually
increased, by 1.5 million barrels to 214 million; analysts
had expected them to drop by more than two million barrels.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices ended lower after
fluctuating in a $15-an-ounce range on Middle Eastern
developments. Silver and platinum also declined. December
delivery gold settled at $416 an ounce, down $2.80. It was as
high as $425 in early trading and then plunged as low as $410
after news services quoted the Iraqi foreign minister as
saying Iraq was willing to talk with the U.S. and put the
Mideast situation before the United Nations. "They may have
read more in the reports than actually was there," one
analyst said. Later, prices partly rebounded when a U.S.
spokesman reiterated the strong U.S. stand on freeing of
foreign hostages held by Baghdad and an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait. Ken Gettinger, precious metals vice president for the
New York branch of the Union Bank of Switzerland, said that
from a technical viewpoint, gold should find support at $400
an ounce and resistance at $425. Yesterday was the fourth
time that the December contract has touched or approached
$425. It traded at $424.80 Aug. 13 and at $425 twice in
March.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices dropped for the third
consecutive session. The September contract ended 1.95 cents
a pound lower at $1.6675. That brought its total decline to
14.2 cents since Thursday, just before Brazil announced a
reduction in export prices. Brazilian processors of frozen
concentrate are engaged in price-cutting competition, an
analyst said. But it isn't likely that Brazil will announce
further significant price reductions, the analyst said,
before the first estimate of the Florida orange crop, which
is expected in October. The crop is expected to show a slight
improvement from the frost-damaged 1989-90 harvest. But
Brazilian processors won't want to cut their prices much
further in case there is a drop in the Florida forecast, the
analyst said. Brazilian concentrate is about to begin
arriving in the U.S., helping to ease concern about supplies,
the analyst said.</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Traders said ADM Investor Services,
the futures trading unit of grain-processing giant
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., sold 3,000 soybean oil futures
contracts, diminishing a position large enough to spawn
rumors that ADM was trying to corner the soybean oil market.
The firm was thought to hold more than half of all receipts
for delivery of soybean oil based on July and August futures
contracts, which show ownership of the oil stored in
warehouses. But rumors that ADM may intend to corner the
market eased as analysts said the company may have built up
its large position for legitimate business reasons. Among
those reasons, they said, were expectations that fast-food
restaurants will boost the demand for soybean oil by
switching for health reasons from lard to vegetable oils for
use in frying. In addition, the company may be banking on
speculation that the U.S. will have to offer more credit to
the Soviet Union for grain purchases because of widespread
food shortages in that country.</p>
