	<p class="article-leader">Control Data Corp. said the Commerce Department granted an
export license to ship six of the company's largest computers
to the Soviet Union, where they will monitor nuclear power
plant performance.
   The Cyber 960 mainframe machines made by the
Minneapolis-based manufacturer are valued at a total of $32
million and are believed the most powerful exported to the
U.S.S.R. Shipment will begin next month, Control Data said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ordered after the disaster at the Soviets' Chernobyl
reactor, the computers will analyze safety factors at
civilian power-generating plants. The export license followed
assurances that the computers would be limited to safety
analysis.</p>
