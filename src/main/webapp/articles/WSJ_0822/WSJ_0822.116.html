	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. said it agreed in
principle to increase by 25 cents a share, to $22.25 a share,
or $48.4 million, its tender offer for the 13.4% stake it
doesn't already hold in Caesars New Jersey Inc.
   The sweetened offer is part of a settlement of litigation
brought by certain shareholders of Caesars New Jersey. They
charged that, among other things, the company's original
$47.9 million offer was inadequate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Caesars World, an owner and operator of hotels and
casinos, also extended its offer to Sept. 7 from today, and
said it might further extend the offer until final court
approval of the settlement, which isn't expected for at least
two months. Caesars New Jersey owns and operates Caesars
Atlantic City, a hotel and casino.</p>
<p>Caesars World also agreed to amend its offer to pay
interest on $22 a share if the offer is extended more than 30
days after the mailing of supplemental offer materials
describing the settlement and the amendment. The mailing is
expected this week.</p>
<p>Caesars World also agreed that if it purchases at least
549,792 Caesars New Jersey shares, giving Caesars World at
least 90% of the outstanding shares, it will merge Caesars
New Jersey with Caesars World or a Caesars World subsidiary.
In the merger, shareholders would receive $22.25 a share,
without interest. Of the 2,175,945 Caesars New Jersey shares
that Caesars World doesn't already own, about 1.5 million had
been tendered as of yesterday.</p>
