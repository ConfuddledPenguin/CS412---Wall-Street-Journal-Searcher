	<p class="article-leader">LOCKHEED Corp. (Calabasas, Calif.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it downgraded about $800 million of this
aerospace concern's senior long-term debt to Baa-1 from
single-A-3. The agency cited the "less favorable
defense-business outlook and the likelihood that the
company's cash-flow protection of debt will decline, while
its borrowings will increase." Lockheed's Prime-2
commercial-paper rating wasn't changed.</p>
