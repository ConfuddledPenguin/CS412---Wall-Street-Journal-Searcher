	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A sell-off in overseas stock markets sparked
by Mideast war rumors spilled over into U.S. stocks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 50 points in the
first half hour of trading and ended 52.48 points lower at
2603.96 in hectic trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adding fuel to the decline early in the day was a sharp
drop in bond prices, caused by rising oil prices and news
reports that suggested hostilities were about to break out in
the Mideast. Long-term Treasury bond prices later recovered
to end just slightly lower. The dollar was mixed.</p>
<p>Ted Eggert, equity research manager at Yamaichi
International, said the selling of stocks was indiscriminate.
"They took them out across the board," he said, citing big
declines in such stalwarts as Merck and Philip Morris. And
though Boeing and PepsiCo had positive news, their stocks
fell.</p>
<p>The stock market was poised for heavy selling even without
the influence of big drops in European markets, said Paul
Hennessey, head of stock trading at Boston Co. "The market
looked better than it actually was" at the end of Monday's
session, he said, referring to the modest rise in the Dow on
thin volume with broader market indexes not performing as
well.</p>
<p>Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First
Securities, attributed the early, sharp slide to a 5.2%
decline in the West German stock market. The sell-off was
sparked by an unsubstantiated rumor that Iraq had shot down a
U.S. war plane. Further heightening the market's fear that
Mideast fighting was imminent were renewed reports that Iraq
had moved missiles into southern Kuwait.</p>
<p>"The foreign markets created the down draft," Mr. Pedersen
said. He added that Monday's rebound in the Dow industrials
failed to deliver the gains that some traders had expected
after the Dow resisted closing below 2640, a "support level,"
on Friday. Mr. Pedersen sees the Dow falling to around 2500
before the current slide ends.</p>
<p>Swings in oil prices contributed to big moves in the bond
market. "Treasurys rode a roller coaster driven by the oil
market," said Raymond Stone, managing director at Stone &
Mccarthy Research Associates, Princeton, N.J. As oil prices
rose early in the day, bonds fell, losing three quarters of a
point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. But in the late
morning, oil prices fell and bonds rebounded on an apparent
indication that Iraq wanted to talk peace.</p>
<p>Though the perception of peace overtures faded as the day
wore on, bonds didn't resume their decline because investors
who had sold bonds before the peace news hit were busily
buying them back.</p>
<p>The muddled interpretation of Mideast developments left
many bond traders on the losing side for the day, said
Roberta D. Olson, fixed-income portfolio manager at Bance One
Asset Management, Columbus, Ohio. "Once again, it's a crap
shoot," she said.</p>
<p>"A lot of the volatility in the stock and bond markets
transferred into foreign exchange," said Robert White,
manager of corporate foreign-exchange trading at First
Interstate Bank, Los Angeles. The declines in stocks and
bonds helped drag the dollar lower, but it later recovered
and closed mixed against major currencies. Currencies of
countries with high interest rates, such as Canada and
Australia, continued attracting traders. But activity overall
was very light, Mr. White said, because many players in Asia
and Europe are on holiday.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell on volume of 194.6 million shares in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining
issues overwhelmed advancers by 1,441 to 243.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell slightly. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.94%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5645 marks, down from 1.5650 late
Monday, and at 146.65 yen, up from 146.44 yen Monday.</p>
