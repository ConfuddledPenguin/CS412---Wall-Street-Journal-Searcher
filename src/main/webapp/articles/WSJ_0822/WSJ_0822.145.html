	<p class="article-leader">OKLAHOMA CITY -- American First Corp., unable to pay
dividends owed to holders of preferred stock, said it is
giving them something else instead -- ownership of the
company's largest subsidiary, Tricon America Corp.
   The holding company wouldn't specify a value for Tricon,
except to say it is "substantially less" than $10 million. It
said Tricon, a concrete building and fiber glass vault maker,
accounted for virtually all of the parent's revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After American First missed a dividend payment totaling
$25,000, holders of its $10 convertible preferred stock
demanded full redemption of the $1 million issue, the company
said, adding that it was unable to comply. At that point,
provisions of the preferred issue called for transfer of all
the common stock of Tricon America to the preferred holders.
American First said most of the preferred is held by a
limited partnership, ML Oklahoma Venture Partners.</p>
<p>In the nine months ended June 30, American First's loss
widened to $2.9 million, or 56 cents a share, from $1.4
million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the
latest nine months was $7.2 million; the company didn't have
any year-earlier revenue, because it didn't yet own Tricon.</p>
<p>American First President John W. Cox said, "We did not
have the available resources to continue to fund Tricon's
operations and were unsuccessful in our attempt to raise
capital from outside sources."</p>
<p>The company also has minor interests in real estate and in
computer leasing.</p>
