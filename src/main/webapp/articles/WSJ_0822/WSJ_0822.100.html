	<p class="article-leader">MT. KISCO, N.Y. -- Trans World Airlines Inc. said it plans
to raise domestic fares Aug. 30 because of rising jet fuel
prices, likely prompting other carriers to delay their fare
increases until then.
   TWA said it will raise fares 5.3%, the same amount that
other airlines had announced last week. Those increases are
scheduled to take effect tomorrow but will now probably be
postponed until Aug. 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Carriers, which rarely raise fares without the
participation of their competitors, give advance notice of
the increases to give others time to match them.</p>
<p>TWA said the cost of jet fuel, one of the industry's
biggest expenses, has risen significantly since Iraq invaded
Kuwait early this month.</p>
<p>The industry-wide fare increases will affect all tickets
for an indefinite time. Most airlines are still offering
discounts on heavily restricted fares that require at least
one-week advance purchase. The discounts, which range from
15% to 40% on regular prices, also require that tickets be
purchased by Aug. 29, the day before TWA plans to raise its
fares.</p>
