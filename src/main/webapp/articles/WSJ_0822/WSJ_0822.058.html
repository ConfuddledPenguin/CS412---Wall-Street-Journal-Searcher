	<p class="article-leader">LITITZ, Pa. -- Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. said an
agreement to purchase Elmwood Federal Savings Bank for about
$24 million in stock was ended because of "recent changes in
market conditions."
   The decision to call off the purchase was made by mutual
consent, the banks said. In May, Susquehanna lowered its
previous $27 million offer for Elmwood, based in Media, Pa.,
because of weak conditions in the banking market.</p>
