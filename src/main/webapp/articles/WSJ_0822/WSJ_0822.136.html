	<p class="article-leader">Dayton Hudson Corp. said net income rose 7% in the fiscal
second quarter, despite the negative impact of its recent
acquisition of the Marshall Field's department store chain.
   The Minneapolis-based retailer earned $59.8 million, or 75
cents a share, for the period ended Aug. 4, compared with $56
million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. The Field's
acquisition reduced earnings in the quarter by about 15 cents
a share, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue for the period rose 3.2% to $3.2 billion from $3.1
billion.</p>
<p>The company said it expects the Field's acquisition to
reduce earnings in the third and fourth quarters by a total
of five cents a share. The company said interest and
depreciation expenses related to the Field's acquisition
would offset Field's contribution to operating earnings in
1990.</p>
<p>For the first six months, Dayton Hudson said net income
rose 28% to $123.9 million, or $1.56 a share, from $96.8
million, or $1.23 a share. The latest period includes a net
gain of $6.6 million, or nine cents a share, for accounting
changes.</p>
<p>Revenue in the six months rose nearly 6% to $6.25 billion
from $5.92 billion.</p>
