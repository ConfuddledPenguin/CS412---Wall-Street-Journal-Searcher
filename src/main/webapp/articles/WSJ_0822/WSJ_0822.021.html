	<p class="article-leader">OHIO EDISON, Akron, said it cut its dividend after the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio cut its rate increase
request of $218 million to $142 million. The rate increase
was intended to recover costs associated with its share of
Beaver Valley 2, a generating unit. The commission's decision
requires that the utility take immediate action to preserve
its financial health and protect the long-term interests of
all stockholders by setting the dividend at a sustainable
level.</p>
