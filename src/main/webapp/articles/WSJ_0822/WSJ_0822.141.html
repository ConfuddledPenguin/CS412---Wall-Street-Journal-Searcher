	<p class="article-leader">Pakhoed Holding N.V., a Dutch transport and tank storage
concern, said it is holding merger talks with Furness N.V., a
Dutch shipping company.
   Dutch analysts said that if the merger proceeds, as
expected, this would complete a long-term consolidation with
four Dutch companies effectively running stevedoring services
in Rotterdam, Europe's largest port: Pakhoed, Van Ommeren
Ceteco N.V., Koninklijke Nedlloyd Groep N.V. and
Internatio-Muller N.V.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the terms being discussed, Pakhoed would offer one
share or certificate of share in Pakhoed plus 130 guilders
for two shares or certificates of shares in Furness, which
analysts valued at 140 million guilders ($79.4 million) to
160 million guilders.</p>
<p>Separately, Pakhoed posted a 64% increase in first-half
profit to 69.2 million guilders, including a gain of 8.7
million guilders from an asset sale, from 42.2 million
guilders a year earlier, when Pakhoed had a net loss from
extraordinary items of 1.2 million guilders. Excluding
extraordinary items, Pakhoed's profit from ordinary
operations rose 39% to 60.5 million guilders from 43.4
million guilders.</p>
