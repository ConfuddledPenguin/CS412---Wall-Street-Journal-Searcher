its quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 15 cents.
The reduced dividend is payable Oct. 5 to shareholders of
record Sept. 21.
   The maker of typewriters and personal word processors has
had a series of setbacks in the year since Hanson PLC, the
company's British owner, sold 50% of Smith Corona's stock to
the public.</p>
