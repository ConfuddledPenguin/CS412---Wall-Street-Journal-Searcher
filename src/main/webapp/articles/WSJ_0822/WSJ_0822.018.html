	<p class="article-leader">MONROEVILLE, Pa. -- Parkvale Financial Corp. said its
board authorized the buy-back of as many as 85,300 shares, or
5% of the company's common shares outstanding.
   The repurchases will be made over the next six months in
the open market. Robert J. McCarthy Jr., president and chief
executive officer, said the current stock price "does not
adequately reflect the company's long-term business and
earnings prospects."</p>
