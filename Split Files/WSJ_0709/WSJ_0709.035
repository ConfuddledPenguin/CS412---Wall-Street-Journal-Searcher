   NEW YORK -- Wall Street may be suffering from a recession,
but the lowly stockbroker still commands a good paycheck.
   Average earnings of U.S. securities brokers who deal with
the public rose 10.4% last year to $78,711 a broker, the
Securities Industry Association reported in its annual survey
of broker pay.

   It was the first gain in broker pay since 1986, when
average broker earnings rose to a record $97,100 from $79,575
in 1985, the securities association said.
   Why the pay gain last year? Brokers who serve the public
get paid largely through commissions on transactions, and
their commissions are higher when the market rises. Last
year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 27%. Also,
the pay gains reflect a business pickup last year at various
regional brokerage firms taking part in the survey.
   The securities association's pay survey covered 52 member
brokerage firms, which employ 39,000 sales people, or close
to half of the industry's total sales personnel.
