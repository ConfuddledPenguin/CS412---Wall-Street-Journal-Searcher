   I was very pleased to see that someone outside the medical
profession has recognized Roger Hall for his accomplishments
in the fields of baseball and softball (page-one article on
Rogers Break Away Bases, May 25).
   The article characterizes Mr. Hall and his idea as a
curiosity, a human-interest anomaly, with little credibility
or backing. Mr. Hall's product is supported by substantial
medical studies that have scientifically documented the
effectiveness of his Break Away Base, and the impact this
base could have on professional and recreational athletes.

   The Rogers Break Away Base was a breakthrough in sports
safety equipment and should have been welcomed as a needed
progressive improvement. For 13 years, Mr. Hall, far from
receiving encouragement for making our national pastime a
safer sport for all, met with resistance from the sports and
business sectors.
   In 1986 we initiated a study at the University of Michigan
in which we found that 71% of all recreational-softball
injuries were due to sliding. We then instituted a four-year
study and found that 96% of all softball-related injuries due
to sliding could be prevented, and that 99% of the
health-care costs could be prevented. It was then that the
Centers for Disease Control became involved to perform an
actuarial analysis on our data, based upon use of Mr. Hall's
product, and found that the implementation of these bases
across the U.S. could prevent approximately 1.7 million
injuries a year, with a saving of $2 billion in acute
health-care costs a year.
   The medical community, in particular the
orthopedic-surgery community, has embraced Mr. Hall's product
with open arms.
