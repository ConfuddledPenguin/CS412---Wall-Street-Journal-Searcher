   EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- N.V. Philips said it plans
to sell its Dutch transport and freight-forwarding operations
to Royal Nedlloyd Group N.V.
   Philips and Nedlloyd didn't disclose terms of the planned
sale but said the operations involved employ about 450
people. The two companies said they are still discussing the
services that Philips would need under the new arrangement.

   By turning over its transport and logistics departments to
outside specialists, the Dutch electronics giant is seeking
to concentrate on its core businesses.
   For Rotterdam-based Nedlloyd, the purchase would be the
latest in a series of acquisitions that have boosted its
annual revenue from road transport to about two billion Dutch
guilders ($1.1 billion) from 700 million guilders two years
ago. The acquisitions have made Nedlloyd one of Europe's
biggest trucking and logistics companies and reduced its
dependence on the depressed ocean-shipping trade.
