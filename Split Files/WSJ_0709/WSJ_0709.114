   WASHINGTON -- The urge to do something is understandable.
   After all, consider the problem. Although Japan continues
to rack up big trade surpluses with the U.S., the yen keeps
sagging against the dollar. That only makes Japanese goods
cheaper for voracious American consumers -- and U.S. products
costlier for the less-than-voracious Japanese consumers. And
that makes the deficit even more intractable.

   One obvious solution? Increase the value of the yen. The
U.S. and other nations have tried to do just that -- by
buying yen in foreign-exchange markets. The recent actions,
however, have been less than successful. More important,
though, they have ignited the debate about the value of such
government intervention. They have also pitted the
interventionist Treasury against the hands-off Federal
Reserve Board.
   Little wonder, then, that several economists expect
intervention to be discussed at the Houston summit. "The
second most important thing that the summiteers could do
{after the talks on trade} is stop the terrible amount of
foreign-exchange intervention," says Allan Meltzer, an
economist at Carnegie Mellon University, who leaves little
doubt where he stands on the debate.
   Opponents such as Mr. Meltzer contend that intervention is
a form of protectionism. Intervention can't have any lasting
effects, they argue, because the foreign-exchange markets are
so huge and because it is an artificial attempt by
governments to override the markets' decisions. Opponents
also note that the U.S. has frequently lost money as a result
of such moves.
   The advocates of intervention maintain that by acting
together, the world's most powerful central banks can tell --
and convince -- foreign-exchange markets that a currency is
trading at the wrong price. Central-bank actions, they
believe, can influence or at least smooth the markets.
   They point to the success of the accord struck at New
York's Plaza Hotel by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France
and Britain in September 1985 to push down the value of the
U.S. dollar. But, as even many intervention advocates
concede, the governments through their intervention were
reinforcing what the markets had already begun to believe:
that the dollar was substantially overvalued.
   "Our view is that intervention can be effective if it's
done decisively and jointly," says John Williamson, a senior
fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a
liberal Washington think tank.
   Even such advocates, however, have their complaints. In
this year's attempt to prop up the yen, major central banks
"weren't doing it jointly," Mr. Williamson says. "For a
while," he maintains, "the Americans appeared to have lost
interest." The Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board
couldn't agree on what the appropriate action should be, and
this sent confusing signals to the market, Mr. Williamson
argues.
   Since the Western world's largest economies moved to
floating exchange rates in 1973, there have been many
instances of concerted intervention -- with varying degrees
of success. Of course, those who favor a return to fixed
exchange rates point out that one of the advantages of such a
system is that it removes the need to intervene to influence
the value of currencies.
   One of the more controversial pieces of coordinated
intervention occurred after the Louvre Accord of February
1987. As a result of that accord, the Group of Seven,
comprising the world's major economies, agreed to try to stem
the decline of the dollar, and even set specific secret
currency ranges. That accord is generally regarded as having
been less successful than the Plaza agreement.
   It was the Treasury's desire earlier this year to push the
dollar down -- particularly against the yen -- that led to
confrontation with the Fed in March and April. In April the
dollar was worth close to 160 yen, up sharply from 144 yen in
June of last year.
   The Fed saw intervention, which involved the selling of
dollars by many countries, as dangerous "dollar-bashing" that
might damage the central bank's campaign to hold down
inflation. (A cheaper dollar means that imported goods cost
Americans more.) The Fed wanted yen-boosting intervention
only if the participating countries each sold their own
currencies -- not the dollar -- against the yen. But other
nations, especially Germany, declined, fearing inflationary
pressures in their own economies.
   "I've never objected to intervention to support the yen,
but that {intervention} has been translated into general
dollar sales," Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said in an
interview earlier this year.
   At the March 27 meeting of the Fed's Open Market
Committee, the record says that "many expressed strong
skepticism that intervention operations can by themselves
have a lasting effect on the value of the dollar in
foreign-currency markets, given that the effects of these
operations are routinely sterilized."
   Such operations are sterilized when the Fed withdraws from
circulation a similar number of dollars to those put into
circulation by intervening. Thus, if the Fed spent $10
million on intervening, it might sell $10 million of
short-term Treasury securities, siphoning those dollars out
of the marketplace. The purpose is to damp down inflation.
Advocates of intervention would argue that the two operations
are separate: that the intervention depresses the dollar in
the foreign-exchange markets while the later sale of
securities absorbs excess dollars from the general economy.
Opponents, such as those on the Fed, would argue that the two
operations largely cancel each other out.
   Among those most opposed to intervention is the president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, W. Lee Hoskins. In
an article in the Cleveland Fed's Economic Commentary
newsletter, Mr. Hoskins and Owen Humpage, an economic adviser
to the Cleveland Fed, disparage government attempts to
influence exchange rates as "monetary protectionism."
"Interventionist policies may be politically appealing," they
say, because a lower dollar helps American businessmen sell
goods abroad. The two argue, however, that such policies are
"economically myopic," because they merely put off the need
for businessmen to improve productivity and performance.
   But central bankers in this country can quarrel all they
want about U.S. intervention policy. It's the Treasury -- not
the bankers -- that sets the policy, albeit "in consultation"
with the Fed. Thus, at the March 27 meeting, the Open Market
Committee, despite the Fed's general reluctance toward
intervention, raised to $25 billion the total value of
foreign currencies it can hold at any one time. That was an
increase of only $4 billion in the limit on the committee's
holdings of foreign currencies. But since May 1989 the limit
has risen 108%, according to a record of the meeting.
   The Fed's "warehousing" of foreign currencies for the
Treasury also has jumped. At that same March meeting, the 12
Fed governors voted 9-3 to raise warehousing limits to $15
billion from $10 billion. It was only last September that the
committee had doubled that limit to $10 billion.
("Warehousing" -- which increases the Treasury's ability to
intervene -- refers to a complex series of transactions in
which the Fed, in effect, holds foreign currencies for the
Treasury for a certain period.)
   Advocates of intervention say that despite the increase,
the overall amount of foreign currency held by the U.S.
remains relatively lower than that of other nations. "One
really shouldn't get over-agitated about the size of
foreign-currency holdings," says Mr. Williamson. "U.S.
holdings are really quite modest compared to those of other
countries."
   The Fed concedes that point but takes a different
approach. It says in its Open Market Committee record that
holdings of foreign currencies are at "historically high
levels" for the U.S. and warns that this carries "the risk of
sizable losses if the dollar strengthens."
   The Fed, however, has a short memory. Not so many years
ago, in the early 1980s, it was arguing the other side of the
intervention case. Under Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, it
was Fed Chairman Paul Volcker who was pleading with the
Treasury to intervene more to hold down the surging value of
the dollar. Mr. Regan, a hands-off free marketeer, didn't
follow Mr. Volcker's advice.
   Previous policy in the Reagan administration was "nothing
like what's happened" in this administration, complains Prof.
Meltzer, the avid anti-interventionist. Current policymakers,
he says, have "just gone berserk."
