   I am writing to follow up on an environmental item that
appeared in "Notable &amp; Quotable" on April 20. The item
begins: "Environmental Protection Agency analyst E.G.
Vallianatos, writing in the Oct. 10 issue of the Chicago
Tribune . . ." and goes on to reprint Mr. Vallianatos's
fanatical diatribe against capitalism as an "earth-heating,
destructive, suicidal system."
   I wish to make it very clear that Mr. Vallianatos's
personal opinions expressed in the quoted piece represent
neither the policies of the Environmental Protection Agency
nor the views of this administration. Mr. Vallianatos is a
midlevel analyst in the biological division of EPA's Office
of Pesticide Programs and has no professional knowledge of
nor acquaintance with the development or dissemination of
policy regarding the problems of climate change or global
warming.

   In the future, may I suggest that the opinions of
individual EPA employees no more represent agency policy than
the opinions of one working for General Motors, the Sierra
Club or the Marriott Corp. Unless officially transmitted,
they are personal views.
