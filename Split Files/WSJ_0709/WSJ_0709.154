   DETROIT -- Japanese auto makers grabbed a record share of
U.S. car sales in the first half, which ended with a late
June sales surge.
   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks in late June
rose 11.9% to the most robust sales pace in six months,
bringing some relief to a struggling industry.

   But the big winners for the first half of the year were
the Japanese, who took 28% of total car sales -- domestic and
imported -- compared with just 24% in the year-earlier
period. Detroit's share dropped to 65% from 69%.
   Never before has Japanese market share been so high for a
six-month period, says John Casesa, auto analyst with
Wertheim Schroeder &amp; Co. in New York. "Japanese market share
will continue to increase," he predicts.
   Among the first half's highlights:
   -- Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. were the big winners. Their car sales surged
31.5%, 13.5% and 88%, respectively, thanks to big increases
in production from their U.S. factories.
   -- The Japanese had some losers as well, however. Nissan
Motor Co.'s first-half car sales dropped 13.6%, and Subaru of
America Inc.'s sales plunged 31.1%. Neither company has
strong products in the major segments of the market.
   -- General Motors Corp., a big loser in recent years, held
its own in the first half, with a 35.7% car-market share,
about equal with a year earlier. But Ford Motor Co.'s market
share dipped nearly two percentage points, to 20.8%, while
Chrysler Corp.'s share nose-dived to 8.9% from 10.6% a year
earlier.
   Detroit's Big Three did better in the light truck market
because of their strength in pickups, minivans and Jeep-like
vehicles. Japanese auto makers are just beginning to make
serious stabs at this growing part of the overall vehicle
market.
   Domestically produced cars hit a seasonally adjusted
annual selling rate of 8.1 million vehicles in late June, far
higher than forecast and the strongest selling pace since
early January. It compares with a 7.1 million rate a year ago
and a 6.8 million rate in mid-June of this year.
   "I feel there's some momentum with us now," says Fred
Ricart, a Columbus, Ohio, Ford dealer, who had strong sales
in late June. If so, that bodes well for the U.S. economy,
because it would portend a pickup in consumer spending.
Analysts and auto makers caution, however, that one 10-day
sales period alone isn't enough to warrant strong
conclusions.
   But throughout the first half, Japanese auto makers as a
group turned in a strong performance. Their unprecedented
market share stems directly from their rapidly growing U.S.
manufacturing operations. Ironically, only a few years ago,
Big Three executives were calling for the Japanese to build
factories in the U.S. to create a "level playing field" of
competition.
   Some Japanese companies, notably Toyota and Mitsubishi,
are aggressively pursuing fleet sales, once the exclusive
domain of Detroit's Big Three. And while Detroit's quality
has improved greatly in recent years, the Japanese still
lead, especially in the minds of many consumers. "The
perception that the Japanese cars are better is still out
there," said analyst David Healey of Barclays de Zoette Wedd
in New York City.
   Honda Motor Co. sold 86,872 cars for all of June, a 58.2%
increase from a year earlier. A company spokesman said
year-ago sales were pulled down in the wake of a dealer
incentive program that ended in May 1989.
   GM posted an especially strong 18.2% gain in total vehicle
sales for the last 10 days of June. The No. 1 car maker's
Chevrolet and Pontiac divisions each had big increases. "As
we begin the final months of the 1990 model year and enter
into the second half of the calendar year, we are optimistic
that General Motors will continue to improve its market
share," said James B. Fitzpatrick, GM's vice president of
marketing and product planning.
   Ford, meanwhile, saw its overall sales rise 2% in late
June from a year ago, well below the rest of the market.
Ford's domestic truck sales rose 14.1%, but its domestic car
sales dropped 4.7%.
   Chrysler's total vehicle sales fell 12.6% in late June,
continuing a pattern of badly lagging its competitors that
has continued since February. Chrysler has some big holes in
its car lineup, and its new line of luxury cars haven't
caught on with consumers.

and a total 12,403 vehicles during the month. The numbers
