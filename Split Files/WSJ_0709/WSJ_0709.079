   SPRING HILL, Tenn. -- Richard G. "Skip" LeFauve, the top
man at General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary, is listening
to phrases that could describe his operation's brand-new
small car.
   "All-new aluminum engine, fail-safe sophisticated
marketing research and highly automated assembly technique .
. . a revolutionary change from a company and industry that
heretofore have stressed slow, evolutionary change."

   Mr. LeFauve smiles and nods. But the passage isn't about
Saturn at all. It's from J. Patrick Wright's 1979 best
seller, "On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors." It was
GM's billing for the Vega, its botched 1970 effort to build a
small car as cheap and as good as the imports.
   "I'll be darned]" Mr. LeFauve exclaims. Once over his
surprise, he adds: "We've had many letters from people
saying, `Don't let this be another Vega.'"
   It has been seven years and more than $3.5 billion since
GM Chairman Roger B. Smith first said Saturn would tackle the
very assignment Vega flunked: to prove that GM could build a
top-quality small car in the U.S. At a time when GM thought
that the "magic bullet" of technology would solve its
competitiveness problems, Mr. Smith promised a lot from
Saturn.
   The cars would shame the Japanese, he said. He predicted
that Saturn's high-tech wizardry and team-spirit culture
would inspire all American industry in its battle with Japan.
Alluding to the moon rockets that inspired Saturn's name, he
called it "a project of cosmic dimensions."
   But now, as Saturn is about to start building cars for its
long-awaited launch in late October, it clearly won't reach
many of Mr. Smith's ambitious goals.
   For starters, Saturn's cars won't offer a revolutionary
advance over the Japanese. "Two or three years ago, we would
have been well ahead of the competition," says Luther Coggin,
a Saturn dealer in Jacksonville, Fla. "By the time we hit the
market, we won't have a giant edge."
   And although Saturn's management, which stresses worker
involvement in decisions, certainly differs from GM's stodgy
corpocracy, labor-management barriers have been coming down
throughout the auto industry. Even within GM, cooperation
between members of the United Auto Workers union and
white-collar engineers and plant managers has significantly
improved quality and productivity at factories such as the
Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., and the truck plant in
Fort Wayne, Ind.
   As for beating the Japanese on cost, Saturn hasn't done it
yet. One big reason is the enormous expense of the new
Tennessee factory. For $1.9 billion, Saturn constructed one
of the most highly integrated car plants since Henry Ford
began building automobiles at his massive Rouge complex near
Detroit in 1927. Saturn's facility will be able to produce
about 240,000 cars -- and their engines and transmissions --
a year. But to be profitable over the long term, Thomas G.
Manoff, Saturn's vice president of finance, concedes, Saturn
will have to double that capacity.
   While Saturn was incubating, Honda Motor Co. spent about
$2 billion developing its own U.S. car-building operation.
The original Marysville, Ohio, plant started up in 1982 by
building an existing model, the Accord. Automation was
modest; some 35% of the welding was done manually. Honda
developed its facilities in stages, adding capacity as demand
required and more sophisticated automation as workers became
more adept at using it.
   Saturn, in contrast, started out trying to design a
facility so automated that much of it would run without human
workers. But Saturn abandoned much of that goal, partly
because other high-tech GM operations simply didn't work.
   Moreover, Honda, once it got started, moved faster. GM
took more than three years to decide that Saturn should have
its own plant and should locate it in Tennessee. Meanwhile,
Honda expanded the Marysville assembly plant and began
building its Ohio engine factory. Then, in 1985, it launched
an all-new Accord whose development had started before the
Saturn project was conceived.
   The result: For roughly what GM spent at Spring Hill,
Honda got not one but two assembly plants with total annual
capacity of 510,000 cars -- more than double Saturn's. Honda
also got a factory capable of building almost all the
engines, transmissions and related components needed by its
auto-assembly operations and its Ohio motorcycle plant.
   Thus the question: Does GM need an expensive new operation
to do what Honda does as a matter of course -- build
top-quality cars at competitive prices in the U.S.?
   Top GM officials say five years ago, the answer clearly
was yes. GM's traditional car divisions weren't reaching
import-oriented consumers, and the prospects of forging
cooperative agreements with the UAW looked dim. Saturn, with
its separate dealerships and radical -- for GM-labor
agreement was viewed as a crucial laboratory for concepts
that could reinvigorate the huge corporation.
   Privately, some GM officials concede that they have since
discovered that the company's traditional operations could
change on their own, albeit slowly. Not only has progress
been made on labor relations, but there are signs that
traditional GM marketing divisions can fight the Japanese.
Last fall, Chevrolet overhauled the marketing effort for its
stumbling Geo brand to woo Japanese car fans more
aggressively. The result: Geo sales since Oct. 1 are up 59%
from the year-earlier period. However, there's a catch. The
hot-selling Geo Storm coupe is made in Japan. But the
best-selling Geo is the Prizm, a sedan built in California by
union workers at a GM-Toyota joint-venture plant.
   Nevertheless, GM executives say the company needs Saturn.
"It's vital that we have a car marketed squarely to those
people who won't even come into our showrooms today," says
Robert C. Stempel, who is slated to succeed Mr. Smith as
chairman on Aug. 1. "That's where Saturn is positioned."
   That's also why Saturn may hold a private ceremony,
instead of a public party, for Mr. Smith to fulfill his
pledge to drive a car off its assembly line before he
retires. Saturn officials worried that television footage of
GM's chairman waving from the front seat would scare off the
very import buyers the subsidiary must attract.
   It isn't entirely Saturn's fault that it won't fulfill Mr.
Smith's promises. Some of his goals were wildly unrealistic
or simply not worth meeting.
   Mr. Smith wanted Saturn to be a totally computerized
"paperless" operation; Saturn people quickly learned this was
impossible. He wanted Saturn to build cheap, good-mileage
subcompacts. But since 1983, sales of cheap little cars have
dropped along with gasoline prices.
   Now, Saturn will offer cars about the size of a Toyota
Corolla. Base prices on Corollas range from just under $9,000
to just over $13,000. It isn't exactly clear how Saturn
prices will compare, but Saturn officials say they expect the
majority of their cars will sell from roughly $10,000 to
almost $13,000 after adding popular options such as air
conditioning and radios.
   As for the cars, dealers who have driven them praise their
peppy multivalve, four-cylinder engines, smooth
transmissions, appealing looks and good handling. The
interiors have such features as windshield-wiper and light
controls on easy-to-reach stalks on the steering column. Jay
Wetzel, vice president of engineering, calls the cars "sports
touring sedans and coupes."
   But all this describes nearly a dozen other competing
models, including the Honda Civic, Mazda MX6 Coupe, Toyota
Corolla and Corolla's twin, Chevy's Geo Prizm. In short,
Saturn is headed into a traffic jam, and many dealers say it
will have a hard time fulfilling its vow to grab 80% of its
sales from non-GM brands.
   That leaves a final goal: sparking revolution in GM's
hidebound corporate culture. It's far too early to judge
Saturn on this score. But a decade of like-minded efforts,
ranging from multibillion-dollar acquisitions to a sweeping
reorganization, shows that change comes slowly and painfully
at the world's largest corporation.
   Saturn officials say they routinely share information with
their GM peers. But some at GM view Saturn both as a tacit
rebuke to their competitiveness and as a rival for corporate
resources. And not without reason. The billions spent on
Saturn helped delay the launch of a new line of four-door
mid-sized cars that GM needed in the late 1980s to counter
Ford Motor Co.'s Taurus and Sable models. That delay
contributed to GM's plunge in U.S. market share from 44% in
1983 to 35.7% as of the end of June, and it cost the auto
maker billions.
   At least one GM official wanted to kill Saturn. Elmer W.
Johnson, an executive vice president, argued that Saturn
needlessly diverted resources at a time when GM was closing
plants and struggling to sell existing brands. He even voiced
his opposition to GM's directors. But Chairman Smith's pet
project survived, and Mr. Johnson chose to leave GM.
   Now, Saturn officials want to dump all the baggage heaped
on them by friends and foes. In less than four months, they
must crank up a new, highly complex factory to build an
all-new car for a network of showrooms still largely under
construction. Even Toyota Motor Corp., the industry's
quality-efficiency leader, avoids building new products in
new plants.
   Saturn is biting off even more complexity. It must
persuade car buyers already boggled by more than 600
different models to go out of their way to find a brand they
know nothing about. To ice the cake, Saturn is doing all this
in one of the weakest car markets since the early 1980s.
   The man in charge of all this, Mr. LeFauve, is a
soft-spoken 55-year-old whom co-workers regard as a genuinely
decent person and one of GM's quiet stars. A believer in
worker involvement long before it became fashionable in the
industry, he has been known to invite hourly employees as
well as executives to private parties.
   In his 34 years at GM, Mr. LeFauve has run several
manufacturing operations, including the Rochester Products
division, where he oversaw a cooperative effort among
workers, the University of Alabama and GM management in 1983
to cut $2 million out of costs and save a carburetor plant in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.
   Mr. LeFauve has thrown himself -- and even his
leisure-time reading -- into his latest challenge. He was
especially intrigued by C. Gayle Warnock's "The Edsel
Affair," an insider's history of Ford's disastrous effort to
launch an all-new division and car in the late 1950s. The
people "responsible for Edsel had no control over actual
production," so quality "suffered," Mr. LeFauve says he
learned. "There's where Saturn is strikingly different."
   Saturn is also strikingly different in the
almost-religious fervor displayed by Mr. LeFauve and his
3,300 or so co-workers, some 1,600 of whom are union workers.
   These people accepted a union agreement without job
classifications or myriad work rules. They also waived all
UAW seniority rights to return to their old plants. GM
salaried workers who joined Saturn didn't have to make that
sacrifice. But both UAW and salaried employees will be paid
at least 20% less than their regular GM counterparts -- with
the proviso that they can make up the difference and more if
Saturn meets certain goals.
   In exchange for the sacrifices, Saturn employees also have
unprecedented involvement in all of the subsidiary's
operations. For example, Saturn's union workers, like those
at many U.S. auto plants, help develop factory processes. But
they also are members of the teams that helped pick dealers,
the advertising agency and even the paving material for
parking lots (a concrete mixture was chosen over asphalt,
which cost more). And workers in each group interview and
hire co-workers; Saturn doesn't have a traditional personnel
department. Its extensive, continuous training program mixes
such esoterica as "Principle-Centered Leadership" with more
traditional fare, "Paint Ovens Overview."
   Employees say all this is crucial to their mission:
building not just a car but "systems that will make the
customer feel very loved, if you will, by the vehicle," says
James Bovenzi, a finance manager. But Saturn's gung-ho
approach to people is reminiscent of GM's initially
enthusiastic, later scaled-back embrace of robots. UAW
officials caution that the Saturn system probably won't work
elsewhere.
   Saturn's best chance of producing true innovations for GM
may lie in its dealership and distribution network. It's an
area where change is next to impossible in existing
operations because state franchise laws strongly protect the
status quo. Saturn handpicked dealers whose operations scored
high in customer-satisfaction surveys and whose pockets were
deep enough to build up to $2 million in new facilities.
Saturn gave the dealers exclusive territories, many of them
more than triple the size of a normal Big Three franchise.
   Russell Hand, for instance, will be the only Saturn dealer
in the sprawling Culver City-Inglewood-Torrance area south
and west of Los Angeles. The wide territory may provide
enough sales volume to offset the relatively low per-car
profit inherent in cars selling for less than $13,000.
   But because of the exclusive territories, Saturn shoppers
might not see the discounting common in other dealerships
because, as Mr. Hand puts it, he won't have to "waste time
and energy trying to steal sales from the Saturn dealer three
blocks away." Saturn officials insist that they won't offer
cash rebates.
   In return for the huge franchises, Saturn is asking
dealers to give their facilities a uniform look, with sales
offices and service bays side-by-side in the front. They also
insist that dealer personnel be trained in
customer-satisfaction techniques.
   The trouble is, for much of Saturn's first year, many
Americans won't be able to find a Saturn dealer at all. To
match its gradual production phase-in, Saturn plans a
region-by-region launch, starting in the West and Southeast.
Even after 12 months, Saturn expects to have only about 110
sales outlets nationwide -- a smaller number than Jaguar,
which sells fewer than 20,000 cars a year in the U.S.
   Saturn also will have trouble outdoing rival auto makers'
promises of unparalleled buyer satisfaction. Every month, it
seems, yet-another brand announces free roadside service,
generous leases, even free maintenance. GM's Oldsmobile
division last fall gave customers who didn't like their new
Olds after 30 days the option of trading it in for full
credit toward a different Olds model. Oldsmobile's sales
nonetheless continued to slide.
   To set itself apart, Saturn is counting on something
hardly revolutionary: advertising. It has a $100 million
marketing budget. And it has hired Hal Riney &amp; Partners, a
small San Francisco agency known not for car advertising but
for lump-in-the-throat paeans to American values.
   Dealers say the early versions of the launch ads follow
the tone of a 22 1/2-minute video, made largely for internal
use, that juxtaposes soft-focus images of Tennessee farmers,
newborn calves and hackberry trees with shots of the huge
factory and silhouettes of the car. "It's spring, in Spring
Hill, Tennessee," Mr. Riney says, in the same distinctive,
gruff baritone and cadence he used to say "it's morning in
America" for his most famous client, Ronald Reagan. The
symbolism is similar, too: Saturn promises a rebirth of the
American car just as Mr. Reagan promised a new day in
American politics.
   But, given the odds against them, Saturn officials are
trying to reduce expectations. "Judge us on quality right
away," Saturn's Mr. Wetzel says. "Judge us on market share in
five years."
   By that time, GM and Saturn may have a better answer for
the question that has dogged the project almost from the
start: Was this really necessary? In the meantime, Saturn's
people are working and worrying with almost equal ardor.
   "We're real, real determined," says Laurie Danko, a
continuing-education coordinator who has been with Saturn
from the start. "We want this to work real bad." But, she
adds, the project also "scares the hell out of us. My husband
works here, too. We have all our eggs in this basket."
