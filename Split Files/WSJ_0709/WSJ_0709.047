   LONDON -- Ralph M. Ingersoll II, after agreeing to
relinquish his highly leveraged U.S. newspaper empire last
week, has pinned all his hopes on Europe.
   But the American publisher is far from realizing his
ambitious dream of a European regional newspaper network. In
fact, the few holdings amassed so far in Britain and Ireland
are causing him bigger and costlier headaches than
anticipated. Mr. Ingersoll owns several daily and weekly
papers in Birmingham and Coventry, England, and holds a 50%
stake in Irish Press Newspapers Ltd., publisher of two
dailies and a Sunday paper.

   Late Friday, the Irish Press said the three papers will
cease publication July 23. Its half-dozen unions have balked
at a management proposal to axe 240 of more than 700 jobs.
Union officials hope to reach a compromise in the next two
weeks but "there is a growing fear" that the papers will in
fact close, one union negotiator said yesterday.
   "Expectations were quite high when he came in" to Britain
in 1987, recalled Fiona Cooper, an associate director in
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte's communications division in
London. "At the moment, I don't see Ingersoll as a major
player in the regional newspaper industry in the U.K.," she
added. "He just has not had any impact at all."
   Mr. Ingersoll was in London Friday, but unavailable for
comment, an aide said.
   Because of his limited success so far in Britain, some
newspaper-business watchers doubt Mr. Ingersoll's claim that
his Ingersoll Publications Ltd. unit has equity valued at
between $200 million and $300 million. The figure "could be
fantasy," said Craig Fitt, media analyst at Moody's Investors
Service Inc., which withdrew its debt rating last February on
a large part of U.S.-based Ingersoll Publications Co.
"There's no way of knowing with that company," Mr. Fitt
asserted.
   Last week, the U.S. parent announced that E.M. Warburg
Pincus &amp; Co. will acquire all of Mr. Ingersoll's stock in his
three U.S. companies, which publish metropolitan daily
newspapers. Mr. Ingersoll, in turn, is acquiring Warburg's
50% stake in London-based Ingersoll Publications Ltd. The
unit has annual revenue of $178 million, cash flow of $40
million and bank debt of $109 million, according to
Ingersoll.
   Those revenue and cash flow numbers seem high to some
industry experts because Ingersoll Publications Ltd. reported
after-tax profit of #1,940,000 ($3,458,000) on revenue of #58
million for 1988, the latest figures available from U.K.
authorities. "It leaves one feeling a little puzzled," said
Eric de Bellaigue, a publishing analyst at London broker
Panmure Gordon. He said that most regional U.K. newspaper
chains sell for a multiple of about 10 times earnings. Based
on the 1988 figures -- which exclude Ingersoll's subsequent
and undisclosed investment in Irish Press -- "you're looking
at a market capitalization of about #20 million," he said.
   It's also debatable whether the fortunes of Ingersoll
Publications Ltd. have improved much since 1988. The British
newspaper industry has been hit hard by an advertising slump
in recent months, compounding Mr. Ingersoll's difficulties in
digesting his #62.5 million acquisition of the Birmingham
Post and Mail newspaper group.
   Readership of the Birmingham Evening Mail in the Midlands
area, England's industrial heartland, fell about 10.6% to
521,000 last year from 583,000 the prior year, according to
one leading industry survey. Mr. Ingersoll launched 28
different editions of free weekly papers for Birmingham
suburbs last year but, rivals say, scant advertising forced
him to cut the number to eight. Competitors also claim he has
shelved ambitious plans to build a new printing plant for the
Birmingham papers, and instead is installing new presses. He
also apparently intends to relaunch the Post, a morning
tabloid with an estimated 29,000 daily circulation, in
broadsheet form this fall.
   "I haven't seen any significant changes" in the
competitive climate since Mr. Ingersoll entered the U.K.
market, said Roger Rix, chief executive officer of Reed
Midland Newspapers, a unit of British publishing giant Reed
International PLC, whose papers include the Birmingham Daily
News. The free paper publishes 276,000 copies four times a
week. "Given the publicity (about Mr. Ingersoll), I was
expecting to see a quantum leap in input and in ideas," Mr.
Rix went on, "There was a feeling that there were a number of
lessons that could be transferred from the American market."
   Mr. Ingersoll has said that he wants to start new
publishing ventures, primarily daily and weekly newspapers,
in Europe. His primary interests are Sweden and, in
particular, Germany. While conceding that there is plenty of
competition from German publishers, he said he believes
German readers are better educated and more interested in the
printed word than their American counterparts, and thus would
welcome new publications. Last week, at the time of the split
with Warburg, he said he also is interested in entering
magazine publishing in Europe.
   To finance the expansion, Mr. Ingersoll has said he will
turn to European banks and investors, who he believes will
welcome the opportunity to invest with him.
   But with his hands full managing his British and Irish
newspaper investments, Mr. Ingersoll may be unable to expand
his European empire quickly, some analysts believe. "He may
not have the resources or standing to do that for a little
while," said Panmure Gordon's Mr. de Bellaigue.
