   E.M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Co., the new owner of the newspaper
empire that belonged to Ralph Ingersoll II, isn't considering
the sale of any papers, though it faces potentially drawn-out
negotiations over debt payments to bondholders.
   Warburg severed its seven-year partnership with Ingersoll
Publications Co. last Monday, agreeing to acquire all of Mr.
Ingersoll's stock in his three U.S. newspaper companies,
while handing over control of British and Irish properties to
Mr. Ingersoll.

   Robert Jelenic, who had been No. 2 as Ingersoll
Publications' president, was quickly made chief executive
officer and is already planning changes. Mr. Jelenic said he
will rename the company as early as this week and will move
the company headquarters as of Nov. 1 from Princeton, N.J.,
to Trenton, N.J., where Ingersoll publishes the Trentonian.
   Warburg, a New York-based investment banking firm, will
control companies whose daily newspapers are concentrated in
Northeastern states, where an economic slowdown has battered
newspaper profit margins. The companies include Ingersoll
Newspapers Inc., which also publishes the weekly Suburban
Journals in St. Louis; New Haven Acquisition Co., publisher
of the New Haven Register; and Community Newspapers Inc.,
which publishes papers in Ohio and New York and faces a
possible default on interest payments to bondholders.
   The new owners said they will work out any problems with
bondholders and seek to bolster the companies with new cash
investments. Lionel Pincus, chairman of Warburg, said they
would "improve and expand the operations of Ingersoll
Newspapers Inc. and New Haven" and that Warburg has equity
capital of more than $3 billion to work with.
   "Since the acquisition, I've had plenty of calls from
people wanting to buy our papers," said Mr. Jelenic. "That's
natural in this situation, but nothing's for sale. Warburg
wants to grow the properties."
   Warburg has a thorny financial problem with the payment of
debt on Community Newspapers. CNI didn't make the semiannual
interest payment due July 1 on the $125 million of 13% senior
subordinated reset notes, and didn't meet the July 7 deadline
to reset interest rates on those bonds.
   CNI is working under a 30-day grace period in which to
work out payment arrangements, or otherwise be considered in
default. After that, CNI could be pushed into bankruptcy law
proceedings by bondholders.
   Bondholders aren't expected to go that far. One
bondholder, who asked not to be identified, said: "Bankruptcy
is the ultimate threat, but we would like to avoid it.
Bankruptcy is expensive and very slow."
   A steering committee representing CNI bondholders has
worked with financial adviser, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. and legal adviser, Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, to place sale
values on Ingersoll properties in the case of liquidation.
While it's not clear what alternatives the bondholders group
has offered CNI's management, two possibilities include
lowering the interest on the bonds in exchange for equity, or
increasing the dollar value of a tender offer to holders of
CNI's junk bonds.
   Warburg Pincus's decision to miss the interest payment
rankled some bondholders, but other believe it gives them
even more leverage to force a solution. "I am not happy they
didn't meet my interest payment but it gives us leverage to
pick it apart if it comes down to it," said a bondholder.
   But bond analysts doubt Warburg will ever let CNI fall
into bankruptcy. Analysts expect Warburg to make the interest
payment, estimated to be $8.1 million, just before the 30-day
period runs out in an attempt to keep negotiations alive.
Should CNI fall into bankruptcy proceedings, analysts said,
it would largely wipe out the value of Warburg's equity in
the company.
   In general, bondholders are happy the newspapers have new
ownership. "We are generally happy that Ralph {Ingersoll} is
out of the picture," said one bondholder. "There is no given
that Warburg will do better by us than Ralph did, but Warburg
has deeper pockets and Ralph has zip."
