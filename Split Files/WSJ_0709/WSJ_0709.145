   NEW YORK -- If they can't deliver the public, at least
they can deliver their employees.
   The public relations gurus at Burson-Marsteller, trying to
restore some of the fizz Perrier lost in the benzene
contamination crisis, haven't met with unqualified success
since the brand's re-entry into the U.S. market two months
ago. A number of restaurants, which accounted for a big chunk
of the brand's sales, have refused to put Perrier back on
their menus, and their patrons aren't complaining.

   Now, Burson-Marsteller officials are taking matters into
their employees' hands. In an internal memo distributed late
last week, Tom Mosser, president of Burson's U.S. operations,
directed the firm's 1,500 staffers to "help Perrier regain
its prominence" by "expressing disappointment" when
patronizing watering holes that shun the brand. Employees
have been instructed to grill restaurateurs who don't offer
the once-chichi import and to forward their explanations to a
Burson executive in New York.
   Some rival PR honchos swear they would never resort to
such a technique. "Usually you try to reach out to the public
to create the demand," says Howard J. Rubenstein, president
of Howard J. Rubenstein Associates in New York. "You don't go
out and ask your employees to create it."
   Richard Edelman, president of Edelman Public Relations
Worldwide, says Burson is resorting to "desperation tactics."
He adds: "That's not conducive to employee morale, nor
frankly is it going to be useful in raising sales. . . .
People resent this kind of thing."
   Burson officials counter that the appeal is nothing out of
the ordinary. "To characterize this as desperate is totally
nonsense," says James E. Murphy, vice chairman at Burson, a
unit of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. "We customarily endorse all of
our clients' products. It's not unusual for us to encourage
our employees to use them."
   Perrier, meanwhile, insists that the brand is going
gangbusters and that retail sales are strong. And despite
reports that some Perrier executives are unhappy with the
price of Burson's PR balm, the watermen publicly gush with
gratitude.
   Kim Jeffery, Perrier's senior vice president of marketing,
characterizes Burson's hands-on approach as "very nice." His
verdict: "I think they're very, very good."
