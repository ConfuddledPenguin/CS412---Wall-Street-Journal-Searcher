   HOUSTON -- President Bush today will urge leaders of the
major Western nations -- and the European Community in
particular -- to commit themselves to fundamental reforms in
agriculture to ensure success in the current round of global
trade-liberalization talks, U.S. officials said.
   The president's comments will ensure a contentious first
day at the three-day annual economic summit meeting of the
seven Western industrialized nations: the U.S., Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. European
Community leaders also attend annual economic summits.

   As Western leaders gathered here over the weekend, Mr.
Bush held bilateral meetings with Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who
both stand close to the U.S. on some of the major issues
under consideration at the summit.
   Japan's Mr. Kaifu, for example, joined President Bush in
committing "full energy to securing the benefits of an open
world trading system through successful completion of the
current Uruguay round this year."
   These talks under the world trade treaty -- the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- began in Uruguay in 1986
and are to be completed this December. They are currently
bogged down because of disagreement over farm subsidies. The
battle pits major agricultural exporters like the U.S.,
Australia and Chile on one side, which favors sharp cuts and
the eventual elimination of farm subsidies, against the
European Community, which argues that it can't do away with
such subsidies without severely damaging its social fabric.
   The Japanese also -- along with the U.S. -- are resisting
German and French calls for rapid aid of as much as $15
billion for the ailing Soviet economy.
   Japan, however, is likely soon to resume lending to China
several billion dollars that has been held back since the
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in June
1989, Mr. Kaifu told Mr. Bush at their meeting. The U.S.
doesn't oppose this move. "The president understands Japan's
wish to restart lending," Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
told reporters Saturday. "We understand countries can have
different points of view at different points in time."
   Canada's Mr. Mulroney, meantime, is backing the U.S. to
the hilt on the need to slash agricultural subsidies. Both
Japan and Canada have good reasons of their own for
supporting the U.S. on the trade and Soviet issues. Japan has
yet to resolve outstanding bilateral issues with the Soviet
Union, such as four small north Pacific islands under the
Soviets' control since 1945. "It's a legacy of Stalinist
expansionism," a senior Japanese official here remarked.
Until such problems are addressed, Japan opposes direct aid
to the Soviet Union.
   Canada, like the U.S., has a more efficient agriculture
than the European Community, and thus has less to fear from
doing away with agricultural subsidies.
   In addition, Britian's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
who met with President Bush last week in London, strongly
backs U.S. opposition to aid to the Soviets. She argues that
such funds would probably be wasted.
   For their part, the Europeans question the intense
pressure the U.S. is putting on agriculture, and don't want
to go into nearly as much detail on the issue. "I'm not sure
it's wise to build up all this pressure, I'm not sure it's
the best climate for negotiations," Frans Andriessen, the
EC's vice president for external relations, said in an
interview Saturday. "It's not the task of the leaders to get
into detail," he added, arguing that the talks now being held
in Geneva at the GATT are the correct place to thrash out the
agricultural issue.
   Trade and agricultural matters are likely to be discussed
before the full summit's opening session this afternoon, as
President Bush holds separate bilateral meetings with West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois
Mitterrand. Mr. Bush met with EC Commission President Jacques
Delors yesterday.
   Judging by the remarks of Mr. Andriessen and other EC
officials, the Europeans intend to try to impress on the
Houston gathering that their agriculture is different. "The
very structure of agriculture in Europe is completely
different to the U.S. and Canada. It's a small-scale
agriculture with 10 million to 12 million farmers in the EC,
compared with two million to three million in the U.S.," Mr.
Andriessen said. "The average acreage per farm {in North
America} is four times the average in the EC," and in social,
political and human terms, Europe can't allow this farming
community to disappear, Mr. Andriessen said.
   The Europeans also stress that there are other areas of
the GATT negotiations -- such as textiles and procedures for
settling trade disputes -- that also are stymied.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Andriessen, who is effectively the
community's senior trade official, said there's a growing
consensus in Europe that agriculture and success in the
Uruguay Round are linked, and he conceded that without
progress on the farm-trade issue, the GATT talks could be
threatened.
   He says he would like to see the Uruguay Round get a boost
from the summit, but indicates that a recent paper produced
by the GATT agricultural negotiation group in Geneva could be
a starting point for an agricultural compromise between the
major food exporters and the Europeans. "I think there are
many elements that deserve careful consideration, and
possibly to be discussed," Mr. Andriessen said of the paper.
   The overall thrust of that paper was welcomed by a meeting
of trade ministers of 14 major agricultural exporting
countries. But the so-called Cairns Group, which consists
mostly of developing countries, also issued a communique last
Friday expressing "deep concern at the slow progress in
agricultural negotiations" and warned of "the danger of a
crisis." They appealed to participants at the Houston summit
"to ensure that the Uruguay round and especially agriculture
is given top priority."
   Meanwhile, Secretary Brady told reporters that in his
bilateral meeting with Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, the Japanese official had shown "support" for Mr.
Bush's new economic initiative on Latin America. Japan
appears likely to contribute to the investment fund that the
U.S. wants to see at the InterAmerican Development Bank, Mr.
Brady said. Mr. Bush has pledged the U.S. to contribute $100
million a year over the next five years, and proposed that
the fund receive as much as $300 million a year, including
contributions from Japan and Europe.
