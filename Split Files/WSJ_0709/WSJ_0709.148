   The currency union in Germany worked well last week, but
was marred when some stores charged East Germans exorbitant
prices for food and other basics. Some reports attributed the
price-gouging to capitalist greed, but the East German
government discovered the real problem. The two state-run
grocery chains set up by the communists had suddenly become
unregulated state monopolies and could charge what they
wanted. Last Friday, the East Germans began allowing local
governments to sell the stores to private buyers. By selling
the stores to different investors this instant privatization
should drive prices down quickly.
