   MILAN -- After having outpaced its European counterparts
in the first half, the Milan stock market is likely to see
its advance slowed in the third quarter, analysts say.
   Although sentiment hasn't turned sour, the mood is already
a bit lethargic, and buying interest will become increasingly
selective, analysts predict. The market's leading industrials
are expected to lag behind the market, while
telecommunications, cement, food and selected textile stocks
will still be attractive, they added.

   Analysts predict the general MIB index will maintain
itself above 1060 through the July-September period. This
would be 6% above its level at the beginning of the year, but
down about four percentage points from its 1990 high of 1113
reached on June 14. The MIB closed at 1065 Friday after a
weak session.
   The strong inflow of foreign buying that lifted the index
during May and June could be diverted to other European
markets over the summer as international investors look for
greener pastures, the analysts said.
   "International money follows performance, and we may see
it shifting from Italy to France, which has been quiet
lately, or back to Germany if the market perceives a unified
German market will pose no threat to inflation," said Albert
Alonzo, Italian market analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
London.
   A major factor spooking foreign buyers recently is the
sudden escalation of labor unrest just as Italy takes on its
role as president of the European Community. Government
attempts to head off a general strike by Italy's three
leading unions set for Wednesday have been unsuccessful so
far. The conflict is expected to test a delicate political
balance in Italy's governing coalition headed by veteran
Christian Democrat Giulio Andreotti.
   "We're going to see relatively slower progress over the
third quarter largely because the conflict between
Confindustria (Italy's manufacturers' association) and the
unions will probably not be resolved until the end of the
quarter at the earliest," Mr. Alonzo said.
   Confindustria wants to abolish the "scala mobile"
automatic wage index by next year and is urging that wage
increases be linked to performance instead of the current
"escalator," which is tied to inflation.
   Until the social tensions are resolved, the cost of labor
remains a wild card in Italy's macroeconomic picture, with
major implications for inflation and interest rates. Although
inflation is on a downtrend, "it still hasn't been beaten,"
Mr. Alonzo asserted.
   Italy's cost of living rose 5.6% in June from a year
earlier, down from 5.7% in May, and the Bank of Italy
predicted last week that it will fall to around 5% by the end
of the year if wage costs can be kept under control.
   Mutual funds are heavily invested in blue chips Fiat and
Generali, two shares that drive the Milan market. Together,
they represent some 20% of the Milan market's total
capitalization.
   Analysts said the telecommunications sector is still
hitting strong notes and shows little sign of abating.
   "There's nothing to cloud the horizon" on
telecommunications shares, said Suzanne Miller, sector
analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. "You keep
expecting some sort of short-term consolidation, but it never
materializes."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Tokyo stocks finished higher on thin volume Friday, with
interest flocking instead to the secondary markets,
particularly the Tokyo Stock Exchange Second Section.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 93.45
points at 32445.12. The index lost 94.25 points Thursday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index fell
2.56 points to 32442.56.
   Friday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 450
million shares, off slightly from 473 million Thursday.
   Winning issues outnumbered losing issues, 512 to 438,
while 174 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which dropped 1.31 points Thursday,
added 2.16 points, or 0.09%, to 2364.20.
   The Second Section index, which advanced 30.96 points
Thursday, soared 69.23 points, or 1.63%, to close at 4323.03.
Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 48.6 million
shares, compared with Thursday's 31.4 million.
   Electrical parts shares were strong advancers, helped by
local news reports that the industry remains healthy. Hirose
Electric soared 250 yen ($1.66) to 7,350 yen, and Yokogawa
Electric rose 20 to 1,630.
   Among blue-chip winners were Kyocera, up 110 to 8,970, and
Sony, up 60 to 8,800.
   London share prices closed on their intraday highs Friday,
buoyed by a firm performance on Wall Street and a broad-based
program trade by an unidentified securities firm.
   Sentiment remains nervous on the almost daily release of
profit downgradings and Thursday's comment by the U.K.
Chancellor of the Exchequer that interest rates would have to
remain high because of the excessive amount of credit in the
economy.
   Friday, the end of the current two-week trading account,
saw brisk volume, with 739.8 million shares traded compared
with 386.8 million Thursday. Dealers ascribed the hefty
volume in part to a share trade in Cable &amp; Wireless. Dealers
reported that 50 million shares were traded, but this
couldn't be confirmed.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 8.6 points at 2340.
   The narrower FT-SE 30-index ended up 6.8 points at 1865.0,
while the September FT-SE 100 futures index closed at 2412.0,
up 19 points.
   Shares gaining Friday included the banks, which continue
to receive favorable comment after being downgraded on debt
worries. Analysts reckon that all the bad news is now
factored into the prices.
   Midland gained 6 pence (seven cents) to 397, Lloyds was up
12 pence at 299, Barclays gained 7 to 398 and National
Westminster was up 7 at 329.
   Shares losing ground included Rank Organisation, which
shed 8 to close at 833, and Hawker Siddeley, which lost 6 to
610.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt, Zurich
and Brussels, lower in Stockholm and Madrid, were mixed in
Amsterdam and were little changed in Paris. South African
gold stocks closed marginally higher.
   Share prices closed higher in Taipei and Manila, mixed in
Hong Kong, Singapore and Wellington, lower in Seoul and
little changed in Sydney.
