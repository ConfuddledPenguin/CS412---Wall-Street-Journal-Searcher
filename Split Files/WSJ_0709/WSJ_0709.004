   PITTSBURGH -- H.J. Heinz Co. said its directors voted to
exclude the food company from all provisions of
Pennsylvania's new anti-takeover law.
   The legislation, signed into law April 27, allows publicly
owned concerns incorporated in the state to exclude
themselves from all or part of its anti-takeover provisions
within 90 days of passage.
