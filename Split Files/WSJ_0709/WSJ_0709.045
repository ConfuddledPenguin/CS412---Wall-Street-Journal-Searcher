   BUENOS AIRES -- A consortium led by Spain's Iberia Air
Lines made the only offer for the Argentine government-owned
airline Aerolineas Argentinas when bids were submitted
Friday.
   Terms weren't disclosed, and the government reserved the
right to reject the offer. A ruling was expected this week.

   An 85% share of Aerolineas is for sale for $236 million,
plus $1.5 billion of the airline's debt paper.
   The Iberia group's offer was made in conjunction with
local businessmen who own the small Argentine airline Austral
and the First Boston Corp. investment banking unit of CS
First Boston Inc.
   The Italian carrier Alitalia, Varig Brazilian Airlines and
Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., parent of American
Airlines, all had expressed interest in the sale but didn't
submit bids.
   The Aerolineas sale is part of the Argentine government's
plan to restructure the country's economy by reducing the
role of the state. Last month, the sale of 60% of the state
telephone company was granted to Telefonica S.A. of Spain and
Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia.
