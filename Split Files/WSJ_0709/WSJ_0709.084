   Economist Milton Friedman once described a paradox of
democracy, which he called "the law of the few." It's a
phenomenon by which a special-interest group shrinks in size
but grows in political clout. For example, government
subsidies to farmers that were unthinkable when agriculture
was a big part of the economy become possible when farmers
are few. This law now threatens to undermine the free-trading
system that has served the West so well for 40 years.
   The problem is a crazy-house of farm subsidies and trade
barriers, especially in the European Community. The U.S.,
backed by Australia, Canada and most everyone else, wants to
put world agriculture trade on a more sensible, free-market
footing. The EC countries, especially France and Germany, are
resisting. If progress isn't made at this week's Houston
summit of industrial nations, the issue could scuttle the
Uruguay Round of trade-opening talks that is supposed to end
this year.

   This truly is a case of the many held hostage by the few.
By one measure, farming accounted for only 2.7% of the
European economy in 1987 but last year cost EC consumers and
taxpayers some $93 billion in subsidy. The result is lakes of
wine, mountains of cheese and other European delights.
Jacques Delors, the EC president who may be the world's last
socialist, nonetheless intends to explain in Houston that
this can't be changed because European farming is somehow
different. If he means economically bizarre, he's right.
   The U.S. is also a sinner, to be sure, with subsidies,
quotas and "marketing orders" of its own. The U.S.
Agriculture Department figures farm subsidy and protection
cost Americans some $38 billion in 1986, or $681 for every
non-farm household. But at least the U.S. wants to point the
world in a more rational direction. Clayton Yeutter, the U.S.
Agriculture Secretary, has estimated that the nominal rate of
global protection on farm goods has doubled to 40% from the
mid-1960s. At the same time, tariffs on industrial goods have
fallen to less than 6% from 40%.
   Something's got to give, and the Aussie-U.S. proposals
aren't even all that radical. Beginning next year, the U.S.
wants to convert all non-tariff farm barriers -- quotas,
licenses and the like -- into tariffs, and then start
lowering tariff rates. This is the same pattern followed for
industrial goods since World War II. Second, the U.S. wants
to phase out all export subsidies and bans -- in other words,
to let farmers everywhere play by the same rules. Europe can
even keep its farmers on the dole, so long as its subsidies
stop distorting international trade.
   These reforms would be especially helpful for the Third
World, where agriculture remains the major employer. But the
U.S. and other industrial countries also consider them a
prerequisite to making progress on other trade issues.
Failure, said Mr. Yeutter recently, "would likely trigger an
escalation of restrictive trade actions and counter-actions
-- in short, an agricultural trade war nobody wants, and
nobody wins."
   This food fight is also something of a test case of
European economic unity. As Europe becomes one market in
1992, it has to decide if it's going to pick trade fights
with everyone else. If Europe wants to establish a new world
of trading "blocs," protectionists elsewhere will no doubt
oblige them. Then European consumers will pay most of all.
