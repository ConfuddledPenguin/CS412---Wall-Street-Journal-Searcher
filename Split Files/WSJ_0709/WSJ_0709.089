   HOUSTON -- Leaders of the U.S. and Canada agreed to begin
negotiations on a treaty to reduce acid-rain emissions.
   The discussions will begin July 16 in Ottawa, said Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney and President Bush in a joint
appearance following a brief meeting. President Bush said he
decided to go ahead with the talks even though Congress has
yet to pass a comprehensive Clean Air Act.

   The measure has passed both houses of Congress, and
discussions to resolve differences between the two versions
begin next week. Both versions include specific provisions
for sulfur-dioxide emissions, which produce acid rain. In the
past, the reluctance of the U.S. to enter into such
discussions has been a sticking point in the generally warm
relations between the U.S. and Canada.
   The treaty could include specific timetables for reducing
acid-rain emissions, details for a joint research and
monitoring program and provisions for settling disputes.
   Although the two leaders, meeting before the start of the
economic summit of industrial nations, emphasized the
progress in resolving environmental issues, their talks came
amid lingering disagreement among the summit partners over
environmental issues.
   A draft copy of the environmental portion of the summit
communique obtained by this newspaper shows that more than
one-third of the document remains in dispute, with pre-summit
negotiators unable to decide on such issues as whether global
climate change is the most important environmental issue
facing humanity, or only one of several environmental
priorities.
   Summit leaders are also expected to discuss the importance
of preserving forest land and helping underdeveloped nations
protect their environments while promoting economic
development. But they disagree on how extensive this
assistance should be.
