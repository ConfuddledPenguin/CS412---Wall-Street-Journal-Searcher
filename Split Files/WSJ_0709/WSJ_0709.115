   ATLANTA -- The first comprehensive study of injuries among
children shows that more than 22,000 youths die each year
from injuries, with homicides and suicides accounting for
one-fifth of the fatalities.
   The report, produced for Congress by the Centers for
Disease Control, estimates that the direct and indirect cost
of those injuries -- the leading cause of death among
children -- exceeds $8 billion.

   Both the number of fatalities and the cost to society
could be significantly reduced, the study suggests, if
schools, local governments and families placed added emphasis
on injury prevention.
   "Many people think of accidents as random and
unpredictable and, therefore, as unpreventable," said Juan G.
Rodriguez, a physician and specialist on injuries at the CDC.
"But they can be controlled; they can be prevented."
   Researchers found that in 1986, the most recent year for
which figures are available, 22,411 children age 19 and
younger died from the five leading causes of injuries:
motor-vehicle accidents, homicide, suicide, drowning and
burns.
   The rate of deaths (the number per 100,000 population)
linked to injuries actually fell 22% between 1968 and 1986,
the study shows, partly because of improvements in auto
safety and other preventive measures. Over the same period,
however, the death rate due to disease dropped more than 50%.
   "The efforts, the money and the research have gone into
diseases, but injuries haven't received that kind of
attention," Dr. Rodriguez said. "With the same type of
effort, we could decrease the impact of injuries on
children."
   Almost half of the injury-related fatalities in 1986
stemmed from auto accidents. Of those 10,500 deaths, between
15% and 30%, according to the CDC, were linked to alcohol
use.
   Homicide, the second-largest category among fatal
injuries, accounted for nearly 13% of the childhood deaths.
While the majority of these fatalities occurred among youths
age 15 to 19, almost one-quarter -- 660 homicides -- involved
children under the age of five.
   The third-leading cause of fatal injuries was suicide,
accounting for 2,151 deaths in 1986. Among children age 10 to
19, males accounted for 80% of the suicides. Of those, an
estimated 60% involved firearms. Drowning, burns and other
miscellaneous categories accounted for almost 7,000 deaths.
   About 20% of all hospitalizations among U.S. children stem
from injuries, including nearly 16 million emergency-room
visits. In all, more than 30,000 children each year are
permanently disabled because of their injuries.
   That toll, the report suggests, could be cut by, among
other actions, increased use of air bags in autos, reduced
access to firearms, and improved identification and referrals
of individuals at high risk for suicide.
