   MADRID -- Spanish truck maker Empresa Nacional de
Autocamiones S.A., or Enasa, looks increasingly like it will
have to seek an alternative to plans for its linkup with MAN
AG and Daimler-Benz AG.
   Though Spanish officials insist that they still hope to go
ahead with the plan to sell 80% of Enasa to the two West
German companies, the likelihood that MAN will withdraw from
the plan appears to be increasing.

   The European Community Commission and the West German
cartel office have opposed the accord on the grounds that it
infringes competition rules.
   MAN, meanwhile, appears to have decided that the
transaction is less attractive than it thought, because of
new business opportunities in Eastern Europe.
   If MAN does pull out, Spanish Industry Minister Claudio
Aranzadi said, Daimler will seek a new partner to join it in
taking over the Spanish truck maker.
   For its part, Mr. Aranzadi said, the Spanish government
won't go ahead with plans to purchase 8% of MAN's shares.
   Terms of the original agreement signed with the two West
German companies in December valued Enasa at 36 billion
pesetas ($356 million); MAN and Daimler were to take 60% and
20% of Enasa, respectively.
   Since the agreement, however, the uncertainty surrounding
Enasa's future has caused its sales to fall, while MAN's
shares have risen sharply.
