   Ingersoll-Rand Co., Woodcliff Lake, N.J., is considering
the possible sale of its Schlage Electronics Inc. unit, a
maker of security systems.
   A spokesman for Ingersoll-Rand, which also makes products
including equipment for road construction and well and rock
drilling, was unable to provide annual sales for Schlage,
Santa Clara, Calif.

   The company retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to
evaluate alternatives for Schlage. Ingersoll-Rand's spokesman
couldn't say why Ingersoll-Rand took that step for the
security-systems unit, which is profitable. But he did say
the business is a smaller part of the locks unit of the
parent's bearings, locks and tools segment. Schlage has 300
employees. The parent had 31,600 employees at the end of
1989.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Ingersoll-Rand shares closed at $58.125, up 37.5 cents.
