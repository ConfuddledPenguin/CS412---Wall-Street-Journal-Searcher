   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange censured American
Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and fined it a
record $500,000 for Shearson's trading of E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
stock during 1986 takeover talks.
   Shearson, without admitting or denying the allegations,
consented to the exchange's findings that it violated Big
Board rules in its purchases and sales of Hutton stock
between August and October 1986, while Shearson was making an
unsuccessful effort to acquire Hutton. About a year after
that aborted effort to acquire Hutton, Shearson succeeded in
buying the firm for nearly $1 billion.

   A separate Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation of the matter has been dropped, people familiar
with the case said. The SEC declined to comment.
   The Big Board's investigation involved Shearson's purchase
of Hutton stock before the two firms began exploratory talks
on a merger in late September and October 1986. By Sept. 19,
according to the Big Board, Shearson had bought about 1.5
million shares, or 4.9%, of Hutton's common, just under the
5% level that requires public disclosure.
   Shearson sold about a third of its Hutton holdings Oct.
15; the next day, Hutton announced the talks were off, and
its stock price plunged.
   The Big Board found that Shearson had engaged in "conduct
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade" in
connection with the Hutton stock sale. Separately, the Big
Board said Shearson had broken rules in its acquisition of
the Hutton stake by failing to mark certain Hutton purchases
as trades for the firm's own account, rather than for
customers.
   Besides the record fine, the Big Board ordered Shearson to
appoint a lawyer who for at least three years will advise it
on rules involving securities transactions for its own
account.
   Shearson, in a statement, said: "We did not violate any
law or existing interpretation of the exchange rules. We
determined to settle rather than going through a protracted
process over actions that took place years ago."
   As for the alleged violations involving the marking of
trades for its own account, Shearson said: "We took steps
before there was any indication of a disciplinary proceeding
to help prevent similar processing errors from occurring
again."
