   Volkswagen AG's U.S. sales arm in Troy, Mich., said it
increased base prices of five 1991 models an average of 2%.
   The West German auto maker increased by $200 each the base
prices of its Golf GL two-door, to $8,895, and its GTI and
Jetta GL two-door, both to $10,195, and boosted by $220 the
price of its Passat GL Sedan to $14,990. The VW Vanagon base
price rose $280 to $14,360. VW said it will announce prices
of its two remaining cars, the Cabriolet and Corrado, when
these 1991 models arrive in showrooms.

   Volkswagen has been holding down its prices to counter
slumping U.S. sales in recent years. "This minimal pricing
move will have little impact, because in October of 1989,
retail prices were reduced by 6.7% to 16.6% on these same
models, with exception of the Passat, which was introduced in
March at an extremely competitive price," a company spokesman
said.
   Volkswagen's move follows a rare mid-year price increases
by the U.S. Big Three auto makers, which were seeking to
mitigate "sticker shock" when they announce prices on this
fall's 1991 models.
