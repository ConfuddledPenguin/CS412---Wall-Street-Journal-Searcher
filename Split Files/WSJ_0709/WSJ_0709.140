   HOUSTON -- This city has been preparing, too -- but not
just for a cadre of world leaders and their erudite aides.
   Still smarting from the collapse of its oil and
real-estate industries in the mid-1980s, America's
fourth-largest city is determined to prove it is alive and
well. So, in the belief that as many as 4,000 media
representatives will flock to this week's summit, Houston has
prepared a public-relations extravaganza.

   Months ago, a host committee of 270 top civic, business
and cultural leaders marshaled time, services and products
donated by 10,000 volunteers and prepared to scrub the city's
image. An extraordinary 10-week cleanup drive removed two
million pounds of trash from targeted streets and
neighborhoods. Trees were planted, and special red-and-white
flowers were added along some routes leading to the summit
site, Rice University. (Those colors look best on TV, experts
decided.)
   A "Media Fest" party has been organized, and the night
before sessions begin, favorite son President Bush will play
host to summit luminaries -- and, of course, the press -- at
a barbecue and rodeo.
   The Houston Friendly Committee even devised a special
summit slogan "as a way of encouraging Houstonians to be
friendly to . . . the news media and other dignitaries." The
phrase? "Houston's Hot."
   Which it is. World leaders and reporters willing to
venture outdoors may encounter daytime temperatures well
above 90 degrees and morning humidity around 90%. But civic
boosters insist that's dandy, providing the opening for
well-coached citizens to assure reporters and other visitors
they encounter that Houston is also "hot" when it comes to
its business climate, port facility, energy industry, and
aerospace, medical and convention facilities. (Houstonians
got a pre-summit version of the campaign.)
   "We will convert that negative {the climate} to not only a
positive but to a focused sales opportunity," promised oil
man George Strake, co-chairman of the host committee, who
announced the slogan on a June day when temperature had
already hit 95 degrees.
