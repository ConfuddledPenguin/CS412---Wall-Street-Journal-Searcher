   Taking aim at International Business Machines Corp.,
Digital Equipment Corp. is expected today to unveil a new
generation of its strong-selling MicroVAX computer line,
which analysts say has brought in more than $7 billion in
sales since its debut in 1986.
   The new line underscores Digital's strategic commitment to
proprietary-design minicomputers, despite increasing
competitive pressure from smaller machines running standard
software. Like IBM, Digital has an enormous base of customers
who have made long-term investments in its design.

   "The minicomputer business is actually alive and doing
reasonably well for Digital and IBM," though for other
companies it has probably died, says Jay P. Stevens, an
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The MicroVAX -- at the low end of Digital's flagship line
-- has been a solid performer in a difficult year, growing
about 10% to $2 billion in annual sales, Mr. Stevens says.
But it hasn't been enough to offset the collapse of high-end
revenue in the fiscal year ended June 30, as sales of
Digital's 8000-series machines dwindled to almost nothing and
customers awaited the mainframe-class VAX 9000.
   Despite its reliance on the VAX, Digital in the past year
has stepped up marketing of a new computer design that runs
on standard software, and has built products to bridge
standard and proprietary designs of its own and those of IBM,
Apple Computer Inc. and others.
   In a further reflection of the changing market, Digital
has redesigned its newest VAX for client-server computing, in
which one or more computers act as servers or hubs for
networks of smaller desktop machines. In a departure from
traditional design, the new VAX has several processors nearly
as powerful as the central processor that are dedicated to
speeding up data traffic on the network and allowing
especially fast access to disk-storage devices.
   The new line, to be called the VAX 4000, delivers more
power than IBM's top-of-the-line AS/400 minicomputer, at less
than half the cost, Digital Vice President Bill Demmer said
Friday.
   "The real competition is IBM, and always has been," Mr.
Demmer said. He said several smaller competitors such as
Compaq Computer Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. present
"short-term tactical situations" but that IBM remains
Digital's key strategic focus.
   Dean Witter's Mr. Stevens called the new line aggressively
priced and said it appears somewhat faster than expected. The
models will range in price from $60,910 to $329,000,
depending on configuration.
   The VAX 4000 makes its debut at a scaled-back DECWorld
sales exposition in Boston, the first in two years. At the
show, Digital also is expected to introduce new
network-management software, computer servers dedicated to
tasks such as database access or intensive scientific
computing, and products that tie computer networks together
and connect them to high-speed optical data links.
