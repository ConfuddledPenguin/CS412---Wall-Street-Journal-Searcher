   DALLAS -- Fugitive Texas insurance tycoon Robert H. Walker
was arrested last week on the Caribbean island of Barbados
after a 19-month international manhunt.
   Mr. Walker, the former chief executive officer of
Houston-based National County Mutual Fire Insurance Co.,
vanished in 1988 after the company collapsed in the biggest
insurance failure in Texas history.

   Mr. Walker is being held in a Barbados jail pending a
hearing Thursday on extradition to the U.S., where he faces
29 federal counts of mail and wire fraud. In Texas, he also
faces state charges of theft, misapplication of funds and
filing of false statements in his management of National
County and Walker General Agency, a primary insurance
wholesaler. Both companies were placed in receivership in
late 1988 after National County was declared insolvent.
   David Bourne, chief of the Royal Barbados Police
Department, said Mr. Walker, once rumored to be in
Switzerland, owns at least part of the beachfront hotel where
he was arrested. Mr. Bourne said Mr. Walker has lived there
since March, moving from room to room to escape suspicion.
   U.S. authorities and Texas insurance regulators said they
are seeking court orders so they can seize the hotel, along
with bank accounts and other of Mr. Walker's assets. Mr.
Walker is known for his flashy possessions, including a pair
of $100,000 sterling silver saddles.
   The Texas State Board of Insurance got a tip several
months ago about Mr. Walker's whereabouts, said Chairman
James Saxton. Interpol and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation helped track down the fugitive executive.
   A federal indictment handed down June 12 in Dallas accuses
Mr. Walker of defrauding the insurance companies and their
policyholders of millions of dollars, dragging National
Mutual $56 million into debt. The company's failure left
hundreds of thousands of policyholders in the lurch and
caused a shake-up at the Texas insurance board in which every
member eventually was replaced.
