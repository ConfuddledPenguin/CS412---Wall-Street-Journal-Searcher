   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Retail sales in West Germany in
May rose a real, or price-adjusted, 8.9% from a year earlier,
the Federal Statistics Office said.
   On a nominal, or unadjusted, basis, sales rose 11%, the
first double-digit rise in nominal sales volumes at West
German retailers since the 13% increase in March 1988, when
real sales growth was 7%.
