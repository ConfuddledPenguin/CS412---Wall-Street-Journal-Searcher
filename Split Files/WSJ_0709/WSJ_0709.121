   First Federal Bancorp Inc. said it filed suit to rescind
its federally assisted acquisition of a failed thrift, naming
the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.
   The suit seeks the rescission of the acquisition of
Citizens Federal Savings Bank in Jacksonville, Fla., by a
First Federal Bancorp subsidiary, alleging that actions taken
by the regulatory agencies have frustrated the purpose of the
acquisition and that, therefore, the acquisition is void and
unenforceable. First Federal Bancorp, Pontiac, Mich., took
over Citizens Federal Savings Bank in September 1988 for
$500,000 plus an agreement to inject $4 million in capital.
</LP>

   The suit further alleges that any action taken by the
federal government toward the appointment of a conservator or
receiver of the subsidiary, First Federal Savings Bank &amp;
Trust, is unwarranted.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had no comment on the
suit.
