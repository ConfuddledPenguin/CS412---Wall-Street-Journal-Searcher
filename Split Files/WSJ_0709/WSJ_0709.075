   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, in its latest
response to Democratic charges that it hasn't prosecuted
savings-and-loan fraud vigorously, has chosen 100 thrifts for
accelerated investigation.
   Thrift regulators and Justice Department officials said
last week that newly formed investigative teams drawn from
several federal agencies would review fraud allegations
involving these 100 S&amp;Ls. The officials declined to identify
the targeted institutions. Eventually, enforcers intend to
draw up a list of 300 to 400 major thrift-fraud cases to
investigate, a total far smaller than previous estimates and
one sure to draw criticism from Democratic lawmakers.

   "The numbers haven't been perfected yet," said acting
Deputy Attorney General William Barr. "But it's a universe of
hundreds" of potential major cases. Allegations of
substantial fraud in commercial banks could add another
"couple hundred" cases to the government's list of targets,
he said. Thousands of allegations of fraud involving $25,000
or less are likely to remain unaddressed, officials
acknowledged.
   The criteria used for selecting the top 100 cases included
the amount of losses attributed to illegal actions, the
egregiousness of allegedly fraudulent behavior by thrift
executives and borrowers, and the size of the institutions
involved. No additional resources, beyond those already
announced, will be deployed to address the worst cases,
officials said. Instead, prosecutors and investigators will
be reassigned to problem areas, such as Kansas and Florida,
Mr. Barr said.
   The purposeful disclosure of the list of high-priority
cases is one of a series of actions by the administration to
demonstrate its seriousness in addressing the S&amp;L mess.
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh previously announced the
formation of a variety of regional task forces and the
appointment of special officials to coordinate prosecution of
thrift fraud. President Bush himself attended a recent
campaign-style rally at the Justice Department, where he
exhorted federal prosecutors flown in from all over the
country to "leave no stone unturned" when investigating S&amp;L
improprieties.
   Many of these same prosecutors, as well as senior
officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, say,
however, that the Reagan and Bush administrations, as well as
Congress, haven't provided sufficient resources to battle a
wave of potential criminal cases that began to overwhelm
enforcers as early as the mid-eighties.
   Separately, a Senate subcommittee chaired by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) plans a hearing today on the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board's December 1988 sale of 15 Texas S&amp;Ls to
an Arizona insurance businessman who had been charged with
securities fraud in 1976.
   Mr. Metzenbaum plans to question former Bank Board
officials and state insurance regulators about the
transaction in which James Fail bought the insolvent thrifts
using $1,000 of his own, $70 million in borrowings, and
another $50 million he pledged to invest over the next two
years. The government put up $1.85 billion of assistance in
the deal.
   Mr. Fail was charged with securities fraud in Alabama, but
the charges were dropped and Mr. Fail agreed not to sell
insurance in the state. However, one of Mr. Fail's companies
pleaded guilty to securities fraud in Alabama, investigators
for Mr. Metzenbaum have learned.
   Mr. Metzenbaum also intends to investigate the role played
by an ex-aide to President Bush, Robert Thompson, who wrote
letters to Bank Board officials to help Mr. Fail bid for the
Texas thrifts, according to Mr. Metzenbaum's investigation.
Mr. Thompson had previously handled congressional contacts
for Mr. Bush when Mr. Bush was vice president.
   Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson couldn't be reached for comment.
A press spokesman for Sen. Metzenbaum said Mr. Fail, Mr.
Thompson, and Danny Wall, who was chairman of the Bank Board
when the thrifts were sold, declined invitations to testify
today.
