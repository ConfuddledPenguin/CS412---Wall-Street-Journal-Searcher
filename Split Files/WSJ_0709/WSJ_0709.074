   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- BC Sugar Refinery Ltd., in
a two-step move that would make it Canada's biggest sugar
refiner, said it agreed to acquire 50% of Montreal-based
Lantic Sugar Ltd. for 110 million Canadian dollars (US$94.2
million).
   The pact to acquire the stake from Lantic's 100%-owner,
Toronto-based Jannock Ltd., includes an option enabling BC
Sugar to acquire Jannock's remaining interest in Lantic, on
terms that weren't disclosed, after Dec. 31, 1991.

   "The acquisition of Lantic Sugar provides a good strategic
fit for BC Sugar's long-term interests," said company
president and chief executive officer, William Brown.
Lantic's two refineries in eastern Canada produce about
450,000 metric tons of sugar annually, or about 50% of
Canada's output. Lantic also operates a big sugar refinery in
Yonkers, N.Y.
   Century-old BC Sugar, which produces about 21% of Canada's
refined sugar at plants in British Columbia, Alberta, and
Manitoba, has been seeking to expand outside of its
traditional western Canadian base for some time. Indeed, BC
Sugar was foiled in January when a previous pact to acquire
50% of Lantic from Montreal's Steinberg Inc. was thwarted by
Jannock.
   Jannock, a diversified manufacturing concern, exercised
its right of first refusal to acquire Steinberg's stake in
Lantic, after BC Sugar made its original offer. But BC Sugar
continued to pursue Lantic, and Jannock "ultimately came to
the decision that they were interested in taking on a
partner," Mr. Brown said.
   Jannock's executives weren't available for comment.
   BC Sugar, which had revenue of C$289 million last year,
plans to finance the purchase entirely through bank debt, Mr.
Brown said. As a result, long-term debt will jump to about
C$140 million from the current C$30 million, said James
Hudson, vice president, finance, compared to shareholders'
equity of about C$94 million. "We're comfortable with that,"
he said.
   Mr. Brown said BC Sugar doesn't expect to encounter
opposition to the proposed purchase from Canada's antitrust
regulators, whom he said view the transaction favorably.
"That's been covered off," he said.
