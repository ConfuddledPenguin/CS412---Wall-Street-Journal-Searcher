   PORTLAND, Ore. -- Riedel Environmental Technologies Inc.,
citing delays in Environmental Protection Agency orders and
other environmental remediation work, said it expects to
report a net loss in its second quarter. In the year-earlier
quarter, the company earned $563,000, or 16 cents a share, on
$19.1 million in revenue.
   The company also announced that it received approval from
Seattle to proceed in a joint venture for a 10-year, $42
million sludge management services contract. Riedel's stock
closed Friday at $12.25 a share, down 12.5 cents, in American
Stock Exchange composite trading.
