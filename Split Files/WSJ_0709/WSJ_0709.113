   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. said it made further changes in
an agreement to sell its Australian breweries to associate
company Bell Resources Ltd.
   Australia-based Bond Corp. has extended a deadline for
completing the sale of the Australian breweries to July 31
from June 30.

   Bond Corp. said in March that it intended to sell the
Australian breweries to 58%-owned Bell Resources for 1.85
billion Australian dollars (US$1.48 billion), as part of a
program to reduce debt by selling assets. Bond Corp. owes
Bell Resources about A$1 billion, which has been turned into
a deposit for the breweries.
   However, Bond Corp. said in a statement late Friday that
if the sale isn't completed by July 31 it will be required to
repay the deposit on Aug. 17.
   Terms of the purchase price also have been altered, Bond
Corp. said, to include certain brand names in Britain.
   Bond Corp. also said it has altered terms of a previously
announced agreement to sell some of its stake in Bond Media
Ltd. to Bell Resources.
