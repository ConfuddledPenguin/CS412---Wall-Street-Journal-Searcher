   WASHINGTON -- With the Air Force budget belching black
smoke and heading into a tailspin, a lot of people are
wondering whether the right pilot is at the controls.
   No one can dispute Air Force Secretary Donald Rice's
credentials for the job. A lanky Ph.D. economist who before
he turned 33 was president of Rand Corp., one of the world's
pre-eminent think tanks, Mr. Rice has spent nearly all of his
adult life analyzing defense issues.

   Many lawmakers and other critics, however, do question the
scholarly, slow-talking secretary's strategy and political
instincts. They contend that he -- as well as the rest of the
Air Force's leadership -- has failed to react swiftly enough
to the repercussions of the diminishing Soviet military
threat. While the Navy has largely successfully sold the
importance of maritime power in the current era and the Army
has adopted a reasonably cooperative attitude toward budget
cutters, the Air Force has dug in its institutional heels.
   The result is that it has, if anything, become even more
of a target for public flak and raids on its budget by
Congress. "The Air Force isn't very credible in making its
case" says Gordon Adams, head of the nonpartisan Defense
Budget Project, because "the leadership seems wedded to a
backward-looking approach . . . that Congress isn't likely to
swallow." Rep. John Dingell, (D., Mich.) has complained that
lax management controls illustrate "the chaos within Air
Force management."
   Under any circumstances, the Air Force would probably be
having the toughest political time of any of the services
right now. In an era of big federal deficits and
defense-budget cutting, it promotes the military's most
expensive and embattled new weapons. In addition, says
Secretary Rice, "there is so much focus on the Air Force"
because of deep-seated public suspicion of anything connected
with nuclear weapons. "We are the service most closely
associated with {such} weapons," he says.
   Responding to critics, the Air Force chief invariably
tries to shift the focus from personal questions to broader
management issues. Despite close ties to the Pentagon
bureaucracy since his earlier days at Rand, "we have done
quite a lot to shake up the acquisition system" and to
declassify details about weapons projects that "had been kept
under wraps longer than necessary," Mr. Rice says.
   But others say the Air Force's situation has been made all
the more difficult because of a string of embarrassing
procurement snafus, lobbying missteps and management lapses
that have undermined public and congressional support.
   So far, Mr. Rice has balked at bringing in someone new to
run the Air Force's procurement office, despite major costs
and quality problems afflicting the C-17 transport, the next
generation air-to-air missile and other weapons. Even
frustrated supporters blame him for plugging unrealistically
high spending requests and then failing to provide Congress
with adequate information to support them.
   Sen. James Exon (D., Neb.), an essential ally on the Armed
Services Committee, last month warned that he wouldn't wage
an all-out fight to protect Air Force programs "only to have
the usual procedure where next year the administration comes
back with some sad story about higher costs."
   Mr. Rice has made some recent moves to placate critics. In
the past few months, he has tried to shift the Air Force's
emphasis toward conventional threats and potential Third
World hot spots, instead of missiles and long-range nuclear
missions.
   Taking the offensive, Mr. Rice also asserts that many
earlier foul-ups are now becoming public precisely because he
prodded the generals to be more forthcoming. Critics often
lambaste the service, he says, "without recognizing that the
Air Force uncovered and identified the problems" in the first
place. "They don't stay bottled up like they used to."
   The desperate fight to save the Air Force's crown jewel,
the B-2 Stealth bomber, illustrates the limits of this new
spirit of openness. Since Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
decision months ago to build only 75 of the proposed
132-plane fleet, lawmakers have been clamoring for detailed
cost estimates. But the Air Force has fended off many of
those demands -- perhaps because they might show that further
cuts in B-2 production rates could push costs into the
stratospheric region of nearly $1 billion for each plane.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) is so
worried about erosion of support for the Air Force that he
quietly organized a special task force of GOP congressional
aides to study the B-2 -- and presumably recommend a
legislative strategy different from the one offered by the
Pentagon. "The silk-scarf set is willing to sacrifice
everything to keep the B-2 alive," says Jay Kosminsky, a
defense analyst at the Heritage Foundation.
   To find money for the bat-shaped bomber, the Air Force
also turned its back on White House policies to develop two
mobile nuclear-tipped missiles: the large, multiple warhead
MX and the less powerful Midgetman, intended to be trucked
around U.S. highways on specially equipped trailers.
   Mr. Rice wants to save $3 billion next year alone by
putting both missiles on the back burner. But many GOP
stalwarts who invested a lot of political capital last year
to push development of both systems angrily dismiss the Air
Force's position as a sell-out. Even Gen. Larry Welch, the
Air Force chief of staff, acknowledges that "there is a lot
of blood on the floor" from those battles.
   Making matters worse, the Air Force has recently weathered
a series of reports and allegations about its procurement and
accounting practices. Investigators, for example, identified
some $13 billion of excess spare parts at Air Force locations
around the country. A radar-warning contract with a potential
value of $2 billion was tainted by alleged influence-peddling
involving consultants and an important civilian Air Force
acquisition official.
   Just a few months ago, the General Accounting Office found
a $2.4 billion accounting discrepancy in some of the Air
Force's space-related accounts and concluded that officials
balanced the books by resorting to "unsupported and arbitrary
adjustments."
   "They love to make the room dark, show you lots of slides
and bring in generals with plenty of stars to brief you,"
says Rep. John Kasich (R., Ohio), one of the leaders in the
bipartisan effort to kill the B-2. "I just don't believe
their numbers."
   For all the service's woes right now, Mr. Rice still
pursues his dream of having the Air Force compete
aggressively with the Navy as the primary vehicle to project
U.S. power around the world. Air Force generals claim they
can fill that role at a lower cost than aircraft
carrier-based planes, if only Congress and the public gives
them the chance. "We are getting shot out of the sky by the
Navy," former Air Force Secretary Verne Orr flatly told a
defense group earlier this year. "They're making points with
the public and we are not."
   But earning that chance to compete won't be easy for the
Air Force's leaders. "They have to learn how to sell a
mission and a mystique, like the Marines," says Jeffrey
Record, an Air Force critic at the Hudson Institute. "They
can't just peddle airplanes any longer."
