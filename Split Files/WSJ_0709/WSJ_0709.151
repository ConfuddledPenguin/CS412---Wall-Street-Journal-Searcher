   Low Volume, Not a Major-Crisis Sign,
   Is Still a Worrisome Indicator to Many

   NEW YORK -- If the stock market had a dashboard full of
indicator lights, the one marked "Low Volume" would have been
glowing red for months.
   Shrinking volume on the New York Stock Exchange no longer
signals a four-alarm crisis, as many analysts once thought,
but nobody proclaims it a positive development either. Many
investors cite lackluster trading activity as one reason that
though they keep a hand in the market, the other is on the
emergency-exit panic bar.

   Last week was far from typical, there being a holiday
smack in the middle, but daily average Big Board volume
evaporated to a mere 125 million shares. Yet prices snapped
up and down like a flag in a stiff breeze, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average falling 32 points Thursday and jumping
back 25 points Friday -- on the snooziest trading day of the
year, at 111,730,000 shares.
   Actually, trading activity has been slowing since last
August, while the Dow industrials have risen about 150 points
to new records. So far this year, daily Big Board volume has
averaged 155,800,000 shares, down 18% from the peak of
188,900,000 in 1987, and 9% below last August's average of
171,700,000.
   The old-fashioned view is that volume explains price. For
example, rising volume as prices move significantly either up
or down suggests that trend will accelerate. Surging volume
at the end of a long decline indicates the slide will soon
end, while declining volume in a rising market means the
advance may be about over.
   Small wonder there was little joy on Wall Street during a
five-day rally ended last Tuesday, in which the Dow climbed
70 points but average daily volume sank to 137,700,000 shares
-- more than 11% below this year's slackened pace.
   "We're participating" in the stock market, says Timothy
Clark, associate director of research at Avatar Associates, a
New York money-management concern. But because of declining
volume, he says, "we've got our eyes on the exits here a
little more than we usually do."
   Analysts offer plenty of explanations why -- this time,
anyway -- nothing terrible is about to happen because volume
is waning. A sampler:
   -- Volume in the 1980s was bloated by corporate takeover
activity and all the speculation that went along with it.
Thus, volume may simply be returning to more sustainable
levels while prices do their own thing.
   -- Institutional investors can get more than 8.40% on
10-year Treasury notes, so they trade less stock. "Most money
managers would kill to report 8% growth without risk," says
Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at St.
Louis-based A.G. Edwards.
   -- With all the stock that has been taken out of
investors' hands by corporate buy-backs, takeovers and
restructurings, prices of the remaining shares could climb on
fewer trades. "Plus," adds money manager Robert Stovall of
Stovall/Twenty First Advisers, "there's a very low level of
{competing} opportunity in such investments as real estate
and precious metals."
   -- Program trading, which can whip prices abruptly higher
or lower in the blink of an eye, has scared away many
investors. "Declining volume is a function of disinterest in
the market," says Mark Liebovit, the Sedona, Ariz., publisher
of the Volume Reversal Survey. "The average Joe just doesn't
give a damn." Since the October 1987 crash, individual
investors have fled the market in favor of mutual funds,
which can do battle on more equal footing with big
institutional investors and those who use sophisticated
computer-driven trading strategies.
   Despite such reassurances, some traditional technical
analysts see the volume slump as bad news, indeed. Walter
Stone of Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Co., a Boston-based mutual fund
research firm, believes declining volume means that buying
interest is waning. "You have to have daily volume of over
200 million shares to confirm that we're in a continuation of
the bull market," Mr. Stone contends.
   Failing that, he foresees a two-year bear market in which
the Dow industrials could retreat 65% to 1000. Mr. Stone
currently recommends a portfolio mix of 35% cash, 25%
government bonds, 15% quality international bonds, 15%
quality corporate bonds, and 10% gold. No stocks.
   While Mr. Stone stands practically alone in his
willingness to stick his neck out with a two-year forecast,
his peers don't dismiss him as a quack. "Walter Stone is not
a hollow guy," says Robert Farrell, Merrill Lynch's chief
market analyst, who agrees that "volume is not bullish right
now." He notes that immediately after the October 1987 crash,
Mr. Stone correctly predicted the market would head higher.
   Some other analysts are inclining toward Mr. Stone's view
but aren't willing to leap to his conclusions. Richard Arms,
a technical analyst at Albuquerque, N.M.-based Eppler, Guerin
&amp; Turner, tracks relative volume movements in advancing and
declining issues. Since last August, he says, each of the
market's significant advances has been accompanied by waning
investor interest, as evidenced by declining volume.
   "The next likely {major} move is down," Mr. Arms says,
"but I want the market to tell me that."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose despite a big rise in interest rates
that followed strong employment data. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed up 25.74 to 2904.95.
   On the last day of a holiday-shortened week, trading
slowed on the New York Stock Exchange to 111,730,000 shares,
a low for the year, down from 114,800,000 on the previous
slowest day, March 12, and down from 128,320,000 shares
Thursday.
   For the week, the Dow industrials gained 24.26 points, or
0.8%. Broader market measures didn't keep pace: Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
rose just 0.1% for the week, while the New York Stock
Exchange composite index added 0.2%.
   Investors saw signs of economic strength in the June
employment report, and a hint that second-quarter earnings
may be strong.
   Nonfarm payrolls rose 40,000 in June, and the unemployment
rate unexpectedly fell to 5.2%. More important, the increase
in May payrolls was revised upward sharply to 356,000 jobs
from 164,000.
   Long-term Treasury issues fell about 1 1/8 points, or
$11.25 for each $1,000 face amount, pushing yields up to
8.50%.
   Several rounds of buy programs tied to stock-index
arbitrage helped stocks avoid a similar sell-off, as did
bargain-hunting after the market's setback Thursday, traders
said.
   Investors continued to focus on consumer stocks, which are
seen as safe bets for better earnings. Both Philip Morris,
which rose 1 3/4 to 49 1/4 on 2.8 million shares, and
PepsiCo, which advanced 2 1/8 to 79 7/8, hit new 52-week
highs; Procter &amp; Gamble went up 1 3/8 to 89, tying its
52-week high.
   Boeing climbed 1 1/4 to 60 5/8 on 1.2 million shares.
British Airways placed orders for 21 of the company's 747-400
aircraft, and took options on 12 others, for a deal valued at
nearly $7 billion.
   Panhandle Eastern tumbled 1 to 19 3/8 and was the Big
Board's most active issue at 2.9 million shares. For the
week, the stock plummeted 20.9% amid increasingly heavy
selling. Speculation about a possible reduction in its
dividend sparked the sell-off; the latest decline occurred
after the company acknowledged that its board is expected to
review its payout policy at a meeting July 25.
   Gannett fell 5/8 to 36 1/2. The company expects to report
that second-quarter earnings were lower than a year earlier,
which would be the first year-over-year decline in quarterly
earnings since it went public 22 years ago.
   Quantum Chemical declined 1 1/4 to 15 3/8. Goldman Sachs
issued a sell recommendation on the stock and lowered its
earnings estimates, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report. Analyst Avi Nash, who follows the company
for Goldman, wasn't available for comment.
   Arco Chemical fell 3/4 to 39 in the wake of an explosion
Thursday night at its Channelview, Texas, plant. At least 17
people died in the blast, the Associated Press reported.
   H.J. Heinz added 3/8 to 34 1/2 after its board decided to
exclude the company from all provisions of Pennsylvania's new
anti-takeover law.
   Comstock Partners Strategy Fund dipped 1/8 to 9 1/4 on 1.3
million shares. A block of one million shares of the
closed-end bond fund was traded just after the opening,
accounting for most of the volume.
