   For the first half of fiscal 1990, the manufacturer of
semiconductors and related devices reported a loss of $11.8
million, or 65 cents a share. In the year-earlier first half,
the company had net income of $5.2 million, or 28 cents a
share.
   Company President Raphael Klein said the concern was
unable to meet orders because of manufacturing difficulties
that have plagued it for several quarters. The company has
recently completed a $50 million factory renovation.
