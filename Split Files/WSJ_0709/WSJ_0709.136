   UAL Corp.'s unions said five major banks have agreed to
lead the labor group's effort to obtain financing for the
proposed $4.38 billion acquisition of United Airlines.
   Enlistment of the five banks marks an important step in
the buy-out effort, but it still leaves labor several steps
short of completing financing by an Aug. 9 deadline.

   In a recorded message to its members, the United pilots
union disclosed Saturday night that the five banks are
Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York
Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Chemical Banking Corp.
These New York-based banks "will be both participating in and
leading the syndication of the financing," the message said.
   None of the five banks identified by the unions could be
reached to confirm their participation. There was also some
indication that at least some of those banks hadn't yet
signed formal agreements with the buy-out group.
   The unions need about $4.5 billion to cover the cash
portion of the offer as well as to refinance existing debt
and provide working capital for the airline.
   None of the five banks has made a firm commitment to
provide any portion of the financing. The banks told the
unions that they will decide whether to commit their own
funds only after further study of the acquisition proposal,
union advisers said.
   Furthermore, the banks are insisting that the unions
obtain at least $300 million of the financing from
non-banking sources, such as airline suppliers. The banks
want this financing to be subordinate to their own
contribution to protect them in the event of a default,
people familiar with the situation said.
   The unions are talking with a variety of suppliers about
possibly investing in the buy-out in return for a note or
nonvoting preferred stock in UAL. Most recently, the
negotiations have centered on Boeing Corp., the Seattle-based
aircraft manufacturer, and General Electric Co., the
Fairfield, Conn., maker of jet engines.
   Even if the unions meet the banks' conditions, the
financing effort would be far from complete. The five lead
banks are expected to offer about $500 million each, or a
total of $2.5 billion. They would then have to find other
sources willing to finance the additional $2 billion needed.
   The complexity of the financing negotiations and the
amount of work remaining to be done raises the possibility
that the unions might have to ask for an extension of the
Aug. 9 financing deadline. Union advisers declined to comment
on such a possibility. The company's directors might agree to
such an extension if it appeared that the unions could
complete the financing work in an additional month or so.
   Indeed, the unions disclosed their talks with the five
banks after the board pressed them last week to show some
evidence of progress. The board made its request after the
unions asked the company to postpone selecting the suppliers
for a major aircraft and engine order.
   Last week, UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf appeared ready to
make a decision on the order. The unions feared that such a
move would hamper their financing talks with suppliers. The
labor groups sought and won a commitment from the
Chicago-based company's board to postpone placing an order.
The labor group is using the order as a carrot to convince
suppliers to help them with the buy-out financing.
   Union advisers said over the weekend that "three to four"
other major banks are considering participating in the deal.
"This is evidence that this is a sound transaction," said
John Peterpaul, vice president of the International
Association of Machinists, one of the three UAL unions
spearheading the buy-out. Union advisers said these other
banks must be willing to commit at least $500 million each.
   Two of the banks said to be involved in the current
effort, Citicorp and Chase Manhattan, also acted as the
co-lead banks for an earlier, failed labor-management bid.
Those banks had agreed to contribute $3 billion toward the
earlier $6.75 billion bid and said they were "highly
confident" of raising an additional $4 billion for the deal.
Both banks were widely criticized when they failed to
complete the financing.
   This time, the unions decided to enlist a larger number of
banks from the outset in what's known as a "club" financing.
The advantage of club financing is that it spreads the
responsibility for arranging the loan among a larger number
of banks. It also reduces the loan amount that each lead bank
has to redistribute among smaller banks in the syndication
process.
   One of the obvious benefits for the banks is that they are
likely to realize fees as high as 4% to 5% for backing the
buy-out because the market for financing is far more
expensive than it was last year.
   After a nearly 10-month lull following the collapse of the
earlier labor-management bid for UAL, banks appear ready
again to finance what they consider well-structured leveraged
transactions.
   Separately, if the buy-out succeeds, the labor group said
it planned to name as directors Robert Lanigan, chairman of
Owens-Illinois Inc.; J. Richard Munro, chairman of the
executive committee of Time Warner Inc., and Donald Perkins,
former chairman of Jewel Food Stores, a unit of American
Superstores Inc.
   The group said the three executives were recommended by an
executive recruiting firm. If the labor buy-out succeeds,
UAL's board will consist of three management directors, four
labor representatives and eight outside directors. Union
leaders would have veto power over the appointment of any
outside directors. The independent directors would also have
to be approved by Gerald Greenwald, the unions' designee for
UAL chairman.
