   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department's new jobless figures
pose a difficult problem for government policy makers.
   The numbers show the economy is expanding at a painfully
sluggish rate, with only 40,000 new jobs created in June.
Manufacturing employment fell by 30,000 during the month.

   But at the same time, the unemployment rate among
civilians remained at historic lows, dropping to 5.2% in June
from 5.3% in May. Many economists, including those at the
Federal Reserve, believe joblessness can't drop any lower
without sparking increased inflation.
   As a result, the new numbers aren't likely to prompt the
Federal Reserve to ease credit. Fed officials wouldn't
comment on the numbers for the record. But it was clear they
saw little reason in the report to change their course and
move toward lower short-term interest rates.
   "This is the classical mixed bag," said Robert Dederick,
chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "We have a
slower economy but one that is growing about as fast as we
can afford to."
   Bush administration officials have been pressuring the Fed
recently to help the economy by easing credit. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, in particular, made repeated
comments last week calling for lower interest rates.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also lashed out at the Fed
Friday, with economist Lawrence Hunter saying the employment
numbers show "it's time for the Fed to let interest rates
fall" to keep the economy out of recession.
   But Fed officials, aware that the unemployment rate is
near its lowest level in two decades, can find little
justification for easing. They note that the low unemployment
rate is confirmed by other data, such as independent state
figures on claims for unemployment insurance. Moreover, they
see no evidence in the latest report that the economy is
sliding into recession.
   The slow job growth in June was due partly to the layoffs
of 55,000 temporary census workers. Excluding these
government workers, who have skewed the numbers in recent
months, job growth in June was about 90,000. That's about the
pace of private job growth that has been typical since the
first of this year, although it's less than half the rate of
the first half of last year.
   The mystery in the Labor Department numbers, however, is
that growth in the labor force -- those people actively
seeking jobs -- has also slowed sharply in recent months.
Janet Norwood, who heads the department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics, said the civilian labor force rose by only
290,000 people in the first six months of 1990, compared with
1.5 million in the first half of last year.
   The reason for this sluggish growth isn't entirely clear.
In part, it reflects demographic trends, with fewer
teen-agers entering the work force each year. It also seems
to reflect a slowing of the flood of women who rushed into
the work force in the 1970s and 1980s. And it's also due to a
rise in discouraged workers, who have given up looking for
employment.
   The result is that, despite sluggish job growth, the
unemployment rate -- which is the percentage of the total
labor force unable to find employment -- is dropping.
   The June growth in payrolls followed a revised increase of
355,000 in May. But that, too, was distorted by an
unexpectedly large hiring of temporary census workers.
Excluding government workers, May's rise was about 94,000.
   Including the military, the unemployment rate in June
dropped to 5.1% from 5.3%.
   The numbers in the employment report are adjusted for
seasonal variations.
   Separately, the Fed confirmed that its policy-making Open
Market Committee voted 10-1 in May to maintain a steady grip
on credit without leaning toward either easier or tighter
policy.
   A summary of the committee's May 15 meeting, released
Friday after the customary six-week lag, shows that Fed
policy makers "generally agreed" that keeping interest rates
steady would produce "relatively moderate but sustained
economic expansion."
   The Fed officials also concluded that "the prospects for
significant reduction in inflation pressures during the
quarters immediately ahead were not promising," the summary
says.
   Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland, dissented at the May 15 meeting. A consistent
advocate of "zero inflation," Mr. Hoskins wanted tighter
monetary policy. The voting members of the committee include
the six current Fed governors and five of the 12 district
reserve bank presidents.
