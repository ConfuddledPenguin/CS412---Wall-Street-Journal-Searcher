   While many universities expect freshman class sizes to
drop this year, a number of historically black schools are
reporting a boom in freshman enrollment not seen since the
1970s.
   Improved recruitment and higher visibility, as well as an
increase in racial harassment on predominantly white
campuses, have led some black institutions to establish their
first waiting lists ever. Other schools, hit with a deluge of
applications, cut short their admission deadlines by a month
or more.

   For a number of predominantly black universities, the rise
in applications and admissions brings a welcome increase in
revenue after years of financial strain. In contrast, some
predominantly white schools are considering belt-tightening
maneuvers like laying off staff and freezing salaries. The
number of high school graduates nationwide isn't expected to
rebound to last year's level of 2.7 million until 1997.
   "The pool of black students going to black colleges has
really gotten larger," says Sondra Reine, recruitment
coordinator at Xavier University in New Orleans. Xavier's
freshman class has almost doubled in size in the past five
years, from about 350 in 1986 to about 600 this fall. This
spring, for the first time in Xavier's 65-year history, the
school placed 250 applicants on a waiting list.
   Spelman College, in Atlanta, received 3,315 applications
this year, almost double its total enrollment of 1,789. This
year's freshman class of about 490 will be 6% bigger than
last year's. The school, which was founded in 1881, received
a well publicized $20 million gift from Bill Cosby and his
wife, Camille, in November 1988 just before the college's
first black woman president was inaugurated.
   Morehouse College, also in Atlanta, expects about 650
freshmen this year, 17% more than last year. Hampton
University, in Hampton, Va., says about 1,400 freshmen will
attend in the fall, up 16% from last year, while Florida A&amp;M
University, in Tallahassee, Fla., is predicting 13.6% more
freshmen, or about 2,530 students.
   Admissions officials say the increase in class size has
been accompanied by an improvement in applicants' grades and
test scores. According to the Educational Testing Service,
average Scholastic Aptitude Test scores for blacks have risen
in the past five years to 737 from 722.
   Some schools, like Howard University, in Washington, D.C.,
are expecting smaller freshman classes this year. But many of
these declines follow record freshman class sizes last year.
   The majority of the 1.1 million black college students in
the U.S. attend predominantly white schools. But in the past
five years, the number of blacks attending black institutions
has increased 10% to 294,427, according to the National
Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education. And
that increase has come, the U.S. Education Department says,
as the percentage of black 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in
colleges has declined.
   Educators attribute the renaissance at black institutions
in part to racial conflicts in many cities and on many
predominantly white campuses. According to the National
Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, a policy-research
group in Baltimore, 20% to 25% of all minority students in
U.S. colleges experience some form of racial harassment every
year.
   But other factors in the trend include high-profile
alumni; awareness created by the television show "A Different
World," which centers on life at a black college; low
tuition; and a renewed desire among many blacks to study in
an environment that is more sensitive to their history,
culture and needs.
   "I recommend that all black students spend at least a
semester at a black school. It's good to be in an academic
setting where you don't have to feel like a minority and you
don't have to worry about racism affecting how you're graded
or evaluated," says Charles M. Boyd, 24, who was accepted at
Harvard University and Princeton University but attended
Howard as an undergraduate. Mr. Boyd is now in his final year
at Harvard Medical School.
   Adds LaTonya Davis, 18, of San Jose, Calif., "I've been
going to {predominantly} white schools all my life. Now, I
want to learn from black professors . . . see my own people
striving . . . working together and getting the job done."
Ms. Davis, who applied to four historically black colleges,
will attend Florida A&amp;M in the fall.
