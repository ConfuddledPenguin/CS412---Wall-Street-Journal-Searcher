   ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Need a bundle of Romanian scythe
blades? Some Czech ball bearings? A set of Soviet
compressed-air diving tanks, perhaps? Or, at a knockdown
price, one of those "Made in the U.S.S.R." watches beloved by
Italian and New York boutiques?
   All these and more are piled high on tables in an old
parking lot next to Istanbul's Grand Bazaar. This so-called
Polish Market is one of the stranger byproducts of the
upheavals in Eastern Europe.

   "Yes, it is junk, but it's cheap," said Ali Mutlu, head of
the 250 Turkish stall-holders.
   Free at last to travel abroad, bright-eyed East Europeans
are selling whatever they can bring to the market to raise
money for purchases of long-cherished jeans and cheap Turkish
consumer goods. Such informal trade is only a small part of a
swelling tide of contacts and commerce between Turkey and the
nearby countries of the East bloc, especially the Soviet
Union.
   Optimistic Turks hope that their strategic position --
once important as the guardian of the southern third of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's frontier with the Warsaw
Pact -- may pay a "peace dividend" of unrivaled access to new
markets in the southern Soviet republics, the Balkans and
Transcaucasia.
   Turkish President Turgut Ozal goes as far as to speak of a
Black Sea "economic zone" running as far east as the port of
Trabzon, where a border opened in 1988 now brings regular
busloads of bargain-hunting Soviets from Georgia and
Azerbaijan.
   "It's a fit -- our consumer goods and their natural
resources," said Tayfun Beyazit, executive vice president of
Yapi Kredi Bank, which says it finances 40% of Soviet-Turkish
trade. He had to speak up to be heard over the jackhammers
tearing up the Istanbul street outside for a big pipeline
network to distribute Soviet natural gas in Turkey.
   Imports of gas from the Soviet Union piped in over the
Bulgarian border since 1987 are due to rise to between 3.5
billion and four billion cubic meters (122.5 billion and 140
billion cubic feet) this year and reach six billion cubic
meters by the mid-1990s, said Boris Rudnev, commercial
attache at the Soviet Embassy here. "We have signed a total
$1.2 billion worth of trade deals so far this year. It could
be $2 billion by the end of the year," he added.
   Turkey-East bloc trade volume was already up 43% in 1989
to $2 billion, of which $1.3 billion was with Moscow. The
number of East bloc visitors grew 21% to 300,000 last year;
in the first two months of 1990, their numbers increased by
50% -- mostly because of Soviets and newly freed Romanians,
who in January clogged the main road from the west to
Istanbul for weeks.
   Turkey's new state Export-Import Bank is doing its part by
pushing loans, so far mostly to buy Turkish consumer goods;
$300 million was advanced to Moscow in 1989 and $50 million
to Bucharest in May. Turkey also is making similar offers to
Budapest and Warsaw.
   Another $350 million credit to Moscow for Turks to build
about 15 factories in the Soviet Union will be signed soon,
according to the bank's general manager, Turgay Ozkan.
   "The Soviet loans are all secured against the cash element
of future gas payments," Mr. Ozkan said. Turkey makes 30% of
its gas payments in cash and 70% in goods and contracting
services.
   Turkey's credit rating has overtaken the Soviet Union's in
the past year, and Istanbul businessmen complain of
increasing delays in payments from the Soviets. "The
traditional roles have reversed, but we are very cautious,
not just jumping in, not lending for the sake of lending,"
Mr. Ozkan said.
   Turkey is especially hopeful that its building industry --
which has considerable foreign experience -- will flourish in
the Soviet Union; Turkish contractors say their prices
undercut those of Western European companies by 30% or more.
   Ten Turkish companies won Soviet construction contracts in
the last two years, but only five of them through the
gas-payments program, said David Tonge of Istanbul
consultants International Business Services.
   "The Turks have the advantage of being close by, a labor
force at ease with Soviet conditions and businessmen used to
confusing bureaucracy," said Mr. Tonge. He is about to
publish "Turkey: Route to the Soviet Market," aimed at those
who want to do business in the Soviet Union via Turkey.
   "Many U.S. companies are thinking of making
investment-manufacturing operations in Turkey with the
long-term aim of exporting to the Soviet Union," said Marc
Grossman, deputy head of mission at the U.S. Embassy, in a
recent speech to businessmen. "We welcome Soviet-Turkish
trade expansion . . . there is no reason why Turkey cannot
turn into a major supplier of the Soviet Union," he added.
   Turkey's advantages are largely relative: Foreign
investment is far simpler and safer than in the East bloc,
good Turkey-U.S. and Turkey-Soviet trade agreements are
already in place and, as a backstop, the Turkish domestic
market is growing rapidly.
   Repatriation of profits from the Soviet market also may be
helped by the way Turkey is considering buying Soviet rail,
metro and other technology in major projects.
   One result of the new Turkish-Soviet cooperation is
Greenair, which Turkish businessmen say is the first-ever
joint venture between the Soviet airline Aeroflot and a
private-sector group. Three Greenair Soviet-built Tupolevs
already are flying Turkish domestic routes, and the airline
plans to expand to Europe and Japan. Ali Sen, the main
Turkish partner, said Greenair was aiming to manage a fleet
of 40 Soviet planes by 1992.
   But despite all the talk, there are no examples yet of
major Western investment in Turkey aimed mainly at exporting
to the East bloc, although Mr. Grossman said there had been
some expansion of existing investments.
   "We're working hard at it, but our approach is very
opportunistic," said a representative of a major U.S. company
that exports large amounts of detergent made by its Turkish
subsidiary to the Soviet Union. "It's something we think
could dry up completely next year."
   Soviet diplomats themselves note that seven joint ventures
set up in Turkey in the past two years and five more to come
still are minor operations for the 1,500 foreign companies in
Turkey. Flights from Istanbul to Moscow may be booked weeks
in advance, but at the Istanbul bazaar Soviet rubles aren't
accepted, while Hungarian forints, Czech korunas and even
Polish zlotys are.
   "Really, their (the Soviets') buying power is zero," said
Nasir Yenihayat, whose jeans-shop window on the cobbled road
up from a dock for Soviet cruise ships was decorated with two
model Soviet cars. "They pay in dollars and try to barter
with vodka and toys. We don't lose money, but we don't rip
them off either. We know they are in a tough position."
   Ishak Alaton, a Turkish business leader who now keeps
books by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on his coffee
table, believes there is more to the Turkish-Soviet
relationship than just an economic conjunction.
   The European Community's polite rebuttal last year to
Turkey's application for EC membership meant that the East
bloc was worth considering as an alternative partner, Mr.
Alaton said, adding that he sometimes feels treated as a
second-class citizen in the West but not in Moscow.
   "In some ways, we are tired of waiting" for EC membership
and social acceptance, he said. "The Turk is tempted to think
he has found (in the Russian) a long-lost cousin he can
embrace."
