   Everything that is written
   Has been written before;
   There are slight variations,
   Hardly anything more.

   There is nothing to it --
   Unless, of course,
   You're trying to do it.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   When parents warn
   Of snares and sin
   The ear teen-agers
   Turn is tin.

   All the world loves a lover, except the people who are
waiting to use the phone.
