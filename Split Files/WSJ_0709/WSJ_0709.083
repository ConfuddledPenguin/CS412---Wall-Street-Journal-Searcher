   The railroad industry, turning to cost cuts to offset
continuing slow industrial freight shipments, is expected to
post average second-quarter earnings gains of 5% to 7%.
   For the expected strongest performer, Burlington Northern
Inc., earnings growth reflected robust coal and grain
shipments and the company's limited exposure to the vagaries
of new automobile shipments. But even railroads that are more
heavily dependent upon industrial freight shipments fared
reasonably well, analysts said, reflecting vigorous
cost-cutting.

   "The railroads' improved efficiency is boosting earnings
in a lackluster economy," said Gary Yablon, an analyst at
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., who expects the group's
second-quarter profit from continuing operations "to be up in
the mid-single digits." Mr. Yablon said railroads have
tightened scheduling of freight trains, lowered car-hire
costs, reduced manpower, cut material use, and reduced
little-used track.
   A Burlington Northern spokesman said the company is
"comfortable" with analysts' estimates that second-quarter
net income was about 81 cents a share compared with 74 cents
a share in the year-earlier period. The spokesman said
continued growth in coal shipments reflected new contracts
with utilities in the railroad's territory and test shipments
of low-sulfur Western coal to utilities in the Midwest and
East concerned about more stringent air pollution standards.
He added that Burlington Northern benefited from higher
shipments of corn to West Coast ports from the Midwest.
   CSX Corp., the only member of the group to disclose
results, reported last week that second-quarter net income
dropped 28%. However, CSX's earnings from continuing
operations rose 20%, reflecting improved results at rail,
barging and container shipping units.
   Analysts said that they expect Consolidated Rail Corp. to
post moderately higher earnings but that per-share earnings
for Union Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. will be
flat.
   Some analysts say rail operations were disappointing at
Santa Fe Pacific Corp., which faces tough competition for
freight from trucks and other railroads. Estimates of Santa
Fe's second-quarter earnings range from nil to two cents a
share. In the 1989 quarter, Santa Fe had net of $2.7 million,
or two cents a share. A Santa Fe spokesman wouldn't comment
on analysts' projections.
   Rail carloadings at the major railroads were up 1.3%,
according to the Association of American Railroads. Shipments
of coal rose 5.8%, chemicals were up 3.6%, and metals
increased 3.2%. Grain carloads were off about half a percent.
Carloadings of some higher-value freight were down, with
motor vehicles declining 4%, lumber 8.3% and paper less than
1%.
   Some analysts were cheered by the overall traffic gain.
"At this time a year ago tonnage was sliding, but now tonnage
is improving," said Andras Petery, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   Michael Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said
he is encouraged by rail shipments of finished automobiles,
which improved toward the end of the second quarter after a
very weak beginning. However, Mr. Lloyd believes that the
improvement partly reflects inventory -- building in
anticipation of a strike by the United Auto Workers union,
whose contract expires in September.
   "I'm worried that the stocks of the railroads will respond
positively to near-term traffic trends, trapping investors
for possible disappointment this fall," Mr. Lloyd said.
   When CSX reported that second-quarter net dropped to $109
million from $151 million, CSX said that earnings in the 1989
second period were inflated by gains from the sale of
subsidiaries. CSX said rail pretax operating profit rose
7.8%, reflecting improved coal tonnage that offset the extra
expense of an expanded locomotive repair program. Auto
traffic, while not reaching levels of the year-ago quarter,
improved sharply from the first period of 1990, the company
said. CSX said operating profit rose 40% at its
container-shipping unit, Sea-Land Service Inc., while
operating profit jumped 25% at the barge unit, reflecting
strong coal shipments and expanded operations at the marine
construction division.
   Some analysts expect Conrail to report second-quarter net
income of $1.30 to $1.40 a share compared with net of $1.19 a
share a year ago. One analyst said second-quarter results
included an after-tax gain of about 21 cents a share from
sale of a branch line. Conrail officials wouldn't comment on
analysts' estimates other than to say that traffic levels are
"relatively flat."
   Union Pacific officials said per-share earnings were about
the same as the $1.41 a share earned in the 1989 second
period, but net income fell slightly, reflecting higher
interest expense related to a share-repurchase program. The
officials cited earnings improvements at its rail, truck,
hazardous waste and real estate units. The officials said
earnings of the company's oil and gas unit won't match
after-tax earnings of $55 million in the year-ago quarter,
which included a $17 million gain on gas contract
settlements. Higher gas volumes in the recent quarter offset
price declines in oil and gas and flat oil volumes, the
officials said.
   They added that the rail unit benefited from a 1%
improvement in carloadings and a reduction in railroad work
force to 31,500 from 32,800 a year ago.
   Norfolk Southern wouldn't comment on analysts' projections
that net income was flat at 99 cents a share.
