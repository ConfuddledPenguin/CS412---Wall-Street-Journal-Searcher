   TORONTO -- When Michael DeGroote bought Laidlaw Inc. in
1959, it was a small trucking company, with 20 vehicles and
one customer.
   By the time, late last month, that Mr. DeGroote announced
his plans to retire, he had built Laidlaw into North
America's largest school bus operator and second-largest
hazardous waste management company. Laidlaw, based in
Burlington, Ontario, expects to post $2 billion in revenue in
its current fiscal year, up from $1.4 billion in the year
ended Aug. 31, 1989.

   Mr. DeGroote plans to hand over the reins of the company
to Donald Jackson, Laidlaw's newly arrived president.
Although Mr. Jackson hasn't been appointed chief executive,
Laidlaw officials say he will be in control of the company. A
chairman is expected to be named before the end of the year,
when Mr. DeGroote steps down from that post.
   "For thirty years, Mike DeGroote and Laidlaw have been
synonymous," said William Genco, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. "It's not exactly easy to replace a
legend. Those are big shoes to fill."
   The move stunned the investment community, although Mr.
DeGroote had given early warning of his intentions in 1988,
when he sold voting control of Laidlaw to Canadian Pacific
Ltd. On the day of the announcement last month, nervous
investors traded more than seven million Laidlaw shares.
Laidlaw's Class B shares fell 38 cents a share in national
over-the-counter trading to close at $21.75 a share.
   While the share price has bounced back to $23.375 Friday,
investors and analysts are keeping a careful eye on Mr.
DeGroote's hand-picked successor. Mr. Jackson, who joined the
company only last summer, now faces a dual challenge. He must
continue Laidlaw's strategy of growth through acquisitions
and oversee its transition to a large multinational concern
without losing the company's entrepreneurial style.
   "I come with some entrepreneurial skills and background,
but also with some formal education and a knowledge of the
major industrial players in the field," said Mr. Jackson. "I
want to blend Laidlaw's historical strength, its
entrepreneurial skills, with the management skills that are
needed to oversee its transition to a global enterprise."
   Mr. Jackson is no stranger to the two industries in which
Laidlaw is a major player -- transportation and hazardous
waste treatment and disposal.
   A graduate of the University of Western Ontario's master
of business administration program, he founded his own
company, Rentway Canada Ltd., in 1967. Two years later, both
Mr. Jackson and his company were snapped up by Calgary-based
Trimac Ltd., a holding company with interests in
transportation, waste disposal services and oil-field
services.
   In 1973, Trimac handed Mr. Jackson the task of building up
a new chemical waste concern, Tricil Ltd., in a joint venture
partnership with C-I-L Inc. C-I-L has since become the
Canadian unit of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC of Britain.
   "Trimac and C-I-L each put in $2 million," Mr. Jackson
said. "We grew the company . . . through acquisitions until
it was sold last December for a total of $240 million."
   In the 1970s and 1980s, Messrs. DeGroote and Jackson found
their companies competing head-to-head as both moved into the
burgeoning hazardous waste disposal business.
   "He was a very tough competitor, a very good negotiator,"
Mr. DeGroote says of Mr. Jackson.
   Mr. DeGroote recalls one contract, in Hamilton, Ontario,
where Laidlaw was then based. "We were sure that we totally
had it in the bag. But Tricil got it, with a competitive
price and what the clients described as an exceptionally
professional presentation. That one hurt."
   Eventually, Trimac asked Mr. Jackson to find a buyer for
its 50% stake in Tricil, and a deal was struck with Laidlaw.
After a three-year court battle between Trimac and C-I-L,
Laidlaw completed the $240 million acquisition in December.
But Mr. Jackson had left Trimac in 1987, and has launched a
suit against Trimac, alleging breach of contract and seeking
damages of 16.8 million Canadian dollars (US$14.5 million).
   In a countersuit in the Court of Queen's Bench in Alberta,
Trimac is seeking C$20 million in damages, alleging that Mr.
Jackson acted improperly in the Tricil negotiations.
   Laidlaw watchers say the company is likely to undergo some
significant changes as it continues to grow and Mr. Jackson
puts his own stamp on the organization.
   "Clearly, there's going to be more of an emphasis put on
the hazardous waste side of the business, given his
background at Tricil," said Steve Garmaise, vice president of
Toronto-based First Marathon Securities Ltd.
   Mr. Jackson agrees that Laidlaw is likely to make further
investments in the hazardous waste industry under his
leadership.
   "That's where the opportunities are, that's the fast
growth sector," he said, noting that about 60% of Laidlaw's
revenues and 70% of its net income come from that business.
   But Mr. Jackson sees his main contribution to Laidlaw as
"providing the management skills that are appropriate to the
running of a $2 billion company.
   "Entrepreneurship is what built the company, but if that's
all we have, we run the risk of building a foundation that
doesn't support that growth," he added.
   Mr. Garmaise and other analysts agree that Laidlaw needs a
more formal management structure, given its size and growing
complexity.
   "This is no longer a company where everything can be
overseen by one man," Mr. Garmaise said. "It needs more
structured reporting, cost controls and so on," He said this
is particularly true of Laidlaw's school bus business, hit by
shrinking margins. Mr. Jackson describes performance
improvements there as "a priority."
   Perhaps the biggest challenge confronting any successor to
Mr. DeGroote will be reassuring the investment community that
there will be no upheavals at Laidlaw as a result of the
management changes.
   "Changes can cause a temporary loss of momentum at a
high-growth company," said Merrill Lynch's Mr. Genco.
   Mr. Garmaise points to the different personal styles of
Messrs. DeGroote and Jackson.
   "Everyone at Laidlaw used to talk like truck drivers:
casual, slangy, no long words, because that's how Mike
talks," he said. "If you were educated, you didn't want to
appear too educated. Don strikes me as a much more polished
person, who thinks carefully before he speaks."
   But Mr. Jackson plays down any talk of a culture clash
with Laidlaw's freewheeling managers.
   "The company has grown through integrating acquisitions
and new people," he said. "There's much more tolerance for
newcomers than the average outfit, as long as you show you
can do the job. I felt at home here after my first two
weeks."
