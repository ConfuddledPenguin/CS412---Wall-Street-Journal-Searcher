   CHICAGO -- St. Paul Bancorp Inc. reported a loss of $20.8
million, or $1.72 a share, for the second quarter after the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision ordered its primary
subsidiary to increase loan-loss reserves.
   The thrift said the added reserves don't relate to any new
specific loan problems but instead reflect more stringent
standards. St. Paul said it disagrees with the regulators'
ruling and retains the right to seek arbitration of the
additional $26 million general reserve ordered for its St.
Paul Federal Bank for Savings unit.

   In the year-earlier quarter, St. Paul posted net income of
$5.4 million, or 45 cents a share.
   The company also said it agreed with thrift regulators to
confine future multifamily lending to Illinois or within 100
miles of its Chicago home office, and to reduce the
concentration of such loans secured by property outside
Illinois. Previously, St. Paul had been a significant lender
in California as part of a nationwide business strategy.
   As a result, St. Paul said its bank's loan-origination
volumes are expected to decrease significantly. Separately,
St. Paul said it is re-evaluating its policies on possible
mergers and acquisitions. "We've become more cautious," a
spokesman said.
