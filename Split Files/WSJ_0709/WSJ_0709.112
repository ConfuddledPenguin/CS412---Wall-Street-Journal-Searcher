   NEW YORK -- The dollar isn't expected to get much of a
lift from the dashing of expectations for an imminent Federal
Reserve easing of credit.
   Because U.S. economic growth still pales in comparison to
that of West Germany and Japan, and the Fed is still expected
to loosen credit at some point this summer, many currency
analysts and traders don't see the dollar strengthening much
soon.

   "Traders would still like to sell" the dollar, says Simon
Fischer, a trader at Algemene Bank Nederland N.V., New York.
   When dealings ended here late Friday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.6520 marks and 151.70 yen, compared with 1.6517
marks and 150.60 yen at Thursday's close. On the week, the
dollar was down from 1.6610 marks and 152.20 yen.
   In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 151.50
yen soon after the opening, up from Friday's Tokyo close of
150.95 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
1.6535 marks, up slightly from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6522
marks.
   The rickety dollar was boosted Friday by news about
unexpected strength in June U.S. employment data.
   The civilian jobless rate declined to 5.2% from 5.3% in
May, defying forecasts for an increase to a 5.4% rate. Also,
because of a Labor Department underestimation in the 1990
census worker count, the rise in May non-farm payrolls was
revised sharply to 355,000 from the original estimate of
164,000.
   Those dollar-supportive data overshadowed news about the
unexpectedly small 40,000 non-farm payrolls increase in June
and the 30,000 drop in manufacturing jobs last month.
   The dollar declined early last week on continued talk that
an accord to reduce the huge federal budget deficit would
prompt the Fed to loosen credit.
   But with signs of life in the employment report, analysts
now say any easing may be a ways off. The monthly employment
reports are seen as the best single measure of the economy's
health.
   Despite the Bush administration's squawking that high U.S.
interest rates are choking the economy, Federal Reserve
officials are apparently "pretty pleased with the balance
they have" between economic growth and inflation, says David
Stewart, an economist at Lloyds Bank.
   Mr. Stewart and other economists say the Fed probably will
continue to go through economic reports with a fine-toothed
comb before adjusting its policy, including the June producer
price index and retail sales data due Friday.
   The dollar strengthened against most major foreign
currencies Friday as the U.S. bond market was roiled by the
employment data. Treasury bonds fell more than a point, or
more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
   The Federal Reserve's execution of $2 billion customer
repurchase agreements Friday was viewed as a confirmation
that it didn't immediately alter its monetary policy because
of the employment data. Although that action added reserves
to the banking system, analysts say the move was a technical
one that had no policy implications.
   The Fed's intentions are expected to become clearer when
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan gives on July 18 his semiannual
testimony on monetary policy as required under the 1978
Humphrey-Hawkins law.
   Bearish traders say the Fed's steady stance isn't very
encouraging with U.S. economic growth lagging behind growth
in Japan and West Germany.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
forecasts that the U.S. economy will grow at an
inflation-adjusted 2.3% this year, much slower than
anticipated rates of 4.7% in Japan and 4% in West Germany.
   Just because the Fed is leaving U.S. rates alone, traders
"can't rush to buy dollars on that basis," says Mr. Fischer
of Algemene Bank Nederland.
   Global interest rates suggest that odds are stacked
against the dollar because the Fed is still expected to ease
at some point down the road, while the Bank of Japan and the
Bundesbank may have leeway to tighten credit if inflation
becomes problematic in Japan and West Germany.
   Many currency analysts don't see the dollar rising far
above current levels in the short run. On the other hand, the
dollar isn't expected to fall very far unless important
support around 1.65 marks and 150 yen crumbles.
   "We've noticed customers interested in buying the dollar
at these low levels, say, below 1.65" marks, says Thomas
Benfer, a foreign exchange marketing representative at Bank
of Montreal, New York.
   While the dollar may remain firm against the mark and the
yen, it could sink more against the soaring British pound.
The pound has risen to its highest levels in more than a year
because of Britain's relatively high interest rates and
speculation that it will soon be subject to the discipline of
the European Monetary System.
   Late Friday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7860,
up 0.45 cent from late Thursday and nearly four cents from a
week earlier.
   If pound buying keeps going at the recent rate, resistance
at $1.80 will be easily surpassed this week, says Mr.
Fischer.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$359.75 an ounce.
