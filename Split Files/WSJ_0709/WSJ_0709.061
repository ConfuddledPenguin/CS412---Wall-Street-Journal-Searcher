   DEKALB, Ill -- DeKalb Genetics Corp. expects to report
tomorrow that an unexpectedly large Argentine currency loss
will reduce its net income for the third quarter ended May 31
to less than half of the year-earlier quarter, Bruce P.
Bickner, DeKalb Genetics chairman and chief executive
officer, said.
   That prediction indicates that DeKalb Genetic's fiscal
third-quarter net income will be less than $2.4 million, or
43 cents a share.

   In the 1989 fiscal third quarter, the agricultural seed,
poultry and swine breeding concern generated net income of
$4.8 million, or 85 cents a share, on revenues of $83.8
million. Mr. Bickner said the company expects to report flat
revenues for the most recent third quarter.
   DeKalb Genetics, which sells seed to corn, sorghum and
sunflower farmers in Argentina, was stung by the government's
actions there to curb inflation.
   Before the government's campaign, the company had hedged
some of its receivables in anticipation that the austral, the
Argentine currency, would continue to devalue. But the
government's action resulted in the austral strengthening
against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, soaring interest rates
increased the expense of the loan the company had taken to
finance its hedge. As a result, the company expects to report
that its third-quarter interest expense increased
significantly from the year-earlier period.
   The company said it is taking steps to reduce its exposure
to additional currency losses, but that it isn't clear how
long that will take. "The fluctuation in Argentina will
continue to be a problem," said Richard O. Ryan, president of
DeKalb Genetics.
   Because of the drop in third-quarter net income, DeKalb
Genetic's earnings for the year ending Aug. 31 will probably
fall below Wall Street expectations. The fourth quarter
usually isn't a significant period for seed companies such as
DeKalb Genetics, which sell most of their products in the
winter and spring.
   Mr. Bickner said the company expects its net income for
the full year to rise about 15% from the $12.1 million, or
$2.14 a share generated for fiscal 1989.
   That forecast indicates that the company is on the track
to report fiscal 1990 net income of about $2.45 a share. In
the spring, some Wall Street analysts had been expecting the
company to generate fiscal 1990 net income of as much as
$2.90 a share.
   In the U.S., the third quarter ended May 31 is often the
period when seed sales peak. However, this year at DeKalb
Genetics a larger-than-normal proportion of U.S. seed sales
occurred in the second quarter ended Feb. 28, Mr. Bickner
said.
   As a result of this shift, the company's third-quarter
revenues from sales of corn and soybean seeds, among other
things, dropped about 15% from the 1989 third quarter.
   However, total seed sales in the U.S. for the second and
third quarters combined are running ahead of the 1989 pace,
Mr. Bickner said.
   Among other things, U.S. sales of corn seed are expected
to be up 5% from 1989, he said. Mr. Bickner added that the
company's market share of U.S. corn seed probably increased
slightly to more than 9% amid some of the toughest
promotional activity in the industry in several years.
   Price discounting was intense in part because an unusually
wet spring delayed planting for so long that corn farmers had
to trim their plans. As a result, many seed companies expect
to see a higher-than-normal proportion of seed returned to
them by their dealers. Farmers usually won't use seed that
was held over from a planting season until it is retested for
its ability to germinate.
   DeKalb Genetics's weakest-performing seed line this season
has been sorghum. Its supply of sorghum seed was tight
because an October frost reduced the yield of fields it had
planned to have harvested in Texas and Kansas. A few months
later, a freeze damaged its sorghum-seed producing fields in
Florida.
   Mr. Ryan said the company's swine breeding business should
benefit from the trend among farmers to begin expanding their
hog herds. Because of a tight supply of hogs fat enough for
slaughter, the price of hog this spring at times soared about
50% above year earlier levels. Sales of breeding stock in the
third quarter jumped 37% from the same 1989 quarter, he said.
   About 65% of DeKalb Genetic's closely held Class A common
stock, which has voting rights, is controlled by descendants
of the company's founder, Thomas H. Roberts Sr. The company
issues nonvoting Class B common shares to the public.
   In national over-the-counter trading on Friday, DeKalb
Class B shares closed at $43.50, up 50 cents.
