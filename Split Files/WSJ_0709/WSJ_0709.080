   The market pros featured in the Journal's Investment
Dartboard column have chalked up an impressive-looking
performance record since the stock-picking competition began
in October 1988.
   In a series of one-month contests, the pros' picks
outperformed a random "dartboard portfolio" -- selected by
Journal staffers heaving darts at the stock pages -- 15 times
out of 20.

   But a careful study of the results indicates that the
achievement isn't as great as it appears. Much, if not all,
of the pros' edge seems to reflect a "publicity effect," as
readers rushing to buy the featured stocks bid up the prices.
   To minimize the impact of the publicity effect and make
the contest more meaningful, the battle of the pros against
the flying darts will henceforth measure the results on a
six-month basis. That will provide ample time for the
publicity effect to dissipate and make the outcome a better
reflection of stock-picking ability.
   With the permission and encouragement of the Journal,
Douglas Loeffler, senior quantitative analyst at the money
management firm Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, studied several
aspects of the contest, including the publicity effect. His
method differed in some respects from that used in the
column. For example, instead of the dartboard portfolio, he
used the New York Stock Exchange Index as a comparison point.
   Mr. Loeffler found that the pros' successes, measured over
a one-month period, were to a large extent self-fulfilling
prophecy.
   On publication days, he found, stocks featured in the
Investment Dartboard column rose an average of nearly 3.5
percentage points relative to the Big Board index. On the two
following days, they rose some more; this "after-effect"
started out as about one percentage point but has grown over
time to more than two percentage points. In stock market
studies, differences of this magnitude are considered quite
large.
   After the surge, the stocks gravitated back toward the
mean. They slightly underperformed the exchange's index for
the remainder of the month, ending about 3.5 percentage
points ahead of the index.
   That means that readers couldn't achieve big gains by
buying the stocks recommended by the contestants. If they
bought the day after publication or later, they would do no
better than the market. This was true both for one-month and
six-month periods, Mr. Loeffler found.
   Readers who bought the featured stocks on publication day
might have beaten the market modestly. But the possible gain
from such a tactic falls short of the 3.5 percentage-point
outperformance credited to the pros, because most readers
would have to buy the stocks for a price higher than the
previous day's close. Also, the readers would have to pay
commissions to buy and sell.
   Until now, the column has measured results from month's
end to month's end, regardless of the day the article was
published. Thus, the gains theoretically achieved by the pros
were much greater than any gains a reader could achieve by
following the pros' advice.
   "If one buys all of the recommended stocks at the closing
price on publication day, the results are a broker's dream
and an investor's nightmare," Mr. Loeffler wrote. "Even
without transaction costs, the results for the 20-month
period are pathetic. The investor could have done much better
in T-bills." His conclusion: "Don't try this at home."
   No special trend was observed in the days preceding
publication, indicating that the contestants didn't try to
take advantage of the publicity effect to make money for
themselves or clients. The pros' picks rose, on average, in
three of the five prepublication trading sessions, but not to
a statistically significant degree.
   Contrary to what some people had predicted, the pros'
picks, as a group, weren't especially risky or volatile.
Their "beta," a measure of volatility, was only slightly
greater than that of the average stock.
   That there was a publicity effect came as no surprise. The
very first Investment Dartboard column mentioned that such an
effect was expected. But the effect was larger than
anticipated, was growing and was affecting the outcome of the
contest. Had the Journal measured results from the close of
trading on the day the article appeared (eliminating most of
the publicity effect), the pros would have beaten the market
only half the time.
   Starting with this month's column, each Dartboard contest
will illustrate the results achieved by the four investment
pros who made selections six months earlier. The two who did
best over that period will be invited back for another try.
   In addition to providing more time for the publicity
effect to wear off, making the pros-vs.-darts battle more
even, the longer period should also make the contest among
the pros themselves a bit more fair. Because small stocks
tend to be more sensitive to publicity than large ones,
contestants who picked small stocks had an edge in a
one-month comparison. (However, this factor alone didn't
determine the outcome: Some big stocks have won, and some
small stocks have fallen on their faces.)
   The debate over whether any group of market professionals
can consistently outperform the stock market averages has
simmered for at least three decades. The "efficient market
theory," also known as the "random walk theory," says that
outperformance is basically a matter of luck.
   According to this theory, which is held by many academic
students of the market, all known information is factored
into stock prices almost instantaneously. Therefore, only
unknown factors can move stock prices. This being the case,
an amateur -- or a monkey throwing darts -- can pick stocks
as well as the pros.
   Needless to say, the theory is unpopular on Wall Street,
where brokerage houses and money managers make their living
by persuading clients that they have superior knowledge or
insight into what the market will do and which stocks will
perform best.
   Burton Malkiel, a Princeton University economics
professor, popularized the efficient market theory in his
book, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," first published in
1973. Mr. Malkiel threw out the first dart for the column's
contest in the fall of 1988.
   The idea behind the column was to make a modest
contribution to the debate and provide a source of investment
ideas for individuals -- plus a little fun, to boot.
   The first Dartboard column said: In the real world, of
course, no serious investor bets everything on a single
stock. And Mr. Malkiel notes that Investment Dartboard isn't
a fair test of the efficient market theory, because of the
small number of stocks involved and because a "publicity
effect" might make stocks highlighted in this space perform
better than others, at least temporarily.
   Mr. Malkiel couldn't be reached for comment on this
article. But for the record, he was right.
