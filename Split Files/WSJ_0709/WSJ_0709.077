   Sun Sportswear Inc., Kent, Wash., one of the nation's
largest screen-printers of casual sportswear sold in discount
retail stores, said cool spring weather caused second-quarter
sales to drop between 9% and 12% to an estimated $22 million
to $23 million from $25.1 million a year earlier.
   Officials attributed the poor performance to slowing
orders and an inventory buildup. Earnings and sales data
won't be available until the end of the month, a spokeswoman
said. But, reflecting the sales slump, Sun Sportswear shares
plunged $1.25, to close at $8.25, in national
over-the-counter trading Friday.
