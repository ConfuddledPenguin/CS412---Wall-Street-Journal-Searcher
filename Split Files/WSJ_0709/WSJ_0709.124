   Draws Little Protest

   WASHINGTON -- A $4 billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia
has moved through Congress with barely a protest from
Israel's allies -- the latest symptom of erosion of support
on Capitol Hill for the Jewish state.
   Until recently, pro-Israel forces routinely opposed most
arms sales to Arab governments, or at least sought to have
them scaled back. But pro-Israel activists now say they must
choose more selectively which battles to fight. They say the
refusal by Israel's right-wing government to pursue its own
Mideast peace plan, and increasing resentment among lawmakers
about strong-arm tactics by pro-Israel lobbyists, have
poisoned the atmosphere.

   This new hesitancy sometimes produces confusion. Indeed,
during the past few weeks, the vaunted pro-Israel political
machine has seemed to be in disarray.
   The Israeli Embassy, for instance, waited several weeks
after the Saudi sale was announced before even stating
forcefully that the arms package would threaten Israel's
security. The major pro-Israel lobbying group, Aipac, taking
its cue from the embassy's initial reticence, decided it
wouldn't fight the sale.
   One congressman who opposed the arms package was told by
more than 30 congressional offices there was no reason to
join the fight if Aipac was silent. In the end, the proposed
House resolution to block the sale had only 10 sponsors.
   Aipac says it didn't put up a fight because the arms
wouldn't jeopardize Israel's security. It took a similar
approach last fall, when the administration proposed a tank
sale to Saudi Arabia. An official says the group is "keeping
its powder dry" to wage a big battle against an expected
attempt by the Saudis to make a major purchase of fighter
aircraft. "You can't ask Congress to go to the mat for every
weapon {sale}," the official says. "You've got to have a
strategy."
   But an Israeli official offers a different view: "A lot of
people realize that we now have a limited amount of political
capital in this town."
   The pending Saudi arms package includes about 1,100
light-armored vehicles, improvements for Awacs electronic
surveillance aircraft and 2,000 TOW anti-tank missiles.
Israeli officials say the first two items, which make up the
bulk of the sale, wouldn't pose a military threat to Israel.
But the TOW missiles are designed to penetrate a type of
armor used on Israeli tanks.
   At the behest of pro-Israel legislators, House Foreign
Affairs Chairman Rep. Dante Fascell (D., Fla.), and Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the panel's Mideast
subcommittee, spoke to Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger about removing the TOWs from the package. But the
effort failed, as the pro-Israel forces had little leverage.
   That's especially surprising in view of the fact that the
administration's reasons for arms sales to the Saudis have
been very disjointed recently. Last year, the administration
told Congress that Saudi Arabia needed tanks because of a
threat from Iraq. In a hearing last month, the administration
said Saudi Arabia needed the latest arms package because it
faces "a significant threat from Iran." But during
questioning at the hearing, an administration official said
"Iran has taken a beating in the {Iran-Iraq} war and is not
at this point an overwhelming military threat."
   Congressional resentment has been growing against
pro-Israel forces for some time. The Israel lobby engendered
considerable congressional ire earlier this year by pushing a
purely symbolic, nonbinding resolution declaring that
Jerusalem is Israel's capital. Lawmakers adopted it
overwhelmingly, but, concedes an Israeli official, "Probably
a lot of good will for Israel was wasted in the process."
   Congress also resented a secret effort by Israel's
government earlier this year to help finance the takeover of
a building by Jewish hard-liners in the Old Christian quarter
of East Jerusalem. As a slap on the wrist, the House added
$1.8 million -- the amount secretly provided for the takeover
-- to a fee charged Israel for a U.S. loan guarantee. When
the fee was added, even pro-Israel House members didn't
object.
   "We're all learning there's a bottom to the well," says an
Israeli official. "People won't be pressed."
