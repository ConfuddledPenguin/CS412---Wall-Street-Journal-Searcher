   WASHINGTON -- President Bush will permit, for the first
time, U.S. commercial satellites to be launched by Soviet
rockets, Secretary of State James Baker said.
   Speaking on ABC-News' "This Week" program yesterday, Mr.
Baker said he didn't know when the first American satellite
would be carried by a Soviet rocket, which would be launched
from Australia, but that the president had decided "an
initial launch can go forward." The president's decision was
first reported by the New York Times.

   American rocket companies have opposed the competition
that allowing U.S. satellites on Soviet rockets would bring.
But the Soviets offer services to U.S. satellite companies at
prices the companies feel they should take advantage of to
stay competitive.
   Meanwhile, USBI Co., a unit of United Technologies Corp.,
reportedly is in line to receive an export license from the
State Department to operate the Australian space port. Andrea
Shea-King, a USBI spokeswoman, confirmed yesterday that
United Technologies has been involved in studying and
planning the initiative for about three years. But she added
that United Technologies has yet to be notified about the
license approval.
   USBI, with operations in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and
Huntsville, Ala., is a major contractor to NASA for the Space
Shuttle program. Mrs. Shea-King said United Technologies was
one of three aerospace giants invited by the Australians to
submit proposals, although she added that she didn't know the
identity of the rivals. "To my knowledge, we are the only
entity in the running now," she said.
   While declining to provide details, the spokeswoman said
any forthcoming contract to serve as the program manager in
Australia would "have a significant financial" impact for the
company.
