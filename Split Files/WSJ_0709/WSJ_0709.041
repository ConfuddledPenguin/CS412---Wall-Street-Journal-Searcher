   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. -- For the fourth year in a row,
Acura, the luxury car division of Honda Motor Co. of Japan,
topped the customer satisfaction index of J.D. Power &amp;
Associates, an auto market research concern.
   Mercedes-Benz AG of West Germany, a unit of Daimler-Benz
AG, Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan, Detroit-based General Motors
Corp.'s Cadillac and Honda had the other top-ranked
nameplates in the index, which is used by car companies in
marketing campaigns.

   The index is based on a survey of owners of new autos
about their level of satisfaction with their vehicles and
dealers after a full year of ownership; this standard ruled
out consideration of two new luxury cars, Toyota's Lexus and
Japan-based Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti.
   GM's Buick was the only other domestic nameplate in the
top nine besides Cadillac, though Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford
Motor Co.'s Mercury and Lincoln made big jumps from a year
ago. Five of the top nine spots were grabbed by Japanese
companies; two spots were taken by German luxury nameplates.
   The customer satisfaction index is different from the
initial quality survey, released last week by J.D. Power. The
initial quality survey, which measures defects reported by
owners during their first 90 days of ownership, tends to have
a greater effect on sales of specific models.
