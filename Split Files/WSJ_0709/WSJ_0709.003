   JOHANNESBURG -- The South African government decided to
assist the troubled gold mine East Rand Proprietary Mines
Ltd., which was threatened with possible closure and the loss
of about 10,000 jobs because of the low price of gold.
   East Rand, which is managed by the mining house Rand Mines
Ltd., recently applied to the government for further
assistance, as its working cost of about 1,300 rand ($491) to
produce an ounce of gold produced far exceeds the market
price of about 950 rand an ounce.

   East Rand is 30%-owned by Rand Mines, with the bulk of its
shareholders in France and Belgium.
   The acting minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs and
Public Enterprises, Barend Du Plessis, said last week that
the commission that inquired into the desirability of
continued financial support for the mine recommended it
continue operating.
   "In view of the substantial financial commitments which
the state has already made to ERPM, and in view of the
socioeconomic implications of the mine, it is recommended
that the state join with Rand Mines Ltd. and First National
Bank in providing further financial assistance to ERPM," Mr.
Du Plessis said. "This will enable the mine to complete this
drastic reorganization and to continue its operations on the
rationalized basis submitted to the commission."
   The additional financial assistance will consist of a
further loan by Rand Mines and the deferral of certain
interest on existing loans by First National Bank and Rand
Mines until these are repaid. The amount of the new loan
wasn't disclosed.
   A total of 300 million rand ($113.4 million) in government
and bank guaranteed loans previously was made available to
the mine. State aid to the mine now consists of a guaranteed
loan of 220 million rand, including a provision for an
interest subsidy on the bulk of the loan, with the remainder
being interest-free.
