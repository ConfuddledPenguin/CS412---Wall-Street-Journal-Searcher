   Nov. 15-17, 1975, Chateau de Rambouillet, France

   Participants: Gerald Ford, Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
Helmut Schmidt, Aldo Moro, Takeo Miki, Harold Wilson
   Main Subjects: Stimulating economic growth in the light of
the recession that had begun in late 1973; inflation;
quadrupling of oil prices and the problem of future supplies;
unemployment
   Declarations: To promote economic recovery and reduce high
unemployment and inflation; reduce dependence on imported
energy; commit to an open trading system and complete
trade-liberalization talks
   Outcome: The meeting helped boost international confidence
and brought about a rapprochement between the U.S. and France
over the international exchange-rate system. International
trade talks continued, and the West gradually pulled out of
the recession. But inflation, unemployment and energy
supplies continued to be serious problems.

   June 27-28, 1976, Dorodo Beach, Puerto Rico
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Gerald Ford, Pierre Trudard, Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, Helmut Schmidt, Aldo Moro, Takeo Miki and James
Callaghan
   Main Subjects: The search for policies to sustain economic
expansion; new financial mechanisms to help countries with
balance-of-payments problems, particularly Italy;
international trade talks
   Declarations: To sustain economic recovery and reduce high
unemployment; to seek more balanced fiscal and monetary
policies; to complete multilateral trade talks, the so-called
Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), by the end of 1977; to avoid imposition of further
tariffs
   Outcome: Better coordination and cooperation between
summit countries helped to foster more orderly
foreign-exchange markets. Trade talks continued, bu the GATT
round didn't finish until 1978-79. The EC Commission
president was henceforth included in summit meetings.

   May 7-8, 1977, London, England
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Jimmy Carter, Pierre Trudeau, Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, Helmut Schmidt, Giulio Andreotti, Takeo Fukuda,
James Callaghan, Roy Jenkins
   Main Subjects: Unemployment and inflation; additional
resources for the IMF; problems of energy supply
   Declarations: Recognized need to increase nuclear energy
to help meet world requirements; to continue constructive
dialogue with developing countries to increase flow of aid
and resources; West Germany committed to 5% economic growth
in 1977 to help pull the world economy further out of
recession
   Outcome: Nuclear programs in some summit countries,
particularly France, got a further boost. More discussions
took place with developing country leaders in forums such as
the Conference on International Economic Cooperation. West
Germany's economy grew by 2.4% in 1977.

   July 16-17 1978 Bonn, West Germany
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Jimmy Carter, Pierre Trudeau, Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, Helmut Schmidt, Giulio Andreotti, Takeo Fukuda,
James Callaghan, Roy Jenkins
   Main Subjects: Reducing U.S. oil imports; shoring up the
slumping dollar; complaints that Japan and West Germany
needed to do mroe to stimulate their economies; the closer
linking of European, and particularly French and German,
currencies
   Declarations: West Germany and Japan pledged to do more to
stimulate their economies; most of the other countries
announced specific growth targets; trade negotiators were
directed to wrap up the GATT round by mid-December 1978
   Outcome: Few countries met their growth targets for 1979.
The GATT round was completed before the next summit meeting.

   June 28-29, 1979, Tokyo, Japan
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Jimmy Carter, Joe Clark, Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, Helmut Schmidt, Giulio Andreotti, Masayoshi Ohira,
Margaret Thatcher, Roy Jenkins
   Main Subjects: Oil supplies and the possibility of curbing
the West's oil imports; rising inflation
   Declarations: To restrict oil demand and oil imports; to
increase use of coal and expand alternative sources of
energy; assailed recent OPEC decisions to raise oil prices
   Outcome: The West succeeded in limiting its growing thirst
for oil imports, thanks to a burst of oil exploration,
conservation measures and the development of alternatives to
oil.

   June 22-23, 1980, Venice, Italy
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Jimmy Carter, Pierre Trudeau, Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, Helmut Schmidt, Francesco Cossiga, Saburo Okita,
Margaret Thatcher, Roy Jenkins
   Main Subjects: Inflation; energy; relations with
developing countries; monetary problems; trade
   Declarations: To reduce inflation was the "immediate top
priority"; to break the link between economic growth and oil
consumption during the 1980s; to further development of oil
substitution, exploration and conservation measures; to
double coal production by early 1990; to encourage the
international capital market to recycle funds from
oil-exporting coutnries to developing countries, supplemented
by a mroe active International Monetary Fund and World Bank;
to strengthen international arrangements on export credits,
particularly to reduce distortions in export competition
   Outcome: It wasn't until 1982 and the summit countries got
a grip on inflation. International banks continued to lend
ever larger sums to Latin Americ and other developing
countries with big payments deficits.

   July 20-21, 1981, Ottawa, Canada
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Pierre Trudeau, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Schmidt, Giovanni Spadolini, Zenko Suzuki,
Margaret Thatcher, Gaston Thorn
   Main Subjects: Sluggish world economy; high U.S. interest
rates; relations with developing countries; trade; energy;
East-West economic relations
   Declarations: Summiteers, shying away from earlier habit
of setting particular targets, stressed broad goals, such as
the need to spur economic growth by cutting inflation and
reducing public borrowing; stressed a commitment to "low and
stable monetary growth as essential to reducing inflation";
restated commitment to helping developing countries;
condemned the continued Soviet occupation of Afghanistan
   Outcome: The U.S. and Britain continued their experiments
with tight monetary policies as inflation continued to fall
in both countries. West Germany had more success with less
controversial monetary policies, and the U.S. failed to cut
public borrowing.

   June 4-5, 1982, Versailles, France
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Pierre Trudeau, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Schmidt, Giovanni Spadolini, Zenko Suzuki,
Margaret Thatcher, Gaston Thorn
   Main Subjects: High international interest rates and the
working ofthe international monetary system; Lebanon;
technology; employment and economic growth
   Declarations: To increase growth and employemtn; to pursue
prudent monetary policies and achieve greater control of
budgetary deficits; to resist trade-distorting practices and
protectionist pressures; to be cautious in financial
relations with the Soviet Union and its satellites,
particularly with regard to export credits
   Outcome: The contries treid to better harmonize their
economies. Within days, France and Italy devalued the franc
and liara against other European currencies. But the U.S.
remained reluctant to use much foreign-exchange market
intervention to address instabilities. The soviet and EAst
European economies continued to stagnate, and were hurt by
the summiteers' cautious attitude in extending further
credits.

   May 28-30, 1983, Williamsburg, Virginia
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Pierre Trudeau, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Amintore Fanfani, Yasuhiro Nakasone,
Margaret Thatcher, Gaston Thorn
   Main Subjects: Nurturing the economic recovery; reducing
interest rates, inflation and budget deficits; the growing
developing-country debt crisis
   Declarations: To cut government spending and slow the
steady growth in the money supply; to roll back recently
imposed trade barriers; affirmation of coordinated
foreign-exchange market intervention where needed; support
for developing countries battered by the international debt
crisis
   Outcome: The meeting helped boost confidence in the
growing world-wide economic recovery. But trade barriers and
the international debt problem are both still very much with
us seven years after Williamsburg.

   June 7-8, 1984, London, England
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Pierre Trudeau, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Bettino Craxi, Yasuhiro Nakasone,
Margaret Thatcher, Gaston Thorn
   Main Subjects: Public spending; employment; monetary
policy; international debt
   Declarations: To spread the benefits of the economic
recovery; to strengthen policies to cut high interest rates
and inflation; to control monetary growth and reduce budget
deficits; to maintain and increase official development
assistance; to continue with the current international debt
strategy
   Outcome: The economic recovery in industrialized countries
went on, with inflation and interest rates continuing to
decline. But problems with unemployment -- particularly in
Europe -- and with international debt continued to fester.

   May 2-4, 1985, Bonn, West Germany
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Pierre Trudeau, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Bettino Craxi, Yasuhiro Nakasone,
Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors
   Main Subjects: Economic growth and employment; relations
with developing countries; the multilaeral trading system;
the international monetary system; environmental policies;
cooperation in science and technology
   Declarations: To sustain economic growth, cut inflation
and raise employment through coordinated eocnomic policies;
endorsement of the U.S.-led international debt strategy; to
continue to help African countries racked by famine and
drought; to clamp down on drug trafficking; to commit to
specific national policies (the U.S., for instance promised
to pursue "a rapid and appreciable cut in its public
expenditures" and West Germany pledged to boost its economy)
   Outcome: Although most summit members wanted to begin a
new round of trade talks in 1986, the summit failed to set a
starting date. France said it first wanted to ensure that
such talks wouldn't be aimed at dismantling the EC's common
agricultural policy. West Germany and Japan largely ignored
U.S. suggestions that they should stimulate their economies
more. The U.S. and other summit countries succeeded in
slapping down French calls for an international monetary
conference.

   May 4-6, 1986, Tokyo, Japan
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Amintore Fanfani, Yasuhiro Nakasone,
Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors
   Main Subjects: Trade; international economic-policy
coordination; the U.S.-Japan economic relationship
   Declarations: To overhaul agricultural policies as part of
a bid to rewrite the world's trade treaty; reaffirmed a
commitment to non-inflationary growth, the environment and
other summit favorites; to cooperate more on fighting
international terrorism
   Outcome: The wrangle over agricultural policies continues
to this day. Following the summit, the Group of Seven, made
up of the earlier Group of five plus Canada and Italy, was
formed. The group was composed of finance ministers and
central-bank governors and has since been the Western world's
most powerful economic coordinating body.

   June 8-10, 1987, Venice, Italy
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Amintore Fanfani, Yasuhiro Nakasone,
Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors
   Main Subjects: Exchange rates; macroeconomic policies;
trade; agriculture; developing countries and debt;
environment; East-West relations; U.S. budget deficit
   Declarations: Accolades for Japan's $43 billion
growth-stimulating package; to follow up on the February
Louvre accord to stabilize the dollar and other currencies
"at current levels"; to make more progress on agricultural
reform
   Outcome: Japan did boost its economy, but it still hasn't
opened it up to the outside world as much as the other
summiteers hoped. The U.S. didn't get the total endorsement
it sought for its tough action to protect shipping in the
Arabian Gulf, and President Reagan didn't get the support he
wanted on arms control.

   June 19-21, 1988, Toronto, Canada

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Ciriaco de Mita, Noburu Takeshita,
Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors
   Main Subjects: Imbalances in the global economy;
macroeconomic policies and exchange rates; multilateral trade
talks; newly industrializing economies; developing countries
and debt; the environment
   Declarations: Strong support for Uraguay Round of GATT
talks, for the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and for the
European Community's move toward a single market by the end
of 1992; call for continued reform of agricultural policies,
particularly protectionist measures in developed countries;
pledge to give the poorest developing nations -- mostly in
sub-Saharan Africa -- more breaks in the form of further IMF,
World Bank and government credits, and through cuts in their
existing debts
   Outcome: More Western governmetns wrote off or made
concessions on loans to sub-Saharan Africa. The EC began to
make some limited efforts to cut back its huge agricultural
subsidies.

   July 14-16, 1989, Paris, France
                                                                                                       

   Participants: Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Ciriaco de Mita, Noburu Takeshita,
Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Delors
   Main Subjects: Eastern Europe; the Brady debt strategy;
the environment; Tiananmen Square massacre
   Declarations: To aid Poland and Hungary; to clean up the
world's air and waters; cautious response to Soviet proposal
to link up with the world's industrial economies; endorsement
of new U.S.-backed debt strategy that stressed cutting back
the bank debts and interest payments of developing countries;
call for futher reductions in the U.S. budget deficit;
condemnation of the massacre in Tiananmen Square
   Outcome: Western aid packages were put together for Poland
and Hungary and other states in Eastern Europe. But these
have tended to rely on trade privileges, technical help and
loans. The new debt strategy produced small cuts in the
foreign debt of Mexico and the Philippines. But private
credit to the debtors slowed from a trickle to a drip. China
was denied loans from summit countries for almost a year. The
U.S. still is wrestling with its federal budget deficit.
