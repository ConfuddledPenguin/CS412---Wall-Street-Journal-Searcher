   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Lead and zinc prices are
expected to jump this week as unionized workers at Cominco
Ltd., Canada's biggest producer of the metals, prepared to
strike today at 7 a.m. PDT.
   The expected walkout would shut down Cominco's big
lead-zinc smelter complex at Trail, British Columbia, which
at full capacity produces about 5.8% of the western world's
refined zinc, and about 2.6% of its refined lead.

   "The potential is for quite dramatic increases" of perhaps
several cents a pound for both lead and zinc, if there is a
lengthy walkout at the Trail complex, said Victor Lazarovici,
analyst with Toronto's BBN James Capel Inc. In London Metal
Exchange spot dealings Friday, lead closed at about 41 cents
(U.S.) per pound; zinc closed at 79 cents.
   "Physical supplies of the metals are still very tight,"
Mr. Lazarovici said, partly reflecting a continuing strike at
Brunswick Mining &amp; Smelting Corp.'s big lead-zinc mine at
Bathurst, New Brunswick, where about 1,100 unionized workers
have been off the job since July 1. Brunswick Mining is a
unit of Noranda Inc.
   At Cominco, contract talks broke off Saturday between
company bargainers and negotiators for the United
Steelworkers of America, which represents 2,900 workers at
Trail and 700 more at Cominco's currently dormant lead-zinc
mine at Kimberley, British Columbia. The previous pact
expired June 30.
   Union bargainers angrily dismissed Cominco's latest offer,
which called for annual wage increases of 7.3% and 3.6%,
respectively, over the life of a new two-year pact, as
inadequate. The proposed pay gains reflect an average hourly
wage of 16.82 Canadian dollars (US$14.47), under the previous
accord.
   Union officials, citing higher wage rates for British
Columbia's forestry workers, and for unionized workers at
Cominco's 50%-owned Highland Valley copper mine, said they
want to close the gap with an immediate pay boost of at least
14%. Union bargainers said they also want cost-of-living
allowance (COLA) payments to continue. Cominco, which made
such payments under the old pact, hasn't offered to restore
them.
   Cominco's spokeswoman said the union's contract demands
would add about C$120 million, or an average C$9.50 an hour,
to existing operating costs at Trail. "It's a level that
would shut us down. We just couldn't operate economically at
those levels," she said.
   Cominco's spokeswoman said the company began a three-day
shutdown of the Trail refinery complex Friday. "We have no
idea when talks will resume," she said.
   Union officials said the stage appears set for what could
be a bitter and protracted strike. If so, it wouldn't be the
first labor confrontation for Cominco, which has had a stormy
relationship with its unionized workers in recent years.
   Indeed, Cominco endured a four-month strike at Trail
during the last round of contract talks, in 1987, and its
contract with workers at Highland Valley was reached last
fall, after workers struck for three and a half months.
