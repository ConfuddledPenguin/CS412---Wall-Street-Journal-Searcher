   British Airways PLC ordered 21 Boeing Co. 747-400 jumbo
jetliners valued at about $3.8 billion, and took options for
12 others, which could bring the total value of the deal to
$6.4 billion.
   Deliveries under the order, which Seattle-based Boeing
described as its third-largest ever when options are
included, will begin in 1992 and would stretch through 1999.
In London, British Airways Chairman Lord King said the
airline's biggest order ever "will ensure that we have a
sufficient flow of 747-400 aircraft to meet the growth of our
intercontinental network" forecast for the 1990s and beyond.

   The firm order for 21 of the 386-passenger, long-range
planes -- plus British Airways' conversion of two options to
firm orders late last year -- would boost the airline's
747-400 fleet to 42, larger than that of any other carrier,
Boeing said. The planes will be powered by Rolls Royce
RB211524G engines. In 1986, British Airways ordered 19 of the
jetliners and took options for 12 more, including the two
that were converted to firm orders in December. The remaining
10 options are still outstanding. Were all its options
converted, the British Airways 747-400 fleet could swell to
64 by the end of the decade. British Airways already has
taken delivery of 13 747-400s from that 1986 order.
   British Airways said it had negotiated the right to
convert the 747-400s it ordered into any new variant of the
aircraft that Boeing might develop in the 1990s.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Boeing stock closed at $60.50, up $1.25 a share. British
Airways shares traded late Friday on London's Stock Exchange
at 211 pence, up 2 from Thursday.
   A spokeswoman for the airline confirmed it also is talking
with Boeing about a possible purchase of the aerospace
concern's proposed 767-X airliner, a new 350-seat plane it
hopes to launch as the 777. The spokeswoman said British
Airways also is talking with McDonnell Douglas Corp. about
its MD-11 aircraft and to European aircraft maker Airbus
Industrie about its A-330, which are much further along in
the development process.
   "All three options are being studied. All three are in
contention," she said, adding that the airline expects to
choose "very late" this year. She declined to say how many of
those planes British Airways plans to order.
   The 747-400 order brings Boeing's total orders so far this
year to 242 aircraft valued at $22.7 billion, the company
said. Last year at this time, the company had orders for 602
aircraft valued at $33.2 billion.
   Separately, Boeing said it expects to reduce its work
force in the state of Washington by about 2,700 during the
second half of the year, making the total 1990 reduction
about 5,600. Such a reduction would exceed by 600 the size of
the employment decline that Boeing had projected in January.
Reductions generally are related to a lower volume of
military work, Boeing said.
