   LONDON -- Associated British Foods PLC, or ABF, said it's
considering making an offer for British Sugar and other
food-manufacturing companies of Berisford International PLC,
the troubled United Kingdom food, financial-services,
property, commodities and industrial group.
   Berisford previously had said it was willing to sell any
part of its business to reduce its net debt of #1.02 billion
($1.82 billion). At the same time, the company reported a
sharp deterioration in net earnings attributable to
shareholders as a result of provisions taken against New York
property investments.

   ABF, which owns 23% of Berisford, said the only solution
open to Berisford is the early sale of its profitable British
Sugar unit. Analysts have estimated the sale of the sugar
operations could fetch as much as #1 billion.
   A spokesman for Berisford said the two companies had been
involved in talks for two weeks with a view to ABF making an
offer for all of Berisford. "There are several people who
have been discussing various things with Berisford," he said.
   He added that some of those involved in talks were foreign
companies.
   Harry Bailey, ABF's chief executive officer, said ABF
wants to "sit down and discuss" making an offer for British
Sugar that could also include Berisford's flavors,
fragrances, and fruits and nuts importing units as well as
businesses that are associated with British Sugar, like its
beat pulp unit.
   ABF said an early sale of British Sugar would allow
Berisford to realize optimum value for its remaining assets
and reduce the need for forced sales.
   Mr. Bailey said ABF had #1 billion in cash available for a
purchase, although he said that figure couldn't be used as an
indication of what ABF considered British Sugar to be worth.
   British Sugar is the main component of Berisford's Bristar
food and agribusiness division. In the six months ended March
31, British Sugar's profit before interest and taxes rose 19%
to #59.1 million from #49.6 million the year before.
Berisford's overall profit before interest dropped 21% to
#57.2 million from #72.6 million.
   In its latest results, ABF said pretax profit for the year
to March 31 jumped 20% to #284 million from #237 million and
earnings per share rose 18% to 14.67 pence from 12.4 pence.
