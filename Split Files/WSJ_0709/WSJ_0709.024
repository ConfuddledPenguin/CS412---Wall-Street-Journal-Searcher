   LONDON -- The U.S. and its allies have offered Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev a helping hand by agreeing to
overhaul the West's military structure, but they aren't
likely to agree this week to offer him an economic lifeline.
   Secretary of State James Baker reiterated over the weekend
that economic aid would be wasted unless certain conditions
-- such as a full commitment to free-market principles -- are
in place.

   Furthermore, in meetings before this week's economic
summit in Houston, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told
President Bush that Japan will oppose any aid until it
resolves a dispute with the Soviet Union over ownership of
four islands in the Kuril chain.
   At the end of their summit here last Friday, Mr. Bush and
other leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
endorsed a package of historic changes in the alliance's
military structure. They agreed, among other things, to use
nuclear arms only as a "last resort," to soon withdraw
American nuclear-tipped artillery shells from Europe and to
shrink the army in a newly united Germany.
   Those steps are designed to make NATO look less
threatening so that the Soviets will accept a united Germany
inside the Western alliance. They are intended also to allow
Mr. Gorbachev to tell his domestic critics that the West is
responding to his reform program.
   "I would think he could say, `We've been right to reach
out as we have tried to do to the United States and indeed to
improve relations with countries in Western Europe,'" Mr.
Bush told reporters after the NATO meeting.
   But Mr. Bush reiterated that the helping hand he is
offering Mr. Gorbachev won't hold any direct U.S. economic
aid, setting up a debate between the president and other
leaders of the seven industrialized countries who gather this
week in Houston for an economic summit.
   West Germany, in particular, is prepared to make an
impassioned argument that the West should give Mr. Gorbachev
immediate and direct economic help to ensure his political
survival.
   Mr. Bush said at the close of the NATO session that if the
Germans want to go ahead with aid, "that's their business."
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
had received a letter from Mr. Gorbachev, dated July 4, that
outlines steps Mr. Gorbachev has taken in the Soviet Union
and "asks the summit countries to consider providing
technical assistance and credits" to help his reform efforts.
   In his comments Friday Mr. Bush hinted that there could be
a crack in the door for aid to the Soviets. "Perhaps there
are ways that we can assist them as we go forward," he said,
"with credit or other matters, before we go to direct
government loans."
   Secretary Baker, appearing on ABC News' "This Week"
program yesterday, said that credits are "not right now in
the cards." But officials said the administration is
considering trying to dismantle longstanding legal barriers
to direct U.S. bank loans for the Soviet Union.
   But Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said on the
same television program, "We will provide credits . . . . We
want to send out a signal that this leadership in the Soviet
Union is valid and valuable."
   The remarks were later clarified by Derek Burney, who is
Canada's ambassador to the U.S. and Mr. Mulroney's special
assistant for the summit. He said the prime minister was
referring to two existing Canadian programs for the Soviet
Union -- one by the Canadian Wheat Board and the other by
Canada's Export-Import Bank. The Soviets aren't making full
use of either program, indicating that Canada could extend
credits to the Soviet Union without any new measures.
   The U.S. and its NATO allies did succeed in settling
disagreements over how to begin revamping the military
alliance. They agreed to thin out its forces on the
alliance's front line and begin putting them under new
multinational commands.
   In addition, the U.S. worked out an agreement declaring
that nuclear arms are weapons of "last resort" but endorsed
in the summit's final communique a statement that nuclear
arms will continue to "fulfill an essential role in the
overall strategy of the alliance." Britain and France wanted
such a statement to make clear that the alliance wasn't
suggesting that nuclear weapons could be discarded.
   The allies also agreed on pulling nuclear-tipped artillery
shells out of Europe. The U.S. originally had proposed taking
out the shells -- whose short range makes them nearly useless
as East European countries leave the Soviet military orbit --
only when the last Soviet soldier is withdrawn from Europe.
West Germany wanted to move more quickly.
   So NATO agreed that the weapons will be taken out as soon
as talks begin next year on a treaty cutting short-range
nuclear arms in Europe and the Soviets take the "reciprocal
action" of withdrawing their own nuclear artillery.
   The U.S. and West Germany agreed to make a general pledge
to shrink the army in the united Germany when a
conventional-arms agreement with the Soviets is signed late
this year, while putting off a formal agreement on the army's
size until a follow-on conventional-arms deal with the
Soviets.
   The allies, as expected, also agreed to invite Mr.
Gorbachev to address a future NATO meeting and to invite
countries of the Warsaw Pact to establish a "diplomatic
liaison" with NATO.
