   WASHINGTON -- The government revoked Discovery Airways'
operating authority, saying the airline failed to take steps
to ensure that it isn't owned or controlled by foreigners.
   The Transportation Department said Discovery failed to
meet several conditions it imposed when it granted the
airline provisional operating authority last spring. Under
U.S. law, foreigners can't control or own more than 25% of
the stock in American airlines.

   Hawaiian Airlines, a unit of HAL Inc., had filed suits
charging that Discovery was foreign owned.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said that even
after being given "numerous opportunities to satisfy our
concerns over its foreign control and compliance problems . .
. {Discovery} has failed to do so or even to show any
credible inclination to do so."
   The department had required that Philip Ho, owner of 75%
of Discovery's voting stock and president of Japanese-owned
Nansay Hawaii, place his Discovery shares in a voting trust
to prevent Nansay from "exercising control over Discovery
through Mr. Ho." It also ordered the carrier to appoint an
executive committee to direct corporate policy and to
prohibit one of the airline's founders, an Italian citizen,
from serving on it or performing any liaison functions.
   The Transportation Department said Discovery still can
seek a permanent license in a hearing before an
administrative law judge.
