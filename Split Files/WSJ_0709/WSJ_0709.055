N.V. Philips, the troubled Dutch electronics giant, wouldn't
pay a dividend for 1990.
   A spokesman for the Dutch electronics concern declined to

   Last week, Philips's new chairman, Jan Timmer, announced
plans to eliminate 10,000 jobs, or 3.5% of the company's work
force, and forecast a loss of about two billion guilders
($1.1 billion) this year, compared with net profit of 1.37
billion guilders in 1989. At that time, he refused to say
whether Philips would be able to afford a dividend.
   In 1989, the dividend was two guilders a share, the same
rate the company has paid since 1983.
   The Amro analyst, Peter Berg, urged investors to be
cautious in buying Philips shares because the company had
released only a rough outline of its strategy for stanching
huge losses in its computer and semiconductor divisions.
   On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Friday, Philips shares
slipped to 30.20 guilders from 30.50 guilders Thursday.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Timmer said in an interview with Philips's
in-house newsletter that the company needs a "change of
culture" and urged executives to shed their bureaucratic
habits, while advising employees to renounce "the mentality
of meekly accepting . . . things because you think you are
fighting a losing battle."
