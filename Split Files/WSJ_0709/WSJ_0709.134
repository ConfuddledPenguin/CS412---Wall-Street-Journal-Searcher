   WASHINGTON -- To the disappointment of many
environmentalists, Mother Earth is likely to take a back seat
to narcotics, terrorism and changes in Eastern Europe if the
U.S. has its way at this year's economic summit.
   The environment took center stage at last year's summit
meeting in Paris, which produced a communique calling for
"decisive action" to protect the Earth's environment. But
this year, the U.S. is pushing hard to de-emphasize
environmental issues.

   The environment "is a much tougher area" for the U.S. to
discuss at the summit this year, says a U.S. official
involved in planning the Houston meeting. "There's a distinct
difference in perspective in feelings of urgency between the
U.S. and some of the other summit nations," particularly on
the issue of global climate change.
   The European summit nations have been pushing hard to get
agreement on a schedule for reducing the level of "greenhouse
gases" in the atmosphere. These gases, such as carbon
dioxide, are blamed by many scientists and environmentalists
for a gradual increase in the Earth's temperature. But the
U.S. and, to some extent, the Japanese have steadfastly
refused to make such a commitment, arguing more scientific
study is needed.
   U.S. officials hope to shift the summit participants'
attention this week to issues like coordinating assistance to
the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and improving
international responses to fighting terrorism and illegal
drugs.
   Environmentalists are already condemning the expected
shift, saying whatever progress resulted from last year's
intense focus on environmental issues is in danger of being
lost. "Paris far and away broke new ground," says James T.B.
Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, a
lobbying group on environmental issues. "Statements about
population and tropical forests had been in previous
communiques, but in Paris more than a third of the final
communique was devoted to domestic and global environmental
issues."
   "It was an important and major breakthrough," he says. "It
showed that the leaders of the world recognized that the
environment, putting investment in energy efficiency,
conservation, forestry and pollution control were central to
the long-term economic benefit of not only the industrialized
world but the entire world."
   Still, Mr. Tripp believes that although "the communique
was very strong in terms of policy statements, it was weak in
terms of setting forth programs for action and schedules for
action." His group, in coalition with a number of other U.S.
and international environmental organizations, is developing
a "scorecard" of the seven summit nations. Issues on which
they are being rated include population control and ocean
dumping; preserving the global environment by reducing carbon
dioxide emissions and improving energy efficiency; protecting
diverse ecosystems such as reefs, wetlands and tropical
forests; and aiding Eastern Europe in correcting some of its
serious environmental problems.
   An early draft version of the environmental portion of the
summit communique drawn up by the U.S., and subject to
revision by the summit partners, demonstrates the cautious
approach favored by the Bush administration and stands in
sharp contrast to the sense of urgency the summit partners
projected in 1989.
   Last year's final communique said that the seven summit
nations "strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten
to induce climate change, endangering the environment and
ultimately the economy."
   U.S. summit writers this year propose saying they agree
that "increased greenhouse gas emissions are capable of
altering the global environment, albeit in a not yet
predictable manner." And while they urge steps to adjust to
global climate change, such steps, they say, must be
"justified on independent grounds" and not subject to
"scientific and economic uncertainties." They say, too, they
believe it is "premature to set specific targets or
timetables to stabilize or reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
   The draft communique also proposes additional steps to
support scientific research, to preserve wetlands and
tropical forests, to prevent ocean pollution, and to promote
environmental awareness in the developing world by supporting
environmentally sound development projects.
   Despite environmentalists' fears about a lack of progress
on their issues, other analysts say that such meetings are
worthwhile for their public-relations value, and that real
progress has to be made in other venues and through each
country's own domestic policies.
   "There aren't many substantive things that summits like
this can accomplish," says Daniel Mitchell, a fellow in
political economy at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, a
conservative think tank. In the end, he says, "domestic
political things drive these issues."
