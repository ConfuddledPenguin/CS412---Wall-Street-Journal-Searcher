   AKUREYRI, Iceland -- It is just after midnight when Hugh
Harvie finds his golf ball on the tundra of the 12th fairway.
Positioning his nine-iron for the approach shot, the Scotsman
turns to his caddie and says, "Laddie, I canna see the
green."
   The caddie points through the fog at a pennant flapping in
the distance. Mr. Harvie chips, looks, listens. Way off,
there is the conk of ball hitting boulder and richocheting
into the rough.

   "Wee bit of a slice on that one," Mr Harvie says, his
breath clouding in the frigid air. Reaching for the flask in
his golf bag, he adds, "If I don't find the ball, I may just
lie down and hibernate until dawn."
   He could be a long time sleeping. There are no dawns here
in midsummer, and no sunsets, either; at this latitude, the
sun shines all night. This allows Mr. Harvie and 100 other
golfers to knock-around-the-clock at the Arctic Open. The
tournament is held at the world's most northerly 18-hole golf
course, just 50 miles from the Arctic Circle.
   This polar stage attracts odd players, mostly here for the
novelty of the event. The 1990 field includes a Mormon
missionary from Utah who proselytizes in sand traps, and an
English golf writer who plans to marry his caddie between
rounds. "The bride wears thermals," declares Lisa Bateman,
shivering as her fiance, Neil Elsey, shanks a ball toward a
ditch filled with murky water. The ditch, used to channel
run-off from melting snow, is one of many at Akureyri. Mr.
Elsey puts his head down and hikes into the howling wind.
"You're looking at the extremists here," he says. "The real
golf fundamentalists."
   They have found a fitting shrine in Akureyri. The golf
course is perched amid snow-capped peaks, beside a
cobalt-blue finger of sea. Spread out below is a fishing
township founded by a 10th century Viking named Helgi the
Lean. In winter, temperatures can skid to minus-85 degrees
Fahrenheit, leaving fairways lumpy when the ground finally
thaws. Polar bears sometimes visit these parts, hitching a
ride aboard icebergs from nearby Greenland.
   Still, by Icelandic standards, golfing in Akureyri is
luxurious. One course lies on an extinct volcano and several
others are bordered by old lava fields. "We also have trees,"
says Akureyri's pro, David Barnwell, pointing at a few
stunted, wind-bent birches huddled near the 18th hole. In a
harsh land where glaciers cover more ground than forests,
most golf courses are lucky to sprout a few shrubs.
   In midsummer, Akureyri's latitude (just north of Nome,
Alaska) also affords 24-hour sun -- at least in theory. A
brochure advertising the Arctic Open tells of shorts-clad
golfers sending putts and shadows across the green at 2 a.m.
The club's pro shop even sells black golf balls, which are
easier to pick out when driving into the low-lying midnight
sun.
   That was last year. This year, the pro shop's best-selling
item is mittens. At tee off the mercury reads 34 degrees,
with pelting rain and 25-mile-per-hour winds making
conditions, well, arctic. "I wouldn't put my dog out in this
slop," says the Scotsman, Mr. Harvie. The tall, ruddy
hotelkeeper is wrapped in long johns, two pairs of pants, two
shirts, two sweaters, mittens and tartan cap. "I feel like a
great hairy ball," he says.
   John Rives, a U.S. Navy supply officer from North
Carolina, arrives in a Pebble Beach golf cap -- then quickly
adds a Navy-issue wool cap underneath. "I haven't had this
much fun since boot camp," he grumbles, searching for his
ball in the boggy, boulder-strewn rough. His playing partner,
Jeff Marks, is more philosophical. "God called me to Iceland
so I really can't complain," says the Mormon, who is based in
Akureyri. Mr. Marks is playing well, despite the conditions.
"We're the only sober ones out here," explains his caddie, a
fellow missionary.
   Tippling between shots isn't the only hazard of the
36-hole Open. Greens are small and covered in coarse grass
that hinders putting. Bunkers are better now that
groundskeepers have filled the traps with fine white sand,
replacing the black, sticky crushed lava that was there until
a year ago. The fairways, obscured by snow until mid-May, can
be patchy, but it is the swampy rough that inspires loathing
and fear.
   "I left my driver at the hotel because my whole mission is
just to stay on the fairway," says Jack Cristwell, an
Alabaman posted to a U.S. Navy station near Reykjavik. "Get
off the fairway," he adds, "and you're in deep `kimchi.'" Or,
to be more precise, you're in a glacial rubble of rocky
outcrops and spongy hillocks, which is exactly where Mr.
Cristwell spends much of the night. Finishing with a
first-round score of 102, double his handicap, he complains,
"The only thing driving straight is the rain."
   The play of the 100 other competitors, three of them pros,
is equally wretched. Englishman John Rooks opens the
tournament by dribbling a tee-shot six inches, on his way to
a 71-over-par score of 142. West German Manfred Kleindienst
ends the midsummer's nightmare with a 3:30 a.m. bunker shot
for his lousiest score in five years. "It could have been
worse," he says, lips numb and eyes filled with tears from
the wind. "I could have died of exposure."
   In the clubhouse, officials tally soaked scorecards and
chalk up triple-digit scores in disbelief while players seek
solace at the bar. The well-stocked lounge includes a potent
Icelandic schnapps known as "Black Death." But having fired a
102, Mr. Harvie thinks an even stronger draught is required.
"A half pint of arsenic," he says.
   Several hours later, Mr. Harvie and another Scotsman don
kilts for the wedding of Ms. Bateman and Mr. Elsey at a local
church. The reception is abbreviated. After a few glasses of
a French wine labeled "Le Bogey," golfers (including the
newlyweds and chaplain) return to the course to do just that.
   Though the weather is slightly better than the night
before, the golfing isn't. London lawyer Martin Kagan, who
had golfed throughout most of Europe and decided to try
something new, follows his first-night 125 with a
second-round 123. "At least I golfed consistently," he says.
"Consistently bad." Blowing his nose, he adds, "Next year,
I'll be playing in Portugal."
   Not surprisingly, Icelanders fare better. The chaplain who
performed the Elseys' wedding fires a hole-in-one, his first
ever and the only one of the Open. And the winner of the
trophy for amateurs is Akureyri headmaster, Jon Hannesson.
Asked for the key to victory, he replies: "Wearing the right
clothes." In his case, light-weight Gore-Tex and ear muffs.
"Most players had on so many layers, they could barely swing
a club," he says.
   Some day, Mr. Hannesson may have to add a dog sled to his
golfing gear. Twenty miles north of Akureyri, on a blustery
ridge above the town of Husavik, lies a nine-hole course that
the tourist literature describes as "tricky." So tricky, in
fact, that the fairway of the fourth hole winds through a
narrow gully and dead-ends in a snowfield, with the green
lying on a small ledge just above.
   "It would be amusing to have an Arctic Open here," says
the course chairman, Ausmunder Bjarnason. He is parked by the
first tee, watching sleet turn to snow flurries, and
pondering whether to cancel a scheduled tournament. Mr.
Bjarnason recognizes that Husavik's course is far from
meeting tournament standards. But he harbors some hope,
nonetheless. "We're waiting for the greenhouse effect," he
says.
