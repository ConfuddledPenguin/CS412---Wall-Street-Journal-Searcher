   Over the past year, the best soap opera at NBC has been in
Studio 3B. They call it the "Today" show. I call it "Blood on
the Sofa." First came the Bryant Gumbel memo, then the Jane
Pauley/Deborah Norville imbroglio. All along, the ratings of
"Today" plummeted.
   As viewers fled to "Good Morning America," NBC management
and executive producer Tom Capra (director Frank Capra's son)
designed a series of quick-fix solutions, which have been put
in place over the past few weeks. So now the question is, how
is "Today" (weekdays, 7-9 a.m.) today?

   The answer: Not so good. Trying to revive the family
feeling that early-morning programs strive for, NBC brought
back baseballer Joe Garagiola (last seen on "Today" in the
early 1970s) as everyone's favorite Uncle Joe. He looks a
little old these days -- glasses, wrinkles, a balder head --
but there's no denying his joviality. "I tell ya]" he'll
enthuse. "That's really special]"
   It seems that "Today" is casting Mr. Garagiola as the poor
man's Charles Kuralt. He does stories on whimsical happenings
in Wheezer, Idaho, like the oldtime fiddlers' contest.
"There's no better day on which to honor American tradition
than the Fourth of July," Joe will say, "and few things evoke
the sense of who we are and where we came from more than the
sound of a fiddle. . . ."
   Mr. Garagiola does best with subjects he can relate to --
like baseball, baseball and baseball. As a collector of
diamond memorabilia, he got pretty riled up about the new
business of players charging kids for autographs, and frankly
it was good to see him get a little steamed. But there are
whole vast realms of stories that he just can't handle. One
anecdote circulating around NBC describes Mr. Garagiola's
first assignment -- to cover the Holocaust Memorial in
Washington. Just imagine.
   Joe has another problem: He has to concentrate real hard
when he reads the teleprompter. His delivery is often stilted
at best. It's clear why folks at NBC are referring to Mr.
Garagiola as a "Band-Aid for their problems, not a long-term
solution."
   But whatever pokes you can take at Mr. Garagiola --
especially at his habit of saying things like "that really
makes you feel good, doesn't it?]" -- there's no denying that
he comes across as a warm, genuine human being, not plastic
at all.
   That's more than you can say for Ms. Norville. From 7 a.m.
to 9 a.m., she's got this huge fake smile plastered all over
her face. And she comes out with sentiments like, "I get so
angry at the ballparks when people aren't paying attention
{to the national anthem}."
   Now admittedly, Ms. Norville never got a break during the
"Jane vs. Deborah" controversy, but the real problem lies
much deeper: She is fundamentally miscast as a "Today" host,
which even NBC executives will admit privately. Ms. Norville
is talented and overwhelmingly pretty and would be fine as a
reporter or a newsmagazine anchor. But it's hard to take that
plastic grin in the morning.
   A show like "Today" is a strange blend of news and
entertainment, of facts and features and ads for "2,000
Flushes." All of the morning programs on all three major
networks have come a long way in the past few decades;
they've evolved way beyond trained monkeys like J. Fred
Muggs. But now these shows are held to a higher standard.
They require a delicate balance of charm and intelligence
from their hosts, an ability to chat with George Hamilton and
interview George Bush. Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley can
deftly handle both ends of the equation, the easygoing
livingroom banter and the hard-edged news coverage. But Ms.
Norville falls short on the first front, Mr. Garagiola on the
second.
   "Today" has also added former CBS newsreader Faith Daniels
to its mix, and she's not terrible, even if her eyebrows do
tend to fly out of control. But "Today" is holding a real
trump card it ought to try playing soon -- national
correspondent Katie Couric. While lacking the Miss Peach
Blossom looks of Ms. Norville, Ms. Couric is a solid reporter
with charm, intelligence and the good sense to be embarrassed
by the silly "throw lines," the awkward transitions from news
to entertainment that are plaguing this version of "Today" in
its quest for happy talk. (One especially stupid item went on
at length about how 30 of 700 officers on the Sydney,
Australia, police force flunked their shooting test.)
   Last Monday, when Ms. Couric and Ms. Norville were
interviewing the chef of the 21 Club, it was revealing to see
Ms. Norville uneasily making conversation, while Ms. Couric
just poked curiously at the corn chowder. As the chef rambled
on about a new health cheese called Alpine Lace, Ms. Couric
looked up quizzically and asked, "Is that stuff any better
than Velveeta?" She's a real person, just what the "Today"
show needs.
   Right now, NBC has thrown every stopgap solution it can
think of to plug the leak at "Today." It's got a large and
unwieldy cast, with a confusing setup of part-time hosts (Mr.
Garagiola, for example, is just on Tuesdays to Thursdays) and
none of them are what the show really needs. There's Deborah
Norville, with Bryant Gumbel, Willard Scott, Joe Garagiola
and medical man Art Ulene. I think of them as Snow White and
her dwarfs: Grumpy, Happy, Dopey and Doc. (Of course, no one
is Bashful.)
   In the meantime, the question remains: With the three
major networks all putting on the same format show during the
same a.m. hours, isn't it time to rethink the whole notion of
the morning program?

   A brief, unhappy note: Paul Wynne, the San Francisco
television reporter who chronicled his life with AIDS in the
weekly installments of KGO-TV's landmark "Paul Wynne's
Journal," died late last week. His courageous program made
many important human points, the most poignant of which was
its end.
