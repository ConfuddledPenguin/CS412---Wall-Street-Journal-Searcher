   In her haste to bash the Japan-bashers, Susan W. Liebeler
ignores some of the disquieting implications of the Graham
and Krugman study (review of "Foreign Direct Investment in
the United States" by Edward M. Graham and Paul R. Krugman,
Leisure &amp; Arts, June 11). They argue that the competitive
strengths of American firms have declined relative to those
of foreign firms; thus the growth of foreign direct
investment (FDI) is "a part of the general decline of U.S.
economic pre-eminence." While Ms. Liebeler and Messrs. Graham
and Krugman want to draw a sharp line between FDI and the
trade deficits the truth is that a troubling connection does
exist. Both FDI and the trade deficits reflect a declining
ability of American firms to compete with their Japanese and
European rivals.
   If there were no costs to this decline, it would perhaps
be easier to accept the do-nothing policy prescription of
Messrs. Graham and Krugman. But there are real costs. Family
incomes in the U.S. have stagnated since 1973. The wages of
production workers continue to fall by roughly 1% a year. Our
growing international debts have limited American influence
in international affairs.

   My question for Messrs. Graham and Krugman and Ms.
Liebeler is: Why shouldn't we be alarmed at the prospect of
reduced economic and political opportunities?
