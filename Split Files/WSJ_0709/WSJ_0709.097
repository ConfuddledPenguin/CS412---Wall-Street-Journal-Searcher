   WHO HAS HEARD ABOUT THE EC?

   Seven out of 10 Washingtonians are unaware of plans to
turn the European Community into the world's largest single
market by late 1992, according to an EC survey.
   But 73% who know of the plan think it's a good idea that
the 12 EC nations will remove their internal borders by late
1992, the survey found. The EC's Eurobarometer poll
questioned 1,001 Washingtonians about the EC early this year.
   The survey showed that 47% of Washington, D.C., residents
were aware that the EC existed. That compared with 61% of
Moscow residents. Within the EC, awareness of the community
rated 66% on average, with Danes being most aware (88%) of
the EC but least enthusiastic about it; only 31% of Danes
called the community a "good thing."
   The poll found the lowest awareness of the EC in Spain
(51%). Italians were most enthusiastic about the community,
with 66% giving it their full endorsement.
                                                                                                       

   WHALING BAN CONTINUES
                                                                                                       

   The International Whaling Commission ended a conference in
the Netherlands with an agreement to continue a global ban on
commercial whaling. The agreement prompted Japan to blast the
regulatory body for succumbing to environmentalist pressure
and to threaten withdrawal from the commission. Japan, along
with Norway and Iceland, had wanted the minke whale excluded
from the ban, claiming the minke, smallest of the
commercially valuable whales, was no longer in danger of
extinction.
                                                                                                       

   A NEW ITALIAN PLASTIC
                                                                                                       

   Montedison S.p.A., an arm of Italy's Ferruzzi Group,
announced the market launch of cornstarch-based biodegradable
thermoplastic materials. The first production line for
Mater-Bi -- the trade name under which the materials will be
sold -- recently went into regular operation at a plant in
central Italy. Mater-Bi will be sold in market segments where
biodegradability of plastic materials is valued, such as
human hygiene and personal-health care, medical-surgical aids
and certain packaging applications.
                                                                                                       

   HEALTH CARE IN RURAL CHINA
                                                                                                       

   Medical care in rural China is in such short supply that
500 people share a single health worker who probably has
never had professional training, the China Daily reported. By
contrast, six health workers serve every 1,000 urban
residents, the newspaper said. Furthermore, 63% of the
medical staff in hospitals at the township level "have never
received regular professional education," the paper quoted an
official of the Ministry of Public Health as saying. In an
attempt to narrow the gap between urban and rural health
care, the ministry has launched a program to emphasize the
training of medical personnel in the countryside, the
official said.
                                                                                                       

   ISRAELI POLL ON GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   Most Israeli Jews don't object to German unification,
according to a poll published in the Jerusalem daily Yedioth
Ahronoth. The poll showed 36% of those asked approved of a
united Germany despite memories of Nazi Germany's murder of
six million Jews in World War II. Thirty-five percent of the
602 people questioned were indifferent about German
unification. About 28% of those polled were unhappy about
unification, with most saying they feared the consequences of
another greater Germany.
                                                                                                       

   HITACHI AGREEMENT
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Hitachi Ltd. has reached an agreement with China
Greatwall Computer Group Corp. to develop software that would
allow Chinese-made terminals to be attached to Hitachi's
general-purpose computers, Hitachi officials said. A Japanese
software maker, Intercom Inc., is also a party to the
agreement. Currently, local customers must buy Hitachi
terminals to work on Hitachi's computer systems, which is a
drag on sales of Hitachi general-purpose computers.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN TRIMS RICE SUBSIDY
                                                                                                       

   Japan cut by 1.5% the price it will pay to rice farmers
this year.
   The cut is the first in two years, but it is much less
than some government officials were hoping for to stem U.S.
criticism of Japan's rice market, which is virtually closed
to imports. An earlier Ministry of Agriculture plan to cut
the price paid to farmers for their rice crops by about 5%
was killed when it was opposed by members of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, who depend heavily on farmer
support. The party had requested a freeze on the price.
   Japan's government regulates and subsidizes the domestic
rice market, buying much of the rice crop and reselling it to
consumers at lower prices. The subsidy cost the government
311.7 billion yen (about $2 billion) in fiscal 1989.
   The 1.5% reduction is expected to help cut the budget by
about nine billion yen.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's daughter Galina won
a court action for the return of a country house, a
Mercedes-Benz car and other valuables, a Moscow newspaper
reported. The items -- including cash valued at more than
$100,000 -- were confiscated when her husband, Yuri
Churbanov, was convicted of corruption in 1988. . . . The Sea
of Galilee, which provides a third of Israel's fresh water,
has dipped to the lowest level ever recorded, an Israeli
water official said. After two dry winters, Israel is facing
its worst water crisis in modern times.
