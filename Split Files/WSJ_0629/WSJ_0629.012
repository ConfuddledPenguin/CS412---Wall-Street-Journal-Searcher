   Temple-Inland, a Diboll, Texas, forest products and
financial services concern, said the sale allows it to
concentrate its financial services business on mortgage-loan
servicing operations and Texas thrifts. Temple-Inland said it
won't record a significant gain on the sale, contrary to
earlier expectations.
