   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NCNB Corp. said it created a new layer
of management to oversee its commercial and consumer banking
operations. The company named Kenneth Lewis, president of
NCNB Texas, as president of the new group, called NCNB's
General Bank.
   Mr. Lewis, 43 years old, thus becomes NCNB's top executive
in charge of consumer and commercial banking, and a possible
successor to the bank-holding company's 54-year-old chairman
and chief executive officer, Hugh McColl.

   "This certainly puts him in a leading spot -- if not the
leading spot -- provided he doesn't commit hari-kari," said
John Mason, a banking analyst with Interstate/Johnson Lane in
Atlanta. "But that's well down the road -- at least several
years."
   Mr. Lewis, who will remain president of NCNB Texas until a
successor is named, will move from Dallas to Charlotte, and
will report directly to Mr. McColl.
   In a statement, Mr. McColl said, "Ken Lewis's broad
background, especially his consumer and commercial banking
experience in Texas and Florida, prepares him well to head
NCNB's General Bank."
   NCNB has branch-banking operations in Texas, Florida,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland and
Virginia. Before becoming president of NCNB Texas in August
1988, Mr. Lewis served as president of NCNB National Bank of
Florida. He joined the company in 1969.
