   LONDON -- The Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development predicted that the U.S. will trail Europe and
Japan in investment growth and overall economic expansion
this year and next.
   The forecast was part of a larger economic appraisal that
saw a continuation of the industrial world's seven-year
expansion, but at a slower rate, with inflation poised to
subside after several years of creeping upward.

   The Paris-based organization, made up of the world's 24
leading industrial countries, predicted that U.S. gross fixed
investment would grow at 3.2% this year and 3.4% in 1991,
compared with Japanese investment growth of 9.6% and 4.9% for
the two years. German investment was predicted to expand by
6.6% this year and 5% in 1991. European members of the OECD
were expected to show an investment growth of 4.4% this year
and 4.7% in 1991.
   U.S. economic growth was forecast to be 2.3% this year and
2.5% next year. That compares with Japanese growth of 4.7%
and 4% and German growth of 3.9% and 3.4% for the two years.
As a group, European members of the OECD were predicted to
expand by 2.9% this year and 2.8% next year.
   The projections suggest that industrialized economies have
settled into a pattern of longer, less inflationary growth
periods ending in slowdowns but not necessarily deep
recessions. The prediction of more robust investment in
Europe and Japan than in the U.S. points to another generally
hopeful trend: The major economic blocs aren't moving in
lockstep, so that a sluggish economy in one part of the world
can be offset by exports to economies growing at a more
robust rate.
   In its analysis of the U.S., the OECD said that financial
conditions remain "rather unsettled," with huge insolvencies
in the thrift industry, defaults on junk bonds and problem
real estate loans. Meanwhile, consumer spending is slowing
due to sluggish growth in real disposable income. The
organization noted that the Federal Reserve Board's monetary
stance hasn't changed substantially since an easing in 1989,
creating relatively high borrowing costs.
   The report estimated the U.S. current-account imbalance to
be about $100 billion this year and $97 billion in 1991. But
the OECD, like other organizations, seemed confident that the
deficits can be financed. The risk, it said, is that big
deficits stir up political pressure for protectionist trade
laws and curbs on foreign investment. These steps, the OECD
warned, do have "destabilizing consequences."
   The OECD predicted that Japan's strong world-trade
position will persist, with the Asian economic giant's
current-account surplus rising to $59 billion in 1991 from an
estimated $49 billion this year. Japanese inflation,
minuscule by Western standards, was predicted to inch up to
2.7% this year and to drop to 2.6% in 1991.
   German reunification will unleash considerable investment
and consumer activity, creating export opportunities for West
Germany's trading partners. But the OECD noted that "hard
facts about the state of the East German economy are still
sparse," so that the outlook is full of uncertainties.
   The OECD said other Central and Eastern European countries
represent a potentially large demand for goods and services
from the major industrial countries. But the organization
added that "the speed with which foreign resources can be
productively absorbed will depend crucially on the pace of
structural and institutional transformation."
   Outside East Germany, investment flows to reform-minded
East Bloc states initially will be relatively modest, the
OECD said. The organization even raised the sobering prospect
that such flows from the industrial countries won't be enough
to offset losses stemming from higher energy bills from the
Soviet Union. Eastern European countries are expected to pay
considerably more for Soviet oil and gas once Comecon, the
Communist bloc's trade arrangement, is dismantled next year.
   The OECD predicted a modest increase in jobs in the 24
industrial countries. It noted that 85% of the civilian jobs
created in the seven major industrial countries were in the
service sector. Meanwhile, migration has become "an
increasingly important phenomenon for many OECD economies,"
the report stated. For European countries with aging
populations, immigrants have had the positive effect of
enlarging the working-age segment of the population.
