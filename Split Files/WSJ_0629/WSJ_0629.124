   INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BRANDS Inc. (Trumbull, Conn.) --
Robert P. Freeman, who held the posts of president and chief
operating officer for seven months, has left the company.
Bruce A. Hahn, chairman and chief executive officer, who was
succeeded as president by Mr. Freeman, said Mr. Freeman's
departure "results from a combination of streamlining and
cost-cutting modes the company has adopted along with Mr.
Freeman's desire to pursue other interests." The company said
Mr. Freeman's duties will be assumed by Mr. Hahn and by the
chief financial officer. Mr. Freeman was unavailable for
comment.
