   WASHINGTON -- President Bush and other Western leaders
will discuss at their economic summit in Houston July 9-11
whether to provide aid and loans to the Soviet Union,
according to the Treasury's undersecretary for international
affairs, David Mulford.
   U.S. policy on the issue is still "under review," Mr.
Mulford said. France and West Germany recently have pushed
for more aid for the Soviet Union, but it's widely expected
that discussions at Houston merely will lead to an agreement
to study the issue further.

   The U.S., Britain, Canada and Japan want to see more
market-oriented reform in the Soviet Union before committing
large sums of money.
   Mr. Mulford said the leaders of the seven summit countries
-- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada -- also will review the state of the international
economy. The Treasury expects the economies of the seven
countries to grow 3% a year in 1990 and 1991.
   The current Uruguay round of trade negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade also will be a major
topic at Houston, said Mr. Mulford, who added that he expects
there will be discussion of an impasse over how to address
agricultural subsidies. International debt strategy and
initiatives on the environment, drug trafficking and money
laundering also will be summit items, Mr. Mulford said. He
added that relations with China will be discussed as well.
