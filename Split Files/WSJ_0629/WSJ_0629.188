   NEW YORK -- Argentina accepted a proposal under which
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., a Bell Atlantic Corp. subsidiary
and a group of Argentine companies would take a total 60%
stake in half of the state telephone company, Empresa
Nacional de Telecomunicaciones.
   The companies will invest $100 million in the state phone
company, known as Entel. And Manufacturers, the big
bank-holding company here, is arranging a syndicate of
financial institutions that want to swap a total of $2.3
billion of their Argentine debt for equity in Entel. Bell
Atlantic is the Philadelphia-based regional Bell phone
company.

   The bid for part of Entel is part of the Argentine
government's drive to privatize a number of businesses. Under
the government's plan, Entel is to be broken into two
companies, one covering the northern half of Argentina and
one the southern half. Each of the two new phone entities
also will be assigned half of the capital, Buenos Aires,
where almost two-thirds of the country's 3.2 million phone
lines are installed.
   The Manufacturers/Bell Atlantic group bid against two
other companies, Telefonica S.A. of Spain and STET of Italy,
for the northern zone. The group didn't bid for the southern
zone; the government stipulated that no one bidder could win
both zones.
   The other 40% of the northern zone will be sold 25% to the
public in stock offerings, 10% to Entel employees, and 5% to
local telephone cooperatives.
   A spokesman for Manufacturers said the bank expected to
end up with a total stake of about 16% in the company
covering the northern zone. In the transaction, the bank
expects to swap a "material portion" of its Argentine debt,
which totaled $700 million at year end 1989, he said.
