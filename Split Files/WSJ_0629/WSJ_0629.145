   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a partner
in a New York law firm with trading on inside information
obtained from a client.
   In a civil complaint in federal court in Manhattan, the
SEC charged Henry A. Singer with buying 6,600 shares of
WearEver-Proctor-Silex Inc. stock at a time when the company
was discussing a management leveraged buy-out. Mr. Singer, 52
years old, is a partner in Morrison Cohen Singer &amp; Weinstein.

   Mr. Singer, through his attorney, Robert G. Morvillo,
called the SEC charges "factually inaccurate and legally
deficient" and said he intends to fight them. Mr. Morvillo
said that there is "substantial documentary evidence and
corroborative testimony of several other witnesses which
confirm that Mr. Singer did not purchase WearEver stock based
on inside information."
   According to the SEC complaint, Mr. Singer bought 5,000
shares of WearEver's stock Aug. 19, 1987, at $13.25 a share,
based on information he allegedly obtained from Lawrence A.
McLernon, a member of the company's board, concerning the
proposed leveraged buy-out. The SEC said that Mr. Singer, a
corporate lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions,
represented Mr. McLernon and that the two were friends.
   The SEC alleged that Mr. Singer bought another 1,600
shares Nov. 2, 1987 at $9.50 each, two months after he was
retained by a special committee of WearEver's board that
included Mr. McLernon. The complaint alleges that at the time
of Mr. Singer's second purchase, he possessed nonpublic
information that indicated that there were potential
third-party bidders for WearEver that were likely to bid more
than the $18 a share that WearEver's management had offered.
   Nacco Industries Inc. acquired WearEver for $17.50 a share
in April 1988. The SEC said that after learning of the
purchase, Mr. Singer sold his stock, earning $34,050 on the
sale.
   In his statement, Mr. Singer said that he had cooperated
with the SEC's inquiry and that the SEC had chosen "either to
ignore or misconstrue all of the evidence presented to it."
Mr. Singer's law firm issued a statement saying it "stands
behind Mr. Singer."

   AN ILLINOIS CONTRACTOR is indicted on unusual charges.
   A federal grand jury in Milwaukee indicted contractor S.A.
Healy Co. for allegedly violating federal workplace-safety
laws in connection with a 1988 explosion that killed three
Healy workers at an underground work-site.
   It is unusual for federal prosecutors to bring criminal
charges for breach of the occupational safety and health
statutes, although the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration often imposes civil penalties.
   The 12-count indictment alleges that Healy willfully
failed to properly vent a tunnel or properly instruct workers
in underground safety precautions, and failed to cut the
electricity in the tunnel after dangerous levels of methane
gas had been detected. All the counts are misdemeanors
because federal law doesn't permit prosecution of OSHA law
violations as felonies.
   "The feds are bringing the biggest guns they have against
Healy, and we appreciate and applaud" the move, says Joseph
Kinney, executive director of the Chicago-based National Safe
Workplace Institute. But, he adds, "it's ridiculous {they}
can't do more."
   Each of the 12 misdemeanor counts in the indictment
brought against Healy, based in McCook, Ill., carries a
maximum fine of $500,000.
   An attorney for Healy said the company "regrets the tragic
accident, but doesn't believe that any of its management
employees committed reckless acts." The company believes
management "will be vindicated," he says.
   Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann,
using state law, also this week filed two charges of reckless
homicide against Healy. But he says the state's
$10,000-a-count maximum fine on such charges "is not enough."

   MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE upheld for New York Supreme Court
justices.
   A federal appeals court in New York reversed a lower-court
decision that had prohibited the state of New York from
forcing a state judge to retire at age 76. The federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission had filed the suit on
behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin, who is 77.
   The appeals court ruled that the federal age
discrimination law, under which the suit was brought, does
not apply to New York Supreme Court justices because they are
elected. The law states that it does not apply to "any person
elected to public office."
   Justice Rubin and the attorneys for the state of New York
and the EEOC declined to comment.

   THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S criminal division may get a new
chief.
   President Bush nominated Robert Mueller, a personal aide
to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, assistant attorney
general in charge of criminal matters.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Mueller would succeed
Edward Dennis, who said he will resign Aug. 31. The change
comes shortly after a shake-up of the department's senior
staff. But Justice Department officials, including Mr.
Dennis, stressed that his departure is voluntary and
amicable.
   Mr. Mueller, a special assistant to Mr. Thornburgh on
criminal issues, previously served as a federal prosecutor in
Massachusetts and California.
   A career prosecutor, Mr. Dennis said he would return to
his hometown of Philadelphia to join the law firm of Morgan,
Lewis &amp; Bockius as a partner.
