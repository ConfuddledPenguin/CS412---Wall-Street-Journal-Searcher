   OAKLAND, Calif. -- They met on a beach in the Hamptons in
1960. He tried to impress her with his business acumen,
talking at length about securities documents known as "red
herrings." She was coy, not letting on that she certainly
knew a lot more about such matters than he did. Only later
would the talk turn to the topic that would soon become their
shared secret passion: Savings and loans.
   No kidding. Herb Sandler was a gangly New York lawyer, and
Marion Osher was a sharp-minded Wall Street financial analyst
from Maine, and from that chance encounter would spring a
partnership that has become one of the more intriguing -- and
successful -- in American business.

   The Sandlers, who married in 1961, run Golden West
Financial Corp. here, an S&amp;L that is truly a mom-and-pop
operation, albeit one with $20 billion in assets.
   While the air is full of doomsday talk about the thrift
industry these days, by many measures Golden West, whose main
operating unit is World Savings &amp; Loan Association, is among
the nation's strongest financial institutions. Annual growth
in earnings from its traditional lending operations has
averaged 19% over the past 20 years. Analysts expect Golden
West's 1990 net income to surge about 27% to some $200.3
million, or $3.19 a share.
   Its stock price has risen from a split-adjusted $3.75 in
the spring of 1984 to a closing price of $29.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange yesterday. Starting with a $4 million
investment in 1962, the Sandlers now own about 7% of a
company with a current market capitalization of nearly $2
billion. They have achieved this through a remarkable
combination of savvy marketing and relentlessly stodgy --
some say boring -- business principles. First among them is a
ferocious devotion to penny-pinching that has kept their
costs lower than any other large depository institution's,
bringing new meaning to the term "thrift."
   The Sandlers rarely stray beyond making adjustable-rate
loans in the snooze-inducing home mortgage market, declining
to offer even automated teller machines. They do without
corporate jets and corporate dining rooms and even corporate
receptionists: Visitors to the company's 17-story
headquarters are instructed by a placard to announce their
own arrival on an old black telephone. Marion says she does
allow herself the extravagance of a chauffeur: It is her
husband, who handles that extra chore for free.
   Two other principles have been to hoard capital and
concentrate only on conservatively priced home loans. The
Sandlers, for example, basically refused to compete with S&amp;Ls
that in the '80s were routinely making below-market loans or
venturing into commercial real estate.
   "It's the quintessential application of common sense to
the thrift industry," says Alex Sheshunoff, a banking
consultant based in Austin, Texas. "If Benjamin Franklin were
alive today he'd be comfortable sitting on Golden West's
board."
   Along the way, mom and pop Sandler have openly and often
gratuitously insulted some of their competitors, riled
government regulators, influenced federal thrift policy with
high-profile political lobbying and generally earned a
reputation as the shrewdest thrift operators in the country.
   Golden West's story illustrates an oft-overlooked truth
about the battered and much-maligned thrift industry, which
collectively lost $19 billion last year. About half of the
nation's S&amp;Ls -- some 1,250 or so of the nation's remaining
2,500 thrifts not in government conservatorship -- actually
are relatively healthy. Many, like Los Angeles-based H.F.
Ahmanson Corp.'s Home Savings of America unit and Washington
Federal Savings in Seattle, are even thriving, by sticking
close to thrifts' traditional business of making home
mortgages and by squeezing costs.
   It remains to be seen how many of these healthy thrifts
will survive the wrenching changes in the industry augured by
the thrift bailout bill and fierce competition from
commercial banks and government-sponsored mortgage agencies.
Moreover, they still depend on healthy mortgage markets,
which may turn sickly this year if the sharp downturn in home
construction continues. Golden West in particular has to
prove that it, unlike most of other big thrifts, can manage
its recent rapid growth.
   But Golden West's success is all the more striking because
the Sandlers have achieved something far more rare than rich
profits in the thrift industry: jointly running a
multibillion-dollar business and avoiding divorce. Many
couples who've tried, like Susie and Doug Tompkins of
apparel-maker Esprit de Corp., have seen their marriages
dissolve amid feuding over the direction or control of the
company. "A lot of couples would wind up strangling each
other in {the Sandlers} situation," says Herbert Gold, a San
Francisco writer and a friend of the Sandlers. "Most people
vow to stay together for better or worse but not for lunch.
It's a real testament to the uniqueness of Herb and Marion's
relationship."
   That uniqueness shows up in the Sandlers' management
style, a bizarre, two-headed thing that can be disconcerting
to watch. Consider this recent exchange, over a lunch of
decidedly inexpensive cold-cut sandwiches:
   Marion: The secret to our success is that we stay close to
the fundamentals --
   Herb: May I say something, dear? What she means is --
   Marion: I'm not finished, dear. We do a basic business --
   Herb: That's right, dear. Let me explain a little bit . .
. Is that right, dear?
   Marion: Well, no, dear . . .
   And so on. Herb, 58, is chairman of the board and co-chief
executive. Marion, 59, is president and co-chief executive.
They've split their duties as equally as their titles. Herb
tends to focus on big-picture issues, credit matters and
public speaking. Marion, an inveterate numbers cruncher,
handles financial analysis, marketing and deposit gathering;
she also personally writes the company's annual reports.
   Their strategy evolved largely from Marion's work as a
thrift analyst on Wall Street in the early 1960s. "Marion
concluded that the thrift business was almost a guaranteed
moneymaker," recalls Bernard Osher, her brother, who now runs
Butterfield &amp; Butterfield, a San Francisco auction house. "It
was a regulated industry, and she saw that if you kept right
on top of things, kept your costs down and stayed with the
basics, there were profits to be made." It was Marion's idea
to head west from New York -- partly to buy a thrift, and
partly to combat her lifelong asthma.
   In 1962, the Sandlers packed up their belongings, drove to
California and eventually bought Golden West, then a sleepy
institution with $34 million of assets and two offices.
   Golden West has grown steadily since, but the truly
explosive growth has come in the past two years. During the
mid-1980s, as many thrifts grew madly, the Sandlers
retrenched, thinking that home loans were being irrationally
priced too low to be profitable.
   As a result, World Savings, the main lending unit,
basically was shut down from 1985 to 1987, generating no
asset growth. The Sandlers buoyed profits by selling off huge
bundles of mortgage-backed securities; net income from such
sales and other non-lending activities totaled $90.9 million
in 1985 and 1986.
   Golden West at the time had lending operations in just two
states, California and Colorado. The Sandlers saw the need
for expansion, but decided they needed time to overhaul their
lending procedures and risk controls before barreling into
unfamiliar territories. They also dispatched teams to
scrutinize possible new markets.
   "People said we were through, they said we'd lost our
marketing touch," Herb recalls. "Wall Street crucified us.
Well, we knew what we were doing. One thing you don't do is
let Wall Street run your business."
   He adds, with great satisfaction: "Of the competitors that
laughed at us, not a single one is still in business today."
   In its quiet period the company built its capital ratios
far above government requirements, giving it the extra cash
to finance expansion -- through acquisitions and the opening
of new offices -- into 16 new states, and allowing it to pile
on billions of dollars of new mortgages. The company has also
been lucky; its return to a growth mode coincided with a
prolonged boom in the California housing market, still its
main turf. Assets jumped from $12.9 billion at the end of
1987 to more than $20 billion now.
   Such fevered growth usually is a precursor of disaster in
the thrift industry, but the Sandlers reduced that risk by
keeping things boring. During the growth spurt, and
throughout their history, they eschewed junk bonds,
condominium loans, commercial real estate and some of the
other hot new lending games opened up by deregulation in the
early 1980s. Their one foray outside of home mortgages, a
two-year flirtation with car loans, was a bust; they
abandoned that business in 1987.
   Their lending standards also are tougher than those of
most thrifts, in part because of a change the Sandlers made
during their lending lull: most loans must be approved by a
committee of top executives. "There is too much potential for
myopia when you have decision-makers at too low a level,"
Herb explains. "There is a tendency to push for volume
because it looks good."
   Furthermore, the Sandlers generally won't lend more than
80% of a home's purchase price; many lenders in California
will go to 90%. Primarily for these reasons, World Savings'
bad loans are phenomenally low: Its repossessed real estate
amounted to only 0.1% of its roughly $20 billion in assets at
year-end.
   Even more important to the Sandlers' success has been
their fanatical cost-cutting. Top executives -- even the
Sandlers -- never fly first class. James Judd, Golden West's
chief operating officer, stays in mid-priced hotels and rents
economy cars when he's on the road, and expects other
executives to do the same.
   Shortly after acquiring one new branch a few years back,
Mr. Judd noticed that "there were times when the lobby was so
barren of customers that you could fling a dead cat through
there and not hit anybody. Yet we still had the same number
of tellers as at the peak hours." Mr. Judd arranged for more
tellers during heavy hours and fewer during light ones.
   While the Sandlers pay their employees well -- and reward
them with stock options that the company's success has made
very valuable -- they stretch their manpower to save money.
Golden West has about 3,100 employees; by comparison, CalFed
Inc., which is slightly larger in asset base, has 5,620.
   Bonuses are awarded partly on the basis of a manager's
ability to meet or beat budget. That prompted one branch
manager to shut off half the lights in his branch during
working hours; even Marion says "that was going a little too
far."
   Some competitors say this simple, low-cost approach --
particularly the fact that Golden West offers no ATM machines
or credit cards -- could backfire some day. "They may one day
wake up to discover that they are behind the times," says
Patrick Price, retired chairman of San Francisco Federal
Savings &amp; Loan. One generally admiring rival chief executive
says he wonders whether the Sandlers are deferring
expenditures on such products as ATMs so the company's
profits would look better to a possible acquirer.
   "That is an incredibly naive and extraordinarily stupid
comment," Herb replies caustically. "Who said that? Is he in
the business? He ought to find out what his costs are on
ATMs. He obviously doesn't know how to analyze anything."
There are no plans to sell, either, he says.
   "We have analyzed this thoroughly, and we see no evidence
that our customers want ATMs," says Marion. Moreover, the
company has installed spaces for ATMs in all its branches.
"If the customers want ATMs, we can have them put in
virtually overnight," adds Herb.
   Though witty and personable, Herb can be vicious when on
the attack, and among his favorite targets are the fast-buck
thrift operators, regulators and members of Congress he and
Marion blame for a thrift crisis they've been predicting
since the early '80s.
   Herb was in full battle cry at congressional hearings in
August 1988. He figured that losses in the mounting thrift
crisis then were at least $100 billion, and in a
now-legendary performance, he denounced official estimates
that the problem was no more than $15 billion as "pure
unadulterated nonsense right out of Alice and Wonderland."
Arms flailing, voice roaring, he also liberally invoked such
words as "incompetent" and "insane."
   Marion is no slouch as a critic, either. "Every time I go
to Washington I am simply amazed at the the pathetic quality
of this country's leadership," she declares.
   Such tirades have earned the Sandlers as many enemies as
friends, but subsequent events have proved them largely
correct. The cost of paying and financing the thrift
industry's losses over the next decade will range from $400
billion to $500 billion, according to a recent study by Mr.
Sheshunoff, the banking consultant.
   So where do the Sandlers turn for an encore? They're
tight-lipped about their future course, but privately, Herb
has remarked on Golden West's growing capital cushion and
coyly noted that "you don't go hunting for elephant without
an elephant gun." Friends take that to mean that the couple
may be cooking up a big acquisition.
   That might change the look of the company, but as long as
the Sandlers are there, Golden West will continue to bear
their unique stamp. There is Marion's obsession with detail
and level-headedness: She never throws a party without first
sending each guest a full list of who is attending, and she
usually wears clothes she knits or sews herself.
   And there is Herb's quirkiness. In a meeting several years
ago at Golden West headquarters with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co. analyst Jonathan Gray, Herb is said to have refused to
answer a single question about his business and instead
discoursed for 45 minutes on the mating habits of the praying
mantis.
   Herb says he doesn't remember that. Mr. Gray won't
comment, except to say, "A lot of people like Herb and a lot
of people respect him, but I don't think anybody understands
him."
