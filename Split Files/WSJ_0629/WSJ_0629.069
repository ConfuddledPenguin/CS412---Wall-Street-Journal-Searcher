   NEW YORK -- Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said it will take
a substantial charge against second-quarter earnings as a
result of the bank holding company's cost-cutting
reorganization plan.
   The company also said that it will place more than $150
million in loans to developer Donald Trump on nonperforming
status. Other lenders are expected to take similar action in
reclassifying a portion of their loans to Mr. Trump as
nonperforming.

   Such status means that the loans aren't performing
according to the original terms of the borrowers' loan
agreement. It doesn't mean the bank won't eventually be
repaid the loans.
   Manufacturers Hanover said that the one-time charge will
reduce operating earnings for the second quarter below the
$96 million, or $1.21 a share, it earned in this year's first
quarter. Although the size of the charge hasn't been
determined, it isn't expected to exceed the bank's operating
earnings for the second quarter.
   The disclosures came in a prospectus for the proposed sale
of four million shares of Manufacturers Hanover preferred.
   Manufacturers stock closed at $34.50, off 25 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Like many other large banks, Manufacturers is struggling
to reduce expenses in the face of slack corporate finance
business. It earlier announced a reorganization aimed at
slashing costs to bring them more in line with expected
revenue.
   Chemical Banking Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and
Chase Manhattan Corp. all have taken or face the need to take
similar charges as a result of restructurings, industry
experts say.
   Although Manufacturers' prospectus didn't identify Mr.
Trump specifically, it said its portfolio of nonperforming
loans would increase by about 15% in the second quarter
"principally because of problems being experienced by one of
the corporation's major real estate customers." A bank
official identified the customer as Mr. Trump.
   Manufacturers' nonperforming loan portfolio, exclusive of
Third World debt, stood at $1.04 billion as of March 31.
   Bank industry sources said Mr. Trump's other major bank
lenders -- Citicorp, Bankers Trust and Chase -- would almost
certainly place the portion of their loans to Mr. Trump on
which interest payments have been deferred on nonperforming
status as well. Under a tentative agreement between Mr. Trump
and the banks this week, interest payments on some $850
million of loans have been deferred in exchange for an
additional five-year, $65 million loan that will enable Mr.
Trump to avoid defaults on debt agreements.
   A spokesman for Chase said that some portion of the bank's
loans to Mr. Trump would be placed on nonperforming status,
but not loans on which Mr. Trump continues to make interest
payments. Other banks refused to comment on their treatment
of the Trump loans.
   Additionally, two New Jersey banks with substantial loans
to Mr. Trump -- First Fidelity Bancorp. and Midlantic Corp.
-- refused to disclose how they're dealing with their loans
to Mr. Trump. However, First Fidelity earlier said it would
set aside as much as $300 million for past-due loans in the
second quarter, a portion of which is believed to be loans to
Mr. Trump.
