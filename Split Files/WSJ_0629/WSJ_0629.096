   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
a former Robinson-Humphrey Co. broker settled charges that he
violated securities laws by defrauding at least 18
professional football players.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Oscar Ayala, now a
salesman at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit in Marietta,
Ga., consented to the entry of a permanent injunction
agreeing not to violate securities laws in the future.

   Three weeks ago, the SEC filed a complaint against Mr.
Ayala, alleging that he defrauded football players who held
accounts at Robinson-Humphrey starting in 1988. The SEC,
which didn't identify the players, alleged that Mr. Ayala
misappropriated at least $1 million for personal use instead
of purchasing securities for his clients.
   Neither Mr. Ayala nor his attorney could be reached for
comment.
