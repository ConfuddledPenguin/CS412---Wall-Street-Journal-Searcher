   The Koppel facility, located in Koppel, Pa., contains a
melt shop installed in 1985 and has the capacity to produce
400,000 tons of steel products annually. The Ambridge
facility, located in nearby Ambridge, Pa., contains a
tube-making facility installed in 1976 designed to make
specialty tubing including bearing, mechanical, pressure and
oil country tubing. Both facilities were idled in 1988.
   The acquisition would allow NS to expand its tubular and
bar markets.
