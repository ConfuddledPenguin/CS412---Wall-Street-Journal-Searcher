   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Dennison Manufacturing Co. said it
and Avery International Corp. received requests from the
Antitrust Division of the Justice Department for additional
information on their merger.
   Pasadena, Calif.-based Avery and Dennison, based here,
agreed last month to merge in a stock swap with an indicated
value of $456 million. The merger would create one of the
largest office-products concerns in the U.S. with combined
annual sales of about $2.5 billion.

   The companies said the requests from the department were
anticipated and will extend the waiting period before the
merger can close.
   They said they will respond promptly to the requests and
expect to complete the merger in September.
