   WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden intensified the agency's battle with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, accusing the
commodities regulator of trying to "disguise facts" and
"distort" information.
   Mr. Breeden also said action is needed "to eliminate the
unsafe practices and rampant speculation in the futures
market." That comment is likely to strike fear into the
commodities exchanges, which may fall partly under SEC
oversight if a Bush administration-sponsored bill passes
Congress.

   The statements show Mr. Breeden abandoning the
more-conciliatory tone he had recently taken toward the
futures exchanges. In recent weeks, he has suggested that he
simply wanted to offer more protection to exchange customers
and to make sure those markets maintained sufficiently high
margins, or the good faith money needed to trade.
   In a rebuke to CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm, an obviously
angered Mr. Breeden vehemently supported his agency's May
report about the stock-market mini-crash last Oct. 13.
Earlier this week, Mrs. Gramm offered her own scathing
critique of the SEC report, accusing the SEC of "selectively
misleading" the public about the cause of the plunge.
   Mr. Breeden said the SEC "stands by the report and every
word in it." He went on to blast the CFTC's separate report
on the 6.9% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   While the SEC focused on the 80-minute period of the day
when the average fell most of its 190.58 points, Mr. Breeden
said that the CFTC averaged activity over the full day.
"That's a little bit like saying that except for a period of
time from 7 a.m. to noon, Pearl Harbor Day was a good day and
on average there weren't many problems," he fumed.
