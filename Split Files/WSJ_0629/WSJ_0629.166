   Altos Computer Systems Inc., a San Jose, Calif., maker of
multiuser computer networks, said it is engaged in talks with
the Acer Group regarding possible acquisition of Altos at a
proposed cash purchase price of $8.35 a share, or about $90
million.
   Altos said material terms remain to be negotiated with
Acer Group, a Taiwan-based maker of clones of personal
computers made by International Business Machine Corp. The
price now under discussion would represent a 60% premium over
Altos's stock price, which recently had languished at about
$5.3758 following several quarters of troubled performance.

   Although the takeover prospects weren't formally announced
until yesterday, Altos's stock took an anticipatory jump on
Wednesday to close at $7.375 in national over-the-counter
trading. Yesterday, Altos closed at $7.625, up 25 cents.
   Altos has suffered recent losses and stock-price erosion
due to inventory problems and new product start-up costs. In
its fiscal third quarter ended March 14, Altos posted a loss
of $1.7 million or 16 cents a share, on sales of $32.6
million.
   Altos President Ron Conway said he hopes negotiations will
be concluded "imminently." However, Altos cautioned in a
press release that there can be no assurance that the two
companies will reach a definitive agreement.
