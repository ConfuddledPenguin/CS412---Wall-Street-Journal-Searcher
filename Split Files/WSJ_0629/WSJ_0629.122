   LOS ANGELES -- The CBS network, attempting to get a
foothold in the lucrative late-night programming arena, plans
to offer a lineup of action and adventure shows aimed at
luring a younger, male audience.
   CBS Inc. is struggling to make a comeback from its failed
"Pat Sajak Show," which it canceled in April after 14 months
of dismal ratings.

   At stake is a share of the $429 million in advertising
revenue earned by the three major broadcast networks in the
11:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. period. Last year, CBS's share was only
$104 million, compared with $264 million for rival National
Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co. Capital
Cities/ABC Inc. took in only $61 million, but the network
only provides a half hour of late-night programming.
   CBS, staying clear of talk shows, will air original
episodes of five action series, beginning in January 1991.
   The new shows are "Judgment Night," about a judge who
plays by the rules by day, but goes by his own rules at night
in handing out justice; "Paris Steele," about an American
military officer who becomes an overseas operative for the
U.S. government; "Sweating Bullets," about a former agent for
the Drug Enforcement Agency who becomes a private detective;
"Slick," which centers on a jet pilot/jungle mercenary; and
"Scene of the Crime," an anthology mystery series.
   A new half-hour series by veteran producer Norman Lear,
"Jody Gordon and the News," will air at 12:40 a.m., beginning
in October.
   "We're attempting to reach young adults, who increasingly
tend to watch late-night television," said Rod Perth, vice
president of late-night programming.
   Advertisers, however, are skeptical that so-called
checkerboard programming -- airing a different show in the
same time period on consecutive nights -- will work in
late-night. "It's going to be very tough," said Betsy Frank,
a senior vice-president at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Inc.
"Viewers in late-night are used to consistency. . . ."
   Mr. Perth said that the shows were "compatible" and had
cross-promotional opportunities, although he declined to be
specific. "CBS was successful with movies years ago and
that's the ultimate checkerboarding," he said.
   CBS also faces another challenge: getting affiliates to
actually broadcast its shows. Since the demise of the Sajak
show, CBS's late-night shows at 11:30 p.m. are aired on only
80% of the 200-plus affiliates. Currently, CBS airs repeats
of "Wiseguy" and "21 Jump Street." At 12:30 a.m., that number
plummets to approximately 65%. And 12 of CBS's top 50
affiliates currently don't air any CBS late-night show.
   In comparison, 99% of NBC's affiliates air "The Tonight
Show Starring Johnny Carson" and "Late Night With David
Letterman."
