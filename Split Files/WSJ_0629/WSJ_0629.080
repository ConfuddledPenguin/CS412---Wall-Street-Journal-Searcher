   The long-distance business remained the fast-growth line
in the second quarter for the telecommunications industry.
   Except for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. with its
steep new credit-card costs, long-distance companies are
expected to post earnings gains of 20% to 25%, matching the
pace of the last few quarters. But new rate structures and
caps on regulated profit are likely to make second-quarter
reports for the regional Bell telephone companies rather
dull.

   For the Baby Bells, "the quarter's a yawner," said Ned
Shadek, vice president of Putnam Cos. in Boston. Earnings
generally are expected to be only 4% to 6% higher than in the
year-earlier period.
   In many cases, the bland earnings outlook is due to new
state regulatory structures that require up-front rate cuts.
Pacific Telesis Group, for example, is feeling the pinch of a
new rate structure in California that took effect in January.
The $391 million reduction is expected to erode earnings for
at least one year at normally robust PacTel. Analysts predict
the San Francisco-based company's earnings will drop about
8.9% to about 72 cents a share, compared with 79 cents a
share in the year-earlier quarter, when the company earned
$325 million on revenue of $2.4 billion.
   "These companies are willing to take up-front earnings
dilutions with the faith that they can make profits happen in
the long run," Putnam's Mr. Shadek said.
   Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. have room
to grow under newly determined regulatory ceilings for
earnings, said Dan Reingold, a telecommunications analyst at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. He anticipates Bell
Atlantic earnings of 90 cents a share, up about 3% from 87
cents a share in the year-earlier quarter, and Nynex earnings
of $1.52 a share, up about 7% from $1.42.
   "But I don't see any big surprises looming in the second
quarter," Mr. Reingold said.
   GTE Corp. is expected to outperform most other local
telephone companies, with anticipated earnings of $1.11 a
share, up about 10% from the year-earlier period, said Frank
J. Governali, a telecommunications analyst at First Boston
Corp. in New York. GTE is faring better, he said, because the
company isn't experiencing any negative impact from adoption
of regulatory structures and has taken major cost-cutting
steps.
   Analysts foresee quarterly earnings for BellSouth Corp.
growing 9% to 95 cents a share in the second quarter from 87
cents a year ago. They attribute the improvement to a 3.5% to
4% increase in access-line growth and 10% growth in volume
(minutes of use). For Southwestern Bell Corp., which enjoyed
an unusually strong quarter last year with help of a regional
economic resurgence, earnings are expected to drop 4.5% to 83
cents a share from 87 cents.
   Moreover, analysts aren't worried about excessive risk in
efforts by the Bells to expand abroad. As examples of what
analysts generally consider prudent diversification, they
cited the $2.5 billion acquisition of the New Zealand
telephone system by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, as well as
the joint venture of Bell Atlantic and U S West Inc. with the
government of Czechoslovakia to build a cellular telephone
system and a public data network in that country.
   "Those purchases stick with the principles of phone lines
and cellular. It's not like Nynex going out and buying a
{retail} computer business," Mr. Shadek said. Similarly, U S
West's expansion abroad into cable television in the United
Kingdom and Hong Kong, "are transferrable skills" if the Baby
Bells are allowed eventually to enter the U.S. cable
industry, he said.
   Analyst see U S West earnings at 77 cents a share, up 8%
from 71 cents in the year-earlier period.
   Although the regional Bells' earnings will be
"uneventful," the quarter shows steady demand growth of 3% in
access lines and 7% to 8% in call volumes, plus 50% to 60%
growth in cellular communications, said Jack B. Grubman, a
securities analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York. He also
considers revenue from customized calling features and data
communications to be strong.
   In Mr. Grubman's view, earning projections for
long-distance companies are "good, but not inspiring." Costs
associated with AT&amp;T's Universal credit-card business,
introduced in March, are damping earnings. On Wednesday,
analysts lowered second-quarter estimates to about 58 cents a
share from earlier expectations of about 72 cents a share.
AT&amp;T earned $699 million, or 65 cents a share, on revenue of
$9.26 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   "AT&amp;T is incurring more start-up costs, $100 million or
so, than they thought they would. But what is happening with
AT&amp;T {the credit-card project} is outside of the overall
industry dynamics," Mr. Grubman said.
   Analysts anticipate MCI Communications Corp. will post
profit of 67 cents a share, up 20% from 56 cents a share in
the year-earlier period. Mr. Grubman said he expects 20%
revenue growth to about $1.9 billion compared with $1.59
billion in the 1989 second quarter.
   "That is strong, but down from last year's 30% clip in the
second quarter. MCI is becoming a bigger company, and it is
tough to keep the same growth," Mr. Grubman said.
   United Telecommunications Inc., the Kansas City-based
owner of US Sprint long-distance service, is expected to post
about 20% revenue growth in the second quarter. Earnings are
projected at 53 cents a share, compared with 43 cents a share
a year earlier, when the company earned $100 million.
