   TOKYO -- Japan's May steel exports dropped 22% from a year
earlier as producers continued to direct their efforts at the
robust domestic market, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation
said.
   Shipments in May slipped to 1,344,000 metric tons, with
declines in most markets. Exports were down 1.6% from April.
A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.
