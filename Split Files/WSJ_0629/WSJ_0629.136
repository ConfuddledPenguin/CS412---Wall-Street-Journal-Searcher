   Morrison Knudsen Corp., Boise, Idaho, said it was chosen
to manage construction of a $219 million plant renovation for
General Motors Corp.
   The auto maker's truck and bus group awarded the contract
to the construction and engineering company to manage a
retrofitting and retooling of GM's Shreveport, La., assembly
plant. A new model of light pickup truck is to be produced
there for the 1993 model year.

   Production will involve three assembly complexes and two
metal fabricating plants. Preconstruction services are set to
begin immediately in Shreveport, with the bulk of the
construction and tooling installation taking place over the
next two years, Morrison Knudsen said.
