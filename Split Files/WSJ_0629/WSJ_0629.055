   PITTSBURGH -- Mellon Bank Corp. said its Grant Street
National Bank unit, which is in liquidation, has deposited
$65.7 million with Continental Bank N.A., trustee for holders
of Grant Street's Class A-2 Extendible Pay-Through Notes.
   The deposit is sufficient to retire the remaining $61.2
million outstanding A-2 Notes on Nov. 1, 1990, their first
call date, the bank said.
