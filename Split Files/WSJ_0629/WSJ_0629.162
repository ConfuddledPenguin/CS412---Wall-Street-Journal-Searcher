   Pantera's Corp. said a U.S. bankruptcy court judge
approved a disclosure statement for a plan of reorganization
that would merge the company into its Pizza Inn Inc.
subsidiary and reconstitute it primarily as a franchise
service firm.
   Pantera's, a Dallas-based owner and franchiser of Pizza
Inn restaurants, would assume the name Pizza Inn Inc. under
the plan and sell most of its 100 company-owned restaurants
to existing or new franchisees. It would then concentrate on
improved marketing and operations support for franchise
restaurants, which currently number over 300, the company
said.

   Pantera's said the plan would give current shareholders a
5% stake in the reorganized company, while giving unsecured
creditors a 62.5% stake. Management would receive 32.5% over
several years. Secured creditors would be repaid over a
period of five years, the company said.
   Pantera's said the plan has the support of secured and
unsecured creditors and of franchisees, and will be put to a
vote by creditors and holders prior to July 18.
   Jeff Rogers, president of Pizza Inn, said the company has
been experiencing "new record average unit sales" recently,
adding that "interest in international locations is
increasing dramatically."
