   The battle against smog will have a home front, too:
Consumers may struggle with damper hairdos, longer-drying
paint and frozen windshield-washer fluid.
   Hundreds of consumer products containing smog-causing
ingredients may have to be changed in the name of clean air.
The sweeping legislation pending in Congress would require
the Environmental Protection Agency to study consumer
products and issue regulations aimed at reducing their
smog-forming potential. Meanwhile, states already are
pressing their own smog attacks.

   California and some other states have required the
reduction of smog-inducing solvents in paints. California
also has adopted standards that will take effect in 1993 for
antiperspirants, and it is considering regulating 20 to 30
other products, including cologne, nail-polish remover and
windshield-washer fluid.
   Meanwhile, Texas has required changes in windshield-washer
fluid used in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. And this summer,
New York state plans to propose restrictions for the New York
metropolitan area covering antiperspirants and deodorants,
air fresheners and hair spray.
   Some changes, industry contends, are to the detriment of
consumers. In Dallas, windshield fluids that meet state
anti-smog rules don't work in freezing temperatures. In
California, paint makers have abandoned some paints that meet
new rules because they aren't satisfied with the
paint-spreading performance.
   But Dean Simeroth, an official of the California Air
Resources Board, says the complaints are overblown. "Advances
in technology," he says, "will keep acceptable products on
the shelf."
   The products in question contain one or more volatile
organic compounds, or VOCs, which react with other chemicals
in sunlight to form smog. Generally, these compounds,
typically an alcohol or hydrocarbon, are found in the
solvent, which carries an active ingredient that actually
holds the hair or cleans the windshield. However, some active
ingredients themselves contain VOCs, too.
   Either way, the compounds often are crucial to today's
products: It's the smog-forming component that helps paints
spread evenly and helps disinfectants in household cleaners
kill germs.
   Compared with contributors to smog like auto exhaust,
individual consumer products release relatively tiny amounts
of smog-producing substances. But their ubiquity -- coupled
with the fact that all of the easy reductions have already
been squeezed from larger sources -- have made this area ripe
for pollution reduction.
   While questioning the need to change some products,
companies nationwide are hard at work redesigning products so
they won't contribute to smog. "Up to three or four years
ago, no one ever heard of VOCs," says Ralph Engel, president
of the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association in
Washington. "Now everyone is working on" the problem, he
says.
   Here are some of the likely changes for a variety of
products:
                                                                                                       

   HAIR SPRAYS: Companies will have to attack on two fronts:
the aerosol propellant, generally a hydrocarbon, and the
solvent in the hair spray itself. The solvent, consisting of
water and alcohol, evaporates, leaving behind a resin that
actually holds the hair in place. Changes to fight smog may
threaten the dry look.
   Compressed gases may be usable as an alternative to the
hydrocarbon propellant, but they often don't dissolve as well
in the alcohol, says chemist Joyce Graf of the Cosmetic,
Toiletry and Fragrance Association. Reducing the alcohol
content of the solvent would lower the smog-forming potential
but might also result in less uniform evaporation, also
leaving hair wetter, Ms. Graf says. Non-aerosol dispensers
produce a wetter spray.
   Thomas Pallone, a vice president at Alberto Culver Co.,
Melrose Park. Ill., says reducing the harmful ingredients in
hair spray will mean "far wetter hair" as the industry relies
more on water, which dries more slowly than alcohol. On hot,
humid days, he says, hair might take 20 minutes to dry,
compared with a few minutes with today's products. The price
may rise, too.
   But California officials are confident that the state's
planned hair-spray regulations will result in acceptable
products. "By 1993, nobody will notice any difference," says
Mr. Simeroth.
                                                                                                       

   PAINT: To reduce smog, manufacturers in some states have
to cut the level of solvent, which helps paint flow onto
surfaces and form a uniform film. Depending on the type of
paint, a low-solvent brand might require more frequent
applications, take longer to dry and do so unevenly. It also
could cost more than the paints available today, according to
manufacturers who are already complying with pollution rules
in California and other states.
   Robert Wendoll, environmental regulation administrator for
Dunn Edwards Corp., Los Angeles, says the quality may never
be as good as in high-solvent paint. If not, he says, people
may simply use more paint, which could actually increase,
rather than reduce, smog-forming emissions. His company and
Benjamin Moore &amp; Co., Montvale, N.J., have stopped selling
some paints in certain areas because of dissatisfaction with
quality.
   James Sainsbury, manager of product regulation for big
paint maker Glidden Co., a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC, says the proliferation of pollution rules is
accelerating the trend toward wider use of latex paints,
which contain fewer harmful solvents and which many consumers
already prefer for a variety of surfaces. Reducing the
solvents in oil-based paints, which many people use on window
sills, doorways and trim among other places, produces a
thicker film that won't dry as well, he says.
   The California Air Resources Board says many low-solvent
paints may require more advance surface preparation. But it
says the products being sold today generally don't require
more frequent painting and perform about as well as the
high-solvent brands. The board says consumers probably won't
notice any difference, and that quality will only improve as
technology gains.
   Last week, the air quality management district for the San
Francisco Bay area agreed to ban aerosol spray paints that
don't meet strict emission levels by Jan. 1. A spokeswoman
for the board, which is under federal court order to reduce
emissions from these products, says there are "very few"
spray paints available today that meet the standard.
                                                                                                       

   WINDSHIELD-WASHER FLUID: To comply with new rules in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area, manufacturers have had to remove the
volatile compounds, typically methanol, that prevent the
liquid from freezing and keep it from beading up or leaving a
film.
   Chem Lab Products Inc., Ontario, Calif., replaced the
compounds in its fluid with a substance similar to an
ingredient used in fancy shampoos. But algae started growing
in the new product while it sat on the shelves, says Dana
Somesla, chief chemist for Chem Lab, so the company had to
add an algae inhibitor. (Texas may allow a small percentage
of methanol or ethanol to help deal with this problem.)
   Mr. Somesla says the company has gotten good responses
from customers for its low-polluting fluid, which costs about
the same as fluid with methanol. But the product really
hasn't been tested in a Dallas winter yet, and Chem Lab
hasn't come up with a marketable product that works in
freezing temperatures. Chem Lab says that it is working on
such a fluid, but that it will probably cost twice as much.
   Looking on the bright side, some companies predict that
consumers may actually seek out new or revised products that
help cut smog, even if they cost a bit more or don't work
quite as well as today's goods. Says Peter Gould, president
of Exxel Container Inc., a Somerset, N.J., maker of a
non-aerosol dispensing can, "We'll be seeing products that
deliver a close-enough performance and make people feel good
because they're doing something environmentally valid."
