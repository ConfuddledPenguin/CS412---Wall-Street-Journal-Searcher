   The North American forest products industry got glimmers
of good news in the second quarter, but most of the companies
are still expected to report substantially lower earnings,
compared with a year earlier.
   Major newsprint producers pushed though a price increase
of about 5% in June. Makers of uncoated white papers also
increased prices 5%. But markets and prices for linerboard
and containerboard weakened. Canadian producers of the
premium grade of market pulp kept prices stable, but they had
to slash production to do it. And a variety of operational
problems reduced output at many mills.

   Mark Diverio of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said he
expects the group of 18 companies he follows to report that
second-quarter earnings fell about 27% from a year earlier.
Within the group, several companies will report declines of
about 50%, he said.
   For example, Mr. Diverio expects Stone Container Corp. to
report net income of 60 cents a share for the second quarter,
down from $1.06 a share a year earlier. He sees Pentair Inc.
reporting a decline in second-quarter net to 40 cents a share
from 80 cents.
   Mr. Diverio said several companies were hurt by production
problems in the second quarter. Boise Cascade Corp., Champion
International Corp., Union Camp Corp. and Bowater Inc. are
among the companies that had operational problems in the
quarter, he said.
   Though there were variations by region, linerboard and
containerboard markets on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian
border were weak in the second quarter. "Discounts have been
getting a little wider," Raymond Kilroy, an analyst at
Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., said. Linerboard and
containerboard are used to make packaging.
   Uncoated white papers, photocopy and business-forms
papers, for example, "are looking a bit better," Mr. Kilroy
said. After prices drifted lower in the first quarter,
producers pushed through a series of 5% price increases in
the second quarter, Shearson's Mr. Diverio said.
   Canadian forest products companies are expected to repeat
their first-quarter performance and report even sharper
year-to-year earnings declines than their U.S. counterparts
do.
   The fortunes of many big Canadian companies are tied to
newsprint or market pulp. Canada is the world's largest
producer of both products.
   Led by Abitibi-Price Inc. of Toronto, most big Canadian
and U.S. producers raised newsprint prices effective June 1,
too late to give much of a boost to the latest quarter's
results. The benchmark Eastern U.S. list price for newsprint
increased 5.4% to $685 a metric ton from $650. A similar
increase took effect in other markets, where the pricing
system is slightly different. Newsprint is sold now at about
a 19% discount from list price, so actual selling prices in
the Eastern U.S. rose to about $555 a metric ton from $525 a
ton. A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.
   The newsprint price increase may only be temporary. Many
analysts and newsprint buyers said that if new labor
contracts are signed in Eastern Canada without a strike, the
price increase will collapse. Fear of a strike at mills in
the region allowed producers to push the price increase
through, they said.
   Drastic production cuts hurt Canadian producers of market
pulp. "They will have some surprisingly low results," John
Johnson, an analyst at Richardson Greenshields of Canada
Ltd., said.
   A sudden surge in inventories at the beginning of the year
prompted producers of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp,
the premium grade of market pulp, to idle their mills
temporarily.
   The producers are trying to prevent a price slide. Small
discounts are available in the spot market, but these didn't
widen in the second quarter, analysts said. The list price of
the premium pulp is $830 a metric ton. But while producers
are selling the northern softwood pulp at or near list price,
they are selling a lot less of it.
   "We're going to see very disappointing earnings from
pulp," Mr. Johnson said. Canadian concerns with big market
pulp operations include Repap Enterprises Inc., Canadian
Pacific Forest Products Ltd. and Fletcher Challenge Canada
Ltd., a subsidiary of Fletcher Challenge Ltd. of New Zealand.
This month, Fletcher Challenge Canada cut its quarterly
dividend in half, joining a long list of big Canadian
concerns that have cut their payouts.
   On the West Coast, Canadian forest products companies had
another problem. Heavy rains "fouled up logging," Robert
Duncan, an analyst at Wood Gundy Inc., said. "We've had a
real disaster from a weather standpoint." Rain makes it
difficult for logging crews to get their heavy trucks into
and out of the woods.
