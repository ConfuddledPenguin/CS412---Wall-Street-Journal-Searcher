   NEW YORK -- The small investors' renewed hunger for stock
funds may already be waning. While stock funds pulled in $4.4
billion more than they surrendered to departing shareholders
in May, fund executives say the pace of sales slowed
significantly in June.
   "May was a fabulous month for us," says Daniel Carper, a
partner at Lord Abbett &amp; Co. "June is going to be off some
from May. The decrease has come on the equity side."

   According to data released yesterday by the Investment
Company Institute, the trade group for the mutual fund
industry, the net inflow into stock funds in May was $4.4
billion -- the best showing by stock funds since April 1987.
   But fund groups report much slower inflows in June. Much
of this sales slowdown seems to have come during the past two
weeks, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid back after
hitting a new high of 2935.89 on June 15.
   "Overall, our cash flow was stronger in the first half of
the month than in the second half," says Gavin Quill, a
marketing research analyst with Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark.
   June's sluggish sales followed four months of huge
stock-fund inflows. So far this year, stock funds have posted
net inflows of $12.1 billion, versus $5.8 billion for all of
1989, according to ICI data. (These figures include sales
less redemptions, plus the net effect of switches between
stock funds and other funds. Reinvested dividends are
excluded.)
   The outlook for stock fund inflows in the months ahead
isn't nearly as promising, however. A recent survey by the
University of Michigan Survey Research Center, conducted for
Fidelity Investments, found that only 19% of mutual fund
owners plan to invest in stock funds during the next three
months, down from 37% in April.
   Reversing a yearlong trend, stock fund managers turned
slightly more bullish in May, cutting back their cash
holdings to 11.3% of assets, down from 12.5% in April. Before
May, cash positions had risen almost continuously since March
1989.
   It seems stock fund managers didn't stay bullish for long,
according to statistics for the 57 stock funds tracked by
Indata, a service of Gordon, Haskett &amp; Co. The cash position
at these 57 stock funds gradually shrank from 12.5% of assets
at the end of March to 9.1% on June 15. But since then, cash
holdings have rebounded to 9.8%.
   Both broker-sold fund groups and direct marketers report
strong sales of new funds. T. Rowe Price's European Stock
Fund, launched March 1, is already up to $90 million. Lord
Abbett raised $87 million in May for its new Lord Abbett
Equity Fund, which guarantees return of investors' principal
after 10 years. The fund is now closed to new investors.
Prudential-Bache Multi-Sector Fund, an aggressive growth
fund, has raised $145 million since its launch in late May.
Vanguard's International Equity Index Fund, which was opened
in mid-May, has now pulled in $60 million.
   Both Dreyfus Corp. and Fidelity are now heavily
advertising their new Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index funds, but
it seems that all index funds are benefiting from the
publicity.
   Vanguard Group says its top selling stock fund this month
has been its S&amp;P 500 index fund, and both Colonial Group and
Rushmore Group report a surge of interest in their index
funds.
   Among older funds, international stock funds have been
this year's bestsellers, with net inflows of $3.2 billion.
Growth and income funds have been the second most popular
type of fund in 1990, pulling in almost $3.1 billion.
   Balanced funds, which hold both stocks and bonds, have
become big money magnets for some fund groups. The
top-selling stock fund this month at Franklin Resources was
its Franklin Income Fund. Massachusetts Financial Services
reports keen interest in its Total Return Trust, and Vanguard
says its three balanced funds all had healthy cash inflows in
June.
   After 10 months of hemorrhaging assets, junk-bond funds
posted net inflows of $57 million in May, and fund companies
such as Franklin, T. Rowe Price, Prudential-Bache and
Vanguard say cash continued to roll in during June.
   In May, bond and income fund sales rebounded from April,
when rising interest rates caused nervous investors to sell.
In May, bond funds -- excluding junk -- pulled in almost $2
billion of net new money, up from $229 million in April.
   But while junk inflows have turned positive,
municipal-bond funds are the current hot bond fund product.
   "Tax-exempts are continuing to increase their share of the
fund industry," says A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper
Analytical Services. "I think people may be reading
somebody's lips. At least at the state level, taxes seem
likely to go up. There's also a seasonable impact, as people
react after paying their taxes."
   Investors seem wary of longer-maturity bond funds. New
England Securities' best-selling bond fund in June was its
Investment Trust of Boston Premium Income Portfolio, which
holds bonds with an average duration of less than four years.
"I think that shows there's still a heck of a lot of
uncertainty in the market," says Henry Schmelzer, an
executive vice president with New England Securities.
   The outlook for bond fund sales in the months ahead is
more promising. Michigan University found that 25% of
mutual-fund investors surveyed in June plan to invest in bond
funds over the next three months, up slightly from April. A
growing number of investors also think interest rates will go
down over the next year. "That augers well for all
fixed-income investments," says Michael Hines, a Fidelity
marketing vice president.
