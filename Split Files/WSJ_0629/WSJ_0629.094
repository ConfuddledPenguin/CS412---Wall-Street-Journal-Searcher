   MACLEAN HUNTER Ltd., Toronto, said it agreed to sell 150
million Canadian dollars (US$128.3 million) of 12.2%
debentures, maturing in 1995, to a group of underwriters
comprising Wood Gundy Inc., Toronto-Dominion Securities Inc.
and Burns Fry Ltd. Maclean Hunter, a publishing and
broadcasting company, said proceeds will be used to repay
short-term debt from last year's acquisition of Selkirk
Communications Ltd., a television and radio broadcaster based
in Toronto. Maclean Hunter said it expects to file a
preliminary short-form prospectus for the offering with
securities regulators shortly.
