   MINNEAPOLIS -- General Mills Inc. reported that net income
more than doubled in its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 27.
   Earnings in the quarter totaled $75.3 million, or 93 cents
a share, compared with $35.6 million, or 45 cents a share, a
year earlier, when discontinued operations reduced net by
$22.1 million, or 27 cents a share. Sales rose 18.6% to $1.7
billion from $1.4 billion.

   For the year, net income was lower, totaling $381.4
million, or $4.64 a share, compared with $414.3 million, or
$5.06 a share, previously. However, last year's net included
a $169 million gain from the sale of two retailing
businesses.
   For the year, earnings from continuing operations set a
record, totaling $373.7 million, or $4.55 a share, compared
with $315.3 million, or $3.85 a share, previously.
   Sales for fiscal 1990 rose 14.7% to a record $6.4 billion
from $5.6 billion.
   Both consumer foods and restaurants sectors achieved
double-digit sales and earnings gains for the year. Pacing
the food side was ready-to-eat cereals, which despite
capacity constraints increased its No. 2 share to 27% from
24.5% in fiscal 1989, the company said. Kellogg Co., which
lost share over the last 12 months, has about 39% of the $7
billion domestic ready-to-eat cereal business.
   General Mills stock rose on the news, closing at $90.125,
up $3.75, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
