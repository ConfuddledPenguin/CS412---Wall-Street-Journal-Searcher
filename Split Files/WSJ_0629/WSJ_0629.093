   As advertisers finish snapping up ad time for the fall TV
season, two onetime underdogs -- second-ranked ABC and the
fledgling Fox network -- are emerging as the big winners.
   Both Fox and ABC racked up the biggest gains in the
multibillion-dollar "upfront" market, a frenzied one-week
ritual when advertisers buy prime-time ad time for the coming
fall season. The two networks not only attracted a larger
share of dollars than ever before, but also saw the biggest
percentage gains in ad-time prices. They shone in a market,
though, that is hardly shaping up as outstanding: Industry
executives estimate advertisers spent at best about $4.3
billion on prime-time spots, a modest increase over the $4.2
billion they spent last year.

   "People want to be in a place that's growing. ABC and Fox
are both perceived to have upside potential," says Jon
Mandel, senior vice president and director of national
broadcast for Grey Advertising. Conversely, "a lot of people
feel NBC is dropping down and will continue to fall next
year," says Lou Schultz, an executive vice president of
Lintas.
   The Capital Cities/ABC network has been steadily closing
in on the once-commanding lead of NBC in prime-time, thanks
to hits like "The Wonder Years," "Roseanne" and the weird new
"Twin Peaks." Fox, meanwhile, rolled out a surprise hit this
year in "The Simpsons," an animated series about an obnoxious
family. Both networks also have a strong hold on the younger
audiences, and those from more urban areas, that advertisers
love.
   NBC, a unit of General Electric, still remains the
advertising leader, but it attracted fewer ad dollars this
year than last. According to industry executives, NBC pulled
in $1.5 billion, down from $1.7 billion a year ago. ABC
attracted almost $1.4 billion, up from almost $1.3 billion
last year, while CBS brought in about $900 million, down from
about $1 billion. News Corp.'s Fox still lagged behind the
others, with estimates ranging from $500 million to $550
million, but that figure jumped from just $300 million last
year. A big part of the gain, though, was inevitable, since
Fox has 12 hours of prime-time programming this year, up from
eight hours last year.
   ABC also rang up the biggest price increases, which
industry executives peg at close to 14%. NBC's increases were
in the low double-digits while CBS's were even lower. Fox saw
steeper percentage increases than any of the big three
networks, but Fox's ad time is still far cheaper than that of
its larger competitors.
   Network and agency executives initially expected the total
market to be a bit more robust, with total spending reaching
$4.4 billion or better. But while movie and beverage
companies saw healthy increases in spending, several other
product categories spent less than last year. Among the
laggards: retailers and auto companies -- which had fueled
the market with $700 million in spending last year, but which
fell by as much as $100 million this year.
   "A lot of people cut back because of the uncertainty" of
the economy, says Lintas's Mr. Schultz, adding, "In many
quarters of business, it's survival time." He says that a
number of packaged-goods companies he spoke with said ad
budgets "are way down, 10% to 20%." Other ad executives,
however, said some packaged-goods companies had strong
spending increases in the upfront market.
   Some advertisers may also have been put off by the three
major networks' overhaul this season of their traditional
audience-size guarantee system. The overhaul, which in effect
reduces the guarantees the networks traditionally promise
advertisers, led to a huge outcry by advertisers. Ironically,
it also gave a big boost to Fox, the only network to keep a
traditional guarantee policy. "Fox made out because it was
the only one that gave hard guarantees. That helped it
tremendously," Mr. Mandel of Grey Advertising says.
   H. Weller "Jake" Keever, who heads up sales for ABC,
concedes the new guarantee policy may have had some marginal
chilling effect, but nothing significant. "We only had two
people who said, `I'm cutting network {spending} because of
the policy.' I think a lot of people are irritated, but it
didn't affect the business," he says.
   The meager increase is another indication, too, of the
increasing fractionalization of media. Advertisers simply
don't need to rely solely on huge mass media like the
networks anymore. "A lot of money, we suspect, went to
unwired networks, syndication and cable," says Larry Hoffner,
who heads up sales for NBC. But he says he wasn't
disappointed with the upfront market: "We set realistic
goals, and we pretty much came out where we thought."

   Geer DuBois Taps Hayes
                                                                                                       

   Geer DuBois tapped John Hayes, executive vice president at
Ammirati &amp; Puris, as its president. He succeeds Peter Geer,
who becomes chairman, a position that has been vacant in
recent years.
   In a related move, Rodney Underwood, who joined Geer
DuBois a year ago as executive vice president and creative
director, was promoted to vice chairman and executive
creative director.
   The changes reunite Messrs. Hayes and Underwood, who
worked together in two earlier stints: during the late 1970s
and early 1980s at Scali, McCabe, Sloves and more recently at
Ammirati &amp; Puris.
   Ammirati has lost several top executives recently.
President Martin Puris called Mr. Hayes's new job "a great
opportunity. We're proud that we can supply talent for the
rest of the industry."
   Mr. Puris said Mr. Hayes won't be replaced; his
responsibilities will be divided among other Ammirati
executives.

previously had the account.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Roy Bostock, chief executive officer of D'Arcy
Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, was elected to the additional post of
chairman, as expected. He succeeds John S. Bowen, who is
retiring tomorrow and who was elected chairman emeritus. . .
. Backer Spielvogel Bates, a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC,
named Mathew G. Crisci executive vice president for its
Miller Brewing business. Mr. Crisci, formerly at
Chiat/Day/Mojo, fills a position left vacant by the departure
of Frank Assumma several months ago.
