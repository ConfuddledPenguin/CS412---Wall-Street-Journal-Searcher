   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa and Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney are trying to persuade their trading partners,
investors and creditors that the failure of the most recent
effort to amend the Canadian Constitution -- known in Canada
as the Meech Lake accord -- will not harm the Canadian
economy. Maybe. But at the moment, there is cause for worry.
   Mr. Bourassa has said he will engage in no more
constitutional talks. He says he is reconsidering his
constitutional options, and that he will rule out no option,
including "sovereignty." He has canceled celebration of the
July 1 national holiday.

   Even so, Mr. Bourassa probably is lagging behind his
voters. Nearly 60% of Quebeckers now say they favor
sovereignty. Almost half want outright independence. The
Conseil du Patronat, the employers' group that was the
bulwark of the anti-separation forces in the 1980 Quebec
referendum, announced Tuesday that it wouldn't be taking
sides in future debates over the province's adhesion to the
Canadian confederation.
   Quebec's drift toward autonomy apparently is being
welcomed by many English Canadians. Some, especially in
British Columbia, hope that a weakening of the Canadian
confederation would mean more self-rule for their own
province. Others simply are tired of the endless
constitutional wrangling.
   An autonomous Quebec need not be a disaster for the
country. Both of the province's major political parties are
committed to free trade and polls show that Quebeckers are
among the most pro-American of Canadians.
   Whether Quebec stays in Canada or leaves, however, matters
less than whether it can overcome the temptation to cuff
around people like Harry Schick. Mr. Schick is the owner of a
pastry store in a suburb of Montreal. According to the
Montreal Gazette, he was charged on Feb. 28 with violating
Quebec's language laws. His offense: posting a sign in his
window with the word "welcome" hand-lettered in 33 languages.
This sort of behavior hardly reflects a culture that wants to
join an increasingly liberal world trading system.
   It's not just language that evokes the Quebec government's
meddlesome instincts. It is true that the province has
enjoyed an entrepreneurial boom since the 1982 recession. And
in a recent poll for Maclean's magazine, Quebeckers put more
faith in business, and less in governments and unions, than
either English Canadians or Americans. But Quebec remains an
excessively subsidized and regulated economy. Its
corporations are disturbingly dependent on ideologically
motivated investments by the $30 billion provincial
employees' pension fund.
   When Quebec shook off its parochial and authoritarian past
in the 1960s, its economy roared forward. Even greater
opportunities are open to the province today. But the
benefits of North American economic integration come with an
important condition: They can only be seized by those who
understand that for an economy to grow, it isn't only trade
that must be free.
