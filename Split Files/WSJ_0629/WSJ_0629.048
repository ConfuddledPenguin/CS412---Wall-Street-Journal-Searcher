   Software companies should post strong gains in the second
quarter, bucking the trend across much of the rest of the
computer industry.
   Personal-computer software makers are expected to do
especially well, led by Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development
Corp., while companies that sell minicomputer and mainframe
software will grow more slowly. This division mirrors
relative industry growth rates.

   In PC software, Microsoft continues to dominate the field,
and it shows no signs of slowing down. This week the Redmond,
Wash., company said its new Windows program -- a graphic
enhancement of the ubiquitous DOS operating-system software
-- has exceeded its most aggressive predictions. David
Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, forecasts
that Microsoft will have sold 500,000 copies of the program
between its May 22 introduction and June 30.
   Mr. Readerman expects Microsoft to report net income of
$75 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with $45.5
million, or 40 cents a share, a year ago. He sees revenue
rising 57%, to $345 million.
   Lotus, too, should report another stellar quarter. But the
worry is whether the big Cambridge, Mass.-based company can
keep it up.
   "Lotus is losing momentum -- and it will become apparent
in the second half," says Richard G. Sherlund, an analyst
with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. He is one of the few analysts with
an outright "sell" recommendation on Lotus, arguing that its
product cycle has peaked and that the company can't deliver
strong new growth until 1991.
   By most analysts' estimates, Lotus's net income for the
quarter ending June 30 will more than double to $26 million,
or about 55 cents a share, with sales rising about 35% to an
estimated $180 million.
   But the numbers fall off sharply after that, Mr. Sherlund
says. After year-to-year earnings tripled in the first half,
the pace will slow to 10% for the rest of the year, he says.
Sales growth will be better, rising 20% in the second half
compared with 35% in the first. Still, "investors aren't
going to know how long they'll have to wait" until new
products fuel new growth, he says.
   Looming on the horizon, too, is a new onslaught from
Microsoft. Industry executives say Microsoft is hoping to
leapfrog Lotus's top-of-the-line spreadsheet later this year
with a powerful new version of its Excel product. And
Microsoft's line takes advantage of Windows 3.0, a new
program that Lotus's 1-2-3 line hasn't yet adopted. Lotus
isn't expected to have a Windows-based 1-2-3 ready until
early next year -- if everything goes well. And the company
historically hasn't been very good at meeting product
deadlines.
   Michele Preston, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Co., doubts Lotus
will be bowled over by Microsoft. "People aren't going to
switch to Windows overnight," she says. "Customers love
1-2-3, and have a lot invested in it. That's not going to
change anytime soon."
   Benefiting from the booming PC software business is
Westwood, Mass.-based Corporate Software Inc., a big
distributor. "Corporate Software is in a good position to
profit from the strength of the industry," says Scott M.
Smith, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He expects
the company to post a 27% gain in net income, to 20 cents a
share, on a 56% boost in revenue, to $48 million.
   Among smaller PC software makers, Ashton-Tate Corp. should
break even at two cents a share, on a 12% sales gain to $67
million, compared with loss of 75 cents a share a year ago,
Mr. Smith says. The firm was hurt by delays in a new version
of its flagship database product. Goldman Sachs' Mr. Sherlund
isn't as optimistic, forecasting a five-cent-a-share loss on
essentially flat revenue of $58 million.
   Computer Associates International Inc., the largest
software company, is expected to recover from a slump in the
quarter a year ago brought on by its acquisition of
money-losing Cullinet Software Inc. The Cullinet business --
mostly mainframe software -- continued to hurt results in the
quarter ending June 30 and is down 50% from levels a year
ago, estimates Timothy R. McCollum, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. But he sees the company gaining momentum
through the rest of the fiscal year, which closes March 31,
1991.
   Mr. McCollum expects the Garden City, N.Y.-based software
giant to earn about 10 cents a share, or $19 million, up 77%
from a year ago, while revenue should rise just 3%, to $311
million. Mr. McCollum is more cautious on the company's
performance than other analysts, whose estimates range from
12 cents to 15 cents a share.
   Oracle Systems Corp., whose database software spans
desktop to room-size computers, should bounce back in the
fourth quarter ended May 31, following a nasty third-quarter
surprise that sparked a huge sell-off of the stock in March.
Investors were stunned when the fast-growing company reported
its first flat quarter in years, snapping a spectacular
streak of double-digit earnings growth.
   David G. Bayer of Montgomery Securities expects Oracle,
based in Belmont, Calif.,to report that net income doubled,
to $69 million, or 50 cents a share, on a 69% increase in
revenue, to $365 million.
   Mr. Bayer is a bull on Oracle -- the Street consensus is
closer to 45 cents a share. But a few analysts think Oracle
could have a surprise in store. "They had a good wind-up to
the quarter, and I think they'll beat the forecasts," Dean
Witter's Mr. McCollum says.
