   NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence declined significantly as
the index compiled by the Conference Board fell almost five
points this month to 102.5 from May's revised 107.3.
   The monthly survey, conducted for the board by National
Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, found consumers less
optimistic about the immediate future, particularly on the
issue of jobs. The Conference Board is a nonprofit research
center.

   Less than 24% of all survey participants felt that jobs
are "plentiful," a three point drop for the month. The survey
uses the year 1985 as an index base of 100 and covers 5,000
households throughout the U.S.
   Opinion is slightly less favorable on current business
conditions, and on expectations for the next six months.
Those who fear there will be fewer jobs now outnumber those
who expect there will be more.
   Slightly more respondents expect worse business conditions
and a personal income decrease. Plans to spend money over the
next six months on automobiles, homes, major appliances and
vacations declined slightly.
   Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference
Board's consumer research center, said, "While the measure of
consumer confidence is now lower than it has been in more
than two and a half years, there are no indications of
impending recession."
