   OTC stocks overpowered those listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and posted sharp gains.
   Technology stocks gave the OTC market its muscle, traders
say. But the vitality failed to spread to bank and thrift
shares, which eased on the day.

   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.49, or 0.76%, to 460.38,
while the Big Board's composite index added only 0.68%. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.58%.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,088 to 841, while volume
totaled 148.8 million shares, up from 137.5 million shares.
   Gains by Apple Computer helped draw interest to the OTC
market's technology issues after Cowen &amp; Co. recommended the
stock. Apple opened at 42 3/4 and ended at 43, up 1 1/2
points from Wednesday's close. The stock led the most-active
list with volume of more than 2.2 million shares.
   Christine Callies, market analyst at Cowen &amp; Co., says the
strength in the technology sector may mean that the group has
a couple more quarters of gains ahead.
   She claims that the recent strong performance by the group
is due to institutions rebuilding their positions in the
stocks after having neglected the sector for much of the past
two years.
   Large shareholder bases generally produce very large price
moves, Ms. Callies says, and the technology sector may
already be taking such a ride.
   "Bases of that significance generally fuel rallies
sustainable over nine months to a year, as opposed to just
nine weeks," she says. The stocks can continue the bulk of
their advance on relatively low volume for some time because
so much stock has been taken out of circulation, she adds.
   "The only way to bring new stock into the market is to
keep raising prices," she says.
   Ms. Callies estimates that the group has about six more
months of gains ahead before prices begin to show some
serious weakness.
   Others worry that falling corporate profits in the
quarters ahead could hurt the stocks.
   Ray Hirsch, senior portfolio manager at IDS Financial
Services, says earnings gains are going to be more and more
difficult to come by.
   Export markets overseas have fueled much of the growth
that has made technology stocks popular this year, Mr. Hirsch
says. Now those markets are slowing down, following the U.S.
economy's lead, he warns.
   "The U.S. entered a period of slowing growth earlier than
Japan or Europe," he says, adding that now it's their turn.
   That should stall much of the growth in growth companies,
leaving stock prices moving in a range about 5% above or
below their current levels, he says.
   Cowen's Ms. Callies believes earnings are "troughing,"
however, and that the worst of weakening profits is past.
   "What is behind isn't as important as what's ahead," she
says, adding that the second-quarter earnings reports -- due
late in July -- are history. Ms. Callies looks for the
technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite Index to reach 500 or a
little more before the end of the year.
   Ms. Callies concedes that technology stocks are
"exceptionally market sensitive," and says a major downturn
in the overall market environment could sap the sector's
strength.
   But many market watchers have high hopes that lower
interest rates will save stocks from a serious tumble.
   Frank Cappiello, president of McCullough Andrews &amp;
Cappiello, believes that the Federal Reserve will ease rates
as early as this summer, saving the over-leveraged economy
from the massacre of a recession.
   That means those with the moxie to buy stocks now will
make money later on.
   "They are going to have to give by at least 50 basis
points," Mr. Cappiello says. "That's what it will take to
avoid a recession."
   Among technology stocks gaining, Conner Peripherals surged
2 5/8 to 28 5/8, Intel added 1/4 to 46 1/8, Microsoft rose
1/4 to 76 1/2, and Medar gained 3/8 to 2 1/4.
   Nike leaped 4 1/4 to 77 1/2 on volume of nearly 1.3
million shares. The company said this morning that it expects
to report profit for the fourth quarter ended May 31 to total
between $1.70 to $1.75 a share. The outlook is well ahead of
previous estimates of $1.50 to $1.60 a share for the quarter.
The improved outlook is largely due to a lower-than-expected
tax rate and a revision in the company's LIFO inventory
reserves, Nike said.
   Medical Imaging Centers made the most-active list with a
1/2 point gain to 12 3/4, following a secondary offering of
2.45 million shares of its stock at 12 1/8.
   Acxiom fell for the second day, losing 2 to 18 after
dropping 2 1/4 Wednesday. Several analysts lowered their
first-quarter and full-year earnings estimates after talking
with management yesterday, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Octel Communications lost 7/8 to 23 1/4. Montgomery
Securities downgraded its investment rating on Octel to a
"hold" from "buy" and lowered its earnings estimate for the
company's 1991 fiscal year, according to DJPIR.
