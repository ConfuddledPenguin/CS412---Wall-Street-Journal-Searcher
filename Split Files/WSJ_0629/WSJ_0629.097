   Mobil Corp. said one of its affiliates completed
agreements to proceed with the $1 billion development of the
rich Oso field off Nigeria.
   The agreements, with the Nigerian government and Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., allow Mobil to begin one of the
biggest petroleum developments ever in that West African
country.

   The project is expected to yield about 100,000 barrels of
condensate a day soon after production begins in early 1993.
The oil company and the country, a member of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, have both been careful to
point out that the crude-like hydrocarbons are condensate
rather than oil. That means the production won't be counted
as part of Nigeria's OPEC quota.
   A Mobil spokesman called the Oso condensate "a good
hydrocarbon that refines easily into light products,
including gasoline." Such condensates and light crudes tend
to carry a premium on world energy markets.
   The Oso field has nearly 500 million barrels of reserves,
Mobil estimated. Mobil Producing Nigeria, the company
affiliate, owns 40% of the field and is its operator.
Nigerian National Petroleum owns the other 60%.
   The Oso field development calls for construction of eight
offshore platforms, a condensate pipeline and storage tanks
and other facilities. Mobil, a New York-based oil and energy
concern, said a $400 million construction contract for the
project was awarded to an international consortium of
companies including McDermott International Inc. of New
Orleans.
   A McDermott spokesman confirmed the contract and said the
company, which specializes in offshore energy construction
projects, was named to do "a little over half" of the
construction work, which will also include a natural
gas-gathering system. Mobil Producing Nigeria plans to inject
natural gas from Oso and from other nearby fields that Mobil
operates into the Oso project to maintain reservoir pressure.
   Financing for the project came from the World Bank and
International Financial Corp., a World Bank affiliate.
Nigeria has had occasional difficulties funding its majority
interests in such programs, at times making payments with
crude oil instead of currency. But World Bank officials said
they were backing the Oso project because of its "enormous
potential." Industry estimates put annual revenue from the
project at $600 million.
   The Oso field is 35 miles offshore from the Qua Iboe
terminal that Mobil operates. The condensate pipeline will
link the two, and the condensate storage tanks will be at the
terminal.
