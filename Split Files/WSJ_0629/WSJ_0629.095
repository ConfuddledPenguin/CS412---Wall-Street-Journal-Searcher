   NEW YORK -- Reliance Capital Group L.P. continues to pump
money into Telemundo Group Inc., the unprofitable Spanish
language television network it controls.
   Reliance, Telemundo's principal shareholder, and Reliance
Insurance Co. agreed to invest $37.5 million in the
broadcaster. Both investors are affiliates of Saul P.
Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc.

   Reliance Capital will purchase two million shares from
Telemundo for $12.5 million; Reliance Insurance will purchase
four million shares for $25 million. The purchases will boost
ownership to about 43% for Reliance Capital and 35% for
Reliance Insurance of Telemundo's 36.9 million shares then
outstanding. The two companies own about 74% of the company.
   Telemundo will use the proceeds for working capital and
debt repayment.
   In the first quarter, Telemundo had a net loss of $14.7
million on $24.8 million of revenue, compared with a
year-earlier loss of $17.2 million on $22.5 million of
revenue. In 1989, the company had a net loss of $38.2 million
on revenue of $116.4 million.
   The two Reliance Group companies in December injected
about $42.5 million into the company through purchase of
about 8.1 million new shares.
   Despite the losses at Telemundo, a Reliance spokeswoman
said the network is "meeting management's expectations" with
revenue continuing to increase.
   In over-the-counter trading, Telemundo closed at $6.50 a
share, unchanged.
