   DALLAS -- Royal International Optical Corp., an
optical-stores retailer and frame maker, said U.S. Vision
Inc. completed its acquisition of the company and named the
surviving entity Royal International Optical Inc.
   U.S. Vision, an optical retailer based in Glendora, N.J.,
paid $12.50 a share for 80% of Royal's 7.1 million shares
outstanding and gave holders of the remainder a 25% stake in
the new company.

   William A. Schwartz, chairman and chief executive officer
of U.S. Vision, assumed identical posts at the new company.
Donald Gross, executive vice president of the former Royal,
was named president, the company said.
   Royal said it will operate 865 retail optical stores under
the names Royal and Wall &amp; Ochs and as a licensee of several
major department store chains.
   Mr. Schwartz said the new company, which will be traded on
the over-the-counter market under the symbol RIOC, will
divide its operations between New Jersey and Dallas. He said
the company, which he described as the U.S.'s largest
publicly held optical retailer, hasn't yet decided which city
will be its headquarters.
