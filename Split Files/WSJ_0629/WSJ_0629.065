   NEW YORK -- Bond investors, relieved that Wednesday's
Treasury note offering met brisk demand, bid prices higher.
The upbeat mood spilled over into the stock market.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose half a point, or
$5 for each $1,000 of face amount, in moderately active
trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.58 points
to 2878.71, but trading was light. The dollar rose against
the West German mark and fell against the yen.

   Analysts said Wednesday's offering of four-year Treasury
notes was so warmly received by investors because they think
action on cutting the U.S. budget deficit will bring interest
rates lower soon. On Tuesday, President Bush said the deficit
had to be cut, even if it meant raising taxes, thereby
clearing the way for potentially productive budget talks with
Congress.
   "It's a real watershed when the president and Congress can
get together on" deficit-cutting, said Peter Bass, head of
fixed-income trading for S.G. Warburg Securities.
   Buying enthusiasm continued yesterday and helped buoy the
30-year benchmark Treasury bond. Much of the early lift in
prices came from non-Japanese foreign investors, said Mr.
Bass.
   Stock prices also benefited from "window dressing" by some
money managers anxious to present good reports to clients.
"It's been a good quarter for the market," said Leo
Grohowski, head of equities trading at Marinvest, "and
portfolio managers don't want to show a lot of cash in their
end-of-the-quarter statements."
   Mr. Grohowski said another positive influence was Nike's
announcement that it would post sharply higher second-quarter
earnings -- a reassuring switch from the recent spate of
negative profit news.
   Much of what happened to the dollar was the result of
trading strategies that focused on other currencies, said
David Gilmore, senior foreign-exchange analyst at McCarthy,
Crisanti &amp; Maffei. For example, Japanese investors selling
sterling and buying yen hurt the dollar against the yen, Mr.
Gilmore said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on Big Board volume of 136.1 million
shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners, 911 to 559.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.44%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar ended mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6730 marks and 153.15 yen, compared
with 1.6645 marks and 154.45 yen Wednesday.
