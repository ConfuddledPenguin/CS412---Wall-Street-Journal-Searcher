   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., in an effort to raise cash and
reduce debt, said it filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of zero
coupon convertible senior debentures due 2005.
   The offering is expected to result in proceeds of about
$250 million, which will be used to reduce debt and for
general corporate purposes. The energy and steel giant has
about $5.9 billion in long-term debt outstanding. First
Boston Corp. is the sole manager of the offering.

any time on or before the maturity date into -- at the
company's option -- USX common stock or cash. The yield and
conversion rate haven't been determined.
   Holders have the right to sell debentures back to USX five
and 10 years after issuance for cash, shares of common stock,
or repayment notes, at USX's option. In addition, holders
have the right to sell debentures back to USX for cash in the
event of a change in the company's control.
