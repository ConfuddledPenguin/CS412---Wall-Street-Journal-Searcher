   Holnam Inc., a Dundee, Mich.-based unit of Holderbank
Financiere Glaris Ltd. of Switzerland, said it preliminarily
agreed to purchase the United Cement Co. subsidiary of Texas
Industries Inc., Dallas, for $61 million.
   United Cement consists of one cement plant in Mississippi
-- the only cement plant in the state -- and seven
distribution centers. Holnam, which makes cement and other
related products, said it expects to complete the purchase
later this summer. Holnam is the former Dundee Cement Co.,
which merged with Ideal Basic Industries in March, boosting
its annual sales to $1 billion.
