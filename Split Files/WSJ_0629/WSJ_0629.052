   TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses dropped
3.6% to 444,628 units in May from a year earlier, showing a
continuing decline because of the transfer of export-market
production to overseas plants.
   The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said U.S.
exports have declined because of the production transfer as
well as lower U.S. demand.

   Overall vehicle exports in May represent a 3.3% rise from
April, when exports posted an 18% year-to-year decline. An
association spokesman attributed these fluctuations to
shipping schedules.
   However, the U.S. remained the largest buyer of Japanese
vehicles in May, despite a 17% contraction in shipments.
Exports totaled 156,122 units.
   By vehicle types, passenger-car exports edged down to
337,551 units. Exports of medium-sized cars totaled 105,878
units, up 55%, while those of small cars dropped 14% to
231,673 units.
   Overall shipments of trucks declined 13% to 104,152 units.
Those of medium-sized trucks fell 6.6% to 77,645 units, and
of small trucks, 28% to 26,507 units.
   A total of 2,925 buses were exported in May, a 6.5% gain.
Shipments of large buses dropped 6.2% to 424, and shipments
of small buses rose 9% to 2,501.
   The gap between exports to the U.S. and to Europe, Japan's
second largest outlet, has narrowed recently. In May,
shipments to Europe increased 12% to 144,199 units.
   The European Community imported 109,143 Japanese vehicles,
up 14%, reflecting steady growth of shipments to West Germany
and the U.K.
   Shipments to the Middle East increased 48% to 20,405
units, pushed up largely by those to Saudi Arabia, which
imported 10,321 units, up 52%.
   According to the association's report, exports by the two
largest car makers in Japan declined from year-earlier
levels.
   Toyota Motor Corp. exports fell 3.6% to 147,377 units,
while those of Nissan Motor Co. dropped 6% to 67,344 units.
   Honda Motor Co. exported 49,584 units, down 2.7%.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. shipped 35,788 units, down 9.9%.
Mazda Motor Corp. posted a 3.6% gain to 59,041 units, and
Isuzu Motors Ltd. rose 7.8% to 24,261 units.
