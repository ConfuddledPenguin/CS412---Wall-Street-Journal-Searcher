   Aluminum and copper companies will post generally lower
earnings for the second consecutive quarter, as sluggish
automobile and construction sectors and increased metals
production pushed metals prices lower.
   Many gold producers' earnings were also depressed by lower
gold prices. Coal companies, however, appear to be in line
for higher earnings.

   Aluminum use for beverage and food cans rose 6.7% in the
first quarter and continued to rise in the second quarter,
and aircraft business continued strong, said Peter Anker, an
analyst at First Boston Corp. That helped offset slower
aluminum orders for automobile and construction, he said.
   But aluminum prices in the second quarter have averaged
about 70 cents a pound, a 36% drop from 95 cents a pound in
the second quarter a year ago. Although aluminum orders are
generally flat compared with the 1989 second quarter,
inventories are substantially greater than they were a year
ago, Mr. Anker said. He expects aluminum companies to report
that earnings dropped about 40% from the second quarter a
year ago.
   Some labor problems could develop over the next few months
that will decrease demand for aluminum by automobile makers,
while other potential labor disputes would reduce aluminum
production capacity, said Thomas VanLeeuwen of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. Contracts at one British Columbia smelter
expire at the end of July, and a couple of Washington state
smelters' contracts expire at the end of October. Meanwhile,
auto makers will negotiate new contracts in the fourth
quarter. "People are on pins and needles wondering if there
will be a fourth-quarter strike," Mr. VanLeeuwen said.
   He estimates Reynolds Metals Co. quarterly per-share
profit at $1.70 compared with $2.55 a year ago, Alcan
Aluminium Ltd. at 55 cents compared with $1.05, Aluminum Co.
of America at $1.90 to $2 compared with $3.21 and Amax Inc.
at 70 cents compared with $1.53.
   The average price of copper for the second quarter
declined 13.5% to $1.15 a pound from $1.33 a pound a year ago
as inventories rose. In the second quarter of 1989, many
copper makers canceled vacations to boost production while
prices were high and inventories tight. But this year, a
slowdown in automobile manufacturing and a drop in
construction spending, construction contracting and new home
sales moved supply and demand into balance, said John Gross,
publisher of the Copper Journal.
   Copper companies are expected to show generally lower
earnings for the quarter as a result. R. Wayne Atwell, an
analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., says he expects Asarco Inc.
to report earnings of $1.10 a share compared with $1.20 a
year ago, Cyprus Minerals Co. to show 85 cents compared with
$1.48, Phelps Dodge Corp. to post $3.15 compared with $3.50
and Magma Copper to weigh in with 45 cents compared with 42
cents.
   Mr. Atwell says copper could drop to as low as $1 a pound
through the summer doldrums and bounce back some at the end
of the year. Labor negotiations continue at Asarco, but
Kennecott Copper and Phelps Dodge have both signed new labor
agreements during the quarter, easing any concerns about
shortages.
   Good weather was both a charm and a curse for coal
companies, said Marc Cohen, an analyst at Kidder Peabody.
Mining conditions were aided by a quick end to winter and
little flooding in mining country. But the pleasant spring
also cut down on electric utilities' need for coal, he said.
   A sluggish U.S. economy weakened domestic spot coal
prices. But prices of metallurgical coal for export
increased. Altogether, "the positives more than offset the
negatives" for coal company earnings, Mr. Cohen said. Most
companies will show a slight increase in earnings over the
quarter a year ago.
   Pittston Co.'s unionized coal group has been profitable in
the second quarter, and its non-union mines "made lots of
money," Mr. Cohen said, indicating that the company has seen
the last of the earnings impacts from last year's bitter
strike. He projects the company will report earnings of 25
cents a share for the second quarter compared with a
strike-induced loss from a year ago.
   Another sign that things are improving for coal companies
was a decision in May by Westmoreland Coal Co. to declare a
quarterly dividend for the first time in two years. The
company said its program of reducing costs and closing
marginal operations improved the long-term outlook for
earnings. For 1989, earnings jumped to $11.5 million from
$1.5 million the year before. Mr. Cohen estimates the company
will earn about 35 cents a share for the second quarter after
seeing a loss a year ago.
   By late in the second quarter, gold prices had dropped
about $28 an ounce from the previous year's levels,
portending considerably lower earnings for gold companies.
Some companies have increased production, partially
offsetting the decline in price.
