   Apple Computer Inc. decided to fold its Claris software
unit -- which has spent most of this year laying plans for an
initial public offering -- back into the company.
   The move is a major switch for Apple, which formed Claris
three years ago to take over much of its personal-computer
software business. At the time, John Sculley, Apple's chief
executive officer, explained that Apple needed to distance
itself from the business of selling software applications so
as not to anger independent companies in that business. Ever
since, Mr. Sculley has cited Claris as an example of what he
describes as a "federation" of companies all supporting the
Apple "mothership."

   According to industry executives familiar with the
situation, Apple changed its mind because it believes it
needs more control over software applications for its
computers at a time when some of the most creative
independent software companies are beginning to spend more
resources on producing applications for competitors'
computers.
   Spokesmen for both Apple and Claris declined to comment,
but industry executives said Apple was ready to announce the
move as early as today.
   "It's a very sensible decision in my opinion," said
Charles Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Corp. "The entire
premise for setting up Claris no longer holds."
   Mr. Wolf said that unlike several years ago, when Apple's
flagship Macintosh computer had an insufficient amount of
software, there is plenty available for the machine today.
Apple now faces a situation where the outside firms that
write software for the Macintosh have been so successful that
they have begun writing software for machines based on
arch-rival International Business Machines Corp.'s personal
computers.
   Indeed, even executives at Claris conceded that once the
firm was independent from Apple, which was scheduled to
happen later this year, it too would begin writing software
for personal computers made by Apple competitors. While
Claris has posted yearly revenue about $100 million from
selling software from Apple computers, investment bankers,
handling the subsidiary's stock offering, insisted that
Claris broaden its business to flourish outside of Apple's
umbrella.
   According to people familiar with the situation, Michael
Spindler, who was named Apple's chief operating officer in
January, would not brook such a situation. He is said to
believe that Apple must have some internal capacity to
produce applications software that takes advantage of what
the company considers the unique features of its Macintosh
computers.
   Bringing Claris, which is the second biggest supplier of
Apple software after Microsoft Corp., back into Apple could
upset some independent software developers who are wary about
competing directly with Apple in software applications. But
the benefits of an internal applications business are worth
the criticisms.
   "Now Apple has a currency to retain the unique software on
the Macintosh," Mr. Wolf said.
   The flip-flop on the status of Claris is only one of many
organizational and strategic changes occurring at the
Cupertino, Calif., computer maker. This week, the company
hired a new president of Apple USA, its biggest sales and
marketing organization and yesterday it announced the
departure of one of its most senior executives in product
development.
   Donald P. Casey, Apple's vice president of networking and
engineering, joined Lotus Development Corp., a Boston-based
software company, as its new vice president of the
spreadsheet division, in charge of its key revenue source.
   Mr. Casey, 44 years old, said that the Lotus job "is a
great opportunity." He said he wasn't leaving Apple in a
dispute over strategy, but declined to comment on Apple's
outlook.
   Most of the changes are related to decisions made by Mr.
Spindler, who ran Apple's fast-growing European operations
before coming to headquarters to revive the company's
domestic marketing and streamline its field organization.
   On the product side, meanwhile, Apple also has made an
about-face. In recent years the company has introduced a
series of increasingly expensive computers. While successful,
these products have sharply narrowed the market for Apple's
machines, leading analysts to complain that the company is no
longer catering to the mass market.
   Mr. Sculley has made it plain that he intends to fix that
and since taking over direct responsibility for Apple's
product development in late January has been spending most of
his time trying to rush into creation two lower-priced
Macintosh machines.
   While outsiders question the wisdom of Mr. Sculley's
direct involvement in product planning -- the Apple chief is
a marketing man and has no formal training in engineering --
executives inside Apple's product development groups say he
is getting results.
   "Apple's playing a different game now, and frankly, that's
very refreshing," said Lawrence Tesler, vice president for
advanced products at Apple. Mr. Tesler approves of Mr.
Sculley's emphasis on less-expensive models because he
believes it will result in a broader following among computer
users.
