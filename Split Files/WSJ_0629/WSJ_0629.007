   Pathe Communications Corp.'s proposed $1.31 billion
acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co. appeared in jeopardy
as Pathe said discussions on a $650 million financing
arrangement with Time Warner Inc. had "reached an impasse."
   Los Angeles-based Pathe said, without providing details,
it "will seek alternative sources of financing to conclude
its acquisition of MGM/UA." It also said it would "continue a
dialogue with Time Warner" about the agreement that Time
Warner and Pathe signed in April.

   Time Warner executives, who had agreed to provide or
guarantee about half the financing for the deal in exchange
for coveted distribution rights and a security lien on the
United Artists film library, expressed surprise at the
announcement and had no immediate comment.
   Wall Street analysts have said Time Warner's participation
is the single most credible part of Pathe principal Giancarlo
Parretti's bid for MGM/UA.
   In Culver City, Calif., MGM/UA officials were understood
to believe that the deal will go through, with or without New
York-based Time Warner. "I don't know of anyone who would put
up that kind of money if they didn't believe the deal would
get done," one MGM/UA insider said, referring to the $200
million in earnest money that Pathe deposited into an escrow
account and stands to lose if the deal falls apart.
   But analysts contend Mr. Parretti's MGM/UA bid is all but
dead, marking the latest in a series of disappointments for
financier Kirk Kerkorian, who holds about an 82% stake in the
entertainment concern.
   "The chances of Kerkorian doing a deal with Pathe are
somewhere between zero and 0.0001 now," said David Londoner,
an entertainment analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. Jeffrey
Logsdon, an analyst at Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. said it was
unlikely that another financial backer would be found to
replace Time Warner. "This deal in every form and concoction
has already been shopped everywhere."
   The analysts speculated that Time Warner was scared off by
concerns that it might be accused of obtaining the United
Artists film library through "fraudulent conveyance" if a
debt-heavy Pathe were to default on its credit obligations.
Under that scenario, a court might invalidate Time Warner's
lien on the library and award those assets to all of the
creditors.
   "Without the library as collateral, Time Warner would
become just another lender," Mr. Londoner said. "That
obviously would be taking too big a risk." Other potential
financing sources probably would shy away for the same
reason.
   In recent weeks, Pathe has been trying to persuade Time
Warner to ease the terms of their agreement that require
Pathe to come up with $650 million in equity, including $450
million from its own sources rather than borrowed money.
Pathe officials contended they had met the spirit of the
agreement because much of their borrowing carried an option
letting the sum be paid back in the form of an equity stake
in Pathe.
   But Time Warner executives, led by Warner Brothers
Chairman Bob Daly and the studio's president, Terry Semel,
rejected the Pathe interpretation. Time Warner, burdened by
its own $10.6 billion debt, wasn't prepared to supply any
additional equity or other funds itself. Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., citing the huge Time Warner debt load, put the company
on its CreditWatch list recently because of the risks of
bankrolling the Pathe deal.
   Separately, Pathe and MGM/UA said they signed a merger
agreement for Pathe to acquire the movie studio upon terms
that were revised last week. As expected, Pathe also
terminated its $20-a-share tender offer for all 61 million
shares of MGM/UA because the new agreement structures Pathe's
acquisition as a merger rather than as a tender offer.
   Under terms of the new agreement, holders of MGM/UA common
and preferred would receive a total of $21.50 a share, of
which $4 a share would be paid July 20. Closing of the
transaction and payment of the remaining $17.50 a share is
expected on or before Oct. 23.
   Pathe said the $4-a-share payment would be funded from the
$200 million escrow account. An additional $53 million needed
to make the distribution is due July 16. Pathe is also
required to deposit into the account an additional $100
million in two installments of $50 million each on Aug. 21
and Sept. 20.
