   ROME -- Italy's foreign trade account deficit widened to a
provisional, unadjusted 2.495 trillion lire ($2.05 billion)
in May from 2.139 trillion lire a year earlier and from 877
billion lire in April, the state statistical office Istat
said.
   Istat also said the trade balance in this year's first
five months showed a deficit of 12.506 trillion lire,
slightly narrower than 13.501 trillion lire a year earlier.

   The lira value of imports in May rose 5% to 19.805
trillion lire from a year earlier, and exports rose 3.5% to
17.31 trillion lire. In the first five months, imports rose
5.6% to 93.651 trillion lire, and exports grew 7.9% to 81.145

   Import value is calculated on a cost, insurance and
freight basis, and exports are accounted for on a
free-on-board basis.
