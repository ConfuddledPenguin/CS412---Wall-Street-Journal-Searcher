   TSB Group PLC, one of Britain's biggest banks, reported
pretax profit for the six months ended April 30 rose 6.7% to
#175 million ($305.2 million) from #164 million a year
earlier, as firm returns from retail banking and financial
services offset depressed returns in corporate banking.
   Per-share earnings fell 2.7% to 7.2 pence from 7.4 pence.

   The fiscal first-half pretax results were weaker than most
market forecasts but a modest improvement from a year
earlier, when TSB's pretax profit slid 22%. TSB, which also
moved late last year to curb operating costs, doesn't
disclose results by unit or specify loan-loss provisions. But
it said pretax profit was held back by increased
mortgage-exposure provisions of its retail banking division
and advances by its corporate banking division to the
property, construction and retailing sectors.
   Retail banking, the largest contributor to TSB profit,
rose to #117 million from #89.1 million, though TSB said the
year-earlier figure isn't directly comparable, citing the
continuing restructuring.
