   Avon Products Inc., New York, said a U.S. appeals court
upheld a judge's ruling that invalidated an amendment to its
"poison pill" shareholder rights plan.
   The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed federal Judge
Pierre Leval's ruling in April that Avon couldn't lower the
so-called trigger level for the poison pill. Currently, if
any buyer acquires more than 20% of the cosmetics company's
shares outstanding, other holders would receive the right to
buy another share at half-price for each share held.

   Avon had sought to amend the rights plan by reducing the
trigger level to 12.5%, in an effort to prevent Chartwell
Associates L.P., the biggest Avon holder, from acquiring more
stock at market prices without bidding for the entire company
at an expected premium. Chartwell, which challenged the
amendment, held 12.4% of Avon's shares at the time.
   Avon said in a statement that all other aspects of its
shareholder rights plan remain in effect. Avon shares rose $1
yesterday to close at $36.25 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
