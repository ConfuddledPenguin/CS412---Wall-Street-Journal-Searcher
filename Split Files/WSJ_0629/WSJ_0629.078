   Given your ideological bias, it's only natural your
editorial focused on the wrong blank check in assessing blame
for the S&amp;L mess ("History of a Blank Check," May 24).
Contrary to your editorial, deposit insurance is not the
major culprit.
   The blank check was the Reagan administration's
well-documented disdain for adequate supervision and
regulation of the savings-and-loan industry in the early
1980s. The blank check was product and services deregulation
that outran supervisory capacity, and the failure of the
Reagan administration and Congress to limit the flow of
brokered deposits to crooked and brain-dead S&amp;Ls. Yes,
increasing deposit-insurance coverage to $100,000 upped the
amounts that could be brokered, but this was controllable.
The administration and Congress just chose not to control it,
since deregulation and desupervision were in -- let the free
market roll.

   Your solution to the problems confronting the S&amp;L industry
and banking is to cut back existing levels of deposit
insurance. This will only further undermine consumer
confidence in our increasingly fragile financial system and
weaken further our economic and financial system. It would
weaken healthy S&amp;Ls by driving out their depositors, which
would further escalate costs to the taxpayer. And in terms of
international competitiveness, American banks have to offer
the same product offered by their major Japanese and European
competitors. And as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman
William Seidman recently testified, what our foreign
competitors offer is that no depositor in a major bank
anywhere in the world has lost a penny since the end of World
War II. Banks are special and they always should be -- their
coin is other people's money.

   Bravo] Better late than never.
   You correctly fix the blame for the S&amp;L mess on
deregulating the thrift industry immediately after raising
the deposit insurance to $100,000 per account, for no
apparent reason. Thus the Reagan administration set the stage
for the biggest financial scandal the world has ever seen,
beginning in 1980.
   I applaud you for your mea culpa, acknowledging somewhat
sheepishly, "we ourselves missed the importance of the
$100,000 figure, but by the time of the 1982 bill warned, `As
things stand now, deregulation under guaranteed banking will
give banks a competitive edge in attracting funds from the
public while compounding the opportunity for bank managements
to behave imprudently.'"
   Smart people at the FDIC and in Congress have known for a
long time that the current 100% insurance per deposit invites
disaster. You mention two of the most obvious cures: insuring
only 85% of the insurable limit, or whacking the limit of
insurance in half. I would prefer both.
   A scream would go up that this would discriminate against
$100,000 depositors who had put their money in relying on the
full faith and credit of the federal patsies. There is a
simple way to keep faith with them and still put in place a
system that will make sure it doesn't happen again: Keep the
current deposits insured as they now are, but put the new,
more prudent system in place for all future deposits. After
the law is passed, of course.
   I suppose there would be a flight to quality by
depositors, but in the long run that would go a very long way
to make sure it never happens again.
