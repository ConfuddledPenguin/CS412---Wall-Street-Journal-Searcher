   NEW YORK -- Because of Wall Street's continuing slump, far
fewer traders and investment bankers are lining up to buy
high-powered, high-priced cars such as Porsches and BMWs.
   But in the rest of the U.S. -- and in Japan and Europe --
sales of these performance cars are shifting into overdrive.
Several European auto analysts say shares of Porsche and
Bayerische Motoren Werke are underpriced, even if Americans
have to search a bit to find ways to buy those stocks.

   Porsche, which is much smaller than BMW and makes more
expensive cars, gets more enthusiastic reviews for its adroit
recovery from a sales slump in 1987. Porsche shares trade at
a price-earnings ratio of about 17.5, close to that of
Daimler Benz, the giant of German auto makers. Several
analysts believe Porsche will someday command a higher
multiple, however, because it's the only remaining publicly
traded specialty car maker.
   "We really do believe Porsche is the last of its kind
remaining in the world" after Ford Motor's purchase of
Britain's Jaguar, says Stephen M. Reitman, a London-based
analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
   Though Mr. Reitman and other analysts also recommend BMW,
which trades at a significantly lower price-earnings ratio
than Porsche and Daimler Benz, they fear that BMW shares may
get stuck in neutral because of fears about increasing
Japanese competition in the lower end of the luxury-car
market.
   "I think BMW is cheap and that one should probably buy
it," says Philip Ayton, a London-based analyst with Barclays
de Zoete Wedd. But he adds that BMW's stock "has performed
badly and I'm not sure even now whether there's going to be a
change in sentiment."
   Several analysts cite Porsche's swift recovery from the
gear-grinding changes of 1987 as evidence of a management
that recognized the company's problems and acted decisively.
   Through 1986, Porsche rode the big luxury-car boom in the
U.S. and allowed U.S. sales to claim 70% of its peak
production of about 53,500 cars a year. Porsche "stepped
right into the dollar trap by getting a little too greedy and
selling too many cars in the States," says Dagmar
Bottenbruch, a European auto analyst for Credit Suisse First
Boston. "Then the currency halved and the bottom fell out of
the luxury-car market" in the U.S., she adds.
   But now, Ms. Bottenbruch says, Porsche "has its destiny
under control." Production has been cut to about 31,000 cars
a year. U.S. sales now represent only about one-third of
Porsche's total, with an equal amount in Germany and the rest
concentrated in other European countries and Japan.
   Porsche also eliminated its cheapest and least profitable
model in the U.S., the 924, which had been priced at about
$24,000, Mr. Reitman says. Now, the lowest-price Porsche sold
in the U.S. is the 944, at $43,350.
   The most profitable models for Porsche are the various
versions of its classic 911, descendants of the original
Porsche which resembled an upside-down bathtub.
   Porsche sales in the U.S. and Japan have been rising this
year, up 19% in the U.S. through May and up 62% in Japan
through April. But Mr. Reitman doesn't expect big increases
in either production or prices. Porsche "trades on having a
cache, on their rarity and desirability. They will accept
waiting lists," he believes.
   One slightly hidden asset, Mr. Reitman says, is Porsche's
research and development facility in Weissach, West Germany,
which does work for many other auto makers, including Ford,
and is run as a profit center. During the 1987-88 period the
center took on additional work that should produce more
profits in the next few years, he says.
   Porsche also has net cash of 459 million marks ($275.8
million) and no debt; analysts expect the company to be able
to continue to fund its development from cash flow.
   Porsche's fiscal year ends July 31; Mr. Reitman expects
the company to report a profit of about 70 marks ($42) a
share; Ms. Bottenbruch expects profit of 72 to 75 marks a
share. For next year, Mr. Reitman forecasts 80 marks a share
but says that could be low; Ms. Bottenbruch looks for 85
marks to 90 marks a share.
   At yesterday's closing price of 1232 marks, Porsche is
trading at about 17.5 times its expected 1990 earnings. The
Porsche shares that trade on the Frankfurt exchange are
non-voting preference shares; voting control is held by
members of the Porsche and Piech families.
   BMW, which closed yesterday at 584.50 marks, trades at
only about 10 times analysts' estimates of its 1990 earnings;
Daimler Benz is trading at about 17 times estimated 1990
earnings. That price/earnings gap, asserts Mr. Reitman, is
"totally unjustified."
   BMW can be bought in the U.S. as an American Depositary
Receipt; Porsche stock trades only in German markets.
   BMW shares have sagged on fears that new Japanese-made
luxury cars, such as Infiniti and Lexus, will steal some
market share from BMW, whose lowest priced 318is model has a
U.S. base price of $21,500. Mr. Ayton concedes that the
Japanese will grab some part of the luxury market, but says:
"I'm not convinced that it will be fully at BMW's expense or
at the expense of BMW's margins."
   There's some concern that BMW's profit may ebb next year
as it revises the models in its best-selling 3-series. Ms.
Bottenbruch, who has a neutral rating on BMW, says the shares
may get a boost once the new models are introduced. "The car
press already says this is going to be a real blockbuster,"
she notes.
   One additional issue for U.S. investors in either Porsche
or BMW is how the mark fares against the dollar. A falling
mark would diminish potential capital gains. Though many
economists expect the mark to thrive against the dollar
long-term, there is some concern that the mark will weaken
during the next few months because of the costs of German
reunification.
