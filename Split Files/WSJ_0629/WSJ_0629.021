   Remember the glut of science magazines that hit the
newsstands in the 1970s only to vanish or metamorphose into
something else? Backers of a new crop of environmental
periodicals hope to escape the same fate.
   Carrying intriguing titles such as Buzzworm, Garbage and
E, the new environmental magazines have been bankrolled by
entrepreneurs and nonprofit groups. Now flourishing in the
afterglow of Earth Day this spring, the magazines' backers
are betting that there is a long-term appetite in American
households for more articles on ozone depletion, recycled
diapers and pest-free gardening.

   For the moment, their optimism looks well-placed. For the
maiden issue of Garbage last fall, Editor and Publisher
Patricia Poore planned to print 50,000 copies and figured
"we'd have to give some of these away." But interest rose and
the first press run hit 126,000 copies. After five issues,
Ms. Poore says she has 110,000 subscribers for her
irreverently named bimonthly, based in Brooklyn, N.Y.
   Doug Moss, editor and publisher of E, a bimonthly
published in Norwalk, Conn., says his inaugural issue got a
boost when two members of Congress from Connecticut sent
copies with a personal note to all their congressional
colleagues. Mr. Moss says his fifth issue is nearing deadline
and adds, "We've got advertisers we're turning away."
   Subscriptions to Buzzworm, a Boulder, Colo., bimonthly
that uses striking color photography to illustrate global
environmental issues, have topped 50,000, according to
managing editor Elizabeth Darby Junkin. She says the
magazine's start-up is being financed "the old-fashioned way.
. . . We found some people with money."
   The initial signs of success these magazines enjoy
underscore the boost a new venture can get riding a major
social trend. But publishing veterans say a flurry of early
interest is no guarantee of long-term victory in the fiercely
competitive world of magazines. Like small businesses
generally, more magazines fail in the early years than
succeed.
   "The lesson with all these fringe magazines is that people
perceive a big interest from readers and rush in," says Ron
Javers, editor of Philadelphia magazine. "But you also need
advertiser interest in those readers. If you don't have both,
you're out in the cold."
   Making matters worse for fledgling publishers, advertisers
have been unusually stingy with their magazine budgets,
negotiating for lower rates or cutting ads altogether. On top
of this, new nature-oriented publications face added
competition from established magazines published by
environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and the National
Audubon Society.
   "A number of well written, extremely handsome magazines
have already staked out this territory," says Thomas Rawls,
editor of Country Life magazine.
   Publishers of the three new magazines remain upbeat. Ms.
Poore is running Garbage in the image of her 16-year-old
magazine, Old House Journal, a publication about restoring
old houses that has a circulation of 190,000. She carefully
targets potential readers by direct mail and prices
subscriptions relatively high, (Garbage is $21 for six
issues), so that circulation revenue carries about 70% of
total costs. "The magazine grows slowly but it's a little
more inflation proof," she says.
   The magazine's offbeat title is designed to be both blunt
and humorous. "We're about day-to-day life, not your
wilderness vacation," Ms. Poore says. Garbage's stories deal
with such gritty issues as packaging, composting and
breakthroughs in toilet design.
   "Buzzworm is into conservation beauty while we're sort of
the dishpan hands of the movement," Ms. Poore says.
   Like Garbage, Buzzworm's odd title was designed to be
catchy and easy to remember. It's slang in the Southwest for
rattlesnake. "It's awkward on the East Coast, we realize
that," says Ms. Junkin, the managing editor. "As we get
older, if we have to do a title change, we'll look at it."
   Founded in mid-1988 by photojournalist Joseph Daniel,
Buzzworm uses striking photographs to illustrate
environmental stories from around the world. The latest issue
includes photo essays on residents of the Amazon rain forest,
the elusive Indian tiger and coral reef diving off the
Mexican coast.
   "We include adventure travel; we don't forget that we're
here to entertain," says Ms. Junkin. "A magazine that thinks
it can preach all the time is not going to work."
   Preaching is E's forte. "We're following major social
issues, not just how to recycle your cups at home," says Mr.
Moss, the editor and publisher. "My job . . . is to make
waves and rock the boat."
   Grants from several nonprofit foundations and a $50,000
interest-free loan from the Humane Society of the U.S. helped
launch the magazine. Mr. Moss's own business forms company
subsidized staff salaries in the early going.
   Ads are a prickly issue for environmental publications. Ad
revenue may keep the magazine afloat, but readers may view it
as a publisher's sellout.
   At E, Mr. Moss's foundation financing frees him to be
choosy about ads. He says, for example, that E wouldn't run
an automobile or truck ad because gas-powered vehicles are
polluters. "Companies that say `Rah, rah, rah, we're
environmentalists, too,'" he says. "That's not what we're
about."
   Buzzworm takes a different tack. "If the profit motive
gets a multinational corporation to become more
environmentally conscious, there's nothing wrong with that,"
says Ms. Junkin. "We're happy to say that Nike, Esprit and
Sears came to us."
   E is increasing its size to 84 pages so that it can sell
more space, but Mr. Moss says he won't go over a self-imposed
ceiling of devoting no more than 40% of the magazine to ads.
"You can cross the line where you look too commercial," he
says.
   Though Mr. Moss thinks E will be a survivor, he assumes
some environmental magazines will sink. But he adds: "If we
can support swimsuit annuals and motorcycle magazines and all
that fluff, we can support three environmental magazines and
probably more."
