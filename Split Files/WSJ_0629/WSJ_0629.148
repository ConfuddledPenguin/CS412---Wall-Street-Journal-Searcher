   NEW YORK -- Backed by the successful completion of trade
negotiations between Japan and the U.S., the yen rose,
diverting the market's attention from German monetary union,
at least for a day.
   The across-the-board yen purchases depressed the dollar by
more than a yen on the day but lifted the U.S. currency
against its European counterparts.

   Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 153.15
yen, below 154.45 yen late Wednesday in New York. The U.S.
currency also was changing hands at 1.6730 marks, up from
1.6645 marks. Sterling was trading at $1.7381, down from
$1.7428.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at
153.08 yen; it closed Thursday in Tokyo at 154.42 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6738
marks, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6627 marks.
   On Thursday, foreign-exchange traders said that for the
first time in a long time, prices moved on fundamental rather
than technical factors. They said the outcome of the
U.S.-Japanese Structural Impediments Initiative talks will
probably mean the narrowing of the differential between
Japanese interest rates and the higher U.S. rates.
   To help trim its $49 billion trade surplus with the U.S.,
Japanese officials agreed to spend 430 trillion yen ($2.78
trillion) on public works projects over the next 10 years.
The U.S. had asked for such a commitment in hopes that it
would soak up some of the private savings that provide
Japanese companies with cheaper capital than their U.S.
competitors.
   The Japanese government's spending is expected to increase
price pressures, encouraging the Bank of Japan to head off
inflation by tightening credit. Earlier yesterday, the
central bank asked Japanese commercial banks to slow the
growth of their lending.
   U.S. interest rates, meanwhile, can only go down, said
Tomi Kilgore, assistant treasurer for Toyo Trust &amp; Banking
Co. in New York. The softening of President Bush's "no new
taxes" pledge was seen as opening the door for an easier U.S.
credit policy.
   A combined one-point swing in U.S. and Japanese interest
rates would push the yield advantage from dollar to yen
instruments, encouraging investors to purchase yen.
Currently, Eurodollar bonds pay 8 3/8%, compared with 7
11/16% for Euroyen debt securities.
   The prospect of higher Japanese interest rates also helped
the yen against European currencies. West German rates are
just about the same as U.S. rates, and Swiss rates are a
little higher. The yen scored fewer gains against high-yield
currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars and
the pound.
   Michael Rosenberg, an international foreign exchange
economist for Merrill Lynch, said implementing the trade
accord will push Japan into an economic policy similar to
that pursued by West Germany. An expansive fiscal policy
combined with a tight monetary policy is invariably bullish
for a nation's currency, he said.
   Conversely, the U.S. is "moving to more fiscal restraint,
and there is expectation of lower interest rates," Mr.
Rosenberg said.
   He cautioned that higher Japanese and German interest
rates, because of the fluidity of world debt markets, could
eventually force U.S. rates higher.
   Also moving the market was a dollar breakthrough against
the Swiss franc. According to Robert Ryan, foreign exchange
manager for Bank of New York, the dollar's move past 1.4140
Swiss francs around noon in New York "put a little bit of
squeeze" on people who had shorted, or oversold, dollars
against European currencies in recent days.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $352.10 an ounce, up 70 cents. Estimated
volume was a light 2.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at $351.65 an
ounce.
