   NEW YORK -- Despite scattered earnings disappointments,
such as the announcements earlier this week by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Caterpillar Inc., the overall
outlook for second-quarter profits holds more hope than
horror.
   AT&amp;T and Caterpillar shocked investors by disclosing that
earnings aren't meeting expectations. AT&amp;T said Wednesday
that its second-quarter profit probably will be below
year-earlier results, while Caterpillar said Monday that it
expects current-year earnings will be "substantially lower"
than last year's.

   But analysts and money managers say there is little
evidence of earnings problems at many other large companies.
Indeed, they are counting on seeing plenty of pleasant
surprises in coming weeks, as corporations report their
second-quarter results.
   This is good news for investors who have a broadly
diversified portfolio of stocks. The flood of second-quarter
earnings reports to be released in the next few weeks isn't
likely to wash the value of these investors' shares down the
drain.
   At the same time, however, investors who are heavily
committed to a single stock that dares to disappoint Wall
Street with worse-than-expected results had better brace
themselves. They're apt to get hammered.
   That's the lesson analysts and money managers find in the
seemingly paradoxical performance of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and AT&amp;T, a key component of the industrial average,
following Wednesday's announcement. That day, irritated
investors dumped AT&amp;T shares, driving the price down $2.125,
to $39.125, on volume of 11.5 million shares. AT&amp;T's normal
daily volume is 1.8 million shares. Yet even as AT&amp;T plunged
Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged up 19.80
points to close at 2862.13 in light trading. Yesterday,
turnover of more than 3.7 million shares of AT&amp;T made it the
most active Big Board issue for the second consecutive
session, and the shares lost 37.5 cents, to finish at $38.75,
as the industrial average rose 16.58 points to 2878.71.
   Investors also punished Caterpillar on Monday, driving the
price down $5 a share to $58.50 on the Big Board, following
the company's earnings announcement. On Tuesday, the slide
continued, as Caterpillar shares fell $6. Then the stock
stabilized, and closed yesterday at $52.375, up 12.5 cents.
   Not everyone believes that such incidents will be the
exception. Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Barclays
de Zoete Wedd, the securities unit of Barclays Bank, says all
the earnings optimism scares her.
   Through the first quarter, she says, earnings of the S&amp;P
500 stocks amounted to $21.67 a share. For all of 1990, she
estimates earnings of the group at $22 a share, down from
$22.88 last year. "What that means is that sometime beginning
right about now and accelerating through the fall, there's
going to be an overwhelming number of earnings-estimate
revisions on the downside."
   But Ms. Cohen is clearly in the minority. The consensus
expectation among analysts calls for a 10% gain in per-share
earnings for the S&amp;P 500 to about $25.25, says Benjamin
Zacks, executive vice president of Chicago-based Zacks
Investment Research. He calls negative surprises such as AT&amp;T
and Caterpillar "isolated hand grenades."
   And John Bogle, a portfolio manager at Boston-based State
Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., contends, "We haven't seen any
dramatic shift across the entire universe" of about 1,100
stocks that the firm follows.
   At Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan, a brokerage firm for institutions
that tracks analysts' expectations, Richard Pucci says
estimates for 1990 S&amp;P-500 earnings "bottomed out" earlier
this year. May and June have seen rises in estimates to about
$27.10 a share. "The momentum is toward improved earnings,"
he argues.
   What makes negative earnings surprises so troubling is
that they are usually announced before companies with good
news start making headlines, says Michael Sherman, chief
investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "Between
now and the beginning of July," he predicts, "we'll see a
number of companies going to the confessional," as they find
that the second quarter wasn't as good as they had expected.
   Then, all the companies that discovered the second quarter
was as good as, if not better than, they had expected will
begin releasing their reports, and investors will get "some
very pleasant surprises," he says. He is especially counting
on healthcare, food and technology companies to bring home
the bacon for shareholders.
   Even if investors are disappointed by a company's results,
Mr. Sherman says it is a mistake to sell in a knee-jerk
reaction. "I'm frankly amazed people can sell Telephone
{AT&amp;T} on a bad quarter when the company says it can make it
up the rest of the year," he says.
   And while investors' ire about Caterpillar is easier to
understand -- investors are running out of patience with the
company's long-term turnaround strategy -- reacting too
quickly can be a mistake. "You might decide, based on the
latest news, whether you want to be in it six months from
now, but you wouldn't want to sell on the news," Mr. Sherman
counsels.
