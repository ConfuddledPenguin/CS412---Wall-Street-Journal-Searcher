   New York -- The struggle for the survival of the National
Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is a story without heroes. Its
adversaries in Congress have grossly distorted or
misrepresented its accomplishments, while several Christian
leaders, in attempting to destroy the NEA, have adopted
decidedly un-Christian tactics. Meanwhile, those on the side
of the arts, presumably creative, expressive individuals,
have been sadly inarticulate and disorganized.
   The endowment is a remarkable, in fact, a unique federal
agency. When it was created 25 years ago, the government made
a de facto proclamation that the arts are important to our
nation. In the same way that we maintain a Defense Department
to protect our lives and our land and we have a National
Parks Service to protect the beauty of our plains and
forests, so we have an NEA to safeguard an important part of
our spiritual life: to preserve great art from the past and
to ensure free artistic expression in the future.

   The period of the NEA has been an astonishing time of
growth for the arts in this country: In 1965 there were about
60 professional orchestras in this country; today there are
three times that many. The growth in theater and dance
companies has been even more dramatic. Audiences have
increased as well. The estimates are that dance audiences
have gone from one million to 16 million in that 25-year
period. The growth has been not only in quantity but in
quality, with far more first-rate museums and performing-arts
organizations now than before.
   On the money side, one of the NEA's most extraordinary
accomplishments has been the leveraging of its funds, a feat
that should be dear to the heart of any free-enterprise
entrepreneur. Virtually every institutional grant of the NEA
is a matching grant, requiring funds from the private sector,
usually on at least a 3-to-1 basis. In the past decade, $237
million in NEA challenge grants have been matched by more
than $2 billion in new or increased contributions from
private sources. The cost to taxpayers for all of this is 64
cents per person per year.
   When it was discovered last year that a few photographs in
two exhibits were offensive to many individuals, the
opponents of the NEA entered the battle in full cry. Ignoring
Lithuania abroad, the homeless at home, and the S&amp;L debacle
(which will cost every man, woman and child in the U.S. more
than $2,000 before it is over), irate congressional and
Christian leaders aimed their blunderbusses at the tiny mouse
of the NEA. The Rev. Donald Wildmon of Mississippi, head of
the American Family Association, mounted a campaign of
disinformation, not only brandishing photographs out of
context from exhibitions and museum catalogs but reprinting
only portions of them. (In a suit for libel and copyright
infringement brought by artist David Wojnarowicz, a federal
judge recently issued a temporary injunction stopping further
publication of a Wildmon pamphlet.) Pat Robertson in a recent
full-page ad in a Washington newspaper asked members of
Congress: "Do you want to face the voters in your district
with the charge that you are wasting their hard-earned money
to promote sodomy, child pornography and attacks on Jesus
Christ?" Looking beyond the ugly threat in the ad, one is
prompted to ask: What hard-earned money? A small fraction of
64 cents? Come on.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher of California set their congressional staffs
to work (spending thousands and thousands of taxpayers'
dollars) to comb the 84,000 grants the NEA has made over its
25-year history to find offensive material. After months of
searching, the staffs are likely to come up with less than
one-tenth of one percent that offends their notion of
community standards.
   On the other side, the arts community had its own
problems; in fact, it has been in almost complete disarray.
When Mr. Wildmon and Mr. Robertson mounted enormous
letter-writing drives to members of Congress, it took arts
organizations months to respond. Just when arts groups began
to get their act together several state arts agencies put
forth a plan to divert funds from the NEA to the states. The
plan, which was out-and-out fratricide, would have meant the
end of the NEA and subsequently was withdrawn.
   John Frohnmayer took over as head of the NEA just when the
storm broke. Caught in the crossfire, he didn't know quite
where to turn. In the meantime, he was getting no help from
the White House, which has sent mixed signals, when it has
sent any at all. Timidly supporting the notion of
reauthorization of the NEA for five years, the White House
later supported a one-year extension, but that was
immediately shot down by congressional leaders.
   One of the great misfortunes of this brouhaha has been
that it has diverted attention from what should have been a
serious debate about the mission of the NEA. After 25 years,
this was the ideal time to review its goals and its means of
achieving them. In fact, a commission headed by John Brademas
and Leonard Garment has been appointed to do just that.
   A number of issues surrounding the NEA need to be
addressed. How best can grants to artists be made -- not in
terms of censorship, but to assure that the most promising as
well as the most talented are supported? There also is the
question of how much NEA support should go to established
arts organizations, "national treasures" such as our great
museums, symphonies, opera and theater companies -- and how
much to individual artists. These are valid issues and should
be the subject of vigorous, informed debate.
   On the other hand, debating whether we should have an NEA
at all, or whether it should attempt to control content is a
wrong-headed exercise in demagoguery that ultimately benefits
no one, least of all conservatives. They have better things
to do with their energies, some of which might be spent
visiting museums, galleries and theaters in order to get a
more balanced sense of the vigorous world of the arts in this
country today. Quite a lot of that vigor flows directly from
the admirable performance of the NEA over the last quarter
century.
