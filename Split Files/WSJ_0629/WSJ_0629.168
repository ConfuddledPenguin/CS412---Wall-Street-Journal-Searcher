   Cumberland Federal Bancorp. said it will take an $8
million pretax charge in the second quarter to boost its
loan-loss reserve.
   The Louisville, Ky., savings bank said the move reflects
"uncertainties about the value of various projects and
loans." The company said it believes its reserves after the
charge will be adequate to address known and potential loan
losses.

   The company said after the charge it will have in excess
of $60 million in capital, a book value of approximately $24
a share and will remain in compliance with all regulatory
capital requirements.
   Cumberland also said it expects to report net earnings for
1990. In the year-ago second quarter, Cumberland earned $1.7
million, or 70 cents a share. In 1989, it earned $5 million,
or $2.02 a share.
