   BANGKOK -- Thai authorities' about-face on a proposed
joint-venture glass factory has removed an irritant in
U.S.-Thai economic relations.
   The Board of Investment this week cleared Siam Cement Co.
and Guardian Industries Corp. of Northville, Mich., to set up
a three billion baht ($116.6 million) float-glass factory to
supply Thailand's booming construction industry. Float glass
is a superior form of plate glass.

   The move effectively ended a longstanding near-monopoly on
plate-glass production by Thai-Asahi Glass, which has close
links to Chat Thai, the dominant party in Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan's coalition government. It also marked a
triumph for Guardian. Unlike Japanese and Taiwanese
companies, which dominate foreign investment in Thailand, "a
lot of American companies get overwhelmed" by the intricacies
and obstacles in doing business in Thailand, a U.S.
businessman said, but "Guardian dug in . . . and overcame
those problems."
   The float-glass plant, to be 51%-owned by Siam Cement and
49% by Guardian, was proposed last year, but a five-year ban
on new glass factories was imposed last May. U.S. officials
pressured Thailand to remove the ban and allow U.S.
participation in the country's heavily protected glass
market.
   Some analysts believe Thai-Asahi's predominance in the
glass industry is aided by political connections. The
founder, Pramarn Adireksarn, is Chat Thai's advisory
chairman, the government's industry minister and the prime
minister's brother-in-law. He is no longer directly involved
with Thai-Asahi. The company's president, Kiarti
Srifeungfung, is a founding member of Chat Thai. Thai-Asahi,
60%-owned by Thai businessmen and 40% by the Asahi Group of
Japan, has annual capacity of about 219,000 tons of plate
glass; its affiliate, Siam Plate Glass Co., has 30,000 tons.
Shortly before the ban on additional glass output was
ordered, Thai-Asahi received government approval to set up a
131,000-ton-capacity factory, to be operated by Bangkok Float
Glass Co., which is being formed and will be about 60%-owned
by Thai-Asahi and its Thai partners, and about 40% by Asahi
Group.
   Thai-Asahi lobbied hard to block Guardian's joint venture.
It argued that demand wouldn't be sufficient to support
Guardian's production, and that the project would hurt all
Thai glass factories. Yet when the Board of Investment
approved Guardian's project, it sweetened terms for
Thai-Asahi's glass production, which will result in even
greater glass supplies for the Thai market. The board waived
its requirement that Thai-Asahi and Siam Plate Glass export
30% of their output, allowing them to sell all of it
domestically. And Bangkok Float Glass's export requirement
was cut from 80% to 50%, the same as for the Siam
Cement-Guardian plant.
