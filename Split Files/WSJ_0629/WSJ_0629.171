   FED EASING isn't likely, despite the plunge in gold
prices.
   Some private analysts argue that the Fed should ease money
policies at next week's meeting because a 20% drop in gold's
price since February means inflation fears are receding. But
Fed officials see other reasons for the fall: The Soviets
have been selling gold to help their lagging economy, and
Mideast traders have been dumping gold in anticipation of
further Soviet sales.

   Even the Fed's leading gold bug, Wayne Angell, has said
gold would have to drop below $350 an ounce before he'd get
concerned; it's currently floating just above that level.
Bush officials look to new Fed member David Mullins to lead
the way to lower interest rates. But he is said to be
concerned about establishing credibility at the Fed before
becoming active.
   The White House hopes its new tax stand, which raises
hopes for cutting the deficit, will encourage the Fed to
ease.
                                                                                                       

   FARM SUBSIDIES shape up as a divisive issue at the
economic summit.
   Officials of the seven nations that will meet in Houston
next month fail so far to forge a compromise framework for
settling disputes over agriculture. Without some movement, it
will be up to Bush and the other leaders to resolve the
impasse with the European Community. The issue threatens to
stymie the whole round of international trade liberalization
talks.
   The Europeans want to lump together different kinds of
support for agriculture, such as export and production
subsidies, and reduce that total. But the U.S. and Canada,
along with other food exporters, want to focus on specific
subsidies. Otherwise, they fear, the EC won't adequately
address its $9 billion a year in farm export subsidies.
                                                                                                       

   BUSH BACKS a major revamping of NATO, but resists some
changes.
   Alliance leaders will map strategy changes when they meet
in London next week. A key revision will be to reduce
frontline defenses in Germany and put the forces under
officers from several NATO countries. The challenge is "to be
sure NATO is seen by Western publics to adapt" to the changes
in Europe, one senior Bush aide says.
   The underlying political goal: to get Moscow to accept a
united Germany inside the Western alliance. But the U.S.
wants to put off discussion of withdrawing short-range
nuclear arms from Europe until next year's talks with the
Soviets. And Bush aides rule out declaring that the West
would never be first to use nuclear weapons.
   Britain and France fear that talk of "de-nuclearizing"
Germany would generate public pressure to dismantle their own
nuclear arsenals.
                                                                                                       

   NO NEW -- WHOOPS] Republicans are undercut by Bush's tax
turnabout. GOP Rep. Gingrich had just mailed a fund-raising
plea for the National Tax Limitation Committee attacking
pro-tax "liberal elites" and vowing "to fight them to the
finish on this make-or-break issue."
                                                                                                       

   GRUMBLING GROWS that former quarterback Kemp is becoming a
lonesome end. A message sent to administration officials to
keep quiet about Bush's statement accepting new taxes was
largely aimed at Kemp, who had spoken against such action.
Kemp's criticism of the GOP candidate for New York governor,
economist Pierre Rinfret, also rankles Republicans.
                                                                                                       

   MANDELA HOPES his good reception in the U.S. will help him
persuade Thatcher to weaken her opposition to South Africa
sanctions when he meets with her. His aides say the recent
decision by the EC to maintain sanctions also strengthens his
arguments to the British leader.
                                                                                                       

   WIVES AND AUTHORS: Michigan Republicans hoping for
pre-election bombshells in a book by Democratic Gov. James
Blanchard's former wife will be disappointed. So says Paula
Blanchard, who even plans to vote for her ex-husband. The
former wife of the GOP candidate, John Engler, also has
written a book but hasn't found a publisher.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS COMPETE with one another in the scramble for
election funds.
   Party leaders hope to pump at least $5 million into Harvey
Gantt's strong bid to upset North Carolina Sen. Helms, who
may raise $16 million. Ann Richards needs at least $8 million
for her Texas gubernatorial race against Clayton Williams,
who may spend $20 million. Dianne Feinstein hopscotches
California to raise $500,000 this week for her governorship
fight against the well-funded Pete Wilson.
   Some Democrats grumble that "big foot" candidates who
don't need money soak up donations. New Jersey Sen. Bradley,
who faces minimal opposition, has raised more than $5
million; he even had a fund-raiser in North Carolina last
year, but doesn't plan to donate to Gantt. Sens. Cranston,
Daschle and Sanford troll for money even though they don't
run until 1992.
   The 118 Senate candidates from both parties for 1990 have
already raised over $83 million and spent $47 million.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: No coattails: Bush's favorite clothing store,
Arthur Adler, is going out of business. . . . Name-dropping
delay: An invitation to hear Harvard law professor Laurence
Tribe discuss his new book apologizes that the date had to be
changed "due to Professor Tribe's commitment to meet with
Nelson Mandela." . . . What about Spooky Anderson? Baseball
Commissioner Fay Vincent and Baltimore Orioles manager Frank
Robinson speak at the CIA on "the art, science and philosophy
of baseball."
