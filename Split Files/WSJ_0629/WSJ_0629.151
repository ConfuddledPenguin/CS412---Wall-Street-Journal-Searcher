   Cyprus Minerals Co., a Denver-based mining company, said
it will write down about $27.5 million of its investment in
the Kanawha Coal Mine in West Virginia in the second quarter,
and may spend about $7 million in development costs at the
mine during the second half of the year.
   In the 1989 second quarter, Cyprus reported net income of
$61.7 million, or $1.48 a share, on revenue of $453.5
million. Net income included a net charge of $4.7 million and
a net special, one-time gain of $21.4 million. Analysts had
projected Cyprus's second-quarter 1990 earnings at about 85
cents to 90 cents a share. That was in the ballpark before
the write-down, a company spokesman said, but now that
estimate is too high.

   Cyprus, which acquired the property for $20 million in
March of 1989, attributed problems at the mine to
lower-than-anticipated reserves from the mountain-top mining
area, higher-than-expected reclamation costs and poor
performance of its highwall mining machines.
