   NEW YORK -- Dianne Soto teeters across the housing project
courtyard in her three-inch white satin heels toward the
waiting pink and white limousine. At $35 an hour, the limo is
a splurge. But Miss Soto and her four girlfriends thought it
was worth the money. After all, Chelsea Vocational High
School is having its first prom in more than a decade, and
its organizers should arrive in style.
   Over the blare of calypso music, Schela Brun, 17, explains
the absence of dates. With only 25 girls in a senior class of
133, it would seem that there are plenty of eligible
bachelors. "You can't go with just one," Miss Brun observes
as she adjusts her white-lace strapless dress, "or all the
others would be jealous and fight."

   Six years ago, Chelsea Vocational opened its doors to
girls for the first time since its founding in 1920. This
year, all the class officers are girls. And they are getting
what they want -- a prom with all the trimmings. A revolving
mirrored ball. Balloon bouquets in blue and gold, the school
colors. Party favors. A $60-a-plate buffet with crudites and
dip, fruit salad, and top round of beef. So what if it is a
month later than every other school prom?
   "We've worked so hard for it," Miss Soto says. "At first
everyone wanted a prom, but they didn't think we could do it.
Once it was organized, some kids backed out at the last
minute. We had to collect the money and make it work -- and
we did."
   The hotel deposit was a big hurdle. The Summit Hotel in
Manhattan had to have $250 by mid-May for the late-June
event. So the girls went from desk to desk to raise the
money. They managed to come up with $280. In the end, turnout
was better than anyone expected: 60 total, 40 from the
graduating class.
   Chelsea's students come from all over New York City to
this small high school in a residential section of lower
Manhattan. For some, the school is an opportunity to learn a
trade: computers, electronics, photocopier repair. For
others, it is an opportunity to escape a tough or dangerous
school in their own neighborhood. Miss Brun says that's one
of the reasons she went to Chelsea: "Drugs."
   Not that Chelsea is immune to problems. Steven Lopez, one
of the six teenagers indicted for the rape of a jogger in
Central Park, is a sophomore here. Two members of the
graduating class are teenage mothers.
   Class vice president Sabrina Soto's 5 1/2-month-old
daughter, Crystal Marie, is home with family on prom night.
Miss Soto, who is not related to Dianne, is wearing a regal
purple dress gathered at the hip and shoes dyed to match. "I
had my daughter and finished school," she says proudly. "It
was tough but I did it. And tonight we're all celebrating
what we've achieved."
   If the students are shy or awkward in this formal setting,
it is not around each other or their teachers, but with the
hotel staff. Tracy Noel, a soft-spoken young man who will
join the Navy in September, finishes his dinner and spots a
waiter eyeing his empty plate. "Excuse me, sir" Mr. Noel
asks. "Where should I put this?"
   It's not every day that a 17-year-old sports a tuxedo, so
more than one young man glances in the ballroom's
smoked-glass mirrors to make sure he got his money's worth.
In those desperate few moments before the photographer's
flash pops, Peter Willis practices his stance in a mirror.
Should he smile or look oh-so-seriously into the camera? He
orders an 8-by-10 print of himself in his rented tuxedo.
"I'll also get one with my date and one with my friends," he
says.
   Most students arrive without dates, and the partners on
the dance floor change as quickly as the beat. The music
ranges from slow numbers by Whitney Houston to 2 Live Crew's
controversial single, "Me So Horny." "Let's make a party]"
shouts the deejay, a podiatry student who rushed in still
wearing his hospital whites under a sports jacket.
   In a few days, the senior class will scatter. A few
members plan to go to college in the fall. Many more are
thinking about getting jobs. Five have signed up to serve in
the armed forces, including the valedictorian, Rhazine Brown.
Kenneth Roberts says he is joining the Navy because
recruiters promised he would see the world. "First, I'm going
to Chicago," he says excitedly. "Then I'm going to go to
Virginia."
   Caroline Lavelle wants more for her students, more than
Chicago, more than just any old job in Brooklyn. It
frustrates her. "Maybe the hardest thing is that the kids are
happy with so little," the English teacher says. "I say they
could have done better and they say, `But Miss Lavelle, I
passed.'"
   Under her picture in the yearbook, Noemi Rivera, 17,
requested that "Lawyer" be listed as her ambition. "Everybody
asks me why I'd go to school for seven more years, but for me
the more I know the better I feel," she says. Miss Rivera
says she is going to a local community college in the fall.
Eventually, she wants to study criminal justice at John Jay
College in Manhattan.
   Seniors dedicated the prom to Nelson Mandela and to Ruth
Rondon, class secretary, who helped organize the prom and
whose father died only weeks before. Ruth told her friends
she didn't want to go, but Dianne Soto and Miss Rivera say
they knew it was because she didn't have the money.
   So they took up a collection, and Miss Soto lent her a
black lace dress. Mr. Roberts wrote and performed -- in white
tails -- a rap song in her honor: "The next lovely lady, her
job is secretary, all respect due to Ruthie, the legendary."
   To announce the students voted by the class to be the
prom's royal couple, Robert Mitchell, a teacher who has
volunteered to chaperone, takes the microphone in the center
of the dance floor. "And the King and Queen of the Chelsea
Prom are . . . Hector Ramirez and Dianne Soto]"
   They lead the next dance, a slow one. Mr. Ramirez and Miss
Soto wear their coveted tiaras for the rest of the evening.
They hadn't arrived together, but they spend much of the
remaining evening that way.
   At midnight, after the last dance, the students agree to
gather at Orchard Beach in the Bronx to watch the sun come
up. Thinking ahead, someone loads a half-eaten sheet cake
from the buffet into a limousine.
   And what about next year? Will there be a second annual
prom for Chelsea Vocational? "It's up to the next class,"
Miss Soto says. "We just proved it could be done."
