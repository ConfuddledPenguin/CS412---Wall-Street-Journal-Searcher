   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Birmingham Steel Corp. said it plans
to spend $35 million to $45 million to double the melting
capacity and upgrade the rolling operation at its Jackson,
Miss., mini-mill.
   The mini-mill operator said it has begun engineering and
environmental-impact studies for the proposed project, which
includes replacing the melt shop furnace and continuous
caster. The company said the expansion project, which should
be completed in the summer of 1992, will enable the company
to take advantage of the growing Southeast steel market.
