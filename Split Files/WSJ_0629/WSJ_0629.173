   The top officers of Baptist Press, a prominent religious
news service used by nearly 500 newspapers and magazines
nationwide, are being forced out of their jobs, apparently as
a result of a bitter factional fight within the Southern
Baptist Convention, which owns the news service.
   Al Shackleford, 58 years old, director of Baptist Press,
based in Nashville, Tenn., said he and editor Dan Martin, 51,
were told to resign by Sept. 30 or they would "be dealt with
harshly." Mr. Shackleford said the decision to force them out
was made by the denomination's executive committee, which
offered no explanation.

   Neither Harold Bennett, the executive committee's
president, nor Sam Pace, its chairman, could be reached for
comment.
   Mr. Martin said he believed that fundamentalists, who
dominate both the executive committee and the denomination,
"want their own minister of information" in charge of
Southern Baptist news. Fundamentalists believe the Bible is
literally correct in matters of religion, science and
history.
   Mr. Martin added that the executive committee frequently
complained about news stories but "never offered us any
direction."
   Mr. Shackleford and Mr. Martin said they were told that if
they resigned quietly they could receive up to six months'
severance pay -- but only if they told the editors of Baptist
newspapers across the country not to come to their defense.
Mr. Shackleford said he has no plans to resign; Mr. Martin
said he hasn't decided what to do.
   Founded in 1947, Baptist Press provides about a dozen
pages of news stories about the Southern Baptist Convention,
the nation's largest Protestant denomination, to 480
newspapers, magazines and other institutions on weekdays. The
news service maintains bureaus in Washington, Atlanta,
Dallas, Nashville and Richmond, Va. Its stories are reprinted
in 39 state Baptist newspapers, whose combined circulation is
more than 1.6 million.
   For much of the past decade, Baptist Press has been under
increasing pressure as a result of turmoil within the
Southern Baptist Convention. Fundamentalists, who recently
wrested control of the denomination from a more moderate
faction, have charged that the news service has aggravated
the schism by frequently reporting on the split and that
Baptist Press stories have portrayed fundamentalists in a
negative light.
   In the mid-1980s, the Baptist Press Association asked
three journalism professors to examine the news service's
standards. The trio issued a report clearing Baptist Press of
charges of bias. One of the three, John Demott, a professor
at Memphis State University, praised Baptist Press as "a
model for denominational news services," but said that it now
risks becoming a "propaganda arm" of the fundamentalist
faction.
