   WASHINGTON -- By abandoning his no-tax pledge, President
Bush has taken a big economic gamble -- and left the Federal
Reserve System in control of the odds.
   Mr. Bush's economic advisers persuaded him to abandon the
pledge in part by arguing that a budget deal would help avoid
a recession before the 1992 election, administration
officials say.

   But many economists say a deficit-cutting budget deal
would have precisely the opposite effect. With the economy
already disturbingly weak, a $50 billion package of tax
increases and spending cuts could push it over the edge. "Any
serious cutback in the fiscal deficit," says Elliott Platt,
senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
"increases the chances of recession."
   Who's right? The answer to that question depends largely
on how -- and when -- the Federal Reserve reacts.
   Privately, administration officials say they hope the Fed
would respond to a budget deal by cutting short-term interest
rates one to 1 1/2 percentage points. Moreover, they'd like
to see the central bank clear the way for that move now, by
easing rates slightly at next week's meeting of the Fed's
policy committee. That would help struggling sectors of the
economy, such as real estate, and offset the depressing
effects of a deficit-cutting deal.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and departing Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson both have indicated to the White House that
they would ease rates, but only after a budget deal is
completed and long-term bond markets begin to respond
favorably. By then, administration economists fear, it could
be too late.
   "In terms of timing, the Fed ought to be starting nearly
right now" to offset the effects of a deficit-cutting
package, says former Nixon administration economic adviser
Paul McCracken. "Assuming the budget decision will be made in
the current session of Congress, monetary policy ought to be
becoming a little easier now."
   Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of
Economic Advisers, stepped up the pressure on the Fed
recently when he said in a television interview that it would
be "irresponsible" for the Fed not to ease rates in response
to a budget deal. Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican
who stays in close contact with the White House on budget
matters, also has been bashing the Fed.
   "If the economy of the United States were a patient," Sen.
Domenici says, "I would say it is time to get a second
opinion. The Fed is following a tight monetary policy as an
effort to cure inflation. However, the side effects of the
cure may very well be worse than the current ailment."
   Sen. Domenici also noted that the Fed's tight policy is
one reason budget-deficit estimates have increased recently.
"While it is clear that we need to get the deficit down," he
said, "the amount that can be cut without bringing on a
recession is reduced in a weak economy. And a weak economy
makes the size of the budget problem even larger. As Alice
discovered in Wonderland, it seems the faster we run to solve
the problem, the further behind we get."
   In part, the conflict arises because the government's
effort to eliminate the budget deficit over five years
coincides with a stated Fed goal of eliminating inflation
over the next five years. If the Fed eases as much as the
administration is asking, "there's a big risk of putting a
lot more inflation in the economy," says Steven Axilrod, a
former Fed staff member and vice chairman of Nikko Securities
Co. International Inc.
   To eliminate inflation and close the budget deficit at the
same time, economists say, it may be necessary to have a
recession, or at least slow the economy to the point that
unemployment rises substantially.
   Most economists agree that regardless of Fed policy,
cutting the budget deficit is good for the economy in the
long run. The deficit "is the devil's recipe for a
high-consuming society, and a low-domestic-savings,
low-capital-formation society," says Nobel-prize winning
economist Paul Samuelson. "That's the scientific truth."
   But politicians operate in the short term, and the
short-run effects of deficit-cutting are far less certain.
Mr. Samuelson said the president's advisers may have
exaggerated the dangers of the deficit over the past couple
of years "to try to scare him" into doing something.
