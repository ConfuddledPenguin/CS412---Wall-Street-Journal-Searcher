   NEW YORK -- A psychiatrist pleaded guilty to trading stock
on inside information he obtained during sessions with the
wife of financier Sanford I. Weill.
   Robert Howard Willis, accused of buying BankAmerica Corp.
stock based on information he received from a patient during
therapy, pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud in
federal court in New York.

   Dr. Willis admitted that he purchased BankAmerica stock
when he learned that Mr. Weill, former chief executive
officer of Shearson Loeb Rhodes, was seeking to become chief
executive of BankAmerica, according to a statement released
by the U.S. attorney's office in New York. In an opinion last
month, the judge in the case revealed that the patient who
allegedly disclosed the information to Dr. Willis was Mr.
Weill's wife. Mr. Weill is chairman of Primerica Corp.
   The case is believed to be the first to charge a doctor
with trading on confidential information received from a
patient.
   The two counts to which Dr. Willis pleaded guilty involved
the purchase of 400 shares of BankAmerica stock, according to
his lawyer, Edward Brodsky.
