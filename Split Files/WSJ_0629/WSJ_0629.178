   Winnebago Industries Inc., battered by an industrywide
slump in motor home sales, reported a loss for its third
quarter on a 21% decline in revenue.
   For the quarter, ended May 26, the maker of motor homes
had a loss of $4 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of
$89.7 million. A year earlier, Winnebago earned $301,000, or
two cents a share, on revenue of $112.9 million.

   The company, based in Forest City, Iowa, said results were
hurt by lower demand for motor homes, a shift to lower-priced
motor homes, start-up costs for its commercial vehicle
division, and a loss by its Cycle-Sat subsidiary.
   For the nine months, Winnebago had a loss of $14 million,
or 57 cents a share, compared with net income of $6.6
million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell
28% to $249.2 million from $348 million.
