   SALVAGING A SOVIET SUB

   A consortium of five Dutch companies led by the salvage
group Smit Internationale N.V. has been named by the Soviet
Design Bureau of Maritime Engineering to raise the sunken
Soviet nuclear submarine Komsomolets.
   The Komsomolets sank in April after a fire broke out on
the vessel while it was 125 miles north of the coast of
Norway in the Barents Sea. The wreck of the sub lies on the
ocean floor at a depth of 5,600 feet.
   "We will simply raise it and hand it over to the Soviets,"
said D.C. Kaakebeen, a spokesman for Smit. He noted that no
ship has ever been raised from a depth greater than 660 feet.
   The first phase of the operation, a viability study, is
scheduled to begin about the end of 1990, and Mr. Kaakebeen
said the group hopes to raise the sub sometime in the summer
of 1992.
                                                                                                       

   SETBACK TO BRAZIL PLAN
                                                                                                       

   Brazil's Supreme Court ruled 9-2 that President Fernando
Collor de Mello can't reduce the salaries of thousands of
government employees as part of a plan to cut spending. Mr.
Collor had said he would fire more than 300,000 of the
government's 1.4 million employees in a bid to trim a budget
deficit estimated at $31 billion. The court said Brazil must
continue to pay the civil servants in full until the court
issues a final ruling on the matter in a few months.
                                                                                                       

   FAILURE OF A TV BUSINESS CHANNEL
                                                                                                       

   The first European television business channel said this
would be its last week on the air. "Intense negotiations with
Swiss and foreign interests to provide more capital have
failed," Swiss-based European Business Channel, or EBC, said.
The channel, carried by satellite and cable, transmitted a
half-hour of business news in both English and German at
breakfast time and repeated the transmission later in the
day. The program began in November 1988 but failed to attract
enough advertising to cover costs. Most of EBC's 100
employees are based in Zurich.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE NOVELTY: A ROUND TRIP
                                                                                                       

   China's national airline will begin selling round-trip
tickets on July 1, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Until now, air travelers in China had to get to their
destination before buying tickets for their return. Often
this meant having to extend a stay because tickets were
unavailable on the desired day of departure. Xinhua said
booking offices for the Civil Aviation Administration of
China in 16 Chinese and 30 foreign cities would begin selling
return tickets. Round-trip tickets still won't be available
for train travel.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH COMPUTATIONS
                                                                                                       

   The French government neither gained nor lost money as a
result of the nationalizations and subsequent privatizations
of French companies during the 1980s, said the nation's
accounting agency. While the state's net outcome varied from
sector to sector, profits made from the sale of stock during
privatizations between 1986 and 1988 "more or less
compensated for" expenses incurred during the round of
nationalizations performed by the Mitterrand administration
in 1982, the agency said.
                                                                                                       

   A FIRST FOR THE GERMANYS
                                                                                                       

   Co op AG, the troubled West German retailing group, said
it has agreed to sell its stores in West Berlin to the East
German Association of Consumer Cooperatives, the first major
financial investment by an East German group in West Germany.
Co op said additional divestitures would reduce its annual
sales volume to about four billion marks ($2.4 billion) from
11 billion marks in 1989. The East German Association, which
operates a chain of cooperative food retailers in East
Germany, will acquire the 120 Co op stores in West Berlin,
including administration, warehouses, and its motor pool.
Financial terms weren't disclosed.
                                                                                                       

   A BRITISH DEFEAT
                                                                                                       

   Britain's Common Cold Research Center is closing tomorrow,
44 years after opening its doors in a hospital near
Salisbury, England.
   "Going back in time, we used to think there was only one
cold virus. Now we know there are nearly 200, so there is no
chance of finding a vaccine," said Administrator Arthur Amos.
"We've been trying to find a compound that acts on a family
of viruses, but we've had no luck."
   Volunteers, who were bombarded with viruses, learned of
the project through newspaper advertisements and
word-of-mouth. They ranged in age from 18 to 50, and some
were repeat participants. One couple met there and returned
the following year for their honeymoon.
   One man went through the 10-day quarantine program 26
times. Mr. Amos's opinion of that man: "a rather odd sort of
person."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   China's legislature passed the nation's first flag law,
with stipulations demanding punishment for those damaging the
national emblem. The law also forbids the use of the flag in
ads or as a trademark. . . . Cuba's President Fidel Castro
donated blood for injured survivors of the Iranian earthquake
following a nationwide appeal by Cuba's Health Ministry.
