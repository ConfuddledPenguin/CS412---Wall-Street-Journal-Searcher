   DETROIT -- Gentex Corp. expects that earnings for the
second quarter will fall below year-ago levels, and could be
close to the break-even point because of slower-than-expected
sales of its automotive mirrors, executive vice president
Kenneth LaGrand said in an interview.
   The company's main business is auto mirrors, but it also
makes fire-protection products.

   "We're struggling to do about $5 million in revenues in
this quarter, compared to $5.74 million in 1989," Mr. LaGrand
said. With quarterly revenues at the $5 million level, "we
are operating at the break-even point," Mr. LaGrand said.
Depending on the final revenue figures, Gentex could see
second-quarter earnings ranging from breaking even to four
cents a share, or about $275,000 to $300,000, Mr. LaGrand
said. In the year-ago second quarter, Gentex earned nine
cents a share, or $553,247 on $5.7 million in revenue. The
company has about 7.5 million shares outstanding compared
with 6.2 million shares outstanding a year ago.
   The major problem is a sharp drop in sales of Gentex's
older motorized mirrors, Mr. LaGrand said. The company
expects to sell about 21,000 motorized mirrors in the second
quarter, down from about 60,000 a year earlier. That drop "is
faster than we expected" and is the result of weak demand for
certain domestic car models, he said. The company is still
increasing sales of its newer, "electrochromic" mirrors,
which use a patented process to automatically cut reflected
headlight glare, he said.
   The weaker-than-expected second quarter and first-half
performance could hold earnings for the full year in a range
between 27 cents a share, or $2 million, and 33 cents a
share, or about $2.5 million, Mr. LaGrand said. Sales for the
year will likely be in a range between $25 million and $27
million, he said. In 1989, Gentex earned $2.1 million, or 31
cents a share, on sales of $23.8 million. Gentex officials
had expected to do significantly better in 1990.
   But company officials and analysts have been trimming
their earnings forecasts in recent weeks in light of slumping
Big Three car sales and output. Mr. LaGrand said analysts who
expect the company to earn between two cents and four cents a
share in the second quarter are now at the "high end" of the
likely range. Projections that full-year earnings will be as
high as 37 cents a share are also "at the high end" of the
likely range, he said.
   Mr. LaGrand said another factor in the earnings squeeze is
that Gentex hasn't cut research and development spending, or
expenses related to selling more auto makers on its new
mirror products.
   Gentex remains optimistic that sales and earnings will
rebound in the second half of this year and next year, Mr.
LaGrand said. The company expects the Big Three auto makers
to offer Gentex electrochromic mirrors as standard or
optional equipment on more models in the 1991 model year that
begins officially Oct. 1.
   "We're looking at unit {volume} increases for the Big
Three in the 30% to 35% range," he said. Gentex expects most
of that gain will come as a result of efforts by the auto
makers to market electrochromic mirrors more aggressively, he
said.
   In addition, Gentex has agreements to supply mirrors for
1991 models made by BMW AG of Germany and Rover Group Ltd. of
Britain. The company is also negotiating to supply mirrors to
a Japanese auto maker, Mr. LaGrand said.
