   TOKYO -- Almost all of Japan's major steelmakers reported
sizable gains in their fiscal 1990 pretax earnings, as a
result of strong demand from big domestic buyers such as
construction concerns and car companies.
   NKK Corp. was the only one that posted a profit decline
for the year ended March 31. NKK officials noted, as they did
when they released parent-company results in May, that the
drop resulted mostly from a change in the way the company
measures depreciation costs.

   The other steel manufacturers -- Nippon Steel Corp.,
Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Kobe Steel Ltd. and Kawasaki
Steel Corp. -- all showed profit growth.
   Officials at these companies traced the gains to brisk
demand from domestic steel users. As the economy continued to
expand during the year, they said, companies stepped up
production and boosted steel consumption.
   None of the steel companies provided consolidated sales
breakdowns. Neither did they make earnings predictions for
the current fiscal year.
   Nippon Steel's pretax earnings climbed 25% to 219.94
billion yen ($1.42 billion) from 175.58 billion yen. Net
income surged 50% to 117.14 billion yen, or 17.01 yen a
share, from 78.07 billion yen, or 11.76 yen a share.
   Sales amounted to 2.972 trillion yen, up 13% from 2.635
trillion yen in fiscal 1989.
   Sumitomo reported pretax earnings of 101.56 billion yen, a
13% increase from 90.14 billion yen. Net dropped 32%,
however, to 39.38 billion yen, or 13.05 yen a share, from
58.04 billion yen, or 20.83 yen a share.
   Sumitomo's sales came to 1.805 trillion yen, up 48% from
1.223 trillion yen.
   Kobe's pretax earnings grew 21% to 61.57 billion yen from
50.84 billion yen. Net dropped 9% to 23.26 billion yen, or
8.25 yen a share, from 25.45 billion yen, or 10.02 yen a
share.
   Cutting into Kobe's profit were costs involving the
establishment of pension funds, which came to 9.08 billion
yen. In fiscal 1989, there were no such costs.
   Sales totaled 1.325 trillion yen, up 6% from 1.248
trillion yen.
   Kawasaki posted a 10% increase in pretax earnings to
108.65 billion yen from 98.42 billion yen. Net rose 15% to
55.87 billion yen, or 18.32 yen a share, from 48.53 billion
yen, or 16.54 yen a share.
   Sales were 1.214 trillion yen, up 6% from 1.141 trillion
yen.
   NKK's pretax earnings went down 19% to 85.92 billion yen
from 105.7 billion yen. Net plunged 57% to 39.19 billion yen,
or 11.13 yen a share, from 91.7 billion yen, or 28.76 yen a
share.
   Pushing down net were a 93% drop in extraordinary gains,
including those from sales of fixed assets and securities,
and a 230% jump in extraordinary losses.
   "Without special factors," a company official said,
"business wasn't that bad during the year." NKK's sales
increased 5% to 1.448 trillion yen from 1.379 trillion yen.
