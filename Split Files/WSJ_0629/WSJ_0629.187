   Crude oil inventories have hit their highest level in
eight years, raising the possibility of tumbling world
petroleum prices if OPEC doesn't soon rein in production.
   Persian Gulf heavyweights, who dominate policy-making
within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, so
far have averted a price war, but have recently been cutting
their third-quarter contract prices in an effort to protect
their market shares. Price reductions by Saudi Arabia on
crude for delivery during July were quickly followed by
similar moves from Iran. Kuwait, which just completed its
negotiations for July, has undercut Saudi pricing slightly on
certain types of crude, oil experts said.

   Even before those moves, oil prices had declined by more
than $8 a barrel since the beginning of the year, reflecting
mushrooming global stocks, which have risen by as much as 250
million barrels. Not since the end of 1982 has so much oil
been on hand. Terminals in Europe and the Caribbean, a
crucial storage area for U.S. markets, are mostly full. More
than half of the oil tankers currently under charter are
being used for storage rather than shipping.
   Despite the glut, futures prices of oil traded at the New
York Mercantile Exchange rose on talk by Saddam Hussein of
Iraq of the potential for war in the Middle East. In
addition, the threat of a strike in the Norwegian North Sea
oil fields as early as Monday has made some sellers more
reluctant. "If a strike materializes, it could bolster
prices," said Lawrence Goldstein, president of Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation.
   But these worries don't eliminate the hard fact that there
is a huge surplus of crude in the market, experts say. And as
prices for some lesser grades of crude have slipped below $15
a barrel, OPEC strategists have wondered whether they are
about to see a rerun of the 1986 price collapse. While a boon
for some oil consumers, that plunge rocked the oil industry
and played havoc with some national and regional economies as
well as with the banks that underwrote billions of dollars of
oil-collateralized debt.
   Oil ministers from OPEC's Persian Gulf nations are
expected to gather some time next month in Taif, Saudi
Arabia, to begin working on a strategy that would head off
any similar price decline. The meeting would be in advance of
OPEC's full ministerial meeting on July 25 in Geneva, which
would be attended by all members.
   Meantime, OPEC's acting president Sadek Boussena has been
on a whirlwind tour of Persian Gulf oil producers, trying to
find a way to reduce output and prop up prices. Some OPEC
members are also jawboning Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates, the cartel's two notorious overproducers, which
have almost single-handedly caused this year's price decline.
   Kuwait's new oil minister, Rashid Salem Al-Omari, met with
Saudi minister Hisham Nazer to discuss the oversupply
problem. And during the last month, Iraq has attempted to
pressure Kuwait into reducing output through editorials in
Iraqi newspapers. Iraq accuses Kuwait of purposely
overproducing to keep oil prices low, which in turn would
deny Iraq the revenue it needs to rebuild its war-torn
economy -- and its already-feared military machine.
   In the latest step in Iraq's campaign, President Hussein
recently sent his deputy oil minister to Kuwait with a
message warning the sheikdom to restrain output because it
was harming Iraq and other OPEC producers by exceeding its
OPEC-assigned quota.
   Even as OPEC members haggle among themselves in efforts to
strike yet another production-limiting bargain, the
credibility of any agreement that might be reached is under
suspicion. "We now factor OPEC cheating into all of our
short-term pricing forecasts," claims William Hermann, chief
economist for Chevron Corp.
   By not adhering to the daily output ceiling of 22 million
barrels it agreed upon in April, OPEC flooded the market with
crude during the weakest demand period of the year. OPEC
output since April has ballooned at times as high as 23.9
million barrels a day, according to some estimates. Daily
production during June has eased back to between 23 million
and 23.2 million barrels.
   But OPEC is going to have to pump a lot less crude than
that if it expects to return oil prices to the $18-a-barrel
level it has been aiming for. Estimates currently put the
price for the OPEC basket of crudes at less than $13.75 a
barrel.
   Until yesterday, even the strike threatened for early next
week in the North Sea hadn't provided any psychological
strength to the market, although it is already shy of North
Sea barrels. Because of maintenance programs, only 18 cargoes
of North Sea Brent are available for purchase during July,
down from 32 in April. A strike in Norway's North Sea fields
would cut off 1.6 million barrels of daily production. The
shortfall of North Sea crude has failed to prop up prices,
says Peter Gignoux, who runs the energy desk for Shearson
Lehman Hutton in London.
   If OPEC can reduce its production to below 23 million
barrels a day, prices should begin to strengthen as winter
demand for oil starts to materialize. Demand for OPEC crude
during the third quarter is pegged by industry analysts at
about 22.5 million barrels a day, rising during the fourth
quarter to 23 million.
   Market participants say they aren't going to settle for
mere OPEC rhetoric this time. They want to see action. "At
the April meeting, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia said they would
cut back and the market bought it," said Ed Krapels of Energy
Security Analysis Inc. "But then the truth came out -- only
the Saudis cut. Sheik Ali (former Kuwait oil minister) didn't
abide by the agreement. OPEC isn't going to be able to talk
this market up again."
