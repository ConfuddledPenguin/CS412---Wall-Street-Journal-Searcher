   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it agreed to

   A Bristol-Myers spokeswoman said S+G Implants, a Lubeck,
West Germany, maker of hip and knee implants with annual
sales equivalent to $12 million, will complement the implant
operations of Bristol-Myers's Zimmer division.
   She said Jobst Institute, a Toledo, Ohio, maker of
specialty medical products with $50 million in annual sales,
no longer fit into the company's long-term growth plans.
Jobst has been a Bristol-Myers subsidiary since 1983.
