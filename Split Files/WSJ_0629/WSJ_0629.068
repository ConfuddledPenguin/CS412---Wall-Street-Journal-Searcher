   LOS ANGELES -- Leo's Industries Inc., benefiting from a
strong performance by its cellular phone unit, posted net
income for the year ended March 31 of $3.7 million, or 90
cents a share, on a 25% increase in revenue.
   Revenue rose to $82.7 million from $65.9 million.

   Leo's, which also operates a chain of 40
consumer-electronics stores, had a 1989 net loss of $2.4
million, or 59 cents a share. Those results included a $2.9
million loss from the sale of an unprofitable stereo-speaker
manufacturing unit.
   The company's 20th Century Cellular Inc. unit buys
cellular service from licensed carriers and resells the
service to subscribers.
   Paul M. Cohen, Leo's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the unit, which has more than 10,000 subscribers, is
currently adding 1,650 subscribers a month. The business is
generating revenue of more than $1.3 million a month, he
said.
   For the fourth quarter, historically its poorest, the
company approximately broke even, said Mr. Cohen. He added
that those results were achieved without commissions Leo's
earned in last year's fourth quarter as an agent for a Los
Angeles cellular carrier. Now that the company is a reseller,
it no longer receives those commissions.
