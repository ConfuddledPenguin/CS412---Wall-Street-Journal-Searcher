   First Federal Bancorp, Pontiac, Mich., said the investor
group that recently offered to infuse the bank with $40
million has withdrawn its offer.
   According to First Federal, the investor group said its
decision was based on conversations with its adviser
regarding the ability to attain the group's objectives in a
non-assisted transaction. First Federal announced the offer
last month, when it identified the group only as current
shareholders.

   At that time First Federal also disclosed that the Office
of Thrift Supervision had limited the operations of two of
its subsidiaries, First Federal Savings Bank &amp; Trust, and
Citizens Federal Savings Bank. The federal regulators took
that action because the subsidiaries failed to meet new
federal capital requirements.
   Leo D. Ottoni, First Federal chief executive officer, said
the bank holding company will continue its attempts to comply
with the tougher capital requirements.
