   WASHINGTON -- Amid fear of voter anger over the expanding
savings-and-loan debacle, a House Banking subcommittee
approved legislation to authorize an additional $154 million
over the next two years for investigating and prosecuting
crimes involving failed thrifts.
   The bill, approved unanimously yesterday, also would make
it easier for government investigators to discover and punish
S&amp;L fraud. One provision would establish new authority for
civil regulators to use tax records in thrift investigations.
President Bush has expressed support for many of the expanded
enforcement powers in the bill.

   The new authorization would allow S&amp;L enforcement spending
by the Justice and Treasury departments on top of the $75
million already appropriated by the full House for fiscal
1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   The legislation approved yesterday, which is thought to
have a strong chance of being enacted, would make concealing
assets from thrift regulators a federal crime. It would also
establish a new statute barring fraudulent conveyances of
assets by thrift executives and allowing enforcers to undo
such transactions even if they have been completed.
   The bill would increase wiretap authority for financial
fraud investigators and would expand the government's ability
to freeze assets before the conclusion of legal proceedings
over alleged S&amp;L-related fraud. It would also prevent S&amp;L
defendants from using state bankruptcy laws to shield their
personal assets.
