   NEW YORK -- News that the government's thrift bailout
agency will soon auction 30-year bonds, rather than the
oddball 40-year variety, provided a late-day boost to the
bond market.
   Bond prices opened as much as 3/8 point higher -- a gain
of $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount -- and stuck at
those levels through most of the day as investors continued
to cheer Wednesday's successful four-year note auction.
Optimism that efforts are underway to cut the size of the
budget deficit also helped the market.

   When the Treasury Department announced that Resolution
Funding Corp. will auction 30-year "bailout bonds" on July
10, trading activity perked up a bit.
   The Treasury's 30-year benchmark bond ended nearly 1/2
point higher while the issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.44%.
   Refcorp is the federal agency that raises money to finance
the government's massive bailout of the troubled savings and
loan industry. Details of the auction, including the size of
the offering, will be announced July 3.
   The next auction will be Refcorp's fourth and will mark
the agency's return to issuing 30-year bonds after selling
40-year bonds in January and April. Although the 40-year bond
auctions were considered flops at the time of the sale,
demand for the securities picked up later when the securities
were "stripped." Strips are created when dealers separate the
interest-paying "coupon" portion of a bond from the principle
or "corpus" portion and sell the two parts separately. Strips
are also divided into different maturities.
   John Costas, co-manager of government trading at First
Boston Corp., said the Refcorp news helped the market because
it relieved some worries about possible supply pressures.
Thirty-year bonds, which have broad investor appeal, are
easier to sell than forty-year bonds.
   Mr. Costas said that another 40-year bond offering might
have saturated the market with "interest only" 40-year
strips, which are not very popular. But, he said, demand for
the "principal" portion, often called a zero-coupon bond, has
been strong.
   Government officials said the decision to issue 30-year,
rather than 40-year, bonds largely reflects the government's
need for large amounts of cash. And because 30-year bonds are
easier to sell than 40-year bonds, the Treasury said it can
raise the size of the auctions without disrupting the market.
   "We have to raise more money than we did at the last
auction" because the thrift industry bailout process is
speeding up, said Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary
of federal finance at the U.S. Treasury.
   "If we have to raise more money, I felt we would be better
off selling a 30-year bond," said Mr. Basham.
   Treasury officials have indicated the size of the sale
will be between $4 billion and $6 billion, up from the $3.5
billion of 40-year "bailout" bonds sold at the April auction.
   Mr. Basham said Wall Street also seemed to favor a 30-year
bond this time around.
   "At the last auction, the investment community had a
strong preference for a 40-year bond, but we didn't get a
strong response {for a 40-year issue} from the investment
community this time," he said.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at price of
103 8/32 to yield 8.44% compared with 102 26/32 to yield
8.48% on Wednesday. Ten-year notes ended at 102 23/32 to
yield 8.46% compared with 102 11/32 to yield 8.50%.
   Meanwhile, the discount rate on threemonth Treasury bills
ended at 7.75% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.99% while the
rate on six-month notes fell to 7.63% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.02%.
   The Treasury sold $10.26 billion of 52week bills yesterday
at an average discount rate of 7.52%.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   The bills are dated July 5, 1990 and mature July 5, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt securities ended 1/8 to 3/8 point higher.
   Despite a lack of bonds available in the secondary market,
traders reported good activity from investors looking to add
to slim inventories.
   In new-issue dealings, a Lehman Brothers group tentatively
priced $60 million Illinois Student Assistance Commission
student loan revenue bonds to yield from 6.60% in 1995 to
7.38% in 2003.
   Among actively quoted bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 ended 1/4 point higher
at 98 1/4 to yield 7.34%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Canadian bond prices ended modestly lower in dull trading,
as profit-taking dented the market's upward momentum of the
past few days.
   Traders said there was little reaction in the Canadian
bond market to news that Canada's gross domestic product was
unchanged in April from March or to news that Canadian
manufacturers operated at 80.4% of capacity in the first
quarter, down from 82% in the fourth quarter.
   Canada's benchmark 10-year 10.5% bond due 2000 was quoted
late yesterday afternoon at a price of 98.950, down 0.10
percentage point, to yield 10.67%.
   In other markets, British government bonds ended slightly
firmer as the pound rebounded against some other major
currencies. Britain's 11.75% benchmark bond due 2003/2007 was
up 2/32 at 102 28/32 to yield 11.32%.
   West German government bonds ended slightly higher in
directionless trading. Dealers say the market remains trapped
in a narrow range. Bonn's 10-year benchmark 8.75% bond was up
0.15 point to 100.20 to yield 8.71%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Robust gains in the junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. led the
junk-bond market higher, sparking buying interest in some of
the market's better quality "Go-Go" issues.
   The active buying was triggered by reports that RJR
Nabisco is proposing to reset the interest rate on $2.6
billion of pay-in-kind bonds at 16.5%. Pay-in-kind bonds pay
interest in the form of additional securities as opposed to
cash.
   RJR Nabisco's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished up 2 1/4 points at 103 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The 14.07% exchangeable pay-in-kind
debentures, maturing in 2007, ended 1 3/8 points higher at 84
1/8.
   Most actively traded junk bonds posted gains of about 3
3/8 point. Some notable exceptions, however, were Quantum
Chemical Corp. and Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.
   Carter Hawley Hale's 12.5% senior subordinated debentures
ended down 3 5/8 points at 79 7/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange while Quantum's 12.5% senior subordinated notes
ended 1/2 point lower at 88.
   The bonds of Interco Inc. slipped on concern that the
furniture maker will skip upcoming interest payments on its 8
7/8% notes. The notes fell one point to 63.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities maintained a modestly firm
tone.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for July delivery finished up 7/32 at 99 6/32 to yield 9.75%.
   In another sector, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
securities closed up 7/32 at 98 18/32 to yield 9.73%.
   Traders weren't expecting the session's gains to be much
larger, saying that hesitation to build positions as the
quarter ends and as the July Fourth holiday and June
employment report approach would likely take the edge off any
rally.
   In the primary market, a $500 million Freddie Mac
five-year noncallable debenture issue, being sold by Freddie
Mac's 18-member securities dealer group, was priced as 8.70%
securities at par.
