   MOSCOW -- So the West wants to bail out Mikhail Gorbachev.
Germany and France have proposed a $20 billion subsidy, the
usual suspects are signing on and George Bush has sent up a
trial balloon. But what if the better Russians don't want to
be bailed out by the West?
   Wandering around this city-that-doesn't-work (Manila on
the Moscow) this week, I put the question of Western aid to a
variety of reformers. Politicians, journalists, economists --
these are the people who want to go beyond Mr. Gorbachev's
inchoate reforms to create private property and democratic
politics. They are the ones who will have to prevail if
Russia ("U.S.S.R." will soon be passe) is ever going to join
the civilized, developed world. Aid for Gorby? Every single
reformer is ambivalent at the very least, and usually
flat-out opposed.

   "Sometimes I think the worst enemies of democracy in my
country are democrats in the West," says Ilya Zaslavsky, a
member of the reformist Interregional Group of Deputies in
the Soviet parliament. "You are always trying to help our
dictatorship." Mr. Zaslavsky is slight, has hair that is
early-Beatles and like most Russians has a well honed gift
for irony.
   But his view is hardly eccentric. I couldn't find a single
reformer, moderate or radical, who endorsed Western help to
today's Kremlin. The current system is understood as a black
hole.

   Andrei Anikin, a prominent economist, figures the
government wasted $200 billion during the oil-price boom of
the 1970s. Alexander Bogomolov, a young establishment
economist (his father, Oleg, is an adviser to Boris Yeltsin),
says the Gorbachev regime has already squandered billions in
recent loans from West Germany.
   "In the current structure, aid is useless," says Mr.
Bogomolov. "We have no economic or political mechanisms that
would let us use it effectively." The elder Bogomolov tells
my colleague Peter Gumbel he feels the same way.
   Of course, the more seductive argument is that Western aid
would somehow leverage free-market reform. Some reformers are
willing to try this, though less to assist Mr. Gorbachev than
to twist his arm. Mr. Anikin, despairing of any new Gorbachev
ideas for at least another year, wants the International
Monetary Fund or the United Nations (]) to more or less
dictate reform. Mr. Bogomolov hopes the West will treat
economic reform the way it has arms control -- negotiating
Soviet concessions. Still others agree that the Kremlin is
hopeless, but would welcome aid to the newly democratic local
governments in such cities as Leningrad and Moscow.
   But the difficulties are obvious. Do Americans really want
to take credit for raising prices for bread and rent? This is
also not a banana republic case of selling a few hundred
state enterprises; the entire country is a state enterprise.
The Soviet parliament recently spent three days deciding that
"individual" (though, strangely, not "private") property is
all right, but land must still be owned by the state. As for
aiding cities, it's hard to imagine George Bush or Helmut
Kohl telling Mr. Gorbachev they're going to write checks to
his political rivals in Leningrad.
   A visit with a budding Russian "capitalist" isn't
reassuring, either. Igor Grishenko is blond, only 31 years
old and claims to make 3,500 rubles a month (the Soviet
average is some 240). He runs a Moscow "cooperative," the
only kind of legal private enterprise. But his clients are
state ministries, he had to buy his building from city hall
and he neatly dodges a question about political payoffs. In
any case, even Mr. Grishenko says, "we can do without"
foreign subsidy.
   The reformers' best point is more political than economic,
going to the heart of what they call their 73-year-old
"insanity." Western liberals approach the Soviet Union as
just another repair job: Change the carburetor and spark
plugs and it'll be back on the road again. Reform the
currency to mop up the "ruble overhang" and everyone will be
in business.

   Russian reformers know better. Over and over again a
visitor hears from reformers that they long to live in a
"normal" society. They know their system now is abnormal,
absurd. It nurtures a culture of bribery. (Anecdote: A
five-minute phone call to the U.S. costs $50, but the hotel
operator appears in a guest's room at 5 a.m. to say it will
cost only $25 -- if you pay her then in greenbacks.) Theft is
encouraged; work is punished.
   As Yuri Shekochikhin, another reformer in the parliament,
puts it: "We have two economies -- a corrupt official one,
and a quick, efficient one that's illegal. Why don't we
legalize the black one?" He answers his own question: Because
the corrupt system exists to sustain the power of the
communist "nomenklatura". The Party still owns 95% of the
means of production. "We must change this oligarchical
system," adds Mr. Zaslavsky. "This one knows how to eat, but
not how to produce." Foreign aid in this system will do
little more than increase the velocity of the bribes.
   It's probably true that this is exactly what the Germans
intend, and they don't much care. Chancellor Kohl wants to
pay a ransom for German unification and to keep Gorby from
meddling in German elections later this year. The "dirigiste"
French also like ideas that enhance their international
influence while spending other people's money. But the U.S.
has other priorities. George Bush once said he didn't want to
jeopardize Soviet reform by "doing dumb things -- that's my
cautious approach." Here's his chance to prove it.
