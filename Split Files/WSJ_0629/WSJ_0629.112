   BOSTON -- Lotus Development Corp. won a closely watched
lawsuit in which it charged that Paperback Software
International had violated its copyright on its best-selling
1-2-3 program.
   Federal District Court Judge Robert Keeton ruled that
"liability for infringement" of Lotus's copyright was
established by Lotus in the three-year-old case.

   Software copyrights have been a contentious issue in the
software industry since Lotus filed its suit against
Paperback, which is based in Berkeley, Calif. Paperback's VP
Planner program used different computer code than Lotus's
1-2-3, but its commands and user interface -- the screens and
keystrokes that the user sees and uses -- were so similar as
to violate Lotus's copyright, Judge Keeton ruled. He called
the copying "overwhelming and pervasive."
   Judge Keeton's 113-page ruling was issued late yesterday
afternoon in Boston. The ruling isn't likely to have much
financial impact on Lotus, which analysts say has maintained
its dominant 60% market share despite competition from
clonemakers such as Paperback and other software companies.
   However, "it's going to be a long hot summer for the
defendants in all the pending software copyright suits," said
Robert Therrien, an analyst with PaineWebber.
   Apple Computer Inc. is suing Microsoft Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Inc. over alleged violations of its copyright
on the Macintosh computer interface. "There's a strong
probability that Apple has a good case," Mr. Therrien said.
   Many computer law experts had predicted that Lotus would
win the case, based on the growing body of software copyright
law. "This is going to re-emphasize that screen displays are
copyrightable subject matter even if the underlying code is
different in the two products," said John Yates, an Atlanta
computer law specialist who represented Digital
Communications Associates Inc., Alpharetta, Ga. in its
successful copyright-infringement suit against Softklone
Distributing Corp.
   Thomas Lemberg, Lotus's vice president and general
counsel, said the ruling "is definitive. It is a major
victory and we feel very good about it." Henry Gutman,
Lotus's outside counsel on the case, added, "It's a very
important decision."
   Mr. Lemberg said that Lotus expects to request an
injunction prohibiting Paperback from continuing to sell VP
Planner at a conference that Judge Keeton scheduled for July
19. The issue of damages in the case had been reserved for a
separate phase of the trial.
   Attorneys for Paperback couldn't be reached for comment.
   In his ruling, Judge Keeton said that he didn't find the
concept of a copyright on "look and feel" of a program to be
"significantly helpful." Many software lawyers, frustrated by
the difficulties of defining what elements make a program
creative and innovative have used the phrase "look and feel,"
which is borrowed from copyright decisions on music, plays
and novels. He said he preferred the concept of a user
interface.
   Judge Keeton said that some aspects of the user interface
weren't evidence of copyright violation. For example, what he
called the "rotated `L' " arrangement of headings for rows
and columns and the use of the slash key to start commands,
aren't copyrightable he said.
   However, he said that the menu of commands that a user can
invoke, such as copy, move, file "is capable of being
expressed in many . . . ways." He noted that other
spreadsheets, including Microsoft's Excel have very different
command menus. And he concluded that the menu is a key
element of 1-2-3's user interface, which "is the aspect that
has made 1-2-3 so popular."
   In a separate development, Lotus shifted responsibility
for some jobs among vice presidents and hired a new vice
president from Apple Computer Inc.
   Lotus named Donald P. Casey, Apple's vice president of
networking and engineering, as its new vice president of the
spreadsheet division, in charge of its key revenue source.
   The departure of Mr. Casey, however, is a blow to Apple,
whose research and development organization is still reeling
from the ouster early this year of Jean-Louis Gassee. Since
then, John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer, has been
overseeing the company's research and development activities.
Mr. Casey directly reported to Mr. Sculley and recently was
handed responsibility for producing new products for the
company's Apple II family as well as networking products.
   Mr. Casey, 44 years old, said that the Lotus job "is a
great opportunity." He said he wasn't leaving Apple in a
dispute over strategy, but declined to comment on Apple's
outlook.
   Mr. Casey succeeds Frank Ingari who becomes vice president
of the new Emerging Markets Business Group, which will seek
markets in the home and small businesses. June Rokoff, vice
president of graphics products will become vice president of
a new group in charge of communications and information
services, including its CD-Rom products. David Roux who had
headed some of those operations becomes vice president of
business development.
