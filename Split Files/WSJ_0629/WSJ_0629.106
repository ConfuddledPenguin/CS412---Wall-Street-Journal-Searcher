   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed to resolve
important questions involving the jurisdiction of federal
bankruptcy courts.
   Most significantly, the justices agreed to decide whether
federal bankruptcy judges may conduct jury trials -- when
they are legally required -- on issues arising in bankruptcy
cases, or whether such cases may be handled only by federal
district judges.

   In such cases, the right to a jury trial may arise from
the type of dispute, not directly from the bankruptcy filing.
Many state and federal laws, as well as the Seventh Amendment
to the Constitution, guarantee defendants a jury trial in
certain types of civil cases.
   Civil jury trials in federal court are generally conducted
by federal district judges, who are appointed by the
president and confirmed by the Senate and who have life
tenure. Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the federal
appeals courts to 14-year terms. Neither Congress, in
revising federal bankruptcy law, nor the Supreme Court, in
interpreting the law, nor the Constitution has settled the
question of whether bankruptcy judges may conduct jury trials
when the disputes arise from bankruptcy cases.
   The question of the authority of bankruptcy courts to
conduct jury trials has divided the federal appeals courts
and created uncertainty in bankruptcy cases.
   It is an issue that has important practical implications.
Bankruptcy lawyers who favor jury trials in bankruptcy courts
say they are desirable because such disputes often involve
the transfer of a company's assets that needs quick
resolution. Forcing these disputes to federal district courts
could involve long delays, they say. Some lawyers argue
against bankruptcy court jury trials, fearing that bankruptcy
judges will become overloaded with such cases and because
district judges have more experience with juries.
   The justices agreed to resolve another bankruptcy issue in
the same case. They will decide whether a dispute about
insurance coverage for the assets of a company in Chapter 11
reorganization is a "core" issue over which the bankruptcy
court has jurisdiction, or whether it is a "non-core" issue
and should be decided by a federal district court or a state
court.
   The case is a dispute between Ben Cooper Inc., a toy and
costume manufacturer that filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code in April 1988, and Insurance
Company of the State of Pennsylvania, a unit of American
International Group Inc., which insured Cooper after the
Chapter 11 filing. The dispute is over an insurance claim by
Cooper for damage caused by a fire at one of its factories in
Georgia.
   A federal appeals court in New York ruled in February that
the insurance dispute directly affected the company's
reorganization status because the insurance coverage was
begun after the Chapter 11 filing. The appeals court said,
therefore, that the dispute was within the bankruptcy court's
"core" jurisdiction. And because such insurance fights are
normally subject to jury trials in federal court, the appeals
court said, the bankruptcy court should conduct the jury
trial.
   The high court agreed to hear the insurance company's
appeal in the next court term, which begins Oct. 1. The
announcement that the court would hear the case was contained
on a list released yesterday; the justices technically began
their summer recess Wednesday. (Insurance Co. of the State of
Pennsylvania vs. Ben Cooper Inc.)
                                                                                                       

   West Virginia Taxes
                                                                                                       

   The justices, in two unsigned orders, ruled that courts in
West Virginia improperly refused to apply retroactively a
ruling that the state's corporate taxes are unconstitutional.
The ruling will force the state to drop efforts to collect
back assessments against some companies and may require
refunds to others.
   Without hearing oral arguments, the justices ruled in
favor of Ashland Oil Inc. and National Mines Corp., a
National Steel Corp. unit. In one case, West Virginia
assessed a back levy of its business and occupation tax
against National Mines totaling $475,345 for wholesale sales
of coal mined in other states. In the other case, the state
assessed a deficiency of $181,313 against Ashland for taxes
on wholesale oil sales in West Virginia.
   In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia's
corporate taxes were unconstitutional because they favored
companies based in the state. But the West Virginia Supreme
Court of Appeals has said that the high court's decision
isn't retroactive and doesn't apply to taxes owed prior to
1984.
   The Supreme Court said that on the basis of two rulings it
issued in other tax cases, West Virginia must consider the
taxes unconstitutional retroactively. (National Mines Corp.
vs. Caryl; Ashland Oil Inc. vs. Caryl)
