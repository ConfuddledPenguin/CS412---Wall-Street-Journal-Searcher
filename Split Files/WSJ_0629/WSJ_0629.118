   NEW YORK -- Topps Co., which sells trading cards, flipped
a lawsuit at the National Football League, charging restraint
of trade.
   The suit in federal court by the Brooklyn-based company
accused the league of an "unlawful attempt to block Topps"
from selling its 1990 series of professional football player
cards. The suit alleges that the league and NFL Properties
Inc., its licensing arm, seek "to eliminate Topps as a
competitor to Pro Set Inc."

   Dallas-based Pro Set, also licensed by the NFL and NFL
Properties, introduced its first cards under the trademark
"NFL Pro Set" and "The Official NFL Card" prior to the 1989
season, and according to Topps, "were the top-selling
football cards in 1989."
   Topps's suit charges that the NFL, its teams and licensing
arm conspired to restrain competition in the football-card
market. The suit charges the NFL with trying to monopolize
the market, in violation of U.S. and state antitrust laws.
   The Topps suit "lacks any merit," said John Flood,
executive vice president and general counsel for NFL
Properties, which is also a defendant. Topps officials
declined to comment.
   Topps asked the court to rule in a so-called declaratory
judgment that its 1990 football cards, which are licensed by
the NFL Players' Association, do not infringe upon any
trademark rights of the NFL or its member clubs.
