   There are vast numbers of adults with at least a
bachelor's degree who want to teach. Many have advanced
degrees and years of successful experience in other careers.
But instead of capitalizing on this opportunity, we are on
the verge of blowing it.
   The obstacles to the highly educated getting into the
classroom are enormous. Leading the list of roadblocks is the
issue of teacher licensing or certification. Each state sets
certification requirements, and in all but Wyoming the
regular route is completion of an approved college teacher
education program. That means one has to go to college and
complete a series of education courses approved by the state
department of education.

   States in recent years -- due to political pressures, in
most cases -- have been creating "alternatives" to this
traditional route. It's a notion given strong support by
President Bush and the governors. But relatively few of these
programs are available to the large numbers of people who
would like to go through them.
   According to a study just completed by the National Center
for Education Information, which I head, 33 states now say
they have implemented alternative teacher certification
programs, and NCEI's analysis of these programs indicates
there are some very good ones out there for people who
already have completed at least a bachelor's degree and want
to enter a teacher preparation program and obtain a license.
These programs require a commitment from the state, the local
school district and usually from a cooperating college to
provide professional education training, mentoring or some
other type of beginning-teacher support -- components that
researchers say are important for successful teaching and
that most traditional teacher education programs do not
provide.
   Unfortunately, one-third of the states that report having
alternative programs tied them to teacher shortages. Since
teacher shortages have been few and far between, despite dire
predictions to the contrary, these programs have produced
very few teachers.
   Examples include Arkansas, which has certified only 21
teachers through its alternative route; Oklahoma, six;
Oregon, three; and Hawaii, 72. Arizona has a program for
secondary teachers that only three people have gone through.
New Jersey, which has gotten most of the publicity for
alternative certification, has had more than 7,000 applicants
for the program but has certified about 1,500. Only about
12,000 teachers in the entire nation have been certified
through alternative routes since 1985. That's about 0.5% of
the 2.4 million teachers now working in elementary and
secondary schools and only about 1% of new hires in the past
five years.
   Alternative teacher certification programs are not wanting
for detractors. Opponents call them "scab programs" and
"short cuts" -- implying that they produce less than
qualified teachers. However, there is not a shred of evidence
to support the contention, nor is there evidence that a
person who completes a traditional teacher education program
is truly qualified to teach.
   There are some studies making their way into the light of
day that show that there really is no difference in the
competence of beginning teachers who have come through
alternative routes and those who have gone through a
traditional program. California even has a study that shows
that emergency certified teachers, who are forced to sink or
swim, perform about the same as those who have gone through
both the alternative route and the traditional route.
   A Texas study shows that it's a dead heat between
beginning teachers who have gone through an alternative route
and those who completed traditional programs, and that the
edge in teaching skill goes to teachers with experience.
Preliminary results of an NCEI survey still in progress
indicate that teachers themselves say the biggest contributor
to their developing competence in the classroom is their own
experience, followed by working closely with other teachers.
   It is not surprising that the nation's some 1,300 schools,
colleges and departments of education are opposed to
state-designed alternative teacher certification programs and
hold fast to the belief that a person is fully qualified to
teach only after going through one of their programs --
preferably one of the ones that take the longest.
   Many in state departments of education that set
requirements for teacher certification are not enthusiastic
about alternative certification either. Several state
officials told us in our recent study, which promised
anonymity, that the only reason they had designed a program
was because of political pressure. One state person
explained, "If we hadn't designed this program, the state
legislature would have, and we didn't want that to happen."
Another noted that her state department wasn't sure any
college was going to submit a proposal for the program and
"definitely the school districts aren't enthusiastic about
it."
   Alternative certification programs mean work for all these
parties. It's much easier to go on with business as usual,
never mind that the demographic composition of this nation is
dramatically different than it was when the college approved
programs for educating and licensing teachers were designed.
   This issue needs to be viewed from a different perspective
for a simple reason: The pool of potential teachers is a new
one. It is older and highly educated.
   In 1970, there were four million more children of school
age than there were adults between 25 and 44 years old. Today
there are 34 million more adults in that age group than there
are children of school age. In addition, in 1970, one in 10
of the 110 million Americans 25 and older had at least a
bachelor's degree. Today one in five of the 150 million do.
Many of these educated adults want to help young people
develop. They want to bring their real life experiences into
the classroom. They want to help improve America's
educational system. They want to teach.
   Since last week, after an article about our study of
alternative teacher certification appeared in the New York
Times, we've gotten scores of phone calls from people who
want to know where the alternative certification programs are
-- they included a dentist who wants to teach biology, an
international businessman with a master's degree in physics
who wants to teach high school physics and math, and a
corporate executive who wants to teach elementary school.
   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, when it made its
Workforce 2000 projections, stated: "Considerable attention
has been focused on a potential shortage of workers. Often
this reflects not an overall lack of workers, but the
declining numbers in the younger age groups in the labor
force. This has caused employers to turn their attention to
alternative sources of workers." It's time to turn to other
sources of teachers.
   The U.S. faces some serious problems, but finding enough
intelligent and eager adults to teach its children is not one
of them. It is time to open up alternative means of entering
the teaching profession.
