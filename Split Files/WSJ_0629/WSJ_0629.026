   WASHINGTON -- During the 1980s, when the savings-and-loan
crisis festered and finally exploded, S&amp;L interests
contributed more than $11 million to congressional
candidates.
   According to an analysis of Federal Election Commission
records by Common Cause, the top recipient of political
contributions from S&amp;L executives, their families and
political action committees associated with thrift
institutions was Sen. Pete Wilson (R., Calif.), who took in
$243,334 from 1981-1990.

   Also ranking in the top five are three senators -- Donald
Riegle (D., Mich.); Alan Cranston (D., Calif.); and Alfonse
D'Amato (R., N.Y.) -- who face ethics investigations into
their ties to campaign contributors, including those in the
S&amp;L industry.
   The release of the study comes amid a bitterly partisan
political debate over who is to blame for the S&amp;L crisis. The
executive committee of the Democratic National Committee,
meeting in Portland, Ore., is expected to pass a resolution
tomorrow demanding that President Bush clean up "the
Republican-managed S&amp;L mess." Republicans, meanwhile, are
encouraging their party's congressional candidates to use the
S&amp;L issue to attack Democratic incumbents for mishandling
thrift legislation.
   PACs for the financial-services industry, which includes
S&amp;Ls, have been the largest corporate contributors to
congressional campaigns in recent years. In 1983-1990,
financial-services PACs gave nearly $22 million to candidates
for Congress.
   Common Cause is using the S&amp;L issue to pressure lawmakers
into passing legislation to overhaul campaign financing.
"We've had a $300 billion scandal and no one has done
anything to reform the corrupt system that let it happen,"
said Fred Wertheimer, president of the self-styled citizens
lobby. During the July 4 congressional recess, Common Cause
will unveil S&amp;L-focused newspaper advertisements criticizing
specific lawmakers in eight states and a dozen congressional
districts.
   Congressional Democrats, who control both chambers,
received a larger portion of the S&amp;L campaign bounty,
according to the Common Cause study. Among the top 25
recipients of S&amp;L-related contributions in the Senate and
House, Democrats took in $1.8 million while Republicans
received $1.4 million.
   The study also shows that President Bush's 1988 campaign
benefited from $600,000 in "soft money" (large contributions
from wealthy individuals to political parties that are made
outside of the federal election law limits) from executives
in the S&amp;L industry. That includes $100,000 from Charles
Keating, who is chairman of the former parent of Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., a
once-highflying thrift now in federal receivership.
   Several failed or deeply troubled thrifts were among the
biggest sources of campaign contributions, including Lincoln;
Western Savings &amp; Loan Association, Phoenix, Ariz., and
Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association, Dallas, whose former owner
was indicted this month.
   The leading individual contributor among S&amp;L interests was
Carl Lindner Jr., whose Ohio family contributed $828,920 to
congressional candidates. The Lindner family founded and
controls American Financial Corp., which owns Hunter Savings
Association. Mr. Lindner and Mr. Keating were once business
associates.
   The top recipients of S&amp;L-related contributions from
January 1981 through April 1990 were: Sen. Wilson, $243,334;
Sen. Riegle, $200,900; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas),
$154,207; Sen. Cranston, $143,700; and Sen. D'Amato, $88,235.
