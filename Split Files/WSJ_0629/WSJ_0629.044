   NEW YORK -- Chariot Group Inc. said it asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission to delist its common
shares from the American Stock Exchange because of limited
activity.
   The company, a producer of aluminum windows and doors,
said the exchange advised it that the last day the stock will
be traded is July 13. Chariot is also the largest shareholder
in Synalloy Corp., a South Carolina stainless-tube and
specialty-chemical maker.
