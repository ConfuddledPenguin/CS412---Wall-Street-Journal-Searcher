   BASF AG, a West German chemical company, said its
world-wide first-half sales decreased an indicated 4% from a
year earlier to 23.6 billion marks ($14.18 billion), marking
the first decline for that period since 1987, when sales fell
6%.
   In the 1989 first half, BASF sales rose 13% to 24.46
billion marks.

   BASF and other West German chemical makers' earnings and
sales have been hurt this year by the negative effect of the
strong mark against other currencies. Some of the company's
product sectors also have been under downward price pressure
because of fierce market competition. BASF's first-quarter
sales were little changed at 11.89 billion marks, compared
with a year earlier, but pretax profit slid 6.6% to 845
million marks.
   Chairman Hans Albers, in prepared remarks for the annual
meeting, nonetheless reiterated he is confident BASF will
come close to matching last year's earnings. In 1989, BASF
profit rose 43% to 2.02 billion marks from 1988, and pretax
profit was up 18% at 4.39 billion marks.
