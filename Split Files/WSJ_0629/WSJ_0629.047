   MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Federal Express Corp. said average daily
volume of packages and documents increased 11.5% in May,
before a one-time change in reporting procedures, to 1.3
million units. Total monthly volume, before the reporting
change, increased 11.5% to 28.4 million units.
   With the reporting change, which includes the company's
non-U.S. subsidiaries' volumes for April and May, instead of
just April as in the year-ago volume report, Federal
Express's average daily volume increased 11.9%.
