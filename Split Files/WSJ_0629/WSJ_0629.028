   ELGIN, Ill. -- Safety-Kleen Corp. said it is building a
$40 million oil re-refinery in East Chicago, Ind., which will

oil annually.
   The maker of parts-cleaner services and solvent recycling
said the plant, to be completed by May 1991, will produce 43
million gallons of high-quality base lubricating oil, as well
