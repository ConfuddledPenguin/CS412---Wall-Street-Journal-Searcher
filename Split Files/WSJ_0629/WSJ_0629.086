   WASHINGTON -- The House Public Works and Transportation
Committee approved legislation that would permit airports to
impose departure taxes to fund airport-expansion projects.
   The taxes, officially called passenger facility charges,
currently are banned by federal law. Under legislation
authored by Rep. James Oberstar (D., Minn.), chairman of the
House Aviation Subcommittee, the 71 biggest airports in the
U.S. would be permitted to impose fees of as much as $3 per
flight. For a one-way trip, a traveler would have to pay no
more than $6, regardless of how many airports were involved.

   The legislation, which also authorizes $17.7 billion for
airport construction and air traffic-control modernization in
the next two years, now goes to the House floor.
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said yesterday's vote
in repealing the departure-tax ban was an important step in
dealing "with our serious congestion problem." The
legislation was approved 36-10.
   The outlook is uncertain in the Senate, where Democrat
Wendell Ford of Kentucky, chairman of the Senate Aviation
Subcommittee, opposes the tax. He believes that the $7
billion surplus in the federal government's aviation trust
fund should be spent before passengers are compelled to pay
additional fees, an aide said.
   In a related development, the House panel approved
legislation requiring special inspections for aging aircraft.
