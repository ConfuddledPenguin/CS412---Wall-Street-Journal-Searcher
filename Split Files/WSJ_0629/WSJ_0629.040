   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Nike Inc. forecast better-than-expected
fourth-quarter and year-end profits, sending its stock
soaring. The stock closed at $77.50, up $4.25 in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, with about 1.3 million
shares changing hands.
   Nike credited a combination of favorable accounting and
tax changes for the boost in profits, which will exceed Wall
Street's expectations.

   Philip Knight, chairman of the athletic shoe company, said
profit in the fourth quarter ended May 31 will be in the
range of $64 million to $66 million, or $1.70 to $1.75 a
share, exceeding analysts' estimates of $1.50 to $1.60 a
share. In last year's fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31,
1989, the company posted profit of $36.5 million, or 97 cents
a share.
   For the year ended May 31, the company expects to report
profit of $240 million to $242 million, or $6.35 to $6.40 a
share, exceeding Wall Street estimates of about $6.15 to
$6.25 a share. In fiscal 1989, profit was $167 million, or
$4.45 a share.
   The unexpectedly strong profits stem from a favorable
revision in the company's last-in, first-out inventory
reserves, and a lower-than-anticipated tax rate.
   Nike said it plans to announce complete fourth quarter and
year-end results July 9 at an analysts' meeting in New York.
