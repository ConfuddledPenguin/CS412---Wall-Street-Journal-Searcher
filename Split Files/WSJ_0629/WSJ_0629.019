   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Polaroid Corp. has a new way of
selling more of its instant cameras: put Minolta's name on
them.
   Polaroid agreed to let the Japanese company sell the
Spectra Pro, Polaroid's most expensive consumer instant
camera, in the U.S. as the Minolta Instant Pro starting late
this summer.

   For Polaroid, which long has boasted that it has one of
the world's best-known brand names, making products for rival
Minolta Camera Co. is a highly unusual marketing move
reflecting the company's general woes. Sales of instant
cameras have been sluggish for much of the past decade, as
35mm cameras sold by Minolta and others have overwhelmed the
instant market. As a result, Polaroid is looking for new ways
to get more cameras in the hands of photographers so it can
sell more film, its most profitable product.
   "It translates to the public that somehow the Polaroid
name doesn't have the value anymore," said Stephen A.
Greyser, professor of marketing at Harvard Business School.
"And, in terms of selling one's highest-end product -- the
one you spent the {research and development} money producing
-- under a competitor's name, it is very peculiar."
   Polaroid contended that agreement with Minolta is a
logical move. "We're trying to find new ways to grow our
business by putting another camera on the market that, with
Minolta's good name, would lend a positive brand
identification to instant photography," said Lee C. Brewer,
vice president of Polaroid's world-wide sales group. "This is
absolutely not a white flag."
   Minolta won't be selling Polaroid's regular Spectra camera
or its lower priced Impulse, which account for the bulk of
Polaroid's camera sales.
   Analysts agreed that the move was somewhere between
pragmatic and creative, allowing Polaroid to take advantage
of Minolta's superior marketing force in specialty camera
stores. Ultimately, Polaroid will sell more Spectra film,
because the agreement doesn't permit Minolta to sell instant
film for the cameras.
   The move is a truce, "a friendship flag saying, `We need a
little help from our Japanese friends,'" said Brenda Lee
Landry, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "Polaroid is
desperate for some new growth. And, remember, these high-end
cameras really burn film. Sure, you've got to sell your
cameras, but the money is in film."
   All of which offers Polaroid some solace. The company's
instant camera sales peaked at 9.4 million in 1978, says Ms.
Landry, as compared with about 3 million cameras sold in
1989. Meanwhile, she says, the amount of film sold dropped
only slightly over the decade, with Polaroid expanding into
the industrial and medical markets.
   Overall, the company's sales have been disappointing of
late. First-quarter sales slipped 1.4% to $436.2 million.
That followed a meager 2.2% increase in sales last year to
$1.90 billion.
   Polaroid's main problem, said Eugene Glazer, an analyst
for Dean Witter Reynolds, is that instant photographs cost
twice as much per print as conventional film. The Minolta
Instant Pro, however, will be aimed at buyers such as
insurance adjusters, real estate agents and architects, who
need instant prints and care less about cost. He said that
the arrangement, albeit somewhat peculiar, shows Polaroid is
being "more open-minded, maybe more realistic about its
situation."
   In general, it is a well-known company that will sell,
under its brand name, the products of companies that don't
have names that are as strong. For instance, Polaroid sells
conventional film made for it by several lesser known
companies.
   But such agreements between major, high-profile
competitors are rare, says Harvard Business School's Prof.
Greyser. "The closest I can come is the Sears-Whirlpool
alliance" under which Whirlpool Corp. makes appliances that
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. sells under the Kenmore brand name. But
that is different, he says, in part because Whirlpool sells
its low-end models to Sears, not its more expensive models
with the latest features.
   Still, Polaroid said the agreement may be just the
beginning of its relationship with Minolta. It is "a first
step to explore a potential long-term collaboration between
our two companies," said Polaroid President and Chief
Executive Officer I. MacAllister Booth.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Polaroid's stock rose, closing at $40.625 a share, up 87.5
cents.
