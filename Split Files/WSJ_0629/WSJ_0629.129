   NEW YORK -- Ampal-American Israel Corp. said its principal
shareholder, Bank Hapoalim B.M., has offered to acquire the
industrial loan portfolios of Ampal's three banking
subsidiaries in Israel.
   Under terms of the offer, Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest
commercial bank, would acquire the loan portfolios for $875
million, their book value at Dec. 31. The bank would pay $53
million in cash, all of which would be deposited at Bank
Hapoalim and used over the next 15 years to pay off
Ampal-American debentures.

   The bank also would assume $822 million in liabilities.
About $547 million of those liabilities are Bank Hapoalim
funds deposited at the Ampal-American units.
   The banking units of Ampal-American, which also has
interests in Israeli industrial and agricultural projects,
real estate, hotels and tourism, stopped making new loans in
1989. It said it could not compete with the rates of domestic
Israeli lenders, which have benefited from changes in Israeli
banking and currency regulations.
   The sale of the units would "eliminate a lot of
uncertainty for us," says Lawrence Lefkowitz,
Ampal-American's secretary.
   The offer, which expires Aug. 15, must be approved by
committees made up of Ampal directors unaffiliated with Bank
Hapoalim. Three of Bank Hapoalim's officers sit on
Ampal-American's board. Ampal-American's president and chief
executive, Michael Arnon, until April 1990 was a co-chairman
of a Bank Hapoalim subsidiary. The bank owns 34% of
Ampal-American's Class A stock and 87% of its common stock.
The company's common is not publicly traded.
