   WASHINGTON -- The House approved an $83.6 billion
appropriations bill that would increase spending for major
domestic and science programs by $12.3 billion in fiscal 1991
and restructure President Bush's space budget by cutting
funds for exploration of Mars.
   The final 355-48 roll call came after the chamber rejected
successive efforts to pare back costs across-the-board.
Despite Bush administration protests at the increased
spending, 46 Republicans joined the Appropriations Committee
leadership in rejecting a 2% cut by a 235-172 margin.

   Veterans, housing, and environmental programs account for
the bulk of the domestic spending increases, but the measure
taps into a cross-section of liberal and conservative
interests because of the public investment in space and
science.
   National Science Foundation research funding would grow
almost 9% to $1.85 billion, while almost $14.3 billion is
allocated to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, a 17% increase from the current year and
almost two-thirds more than was spent in fiscal 1988.
   However large, the proposed NASA budget is $828.8 million
less than the administration's request, and more than $300
million associated with the president's Moon and Mars
initiative would be eliminated entirely. Funding for the
space station and high-speed space plane is preserved --
though below the administration request -- and the House
endorsed a pattern of more generous funding for the ambitious
Earth-observing system, or EOS, to study climate and
atmospheric ozone.
   An estimated $108 million in new funding would be provided
for the EOS instrument program, and another $35 million is
allocated to the continuing total ozone mapping spectrometer,
whose principal contractor is Beckman Instruments Inc. in
California.
   The emphasis on the EOS reflects the priorities of New
York Rep. Bill Green, the longtime ranking Republican on the
appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA. But a second
factor helping the EOS is that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
at the California Institute of Technology stands to benefit
from the House decision to add $10 million for work on
synthetic aperture radar. That radar is to measure terrain
and give a more complete picture of global temperature
changes.
   Amid the new money for NASA, little was said of the
discovery this week of flaws in the Hubble Space Telescope,
but the history of the multibillion-dollar instrument is sure
to haunt the administration's efforts to resurrect its Mars
initiative.
   As the senior Republican on the committee, Mr. Green has
stressed NASA's immediate priorities of addressing problems
in the ongoing shuttle and space station programs, and
younger conservatives were frustrated in their efforts to
focus attention on what they see as a high-profile initiative
to give an orientation to their party in the future.
   "I think it's in real trouble," Rep. Robert Walker, the
GOP deputy whip and a member of the House Science, Space, and
Technology Committee, said of the Mars initiative. "We could
very well end up with nothing."
   The Pennsylvania conservative blamed NASA for not
supporting the Mars project more aggressively, but he watched
with evident dismay as members of his own party ridiculed and
killed a relatively modest $6 million appropriation to
continue a decade-long program using radio telescopes to
listen for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.
   The administration had sought more than $12 million for
the project, which involves the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto
Rico as well as a network of telescopes around the world.
These ambitious plans may well have been its undoing, as more
members saw a vulnerable target to make themselves look tough
on spending.
   The net spending increase of $12.3 billion in the bill
understates the true growth in discretionary appropriations
for the same accounts, but almost half of these funds can be
attributed to required adjustments in existing housing
programs. Thousands of 15-year leases under the so-called
Section 8 housing program for low-income families are coming
due in the next few years, and though the annual expenditures
won't change so drastically, huge appropriations are required
up front to simply renew the existing contracts with
landlords.
