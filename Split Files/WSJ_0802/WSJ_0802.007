   SEATTLE -- The Cold War may be history, but that hasn't
eased the tension for about 1,400 hard-smoking Soviets
billeted here for the 17-day Goodwill Games.
   What has the Soviets fuming is Seattle's aggressive
no-smoking policy. Only 22% of Seattlites smoke -- the U.S.
average is 29% -- and the pristine city boasts one of the
nation's toughest anti-smoking laws. Not so in Moscow, where
nearly half of all residents regularly light up, or in Baku,
where the smoker average flares to 65%.

   With that kind of cultural disparity, finding a place to
puff in peace can be tough here. A manual issued by Goodwill
Games officials to Seattlites playing host to Soviets warns
the locals to be prepared for their visitors' smoking habits.
   "Provide a place for them to smoke," the directive
suggests. "Soviets will understand if that place is outside."
   But banishing Soviet smokers to the back yard can be
tricky. "We've had hosts haul their visitors down here
begging us to explain they can't smoke in the house," says
Pamela Rice, an interpreter at the Pepsi Friendship Center,
an international gathering ground set up for Soviets in
downtown Seattle.
   Vladimir Geskin, a deputy editor of the Moscow newspaper
Sovietski Sport, complained about Seattle's hard-nosed
attitude toward smoking in a front-page byline article in the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer this week. Mr. Geskin wailed that
even the Games press center is off-limits for smokers. "That
is a neutral international territory," he said. "Not to let
me smoke violates my human rights."
   Steven Smith, a Games housing coordinator, says one Soviet
visitor called the Goodwill hot line begging to be
transferred to a house where he could smoke. "He said, `I
want to smoke and I want to drink. This rich yuppie has too
many rules.'" After a search, the unhappy Soviet was shifted
to a more amenable residence. "He called back and said, `We
are smokers. We are brothers,'" Mr. Smith says.
   At a residence hall set up for actors from the Sovremennik
Theater of Moscow, a nervous house manager called a fire
drill after most of the troupe lit up after dinner.
   Robert Rosner, a director of the Goodwill housing program,
says Soviet officials failed to include information about
their countrymen's smoking habits. When Goodwill officials
surveyed the concerns of potential hosts, Mr. Rosner says,
"Smoking came in ahead of `What do I do if they want to
defect.'"
