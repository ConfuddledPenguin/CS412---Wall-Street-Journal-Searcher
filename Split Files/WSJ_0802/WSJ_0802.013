   Political scientists long have assumed that politicians
behave as they do to increase their chances of being
re-elected. But officials of powerful agencies, such as the
Federal Reserve System, don't have to run for election.
Robert Auerbach, a former congressional and Treasury
economist who now teaches at the University of California,
Riverside, suggests agency officials have another motive: to
increase the power of their agencies.
   In a paper presented at the recent Western Economic
Association meeting in San Diego, Prof. Auerbach focuses
mainly on the Fed, and it's true that no other agency offers
so many examples of action dictated by power-preservation.
But it should be noted, right off the bat, that acting to
preserve or to enhance power doesn't necessarily mean acting
against the public's interest. The Fed was created by an act
of Congress. If it is perceived to be working mainly to build
its power, it can be reformed or even abolished at any time.

   The Fed has to play to a variety of audiences. For several
weeks the Bush administration has been pressing the Federal
Reserve to lower the federal funds rate, arguing that lower
interest rates are needed to keep the sluggish business
expansion alive. But inflation has been stubbornly refusing
to diminish, and the Fed has been fearful that the markets
would see lower interest rates as a sign that the central
bank has given up the fight against rising prices.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's July performances were, to
say the least, agile. He wanted to reduce the fed funds rate,
the fee charged on very short-term loans of bank reserves,
but he didn't want to make a big thing out of it. So he made
the announcement a few days before the semiannual monetary
hearings in Congress, hoping that the action would seem
somewhat less significant.
   And why was the funds rate being cut? Not because the Fed
saw an imminent recession or a real credit crunch. It was
just that bank credit policies and capital requirements
appear to be causing an unintended tightening of bank credit
conditions. The lowering of the funds rate, Mr. Greenspan
emphasized, did not represent any lessening of the Fed's
determination to fight inflation.
   Unfortunately, the argument didn't fly. Administration
officials and others who wanted lower interest rates to spur
the economy complained that the action was too little and too
late. The bond market and others concerned about growing
signs of inflation thought the Fed had, indeed, abandoned its
anti-inflation principles. So late in the month, before the
House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan was arguing that he
was, too, fighting inflation. He cited the fact that various
versions of the money supply (which the Fed hasn't mentioned
much recently) were hardly growing at all. That, of course,
only increased the worries of the part of the central bank's
audience that thinks the Fed is trying to push the economy
over the edge of a cliff.
   The recent developments help to illustrate why the Fed's
power-preservation program has usually included an effort to
keep its business, as much as possible, to itself. If the
public doesn't know what the Federal Reserve is trying to do,
it's difficult to say that the effort has been a failure.
Chairman Greenspan, in fact, has been criticized by some Fed
followers for what they see as his "open mouth" policy.
   Prof. Auerbach has collected some samples from the past to
show the central bank's usual preference for secrecy. In
1974, for instance, Wright Patman, then the chairman of the
House Banking Committee, asked the Fed for salary data for
employees of the Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks
earning $20,000 or more a year, together with the salaries
they were receiving three years earlier.
   Mr. Patman, it should be stressed, was always concerned
about how the Fed was spending money; he once became quite
disturbed when he learned how much a regional bank was
spending on table-tennis balls. But he was an official of
Congress and the Fed is a creature of Congress, so Chairman
Arthur Burns had to reply.
   Mr. Burns said he would of course supply the information,
but he urged Mr. Patman to keep it to himself. "In recent
years," he wrote, "there have been numerous unfortunate
incidents, such as kidnappings and robberies, perpetrated on
individuals in the United States. To minimize such risks to
Federal Reserve officials, the names of individual employees
in the categories you mentioned should, I feel, be held in
confidence." This effort must have succeeded; at any rate,
there is no record that any $20,000-a-year clerks
subsequently were kidnapped.
   In the Federal Reserve's campaign to keep things to
itself, an occasional obstacle has been the General
Accounting Office, a highly regarded agency that, when
requested, looks into goings-on around the government. In the
early 1970s Congress was considering a bill that would have
authorized the GAO to audit Fed records. The Board of
Governors persuaded officials of regional banks to lobby,
evidently successfully, against the legislation.
   If the Fed is to be audited, the Fed would rather do it
itself. In 1979, just after the central bank had announced
its intention to pay more attention to monetary aggregates,
it reported a sudden sharp rise in the aggregates that
actually hadn't occurred. The House Banking Committee asked
the Fed to investigate to learn whether any employee had
profited from the error.
   The Federal Reserve could have asked Congress to call in
the GAO, but instead it hired a private law firm, which hired
a private accounting firm. The bill came to $877,675.88. The
Fed received a clean bill of health except for brief mention
of possible insider trading by a Fed employee.
   The recent experiences should, but probably won't,
encourage the Federal Reserve to launch its own version of
glasnost. If the public doesn't know what you're doing, it's
true that it's harder to blame you for failures. But in an
atmosphere of mystery the suspicion may eventually develop
that you're up to no good.
