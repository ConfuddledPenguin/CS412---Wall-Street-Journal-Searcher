   WASHINGTON -- President Bush, risking a partisan firefight
that could destroy the chances for a budget compromise this
fall, is threatening to step up his attacks on the Democrats.
   Although Mr. Bush himself said nothing publicly yesterday,
he told congressional Republicans he is prepared to alter his
tactics and criticize Democrats for standing in the way of a
budget compromise.

   "Brother, he's got fire in his belly," said House
Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois. The president is
"certainly not going to keep his trap shut all during
August."
   Although House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia
said he is advising Mr. Bush and his aides to realize "that
their opponents are not people of good will," other
Republican budget negotiators and administration officials
insist Mr. Bush hasn't given up on the bipartisan budget
summit yet.
   Instead, they say the administration has chosen to walk a
fine line: criticizing Democrats without being so harsh that
it becomes impossible to resume negotiations after the August
congressional recess. One senior GOP congressional aide
predicted Mr. Bush will temper his criticism if Democrats
agree this week to a firm timetable for reaching an agreement
in September. Negotiations for such a timetable are
continuing.
   Nevertheless, the prospect of a month of partisan attacks
and counterattacks led to more pessimism on Capitol Hill
about the chances of reaching an accord before
across-the-board spending cuts are triggered on Oct. 15.
   "It's going to make it very difficult to arrive at a
negotiated settlement if the administration deliberately
poisons the political atmosphere over the next few weeks,
which they seem intent on doing," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D.,
Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, senior Republican on that committee,
conceded: "The odds of us not being able to get it done are
increased over two weeks ago." But the New Mexico Republican
added: "I clearly believe it's doable in September."
   "I think the first half of the summit has collapsed," Rep.
Gingrich said outside the White House yesterday, adding: "I
think the president is committed to trying to resurrect it in
September."
   The only way to avoid triggering the deep spending cuts
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will be to
alter the law, an option the administration says it will
veto, or to wrap up a compromise immediately after Labor Day
and rush it through Congress -- which remains a possibility.
   "I'm quite optimistic when we get back here (from the
August break) you'll see a serious exchange of offers," said
Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee. Despite yesterday's rhetoric, negotiators are
still contemplating several days of intense talks in the
first week of September.
   Mr. Bush and his congressional allies have been backed
into a corner by the Democrats and by their own missteps.
President Bush in June said he was willing to raise taxes,
repudiating his campaign promise without extracting any
substantial concessions from Democrats. A month later, bitter
House Republicans demanded that the summit eschew any tax
increases. And then last week, widely reported leaks of a
draft Republican proposal painted the party as favoring
higher taxes on beer, wine and liquor, along with limits on
deductions for state and local income taxes.
   Almost immediately, some Republican negotiators began
disavowing parts of the plan. Now that Mr. Bush has elected
not to demand that Congress delay or cancel its August
recess, a course that some of his advisers suggested, the
only ammunition he has left is harsh rhetoric.
   Democrats, meanwhile, have kept their own substantial
internal divisions quiet and haven't endorsed any unpopular
proposals -- either in public or, much to the frustration of
the Republicans, at the closed-door budget summit. "By our
silence, we have been successful in the summit so far," said
Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   "The Republicans have just shot themselves in the foot, in
the neck, in the ear," he added. "They're masochists."
   Rep. Gingrich agrees. The summit has been like "watching
the Republicans punch themselves in the face," he said. So
far, the political costs have fallen on the Republicans. But
he added: "The political costs aren't over. It's like
measuring World War II right after Pearl Harbor."
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, spending cuts of about $85
billion -- or perhaps as much as $100 billion depending on
certain technical factors -- will be triggered on Oct. 15
unless Congress passes legislation bringing the
administration's deficit forecast below $110 billion before
then. By all accounts, the spending cuts would be so deep
that the federal government would have to lay off employees
and reduce services -- although it isn't completely clear how
quickly that would happen.
   While the budget negotiators have been bickering, Congress
has been proceeding with spending bills that would add to the
deficit rather than reduce it. Congressional Republicans said
Mr. Bush vowed to veto them yesterday. "When the spending
bills come to him which are in excess of what he has
proposed, he has made up his mind to issue the vetoes," said
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.).
