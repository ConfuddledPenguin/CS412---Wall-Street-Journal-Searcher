   MONTREAL -- Paul Desmarais Sr., a Canadian financier, and
Albert Frere of Belgium completed an agreement to pool their
combined controlling stakes in two big European holding
companies, Pargesa Holding S.A. and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert
S.A.
   Messrs. Desmarais and Frere, through companies they
control, together hold about 50% of Geneva-based Pargesa. Mr.
Frere holds about 8% of Brussels-based GBL, and Pargesa holds
37%.

   Under the agreement, Messrs. Desmarais and Frere will put
their Pargesa stakes into a new holding company and Mr.
Frere's GBL stake into a second new holding company. Each new
company will be equally owned by the two partners.
   An official at Power Financial Corp., a subsidiary of
Desmarais-controlled Power Corp. of Canada, said the
Desmarais and Frere groups will act together at Pargesa and
GBL, adopting common positions on matters such as board and
management representation, financing activities and purchases
and sales of assets.
   "It's essentially a joint venture," the Power Financial
official said. "We will achieve decisions by consensus."
   The agreement runs for 11 years and can be renewed for
five-year terms by mutual agreement. Each partner has a right
of first refusal to buy the other's interests in Pargesa or
GBL for five years after the termination of the agreement,
the Power Financial official said.
   Messrs. Desmarais and Frere said in February that they
held 50% of Pargesa and intended to work together closely.
   The Power Financial official said yesterday that the
partners "will be concentrating on what we see as our core
assets" at Pargesa and GBL. He wouldn't elaborate.
