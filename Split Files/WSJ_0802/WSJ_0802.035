   WASHINGTON -- Speaker Thomas Foley, in a strongly worded
statement to the full House, condemned the "terror tactics"
of the Irish Republican Army and "cowardly murder" of Ian
Gow, a British conservative killed this week by a bomb
planted in his car.
   "The clear and despicable purpose of this callous act was
intimidation through terror," said the Washington State
Democrat, who broke with custom by speaking from the well of
the House immediately after the chamber convened yesterday.
Surprised by the speaker's appearance, members sat in unusual
silence but then rose in applause at the conclusion of his
remarks.

   "The IRA's guns and bombs have not brought independence
for Northern Ireland, nor will they," said Mr. Foley, one of
the most prominent Irish-American officeholders in the U.S.
"What they have brought -- in the years since British troops
were sent to Northern Ireland in 1972 -- is the deaths of
many more civilian bystanders than of soldiers or policemen,
the deaths of many more Catholics than Protestants, in fact,
many more deaths than can be attributed to the British."
   A supporter of the 1985 Anglo-Irish accord giving the
Republic of Ireland a consultative role in the governing of
Northern Ireland, Mr. Foley has disagreed with Mr. Gow on a
number of Irish issues. But he was described as deeply
affected by the killing and the threat it posed to
Parliament.
