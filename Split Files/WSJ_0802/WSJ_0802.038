   DALLAS -- International Telecharge Inc. said a shareholder
filed a purported class-action suit in federal court here
against the company and its directors.
   The suit alleges that ITI made false and misleading
statements about its expectations for the second quarter
ended June 30. On July 19, ITI said it anticipated a
substantial net loss for the quarter, including a special
charge of $1.3 million for fraudulent billings.

   ITI said it had not seen the suit and declined to comment
on it. The company said it would defend its interests
vigorously.
   The suit is the latest in a series of legal blows to the
provider of operator services and pay telephones. American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. sued ITI last March, alleging that
ITI engaged in deceptive trade practices to win pay-phone
customers away from AT&amp;T. Last year, shareholders filed two
purported class-action lawsuits alleging securities
violations. Those three suits are still pending, ITI said.
