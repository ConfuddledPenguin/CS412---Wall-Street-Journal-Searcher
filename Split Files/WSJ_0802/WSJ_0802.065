   MADRID -- With his back to a portrait of Simon Bolivar,
the man who led Latin America's struggle for independence in
the early 1800s, Fernando Valenzuela reviews relations with
Spain's former New World colonies.
   "For the first time in its history," affirms Mr.
Valenzuela, the head of Spain's overseas-development agency,
"Spain can be of use to Latin America."

   And, he might well add, Latin America can be of use to
Spain.
   Nearly five centuries after Christopher Columbus, Spain is
rediscovering Latin America. But this time, it is seeking
partnership and cooperation rather than empire.
   In part, its aim is assisting Latin American development.
But there is a measure of self-interest as well. Spanish
firms are looking to the region for expansion. And Spanish
diplomats and officials are dreaming of an Ibero-American
community of nations.
   "If Spain has any area of influence and contacts, it's in
Latin America," says Pina Lopez Gay, the executive vice
chairman of Spain's commission for commemorating the 500th
anniversary of Columbus's arrival in America in 1492.
   "For any Spaniard," says Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu,
chairman of Telefonica de Espana S.A., "Latin America is the
prolongation of our own land. Our peoples have the same
language, the same culture. There are great opportunities for
us to do business together."
   However, despite such ties and the family links forged by
cross-migration, "there are a lot of misunderstandings on
both sides," says Pedro Shimose, a Bolivian writer who lives
in Madrid.
   Spain, though still "la madre patria", or mother country,
for many Latin Americans, is viewed by large numbers in the
region with mixed affection and contempt. Tales of the
cruelty of the Spanish conquistadors and of the Latin
American fight for independence still foster resentment. On
the Spanish side, years of post-colonial prejudice are summed
up in the word "sudaca", used dismissively by Spaniards to
refer to their South American cousins.
   "We have had a strange love-hate relationship," says
Emilio Cassinello, a former Spanish ambassador to Mexico.
"Perhaps it's because we haven't been able to digest past
history."
   As part of its drive for closer ties, Spain is offering
aid, trade and political cooperation to its former colonies.
And it has taken on a role as their advocate and protector in
relations with Western Europe. The bottom line, in both
cases, is Spain's search for a greater world role.
   There are signs that Spain is winning increased
international credibility because of its links with Latin
America. Though Spain was sharply critical of the U.S.
military intervention in Panama, U.S. officials say
Washington pays heed to Madrid's views on the region.
   In October and February, Spain was host for two rounds of
talks between Britain and Argentina that led them to mend
diplomatic relations torn by the 1982 war over the Falkland
Islands. Spain also provided facilities for talks -- albeit
inconclusive ones -- between warring factions in Guatemala.
   Spain's 1992 Columbus celebration is providing a major
impulse for its Ibero-American community plans. As part of
the buildup, Spain has launched a series of projects with
Latin America, including a multivolume history of
Ibero-America, the repair of historic monuments in Latin
America and a Spanish-language patent registry.
   Loosely modeled on Britain's Commonwealth and France's
ties with Francophone Africa, Spain's vision of an
Ibero-American community still lacks any institutional
framework.
   From his office on the outskirts of Madrid, Mr. Valenzuela
manages an aid budget of less than $100 million a year, more
than half of which goes to the poorest of Latin American
countries. Until the early 1980s, Spain was an aid recipient
itself. Now, its economy is booming and it can afford to
share its wealth.
   On the commercial front, while Spanish firms start with a
linguistic advantage, they face tough competition from other
countries. The U.S., West Germany, Italy and France all have
stronger commercial ties with the region.
   But many companies are hoping to change the situation.
"Until now, we haven't taken as much commercial advantage of
our links with Latin America as we should have," says
Telefonica's Mr. Velazquez-Gaztelu. In addition to buying
into the telephone systems of Chile and Argentina this year,
Telefonica is interested in Mexico, Venezuela and Puerto
Rico.
   Last month, the Spanish airline Iberia led a consortium
that was the sole bidder for a stake in Aerolineas
Argentinas, and Repsol, the Spanish state oil company, has
linked up with Petroleos Mexicanos.
