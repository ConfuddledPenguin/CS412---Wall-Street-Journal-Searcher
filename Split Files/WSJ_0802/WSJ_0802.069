   WASHINGTON -- The federal government's borrowing needs
continue to explode as a result of sluggish economic growth
and the cash demands of the savings-and-loan bailout.
   The Treasury Department reported that the government will
need to borrow a record $63.5 billion in the third quarter to
finance the general needs of the government as well as the
S&amp;L bailout.

   The government also said it will need to borrow $65
billion to $70 billion in the fourth quarter, excluding the
money needed to provide working capital for the thrift
bailout. The amount of working capital that will be needed in
the fourth quarter for the S&amp;L bailout isn't yet known, but
it could push total government borrowing over the $100
billion mark.
   To help fill this massive financing gap in the current
quarter, the Treasury said it plans to sell $32.5 billion of
notes and bonds this month to refund $20 billion of notes
maturing on Aug. 15 and to raise $12.25 billion in cash.
   The new securities will consist of:
   -- $11.5 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned next
Tuesday;
   -- $10.5 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned next
Wednesday;
   -- $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned next
Thursday.
   The three-year notes will mature on Aug. 15, 1993, the
10-year notes will mature Aug. 15, 2000, and the 30-year
bonds will mature Aug. 15, 2020.
   The Treasury noted that it may have to change its auction
schedule if Congress has not raised the limit on federal debt
by Aug. 6.
   The Treasury said it also will sell $10 billion of 36-day
cash management bills next Thursday.
   Including next week's refunding, the Treasury will have
raised $40.1 billion of its $63.5 billion borrowing needs.
The remaining $23.4 billion will be raised through the sale
of regular 13-week, 26-week, and 52-week bills, as well as a
two-year note in August and a five-year note in early
September. The department said it may be necessary to sell
additional cash management bills in September.
   The Treasury said the next auction of Refcorp bonds to
finance the S&amp;L bailout will be auctioned Oct. 9 and settled
Oct. 16.
