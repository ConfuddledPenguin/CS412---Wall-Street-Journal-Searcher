   NEW YORK -- "Prime Time Live" set out to change network
television. Instead, network television changed "Prime Time
Live."
   It all seemed so promising a year ago. That's when ABC
News's president and technological wizard, Roone Arledge,
formed a hot-shot team and conceived a dramatic new format to
take a stab at one of television's most elusive and coveted
products: a successful prime-time news program.

   The show would be anchored by ABC's biggest name
correspondent, Sam Donaldson, and the glamorous Diane Sawyer,
snatched away from rival CBS News for an annual salary of
$1.6 million.
   "Prime Time Live" would be like nothing ever seen on
television. Early ads for the program promised viewers that
their "world will never be the same." The show would air
entirely live, criss-crossing the globe from event to event,
with correspondents who would go through passports like
tissues.
   It would have a live studio audience, called upon to react
to the breaking events of the day. And it would feature
unscripted and topical repartee between Mr. Donaldson and Ms.
Sawyer. As part of the preshow hype, she described the
match-up as "a blind date between Emily Dickinson and the
Terminator."
   But the grandiose plans soon crashed head-on with a
reality of mediocre ratings, poor reviews and, ultimately,
diminished expectations. A year later, "Prime Time Live" is a
drastically altered show.
   Gone are the studio audience, the flurry of live reports
from far-flung places, the program-closing chit-chat between
"Sam &amp; Diane." They don't even sit side-by-side anymore: Mr.
Donaldson departed for Washington, D.C., in May. Also gone
are some of the most expensive technological toys in
television, including a $400,000 "vidwall," composed of 16
monitors stacked atop one another and used as a backdrop on
the show's set. Even the booming theme music, composed by
Bill Conti, who scored "Rocky," has been scrapped.
   "Prime Time Live" diverted from its grand designs because
of problems with conflicting visions, an overemphasis on
going live and poor on-air chemistry between the two stars.
   "The lesson we learned is when you're in prime time, you
can't take risks you can at other parts of the day," says
Joanna Bistany, the No. 2 executive at ABC News. "People just
have higher expectations."
   The show's executive producer, Rick Kaplan, agrees. "Some
of the live pieces were real sweet and would've looked great
on a local station's morning show," he says. "They just had
no place on prime time television."
   That is not to say that "Prime Time Live" has been a
disaster. Its ratings, while not in the blockbuster category,
have been respectable against tough competition and better
than those of the show it replaced (9.8% of the available
audience for the second quarter of this year, compared with
6.3% last year, when "Heartbeat" was carried in that slot).
For cost-conscious Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the program costs
less than an entertainment show -- an average of $400,000 per
episode, compared with $1 million for an hour-long drama --
and turns a modest profit.
   It has produced some fine segments, such as an
investigative report on the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. It
recently received six Emmy nominations. And ABC remains
exuberant about its future. "What the show is today is a
culmination of its past experience, and the show is better
off because of it," Ms. Bistany says.
   The first-anniversary show of "Prime Time Live" will be
broadcast tonight, and a revised format "will become clear in
the next few weeks," she says. The new format will probably
include two investigative stories or newsmaker interviews, a
story of an individual vs. the system and some kind of moving
feature -- much like any other network news magazine.
   That is a far cry from the hype. When Roone Arledge got
the go-ahead last year to supply a second prime-time hour to
complement "20/20," he envisioned a control room filled with
monitors, each one displaying a riveting event. The show
would jump from story to story.
   "The problem was there are few events going on Thursday
night at 10," recalls one person involved in early planning.
   Eight weeks before the show was to premiere, Mr. Arledge's
hand-picked producer, "Good Morning America" alum Phyllis
McGrady, quit suddenly because of a family illness. Mr.
Arledge hastily tapped Kaplan, the executive producer of
"Nightline," who just a few months earlier had told his staff
he wouldn't be leaving the show.
   That upset "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel -- who had
already lost several senior people to the program -- and
began a series of battles between "Prime Time Live" and
"Nightline" that ultimately led Mr. Koppel to fax a letter to
Mr. Kaplan severing their professional relationship.
   As the Aug. 3 premiere date approached, no stories were
ready to go on the air. The show wasn't even named. Among the
dozens of rejected titles were "Dateline," "Smoking Gun,"
"Prime Seat," "Scoop," "Day of Air" and, the staff's
favorite, "TV One," named after the ABC studio in Manhattan
where the show originated.
   "Nothing was in place eight weeks before we went on the
air," says Mr. Kaplan. "We didn't have one piece finished. We
didn't even have our head booker {who schedules guests}
hired. It was a prescription for failure. Absolute disaster."
   Despite a two-year commitment from the network, "Prime
Time Live" had a special problem: Key players had starkly
different visions of what the show would be. That was
aggravated by Mr. Arledge's style of not interfering with
executive producers. He let his multimillion-dollar project
drift. (Mr. Arledge would not comment for this article.)
   Mr. Donaldson, who thought the network wanted a show that
stressed live elements about breaking news, didn't prepare
any taped stories last summer. Ms. Sawyer, however, says, "We
were each doing what we dreamed the show would be. I taped
pieces last summer."
   The slow start-up hurt the show for weeks. Each week,
segments were being edited literally up until the last
minute, sometimes being broadcast from the editing room, a
highly unusual practice for a prime-time news show.
   And the emphasis on being live led to some weird TV. On
Aug. 17, the show reported on the poisoning of the
500-year-old Treaty Oak tree in Austin, Texas -- a live
segment on a dying tree in a black Texas night. It cost
thousands of dollars to light the tree for television.
   Virtually everyone agrees that the show's low live point
came on Thanksgiving, Nov. 23. "Prime Time Live" traveled to
the Truck Stop of America, a homey diner in Ontario, Calif.,
to convey a slice of Americana. But the joint was not exactly
jumping. Throughout much of the live segment, people talked
about what interesting things had happened in the diner
earlier in the day.
   Inside ABC News, that's referred to as the "Thanksgiving
turkey show."
   One quirky and expensive live segment never even made it
on the air. ABC News commissioned a piece on Colossus, a
menacing roller coaster in Valencia, Calif. Five cameras were
set up, a 12-year-old boy riding in the first car was hooked
up to a device showing his pulse and heartbeat, and another
gizmo showed the speed.
   The cost for the elaborate two-minute piece was $150,000.
It worked well in a dress rehearsal, but it was ultimately
scrapped. Some on the show say it didn't go on the air
because it kept getting bumped until it became too dark in
California to show it live. Mr. Kaplan says simply, "It
didn't work."
   Since then, "Prime Time Live's" bright spots have been
accomplished largely without the show's
trademark-turned-albatross-the concept of "live."
   Then there is that live audience. Studio audiences are
more endemic to tabloid television and the likes of
"Geraldo." But ABC News pioneered the concept for network
news with its critically acclaimed town meetings, hosted by
Mr. Koppel.
   Mr. Donaldson says, "The show came with the audience. They
were part of the given of the format. I tried to use the
audience." But Ms. Sawyer says, "I was less comfortable with
the audience. Many times it had nothing to do. It turned us
into performers."
   The two anchors' own discomfort with the live audience
added to their own lack of on-air chemistry, once described
affectionately by ABC News as "fire and ice." Often, Ms.
Sawyer's on-air body language told the story. She would sit,
arms crossed, obviously not relaxed. And she would rib her
co-anchor. On the Sept. 28 broadcast, the two engaged in an
unrehearsed discussion about controversial racial remarks by
comedian Jackie Mason. Mr. Donaldson spoke out against racial
and ethnic jokes. "Let it be said here tonight," Ms. Sawyer
said, "that Sam Donaldson worried over sensitivities. . . . I
want this declared."
   Everyone stresses that Mr. Donaldson and Ms. Sawyer admire
each other's work and like one another personally. But Mr.
Kaplan admits that "the chemistry problem perceived on the
air is an accurate one. They have two remarkable styles, two
very strong styles. It's like an orchid and a rose. They are
gorgeous flowers and they don't make a great bouquet."
   Tonight, as "Prime Time Live" embarks on its second
season, the show's makers are more certain of their
direction. "Topical, hard-hitting pieces and newsmakers,"
says Mr. Kaplan.
   "There's been no time to look at how we got into the
trouble we were in," he adds. "I've only had time to try to
get us out of it each week."
