   United Illuminating Co. -- $211.8 million of Seabrook I
nuclear power plant secured lease-obligation bonds through
underwriters Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Although the bonds are
technically issued by Meridian Bank, the so-called
owner-trustee in the transaction, they are considered
obligations of United Illuminating. The first part, $82.8
million of secured lease-obligation bonds due Jan. 2, 2006,
was priced at par to yield 9.76%. The bonds, which are
non-callable for five years, were priced at a spread of 1.42
percentage points above the Treasury's 10-year note. The
issue has a sinking fund beginning Jan. 2, 1991, giving it an
average life of 10.4 years. The second part, $129 million of
secured-lease obligation bonds due Jan. 2, 2020, was priced
at par to yield 10.24%. The bonds, which are non-callable for
five years, were priced at 1.83 percentage points above the
Treasury's 30-year bond. The issue has a sinking fund
beginning Jan. 2, 2006, giving it an average life of 24.6
years. The issue is rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service
Inc. and triple-Bminus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
