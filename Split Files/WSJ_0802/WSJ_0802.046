   PARIS -- Pathe Cinema S.A., France's oldest film company
and focus of a two-year battle for control, will remain
French.
   Chargeurs S.A., a textiles and communications concern,
said it will pay 1.1 billion French francs ($207.3 million)
for Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti's 47% direct stake
in Pathe Cinema and for a further 52% held by Banque Rivaud.

   The film company, which owns 150 cinemas in France, a
library including French film classics and vintage newsreel,
has been the focus of a long-running saga featuring
high-finance and politics. French officials had said that
France should maintain control of its own cultural history
and patrimony, as represented by the Pathe archives.
   Earlier this year French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy
blocked, for the second time, Banque Rivaud's agreement to
sell its Pathe Cinema stake to Mr. Parretti, arguing that it
could "disrupt public order." Mr. Beregovoy didn't elaborate
how it would threaten public order, but Finance Ministry
officials later said the minister was concerned that the
origin of Mr. Parretti's funds couldn't be traced.
   Mr. Parretti and his allies contend the money came from
successful business transactions, including several hotel
sales in Sicily.
   Salvatore Picciotto, Mr. Parretti's Paris representative,
said in a telephone interview yesterday that his group was
forced to sell its Pathe stake because of France's refusal to
negotiate. He said the group plans to pursue legal
proceedings in France and in the European Court against the
French government. "We want justice," Mr. Picciotto said,
accusing Mr. Beregovoy of blocking the agreement with Banque
Rivaud because "we are not part of the French establishment."
   Mr. Parretti's designs on Pathe were a major element in
his plans to extend his movie empire, which already counts
about 700 cinemas in Europe. Mr. Parretti also is seeking
control of MGM/UA Communications Co. in the U.S. Earlier this
year he agreed to pay $1.3 billion in a proposed merger
between MGM/UA and Pathe Communications Corp.
   Pathe Communications, which is legally unrelated to Pathe
Cinema S.A., was formed out of Cannon Group Inc. and its
European cinema network. Mr. Parretti bought Cannon three
years ago from film makers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus.
   The planned merger with MGM/UA, already delayed several
times because of financing questions, ran into even greater
trouble in June. Time Warner Inc., which had agreed to put up
half of the $1.3 billion, pulled out of its agreement with
Pathe, citing breach of contract. Time Warner and Pathe
currently have law suits pending against each other.
   A Chargeurs official strongly denied that the French
government had asked the company to step in to save Pathe
Cinema. "There was absolutely no government pressure," he
said, adding that other French groups had also been
interested in Pathe.
   "Pathe Cinema will complete what we have already started,"
the Chargeurs official said. "And we won't stop there," he
added, although he declined to identify any targets for
future expansion.
   Charguer Chairman Jerome Seydoux's first foray into media
in 1986 was cut short less than a year later when the new
right-wing government revoked Chargeurs's license to run the
television channel La Cinq.
   Although Mr. Seydoux recovered a stake in La Cinq in 1988
following a change of government, he sold out last May after
losing a boardroom battle against publisher Robert Hersant.
In January, Chargeurs sold its airline Union des Transports
Aeriens to Air France, ending a long battle for new routes
against the national flagcarrier.
   The sale of UTA and La Cinq raised about two billion
francs in cash for Chargeurs, clearing the way for
acquisitions.
   In the last few years Mr. Seydoux has refocused Chargeurs,
selling off all its shipping and transport activities and
buying into textiles, cinema, satellites and television.
   The group already has a 50% stake in French film
production house Renn Productions, as well as film
distribution company AMLF. It also has interests in two new
direct broadcast satellite channels, British Satellite
Broadcasting (BSB) in the U.K. and Sport 2-3 in France.
