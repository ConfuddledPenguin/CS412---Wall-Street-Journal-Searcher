   DALLAS -- Pantera's Corp. said a U.S. bankruptcy court
judge confirmed its plan of reorganization to merge the
company into its Pizza Inn Inc. subsidiary and reconstitute
itself primarily as a franchise-service company.
   The franchiser of Pizza Inn restaurants, which has been
renamed Pizza Inn Inc., said a new board has been elected
with the approval of creditors.
