   I was outraged that you published and consequently
endorsed Dave Shiflett's review "Bookshorts: Help for the
Suburban Yard Slave" (Leisure &amp; Arts, July 17). In the guise
of a book review on how-to manuals for lawn-mower repairs,
the author has found a rather unimaginative way to divulge
his prehistoric sexist thinking. I am disappointed that the
editors of The Wall Street Journal did not recognize this
rhetoric as offensive bigotry.
   The article, based on the premise that man is inherently
"oppressed" by woman, is blatantly insolent in its attempt to
make a potentially dull subject humorous. It is not difficult
to imagine Mr. Shiflett to be a morally inept, social outcast
in any slightly progressive society. His article became
quickly ineffectual in reviewing the manuals because of the
emotional response it provoked by attacking women as being a
race of low-IQ slave drivers who sit indoors packing
themselves with carbohydrates.

   What a pity it must be to live in Mr. Shiflett's world of
fat, screaming wives who demand a manicured lawn before they
can feel at peace with themselves and their marriages. I find
little in common with the people who must live on Mr.
Shiflett's little suburban block and I am sure that most of
your well-educated and enterprising readers would agree.
