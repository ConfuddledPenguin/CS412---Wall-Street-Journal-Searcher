   SANTA ANA, Calif. -- EECO Inc., which sought
bankruptcy-law protection in May, said it sold for about $1.4
million certain assets of its Maxi-Switch computer keyboard
division to Silitek, a Taiwan-based electronics concern.
   George B. Dehuff, EECO president and chief executive
officer, said some sale proceeds will be used to reduce
EECO's $10.3 million debt to Sanwa Bank of California, with
the rest going to support EECO's restructuring plan.
