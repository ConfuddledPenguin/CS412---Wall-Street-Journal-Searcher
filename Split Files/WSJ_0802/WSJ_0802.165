   IRAQI TROOPS CROSSED into Kuwait, the Kuwaiti Embassy
reported.
   In Washington, a Kuwaiti Embassy official said that Iraqi
troops had begun a major push across the Kuwaiti border.
Western diplomats said that explosions were heard in Kuwait
after four unidentified aircraft flew over the small Persian
Gulf state before dawn. The action followed the collapse of
talks between Iraq and Kuwait aimed at resolving a
two-week-old dispute over borders, oil and finances. Baghdad
officials had complained that Kuwait wasn't negotiating
seriously at the talks in Saudi Arabia.

committees; and, for the first time, provides taxpayer
subsidies for certain campaign costs such as TV air time and
postage.
   Last week, the Senate denounced Sen. Durenberger, a
Minnesota Republican, for ethical violations including a
book-promotion scheme allowing him to evade honorarium
limits.

the government.
