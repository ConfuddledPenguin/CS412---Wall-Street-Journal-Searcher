   They are Robert E. Morrison of Longmont, Colo., former

   The two men were charged by the U.S. Justice Department
and the Arizona attorney general in a five-count indictment
that alleges conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and omitting material information or making
false representations about hazardous waste incidents at the
plant to government regulators and inspectors.
   According to the indictment, hazardous wastes were
released from plant units supervised by the two men. If found
guilty on all counts, both defendants could be sentenced to
16 years imprisonment and fined as much as $1.2 million.
   The two defendants couldn't be reached for comment. A
spokesman for Hughes Aircraft said the company participated
in the investigation and cooperated with the government and
wasn't named in the indictment. The spokesman said the
company had no comment on the indictment.
