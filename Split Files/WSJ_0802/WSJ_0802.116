   WASHINGTON -- The House Armed Services Committee voted to
protect military bases in the U.S. from being closed in 1991,
while laying the groundwork for massive base-closings and
troop cuts in Europe over the next few years.
   As part of a $283 billion authorization bill for the
Pentagon, the committee voted to block Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney from closing any more domestic bases until at least
Jan. 1, 1992. But at the same time, the panel ordered the
Pentagon to provide Congress with a detailed plan examining
whether most of the 336,000 troops currently based in Europe
can't be brought back to the U.S. by 1994.

   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an
$8 billion military construction bill that also shifts funds
toward U.S. bases and away from bases overseas. The spending
bill would cut more than $1.15 billion from the Pentagon's
fiscal 1991 budget and reduce U.S. contribution to North
Atlantic Treaty Organization infrastructure accounts by 50%.
   The Senate money bill wouldn't provide any funds for
construction in Japan or Korea, and cuts back sharply on
Pentagon requests for facilities in Europe.
   The appropriations measure represents a further $331
million cut beyond the House-passed version of the same bill.
While leaving some leeway for the Bush administration, the
committee joined the House in freezing any further U.S.
contributions for construction of a major NATO air base at
Crotone, Italy.
   The Armed Services Committee's authorization bill also
would cancel construction of the base. Authorization bills
set policy legislatively and provide a ceiling on the money
spent for programs. Appropriations bills represent the actual
money and allow committees to influence policy by their power
over the purse.
   The House committee's action doesn't affect plans to shut
down more than 80 domestic military bases picked for closure
by a blue-ribbon commission and ratified by Congress last
year. The panel, however, voted to reduce Secretary Cheney's
authority and flexibility to propose a "hit list" of
additional bases.
   Intent on concentrating on cutbacks outside the U.S., the
committee voted to require the Pentagon -- for the first time
since the end of World War II -- to draft plans for dual
basing of troops in Western Europe. Under this concept, most
of the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps units currently
stationed there, as well as their dependents, would be
brought back to U.S. bases. Small contingents of troops would
return periodically to a few European bases for training and
military exercises during six-month tours, but the cost of
keeping them there would be far less than under the current
system.
   Both the domestic and foreign base-closing provisions are
strongly opposed by the Bush administration and Republican
congressional leaders, and they are bound to prompt spirited
debate on the House floor.
