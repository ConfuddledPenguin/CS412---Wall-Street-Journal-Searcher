   Tokyo stock prices, after a strong advance on Tuesday,
fell sharply from intraday highs on Wednesday because of
arbitrage selling in the late afternoon.
   In London, share prices finished a listless session firmer
amid a dearth of corporate news to stimulate activity.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues closed at 30837.99, off
197.67 points. Near the end of the session, the index picked
up 100 points on index-linked buying to finish above intraday
lows. On Tuesday, the index advanced 592.71 points.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell
238.17 points to 30599.82.
   Wednesday's first section volume was estimated at 430
million shares, up from 382 million shares on Tuesday.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,
which gained 27.27 points on Tuesday, eased 5.88 to 2246.68.
The Second Section Index, which soared 73.33 points on
Tuesday, rose 13.93 to 4436.26. Second section volume was
estimated at 37.2 million shares, up from 29.8 million shares
a day earlier.
   The yen's strengthening against the dollar in Japan and
abroad, which was prompted by growing expectations for lower
U.S. interest rates, helped push up bond prices. Responding
favorably to the stabler bond market, the Nikkei Index
advanced 335 points early in the morning session. Despite the
Nikkei's gains, analysts said, the market lacked strength,
reflecting investors' perception that domestic interest rates
haven't peaked.
   Most investors held off from buying any stocks at prices
above levels considered to be "very good bargains," a trader
at Daiwa Securities Co. said. The market failed to sustain
the initial morning gains as the trading focus blurred, with
buying gradually spread over a wide range of issues, traders
said.
   Rounds of arbitrage selling in midafternoon were triggered
by a decline in the futures index, a trader said. This was a
reaction to reports linking the yen's strengthening against
the dollar to narrowing between Japanese and U.S. short-term
interest rates, which were at equal levels in the Euro money
market Tuesday for the first time since November 1985. This
in turn led to predictions that high Japanese interest rates
will discourage active participation by Japanese investors at
next week's U.S. Treasury bond auctions, observers said. Such
predictions, together with the dollar's weakness against most
major currencies, prompted speculation that the U.S. currency
may lose some credibility. The market also was affected by
speculation that the U.S. economy may be slowing down at a
faster pace than expected. All these speculations eventually
grew to rumors that New York stocks would plunge, traders
said.
   Advancing shares included interest rate-sensitive issues,
which were hunted for bargains, as they had been viewed as
oversold in the past week, and small-capitalization shares
with strong earnings outlooks, traders said.
   Daiwa Securities rose 30 yen to 1,330 yen ($9.12) a share.
Shipbuilding companies firmed, with IHI ending at 954, up 4.
   Kansai Electric Power rose 40 to 3,140, and Tokyo Electric
Power gained 60 to 3,930.
   Bridgestone rose 10 to 1,450 after predicting Tuesday that
pretax profit for the current fiscal year will increase 11%.
   Skylark advanced 100 to 3,630 on expectation of growing
sales and pretax earnings for the current fiscal year,
traders said. The gains encouraged buying of shares of other
restaurant chains.
   In London, shares were propelled higher from the start on
markups, stock-index futures buying, and a general shortage
of blue-chip leaders, dealers said. But the romp higher ran
out of steam, and stocks languished until midafternoon when
Wall Street opened, giving the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share Index a modest fillip.
   But generally, market professionals said, equities
suffered from a seasonal lack of investor interest and
activity as August began. Several sectors were strong, most
notably oil, but investors were keeping a watchful eye during
the afternoon on developments on Wall Street. New York
stocks, however, turned out to have little impact on London
participants.
   The FT-SE 100 closed at 2339.0, up 12.8 points, after
traveling between a minimum of 2329.3 and an intraday high of
2346.7. Volume was a moderate 419.2 million shares, compared
with 301.5 million shares a day earlier. The Financial Times
30-share index rose 8.3 points to 1852.8.
   The biggest gainer on the day was Enterprise Oil, up 17
pence at 668 pence ($12.46). Dealers said the stock benefited
from sharpened Mideast tensions and rumors that Atlantic
Richfield has expressed interest in buying the 25% stakes
that Imperial Chemical Industries of Britain and Elf
Aquitaine of France hold in Enterprise. But a meager 692,000
shares were traded.
   Other oil issues were boosted on news that reconciliation
talks between Kuwait and Iraq collapsed. Their two-week-old
dispute about oil, borders and money has been accompanied by
a show of Iraqi military strength at the borders. British
Petroleum gained 7 to 340. Shell Transport &amp; Trading rose 9
to 483.
   Abbey National gained 4 to 218 after posting a 39%
increase in interim pretax profit to #280 million ($522.2
million), in line with market expectations.
   Rank Organisation fell 9 to 754, and its takeover target,
Mecca, was unchanged at 80. The Department of Trade and
Industry said the deal would be referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission unless Rank moved to reduce the effect
of owning 60% of London bingo halls.
   Kingfisher fell 6 to 356. Morgan Stanley International
downgraded the retailer on concern about the outlook for its
property portfolio, given the slump in Britain's economy.
   Elsewhere, equity prices closed higher in Stockholm and
lower in Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels and Milan and were mixed
in Amsterdam. The Zurich market was closed for a holiday.
   Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Sydney,
Singapore, Taipei and Seoul, were mixed in Manila and ended
lower in Wellington.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
