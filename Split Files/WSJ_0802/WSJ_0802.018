   TOKYO -- Japan's sales of cars, trucks and buses in July
increased 5.9% from a year earlier to 591,230 units, a record
for the month, and rose 10.2% from the previous month, the
Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said.
   The July data marked the 17th consecutive month in which
vehicle sales in Japan posted a record for the month,
supported by strong demand by domestic industries and
individual consumers, as the nation's economy continues to
expand.
