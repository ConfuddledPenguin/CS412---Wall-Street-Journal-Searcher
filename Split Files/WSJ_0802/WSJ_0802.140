   WASHINGTON -- Here is the list of 71 properties that the
Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency cleaning up the
thrift mess, plans to auction over a nationwide television
hookup on Nov. 15. However, properties could be sold prior to
the televised auction, an RTC official said.
   The agency said that later this month it will be able to
provide complete information about each property.
