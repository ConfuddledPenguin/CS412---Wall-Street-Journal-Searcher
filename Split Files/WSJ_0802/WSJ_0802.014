   MADRID -- Spain's state-controlled oil concern Repsol S.A.
said first-half profit rose 1.4% to 39.68 billion pesetas
($406.6 million) from 39.14 billion pesetas a year earlier,
but called the results "positive," in light of the
"extraordinarily strong" 1989 first-half results and lower
crude oil prices.
   Revenue fell 11% to 58.455 billion pesetas from 65.413
billion pesetas. But Repsol said that without an 11
billion-peseta depreciation on the value of its crude-oil and
oil-products inventories, revenue would have totaled more
than 69 billion pesetas.

   Repsol predicted that higher world oil prices will boost
second-half revenue, and said a move by the Spanish
government partly to deregulate gasoline prices will help
lift earnings.
