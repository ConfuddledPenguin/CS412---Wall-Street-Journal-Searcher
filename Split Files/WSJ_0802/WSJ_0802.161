   LSI Industries Inc., Cincinnati, citing softness in its
commercial-lighting business and other factors, said it
expects to report a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of about $1.3
million, or 28 cents a share.
   That compares with year-earlier net income of $1.4
million, or 27 cents a share.

   Sales in the quarter, which ended June 30, the company
said, were $20.2 million, down from $22.1 million a year
earlier.
   For the full fiscal year, LSI said it expects to report
net income of $1.4 million, or 29 cents a share, compared
with net of $4 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales were $83.7 million, compared with $57.4 million last
year. Final audited figures are expected by mid-August.
   LSI said sales of its graphics group, which provides
commercial lighting, were below prior-year levels for the
June quarter principally due to graphics programs of certain
petroleum customers being deferred or reduced in scope.
Further, Duramark Ltd., LSI's graphics subsidiary, had
significant unexpected costs relating to entering the U.K.
and European architectural graphics markets, the company
said.
