   Ranchmen's Resources Ltd. said it agreed to purchase the
oil and natural gas assets of Bralorne Resources Ltd. for 33
million Canadian dollars (US$28.6 million).
   The Calgary, Alberta, concern said the acquisition will
help it achieve its goal of balancing its production between
oil and natural gas. The Bralorne assets include estimated
proven gas reserves of 53 billion cubic feet and 1.4 million
barrels of proven oil and natural gas liquids reserves.

   Ranchmen's also will acquire 50,000 acres of undeveloped
land and nine gas plants. The properties are concentrated in
east-central Alberta and farther north near Peace River,
Alberta.
   Bralorne's oil and gas division accounted for about 40% of
the company's assets but only about 15% of its operating
revenue, the Calgary concern said. Its other two operating
divisions, the Canadian and U.S. industrial groups, provide
products and services for the drilling and exploration
sectors of the energy industry in North America.
