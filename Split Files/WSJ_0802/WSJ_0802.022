   Watching "The Freshman" is like listening to an amiable
eccentric trying to tell an intricate and entertaining joke
but not quite pulling it off. You're glad to laugh anyway
because the whole scene moves with such a bizarre and
original rhythm the missed beats don't seem to matter.
   Director and writer Andrew Bergman has used this Mafia
farce as a showcase for Marlon Brando's exquisitely metered
piece of self-parody. Mr. Brando gently mocks his status as
pop icon without belittling the films that carried some of
his most venerated performances. Playing Carmine Sabatini, an
unconventional Mafia boss with a particular fondness for
endangered wildlife, Mr. Brando slyly invokes "The
Godfather's" Don Corleone even as he makes Carmine something
entirely new.

   Mr. Bergman, best known as a writer of light Broadway
comedy, has put Mr. Brando at the center of a complicated
piece of comic machinery. He gets it all moving with the
story of Clark Kellogg (Matthew Broderick), a boy from
Vermont who goes to film school in New York City and almost
immediately finds himself tangled up with the mob. Mr.
Broderick's habitual pose of the naive-yet-knowing wise guy
works well here, as Clark both narrates and acts out this
improbable tale.
   The picture flounders at the beginning, as Mr. Bergman
tries to establish Clark's nightmarish introduction to New
York. No sooner is Clark off the train at Grand Central
Station than he's hustled by a fast-talking con artist who
drives the newcomer downtown for too much money, then steals
all his things. The reception isn't much warmer at school,
where his film professor and adviser hasn't any sympathy for
Clark's predicament.
   These opening scenes have a purpose, though, which is to
bring Clark together with Carmine, and to set the stage for
numerous "Godfather" jokes, which Mr. Bergman has written
with a generous touch of absurdity. Yet he's more certain as
writer than director; he doesn't always choreograph the
visual wit in a way that will bring the jokes to life,
especially at the beginning. The movie starts out sluggish
and awkward, like a dance-school student who can mouth the
steps ("slow, quick quick . . .") but forgets to move his
feet.
   Eventually, however, the picture does get under way and
turns up many strange pleasures, not least of which is the
incomparable sight of Bert Parks hosting a bit of gastronomic
pageantry featuring a menu consisting entirely of endangered
species.
   Many of the film-school jokes either don't work or are
somewhat esoteric (like the giant poster of Brian De Palma's
glowering face at the back of a classroom). But one doesn't
need to have studied film to appreciate Paul Benedict's Prof.
Fleeber, a man who has thought entirely too much about the
relationship between Karl Marx and the Lake Tahoe scene in
"The Godfather."
   As Prof. Fleeber delves deeper and deeper into the
make-believe Mafia, Clark becomes an errand boy for the real
thing. He gets to meet Carmine's family, a much more good
natured and easy-going crew than the Corleone clan. For
example, his daughter, Tina (Penelope Ann Miller), earnestly
explains her credentials for Harvard: If she doesn't get in,
the garbage won't get picked up anymore. She and her father
live in an overdone suburban palazzo, and their prize
possession is Leonardo Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," wired to play
Nat King Cole's "Mona Lisa" with the touch of a
remote-control button.
   The picture never loses the feeling of being slightly
unbalanced. Yet lack of glibness becomes endearing at a time
when so many pictures consist of slick surface and nothing
else. Besides, "The Freshman's" ungainliness is continually
steadied by Mr. Brando's sure presence. Pay attention right
up to the end, or you will miss the picture's best joke, Mr.
Brando's sweet, goofy homage to "On the Waterfront."

   Louis Malle's most recent film, "May Fools," opens with
the death of a bright-eyed elderly woman. Just before she
dies, she's listening to news of strikes and student revolt
-- it's 1968 -- and weeping. When the camera pulls back,
however, you see she's crying because she's cutting onions.
Shortly thereafter she gasps, walks slowly up the stairs,
falls on a couch occupied by antique dolls, and dies.
   Mr. Malle stages this scene with a tone that is both
poignant and lightly mocking, a tone he maintains throughout
this enjoyable picture about the 1968 "revolution" in France
and its effect on one bourgeois family. The events all take
place on the dead woman's country estate, where she's lived
with her middle-aged son and where her varied eccentric heirs
descend to divvy up the goods. They are forced to stay longer
than planned, because the funeral workers are on strike. With
grandma's body lying in the parlor, more and more resembling
just another piece of antique furniture, her children and
grandchildren play out the changes affecting the wider world
among themselves.
   All of this is carried out with a gentle touch, as Mr.
Malle develops the foibles of his various types: the
middle-aged man who refuses to "grow up"; his annoyingly
responsible daughter; the young man calling for revolution
who seduces his aunt's girlfriend. It's all very pretty and
amusing, in keeping with the breezy Stephane Grappelli music
that makes it all hum.

   VIDEO TIP: It's always fun to take a look at Marlon Brando
over the years, and "On the Waterfront" is a good place to
start. Though you'll want to look at the obvious films --
"The Godfather," "Last Tango in Paris," "The Wild One,"
"Streetcar Named Desire" -- check out failed ventures such as
"The Missouri Breaks" as well. You can always fast-forward.
