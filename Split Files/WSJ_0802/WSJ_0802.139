   Tons of Toys Inc., Wareham, Mass., said the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Boston approved its reorganization plan
under which it will be acquired by T.H.E. Corp., a closely
held Los Angeles toy retailer.
   Under the plan, a venture capital investor and bank that
held convertible subordinated debt of Tons of Toys will
exchange this debt for shares of convertible preferred stock
of Tons of Toys. The plan also requires a reverse stock split
in which public holders of Tons of Toys common stock will
convert every 34.85192 shares of common stock for one share
of common stock. T.H.E. shareholders will hold about 65% of
the combined companies. Unsecured creditors are expected to
receive about $2.8 million, or 20 cents on the dollar, of
their claims.

   Bank Niaga, Indonesia, which is T.H.E. Corp.'s principal
lender, will increase its credit line to provide credit to
Tons of Toys to finance inventory and working capital
requirements, Tons of Toys said.
   Bruno R. Ferretti, president, said that the completion of
the bankruptcy proceedings will allow Tons of Toys to resume
normal operations in its stores. Tons of Toys operates 20 toy
supermarkets in the Northeast. T.H.E. operates 32 stores in
California, Nevada and Washington.
