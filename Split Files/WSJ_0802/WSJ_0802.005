   SEOUL, South Korea -- Reduced imports helped South Korea
register a trade surplus for the second straight month in
July, but the nation's current account balance is still in a
shaky position, officials said.
   The Trade-Industry Ministry said Korea's trade showed a
surplus of $6 million in July on a customs clearance basis.
This compared with a $230 million June surplus.

   Korean exports grew 5.1% in July from a year ago, to
$5.502 billion, while imports expanded 6.7%, to $5.496
billion, producing a surplus of $6 million, the officials
said.
   The July surplus reduced Korea's seven-month trade deficit
to $2.76 billion, which compared with a $1.6 billion surplus
a year ago, they said.
