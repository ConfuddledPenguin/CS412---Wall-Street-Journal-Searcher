   LOS ANGELES -- Joe Isuzu's days are numbered. And that's
no lie.
   A new ad campaign from American Isuzu Motors, the first in
four years not to feature its lying "Joe Isuzu" pitchman,
will begin airing Aug. 13. The new spots? Get ready for campy
ads starring lizards, bees and alligators.

   Venturing out without Joe, a likeable but smarmy guy who
distorted the benefits of Isuzu cars and trucks, is a risky
move. The character, played by comic actor David Leisure,
established little-known Isuzu in the minds of American car
buyers. The humorous, clever commercials routinely topped
consumer polls of favorite ad campaigns.
   But in an interview at Della Femina McNamee's office here,
where Isuzu's ads are cooked up, executives involved in the
launch of the new campaign described why Joe got the ax:
Isuzu cars -- unlike Isuzu trucks -- don't sell well, and
Joe's getting the blame.
   "It was our judgment that Joe doesn't do as good a job
selling passenger cars as he does with trucks," said Fritz
Kern, senior vice president at American Isuzu, the U.S. arm
of Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan. Isuzu's sporty Impulse car,
for example, "is a pretty serious car. It's in a highly
competitive segment and the people who are interested in it
see a dichotomy between the Joe Isuzu character and that kind
of product."
   Isuzu this month will introduce three new models, two of
which are passenger cars. "The product line transition that
we're going through right now is probably the biggest impetus
to our giving serious consideration to an alternative
campaign," Mr. Kern said. All of the new ads feature a young
guy who acts as on-camera spokesman -- but unlike Joe Isuzu,
the spokesman is nameless and isn't the focus of the ads.
   One ad, perhaps the most clever of the new spots, pits an
Isuzu pickup against a Toyota pickup in an end-of-the-world
minidrama. "If Earth were invaded by giant reptiles, which
would be better prepared?" asks the spokesman. The two trucks
are shown parked on a busy city street as giant lizards,
towering above skyscrapers, emerge from the side streets.
It's all done in kitschy B-movie style: Young executives
scream and run for cover. Fires break out. A policeman yells
"Get out of here]"
   The spokesman continues: "Well, first of all, the Isuzu
gets better mileage than Toyota." The Toyota, speeding down
the street away from a giant lizard, comes to a screeching
halt as the camera focuses on its "empty" gas gauge. "That's
helpful," the guy says, as an ugly reptile crushes that
truck. The Isuzu, of course, drives away, escaping the
lizards.
   Another new spot, this one for Isuzu's new Rodeo,
demonstrates the key advantage of the sports utility truck,
the fact that it seats six, over Toyota's 4Runner, which
seats only five. Here, the narrator demonstrates the
advantage by releasing a box of ticked-off bees near two
families of six. One family climbs into the Rodeo and drives
off. One member of the other family, though, can't fit into
the 4Runner and instead dives into a pond to escape the bees.
   Some marketing specialists say dropping Joe is a mistake.
They charge that Isuzu simply has tired of the campaign, but
say consumers haven't. "The lizard spot would be a perfect
commercial for Joe to star in," said David Vadehra, president
of Video Storyboard Tests Inc., an ad-tracking firm whose
annual surveys routinely ranked Isuzu's campaigns in the top
10.
   "I don't think they should be chucking the whole concept,"
Mr. Vadehra said. "They have spent four years establishing
him. If he's doing a good job selling trucks, why not keep
him?" Mr. Vadehra and others said the character might
continue effectively even in ads for Isuzu cars, but in
perhaps a more supporting role, deferring to the cars as
star.
   "To get through the clutter of auto advertising is a
horrendous challenge. These people did it brilliantly," said
Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer at
Lippincott &amp; Margulies Inc., a New York identity and image
consultant. "I'm surprised that they are walking away from
all that equity."
   But Peter Stranger, president of Della Femina's office
here, insisted the decision to drop Joe wasn't made lightly.
"There was no grand scheme to assassinate Joe Isuzu," he
said. "Every year we assessed how successful he was being.
You don't want to stay too long and you don't want to get out
too early. The bigger mistake would be to stay too long."
   Mr. Stranger said four different campaigns were tested to
find the best campaign to replace Joe Isuzu. He said
executives at the agency entertained the idea of keeping Joe
just for truck ads but later decided that wouldn't work.
"This year we had very good alternatives," he said.
   The driving force behind the switch is Isuzu's desire to
become a major player in the U.S. passenger car market and,
in particular, to become a stronger competitor to Toyota.
   Sales of Isuzu cars have been disappointing. In the first
six months of the year, sales of Isuzu import cars plummeted
81% to just 1,810 units, though Isuzu says the drop occurred
because expected new-model shipments didn't arrive at
showrooms as scheduled. Truck sales, however, jumped 27% to
56,690 units in the first half of the year.
   "Passenger cars have never represented a very high share
of our sales volume," Isuzu's Mr. Kern said. The company has
high hopes that its new passenger cars -- including its
Stylus and remodeled Impulse -- will be the answer to the car
sales dilemma.
   As for the new campaign, both Mr. Kern and Mr. Stranger
are confident they are making the right move. "We're moving
on, but we're not turning around 180 degrees," Mr. Kern said.
He added, though, that the company is "reserving the right"
to bring Joe Isuzu back -- while denying flatly that Isuzu
dumped the campaign because of extraordinary salary demands
by Mr. Leisure, the actor, as had been rumored.
   "I got a personal, handwritten letter from him thanking us
for this long association," Mr. Kern said. "He realized that
most campaigns don't last four years. His life changed -- all
for the better -- and so did ours."
