   OAKLAND, Calif. -- Clorox Co. said it completed the
previously reported purchase of American Cyanamid Co.'s
household products business for $465 million.
   The purchase covers Cyanamid's well-known Pine Sol cleaner
and Combat insecticide labels and is expected to boost
Clorox's annual revenue by about $235 million. Clorox, with
about $1.5 billion in annual sales, sells a number of
household grocery products in addition to its popular bleach.
