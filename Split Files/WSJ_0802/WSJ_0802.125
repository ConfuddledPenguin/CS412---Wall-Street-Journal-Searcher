   The Manville personal-injury trust, which has run out of
cash needed to pay thousands of claims by asbestos victims,
said it supports a court-ordered freeze temporarily barring
it from paying any settlements or judgments.
   In a brief filed in federal appeals court in New York, the
trust said the freeze ordered last month by U.S. Judge Jack
B. Weinstein will give it some breathing room as it tries to
solve its current cash shortfall. The brief was filed in
response to requests by two groups of asbestos victims who
want the freeze lifted.

   The trust, which was formed as part of Manville Corp.'s
bankruptcy-court reorganization plan in 1986, also told the
appeals court that its financial condition has worsened
rapidly in recent weeks. Judge Weinstein began pressuring the
trust to restructure its financing after it told asbestos
victims that current settlements wouldn't be paid at all for
more than 20 years-long after most of the claimants will have
died. Asbestos, once widely used in insulation, causes cancer
and respiratory ailments.
   The trust said that as of June 30 it had total assets of
$2.62 billion, but only $156.2 million in cash. To pay the
claims that already have been settled, the trust needs cash
totaling $365.7 million, of which $68.9 million is payable
between now and March 31, 1991. After paying operating
expenses and litigation costs, the trust will need to borrow
at least $30 million by March 31, assuming that no additional
claims are settled in the meantime.
   "To date, the trust has been unable to find a lending
institution willing to make such a loan," the trust said in
the brief. "Pursuant to the terms of the Manville plan of
reorganization, the trust must continue to settle cases and
thus the trust's borrowing requirements will become more
severe." The trust said it is "severely restricted" in its
ability to convert its assets -- mainly Manville stock -- to
cash.
   Judge Weinstein also filed a response with the appeals
court, defending his power to issue the freeze and making it
clear that he has staked out broad authority over all
problems arising out of the Manville reorganization plan. The
judge's response said the trust faces a deficit of $19.6
million this year on claims that have already been settled,
and that the trust's current value will cover less than a
fourth of the 130,000 claims that so far have been filed.
   The response, filed on the judge's behalf by Kenneth
Feinberg of the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman,
Hays &amp; Handler, said the freeze and other changes sought in
the trust by Judge Weinstein shouldn't be seen as a
modification of the Manville reorganization plan. Instead,
Mr. Feinberg wrote, the changes are needed to ensure that the
plan is implemented as planned. Huge injury claims pushed
Manville into bankruptcy proceedings.
   In its filing, the trust said it won't object to an
extension of the freeze, which now is set to end Monday.
Judge Weinstein has given the trust until Monday to propose a
restructuring of its finances to alleviate the cash
shortfall.

   FORMER ASBESTOS MAKERS can pursue case to hold U.S. liable
for damages.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed
a federal claims court judge who had thrown out the
manufacturers' cases. The companies, which face thousands of
personal-injury suits for illnesses caused by asbestos, want
the government to be held partly responsible. Many of the
suits stem from workers' exposure to asbestos at Navy yards.
   The claims court judge had ruled that the suit had to be
thrown out because the companies had similar claims pending
in other courts when they brought the suit. But the appeals
court said the restriction on suing in claims court, which
mainly deals with contract disputes with the U.S. government,
only applies if the other suits are still pending when the
claims court takes action.
   The appellate decision sends the case back to the claims
court to decide whether the U.S. government is liable for
some of the damages. Joe Hollingsworth, an attorney for UNR
Industries Inc. and Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., said the
federal government should be held liable for some of the
damages because the U.S. specified that asbestos be used in
the shipyard work even after the government knew of the
health risks. He said that under contract law, the U.S. also
had a responsibility to disclose to the asbestos makers
information about the risks of the product.
   A spokesman for the Justice Department said the U.S. is
reviewing the decision and declined to comment further.
   Mr. Hollingsworth, of the Washington firm Spriggs &amp;
Hollingsworth, said that more than half of all asbestos cases
involve work for the U.S. military.

   BLACK LAWYERS SAY High Court's pro-civil rights era has
ended.
   A panel of constitutional law and civil rights experts
told lawyers attending the annual National Bar Association
meeting in Houston that they should not look to the U.S.
Supreme Court as a defender of civil rights and liberties in
coming decades.
   The NBA, a predominately black organization, was formed 65
years ago as an alternative to the American Bar Association,
which at the time didn't allow blacks to join. An estimated
1,000 attorneys attended the weeklong convention.
   The prevailing mood among some 200 lawyers who attended
the opening seminar early this week, "Minorities and the
Supreme Court 1990's: Reconstruction Revisited," was bleak.
There seemed to be a consensus that the second Reconstruction
Era had ended.
   "Do you remember the phrase, `I'm going to take this all
the way to the Supreme Court?'" asked panelist Kim Taylor,
director of the Washington's Public Defender Service. "Now
that phrase strikes terror in my heart." Ms. Taylor said the
High Court is made up of "mean-spirited conservative
crusaders who have no experience with poverty and racism."
   The panelists likened the coming years to the
post-Reconstruction period. During Reconstruction, the time
following the Civil War, the civil rights of blacks were
bolstered by new constitutional amendments and legislation.
But in the 1890s, the court turned its back on blacks by
adopting a separate-but-equal approach to racial equality.
   Linda Greene, a professor at University of Wisconsin Law
School, sounded the most pessimistic note when she said, "If
we are still resolving 19th century questions in the 21st
century, we must ask if significant change is possible within
the {legal} framework."
   But Stephen Carter, a professor at Yale University Law
School, said the hard times ahead might force blacks to be
more resourceful.
   "Most social movements . . . have succeeded without the
help of the courts," Mr. Carter said. "We have to ask what it
is we can offer as a common cause with the great majority of
voters. That's the only way you can elect a president."
   Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, said he shared the panel's assessment of the
Supreme Court, adding that if nominee David Souter is
confirmed "we'll have two or three decades of conservative
decisions."
   Mr. Chambers called on the lawyers to lobby Congress so
that the proposed Civil Rights bill of 1990 is passed. That
law, in effect, would overturn a number of civil rights
rulings by the high court in the past few years.
   Still, Mr. Chambers urged the lawyers not to ignore the
Supreme Court. "Even if we devote more attention to the
political process we still need to focus on the court," he
said.

   A NEW SUIT IS FILED in the wake of the second McMartin
trial.
   Raymond Buckey, the former California preschool teacher
acquitted last week of child-molestation charges, has filed a
civil lawsuit against defendants that include Los Angeles
County, the former Los Angeles district attorney who brought
the 1984 indictment against Mr. Buckey, as well as Capital
Cities/ABC Inc. and a former reporter who covered the
McMartin case.
   A spokesman for the county declined to comment on the
lawsuit. The former prosecutor and ABC couldn't be reached
for comment.
   Mr. Buckey is claiming damages for violation of his civil
rights, malicious prosecution, defamation and conspiracy,
according to his attorney, Scott Bernstein of the Los Angeles
law firm of Bauer, O'Brien &amp; Bernstein.
   Mr. Bernstein said his client "will be seeking millions
and millions of dollars. . . . We can't give him back the
five years he spent in prison but maybe we can help him put
his life back together."

   AMERICAN FIRMS IN HONG KONG are seeking help from the U.S.
government.
   The law firms want the government to intercede in their
two-year effort to get permission to hire local lawyers. Last
week, Hong Kong Attorney General Jeremy Mathews informed the
Law Society, which represents the interests of Hong Kong
firms, and several foreign law firms that the rules wouldn't
be altered. The Law Society has agreed to terms providing for
"close association" between local and foreign law firms and
fee-sharing arrangements, but it's opposed to the hiring of
local lawyers by foreign firms.
   "We are going to continue" to fight the policy by using
"the resources of the U.S. government," said Ben Fishburne,
co-chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce Legal
Committee in the territory. "There are trade-law remedies
that are available to us. In the meantime, we will work with
the U.S. consulate and do what we can through jawboning,"
said Mr. Fishburne, a partner with the U.S. law firm of
Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue.
   In an interview during a visit to Hong Kong recently, U.S.
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said that for Hong Kong
"to take such a narrow view seemed out of character." He
described the government's decision as an "aberration" in
Hong Kong's reputation as a free market. Mr. Mosbacher said
that he was planning to raise the issue during his visit. He
declined to say with whom he would speak, but Mr. Fishburne
said later that Mr. Mosbacher discussed the matter with Hong
Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson.
   "We don't want to practice local law," said Mr. Fishburne.
"We just want local legal services under our roof. Lawyers
that work on the same projects work best in close proximity."
