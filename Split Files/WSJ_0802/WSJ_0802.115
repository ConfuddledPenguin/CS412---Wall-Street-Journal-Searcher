   XIAMEN, China -- Not long ago, when mainland Chinese
wanted to see their capitalist brethren in Taiwan, they had
to climb a steep hill in Xiamen and, for about 20 cents a
minute, peer through a powerful telescope trained on the
enemy-held territory across the strait.
   Today it's easier. Here in Xiamen, and all across China's
Fujian province, the Taiwanese have landed. Taking advantage
of relaxed attitudes at home and China's desperate need for
investment and foreign exchange, several hundred thousand
people from Taiwan have stormed the mainland, crossing the
Taiwan Strait to tour, visit relatives and, most importantly,
invest.

   Leading the stampede are people like Liu Yuen-chi, a
Taiwan-born business manager of one of Xiamen's biggest
electric-appliance manufacturers. His factory, financed with
Taiwan cash and stocked with new Taiwan-made production
lines, is clean and bright, unlike the typically sooty and
ill-lit mainland sweatshops.
   "We are trying to introduce the concept of private
enterprise in China," says Mr. Liu, who looks every bit a
foreign import himself in his crisp blue shirt and expensive
red silk tie. "In 10 years, China is going to look more and
more like Taiwan."
   It is one of the cold war's great ironies. The tiny,
breakaway island of Taiwan, whose anti-Communist rulers once
devised plans for militarily retaking the mainland, now is
launching a peaceful invasion that is helping prop up China's
ailing socialist economy. Even when tourist revenue and
foreign investment in general plummeted in the wake of last
year's political upheaval in China, the flood from Taiwan
continued to surge.
   "Taiwan no longer is trying to recover the mainland," says
David Shambaugh, a Sinologist at the University of London.
"It's trying to buy it back."
   Chinese officials are ecstatic about what they call "the
big typhoon" from Taiwan. But many Xiamen people aren't so
happy about the influx of so many of their wealthy Taiwan
compatriots.
   "True, the Taiwanese are helping develop our economy,"
says Li Liwei, a young elementary school teacher in Xiamen.
"But they adopt an air of superiority toward Chinese on the
mainland. They seem to think all Chinese women are either
prostitutes or potential mistresses."
   Taiwan's capitalists aren't investing in China out of any
desire to build up the backward mainland. They have come
because there is money to be made here, and because the
luster is starting to fade on Taiwan's economic miracle.
   Taiwan has enjoyed years of high-speed, trade-led growth.
Exports last year were more than $66 billion, helping push
average income for the island's 20 million people to more
than $8,500, one of the highest levels in Asia. But runaway
development and new-found wealth -- Taiwan has foreign
exchange reserves of about $70 billion, nearly equal Japan's
-- have also led to steep land prices, rising labor costs and
a strong local currency. All this has led many Taiwan
businesses, particularly in low-tech, labor-intensive
industries, to invest in less-developed parts of Asia.
   For many, the best locale is Fujian, a coastal province of
28 million people. Although direct travel from Taiwan still
is barred, Taiwanese and Fujianese speak the Minnanhua
dialect, and most Taiwanese have local family connections
dating to 1949, when the Nationalist Chinese fled and set up
a government in Taipei.
   At Xiamen's Heping Ferry Pier one recent day, Wang Zhifang
is awaiting one of those relatives, a long-lost uncle. The
uncle had happened to be in Taiwan on business in 1949, when
the Nationalists broke off contact with the mainland. Family
reunions resumed just two years ago.
   When the uncle finally appears, arriving by boat from Hong
Kong, his elderly sister, separated from him for four
decades, rushes forward. The two shake hands politely, and
she quickly turns her attention to the loot he has lugged for
his poor relatives on the mainland: a refrigerator and a
color television set. The Wangs happily load their new
appliances into a pedicab and speed home with the uncle, who
will spend several weeks checking investment opportunities.
   Chinese statistics show that more than 500 Taiwanese
investors have plunked about $1 billion into Fujian. More
than half have set up shop just in the last year, producing
everything from shoes and sweaters to bicycles and
appliances. About 40 Taiwan business delegations arrive in
Fujian each day, officials say.
   Most of the investments are in Xiamen, a quiet island
enclave known in colonial times as Amoy. Three years ago,
Xiamen had 20 enterprises involving Taiwanese investment;
today it has 300. Now Taiwanese are snapping up Xiamen
property with the very unsocialist aim of land speculation.
   Chen Han-fu, the 41-year-old president of New Asia Jewelry
Co., is one of the fortune-hunters. He moved to Xiamen with
his family in 1987 to make seashell and jade trinkets. He was
one of the first Taiwan businessmen to come here, a daring
pioneer at a time when Taiwan's government still was trying
hard to bar such investments. Taiwan still hasn't legalized
them, but the ruling party has said it will introduce a law
permitting indirect investment, such as that by offshore
subsidiaries. Taiwan's own domestic economic concerns and the
surge in underground investments on the mainland have led
officials in Taipei to turn a blind eye.
   It was rising labor costs that drove Mr. Chen to Xiamen.
He shut his factory in Taiwan and shipped his equipment here.
He pays his 150 workers in Xiamen about $40 a month,
one-thirtieth his old cost.
   "In Taiwan I had to pay my driver $1,000 a month and he
still complained," says Mr. Chen. "Here I pay $25 and my
driver obeys my every command."
   Now that he has a beachhead, Mr. Chen will go for the big
money: in land development. Draftsmen sit in his offices
drawing up blueprints for a 22-story commercial building he
will build for other Taiwanese businessmen. The draftsmen
work for China's navy. "In China," he says with a smile, "if
you don't have connections, you're finished."
   Xiamen is a speculator's dream. Although socialist China
doesn't sell land, the local government will sell "land-use
rights" for periods up to 70 years. Purchasers can resell the
rights, even for exorbitant profits. Mr. Chen bought rights
to his development property three years ago for $64 a square
meter. Today it's worth $850 a meter and rising.
   Of course the bubble may someday burst. But Taiwanese
high-rollers think there's a long way to go first. Fueling
the bullishness is speculation that a man named Wang
Yung-ching is about to invest a fortune in Xiamen.
   Mr. Wang, the hugely rich founder of Taiwan's Formosa
Plastics Group empire, has traveled to the mainland several
times to discuss investing in a huge petrochemical plant.
Chinese officials say Mr. Wang has proposed sinking up to $7
billion into the venture, while the Chinese would invest $5
billion in infrastructure.
   The project, which is rumored to have the personal backing
of Chinese Premier Li Peng, is viewed as a key indicator of
Taiwan-China relations. If the investment proceeds, thousands
more Taiwanese companies will probably follow suit.
   Moreover, an investment by someone of the 73-year-old Mr.
Wang's stature might prod Taipei to lift its objection to
direct transportation links, investment and trade with the
mainland. But so far, the Taiwan government has fought to
stop the project, fearful that it might help prop up the
Communist government in China. Mr. Wang is intent on going
ahead with the plant, according to business associates.
   "A project like this could turn Xiamen into a world-class
oil center and provide employment opportunities for a million
people," says Chen Kong-li, director of the Taiwan Research
Institute in Xiamen. But he also cautions: "I'm not sure the
Chinese can come up with their $5 billion share."
   Until such a breakthrough comes, or until Taipei lifts its
restrictions, most Taiwanese investors in China are likely to
keep their heads down. Such caution creates unusual
situations. Taiwan's biggest company in Xiamen is a
well-known Taipei manufacturer that doesn't want its name
published, even though nearly everyone in Xiamen, including
visiting Taiwanese officials, is aware of its presence here.
   The rationale seems to be: Investors can skirt Taiwan's
law and invest in China as long as they aren't too obvious
about it. The company's manager, Liu Yuen-chi, will happily
talk about his business, but only if his firm's name isn't
mentioned.
   And so, Company "X" churns out toasters, irons and coffee
makers for well-known Japanese, European and U.S. brand-name
sellers. Last year, the factory's 700 workers produced $12
million worth of appliances. Even 1989's political upheaval
and Tiananmen Square massacre didn't damp business or the
company's resolve to stay. "We just kept working as usual,"
says Mr. Liu. "Taiwan people don't want to stir up things
politically here. If the mainland is in chaos, Taiwan will be
hurt as well."
   The entrepreneurs who live in Xiamen tend to stick
together. They meet at places like the Taiwan Sea Food
Restaurant, whose walls bear "Tong Ching Lions Club" banners
from Taiwan and an altar of three Buddhas-good-luck symbols
in Taiwan. After hours, the businessmen and their money
usually end up in places like the "karaoke" sing-along bar at
the Xiamen Mandarin Hotel. With a cover charge of $20, it's a
luxury few mainlanders can afford.
   Lai Yen-hsing is preparing to mount the small stage at the
bar to sing a Taiwan ditty about drinking. He is tipsy, as
are his companions. Mr. Lai recently set up a factory in
China to make noodles. After a few months here, he married a
local woman. But he isn't happy in Xiamen.
   "There isn't any freedom or democracy in China," he shouts
over the crooning of another Taiwan businessman, who has
begun slurring a rendition of the Beatles song "Yesterday."
"I came here to make money. But if I fail, no problem. I'll
just leave."
   Attitudes like this have unsettled many local people and
led to friction. The newcomers, they complain, care only
about cash. "These Taiwan guys come to the bar and say, `I
want the most expensive liquor you've got,'" says Zheng Long,
accounts manager for the Lujiang Hotel. "They don't care what
it is, just as long as they're paying a lot for it." So shop
owners jack up prices, and many people complain about
inflation fueled by the Taiwanese.
   But if relations are tense, the situation still is better
than in earlier times, when the two sides used to shell each
other across the strait. As a reminder of the bad old days,
the Chinese have left standing the remains of a
colonial-style office building that was shelled repeatedly by
the Taiwanese in 1958.
   Preserving the house, however, offers an inadvertent
propaganda victory to Taipei. For the half-destroyed,
crumbling building is home to three Chinese families --
assigned there by the cash-strapped local branch of the
Communist Party.
   Small wonder, then, that Party authorities are willing to
put up with some inconveniences to get at Taiwan's billions.
