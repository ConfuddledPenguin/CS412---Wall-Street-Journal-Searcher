   TAMPA, Fla. -- A federal grand jury returned indictments
against four employees of E-Systems Inc., alleging that the
men repeatedly falsified test results and other records
concerning the manufacture of U.S. Army field radios.
   "We are aware of the indictments," said a spokesman for
the Dallas-based defense contractor. "These employees are on
administrative leave. We can only extend to these employees
their constitutional guarantee of a presumption of
innocence." An investigation of the company continues.

   E-Systems closed its Memcor plant in Bushnell, Fla., in
1986 after the Army declared that the company was in default
on two contracts valued at $19 million and terminated the
contracts. E-Systems appealed, claiming $13 million in
damages. The criminal investigation arose from that dispute.
   The indictment alleges that three managers and a
supervisor at the Memcor plant ignored requirements to report
test failures and repairs on the Army field radios and
covertly created false documents on untested radios.
   The indictments charged the men with one count of
conspiracy to defraud the government and five counts of
making false claims. In a related case in January, Justice
Department attorneys won a conviction of Memcor production
supervisor Sadonna S. Hobbs for perjury. She was sentenced to
16 months in a federal correctional facility.
   E-Systems expects a speedy resolution of investigations, a
spokesman said.
   "The company is negotiating a complete resolution of all
matters pending," said Barbara Kittay, an attorney in the
Justice Department's fraud section.
   E-Systems announced a second-quarter after-tax charge of
$8.6 million to cover Memcor claims; the company expects no
further charges, the spokesman said.
   Charged in the indictment are Howard DeWight Rader, former
plant manager; Harley W. Hopson, former manager of quality
assurance; Houston Stanley Burke, former manager of test
production; and former quality assurance supervisor Paul R.
Preston Jr.
