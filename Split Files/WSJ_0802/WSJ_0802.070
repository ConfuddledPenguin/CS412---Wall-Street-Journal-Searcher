   NEW YORK -- Clayton &amp; Dubilier, in negotiating to buy
nearly $2.3 billion of low-end businesses from International
Business Machines Corp., is counting on bolder sales
strategies and a smaller work force to produce payoffs that
IBM couldn't achieve.
   The proposed transaction would be the biggest so far for
Clayton &amp; Dubilier, a 22-person financial boutique
specializing in leveraged buy-outs. The transaction involves
IBM's printer, typewriter, keyboard and office-supply
operations, both in the U.S. and Europe.

   "We want to grow the business," said Martin Dubilier,
chairman of Clayton &amp; Dubilier. One likely expansion area, he
said, will be in selling printers to other computer
companies, which can then market them under their own names.
Currently, IBM sells its increasingly popular $1,500 Laser
Printer only under its own name.
   "I've had calls from two major computer companies already,
wanting to know if we would consider supplying them," Mr.
Dubilier said yesterday. He declined to identify the
companies, but analysts said Digital Equipment Corp. and
Xerox Corp. are likely buyers of IBM printers and keyboards.
DEC officials declined comment; Xerox officials couldn't be
reached.
   Although IBM said it will shrink the work force of its
Information Products unit by 1,200 from its current 6,000,
Mr. Dubilier said the next move would be to hire salesmen. He
predicted that, concurrent with a buy-out, the low-end IBM
unit would hire a U.S. sales force of 200 to 250 people, and
a European sales force of another 200 people. These marketers
would sell products directly to independent computer
retailers -- a market segment in which IBM hasn't always
excelled. The low-end IBM operations don't currently have
their own specialized sales force; their products are
marketed by IBM's general sales force, which focuses on
selling more profitable large computer systems.
   Wall Street estimates are that Clayton &amp; Dubilier would
finance its buy-out with $500 million of equity, chiefly from
an institutional buy-out fund that Clayton &amp; Dubilier
controls. IBM would keep a 15% to 20% position in the
operation, while local management would get 15% ownership.
   The rest of the purchase price would be raised almost
entirely by bank debt. Units of Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. are
expected to be the lead lending banks.
   The transaction would leave the Information Products
business with about a 3.5-to-1 debt-equity ratio. That's far
more conservative than the heavily leveraged buy-outs of the
late 1980s, though still much more debt than would usually be
associated with an IBM venture.
   Several of Clayton &amp; Dubilier's longtime backers said they
were upbeat about the proposed IBM deal. "This is what
buy-out firms ought to be doing," said Scott Sperling, an
executive at Harvard University's endowment, which invests
with Clayton &amp; Dubilier. "They're taking a business that
isn't central to a big company but has good cash flow. Often
there are good opportunities for improved profits."
   Wall Street executives observed that IBM hadn't put its
low-end operations up for auction, seeking top dollar.
Instead, IBM appeared to have decided during private
negotiations last spring that it was most comfortable with
Clayton &amp; Dubilier as a buyer, even if it might mean passing
up a higher sales price.
   In its announcement yesterday, IBM reinforced the view
that non-money considerations had helped shape the deal. IBM
repeatedly talked about forming an "alliance" with Clayton &amp;
Dubilier, in which the new company would have "a set of
values very similar to those of IBM."
   One previous Clayton &amp; Dubilier buy-out -- the 1987
acquisition of the Nu-Kote office-forms division of
computer-maker Unisys Corp. -- may shed light on how the New
York firm would handle a low-end IBM acquisition. Nu-Kote's
sales have climbed about 10% a year since the buy-out.
   "I'm not hassled or overmanaged," Nu-Kote's president,
Hubbard Howe, said yesterday. "Clayton &amp; Dubilier's emphasis
is on building value, not wringing cash out of the business.
We have paid down bank loans, but that isn't the prime
objective."
   In fact, IBM lately has made rapid gains in selling
low-speed laser printers, one business it is spinning off.
IBM announced an impressive line of 10-page-per-minute
printers last year and some cheaper, five-page-per-minute
printers earlier this year. Infocorp, a market research firm
in Santa Clara, Calif., said IBM's share of that part of the
U.S. market has risen steadily through the year and surpassed
10% in June. That leaves IBM way behind Hewlett-Packard Co.,
which had a 77% market share in the first half. But analysts
expect IBM to keep boosting its share.
   Eventually, Mr. Dubilier said, "It's my dream to take this
company public." He wouldn't be pinned down on a timetable,
but typically leveraged buy-out companies have been sold in
some form after three to seven years.
