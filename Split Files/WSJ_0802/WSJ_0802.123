   UNUM Corp., an insurer based in Portland, Maine, said it
completed the final step of a British transaction by buying
certain policyholder interests of N.E.L. Permanent Health
Insurances Ltd., which is called Nelphi, for about $52
million.
   UNUM announced on July 2 the acquisition of N.E.L.'s
parent, National Employers' Life Assurance Co. of Dorking,
Surrey. UNUM then said certain policyholder interests of
Nelphi also would be purchased, following an independent
appraisal. Completion of the final part of the acquisition
brings the total purchase price of National Employers' Life,
its subsidiaries, related assets and policyholder interests,
to about $120 million.

insurance, which is comparable to long-term disability
insurance in the U.S. UNUM is the leading provider of group
long-term disability insurance in the U.S.
