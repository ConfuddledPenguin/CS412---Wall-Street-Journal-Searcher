   Investments in money market mutual funds hit a record
level in the latest week, after increasing for four weeks in
a row.
   Assets of 431 taxable funds totaled $385.4 billion, up
$587.4 million, at the close of business Tuesday, according
to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The total is $200
million above the previous record of $385.2 billion in the
week ended last March 27.

   Money fund assets continued to climb even as yields
continued to slip. The average seven-day compound yield,
which assumes reinvestment of dividends, dropped to 7.84%
from 7.88%.
   Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter, said the decline reflects the Federal Reserve's
recent easing of interest rates. But money funds continue to
draw deposits because their yields still beat those of
competing short-term investments, such as Treasury bills.
   Average maturity of the taxable funds remained the same in
the week ended Tuesday, at 44 days. That's within the range
of the last few months; average maturity has been as short as
29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years. Money funds
invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.56% from 7.59%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased, to 7.62% from 7.65% and the average 30-day
compound yield dropped to 7.91% from 7.94%
   Yields on tax-exempt funds were flat to down. The average
seven-day compound yield of 226 tax-free funds remained at
5.21%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is equivalent to
7.24% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and 7.78% for
someone paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of the tax-exempt funds decreased to $78.7 billion
from $78.8 billion. Average maturity remained at 51 days.
