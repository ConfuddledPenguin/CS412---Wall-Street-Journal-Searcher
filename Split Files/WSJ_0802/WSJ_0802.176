   Responding to your June 20 article "Hospitals Hire Revenue
Recovery Firms to Inflate Bills, Senate Panel Claims," I
suggest that the Senate panel is investigating the wrong
group. While I would agree that the "revenue recovery" firms
described are among the more unsavory elements involved in
hospital finance, these firms are used, to my knowledge, by
only a very small percentage of hospitals.
   On the other hand, I believe nearly every health insurer
has taken to using the "medical review" excuse as
justification to slow down payments. Any hospital that
refuses to cooperate with an audit by a health insurer is
only defeating itself, since the insurer will not pay the
bill until its audit "process" has been satisfied. Accounts
receivable in hospitals have risen dramatically in the past
few years, and these arbitrary "medical reviews" are a part
of the problem. There is, of course, a cost associated with
the necessary increase in working capital.

   I know of no reputable hospital that would refuse to
cooperate with an audit. In some cases it is necessary to
have a clinical professional (R.N., technologist, etc.)
participate in the audit to explain notations in the medical
record. In these cases, it may be appropriate for the insurer
to pay for the professionals' time lost from their scheduled
duties. Without such reimbursement, nearly every patient
account could be subject to groundless examination, all in
the name of preserving cash flow.
   Finally, if the Senate panel involved thinks shutting down
"revenue recovery" firms will add materially to an overall
solution of our health-care-cost crisis, the panel itself is
a part of the problem.
