   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry said he
expects increased company steel shipments and higher steel,
crude oil and natural gas prices in the second half of 1990.
   Separately, he disclosed that USX will become 20%-owner of
a 148-mile pipeline in the North Sea, which will transport
natural gas from the company's Brae fields to the United
Kingdom. Those fields contain an estimated 2.3 trillion cubic
feet of gas, of which USX owns about 900 billion cubic feet.

   Mr. Corry said USX's steel shipments in the second half
would reach about 5.8 million tons, or slightly more than the
5.5 million tons of steel it shipped in the first half. He
attributed the anticipated rise to stronger automotive orders
and strength in the tin-plate market.
   Industrywide shipments, he said, are expected to be about
83 million tons this year compared with about 84 million tons
in 1989. Steelmakers originally thought 1990 shipments would
reach only about 80 million tons.
   The company's steel business also should benefit from
stronger pricing. USX reported a 1% increase in steel prices
in the first half from year-earlier levels, but that slight
increase reflected a richer mix of products, rather than
higher average prices. Indeed, Mr. Corry noted that prices
drifted downward by about $10 to $12 a ton from January to
June, and that steel is selling at the same price as 10 years
ago, or an average of about $500 a ton.
   Prices should pick up in the second half, he said, as a
result of increases on certain steel products beginning with
July 1 shipments.
   In spite of a 48% decline in first-half steel operating
earnings, Mr. Corry said that USX's steel segment was well
positioned in its primary markets. The steel segment had
operating profit of $140 million on sales of $2.7 billion in
the first half.
   Regarding the possible sale of steel assets, Mr. Corry
said USX has had discussions with British Steel PLC but that
no specific proposal was made. As for other negotiations, Mr.
Corry would only say that a company the size of USX is always
in discussions but that nothing was "monumental."
   As for the energy segment, Mr. Corry noted that crude oil
prices averaged about $16 to $18 a barrel in the first half
and should increase in the second half. That would help the
company's upstream operations, which include exploration and
production. Natural-gas prices, which were hurt by a warm
first quarter, likewise should be better in the second half
with the beginning of cooler weather.
   Separately, Mr. Corry said talks with the United
Steelworkers of America regarding the Jan. 31, 1990, contract
expiration are scheduled to begin in December. The
negotiations are expected to be tough, given the company's
criticism of pacts signed by competitors last year and
reluctance to recognize any pattern contract.
   He said both the union and the company were hurt by a
strike in 1986. "That's not something I want to repeat," he
said. "I hope we approach new bargaining with new wisdom."
