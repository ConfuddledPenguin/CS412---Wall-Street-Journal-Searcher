   At the 1987 Washington summit, Soviet spokesman Georgi
Arbatov posed a rhetorical question: "What will you do when
we deny you an enemy?" Three years later, U.S. policymakers
seem to believe they are now confronting that problem.
   Several weeks ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee
completed work on a major defense bill that cancels or
severely cripples a number of important strategic programs.
On Tuesday, the House Armed Services Committee marked up a
defense bill that could do yet more damage to national
security. The trouble here is that no one is asking whether
the Soviets are merely denying us the perception of an enemy.
The Soviets may even be doing so in order to undermine the
American consensus for a strong defense. Soviet success in
any case shows that lawmakers' will to believe in Mikhail
Gorbachev's benign intentions is too strong.

   The U.S. Defense Department is, of course, certainly not
entitled to a blank check. Reasonable cuts in defense
spending are the necessary response to the world's changing
military and political situation, and to our own deficit
woes. But the Pentagon is not a cash cow to be milked to
nourish a bloated welfare state. Its mission is to safeguard
our freedom by keeping our military forces strong and ready.
   Take a look at history. Every time the U.S. has embarked
on a drastic unilateral reduction in military capability for
a short-term gain, the ultimate result has been a high cost
-- in American blood as well as treasure.
   We were woefully unprepared when we entered World War I.
Recruits drilled with broomsticks instead of rifles, and the
U.S. had to borrow artillery, tanks and aircraft from the
French and British. In the 1930s, isolationism gave us a weak
military. With Pearl Harbor, we learned the cost. U.S.
submarines went to war with torpedos that would not explode
on contact. Our aviators and their obsolete aircraft were
shot down in scores by Japanese pilots flying modern Zeros.
After World War II, the lesson repeated itself. The U.S.
demobilized precipitously and announced that it had no
security interest in East Asia. The result was the North
Korean invasion of South Korea 40 years ago this summer, and
the death of 50,000 Americans.
   Congress today is overlooking the high price of
unpreparedness in its zeal to spend the peace dividend --
before there is a dividend, and before there is true and
certain peace.
   The defense legislation pending in the House would
terminate the B-2 Stealth bomber program and stall the
modernization of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The
legislation in the Senate also stops modernization of ICBMs.
There is no strategic rationale for these steps. The process
that produced the legislation was not a thoughtful exercise
in defense policy analysis, but an accountant's exercise. The
very term "peace dividend" is the language of accountants. So
it should come as no surprise that Congress is acting with
little consideration of specific threats, strategic
imperatives or military requirements. The result is strategy
made by bookkeepers.
   The most glaring example of the triumph of short-term
politics over sound defense policy is the attitude toward
strategic programs, space and the Strategic Defense
Initiative. Even though the Warsaw Pact may no longer pose
the threat of conventional war for NATO, the Soviet threat at
the strategic end of the warfare spectrum remains real. The
Soviets are modernizing and expanding their nuclear arsenal.
Their military space program and their own "Star Wars" plans
continue unabated.
   Yet in Washington, the committee mark-up sessions and the
legislation that followed showed no concern over the use of
nuclear power for diplomatic leverage or blackmail. The
sessions have ignored the possibility that the Soviets are
merely following one of their old military doctrines:
"victory without war." One way to explain American failure to
aid Lithuania's freedom struggle -- morally or financially --
is that the U.S. is already intimidated by the Soviet nuclear
arsenal. Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, has made many speeches and issued many statements
explaining the Senate bill's strategy, but not one discusses
the critical importance of space to U.S. security and
prosperity -- an astonishing omission for any strategy that
claims to "look forward, not backward."
   In a trip to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
February, President Bush said, "In the 1990s, strategic
defense makes more sense than ever before." But the Senate
Armed Services Committee authorized nearly a billion dollars
less than the president's SDI request. The House Armed
Services Committee proposes to cut SDI by nearly $2 billion.
When the two chambers split the difference, the result could
be a major reduction in SDI funding, an actual decline in
real dollars, not merely a cut in the planned increase.
   There are worse prospects for SDI than reduced funding.
Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.) and Sen. Richard Shelby (D.,
Ala.) intend to offer an amendment to the Senate defense bill
that would radically restructure SDI. This comes at the
moment when the program stands on the threshold of producing
concrete benefits. By cutting $400 million from Phase I of
SDI and "brilliant pebbles," the most promising near-term
technology, the amendment would foreclose the deployment of
an actual defense system, and steer SDI toward long-term,
open-ended research. The senators would sacrifice the Defense
Department's freedom to manage the program efficiently, and
allocate the bulk of funds to established interests --
interests not coincidentally located in New Mexico and
Alabama.
   Sen. Nunn has predicted that a "broad national debate" on
strategic defense will result from this amendment. He's quite
right. The American people will have the chance to decide
whether they want SDI to become a technological welfare
program, or whether they want to get any return -- in the
form of an actual defense -- from the six years and nearly
$20 billion invested in SDI. They must decide through their
elected representatives whether to ensure by law that SDI
will never produce any real security and will instead become
merely another expensive entitlement program.
   Ironically, scientists and engineers working on SDI don't
favor pure research either. They, too, hope for a usable
product. In a recent report for the Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization, leading scientists from both Los
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories agree
that "Brilliant Pebbles offers effective and survivable
space-based means for addressing near- and long-term missile
threats in the boost phase."
   Building on the steady and dramatic technical progress to
date, and under the Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization's new director, Henry Cooper, there is the real
possibility that SDI funds will be spent to build the
protection that the American people think they have been
paying for all along -- unless Congress passes the
Bingaman-Shelby Amendment into law.
   If we turn our backs on SDI, we're not just rejecting the
option of defense against ballistic missiles. SDI also means
progress in the critical arena of space. It is significant
that the Senate defense bill would also terminate the MILSTAR
space-based command and control program, and that Sens. John
Kerry (D., Mass.) and Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) want to kill off
our anti-satellite capability as well.
   As long as there is conflict between competing interests
and ideologies, space will not be exempt from it. Indeed, we
are entering an era when space control is becoming the
crucial military leverage, and may determine the course of
future conflicts -- without a shot ever being fired by
terrestrial forces.
   Military forces have historically opened the way into new
frontiers of human endeavor, whether it was navies opening up
the high seas, or, as in our own history, the Army exploring
the new Western frontier, and providing security for
settlers, homesteaders and railroads.
   There is no reason the development of the space frontier
should not follow the same pattern. The military's initial
investment and sustained operations in space will push
technology forward, bring down the cost of launching and
keeping platforms in orbit, and provide the nucleus of future
settlements and commercial ventures. As in the past, "trade
will follow the flag."
   The first step toward the essential mastery of space is
SDI, the greatest technical and strategic innovation of the
past quarter century. A strategic defense system will greatly
reduce the military utility or blackmail potential of
nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. But SDI will give us more
than just a missile defense. It will also lead the way to
U.S. dominance in the ultimate high ground of space, and the
"high seas" of the future.
   The list of civil and commercial as well as military
benefits to be gained from space is endless. But the
investments will be, shall we say, astronomical. Can we
expect businesses to risk huge investments in space unless
their security is reasonably assured, unless U.S. interests
in space can be defended as they are on the earth's surface?
If congressional leaders, especially leaders of the armed
services committees, allow Congress to forestall the
immeasurable advantages of a space-based strategic defense,
then their pretensions to the role of strategist ring hollow.
   As Congress takes up action on the defense bill, the
American people need to remind their representatives that
American moral strength, political resolve, military
capability and technical prowess over the past 40 years have
brought us to the threshold of victory. When we are so close
to seeing the end of Soviet imperialism, the dividend ought
to be more than a transitory or illusory peace. By our
continued resolve, peace, when it comes, will be genuine and
lasting.
