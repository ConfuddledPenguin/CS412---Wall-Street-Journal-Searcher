   WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office said the
Justice Department doesn't have the kind of information
system its new financial-institutions fraud chief needs "to
effectively oversee and coordinate" the government's attack
on thrift and bank crimes.
   The GAO told the Senate Banking Committee it sees "strong
indications" that the department is "gearing up and deploying
resources for increased effort against financial-institution
fraud." But the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said
the department doesn't have a system to track bank and thrift
fraud cases, "how well the efforts are proceeding, what more
needs to be done, where it needs to be done, and what further
resources are actually needed.

   In fact, James Richmond, the department's special counsel
for financial-institution fraud, has expressed frustration
over his inability to provide precise statistics on the
status and number of major cases being handled by regional
U.S. attorneys' offices. Such information is crucial in
making decisions about where to send additional resources. In
general, the Justice Department has moved slowly toward
creating case-management systems, which use computers to
track the status of cases.
