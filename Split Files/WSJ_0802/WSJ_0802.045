   NEW YORK -- Prime Motor Inns Inc. shares have taken a
battering in the last two days, as the hotel company
continues to seek to reduce debt by selling assets.
   Prime Motor shares have fallen 23% since Monday, closing
down 50 cents at $5.125 a share in composite trading
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.

   The shares had closed at $6.625 a share on Monday.
   The Fairfield, N.J., company issued a statement at the Big
Board's request, saying there were no corporate developments
to account for the trading activity.
   A year ago, the company's shares were trading around $38 a
share. But it found itself facing a heavy debt load from
acquisitions as well as the inabililty of FCD Hospitality
Inc. to repay about $200 million of borrowings from Prime.
   Prime Motor yesterday said a bank credit agreement had
become effective, folding $60 million of unsecured loans into
a collateralized bank lending facility that matures next
March. The company said it has reduced bank debt to $110
million and its balance sheet restructuring is on schedule.
   Analysts noted there is a hefty short position in the
stock by investors who expect the price to go lower. Prime is
a $5 stock "partly because of concern about the quality of
earnings," as well as weak hotel space demand and a soft real
estate market, said Margo L. Vignola, an analyst with Salomon
Brothers Inc.
