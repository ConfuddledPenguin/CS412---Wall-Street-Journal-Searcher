   When you pull back from the particulars of daily
journalism, from the diet of new sensations fed up on the
morning and evening cycles, you begin to discern familiar
patterns. Disparate events and separate strands take on a
coherence that may be more apparent than real, but that at
least offer the possibility of intelligent response rather
than reflexive reaction. Think about the names Marion Barry,
David Duke, Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Helms and Jesse Jackson,
think about what each conjures up, then think again. It
helps, if only to put them in perspective.
   For the longest time now, it has been virtually impossible
to have a conversation in Washington, D.C., without talking
about Mayor Barry. The outcome of his trial will not change
that situation. In fact, it will probably exacerbate it.
While it would be a mistake to say that all reactions to the
man and his troubles are based on race, it would be true to
say that most whites think he is a charlatan and felon and
most blacks think he is a victim.

   For an even longer time, many white Democrats have
regarded Jesse Jackson with fascinated horror. They know they
don't like him, know that millions of voters essential to
Democratic Party success wildly admire him, and don't have a
clue about how to keep his supporters in the fold while
depriving him not only of the presidential nomination he
covets but also of veto power at the next national
convention. The mainstreamers say Mr. Jackson's race has
nothing to do with their concerns, except insofar as it is
obvious that what they regard as his demagoguery emits from a
black man. Vast numbers of his supporters are convinced
beyond the shadow of a doubt that Mr. Jackson's race is the
only reason he has been denied the nomination twice already.
   Louis Farrakhan, Nation of Islam leader and sometime buddy
of both Jesse Jackson and Marion Barry, preaches a brand of
carefully orchestrated anti-Semitism that carries the whiff
of the gas chamber for many American Jews, and many other
Americans who are not Jews as well. His admirers and
followers, some from within the black mainstream, tend to
concentrate on other features of his message. They dismiss
the charges of anti-Semitism as so many smokescreens designed
to obscure the validity of his indictments of white bigotry
and black dependency.
   Over in that journalistic corner reserved for what are
mistakenly considered regional phenomena, there is David Duke
of Louisiana. The born-again Louisiana politician, who was a
Ku Klux Klansman only yesterday and consorts with haters
today, has learned to package himself as a modern-day Huey
Long. Running for the U.S. Senate after winning an upset
election to the Louisiana legislature several years ago, he
offers a white populism tailored to the resentments of
working whites and the troubled middle class in a state whose
economy has been in recession for most of the past decade.
His racism is in code these days, but it's not hard to break.
His supporters think they've met the political Deliverer.
Some of his opponents profess to see in Duke a warning of
things to come, the failed beer hall putschtist re-emerging
as potent political leader.
   Finally, there is Jesse Helms, whose coded racism is no
less obvious than Mr. Duke's and whose uncoded segregationist
past is all laid out on the public record. The North Carolina
senator has far more real, rather than symbolic, power than
any of the others, but his core constituency is no less
alienated from mainstream America than theirs. Small-town
merchants, farmers, fundamental religionists affronted by the
erosion of old values in the nation's daily life, they
repeatedly place their hopes for political salvation in the
hands of a man whose economic positions are as damaging to
their actual interests as his rhetoric is reassuring to their
emotions.
   What all of these men have in common is that they aren't
going much further politically and were never going much
further politically. Each has a limited base. What they also
have in common is that all are able to pull the dominant
majority's chain with what is, for their followers,
satisfying ease. Nothing so validates their true believers'
faith than the rage and fear their champions seem to inspire.
   In the most basic sense, it hardly matters what objective
analyses Messrs. Farrakhan, Duke, Helms, Jackson or Barry
might reveal. Whether these men are wise or dumb -- and none
is dumb -- demagogues or saints, arrogant criminals or
persecuted prophets, each has tapped a deep well of grievance
and despair. Whatever the validity of their particular
messages, whatever their character defects, they fill a need
within disaffected communities that orthodox politicians have
left untouched.
   It is an old story in American politics. Racism has been a
constant in this heterogeneous society for two centuries.
Nativism has sparked new parties and regenerated Klans
repeatedly. Black nationalism as a reaction to white
oppression crests and falls with regularity. The politics of
paranoia has been practiced by men with Irish names, Anglo
names, black faces and red necks. Irrationalism apparently
comes with the territory.
   But words such as "paranoid," "racist" and "irrational"
make for better categorization than they do for solution. The
divides are made no more bridgeable when opposing forces line
up on either side to shake their fists and scream epithets.
It is the task of intelligent politics to separate the
legitimate from the unacceptable among the messages, to
confront the latter and redress the former. Behaving like
Chicken Little is no answer at all.
   Neither, however, is the tendency in several quarters to
try to adapt to the messengers, to rationalize the irrational
and explain away the unacceptable. It is nauseating to watch
intelligent black leaders making common cause with a
Farrakhan, or drawing careful distinctions to justify their
failure to repudiate his vile anti-Semitism. It is equally
unacceptable for a decent, thoughtful Republican such as Sen.
Nancy Kassenbaum to make a campaign spot for Jesse Helms, or
for several major corporations with reputations for social
concern to contribute big bucks to his library, revealing
cynical self-interest.
   What is needed is a political system that reflects the
legitimate concerns of the economically and culturally
dispossessed and tries to remedy them. There must be a
responsive hearing for those who believe their race or
beliefs or economic condition have rendered them irrelevant
in their own country. Instead of two parties fighting for the
same narrow middle ground, for the attention of the 50% of
adult Americans who are currently political participants,
there should be at least one party that will provide a home
and a megaphone for those who aren't making it and be a
mediating center for their competitive claims.
   Without one, the names will change and the faces will come
and go, but the disaffection, hatred and despair will remain,
ready to be tapped by new demagogues promising new forms of
salvation. Talking about Marion Barry or David Duke passes
the time, but it misses the point. Doing something about the
welling frustrations that such men represent and articulate
is the task at hand.
