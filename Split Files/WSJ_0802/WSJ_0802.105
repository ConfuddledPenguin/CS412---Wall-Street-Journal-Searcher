   McDonald's Corp., a frequent target of environmentalists,
has agreed to work with the Environmental Defense Fund to
reduce the tons of trash generated daily by the fast-food
chain's more than 11,000 restaurants world-wide.
   A task force of four officials each from the environmental
group and McDonald's will spend six months considering such
options as greater use of recycled material -- napkins and
Happy Meal boxes already are made of recycled paper -- as
well as the reduction of packaging and the use of reusable
utensils and cups.

   The aim is to reduce the chain's trash and set a standard
for others. "If McDonalds's can do innovative things to
redesign and reduce packaging materials, that will in itself
make a dent in the nation's solid waste problem and also
serve as an example to others," says Frederic Krupp, the
EDF's executive director.
   For McDonald's, getting the EDF's blessing could help mute
critics who regard it as a symbol of the disposable society.
McDonald's sells, and packages, hamburgers and other food for
22 million customers a day.
   The compact poses risks for both sides. Shelby Yastrow,
senior vice president and director of environmental affairs
for McDonald's, concedes that if the task force is unable to
agree on some issues, "that could be an embarrassment, if it
isn't handled right." At least for now, McDonald's, based in
Oak Brook, Ill., plans to continue to use polystyrene
plastic, a practice that has sparked efforts in some
communities to ban McDonald's packaging.
   Burger King says it has no plans to counter McDonald's
action. "We believe we have a great advantage," a spokeswoman
says, because the Grand Metropolitan PLC fast-food chain uses
only paper in its packaging, except for coffee cups.
   The Environmental Defense Fund risks criticism from fellow
environmentalists. "If we're unable to accomplish something,
I suppose some people will say `I told you so. You should
stick to litigation,'" Mr. Krupp says. But he insists: "There
are moments when it makes sense to see what mutual interest
we have with corporations." The environmental group won't be
paid for its efforts.
   Ralph Nader wasn't impressed. "Grass-roots environmental
groups aren't convinced that McDonald's is serious about
creating a better environment," he said.
   Mr. Yastrow says an early project for the task force might
be to examine the environmental consequences of a change
McDonald's is considering making in how it wraps a specific
product, which he wouldn't identify. The task force also will
be looking to see if McDonald's can make greater use of
material, such as unbleached paper, whose production and
disposal do less damage to the environment than materials
McDonald's currently uses. In addition, the group will look
at using McDonald's popular consumer appeal to promote
recycling generally. It also will examine using food wastes
and packaging for composting.
   The effort grew partly out of opposition to McDonald's
testing of on-site incineration of its waste at some outlets.
After being approached by EDF last year, McDonald's agreed to
abandon the project.
   Mr. Yastrow says he became interested in working with EDF
after appearing on a TV program last year with Mr. Krupp, who
had already contacted the company about working on the waste
issue. Even before then, however, the company had taken a
number of steps to reduce its contribution to the nation's
trash heap. In Brooklyn, N.Y., it collects used packaging
from schools and cafeterias as part of a recycling project.
Coca-Cola is now pumped from trucks into McDonald's tanks,
rather than being placed in interim packaging.
   Under the agreement signed yesterday, each side is free to
disagree with the recommendations of the task force or
interpret them differently. McDonald's can put all or some of
them them into place as it chooses. Either side can abandon
the project at any time if there proves to be little ground
for agreement.
