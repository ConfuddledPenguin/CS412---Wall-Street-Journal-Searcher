   Datron Systems Inc. said it has begun its previously
reported plan to buy back as many as 150,000, or about 5%, of
its common shares in the open market.
   Datron, a Simi Valley, Calif., maker of
satellite-communications systems and radio products, said the
shares would be held as treasury stock for use in stock
option and other incentive compensation plans.

   "At the current levels, we believe our stock is
undervalued," said David Derby, president and chief executive
officer. "While our first-quarter performance was below
expectations, we are highly confident about the company's
long-term growth prospects."
   Last week, Datron reported an 80% decline in fiscal
first-quarter net income to $170,000, or six cents a share,
from $866,000, or 28 cents a share. Sales in the period ended
June 30 fell 21% to $8.3 million from $10.6 million.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Datron closed
yesterday at $7, up 62.5 cents.
