   CITICORP (New York) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it
raised the ratings on Citibank N.A.'s Conduit Series 1986-1
and 1986-2 mortgage-backed securities to double-A from
double-A-minus. The rating affects $77.9 million of
certificates of the bank holding company's unit. S&amp;P said the
ratings were upgraded because appreciation of mortgaged
properties in California, combined with excellent performance
of the mortgage pool, resulted in strong credit quality for
the assets.
