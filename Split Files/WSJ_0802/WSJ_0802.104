   Eastman Kodak Co., benefiting sooner than expected from a
cost-savings program, reported second-quarter profit jumped
nearly fivefold after a big year-earlier charge.
   The earnings surge surprised some analysts, who increased
their full-year projections, and helped boost Kodak's
long-languishing stock. Analysts had criticized the company's
cost-cutting program as too little and too late. While
somewhat chastened, they question whether Kodak's moves into
pharmaceuticals and electronic imaging will pay off.

   Net was $384 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with $77
million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's
second quarter, however, included a $227 million
restructuring charge and was restated to reflect a 12-month
calendar year that went into effect in January, compared with
a 13-month period in 1989.
   Excluding the restructuring charge, net increased 26%.
Sales increased 2% to $4.87 billion from $4.77 billion.
   The increase in earnings exceeded both the company's
internal projections and analysts' forecasts. Analysts said
the benefits of the restructuring launched last year, which
included eliminating about 7,500 jobs, or about 5% of Kodak's
world-wide work force, kicked in at least a quarter earlier
than the company had expected.
   On that news, Kodak shares surged $4.25 apiece to close at
$42.375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Volume
was very heavy, with 3.9 million shares changing hands.
   B. Alex Henderson, of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
increased his rating on the stock to a buy from a hold, and
said he expects the company to earn more than $4 a share this
year, up from his previous estimate of $3.70 a share. Brenda
Lee Landry, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., also boosted
her full year estimate to $3.95 a share from $3.75.
   The Rochester, N.Y., photographic, pharmaceutical and
chemical concern said it expects continued improvement in its
earnings and "a strong second-half performance," but didn't
make a specific earnings projection.
   "The criticism of Kodak will die down for a while because
now things seem to be turning around," said Eugene Glazer, an
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, who has been recommending
the stock. But he says a key question is whether Kodak can
increase revenue in businesses such as pharmaceuticals and
electronic imaging while paring mature businesses.
   Mr. Glazer said increasing earnings through cost-cutting
probably won't increase Kodak's stock price over the longer
term because investors will expect to see improving results
from the company's new investments. "If top-line growth
doesn't come, then you'll see a resurfacing of concerns."
   Following last year's second quarter, when company profit
plunged 85%, the company embarked on a new round of
cost-cutting -- the fourth in six years. At the time, the
company said it would eliminate thousands of jobs and dispose
of or restructure 20 businesses with $1.25 billion in annual
sales. The program was designed to generate $1 billion in
operating savings in 1990.
   Previously Kodak came under fire because restructuring
efforts failed to boost earnings. In 1984, the company
restructured into smaller divisions to make them more
efficient. That wasn't enough, however, to avoid a 10%
work-force reduction and a 5% budget cut in 1986. And only
months before last year's second-quarter restructuring, the
company said it would slash costs for support services by 15%
by 1990.
   Since that time, Kodak has sold a number of businesses,
including its Verbatim unit, which made floppy disks, and
joint ventures. Looking forward, the company doesn't intend
to undertake any restructurings as bold as those initiated
last year, a company spokesman said.
   In the latest quarter, the company's film and paper
products had particularly strong showings, analysts said.
While operating profits at the company's chemical business
were off, analysts said they didn't fall as much as expected.
   Prudential-Bache's Mr. Henderson said profit margins at
the company's imaging segment "were way ahead of target." He
said that was the result of a reduced work force, modest
price increases, benefits from foreign currency translations
and improved productivity.
   For the six months, profit more than doubled to $583
million, or $1.80 a share, from restated net of $289 million,
or 89 cents a share a year earlier. Sales were roughly flat
at $8.98 billion.
