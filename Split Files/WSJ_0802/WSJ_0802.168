   Daisy Systems Corp., responding to growing creditor
pressure, said it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The filing, in San Jose, Calif., federal bankruptcy court,
responded to an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed in a
Denver court against the company by certain bondholders last
May.

   Daisy, once a leading maker of computer-aided engineering
systems, has been dogged for about a year by disappointing
sales as well as a crushing debt load associated with its
$200 million acquisition of Cadnetix Corp. last year. It said
it has about $40 million in secured debt and $73 million of
debentures outstanding.
   Daisy, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it hopes to
implement a restructuring that includes a "substantial"
reduction in its U.S. operations and work force.
   It added that it hired McGettigan, Wick &amp; Co., a San
Francisco investment banking firm, to explore an eventual
sale of the company or its remaining assets.
