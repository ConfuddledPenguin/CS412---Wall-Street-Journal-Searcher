   Jordan, Mont. -- It was 7:20 when we drove into this
sultry plains town on a silent Sunday night. Storm clouds
gathered across the immensity of sky. The thermometer on the
bank registered 100 degrees.
   Jordan is the last town between Bozeman and the site, 55
miles away, where a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the large carnivorous
dinosaur, recently was found. Paleontologists from Bozeman's
Museum of the Rockies had been out there digging for a month.
Between Jordan and the site there is nothing but sagebrush,
badlands and a phone booth, just standing alone in the
biggest land I ever saw.

   The site lies within the Charles M. Russell National
Wildlife Refuge, where more than a million acres of badlands,
prairie, juniper stands, ponderosa pine forests and rich
river bottomlands provide habitat for a variety of wildlife.
The refuge extends along the Missouri River and the reservoir
formed by the Fort Peck Dam, the world's largest
hydraulically earth-filled dam. There are elk and badger,
deer, bobcat and 236 species of birds. Camped along the river
one night, we watched half a dozen beaver nibble grass, lie
around on the beach and go for an occasional swim.
   T. Rex rested in the badlands, a country of dry, high,
rounded hills built of sandstone, mudstone, layers of coal,
clay, shale and other variations of earth. Tamarisk and
rabbit brush grow here, and foxtail barley rippling in wind
like a sand-colored sea. The soil -- bearpaw shale -- is a
hard gray mud that turns oil slick after a rain. Vehicles
just slide down it. If it rains, you stay put until the sun
has dried the earth.
   Minutes after we arrived at camp a storm hit. Wind blew
sand into our eyes, flattened tents and brought a squalling
rain. We (museum photographer Bruce Selyem and I) and five of
the six bone-diggers still in camp huddled under the tarp
roofing the kitchen. The tarp leaked, but the company was
comforting. "This is a hard place," one of the crew said. "A
hundred and four degrees during the day and every night a
storm." Two toads hopped through a puddle just beyond us,
apparently rising spontaneously out of the desert, now that
there was rain.
   They were tired, these six who were left. Chief Preparator
Pat Leiggi, Bob Harmon and Allison Gentry had been there all
month, the others long enough to have had enough. Under a hot
sun in a country with no trees, it is tedious, painstaking
work, this business of freeing bones from an earth that has
held them millions of years. Even views of an arm of the
reservoir don't help. Surrounded by mud, it flows muddy and
slow, 30 feet below normal level, the result of a drought
that has lasted too long, and the politics of water released
for navigation far downstream.
   But they were excited too. They had uncovered the most
complete T. Rex ever found. Eighty-five to 90% of it is
present. (Other T. Rexes are 50% complete at the most.) This
dinosaur, found curled up on its left side, probably was
buried quickly so that its bones were not taken by animals,
washed away by rivers or eroded by time. It also is the first
Montana T. Rex to stay in the state. T. Rex was going on a
trip, but he wasn't leaving home.
   On Labor Day 1988, area ranchers Kathy and Tom Wankel were
out prospecting when Kathy noticed some slim bones jutting
from a hillside. "I knew there were a lot here," she told me.
"And I thought, why can't I find one? I never dreamed I'd
find a whole dinosaur]" At Thanksgiving they took the bones
to the Museum of the Rockies, home base for Jack Horner, one
of the world's foremost dinosaur authorities. In May 1989,
Kathy and Tom brought the museum paleontologists to the site.
   The Wankels arrived in camp Monday morning to take leave
of their dinosaur. So did the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and Bill McKamey of Willimac Trucking in Great Falls. Mr.
McKamey had volunteered his flat-bed semi to carry T. Rex the
370 miles to Bozeman. "How many chances do you get in your
life to haul a dinosaur?" he explained. Jim Alphonso,
assistant manager of the CMR Refuge, appeared, escorting
three gray-haired ladies from the town of Circle up the
still-slippery hill. The historian among them, Polly
Wischmann, said to me, "I don t really like it leaving, but a
lot more people will see it in Bozeman."
   The bones had been encased in a plaster-burlap wrap to
stabilize them, and the smaller ones had already been taken
down the hill. The two largest pieces, the cervical vertebrae
where the head and shoulders attach, and the pelvis, still
were in the pit. To remove them, a front-end loader and a
tilt-bed truck were provided by the Corps of Engineers, whose
usual duties here consist of building and maintaining the
dam, recreation sites and boat docks. Tom Wankel's flat-bed
farm truck was parked near the hill. Because the road
specially built by the Corps to get T. Rex out was impassable
by the semi, the two smaller trucks would transport the
dinosaur to it.
   Front-end loader operator Walt Murch manipulated that
large machine with infinite finesse, lifting the cervical
vertebrae cast so that timbers could be placed underneath,
giving the paleontologists room to work as they plastered the
bottom holes. Once the plaster was set, the front-end loader
gently placed it atop a wooden pallet around which the
loader's straps were wrapped and hooked onto the loader's
bucket. The bucket rose. The straps grew taut. The pallet was
lifted, and the loader maneuvered into a turn. Its huge
wheels skidded on the slimy mud as the loader carried its
large white bundle down the short but steep hill to the
truck. "One down," said Ed West, the Corps maintenance
foreman.
   I asked Mr. Murch what it felt like to be lifting dinosaur
bones. "Just like any other old rock," he said, smiling. "We
probably move them around all the time and don't even know
it."
   By noon work began on the largest piece, the huge section
of pelvic bones. When the loader attempted to carry it to the
truck it clearly was too heavy. Normally, the bucket can
handle about 8,000 pounds. This piece weighed 6,500 pounds,
but because the bucket was being used to lift rather than
carry, the balance was out of whack and the cast could not be
lifted high enough. Returned to place, the weight of it
pulled the back wheels of the front-end loader off the
ground, giving us some slight sense of T. Rex's power. The
situation was remedied by bringing the truck up the hill,
then placing it below the loader. The truck bed extended and
tilted and the two machines working delicately together got
the dinosaur onto the truck.
   Among the smaller pieces moved onto Tom's truck was part
of a Triceratops skull and horns. Triceratops are common
here. T. Rex ate them.
   The transfer of the bones to the semi was done a few miles
away. By the time all the pieces were in place and secured to
the truck it was almost 7 p.m. The sky had grayed. Rows of
lightning jagged across it in the distance. The men fought a
rising wind to tighten tarps across part of the load. In this
prelude to storm, the smell of sage was strong. A meadowlark
sang, its song swelling over the whirring motor of the semi.
The first drops of rain fell. And everything was ready. Pat
Leiggi climbed into the cab next to Bill McKamey and, after
65 million years, T. Rex took off down the road to Bozeman in
a cream-colored Kenworth.
   Visitors to the Museum of the Rockies will be able to
watch work on T. Rex for the next two or three years. For
