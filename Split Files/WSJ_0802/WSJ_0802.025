   STOCKHOLM -- Share prices on the Oslo Stock Exchange
surged to a third consecutive record close this week, fueled
by prospects of higher oil and metal prices, as well as
Norway's brightening domestic economy.
   While markets elsewhere in Scandinavia barely began to
stir from summer vacation doldrums, Oslo erupted with a
flurry of trading. The all-share index on Monday jumped 5.55
points to 652.5, eclipsing the record set in mid-March. The
index added 7.4 points on Tuesday and 4.88 points yesterday
to close at 664.78. This represents a three-day spurt of 2.9%
and leaves the Oslo index up 26.7% for the year.

   Market analysts have been anticipating an autumn rally,
because of positive economic indicators such as dwindling
inflation and interest rates, as well as a likely buying
binge by institutional investors, but many have been
surprised by the speed of this week's gains. The rally
rekindled bullish sentiment that prevailed earlier in the
year: In the first six weeks, Oslo's index climbed 11%, after
soaring 54% in 1989.
   Last week's agreement by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, aimed at boosting the price of crude
oil, triggered the surge in Oslo's equity prices, market
analysts said. "Almost all shares quoted on the Oslo market
are oil or shipping related, and have benefited from the
increase in oil prices," DnB Securities' chief equity
analyst, Sigmund Ellingboe, said. "Foreign investors, who
often use the Oslo market as a way to diversify into oil or
shipping investments, have been a key factor in this week's
rally."
