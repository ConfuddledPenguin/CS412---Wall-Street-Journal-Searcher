   MACKENZIE FINANCIAL Corp. said it agreed to issue three
million special warrants to a group of Toronto investment
dealers for total proceeds of 23.3 million Canadian dollars
(US$20.2 million). The warrants will be distributed by
private placement, Mackenzie Financial said, and will entitle
the holder to acquire one common share of the company for no
additional payment. The warrant issue is subject to
regulatory approval. Mackenzie Financial, a Toronto-based
mutual funds concern, said the issue is expected to close
around the end of August. The group of investment dealers
includes Gordon Capital Corp., Midland Walwyn Inc. and Wood
Gundy Inc. In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange
yesterday, Mackenzie Financial shares closed at C$7.88, down
50 Canadian cents.
