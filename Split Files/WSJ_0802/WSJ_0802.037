   DETROIT'S BUILDING 'EM but who's buying?
   Auto makers boost production in hopes of higher
second-half sales, but sharp price hikes may deter buyers.
After cutting output by 14% in the first half, car makers
(including Japanese who build in the U.S.) schedule a 10%
increase for the third quarter. The Big Three insist they
don't anticipate a UAW strike in September. Instead, they
note first-half cuts simply returned bulging inventories to
normal, making it possible to boost output now. Still,
second-half industrywide sales "will go up very modestly,"
says Ford's David N. McCammon.

   Ford predicts an annual sales rate of 14.6 million
vehicles in the current half, up a bit from the first half's
14.3 million pace. But sticker shock could jolt consumers.
Chrysler may boost minivan prices as much as 12%, and Ford
wants to hike the price of the least expensive Taurus by
$1,077, or 8.5%. The Japanese, who took a record 28% of car
sales in the first half, could benefit. Although the dollar's
been sliding, it's still stronger against the yen than at the
start of the year. So, advantage: Japanese, in pricing
flexibility.
   Autos, which account for about 5% of GNP, bedevil economic
forecasters who try to decipher demand.
                                                                                                       

   GATOR RAIDING'S on the mind of Coke, Pepsi. So far, they
only take sips.
   Quaker's Gatorade guzzled 96% of the $475 million "energy
drink" market last year, says David Weiss of Packaged Facts,
New York. But now Pepsi's a contender with lightly carbonated
Mountain Dew Sport. Coke competes in a special arena, selling
PowerAde only at convenience store fountains. Coke's
non-carbonated drink in lemon, fruit punch and orange flavors
"targets primarily males" who do physical labor or exercise,
says a spokesman. Quaker extends the line with women in mind,
offering low-calorie Gatorade this spring.
   The stakes are high. Packaged Facts expects sales of
sports beverages to grow about 15% annually, reaching $1.1
billion by 1995. Do they work? A recent Medical Letter item
on heat injury notes runners should drink 100-300 milliliters
(about 250 is a cup) of water, or a solution like Gatorade,
10 to 15 minutes before a race and a cup or so every three to
four kilometers. Yes, it's OK to drink during exercise. Note:
the letter indicates water is a quite acceptable drink to
replace fluids lost during strenuous exercise.
                                                                                                       

   SURETY BOND SQUEEZE hurts many small and minority-owned
contractors.
   New federal rules crack down on inadequately financed
entrepreneurs who back construction bonds. But the change
dries up a key source of performance and payment bonds for
many firms that can't meet big insurers' standards.
Minority-owned firms, like Marenco Inc. of Anchorage, Alaska,
are especially hard hit. "It's been like a pail of cold
water," says Jose Angel Marks Cisneros, president. Last year,
his firm won $2.5 million in contracts. This year? Less than
$150,000. Comstock Construction, Evanston, Ill., lays off 50
workers. "There's no sense in bidding on anything" bonded,
says President Edgar Garcia-Smoot.
   Eyeing opportunity, big insurers offer bonds to small
builders -- at premiums double or triple rates paid by big
contractors. Meanwhile, support mounts in Washington to
rebuild the individual-surety industry. One proposed bill now
in committee would create federally approved "risk pools,"
which would broaden access to bonds while weeding out
undercapitalized individuals.
   Surety bonds are required on most government work. More
private firms and homeowners demand them, too.
                                                                                                       

   STOP THIEF] Knogo Corp., Hauppauge, N.Y., installs
anti-theft tags for computers, fax machines and the like in a
New York office building. The tags, which are similar to
those mashed onto garments to prevent shoplifting, are placed
inside machines.
                                                                                                       

   READ IT ON THE TRAIN. Some 64% of top executives surveyed
for IMRS Inc., a Stamford, Conn., software firm, say they
prefer reports on paper, not via computer.
                                                                                                       

   NEW KID ON THE BLOC, "Tracking Eastern Europe," a weekly
newsletter from A.M.F. International, plans to focus on
business developments in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
First issue's due next week.
                                                                                                       

   MALAISE ON MAIN STREET. Downtown retailers combat
difficult odds.
   Even the most affluent small towns and suburbs are
affected. "America is overstored today," says Marvin
Blumenfeld of April-Blumenfeld Co., a consulting firm. On
Main Street "merchants are small and have a tendency not to
cooperate with each other," says Mr. Blumenfeld. That can add
to problems in a troubled industry. Statistics are hard to
come by, but the credit crunch is thought to exacerbate
vacancy rates in small downtowns. Meanwhile, malls can offer
"deals" such as $100,000 for inventory, or several months'
free rent.
   Stan Cohn, manager of retail services for Cushman &amp;
Wakefield in San Francisco, says time takes its toll, too.
"The buildings are functionally obsolete" for modern
retailing, he says. Bright spots: the Downtown Idea Exchange
cites day care centers, joint merchant plans, specialty
shops.
   Utica, N.Y., buys a classic Woolworth building to convert
and lease as office space to keep a big employer.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: This year marks the 25th anniversary of the
