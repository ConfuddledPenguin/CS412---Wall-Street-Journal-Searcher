   NEW YORK -- If you listen closely, you'll hear a faint
hissing coming from the stock market. It's the sound of air
escaping from growth stocks.
   While investors have focused on the almost daily casualty
list of stocks that plunged after reporting disappointing
earnings, a broader erosion has occurred. Many other
once-highflying growth stocks have suffered slow leaks,
steadily sinking on significant volume.

   Stocks such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have fallen between
15% and 20% within the last three weeks without any negative
surprises. Microsoft and Circus Circus Enterprises have each
fallen more than 10% in the same period, apparently because
of comments from management or Wall Street analysts that were
only mildly negative.
   And yesterday Boeing and Procter &amp; Gamble -- two of the
market's biggest growth stocks, which are generally defined
as companies that are expected to report rapidly increasing
earnings -- each fell more than a dollar a share without any
specific negative news.
   Several market strategists and growth-stock analysts say
the slow leaks have been caused by fears that if McDonald's
or Lotus Development can report disappointing sales or
earnings, then so might other growth companies.
   "There has been a tendency, particularly in the last two
weeks, to do a little profit-taking in the winners whether
there was a disappointment or not," says Robert J. Farrell,
chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It started when we
had some of the breaks begin to appear in the technology
stocks and McDonald's."
   Says Eldon Mayer, chairman of Lynch &amp; Mayer, a
growth-stock oriented money managment firm: "People are
saying, `I got zapped on my United Telecommunications' and my
Sallie Mae, so I'm getting nervous about my Wal-Mart.'"
United Telecommnications' stock has fallen 36% since it
reported a 55% drop in second-quarter net income; the stock
of Sallie Mae, or Student Loan Marketing Association, has
fallen about 20% in the past two weeks because of its
potential exposure to a financially troubled student-loan
guarantee organization.
   Market strategists and growth-stock followers are nearly
unanimous about one implication of the price weakness among
otherwise untarnished growth stocks: It is yet another sign
of the narrowing of stock-market leadership.
   In other words, although the stock market is still just
100 points shy of its all-time high as measured by the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, its advance is being led by a
now-dwindling group of darling stocks. That narrowness, or
lack of "breadth," as the market technicians call it, usually
is viewed as a sign of a weak market, vulnerable to
practically any shock of negative news.
   For a while, Mr. Mayer says, stock-market bulls had argued
that the market's narrow leadership wasn't necessarily a bad
sign, because the rest of the market would soon catch up with
the few dozen stocks that tend to drive the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index.
The bears, of course, argued that it was only a matter of
time before the leaders would fall back to join the market's
rank and file in the doldrums.
   "It definitely feels to us as though the jury's verdict
has been delivered," Mr. Mayer says. "Until further notice,
the leadership of the market is in a narrowing phase, and
that has to be bad news to investors in general. The hope of
the market breadth improving is pretty much dashed now."
   "This is a market that is only interested in a narrow
group of growth stocks," says Steven Einhorn, portfolio
strategist at Goldman, Sachs. "That is a market that doesn't
have a healthy foundation, which is a market that is
vulnerable. This is a market that will not prove to be
rewarding relative to bonds or relative to cash." As a
result, Mr. Einhorn is recommending that balanced accounts
remain only 50% invested in stocks, with 40% in long-duration
bonds and 10% in cash.
   "Those stocks that keep their earnings intact will
outperform the market on a relative basis," Mr. Einhorn says.
"From here, the problem is likely to be that there will be
fewer and fewer that keep their record intact."
   Other strategists offer different interpretations of the
current sag in growth stocks. Some call it merely a temporary
correction, a natural consequence of the rapid run-up in
growth stocks this year.
   L. Keith Mullins, head of the growth-stock research group
at Morgan Stanley, notes that his firm's index of emerging
growth stocks gained 26% from the end of January to the end
of July, while the S&amp;P 500 rose only 8.2% during the same
period. "I think that any advance of that magnitude should be
followed by the magnitude of a 10% to 15% correction," Mr.
Mullins says.
   Such a decline, however, should be healthy for the broader
market, Mr. Mullins says, because he believes growth stocks
will then lead another market advance.
   Mr. Mullins argues that the minicrash of last Oct. 13,
sparked by the failure to obtain financing for a UAL buy-out,
was a turning point. Investors suddenly soured on buy-out
candidates and cash-flow analysis, refocusing instead on
corporate earnings.
   "It took from 1981 to 1989 for the market to get that
focus on cash-flow analysis," Mr. Mullins says. "It's going
to take several years to unravel that process, and it won't
be a straight line."
   However, Mr. Mullins expressed confidence that investors
haven't lost their taste for growth and begun a shift into
cyclical stocks, whose earnings tend to rise and fall with
the ups and downs of the national economy. "At this stage, I
don't think there's any evidence that the fundamental shift
that occurred in the market last October has changed. If you
do believe that, you buy on weakness here."
   Mr. Mayer agrees that the growth-stock enthusiasm of the
past few months "is not being replaced by a rotation." He
says that longer-term investors, who are willing to wait two
or three years for their profits, shouldn't be worried by
recent growth-stock weakness.
   "I don't think you can make the case that these stocks are
grossly overpriced," says Mr. Mayer, who points out that
growth stocks today are trading at far lower multiples of
their per-share earnings than growth stocks were at the
1972-73 market top.
   Mr. Farrell of Merrill Lynch slices the growth-stock pie a
bit differently, pointing out that investors seem to be
punishing growth companies whose earnings are heavily
dependent on the U.S. domestic economy, such as Wal-Mart,
while remaining enthusiastic about drug companies, which draw
a substantial portion of their earnings from sales abroad.
The reason, Mr. Farrell suggests, is the increasing fear of a
recession in the U.S., combined with a declining U.S. dollar,
which makes sales in other currencies more valuable to U.S.
companies.
   Mr. Farrell doesn't see a stampede out of growth stocks,
but does believe there has been some rotation. He says
several growth-stock managers he talks to have moved money
into energy stocks, which have been rising along with oil
prices, and General Electric.
   To Mr. Mayer, a purchase of GE wouldn't represent a switch
out of growth stocks. Despite GE's huge size, Mr. Mayer
includes it on his short list of growth favorites.
