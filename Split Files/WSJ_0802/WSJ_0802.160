   WASHINGTON -- Looking for an ethical facelift before the
November elections, the Senate voted to overhaul the system
of financing congressional elections, including a ban on
honorariums, the controversial outside speaking fees that
many lawmakers use to pad their salaries.
   Splitting along partisan lines in a 59-40 vote, the Senate
approved a package of reforms sponsored by the Democrats. The
bill limits the amount of money congressional candidates can
spend on their general election campaigns, ranging from
$950,000 to $5 million depending on the size of the states;
bans political action committees; and, for the first time,
provides taxpayer subsidies for certain campaign costs such
as television air time and postage.

   Republicans are staunchly opposed to spending limits and
any use of public funds for congressional campaigns. Sen.
Mitch McConnell, who led the GOP opposition, said President
Bush was certain to veto the measure, which the Kentucky
Republican blasted as "a food-stamp program for politicians."
GOP senators were confident they could sustain a veto.
   The honorarium ban contained in the bill would take effect
next January. The bill also would limit senators' outside
earnings, including investments, to 15% of their $98,400
annual salaries. Senators may now accept as much as $39,360
annually in honorariums, equal to 40% of their salary.
   Last year, the House voted to ban outside speaking fees
beginning next January in exchange for a politically
controversial pay raise. The Senate rejected a pay raise, but
left the honorarium system intact.
   The outlook for campaign finance legislation in the House
is uncertain. While the leadership hopes to take up a bill
tomorrow, Democrats are still deeply divided over fundamental
issues such as spending limits and restricting PACs.
   Still, advocates of campaign finance overhaul, who have
been stymied since 1974, were encouraged by the Senate's
action. "We will have made huge progress," said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the citizens' lobby.
"The handwriting is on the wall for the end of the honoraria
system," he added.
