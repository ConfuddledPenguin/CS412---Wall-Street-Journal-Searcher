   Despite the addition of $40.5 million in July gambling
revenue from the new Trump Taj Mahal, the Atlantic City
casino industry saw a growth of only 0.7% last month compared
with a year earlier. The preliminary July results, released
by the Casino Association of New Jersey, wiped out hopes that
the Taj would permanently increase the size of the gambling
market.
   "The market is dead flat and the overall industry in New
Jersey is struggling," acknowledged Thomas Carver, president
of the association.

   Revenue at the Trump Castle plunged 28% from a year ago to
$21.4 million, the steepest decline among the city's 12
casinos; the Trump Plaza's revenue dropped almost 24% to
$23.4 million. These sharp drops suggest that the Taj
continues to cannibalize Trump's other gambling properties.
   Elsewhere in city, revenue at Bally's Grand dropped 20% to
$18.5 million; Harrah's plunged 17% to $24.2 million;
Tropworld fell 16% to $26.5 million; Resorts was down 12% to
$21.2 million; Bally's Park Place dropped 11% to $25.7
million; the Showboat's revenue fell 7.8% to $23.6 million;
and Caesars slipped 6.8% to $30.5 million.
   The only casinos to register increases were the Claridge,
where revenue jumped 13% to $13.3 million, and the Sands,
where revenue edged up 2% to $21.6 million.
   "We are very discouraged by the less than 1% growth in
casino gross revenues," said Mr. Carver, adding: "The
decrease in gross revenues for most casinos coupled with
increased operating expenses spells double trouble."
   Pointing out that the association's July figures were
based on projections from actual revenue through July 28, Al
Glasgow, a gambling industry consultant, predicted that when
the final July figures are tabulated, the industry will show
either flat revenue or a slight decline.
