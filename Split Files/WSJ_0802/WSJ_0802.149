   The accounting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche will "vigorously"
defend itself against a lawsuit filed in connection with its
work as auditor of the failed FirstSouth Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Pine Bluff, Ark., a spokeswoman for the firm
said.
   The suit, filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
last week in federal court in Little Rock, Ark., seeks a
minimum of $400 million in damages from the accounting firm
for allegedly faulty audits performed by one of its
predecessors, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells.

   Deloitte Haskins, which merged last December with Touche
Ross &amp; Co., had performed audits of FirstSouth's books in
1983, 1984 and 1985.
   The suit specifically accuses Deloitte of ignoring
"grossly deficient underwriting" of loans and letters of
credit at the thrift; of failing to recognize that the thrift
was delaying the recording of losses on nonperforming loans
by "parking" the loans with insiders; and of failing to
detect violations of federal limits on loans to one borrower.
   The new lawsuit against Deloitte is the most recent of the
government's aggressive efforts to recoup some of its losses
from the failure of FirstSouth. Last year, the government
obtained $27.6 million through separate settlements with
FirstSouth's former law firm, the thrift's officers and
directors and a now-disbanded Dallas mortgage brokerage firm
that had placed several loans with the thrift.
