   MACDERMID Inc. (Waterbury, Conn.) -- Daniel H. Leever was
named president and chief operating officer, and Arthur J.
LoVetere was named vice chairman. The company, which makes
and markets specialty chemicals, said Mr. Leever most
recently was senior vice president and chief operating
officer. Mr. LoVetere, who expects to be ordained a permanent
deacon in the Roman Catholic Church next year, intends to
retire in 1995 after 35 years of service, MacDermid said.
