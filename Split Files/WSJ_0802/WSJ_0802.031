   Saturday, Aug. 4, 3:05 p.m.-6:05 p.m. and 8 p.m.-1:05 a.m.
EDT, on TBS: Last weekend of the Goodwill Games. Saturday
competitions include gold-medal boxing; women's basketball
and hockey semifinals. Finals in women's figure skating and
men's volleyball in the evening. Sunday, 3:05 p.m.-6:05 p.m.:
Women's basketball, hockey and boxing finals. 8:05 p.m.-1:05
a.m. More boxing finals, judo, closing ceremonies. Caution:
If Montgomery Clift or some other film star appears on your
screen instead of the above-mentioned gymkhana, it's because
some cable systems, truckling to the public's demonstrable
lack of interest in sports as geopolitical sermon, will be
airing movies instead of the games.

   Sunday, Aug. 5, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Arts &amp; Entertainment:
"Crew of the Enola Gay." A return to Hiroshima with some of
the air crew who dropped the bomb in August of 1945. Jaunty
men in their late 60s and 70s, the visitors are anxious and
awestruck as they arrive. Still, the very British narrator
has trouble concealing a note of supercilious distaste for
these Air Force veterans who calmly swallow dinner and talk
quietly among themselves and who clearly are, in the
narrator's view, insufficiently guilt-ridden. The narrator
problem aside, there is much here that is rivetingly
complicated as the unfailingly gracious Japanese welcome
these Americans. If nothing else this would be worth seeing
for the exchange between the veterans and some survivors of
radiation sickness, both for what is said and the infinite
suggestiveness of what is left unsaid.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Aug. 6, 8-9 pm EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary so check local listings): "Wild Man of China."
Alleged sightings of a half-human, apelike creature tempt two
American anthropologists on a journey through central China.
The trip is an education in a number of ways. One learns
something about medical standards in the People's Republic of
China, when an explorer needing medical treatment tries to
get a hospital doctor to see the wisdom of using a clean
hypodermic needle. But the trip up, or perhaps it is down,
the Yangtze to look for Wild Man, as he is fondly known, is
enchanting because Wild Man (said by one and all villagers to
have long red hair) clearly has picked a splendid part of
China to haunt. The scenes in the marketplaces and the
closeups of the townspeople who have never before seen
Westerners, are memorable. Wild Man is never found,
fortunately for him, and the 2,000-year-old hunt goes on.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Aug. 8, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Castro's Cuba:
Two Views." Two views indeed. One is from Cuban exile and
photography director Nestor Almendros ("Kramer vs. Kramer,"
"Sophie's Choice") and journalist Jorge Ulla. It shows
witness after witness to the torture and decades of
imprisonment Castro visited on dissidents. That torture took
place, they remind us, while progressive intellectuals and
literary types in the U.S. and elsewhere busied themselves
celebrating Castro, hence the title, "Nobody Listened." The
other film, "Uncompromising Revolution," is a worshipful
portrait of Castro's Cuba put together by Saul Landau of the
Institute for Policy Studies. In it we are privileged to see
pictures of baby Fidel, Fidel at school, and also pictures
galore of singing and happy Cubans. Indeed the film is cast
mainly with smiling and happy Cubans and happy children
singing, as happy livestock wander by. The Maximum Leader
himself also is merry. No viewer comparing this work with
Messrs. Almendros and Ulla's detailed documentation of horror
will have any trouble deciding which has the ring of truth.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Aug. 8, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Top Cops," a
superior documentary series about police, the appeal of which
derives from a good ear, unsensational re-enactments, and a
lack of pretension. Its creators appear to be aware that when
extraordinary experiences of ordinary people, like policemen,
are rendered in the way that those ordinary people actually
talk, the result can be powerful. A cop program in which
police talk like normal human beings rather than cosmopolitan
wits is to be cherished.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Aug. 13, 8-10 pm EDT, on TNT: "Heat Wave." A
singularly demagogic portrait of the 1965 Watts riots that
left 35 people dead, 30 of them black. It may be worth
watching as an example of just how much vicious stereotyping
it still is possible to get away with now, so long as the
stereotyping is directed at the right group. Here is a film
in which every black, without exception, is heroic, highly
sensitive, loving and family-minded. Every white, without
exception, is either a cold, vicious redneck, a selfish
hypocrite, infantile or cowardly. They used to call this sort
of stereotyping racism.
