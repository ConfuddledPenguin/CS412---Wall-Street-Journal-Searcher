   Nautilus, a maker of exercise machinery, is based in
Dallas. The company's headquarters will be moved to
Independence, Va., the site of its manufacturing facility,
said John Urmston, chief operating officer.
   Founded in 1970 by Arthur Jones, the company gained a
reputation as the premier producer of fitness equipment. In
the mid-1980s, however, sales began to slide, and Mr. Jones
sold the company to Travis Ward, a Dallas investor. Mr.
Urmston said current revenue and earnings figures for
Nautilus weren't available.
