   Financial and technology shares led the over-the-counter
market lower as fears of weakness among the nation's major
banks and continuing anticipation of a recession spread into
smaller stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.33 to 435.91, a 0.5%
drop, as volume fell to nearly 129 million shares from 135.2
million Tuesday. Declining issues outpaced advancers 1,204 to
793.

   Traders again dominated activity in the OTC market as
institutions and smaller investors stayed on the sidelines
amid pessimistic news about the economy, said Len Hefter,
director of OTC trading at Jefferies &amp; Co., Dallas.
   "To a great degree it's a market controlled by traders,"
he said, adding that dealers continue to sell quickly on any
signs of disappointment. Mr. Hefter predicted that pattern
will continue until more encouraging news spurs investors
back to the market.
   Professional traders were particularly wary of financial
stocks, according to Eric Siefert, who trades OTC financial
shares for Shearson Lehman Brothers. "There's more or less a
general feeling that things will still get worse," Mr.
Siefert said, pointing to reports of weakness in some of the
nation's largest banks. Traders are "afraid {financial
stocks} haven't hit bottom," he explained.
   Among Nasdaq's four financial indexes, the Nasdaq
Financial Index of larger institutions fell 5.80 to 363.75;
the Nasdaq Bank Index tumbled 5.19 to 315.82; the Nasdaq
Financial Index of smaller institutions slid 4.82 to 417.59,
and the Nasdaq Insurance Index plunged 6.65 to 490.91.
   Yesterday's wave of selling among smaller financial issues
was sparked by two media stories, according to James K.
Schmidt, portfolio manager of the $60 million Freedom
Regional Bank Fund, a Boston mutual fund. One was an article
yesterday in this newspaper about profit problems at some
larger banks. The other was a discussion Tuesday night on
ABC's "Nightline" television news program in which a Stanford
University economist predicted several major banks will
become insolvent.
   Although some regional banks in areas without severe real
estate problems are doing well, Mr. Schmidt said the shares
of the entire sector are being punished by fears about the
larger banks. He added that he finds the total lack of
interest in financial issues a bullish sign.
   After falling early in the day, technology issues ended
mixed amid continuing fears of a recession, traders said.
Among the OTC market's leaders, Microsoft added 1/4 to 66 3/4
after trading as low as 63 3/4; Intel fell 2 to 42 1/2; Apple
Computer gained 3/8 to 42 3/8, and Sun Microsystems was
unchanged at 31 1/2.
   Among the day's stronger technology issues, Teradata
jumped 2 to 25 3/4 after the Los Angeles maker of computer
systems reported late Tuesday that operating income for the
fourth quarter ended June 30 rose slightly to 44 cents a
share from 43 cents a year earlier. Teradata's per-share
profit was three cents above a consensus of analysts'
estimates reported by First Call, a subsidiary of Thomson
Financial Networks.
   National Health Laboratories was the day's most active
stock after 14.8 million shares of its common stock were
offered at $13.25 apiece. Nearly all of the shares are being
offered by Revlon Health Care Group Inc., which owns about
95% of the New York provider of clinical laboratory services'
common shares. National Health eased 1/8 to 13 1/8 on nearly
four million shares.
   Biotechnology shares remained active. Immunex slid 1/2 to
26 1/2, although it rebounded as high as 28 in intraday
trading after plunging four Tuesday. The drop followed a Food
and Drug Administration advisory panel's decision to delay
approval of the Seattle company's GM-CSF white blood cell
stimulant for use in bone marrow transplants. An Immunex
official told analysts late Tuesday the company hopes that it
will have additional data available "sometime this fall" for
the panel's further review, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Amgen and Genetics Institute benefited from Immunex's
delay, analysts said. Both Amgen, which jumped 2 1/2 to 88
3/4, and Genetics Institute, which rose 1 to 35 1/4, are
developing similar agents, although for broader applications
than the product Immunex is developing for use in bone marrow
transplants. Their products haven't been reviewed yet by an
FDA advisory panel.
   Vector Securities analyst Peter Drake said in an interview
he expects Immunex could win full approval for its agent by
year end. But he believes Amgen will ultimately gain about
60% of the broader market for use in treating chemotherapy
patients, with Immunex getting about 40% of that market. He
said he's advising clients that now is an opportune time to
buy both stocks.
   Summagraphics added 1/4 to 11 1/4, although the Seymour,
Conn., maker of computer graphic input devices reported that
net income for the fourth quarter ended May 31 fell to 21
cents a share from 46 cents a year earlier. Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman William J. Lifka attributed the
performance to an acquisition and a slowdown in some of its
markets, but said the company expects sales growth to return
to earlier levels.
   Novell added 1 1/2 to 49. Smith Barney, Harris Upham
analyst Therese M. Murphy raised her investment opinion on
the Provo, Utah, maker of connectivity software to
"aggressive buy" from "hold," based on recent weakness in the
stock, DJPIR said.
   FHP International dropped 7/8 to 16 1/8. The Fountain
Valley, Calif., health maintenance organization said its
fourth quarter pretax income will be affected to some degree
by a boost in reserves to cover medical malpractice claims
involving an earlier period when the company was self
insured. The reserves increase resulted from a recent, $10
million jury award arising from an incident in 1983.
   Great Country Bank fell 1/2 to 4 1/2 after the Ansonia,
Conn., bank reported a loss for the fourth quarter ended May
31 of $1.03 a share, including a $3.3 million provision for
loan losses, compared with net income of 31 cents a share a
year earlier. The bank attributed its losses to increased
provisions for loan losses related to the weak Connecticut
real estate market.
   Shorewood Packaging, extending its slide, fell 1 1/2 to 19
after Merrill Lynch analyst Arthur Rade lowered his estimates
for the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended Tuesday,
to 31 cents a share from 36 cents a share. DJPIR reported
that Mr. Rade, who retained his "buy" opinion on the
Farmingdale, N.Y., maker of paperboard packaging for the
music industry, cited a flat music industry business, among
other factors.
