   APL Corp. said it missed a total of $4.1 million in debt
payments due yesterday, permitting its creditors to declare
about $27.1 million of principal outstanding "immediately due
and payable" in 30 days.
   APL, controlled by Miami financier Victor Posner, said
such a declaration would also trigger the acceleration of
payment obligations on $8 million of other debt. It said it
is negotiating with debt holders "concerning the cure or
other satisfaction" of the payments it missed yesterday.
