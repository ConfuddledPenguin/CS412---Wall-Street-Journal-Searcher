   NEW YORK -- Chiat/Day/Mojo, widely considered among the
best ad agencies in the country, abruptly laid off about 40
people, and imposed pay cuts on management in the wake of
account losses and shrinking client spending.
   The deep cuts came as a shock to the ad industry. Chiat
has been one of the nation's most successful ad agencies in
recent years. It created the year's most talked-about ad, the
Eveready pink bunny campaign, and is well-known for its work
for Nissan, Reebok, and Arrow shirts, among others. It
retained its reputation for breakthrough creative work even
as it broke the $1 billion mark in world-wide billings.

   But Chiat, like every other ad agency, has been hit by a
slowdown in client spending, along with client defections.
Just this year, Reebok pulled its $40 million domestic ad
account from the agency. More recently, Royal Caribbean
cruise lines put its $30 million to $35 million account up
for review. The agency has also lost some smaller accounts,
including Sara Lee, which had once billed about $12 million,
and Bissell, a carpet cleaning company, with billings of
about $10 million.
   But as losses piled up, the agency hasn't won any major
new accounts recently. "We've lost two big accounts. We've
got to deal with that," said Bob Wolf, chairman and chief
executive officer of the agency's North American operations.
"We've also got industry problems. We've got clients who are
cutting back on their expenditures, and we aren't immune from
that."
   Mr. Wolf said about 36 to 40 of Chiat's 1,100 staffers
were laid off, with all but half a dozen of those in New
York, where the Royal Caribbean account had been serviced.
The remainder were in the Los Angeles office. He added that
fewer than 20 senior managers and directors had taken pay
cuts of 10% or more.
   "We're trying to save some jobs by coming up with money in
a different way than just reducing staff," he said.
"Hopefully, it will also send a signal to everybody that this
isn't about lots of people losing their jobs and management
being fat and happy. We're shouldering part of this
responsibility."
   Mr. Wolf said the agency was also taking other measures,
including cutting back office staff and re-examining overhead
expenses like real estate. "We're obviously hopeful that
these will be temporary measures all around," he said. But he
added that Chiat isn't optimistic about the ad business in
the short term.
   "I think the whole country is tightening their budgets.
Everybody in the agency business is facing the same issues.
There's a real cautious attitude out there. People believe if
we aren't in a recession, we're close to being in a
recession." He added, "We aren't real optimistic that 1991 is
going to be a great year for the economy. We're responding to
get ourselves ready for any potential bad news that comes
along."
   Chiat's problems aren't just attributable to a poor
economy, though. The agency has had a history of difficult
relationships with clients, despite its reputation for
creativity. Chiat made its name in the 1980s with widely
acclaimed campaigns for Nike footwear and Apple computers,
among others, yet both clients dumped it soon afterwards.
   Similarly, Chiat won notice and some notoriety for its
latest Reebok campaign -- including a commercial banned by
the networks because it featured bungee jumpers diving from a
bridge -- before Reebok fired it. Industry executives say the
agency has a reputation for sometimes being haughty and for
patronizing clients who don't agree with its creative ideas.
Chiat's design unit, Bright &amp; Associates, also laid off about
a dozen people in its New York and Los Angeles offices. The
move was especially surprising to staffers, since Bright had
just moved to new quarters in California and had held a big
opening bash just last Friday.
   Keith Bright, chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to comment on numbers, but confirmed that he laid
off staffers and that the top half-dozen managers took pay
cuts. "We have a number of projects that {clients} are
putting on hold," he said. "The big projects aren't as fast
coming around as they used to be. Just like advertising has
cut back, they {design clients} have cut their projects
back."
