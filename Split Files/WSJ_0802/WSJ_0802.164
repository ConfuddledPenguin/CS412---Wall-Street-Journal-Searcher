   Reliance Group Holdings Inc. reported second-quarter net
income of $164.8 million, or $2.20 a share, largely because
of a one-time gain from the sale of the insurance company's
General Casualty subsidiary.
   In the year-earlier period, Reliance had a loss of $6
million, or 8 cents a share. Revenue in the recent quarter
rose 26%, to $1.15 billion from $911 million.

   The sale of General Casualty, completed in April, resulted
in an after-tax gain of $245.5 million. Another extraordinary
gain of $4.6 million resulted from early debt retirement, but
the gains were offset somewhat by losses totaling $80.7
million from the write-down and sale of various portfolio
holdings.
   New York-based Reliance blamed soft pricing and losses
from recent fires around Santa Barbara, Calif., for a drop in
profitability in its property and casuality insurance
operations, its largest lines of business.
   For the six months, Reliance reported net income of $174.4
million, or $2.33 a share, compared with $21.1 million, or 28
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 17.5% to $2.08
billion.
