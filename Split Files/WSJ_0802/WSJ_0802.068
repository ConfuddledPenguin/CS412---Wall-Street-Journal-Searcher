   WASHINGTON -- The government savings-and-loan liquidator
announced an ambitious plan to accelerate its sale of seized
S&amp;L assets, with a target of $50 billion of sales by the end
of the year.
   If successful, the Resolution Trust Corp.'s "fall
inventory reduction sale," which includes land, homes,
apartments, securities and loans, would double the pace of
sales, moving as much property in the next five months as the
agency did its entire first year of operation.

   The asset-disposal plan represents the government's second
major effort to reduce the debris from the S&amp;L bailout this
year. In the April-June quarter, the agency, under increasing
political pressure to show results, sold 155 failed thrifts.
But in order to attract buyers to those deals, the RTC was
only able to sell the thrifts' deposits. Those deals left the
RTC's current asset stockpile swollen to $165.3 billion.
   The fall sales plan also includes the RTC's
much-anticipated, televised auction of 71 big-ticket
properties, which has been postponed from September until
November in order to give potential buyers more time to
examine the properties.
   The $50 billion runs the gamut from hard-to-sell tracts of
land, which one official said are "best described as simply
holding the Earth together," to readily marketable packages
of on-time mortgages.
   "If they can't sell this kind of stuff, then Lord help us
all," said John Aldridge, an Atlanta thrift attorney. "These
are the more easily understood and marketable types of
assets."
   The plan, however, includes sales of $13.7 billion of its
hard-to-sell assets in receivership. These are investments
S&amp;Ls made, which have been down a long road through
government foreclosure, but which have been passed over by
potential buyers every step of the way. "It's the bad stuff,"
said William Roelle, in charge of S&amp;L sales at the RTC. "It's
the leftovers."
   Some of the assets are unusual, but saleable. Of the $6.7
billion in performing mortgages that the RTC hopes to sell
this year, 80% don't meet standards to be sold into the
secondary market. The RTC hopes to sell many of these in bulk
to big buyers. Just yesterday, it announced the sale of $225
million of second mortgages to Maryland National Bank.
   Sales plans also include two packages for "bulk" real
estate sales, each valued at approximately $40 million. One
package contains 11 hotels in the eastern U.S., the other
several Florida apartment buildings.
   Among the RTC's $3.3 billion of securities in receivership
are "several hundred million" in high-risk, high-yield "junk"
bonds that will be sold by year's end, according to Elisabeth
Spector, who oversees the RTC's securities sales.
   Most observers were optimistic that the goals were
reachable, especially as markets are growing more familiar
with the RTC and its plans. The sales include, for example,
nearly $3 billion in mortgage-backed securities from
receivership assets alone. That's a large amount, but Lyle
Gramley, chief economist with Mortgage Bankers Association,
was sanguine. "A year ago we worried about possible large RTC
sales, but they didn't materialize," he said. "I don't think
yields will be affected."
   There is so little activity in private issuing of
mortgage-backed securities that "under current conditions the
RTC probably has some room to do some liquidating," said Paul
DeRosa, a managing director at Eastbridge Capital Inc.
   The sales will still represent just the beginning for the
RTC, which, as more S&amp;Ls fail, may eventually seize and
resell a total of $500 billion in assets. While its
investment-grade securities are expected to be sold within
one year of being taken over from a seized institutions, it
says it plans to hold some raw land for as long as seven
years.
   The RTC's real-estate auction will offer only a slice of
its properties, but the agency hopes the high profile of the
affair, with closed satellite linkups to nine U.S. cities,
plus London and Tokyo, will draw hundreds of bidders and spur
interest in other properties.
   Jon Karlson, an RTC official overseeing the auction,
pointed to three properties as being particularly attractive:
the 300-room Radisson Hotel at the San Antonio, Texas,
airport; the Western Savings Corporate Center in Phoenix,
Ariz., seized from the failed Western Federal Savings & Loan;
and the 18-hole Kings Crossing Golf Course &amp; Club in San
Antonio. The pool of real estate may change, however, because
the properties are still for sale before the auction. If the
RTC gets an offer of appraised value or higher it may choose
to sell prior to the auction, Mr. Karlson said.
   Mr. Karlson wouldn't specify the prices the RTC expects on
those properties or any others. Other officials said the RTC
is debating whether to make its appraisals public, but
indicated that in order to encourage higher bidding, the
appraisals probably wouldn't be disclosed. Detailed
information on each property will be available within two
weeks, the RTC said.
   The auction will be open to the public, but serious money
will be required to bid. Bidders will have to show a
cashier's check for $75,000 to $500,000, depending on the
price of the property they're seeking, said Jim Gall,
chairman of Miami-based Auction Company of America, which
will conduct the auction from Dallas.

   The Resolution Trust Corp. has $165.3 billion in assets
under management, most of that at sick thrifts it hasn't sold
or closed. It holds $37 billion in assets from dead thrifts,
and plans to sell more than a third of that holding by year's
end. The Resolution Trust Corp. also plans to sell $36
billion in assets currently in conservatorship. Below is a
breakdown, by asset group, in billions, of its holdings and
its sales plans:
