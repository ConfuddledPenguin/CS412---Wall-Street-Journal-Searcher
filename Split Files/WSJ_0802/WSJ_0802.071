   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is trying to get the United Nations
to help resolve the crisis in Liberia, where two rebel
factions are battling government forces in Monrovia, the
country's capital.
   "We are extremely concerned about the fighting and the
bloodshed," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher,
explaining that the U.S. effort is still exploratory, trying
to find a way the U.N. might exert its influence to stop the
civil war.

   Meanwhile, he said, the U.S. is helping private relief
organizations distribute 30,000 bags of rice to prevent
famine in the war-ravaged country. Other U.S. officials said
tens of thousands of Liberians have sought sanctuary in
churches and near U.S. installations in the capital, as
patrols from government troops and two rebel factions stage
sporadic fighting in downtown Monrovia.
   As many as 600 Liberians were slaughtered in a Monrovia
church on Sunday. Most of the victims are believed to have
been members of the Gio and Mano tribes, which are involved
in the rebel forces. According to Mr. Boucher, the U.S. has
eyewitness accounts that they were shot by soldiers of
President Samuel Doe, who is holed up in his fortified
headquarters in Monrovia, protected by an elite cadre of
troops. Mr. Doe and most of his troops are members of the
Krahn tribe.
   The fighting began in December, when rebel troops entered
Liberia from the north. Since then they have split into two
rival factions, the largest of which is led by Charles
Taylor, formerly the head of the government's purchasing
agency. Mr. Taylor's forces, according to one U.S. official,
are believed to include troops who have received training and
weapons from Libya.
   As the two rebel factions converged on Monrovia, the U.S.
evacuated hundreds of Americans from the country, which has a
population of 1.5 million. About 400 Americans remain,
according to the State Department, and a Marine Corps task
force has been positioned offshore in case a further
evacuation is needed. So far, according to the State
Department, there have been no attacks on embassies in
Monrovia, although some of the firefights have occurred in
the embassy district.
