   In your July 3 article "They Were Cleaning Up Nicely by
Recycling Piles of Old Paper," Detective Glenn Woods of Kent,
Wash., said, "If you could take a bank for $1,200 a day
without using a gun, wouldn't you do it?" To which I answer
with a resounding, "No, I would not," and I would like to
believe that most people in this country would not.
