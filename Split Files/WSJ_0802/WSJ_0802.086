   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Liberty National Bancorp. said it
expects third-quarter net income to be reduced between 14 and
17 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, as a result of its
increasing loan-loss provisions.
   The bank holding company, which had 1989 third-quarter
profit of $8 million, or 71 cents a fully diluted share, said
it expects to increase its provisions for loan losses to
between $6.5 million and $7.1 million from $3.9 million in
the second quarter.
