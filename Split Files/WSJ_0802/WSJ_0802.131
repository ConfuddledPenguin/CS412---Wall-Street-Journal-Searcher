   FHP International Corp., a health maintenance organization
based in Fountain Valley, Calif., said earnings for its
fourth quarter, ended June 30, will be hurt by a recent $10
million jury verdict against it.
   In a medical malpractice suit, the jury awarded the
plaintiffs $10 million plus interest and costs, FHP said. As
a result, FHP will increase its malpractice reserves for
claims relating to the period 1975-83.

   FHP said its medical treatment was entirely appropriate in
this case and that it intends to request a new trial and to
seek a reduction of damages. If the requested relief isn't
granted, it will appeal.
   The company said it hasn't determined the suit's exact
impact on earnings for the fourth quarter and the year. In
the year-earlier fourth quarter, FHP posted a $7.7 million
profit, or 65 cents a share, on revenue of $199.3 million.
For fiscal 1989, FHP reported net income of $22 million, or
$2.05, on revenue of $699.1 million.
   The company declined to provide further details on the
malpractice case.
