   TORONTO -- Operations were halted yesterday at two of
Canada's largest steel producers as about 16,000 union
members began striking following a breakdown of contract
talks.
   The shutdowns at Stelco Inc. and Algoma Steel Corp., a
subsidiary of Dofasco Inc., come as Canada's steel industry
is under pressure from a slowing domestic economy and
increased penetration of the Canadian market by U.S.
steelmakers.

   Leo Gerard, director of District Six of the United
Steelworkers of America, said the union, which represents
about 10,000 workers at Toronto-based Stelco, rejected what
the company has called its final contract offer, proposing
wage increases of about 2.5% in each year of a three-year
pact. The union is seeking a higher wage settlement and
better protection against inflation for workers and
pensioners.
   At Algoma, where the union represents about 6,000 workers,
monetary issues haven't been broached, Mr. Gerard said. Talks
with the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company broke down
over language concerning the contracting-out of work.
   Officials at both companies said an orderly shutdown of
operations had been underway for several days in anticipation
of a strike. Fred Telmer, president of Stelco's steel
division, said inventory stockpiles have been transferred to
customers. Mr. Telmer added, "We're in a closed mode."
