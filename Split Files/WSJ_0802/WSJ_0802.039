   Actress Meryl Streep, last seen on TV doing toxicological
analysis to drive the apple-preserving chemical Alar from the
market, is now analyzing her own profession. Citing a study
that says men had twice as many roles as women in 1989's
movies, Ms. Streep says that if this trend persists, "by the
year 2000, we will have 13% of roles . . . and in 20 years we
will be eliminated from the movies."
