   ARLINGTON, Texas -- Bizmart Inc. said its sales for the
first quarter ended July 28 more than doubled to $48.3
million from $19.7 million a year earlier. Sales increased
22% at stores in existence for more than a year.
   Bizmart, a chain of 41 office product superstores, also
said it expected to report a loss for the quarter because of
seasonal declines in sales and the expenses related to
opening nine stores.
