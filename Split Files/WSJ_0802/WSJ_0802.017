   HONG KONG -- Sarah Lo steps into the air-conditioned lobby
of a Citibank branch here to take her place behind three
people waiting to approach the teller's open counter. Two
others are using the automatic teller machines nearby.
   Meanwhile, at a branch of a major local bank half a block
away, more than 20 people stand impatiently in a queue that
snakes through the lobby toward distant tellers perched
behind thick, counter-to-ceiling bulletproof plastic. Seven
other customers stand outside in sweltering heat to use the
bank's streetside ATMs.

   For Ms. Lo, one of the many young Hong Kong professionals
that Citibank targets, the appearances are important. "You
can tell they're better; it's a big difference from local
banks," she says.
   The scene repeats itself, with variations, across much of
Asia. Whether financing motor scooters in Bombay or marketing
"preferred" gold credit cards to yuppies in Singapore,
Citibank is doggedly pursuing in Asia its goal of becoming a
global consumer bank -- the grand vision of John Reed,
chairman of Citibank's parent, Citicorp.
   Perhaps nowhere has Citibank been more successful than in
Asia, competing with entrenched domestic banks on their own
turf by offering innovative services, new technology and, as
in Ms. Lo's case, giving customers what they want. In some
countries, Citibank is nudging entire banking sectors
forward, though analysts warn that domestic monoliths have
awakened and competition may intensify.
   Citibank officials imagine that in a few years, customers
will be able to tap their accounts through ATMs around the
world. Already, there are 22 Asian banking centers at
Citibank offices in such cities as New York, Los Angeles and
London to serve mobile Asian clients.
   "Citibank behaves in every market like a local bank," says
the general manager of another U.S. bank in Hong Kong.
"They've taken a much bigger chance than other foreign
banks," which traditionally have left the retail side to
domestic banks.
   Pei-yuan Chia, group executive in charge of Citibank's
international consumer banking, says the bank intends to
reach 10 million affluent Asian households by the end of the
decade, a fivefold increase from the present. That's an
expensive proposition when stretched across Asia, from Japan
to India. And the cost could rise if economic growth slows or
banking liberalization stalls in just a couple of those
countries.
   "Probably every bank that is looking at the retail side of
banking is looking at Citibank as the benchmark," says Brian
Waterhouse, a banking analyst for James Capel (Far East)
Ltd., an affiliate of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
Another analyst calls Citibank a "screaming success in Asia.
Citibank's approach in consumer banking has been excellent."
   The bank's approach in Hong Kong is based on years of
experience with its giant New York network. Citibank even
sent out Steve H. Price, former head of consumer banking in
New York, to run the North Asia division. Mr. Price says
consumer banking in the British colony is nearly as advanced
as in New York, and that Citibank is positioned even better
in Hong Kong than in New York. "We're more successful because
we're really tightly focused," he says.
   That focus is the top 30% to 50% income bracket of the
population, to whom the bank markets itself as a status
symbol and a leader in service in a competitive banking
environment. "If you want to buy from K mart, don't come to
us, but if you think Gucci is the right thing, then we are
the right thing," Mr. Chia says.
   Ms. Lo is the perfect Citibank target. She is a chic
accountant in her early 30s who works in the colony's Central
commercial and financial district. She has accounts at
several banks and knows the rates paid at others. After
shopping around, Ms. Lo chose Citibank because it paid more
on foreign-currency deposits than local banks did. And, Ms.
Lo says, the bank's advertisements didn't lie: Citibank
service is better.
   Like local banks, Citibank plans to stay in Hong Kong
after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Its
exposure in the territory seems to highlight the risk
Citibank runs by investing in many Asian markets at once.
Problems in one country could hurt the bank regionwide.
   For example, more than half of Citibank's Hong Kong loan
portfolio is in home mortgages, most of which stretch beyond
1997. Hong Kong people might walk away from their debts, some
banking analysts caution. But Mr. Price says the mortgages
are made mostly to the "people who will stay in Hong Kong."
   Other Citibank officials note that the bank has profited
in more volatile locales. In the Philippines, where a
revolution and a series of coup attempts in the past few
years have crippled the economy, Citibank benefited because
customers shifted their deposits to it from local banks. More
generally, bank officials say, Citibank's regional strategy
ensures that if operations in one country suffer, steady
business in the rest of Asia will compensate.
   Citibank's Asian strategy is costly. Officials won't say
how much the bank is investing in the region, except that it
is "a lot and not enough."
   Investment is concentrated in two areas: credit cards and
technology. Telebanking and sophisticated ATMs help the bank
overcome the disadvantage of government limitations on local
branch networks. In Japan, nearly 30% of the bank's customers
were able to open their accounts without ever stepping into a
branch office. In some cities, Citibank provides personal
bankers so that customers can become familiar with the same
person over time.
   Citibank's approach to local banking often seems
far-fetched in the region's less-developed markets. In
Taiwan, for example, the idea of a mortgage was revolutionary
until the mid-1980s, so much so that the government was
reluctant to let Citibank offer mortgages.
   Home purchases in Taiwan long were financed in the Chinese
tradition, borrowing from family or tapping lifetime savings.
But as property prices soared and more young people entered
the housing market, Citibank saw an opening. Citibank's
requests to offer home mortgages were turned down twice
before regulators in Taipei decided in 1985 to "give those
crazy Americans a chance," as one Citibank executive puts it.
Today, Citibank remains ahead of its competition in the
mortgage business.
   Citibank officials now plan to introduce telebanking so
that customers can bank without having to negotiate Taipei's
notorious traffic to reach one of the two branches. But
Citibank remains limited to two branches to serve the island
republic's 20 million people. Further expansion depends in
part on the continuation of banking liberalization, as is the
case in South Korea and Thailand, where Citibank repeated its
success in mortgages and where the bank is also restricted
from enlarging its branch network.
   "Where markets are highly protected, there's a limit as to
how much Citibank can do," says Richard Wong, a principal
with Egon Zehnder International Ltd., an international
executive search firm. "But if you assume liberalization,
Citibank should be able to expand."
   So far, the governments of the three countries are
convinced that Citibank is helping to improve consumer
banking overall. But local banks are pressing regulators to
slow liberalization so they can regroup to fight the foreign
competition.
   Government restrictions are a problem in 10 of the 15
Asian countries where Citibank now operates. "That's a big
number," says Citibank's Mr. Chia.
