   SEATTLE -- Boeing Co. said it received a $117 million
order for two 767-200 twin-engine jets from Mozambique's
national airline, Linhas Aereas de Mozambique. The airline
also obtained an option for one more of the extended-range
jets.
   Boeing said each plane will be configured to carry 192
passengers non-stop between Paris and Maputo, Mozambique. It
said the planes will be powered by PW4000 engines built by
Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.,
Hartford, Conn.
