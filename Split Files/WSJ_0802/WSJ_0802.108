   WASHINGTON -- Washington Bancorp., hurt by real estate
loans that turned sour, said it filed for protection from its
creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
   The company is the parent of National Bank of Washington
and other small banking units, though they weren't included
in the filing, made under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code. The parent said in a statement that it
expects its stockholders "will be unable to realize value for
their interest in the company."

   The statement added that the company's creditors "will
likely receive less than the face value" of their securities.
   Washington Bancorp. said it is still reviewing its
options, including liquidation or reorganization of its
assets. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate but
has court protection against creditors' lawsuits while it
tries to work out a plan for paying its debts. The company
added that its filing, which couldn't be obtained last
evening, listed known liabilities of about $61.7 million and
assets of an "undetermined" market value.
   Company officers, who weren't available for comment, were
said to be still meeting yesterday evening with federal
regulators.
   Washington Bancorp. isn't related to Washington Bancorp
Inc., based in Hoboken, N.J.
   The troubles of Washington Bancorp. reflect both a
downturn in the real estate market and a more general
economic slowdown in the Washington area. The company said
last month that it mightn't be able to continue operating,
after posting a second-quarter loss of $80 million, or $11.28
a share. The loss knocked the capital of National Bank of
Washington, the District of Columbia's fourth-largest bank,
below federal standards.
   The parent company said at the end of the second quarter
that its assets were $1.8 billion.
   Other banking companies in the region have encountered
troubles, too. Perpetual Financial Corp. -- the Vienna, Va.,
parent of Perpetual Savings Bank, the area's largest thrift
-- had a $50.2 million loss in its second quarter ended April
30. MNC Financial Inc., the Baltimore-based holding company
for some of the area's largest commercial banks, has had its
debt classified as below investment grade, or "junk."
   Stockholders of Washington Bancorp. have already seen the
value of their shares plummet from a high this year of $18.50
each. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the
shares fell 12.5 cents each to close at $1, lowering the
total market value of Washington Bancorp. to $7.1 million.
   Among the creditors at risk are holders of the company's
commercial paper. The principal amount of that debt is $35.2
million.
   Washington Bancorp. had said earlier this month that its
ability to continue as a going concern would be in doubt
unless it could put into effect a plan to restore its
capital, restructure its nonperforming assets, and reach an
accommodation with creditors.
   Contributing to the large second-quarter loss was a $61
million addition to loan-loss reserves, which was made after
company officials and regulators did a review of the
company's assets. The company also took charges of $15
million on asset sales and write-downs in the latest quarter.
   The problem with the bank's loan portfolio "further
illustrates the problems in real estate" in the
Washington-Baltimore region, said Elizabeth Hayes, an analyst
with Johnston Lemon in Washington.
   About 52% of the bank's loan portfolio is in real estate
loans, mostly covering residential and commercial properties.
At the end of the second quarter, the bank had $156 million
in nonperforming loans, of which 66% were real estate loans.
Analysts also noted that the bank was a major lender to
several Washington-area real estate developers, who have
recently filed under the bankruptcy laws themselves.
   A cash squeeze at the holding company came about in early
May, when a group of banks pulled a line of credit that had
backed the commercial paper Washington Bancorp. had issued to
support its mortgage unit. Without the credit line, the
company wasn't able to issue any more commercial paper.
   Also in May, the company named John J. Mason chairman and
chief executive officer and gave preliminary approval to a
plan to refinance its debt by issuing $45 million in new
secured notes. Mr. Mason, formerly chairman of NS&amp;T
Bankshares Inc., Washington, was to be one of the investors
in the new debt issue. But the plan fell through as the
company's condition deteriorated.
   Washington Bancorp. noted that National Bank of Washington
and its other banking units, Washington Bank (Va.) and
Washington Bank (Md.), remain open for business, and that
their deposits continue to be insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. for as much as $100,000 for each customer
account.
