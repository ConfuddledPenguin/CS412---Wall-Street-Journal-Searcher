   Let's see if we understand the new system. The President's
thoughts about budget cuts on domestic issues are irrelevant,
but if Congress targets strategic programs for oblivion the
Commander in Chief can do nothing about it. President Bush
plans a speech today to salvage the Pentagon budget, but it
may be too little too late.
   Chairman Les Aspin led the charge when his House Armed
Services Committee slashed $24 billion from the Bush defense
budget of $307 billion. This includes chopping nearly $2
billion from SDI's $4.7 billion proposal and the elimination
of the entire B-2 Stealth Bomber program.

   Stealth won't be coming up on anyone's radar screen if the
House committee has its way. The committee voted to eliminate
the entire program after the 15 planes already authorized are
built. This drove Rep. Ron Dellums, the Berkeley dove, into
deep rapture. "I've been awake since about 4:30 this morning
trying to come to grips with what we've done," he said
yesterday. "I was out running at 6 this morning just because
I was exhilarated."
   The Senate may salvage some of the worst cuts, but its
price may be the death of strategic defense. Democrats
Richard Shelby and Jeff Bingaman plan to offer an amendment
on the Senate floor this week that would deny President Bush
the option of deploying SDI anytime this decade. Not
coincidentally, the amendment would steer SDI money to
projects in the senators' states, Alabama and New Mexico.
   Senator Sam Nunn once suggested he'd support this
amendment, but now is having second thoughts. Significantly,
he wants to see enough money spent to adequately test
Brilliant Pebbles, the little satellites that might one day
intercept incoming missiles. "We have to look at that
technology," Mr. Nunn told us yesterday, since it may have
other important uses such as communications. This is welcome
news, though we can't agree with him that SDI needs more
"line-item and management guidance" from Congress. When has
any weapon benefited from Congressional micromanagement?
   There is plenty for President Bush to say about American
defenses. He might note that for all the changes, there is no
evidence that the Soviet Union has slowed its military
spending by one soft ruble. SS-24 and SS-25 nuclear missiles
still roll down the assembly line, pointing at the U.S.
   Even if the Cold War eventually thaws on the Soviet side
as well, Congress has taken aim at the very defense systems
that make sense in a world where the typical threat is posed
by places such as Libya and Iraq. Stealth is designed to slip
nuclear weapons by Soviet radar, but with its 10,000-mile
range can also get conventional weapons to anywhere in the
world. SDI becomes more important as each tinpot dictator
inevitably gets his hands on ballistic missiles.
   Strategy obviously means one thing to Pentagon planners
and quite another to doves in Congress. It was a commitment
to strength that forced the Soviets to begin to change their
ways. This is no time to declare victory and announce
disarmament.
