   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in June
dropped 15% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
80% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 500,000 metric tons of
market pulp in June, compared with 590,000 tons a year
earlier. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   The June operating rate of 80% was down from 85% in May
and from 96% a year earlier.
   For the six months through June, Canadian mills produced
3,251,000 metric tons of market pulp, a 9.1% decline from
3,578,000 tons a year earlier. The industry operated at 86%
of capacity in the first half, down from 97% a year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.
   Total market shipments in June dropped 19% to 510,000
metric tons from 632,000 tons a year earlier. Shipments to
all markets were down.
   Market shipments in the first half dropped 14% to
3,038,000 metric tons from 3,549,000 tons a year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of June totaled
573,000 metric tons, a 35-day supply, compared with 583,000
tons, a 35-day supply, at the end of May, and 268,000 tons, a
13-day supply, at the end of June 1989.
