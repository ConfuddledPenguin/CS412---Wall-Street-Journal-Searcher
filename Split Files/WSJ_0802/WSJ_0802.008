   CLEVELAND -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said 2,000 workers
began a strike at two Michigan mines it manages after members
of the United Steelworkers rejected an offer that would have
increased wages by about $1.50 an hour over four years.
   No further talks have been scheduled and neither side
would predict how long the strike would last.

   The company said union demands would have led to an
overall $40-per hour increase in benefits and wages over the
four-year contract.
   But David Foster, a negotiator for the workers, said union
demands amounted to about a $12-per-hour increase over four
years and added that the company did not respond to three
subsequent union offers. "We're waiting to negotiate," he
said.
   Mr. Foster said workers currently earn an average of
$13.70 an hour including incentive pay, about the same level
they were paid in 1982.
   For Cleveland-Cliffs, a prolonged strike could be
devastating. The two mines, in Empire and Tilden, account for
a large share of the company's business, with a combined
annual capacity of 16 million tons. The strike could also
hurt other company operations, which support the primary iron
ore business.
   "It will be a very expensive strike," particularly if it
lasts for more than a week or two, said Harry W. Millis, an
analyst at Cleveland's McDonald &amp; Co. Both mines were
producing and shipping at near capacity, Mr. Millis added, so
they won't be able to make up for lost output.
   The two mines, which are owned by a group that includes a
Cleveland-Cliffs subsidiary and steel companies, produced 8.3
million tons of iron ore pellets in the first seven months of
this year.
   A company spokesman said the last strike against
Cleveland-Cliffs was in 1977. The company, which manages four
other mines, posted second-quarter earnings of $14.1 million,
or $1.21 per share, on revenue of $89.3 million.
