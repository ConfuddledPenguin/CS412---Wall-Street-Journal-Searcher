   Southern Pacific Transportation Co. said it terminated an
agreement with Soo Line Railroad Co. to purchase Soo's rail
line connecting Kansas City and Chicago; however, the company
said it reached a trackage rights agreement with Burlington
Northern Inc. that would give it a Chicago route.
   Financially troubled Southern Pacific, a San Francisco
unit of Denver-based Rio Grande Industries, had sought to
acquire its own direct rail route to Chicago to better
compete with Western rail rivals.

   But the company said it failed to gain the consent of
Chicago &amp; North Western Transportation Co., which has joint
ownership of a small portion of the line. Southern Pacific
had planned to spend $86 million to purchase the 532-mile
route from Soo and another $50 million to renovate the track
over three years.
   Having called off the agreement to purchase the line,
Southern Pacific said it reached a trackage rights agreement
with Burlington Northern. Under the agreement, Southern
Pacific will operate trains with its own locomotives and
crews on Burlington Northern's 466-mile route between Kansas
City and Chicago. Southern Pacific declined to discuss terms.
   Soo Line, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian Pacific
Ltd., said the proposed sale of its line to Southern Pacific
had received unanimous approval from the Interstate Commerce
Commission. But Soo said it faced "excessive economic
demands" from Chicago &amp; North Western for consent to Soo's
transfer of ownership of a 37-mile portion of the line. CNW
Corp., Chicago &amp; North Western's parent, declined to comment.
