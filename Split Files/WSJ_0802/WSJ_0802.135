   Berliner Bank AG of West Germany said it signed a letter
of intent to acquire in a two-step process the
corporate-banking subsidiary of East Germany's former central
bank, Staatsbank.
   Berliner Bank said it first will help Berliner Stadtbank
AG transform itself from a bank serving state-run businesses
into a universal banking group offering a full array of
financial services for commercial and private customers.

<TEXT>
   Berliner Stadtbank was spun off as an independent banking
group as part of the April 1 banking reform in East Germany.
Its shareholders are the Staatsbank Berlin, successor to the
former central bank, as well as some other East German
enterprises, a Berliner Bank spokesman said.
   Stadtbank at the beginning of July opened 13 branch
offices in East Berlin in an effort to start up a
retail-banking business.
   Meantime, Berliner Bank said it will "support with all its
power" the new East German partner's aim to become a
competitive universal bank.
   Once the transformation of Berliner Stadtbank is complete,
the two companies will merge into one legal entity under
Berliner Bank's name and management control, the official
said.
