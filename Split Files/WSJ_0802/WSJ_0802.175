   While much of America slumbered, Dorothy Thompson slugged
it out with the fascists. She was the first journalist
expelled from the Third Reich on Hitler's personal order, and
her steady flow of articles, books, lectures and radio
commentary played no small part in cajoling a complacent and
willfully provincial people into mortal combat with the
Nazis.
   By the time she succumbed to a final heart attack at age
67, Thompson had passed her prime. Succeeding generations
largely forgot her accomplishments as pioneering woman and
path-breaking journalist, the first of the modern pundit
superstars who made both a career and a fortune telling
people what to think. Only a few remembered her as the
inspiration for Katharine Hepburn's title character in "Woman
of the Year," or the first wife of Sinclair Lewis, Nobelist
and drunken maniac. But only now, 29 years after her death,
has her story received the treatment it deserves in the rich
account by Peter Kurth: "American Cassandra: The Life of
Dorothy Thompson" (Little, Brown, 892 pages, $24.95).

   The eldest daughter of an itinerant Scottish preacher,
Thompson was born and raised outside Buffalo in "a typical,
very nearly mail-order version of the American small town."
The Thompsons lived on tithes and, when times were hard,
money was scarcer.
   What Rev. Thompson lacked in cash, he compensated for with
his reverence for learning. Dorothy grew up in a world in
which the printed word was sacred, and while attending
Syracuse University she earned a reputation as one of the
most frightening dates imaginable. Apparently, Saturday night
with Doro meant "a walk in the moonlight and a talk about
Hegel." By successive loops of fate, her ambitions as a
writer led her to the Buffalo mailroom of the New York State
Woman Suffrage Party and, eventually, to the campaign stump,
where she agitated and exhorted throughout upstate New York
for the right to vote.
   Eventually, wanderlust sent her aboard a steamer, sharing
quarters with a shipload of Zionists headed to London. Once
there, Dorothy had the moxie to bill herself as an expert on
Palestine to the old International News Service, which then
picked her up as its expert and, ultimately, roving global
correspondent. Women had, after all, always made good spies.
Why not foreign correspondents? And so, Thompson swaggered
through Europe, breaking stories and leaving a trail of
Dorothy legends in her wake.
   She married, as luck would have it, an almost
pathologically insecure pan-European of uncertain origin who
spent his days writing a hopelessly gargantuan sociology
treatise simultaneously in three languages. Joseph, as he
spelled it, (or Josef, as she did), struggled vainly to
complete his magnum opus while Dorothy's career flourished.
The two had affairs, parted ways and divorced, leaving
Dorothy to marry Sinclair Lewis, whose weeklong benders were
legendary in literary circles throughout Europe and America.
   This is Lewis's story almost as much as it is Dorothy's,
for Mr. Kurth draws one of the most memorable, and
horrifying, portraits of the author ever committed to paper.
"He was a man of compulsive neatness and terrifying
perfectionism," writes Mr. Kurth, "an almost prudish decorum
that vanished completely when he drank." Lewis's career hit
one peak in 1930, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize. But as
Dorothy's fame grew, so Sinclair saw himself diminished.
Their marriage produced a child, but it also encouraged
Dorothy to indulge a long-suppressed urge toward
homosexuality.
   By the time Hitler threw Dorothy out of his playpen (der
Fuehrer took exception to the tart remarks in her 1932
fusillade, "I Saw Hitler"), her fame was sealed. Back in the
U.S., Dorothy found a berth at the New York Herald Tribune,
where her thrice-weekly column, "On the Record," played
across the page from the oracular pronouncements of Walter
Lippmann's "Today and Tomorrow." There, as Mr. Kurth lucidly
documents, she busily alienated almost everyone.
   Thompson railed against the New Deal, antagonizing
liberals -- "the oracle of Wall Street," FDR sneeringly
called her. As a classic conservative, she had less patience
for the blind patriotism, which she saw as precursor to
fascism, and the smug isolationism of the day. "Society is
deranged," she once wrote in the Ladies Home Journal. "It is
very sick indeed," dominated "by intellectual giants who are
moral and emotional morons." Her views cost her her berth at
the Tribune, the unofficial journal of establishment
Republicanism, when she abandoned Wendell Wilkie and his
anti-war compatriots for Roosevelt's more militant platform.
   Her column survived for another 18 years, but Thompson's
greatest days were clearly spent sounding the alarms about
impending war and the dangers of Nazi ideology. "The enemy of
fascism is reason," she wrote. "Its enemies are all those
manifestations of the human spirit which derive from profound
personal experience -- art, for instance, and thought."
   Few columnists have been able to devote themselves to a
cause with such integrity and utter, even obsessive,
devotion. Then again, few have found an evil of the
dimensions of Nazism. But in a day of dime-a-dozen pundits
jabbering on the talk shows, Thompson's diligence and
influence are worth recalling. Mr. Kurth's compulsively
readable account allows us to re-live an age and do just
that.
