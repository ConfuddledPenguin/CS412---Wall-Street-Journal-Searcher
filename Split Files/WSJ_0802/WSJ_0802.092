   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. plans further cutbacks in the
staff and assets of Philipp Brothers Inc. and may even
consider a sale of the unprofitable commodities unit.
   The expected move follows the most recent dismal results
at Philipp Brothers, which last week posted a pretax loss of
$62 million, its sixth consecutive quarterly deficit. That
brought total losses so far this year to $83 million.

   "Modest losses had not been liked, but were acceptable,"
James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., said.
"This is big red ink," he added. "That's not acceptable."
   Salomon, a big securities firm known for its bond-trading
skills, has long been paring its commodities business and has
talked of casting it off for more than two years. But Salomon
executives said that they are finally fed up now, and that
big changes are on the way. "This . . . has got to stop," a
Salomon executive said. "Enough already."
   Salomon has a profitable oil trading and refining
business, Phibro Energy Inc. But success has eluded the
Philipp Brothers unit, which trades metals, agricultural
products and other commodities. In the coming months,
Philipp's staff is likely to be slashed, inventories reduced
and operations further restructured, Salomon executives said,
with a view toward possibly folding or selling the unit.
   Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund was in Tokyo on business
and couldn't be reached for comment, and a Salomon spokesman
declined to comment.
   Salomon executives said specifics haven't been worked out.
But at the very least, they want to stop the bleeding at
Philipp Brothers; if the unit trades less, the hope is, it
will have smaller losses.
   Whatever happens, the experience underscores the risks
Wall Street firms face in operating businesses far from
traditional securities lines.
   The losses are particularly ironic for Salomon. First,
Salomon is known as one of the best trading firms. Second,
the Philipp Brothers commodities unit initially was part of
Phibro Corp., which acquired Salomon Brothers in 1981.
   Salomon's Phibro Energy unit was a major driver in
Salomon's earnings last year, partly because of volatile oil
prices and widening profit margins in oil refining.
   Philipp Brothers has cut back sharply from the
approximately 150 commodities it traded at the time of the
Phibro-Salomon merger to only a handful now; in previous
restructurings, Salomon sold Philipp Brothers' pig-iron plant
operations and a steel products distributor. Head count has
already been slashed: As of March 31, Philipp Brothers had
689 employees, down from 703 at year end and 744 at the end
of 1988, analysts said. The unit's assets shrank to $1.6
billion at the end of 1989 from $2.3 billion a year earlier.
   Until now, some Salomon executives had believed that if
commodity prices would follow a sustained trend, rather than
trading in a narrow range as they are now, Philipp Brothers
could earn as much as $50 million a year before taxes. And
they noted that most of the Philipp Brothers' losses are on
paper; that is, they represent open trading positions that
have been marked to market and haven't been closed out.
Theoretically, the unit's fortunes could turn around and many
of the paper losses be reversed. But this isn't likely,
analysts said, unless there is a sustained bull market in
commodities prices.
   Last year, Philipp Brothers took big hits in cocoa
trading. It blamed the 1990 first-quarter loss on unspecified
trades in nonferrous metals, a group that includes copper,
aluminum, nickel, tin and zinc. In the second quarter, the
culprit was trading in agricultural commodities.
   Still, the choice of what to do with Philipp Brothers
isn't easy. Leaving the commodities business would be
expensive, Salomon executives said, primarily because of the
need to liquidate positions and realize losses. And while
selling Philipp Brothers has been talked about, the big
unanswered question is to whom.
   One benefit of folding Philipp Brothers into either Phibro
or Salomon Brothers Inc., the big securities subsidiary,
would be that Salomon Inc. could hide Philipp's recent bleak
results, some analysts said.
   "At some point, this segment could be rolled up into
either Phibro's or Salomon Brothers' operations or divested,"
a Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst, Dean Eberling, said
in a recent report. "Some pieces of the business could
remain, while a major portion gets sold or discontinued."
   What has particularly hurt Salomon is that Philipp
Brothers' results have tarred what otherwise have been
impressive earnings in the firm's securities and energy
segments. Despite the second-quarter bloodbath at Philipp
Brothers, for example, Salomon's net income was $120 million.
   Philipp's losses are throwing a wrench into analysts'
expectations. When anticipating Salomon Inc.'s earnings,
Wertheim Schroder's Mr. Hanbury said he now routinely plugs
in losses of as much as $35 million a quarter for Philipp
Brothers, compared with $10 million to $15 million in the
past. "I work my estimates from there," he said.
