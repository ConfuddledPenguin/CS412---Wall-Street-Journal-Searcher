   The contest to take over Australian coal miner Oakbridge
Ltd. intensified as National Mutual Life Association of
Australasia Ltd. withdrew its acceptance of Elders Resources
NZFP Ltd.'s offer.
   Independent directors of Oakbridge told Oakbridge holders
who had already accepted Elders Resources' conditional offer
they can withdraw their acceptance if Elders Resources
doesn't achieve compulsory acquisition of all Oakbridge
shares.

   Elders Resources is attempting to fend off a rival bid
from a Japanese-Australian consortium led by TNT Ltd.'s coal
mining associate McIlwraith McEacharn Ltd. McIlwraith leads a
consortium with Nippon Oil Ltd. and Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd.
that wants to take over Elders Resources' controlling stake
in Oakbridge.
   McIlwraith raised its bid for Oakbridge this week to 91
Australian cents (72 U.S. cents) a share from A88 cents a
share. Elders Resources then lifted its conditional bid to
A91 cents a share.
   Elders Resources is offering A88 cents a share, as well as
a conditional A91 cents a share if it reaches the 90%
acceptance level required for compulsory acquisition of the
shares outstanding.
   National Mutual withdrew its acceptance of Elders
Resources' offer for National Mutual's 3.5% stake in
Oakbridge.
