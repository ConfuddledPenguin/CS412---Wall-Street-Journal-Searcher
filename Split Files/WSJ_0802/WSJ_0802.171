   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $54 billion, five-year
farm bill after voting to tighten limits on subsidies to
individual farmers.
   The omnibus legislation, adopted 327-91 last night, would
end the steady decline in farm-income supports under the
expiring 1985 farm law and would renew the major commodity
programs without any sharp departures in policy.

   The overwhelming vote was a victory for farm-bloc
lawmakers led by Agriculture Committee chairman Kika de la
Garza (D., Texas), who beat back or blunted repeated attempts
to cut farm spending and revamp several subsidy programs,
including sugar and peanuts.
   Earlier in the day, the House rejected a plan by Rep.
Silvio Conte (R., Mass.) to close loopholes in current
subsidy limits that let farmers collect as much as $500,000
annually from the government. Instead, the lawmakers adopted
a less restrictive amendment offered by Rep. Jerry Huckaby
(D., La.) that would put a $200,000 cap on cash subsidies and
other income supports paid to a single farmer.
   The House, in another minor concession to a coalition of
conservative Republicans and urban Democrats who sought to
overhaul the subsidy programs, adopted a plan to reduce the
maximum annual payment to individual beekeepers to $100,000
in 1995 from $250,000. The Senate has voted to phase out
honey subsidies altogether by 1995.
   Differences between the House and Senate versions of the
1990 farm bill will be reconciled in conference after
Congress returns from its August recess. The Bush
administration has threatened to veto the legislation unless
significant cuts are made in commodity and food-stamp
outlays. The House bill would increase spending on food
stamps and other nutrition programs by $5 billion over the
next five years. The Senate didn't include a food-stamp
provision in its bill.
   The House bill, among other things, would give farmers the
option to plant a variety of crops on 25% of the acreage they
customarily devote to subsidized crops. But farmers who take
advantage of this flexibility provision wouldn't qualify for
any subsidies on that land. The lawmakers' aim is to let
farmers make planting decisions in response to market demand,
rather than incentives created by the subsidy programs.
   The measure would freeze target prices for wheat, feed
grains, cotton and rice for the next five years, and it would
create a marketing loan for oil-seed crops, including
soybeans and sunflowers. Such loans are designed to prevent
the buildup of government-owned surpluses by promoting
exports. In addition, the bill would impose a dairy floor
price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk, and it would
require the government to adopt supply controls if
dairy-product surpluses exceed six billion pounds.
   Under the environment provisions of the mammoth bill, the
nation's Conservation Reserve for highly erodible land would
be expanded to 45 million acres from the current authorized
level of 40 million to include environmentally sensitive
land. The bill would also create a national agricultural
wetlands reserve by obtaining federal easements on prairie
"potholes" and other habitats for migratory waterfowl.
   In addition, the measure would revise controversial parts
of the so-called swamp-buster law, which regulates the
conversion of wetlands to agriculture. Farmers would be
allowed to drain wetlands that hamper farming operations as
long as they restore former wetlands of equal or larger size.
They also could drain small wetlands of minimal value to
wildlife. The bill would impose graduated fines for
inadvertent swamp-buster violations.
