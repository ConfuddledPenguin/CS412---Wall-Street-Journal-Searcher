   WASHINGTON -- The House, ignoring a veto threat, approved
an omnibus housing bill that would significantly increase
federal spending for public housing programs.
   The bill, which passed on a 378-43 vote, would allocate
$28 billion for housing programs for fiscal 1991, $10 billion
more than the Senate approved last month in its bill.

   The White House said yesterday that President Bush would
veto the legislation in its current form because it is too
costly and doesn't address the administration's concerns over
the health of the Federal Housing Administration.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp argued
that the House measure doesn't require adequate up-front
insurance premiums for first-time home buyers and that it
fails to provide sufficient capital requirements for the FHA.
   Under the House bill, $19.4 billion would be allocated for
existing nonrural housing programs and $2.1 billion for
modernization. The bill also provides $500 million for a new
program to subsidize interest rates so first-time home buyers
would pay a maximum interest rate of 6%.
   In addition, the bill would provide $310 million for a new
program to assist public housing residents in buying their
government-owned homes, a provision also included in the
Senate bill. The House bill also would authorize $300 million
for the construction of new rental housing, a provision
opposed by the administration.
   Another provision of the House bill that differs
significantly from the Senate version is the restructuring of
the FHA loan program. An amendment introduced by Rep. Bruce
Vento (D., Minn.) and Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.) would phase
out over five years the 3.8% up-front insurance premium,
requiring instead that a payment of 1.35% of the value of the
mortgage be paid at the time of the settlement and that 0.6%
be paid over the life of the loan. The Senate measure retains
the current 3.8% up-front insurance requirement. The Senate
bill also requires that two-thirds of the closing costs be
paid up front, a provision not required by the House bill.
   In a letter to Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman
of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs,
Mr. Kemp wrote: "Should a bill containing the Vento-Ridge
amendment or a similarly unacceptable proposal reach the
president's desk, I and the president's other senior advisers
would recommend that it be vetoed."
   But Mary Brunette, an assistant to Secretary Kemp, said
the administration was hopeful that a compromise could be
reached in the conference committee. "The administration
would be willing to accept higher spending if the conference
report more closely resembles the Senate bill," she said.
