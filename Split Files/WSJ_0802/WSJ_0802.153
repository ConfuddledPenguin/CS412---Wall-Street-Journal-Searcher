   General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn., said its
Electrical Distribution &amp; Control unit would eliminate 60
jobs next year at its Bloomington, Ill., plant.
   The unit will move distribution activities now located in
Bloomington to a national distribution center in Knoxville,
Tenn. About 20 of the affected positions are expected to be
reduced through attrition and early retirement, the company
said. The remainder of the workers will be offered a variety
of severance benefits.

   The company also said it would spend $2 million over the
next two years to boost manufacturing capability in the
Bloomington plant. About 450 people now work there, making
parts for products that regulate the flow of electricity.
