   A LOAN FOR BANGLADESH

   Bangladesh has secured its first major commercial loan and
thus may have improved the chances for attracting additional
foreign investment.
   The $100 million loan is part of a $435 million financing
package for a fertilizer plant that is expected to increase
substantially the country's exports when it is completed in
three years. The package also includes a complex mix of
foreign-export credits, government concessions, investments
by equity partners and political-risk insurance.
   Citicorp International Ltd., the Hong Kong arm of the U.S.
bank, coordinated the loan, which involves the participation
of 10 banks. Bankers say it was the project's merits rather
than new-found confidence in Bangladesh's economy that
persuaded them to make the loan.
   The Bangladesh Parliament passed a bill granting
citizenship to foreign nationals who deposit $1 million or
more in a Bangladeshi financial institution.
                                                                                                       

   HELPING SOUTH KOREA'S FARMERS
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean government strongly opposes the opening
of its agricultural markets to foreign exporters, a top Seoul
official said. Lee Kie Choo, assistant foreign minister for
economic affairs, said the country has a fragile and
vulnerable farming sector requiring protection for some time
to come. He said he doubted the government would open the
rice market to imports within 10 years.
                                                                                                       

   PARIS METRO CRACKDOWN

   The operators of the Paris Metro said they would clear the
subway system's corridors of the 2,000 vendors who illegally
sell wares to commuters from makeshift stands. A Metro
spokeswoman said transit-authority police would seize the
fruit, sunglasses and plastic toys offered for sale by the
vendors, who are mainly Third World immigrants. Prior
attempts had failed because the sellers had only been served
with summonses that they often failed to pay, she said.
                                                                                                       

   INDIAN CRASH REPORT
                                                                                                       

   Pilot error and lack of guidance from air-traffic
controllers led to the 1988 crash of an Indian Airlines plane
that killed all but two of the 135 people on board, a report
said. An Indian news agency quoted the report from a
government-appointed inquiry as saying there was no
structural or mechanical failure involved in the crash of the
17-year-old jet. The Boeing 737, on a flight from Bombay to
the western state of Gujarat, crashed in fog while
approaching the airport.
                                                                                                       

   A SUMMIT IN VENICE
                                                                                                       

   Meeting in Venice, the leaders of Italy, Czechoslovakia,
Austria, Hungary and Yugoslavia reached a wide range of
accords, most of which involved improving transportation
links among the countries. The five nations are members of
the Pentagonal Initiative, a regional alliance founded in
Budapest last November. Officials said the alliance could
bring East European countries closer to the European
Community and act as a counterweight to a unified Germany.
                                                                                                       

   HONDA'S CHINA PLANS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Honda Motor Co. is expanding its
motorcycle-service network in China and establishing
technical schools there for mechanics. Honda, which ranks
first in the world in motorcycle sales, now has service
centers in four Chinese cities. It plans to join three
Chinese motorcycle companies in setting up an extensive
service network throughout the country. Over the past three
years, the number of motorcycles in China doubled to about
five million units, Honda said.
                                                                                                       

   DEFENDING AUSTRALIA
                                                                                                       

   Australians have an underlying fear of foreign invasion,
and partly privatizing the nation's defense force could help
allay concern, according to a report by the Australian
Defense Department.
   The report, part of a drive to involve the public in
defense matters, seeks formation of a new militia and the
transfer to civilians of jobs now held by the military.
   "If our strategic outlook were to deteriorate, the
underlying paranoia Australians still harbor about foreign
attack could reappear," the report said. It said further that
actively involving Australia's civilians should end "the
malaise which causes many in the community to feel their
country cannot be defended."
   The report recommended cutting regular army, navy and
air-force strength to 47,000 from nearly 70,000, supplemented
by a 52,000-member militia conscripted for short-term
military roles. The number of civilians doing work for the
defense force on contract, such as warehousing and food
supply, would be raised to 38,000 from 15,000.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A survey of 500 Japanese business people visiting the
information museum of IBM Japan in Tokyo showed that Japanese
workers generally feel uneasy about taking long summer
vacations. Four out of five said they worried that a lot of
work would be piled up when they returned to their office
after a vacation and one in four said they phoned their
office to ask how work was going during their holidays. . . .
Italy's Undersecretary of Finance Stefano De Luca, responding
to a query in Parliament as to why the government was
ignoring prostitutes' earnings, explained that prostitution
isn't a recognized profession on tax forms and thus isn't
subject to income or sale taxes.
