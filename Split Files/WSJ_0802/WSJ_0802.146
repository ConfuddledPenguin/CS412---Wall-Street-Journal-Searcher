   Time Warner Inc. formed a sports-marketing company to
acquire rights to a range of sports-related events and
products for use within the entertainment and media company's
cable-TV, home video, magazine and other operations.
   Time Warner named Seth G. Abraham president and chief
executive of the new Time Warner Sports unit. Mr. Abraham,
42, had been senior vice president of sports and programming
at HBO. His successor at HBO hasn't been named.

   Time Warner "didn't really have a corporate blueprint" for
acquisition of licenses, Mr. Abraham said. "No one architect
was responsible for putting all the pieces together. Various
divisions were out in the marketplace buying rights. It made
more sense" to form one organization under one executive.
"I'm the lucky or unlucky victim," he said.
