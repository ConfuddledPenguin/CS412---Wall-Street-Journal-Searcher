   Commercialize Professors' Discoveries

   More than 100 American universities have started financing
new companies to exploit their researchers' discoveries, and
others are expected to join the trend.
   This has created opportunities for entrepreneurs who want
to make money commercializing academic research -- and for
professors who want to make a bundle.

   Until recently, only a few institutions, such as
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford
University, aggressively marketed their research, largely by
licensing the technology to others.
   But a federal law four years ago gave universities far
greater rights to profit from the fruits of federally funded
research. Since then, universities have been gleefully
establishing venture-capital pools, technology-development
companies and research groups to make money.
   Unlike earlier efforts, the new programs commonly call for
the university to own pieces of the new ventures or to be
formally involved in an outside entity that invests in them.
Researchers who developed the technology being sold often get
a share of the action.
   All told, about $750 million, including federal and state
funds, has been made available for such efforts.
   "Many universities are recognizing that their research
base has more commercial value than they realized," says
Alistair Brett, director of technology management and
transfer at Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State
University, Blacksburg. But the ventures go beyond producing
revenue. Universities "are hoping that commercialization
efforts will expand their contact with corporations and also
promote regional economic development," he says.
   Iowa State University is one such school. With an annual
research budget of over $110 million and over 2,500 research
projects, the school figures that it can create a number of
businesses that will generate new revenue and new jobs, says
Michael Crow, director of the Institute for Physical Research
and Technology, a group of 10 research centers at the
university.
   Mr. Crow's organization, in conjunction with a
biotechnology program, now keeps track of all Iowa State
research and even helps obtain patents when needed. The
University's Center for Advanced Technology Developments
checks the potential of a technology.
   In the last three years, the center has started 20
projects, of which 17 are still operating. One of those is
Ames Specialty Metals Co., a company controlled by private
investors that plans to make a new alloy to produce permanent
magnets. To test the economic viability of the Iowa State
research, which was funded by the Department of Energy, the
center built a pilot manufacturing plant for $800,000.
   When it was determined that the company could produce on a
larger scale, the center helped estimate manufacturing costs
and created financial models for a business plan. Edge
Technologies Inc., a local high-tech investment company,
later provided $500,000 and recruited an executive to help
start a full-fledged operation, which began last December.
   The University of Texas is taking a different approach.
Four years ago, its Southwestern Medical Center helped
establish Dallas Biomedical Corp. as a private, for-profit
company with $12.5 million in equity from Southwest
Enterprise Associates, a Dallas venture capital firm, and
Dallas investors. Southwestern Medical Center retains a stake
in the company.
   One of the companies developed by Dallas Biomedical is
GeneScreen Inc. It developed a DNA analysis system for
personal identification and for testing individuals'
susceptibility to certain diseases. Dallas Biomedical
invested in testing to determine whether the system worked.
It then raised $3.75 million for a start-up that would market
the technology. GeneScreen, which currently earns most of its
revenue from contract work for forensic labs, expects to
break even this year and produce a profit next year.
   Some universities are forming joint projects with other
institutions. The University of Chicago has teamed up with
Argonne National Laboratory to create Argonne-Chicago
Development Corp., or Arch. The not-for-profit corporation
will develop and market inventions produced by scientists at
the two institutions.
   Amid the rush to market inventions, many universities
worry that commercialism could taint research and lead to
financial conflicts of interest. To counter such criticism,
Johns Hopkins University and the Johns Hopkins Health Systems
established an independent technology-development enterprise,
Dome Corp., in 1985. Through a business development incubator
and a $5 million seed fund, Dome will select projects with
commercial potential. It then will help sell the technology
or create companies that can market their products.
   Dome won't have exclusive rights to the research; it will
have to bid for rights along with other interested parties,
says James McComas, president and chief executive officer of
Dome. And because the commercialization will be conducted by
researchers employed by Dome, "we should avoid many of the
sticky conflict issues some institutions face," he says.
   Because the new university programs are so young, it is
unclear whether they will significantly boost university
revenue or create many viable businesses. But administrators
expect more universities to attempt the strategy. Says Mr.
Brett of Virginia Polytechnic: "All you need is a large
enough research base. You don't have to be an MIT or a
Stanford."
