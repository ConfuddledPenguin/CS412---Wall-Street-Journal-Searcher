   JERUSALEM -- U.S. Jewish organizations see a lot at stake
in the first few weeks of Yitzhak Shamir's hardline
coalition.
   The new government takes power at a time of great strain
in U.S.-Israel relations. "If this were America, we'd give
him 100 days before making any judgments, but this being the
Middle East, we can't afford that much time," says Harry
Wall, Israel director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith.

   Mr. Shamir's government has pledged to pursue peace talks
with Palestinians, but it also vows to crush Arab opposition
in the West Bank and Gaza, bolster Jewish settlements there
and isolate the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Mr. Shamir says his first priority is speeding up the flow
of Soviet Jewish immigrants and their absorption into Israeli
life. Arab states say the massive influx of Soviets threatens
to push Palestinians off their lands.
   "American Jews are worried that within this government are
voices of extreme positions," says Naphtali Lavi,
director-general of the United Jewish Appeal's Israel
operation. Ariel Sharon, the new housing minister with
special responsibility for Soviet immigration, has called for
massive force to put down the uprising. Others in the new
government favor mass deportations of Palestinians from
Israeli-occupied lands.
   The Israeli Labor Party, now in opposition, has branded
Mr. Shamir's government as "anti-Israel" and a "national
disaster." But U.S. Jewish groups are treading more
cautiously.
   "The Cassandras are saying this is going to lead to war,"
says Ronald Kronish, director of the American Jewish
Committee, "but personally I don't think hysteria is very
useful." In a memorandum to members, Mr. Kronish included a
reminder that many people greeted the election of Menachem
Begin in the early 1970s with hysteria but that Mr. Begin
went on to achieve peace with Egypt.
   Mr. Wall says Mr. Shamir's task will be "to galvanize and
reassure the center. He doesn't want to head the government
that wrecked relations with the U.S. or stopped the flow of
Soviet immigrants." Both those things could happen, says Mr.
Wall, if Mr. Shamir allows the drive to populate the "whole
land of Israel" to run rampant.
   If, on the contrary, he manages the immigration well, his
Likud Bloc could be rewarded by an additional five or six
Knesset seats when the Soviet immigrants first go to the
polls at the next election. And that could be soon. While the
government theoretically has until 1992 before the next
election, the current coalition may prove too fragile to
survive that long. Mr. Shamir has managed to knit together
only 62 of 120 Knesset seats, many of them from small groups
with differing agendas.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. administration will be dealing with
David Levy, a foreign minister without previous experience in
diplomacy or foreign affairs, who recently riled U.S.
officials when, as housing minister, he secretly channeled
government funds to Jewish extremists for the purchase of a
building in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem.
   However, Mr. Levy also has some dovish credentials, having
voted for withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. On
Israel's equivalent of Memorial Day, the Moroccan-born Mr.
Levy sometimes attends services in Arab villages for Druze
and Bedouin soldiers who died fighting for Israel. Until
recently, he had a reputation as being somewhat inaccessible
to U.S. Jewish groups. But after the Jerusalem controversy,
he met with some representatives for an hour and a half, and
stressed his appreciation of, and concern for, U.S. support.
   Some Israelis say Mr. Levy is the Likud's best orator,
with a style resembling that of the charismatic Mr. Begin.
But few Americans will be able to judge for themselves
because his English is poor. To the UJA's Mr. Lavi,
appointing such a representative is "somehow tragic" given
the delicate state of relations. "You need somebody there who
can straighten things out with the Americans, and neither he
nor Shamir can do it. If they go on TV they won't come across
well," he says.
   But the ADL's Mr. Wall believes that who the government is
will prove far less important in the long run than what it
does. "American Jewry's support for this country isn't tied
to one government," he says.
