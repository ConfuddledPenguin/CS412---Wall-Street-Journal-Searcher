   Ingenico S.A., a French electrical engineering company,
said it formed a joint venture with a unit of Ing. C.
Olivetti &amp; Co. of Italy to develop and market electronic
payment systems.
   The venture, Eurosix S.p.A., in which Ingenico and
Olivetti's Sixcom will each have 50% stakes, intends to
develop a new standard for the electronic payment markets
that can be used for bank transactions, commerce and
distribution networks. It will focus on systems using
electronic teller or credit cards, and is expected to start
operations in 1991, focusing on the banking market in Europe
initially. Ingenico and Olivetti expect the joint unit's
annual revenue to reach at least 110 billion lire ($88.1
million) between 1991 and 1994.

   The partnership also may lead to cooperation in
telecommunications and security. Ingenico said it wants to
tap Olivetti's marketing and distribution acumen in foreign
markets. The venture will be able to take advantage of the
sales infrastructure established by Olivetti Networks &amp;
Systems in the countries where Olivetti is active, Ingenico
said.
