   HEWLETT-PACKARD Co. says use of a non-Hewlett toner in its
laser printers does not, by itself, affect the overall
warranty on the printer. "However," the company says, "if an
HP LaserJet failure or damage is found to be directly
attributable to the use of a non-Hewlett toner cartridge,
Hewlett will not repair the printer free-of-charge."
Wednesday's Form + Function column said Hewlett "warns that
anyone who uses refilled toner may void the warranty."
