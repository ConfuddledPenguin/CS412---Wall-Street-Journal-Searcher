   NEW YORK -- Blue-chip and growth stocks advanced sharply
yesterday as investors began their ritual of sprucing up
portfolios before the quarter's end.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered nearly all of
its 38.59-point net loss of last week, advancing 30.19
yesterday to 2892.57.

   Stock-index arbitrage buy programs, especially in the
Major Market Index, which mimics the industrial average,
helped push up many blue-chip issues sharply. "There was an
explosion in buy programs limited to 20 stocks," said Thomas
Gallagher, head of Oppenheimer's block trading department.
   Broader market measures lagged behind the industrial
average. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.92 to
361.63; the gain was equivalent to a 21-point rise in the Dow
industrials. The New York Stock Exchange composite index went
up 1.37 to 197.42 and the Dow Jones Equity Market index rose
2.51 to 336.89. Advancing issues outpaced decliners on the
New York Stock Exchange, 918 to 563. Big Board volume totaled
only 119,550,000 shares.
   Although investors loaded up on blue chips such as Boeing
and Chevron, and growth stocks such as Home Depot, they also
sold some financial stocks they don't want to show on the
books at quarter's end.
   Boeing soared 3 1/2 to 58 1/2 and led the list of
most-active Big Board issues, as 2.3 million shares changed
hands. As expected, Korean Airlines made commitments for 23
of the company's 747-400 jumbo jets; the pact, valued at $4.8
billion, represents the third large order Boeing has received
from Asia in recent weeks.
   Among growth issues: Walt Disney jumped 3 1/4 to 126 5/8,
Wal-Mart Stores rose 1 to 60 3/8, Gap Inc. gained 1 7/8 to 58
and Home Depot rallied 2 to 58 3/4.
   Energy stocks, which were battered last week as oil prices
fell sharply, rebounded on bargain hunting. Exxon gained 7/8
to 47 7/8, Chevron rose 1 1/8 to 70 5/8, Texaco went up 3/8
to 57 7/8, Amoco climbed 7/8 to 51 1/2 and Mobil gained 5/8
to 62. In the oil field-services group, Schlumberger rose 3/8
to 56 5/8, Halliburton climbed 1/2 to 45 7/8 and Baker Hughes
added 7/8 to 27 7/8.
   One exception was Unocal, which dropped 1/4 to 28 3/4.
Union Exploration Partners, in which the company has a stake
of about 95%, skidded 2 1/4 to 16 after disclosing plans to
convert from a partnership form of ownership into a
corporation.
   Financial shares, which attracted strong buying interest
in recent weeks, were sold by many investors who are
forecasting a slower decline in interest rates than
previously expected, according to one trader. Citicorp fell
1/2 to 23 1/2 on 1.1 million shares; Chase Manhattan declined
1/2 to 26 1/2. American Express, a stock in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, fell 1/8 to 30 5/8.
   Dividend-related trading swelled volume in Occidental
Petroleum, which rose 3/8 to 27 and ranked second on the
most-active list at 1.6 million shares. The stock has a
dividend yield of 9.3%; shareholders of record yesterday will
get the company's next quarterly payout.
   Environmental Systems fell 2 to 12 3/4. Arizona's governor
asked state regulators to extend the period for public
comments on the company's request for a permit to operate a
hazardous-waste treatment plant.
   HomeFed gained 1 1/4 to 33 5/8. Justin Mamis, a technical
analyst at Gordon Capital, recommended the issue; last week,
analysts at Montgomery Securities and Dean Witter Reynolds
reiterated their buy recommendations.
   Foxboro climbed 1 1/2 to 30. The company said it is
exploring the possibility of a strategic alliance, which may
involve the sale of an equity stake or the entire company.
   H.H. Robertson added 5/8 to 11 7/8. USA Today reported
that a group headed by New York investor Douglas Kass is
expected to offer about $15 a share, or $100 million, for the
company this week.
   Manville slid 3/8 to 7 1/8. The chairman of the trust
established by the company for the settlement of
asbestos-related claims said the trust is exploring the
possible sale of Manville stock as one of several
alternatives for dealing with a cash shortfall.
   Floating Point Systems remained unchanged at 1 3/4. The
company signed a letter of intent to sell $14.5 million of a
new series of convertible preferred stock to an institutional
investor, which wasn't identified.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.15
to 362.32. Volume totaled 9,360,000 shares.
   Sierra Health Services went down 3/4 to 6 5/8. A jury
ruled against the company in a class-action suit over alleged
securities law violations and ordered that Sierra pay a $6.5
million settlement.
