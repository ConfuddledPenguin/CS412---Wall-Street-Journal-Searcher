   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. -- As part of a continuing push among
fast-food outlets to offer healthier foods, Hardee's Food
Systems Inc., a unit of Imasco Ltd. in Montreal, is expected
to announce today that it is introducing a quarter-pound
hamburger with less fat than conventional patties.
   The fast-food restaurant chain's new "Lean 1" burger will
have 18 grams of total fat, including garnish of lettuce,
tomato, pickle, onion and ketchup. According to Hardee's,
that compares with 20.7 grams of fat in McDonald's Corp.'s
"Quarter Pounder" burger, without garnish; and 36 grams in a
Whopper sandwich, with garnish, from Burger King Corp., a
unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC.

   Hardee's began testing the new hamburger in May in cities
in Illinois, South Carolina and Alabama. The company expects
the product to be offered nationwide by year end.
