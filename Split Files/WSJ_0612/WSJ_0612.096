   LA JOLLA, Calif. -- Triton Group Ltd. posted a fiscal
first-quarter loss of $12.8 million, or $1.01 a share, and
said that it expects a net loss for the full year ending Jan.
31, 1991.
   In the year-ago quarter, Triton had a loss of $730,000, or
seven cents a share. Revenue in the quarter ended April 30
rose 70% to $72.3 million from $42.6 million, mainly
reflecting the acquisition of a majority interest in liquor
retailer Liquor Barn Inc. in October.

   Triton said its widened loss reflects higher interest
expense and amortization of acquisition costs for Liquor Barn
and restaurant chain Western Sizzlin Inc., in which Triton
acquired a majority stake in 1988, as well as a markdown of
certain security investments. Triton said its $140 million
investment in Fuqua Industries Inc., a consumer-products and
services concern, returned less than 5% in the quarter on an
annualized basis.
   "Except for the nonrecurring investment write-downs, our
operating results . . . were close to plan," said Charles R.
Scott, chairman and chief executive officer. "We knew when
(the) Western Sizzlin and Liquor Barn (stakes) were acquired
that interest costs and amortization would result in losses
during the building phase."
   Triton, a diversified holding company, said that its other
two majority-owned businesses are operating profitably,
although "the effects of the softening economy are beginning
to appear." The first-quarter operating performance of Fuqua,
in which the company holds a 24% stake, improved.
   "We believe that most of Triton's bad news is over, but
because of the new acquisitions, we do not expect the company
to be profitable at the bottom line for fiscal 1991," Mr.
Scott said. Intermark Inc., also based in La Jolla, owns 52%
of Triton's stock and the two firms recently agreed to merge,
pending various approvals.
