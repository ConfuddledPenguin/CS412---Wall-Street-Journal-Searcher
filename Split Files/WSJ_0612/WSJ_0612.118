   Canadian Pacific Ltd., Montreal, said it won't proceed
with a proposed distribution to common shareholders of 80% of
its Marathon Realty Co. real estate unit.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Canadian Pacific rose 12.5 cents to $19.25.

   Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court of Ontario blocked the
proposed 767 million Canadian dollar ($653 million) spinoff,
ruling that the proposed distribution was unfair to holders
of preferred shares, who weren't included in the transaction.
   With the Marathon plan dead analysts said shareholders
expect the transportation, energy and natural resources
company to take other actions to increase the value of its
stock. "The onus is on them to do something," said Jeffrey
Putterman, an analyst with County NatWest Securities Corp. in
New York.
   The measures could include a share buy-back or asset
sales, analysts said. A Canadian Pacific spokesman wouldn't
comment on the company's plans. He added that "we don't have
specific plans to reinstate" the Marathon distribution.
