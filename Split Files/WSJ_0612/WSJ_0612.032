   While attention has focused on the potentially
inflationary effects of currency conversion between East and
West Germany, the greatest challenge will be the creation of
jobs to assuage the large-scale dislocation and unemployment
a united Germany will face.
   Forecasts of unemployment triggered by German
reunification, plant modernizations and the abandonment of
nonproductive, noncompetitive activities, irrespective of
cyclical conditions, range from 500,000 to two million
workers. Yet West Germany's dismal job-creation record during
the past two decades has been generally overlooked.

   Blinded by West Germany's export performance, inflation
control and overall growth, observers seem impervious to the
fact that during the 1970s, overall employment grew a paltry
1.6%. Over the 1980-88 period, overall employment rose a mere
1.8%. During this time the annual rate of employment growth
in the U.S. exceeded West Germany's 10-year growth rate, with
the U.S. creating, on average, more than two million net jobs
per year.
   During the past few years, it has become widely recognized
that West Germany's inability to create jobs was attributable
to the numerous legislative and regulatory constraints that
limit hiring and firing flexibility and sharply increase the
cost of labor relative to other factors. High levels of job
protection and benefits favor those who are already employed
and restrict dismissals. As labor has come to be seen more as
a fixed cost than a variable cost, employers tend to
substitute capital for labor.
   Clearly, if you can't fire, you hire more cautiously. If
you can't shift workers around relatively freely, you do not
take the risk of increasing employment. In a similar vein,
workers who are confident of not losing their jobs have no
incentive to adjust their wage demands.
   There have been recent attempts to make West German labor
markets more flexible. Employers now have more latitude on
dismissals and can also make increased use of fixed-term
contracts. Despite these ameliorations, the question remains
as to how such a rigid apparatus of labor and social
legislation and regulation is likely to affect job creation
in East Germany.
   Unification will vastly expand the supply of labor and of
the unemployed. Whether the demand for labor will be vigorous
enough to mitigate the immense absorption problem this
suggests is another matter. Unlike the Turkish guest workers,
these unemployed cannot be sent home.
   Much rests on Germany's ability to introduce flexibility
in work rules, dismissals and wages. One would expect
unification to cause West German wages to ratchet downward,
but why should that be when workers enjoy full job protection
and security?
   Likewise, West German union pressures as well as job and
social benefits will put a floor on East German wages, which,
in any event, will ratchet upward. Imposing on an economy in
such dire need of adjustment as East Germany's a labor-market
structure that has even discouraged job creation in a country
as dynamic as West Germany is indeed a very hazardous
proposition.
   The problem is all the more compelling given that recent
trends suggest that those West German firms that are most
eager to expand into the East German market are small and
medium-sized firms. Many such firms had found access to West
German capital markets difficult and international expansion
too daunting. East Germany, however, is an appealing market
for them. But without flexible rules, their expansion plans
could be in serious jeopardy.
   In the U.S. it was small and medium-sized enterprises that
accounted for more than 75% of the jobs created during the
past two decades. Such firms provide another crucial
contribution to an economy such as East Germany's. There is
no better model for emulation and stimulation of
entrepreneurial initiative than successful small and
medium-sized concerns. While attention is turned to the
privatization of large-scale enterprise, the contribution of
small and medium-sized firms to competition and economic
dynamism tends to be overlooked.
   It is often argued that co-determination and pension
benefits were essential in shaping the social contract that
was a basis of West Germany's success after World War II. But
it is also widely acknowledged that the legislation and
regulations gradually grafted on the West German economy as
the country became more prosperous would have been
stultifying had they been imposed lock, stock and barrel four
decades ago. And even in a country as rich as West Germany,
they became excessively constraining, at least as far as job
creation is concerned.
   To now strap an economy in need of tremendous structural
adjustment and employment growth in such a straitjacket of
regulation would be a disastrous mistake. Some mechanism must
be found to ease the rules and regulations governing the
German labor market at least for a fairly lengthy transition
period.
   There have been signs that the availability of low-paid
East German workers already may have damped some of the
demands of West German unions. Last month, for example, West
Germany's most powerful union, I.G. Metall, backed down from
demands for an 8.5% wage increase and a 35-hour week, settled
for a 6% wage hike and stuck with the 38 1/2-hour week.
   This seemingly more conciliatory attitude is not solely a
by-product of unification. For the past few years, as in most
industrialized countries, membership as well as political
support for unions in West Germany has been waning. Moreover,
the combination of German unification and the movement toward
a more unified European market in 1992 have raised the issue
of German international competitiveness and adaptability.
   In searching for ways to ease the transition for East
Germany, Germany as a whole might seize the opportunity to
push for more flexible and less costly work rules. The timing
and mood couldn't be better, as cracks are beginning to
appear in the once comfy relationship among West German
government, industry and labor.
