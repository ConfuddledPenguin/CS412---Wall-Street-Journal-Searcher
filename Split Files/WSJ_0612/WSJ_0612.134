   NEW YORK -- After opening lower, the bond market spent the
remainder of the day retracing the declines to end
essentially unchanged.
   Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds began to fall during
overnight trading in Japan, as several large institutional
investors sold bonds to take profits. By the time trading
began in the U.S., prices of the benchmark 30-year bond were
1/4 point lower, or down $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount.

   But prices recovered during U.S. trading as domestic money
managers started "bottom-fishing," said William Sullivan,
director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. He said the buying was encouraged by a stronger dollar.
   When the value of the dollar rises against other
currencies, the value of securities denominated in dollars
also rises. Because the value of the dollar increased
yesterday while bond prices fell, some investors viewed
prices as relatively cheap.
   "We saw buyers throughout the day," said James Capra, a
vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
He said the ratio of buyers to sellers yesterday was
four-to-one.
   Trading, however, was slow yet again. In fact, the bond
market has barely budged since June 1, when a
weaker-than-expected May employment report caused long-term
bond prices to climb more than 1 1/2 points.
   Dealers and analysts said the slow pace of trading
reflects the cautious stance that many investors are taking
ahead of several key economic reports due to be released
later this week.
   "People are waiting for the data deluge," said Elliott
Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. On Wednesday, the Department of Commerce
will release retail sales for May. More importantly, two key
barometers of inflation -- the producer price index and the
consumer price index -- will be released on Thursday and
Friday, respectively.
   "Whether prices break out of these ranges will depend most
importantly on the PPI and CPI," said Mr. Platt.
   Traders and analysts said the back-to-back inflation
reports should help to determine whether the Federal Reserve
will loosen its grip on credit in the near future and allow
interest rates to fall.
   Mr. Platt said that a CPI and PPI of more than 0.4% for
the month of May, would be a clear sign "to the bond market
that the Fed will not ease."
   Conversely, if those data show an increase of 0.2% or
less, "a case could be made for a Fed ease," said Mr. Platt.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury prices were little changed to slightly lower
yesterday. The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103
7/32 compared with 103 9/32 on Friday. The issue's yield was
essentially unchanged at 8.44%. Ten-year notes ended
unchanged at a price of 102 20/32 to yield 8.46%.
   At the government's weekly Treasury bill auction, the
average discount rate for three-month bills was set at 7.73%
while the average rate for six-month bills was set at 7.64%.
The rates were up from last week's auction when they were
7.69% and 7.62%, respectively.
   In the agency market, the Federal Home Loan Banks said it
will price $1.34 billion of notes today.
   The three-part offering will consist of $365 million
one-year bonds, $570 million two-year bonds and $400 million
four-year bonds.
   An agency trader said the early talk is that the FHLB
notes will be priced at yields that are 0.05 to 0.20
percentage point above yields on comparable Treasury
securities.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Consolidated Rail Corp. revisited the credit markets
yesterday and received the same enthusiastic response from
investors that it did during its first trip last month.
   Conrail, the Philadelphia-based freight railroad, sold
$550 million of 30-year debentures, which were priced to
yield 9.85% through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
The offering came less than two weeks after Conrail sold $250
million of 10-year notes to a sellout crowd of institutional
investors.
   "We were looking to do $300 million but the issue was
priced so well that we decided to do it all," said John
McKelvey, Conrail's treasurer. Mr. McKelvey said the debt
offering "essentially completes the financing related to the
company's recapitalization."
   In the junk bond market, the bonds of Trump Taj Mahal
Funding and other casinos operated by real estate developer
Donald Trump rose on news that Mr. Trump reached an agreement
with bankers that gives him time and money to restructure his
holdings.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding's 14% bonds ended two points
higher at 59 on the American Stock Exchange. Trump Castle's
13.75% bond closed up one point at 60 1/2 while Trump Plaza
Funding's 12 7/8% bonds added one point to end at 84.
   Last week, the bonds plummeted on news that Mr. Trump was
having cash-flow problems.
   In trading, most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to
slightly lower. Most junk bonds, speculative-grade securities
with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, closed
unchanged to about 1/8 point higher.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A lackadaisical municipal market ended unchanged to off
1/4 point.
   In new issue activity, two California short-term deals
were priced via competitive bid.
   A Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group won $85 million of
San Bernardino County tax and revenue anticipation notes,
which were priced to yield 5.98%, and a Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding group won $50 million of Fresno County tax
and revenue anticipation notes, which were priced to yield
5.80%.
   The San Bernardino notes are rated MIG-1 by Moody's
Investors Service Inc. and SP-Plus by Standard and Poor's
Corp., and the Fresno County notes are rated MIG-1 by
Moody's.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were off 1/8 on the bid
side at 98 1/2 to yield 7.32%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds

   West German government bonds declined again, prompting
fears among investors that yields on the benchmark 10year
government security could surpass 9%.
   Traders said investors worry that rising yields will soon
trigger a bond market selloff.
   "There's some selling now, but if yields climb over 9%,
the market expects outright sellers," said one trader at a
German bank in Dusseldorf.
   The price of Bonn's 8.75% issue due in 2000 closed
yesterday at 99.38, down 0.31 point, to yield 8.85%. Yields
on the shorter-term 8.5% notes due 1995 already top 9% and
ended yesterday at 9.01% after the price fell 0.07 point to
98.01.
   However, during after-market trading in the futures
market, prices of West German government bond futures rose
and ended slightly higher than Friday's after-market trading.
But the slight strength in the futures market didn't reverse
the general bearish feeling in the market.
   In addition to worries about interest rates, dealers said
also that investors continue to be nervous ahead of German
economic union July 1. West Germany's borrowing needs to
finance the restructuring of East Germany still rattles
investors, traders said. And weekend reports the Soviet Union
would accept a united Germany in NATO in exchange for
extensive economic aid didn't help sentiment.
   Other foreign bond markets ended lower yesterday for
various reasons. Japanese government bonds declined with the
value of the yen.
   British bonds ended lower on news that United Kingdom
retail sales grew at a relatively strong pace in May for the
second consecutive month.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-securities prices posted small losses, having
crept up from the opening lows in sparse dealings.
   Government National Mortgage Association pass-throughs for
June delivery were down 3/32 at 99 1/8, but had been off
about 7/32 in early dealings.
   Activity was centered in the primary market, where two
Federal National Mortgage Association real estate mortgage
investment conduit issues -- each for $300 million -- were
priced and a $600 million Marine Midland Bank credit-card
securities issue was priced.
   PaineWebber Inc. priced one of the Remic issues. It was
backed by Fannie Mae 9% pass-throughs. The other issue was
priced by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., and the securities were
backed by Fannie Mae 9.5% securities.
   The $600 million Marine Midland Bank offering backed by
credit-card loans was priced this afternoon by First Boston
Corp. The issue is expected to have a three-year average
life.
   The securities were priced in line with price talk -- 0.75
percentage point over the Treasury's three-year note. The new
securities were given an 8.95% coupon and priced at 99 30/32
for a 9.143% yield.
   Among actively traded secondary market issues, Ginnie Mae
10% securities for June delivery were off 2/32 at 101 17/32,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were down
1/8 at 98 1/2, Freddie Mac 10% securities were off 2/32 at
100 17/32, Fannie Mae 9.5% securities were 6/ 32 lower at 98
31/32 and Fannie Mae 10% securities were down 2/32 at 101
2/32.
