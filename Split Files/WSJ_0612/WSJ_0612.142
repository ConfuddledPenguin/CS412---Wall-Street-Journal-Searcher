counts of racketeering and mail fraud. Anthony Vulpis, 39,
was found guilty of seven racketeering and mail fraud counts.

   The case, in federal court in Manhattan, involved the
illegal dumping of 5,000 tons of garbage, including
infectious waste, in the city's Staten Island borough in
1988. The defendants were indicted last June on charges of
defrauding sanitation and transportation agencies of New York
City and New York state as well as several medical-care
facilities.
   Two other defendants, John McDonald of Demarest, N.J., and
New York Environmental Contractors, were each convicted of
one count of mail fraud. New York Environmental is owned by
Messrs. McDonald, Paccione and Vulpis.
   Messrs. Paccione and Vulpis and the six companies agreed
to pay a total of $22 million under the forfeiture provisions
of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
   Attorneys for the defendants said they plan to appeal.
Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 12 before federal Judge
Constance Baker Motley.
