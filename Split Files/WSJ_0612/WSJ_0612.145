   KELSO, Wash. -- Dan Norman believes in historical
accuracy.
   So he thinks a saloon girl, or variation thereof, should
grace one of several historical murals to be painted on
buildings in downtown Kelso, a city of 10,000 residents in
southwest Washington.

   His proposal to paint the town a tiny bit red, however,
has hit strong opposition.
   Mr. Norman, chairman of a downtown-revitalization
committee, suggested at a recent meeting that a lady of the
evening be part of a police-scene mural. The murals are
supposed to depict aspects of Kelso's 100-year history.
   Kelso acquired a racy reputation early this century, when
loggers from camps in surrounding river valleys came to Kelso
on weekends looking for a good time in its saloons and dance
halls.
   "That's what was really going on down there," Mr. Norman
says. "To ignore it is a little hypocritical." But he adds
that he has in mind "just . . . something along the lines of
Miss Kitty in `Gunsmoke.'"
   His proposal hasn't been put to a formal vote, but already
some committee members have responded with "a look like, `We
don't want to deal with it,'" he says.
   Committee members who oppose the suggestion say they want
to use Kelso's turn-of-the-century ambiance to attract
tourists and shoppers.
   "We do want to give the flavor of Kelso, but we don't
think {Mr. Norman's proposal} is the type of flavor we want
to promote," says committee member Lynn Woodard. Betty
Wilson, a former city councilwoman who attended the meeting,
says, "We've got a big future ahead of us, and I don't think
we need to put such insignificant, ordinary things up there."
   Darrell Frost, a Kelso city councilman who acts as liaison
to the committee, says Mr. Norman's idea might be appropriate
if it's done tastefully. "I think there would have to be a
sketch or design of what the final product would be before we
could consider it," he said.
   Committee member Vickie Jordan thinks the proposal is
amusing, but she has another concern -- one about the use of
federal grant money: "It's a cute thought, but I don't think
we want to go any further. This is taxpayers' money,
heavens]"
   But Mr. Norman isn't giving up. He plans to make a formal
motion on his proposition at the committee's next meeting
tomorrow. "We're not Disneyland. This isn't Mayberry, and I
don't think we should paint Aunt Bee on the wall."
