   Grossman's Inc. said second-quarter net income will be
"well below" the year-ago $10.6 million, or 40 cents a share.
   The Braintree, Mass., building-supplies retailer blamed
the decline on poor business conditions in the Northeast and
the expense of launching a new merchandising plan with name
brands, broader selection and lower prices. It said that
"customer reaction to the program has been heartening."

   The company also said its May sales on continuing
operations rose 4.1% to $78.5 million from $75.5 million in
May 1989. For the June quarter last year, Grossman's reported
sales of $343.9 million. Sales for the quarter from
continuing operations were $237.9 million.
   Grossman's sold its operations in the Northwest in the
year-ago third quarter.
