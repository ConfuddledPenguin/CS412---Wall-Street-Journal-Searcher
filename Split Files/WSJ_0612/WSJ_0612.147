   WASHINGTON -- President Bush and Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari said a comprehensive U.S.-Mexico
free-trade agreement is in the interest of both nations, and
they indicated they want formal negotiations to begin shortly
after their next meeting in December.
   Mr. Bush is scheduled to travel to Mexico for the December
meeting. Until then, White House Trade Representative Carla
Hills and Mexican Commerce Minister Jaime Serra Puche will
consult and do preparatory work for the trade negotiations.
Mr. Salinas said his government would send a formal request
letter to the U.S. later this year that would trigger
congressional consideration of legislation to facilitate the
talks.

   This timetable allows the Bush administration to pursue
its top trade priority, the successful completion of the
current Uruguay round of multilateral trade liberalization
talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those
talks are due to be completed in December.
   "We and the Mexicans anticipate that the Uruguay Round
will conclude first," the White House Trade Office said in a
statement. There has been concern that the U.S.-Mexico talks
might get in the way of the GATT talks.
   The two presidents, in a joint statement, said, "Free
trade between Mexico and the U.S. can be a powerful engine
for economic development, creating new jobs and opening new
markets." They also declared that such a pact should "help
forge a vigorous partnership for sustained economic growth
and opportunity." In 1989, commerce between the U.S. and
Mexico, the U.S.'s third largest trading partner, totaled $52
billion, with U.S. exports to Mexico totaling $25 billion.
   Meanwhile, Mexican Finance Minister Pedro Aspe -- who
accompanied Mr. Salinas on his visit here -- said some
foreign banks, including U.S. ones, are involved in
debt-trading operations through which some Mexicans are
alleged to have diverted funds and committed tax fraud. He
declined to name the banks, but said he is supplying that
information to the U.S. authorities. The allegations involve
possible misuse of Fideicomiso para la Cobertura de Riesgos
Cambiarios, or Ficorca, a government program through which
the foreign bank debts of Mexican private companies are
settled.
   As reported, the Mexican finance ministry last week
charged that two local businessmen had improperly diverted
Ficorca funds to shell companies in apparent attempts to
evade taxes and move the money out of the country. These
transactions involved foreign bank creditors, Mr. Aspe said,
but he declined to name them or elaborate on their role.
   The Federal Reserve now is looking into a number of
possible instances of irregularity and impropriety in the
handling and trading of developing country credits, including
those of Mexico, according to officials in the U.S. central
bank.
   During Mr. Salinas's two-day visit to the U.S., which ends
today, the Mexicans are emphasizing the potential benefits of
a free-trade pact. "We do envision an area of free trade
covering Mexico, the U.S. and Canada," Mr. Salinas said,
conjuring a vision of a united North American market that
might even be larger than the European Community.
   There is much support in the U.S. for a U.S.-Mexico
free-trade agreement. Last week, the Business Roundtable, a
group of about 200 top U.S. corporate leaders, urged both
countries to negotiate "a comprehensive bilateral trade and
investment agreement."
   But there also are some reservations. Some U.S. lawmakers
have expressed concern that such an agreement might adversely
affect groups such as U.S. labor and farmers. Bush
administration officials say such concerns can be addressed
during the period of informal dialogue between now and
December.
   Some more protected U.S. industries are particularly
fearful of the proposed pact. "We oppose a free-trade
agreement between Mexico and the U.S.," said Donald Hughes,
president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute.
"Such an agreement would further erode the market share of
domestic industry and result in further U.S. job losses,
which should be the first concern of our government," he
said.
   The Bush administration also has its concerns. Despite
Mexico's significant recent steps toward economic
liberalization, "the U.S. would like to see Mexico take
additional steps to: eliminate or reduce nontariff barriers
(particularly in agriculture), further liberalize its
investment regime and implement more extensive intellectual
property protection," the White House Trade Office said in a
statement released yesterday.
   U.S. and Mexican leaders are eager to keep Canada fully
informed about their talks. President Bush called Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney prior to the private dinner he
hosted for Mr. Salinas on Sunday to explain his talks with
Mr. Salinas about a trade pact. Both governments hope that
their trade agreement can be completed more quickly than a
similar pact negotiated between Canada and the U.S., which
took three years to negotiate.
   Mr. Salinas clearly hopes that a free-trade pact will open
his country to foreign investment. "Free trade is a signal
for stronger flow of investment into the country, as well as
capital reflow," he told reporters.
   Those funds are particularly important because Mexico is
embarking on the biggest process of privatization in its
history. Mr. Salinas estimated the effort may require
investment of between $20 billion and $25 billion. The
Mexican president pointed out that the recent announcement of
a plan to privatize his country's banks -- which were
nationalized in 1982 -- already had led to a 10 percentage
point drop in domestic interest rates.
