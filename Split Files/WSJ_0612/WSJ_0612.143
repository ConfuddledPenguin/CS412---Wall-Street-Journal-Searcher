   PASADENA, Calif. -- Parsons Corp. said a federal judge in
Los Angeles dismissed a lawsuit brought by 15 employees who
had challenged the leveraged buy-out of the engineering and
construction company by its employee stock ownership plan in
1985.
   The case has been closely watched by pension experts and
financial planners.

   The suit had charged that the ESOP's acquisition of
Parsons's shares was a breach of fiduciary responsibility,
misuse of corporate assets and a termination of predecessor
plans, all of which injured the participants in the
transaction.
   Specifically, the employees had charged that the company
executives who designed and implemented the buy-out pocketed
millions of dollars, while the employees' future retirement
funds became saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars of
debt.
   But, according to Parsons, U.S. Distrct Judge Robert
Kelleher found after a five-day trial that the ESOP
retirement committee had acted "both independently and
prudently in deciding that the buy-out was in the best
interests of the ESOP participants."
   An attorney for the plaintiffs said they would appeal. "I
respectfully believe the decision will be reversed," said
Frederick Furth, senior partner of Furth, Fahrner &amp; Mason in
San Francisco.
