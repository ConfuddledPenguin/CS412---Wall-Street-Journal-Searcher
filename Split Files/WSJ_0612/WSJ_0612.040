   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court struck down a federal law
against desecrating the U.S. flag, igniting a political
battle over an issue the Democrats had hoped to avoid.
   The law, declared unconstitutional on the same grounds the
court used to invalidate a Texas statute a year ago, sets up
a constitutional debate less than five months before the fall
elections. Bucking the polls, the president and the
Republican Party, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate
oppose any constitutional amendment on flag desecration.

   Even if they prevail legislatively, some Democrats may
lose in November because of how they vote on the issue.
Republicans hope the flag controversy will revive the party's
effort to paint the Democrats as out of step with mainstream
social and cultural views, an argument that has been badly
battered by public opposition to the Supreme Court's abortion
decision last July.
   "This is as clear a cultural-value issue as there can be,"
says Marc Nuttle, executive director of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaign
arm. "This is one of the value conflicts that allows us to
make a true comparison between parties and candidates. This
is a real opportunity."
   Those pushing the flag amendment currently have a slight
political edge in the battle to obtain the necessary
two-thirds of each house and then to submit it for approval
by three-quarters of the states.
   The two sides have already cast the issue as a struggle
over whether to protect the flag or to protect the Bill of
Rights. Democrats find themseves on the defensive, with the
Republicans even holding an advantage in stating the issue.
House GOP leader Robert Michel of Illinois strode onto the
floor yesterday and declared that "the essential question is:
Does the Congress really want to protect the flag from
desecration?"
   The Democratic leadership's position is more complicated.
It is preparing to argue that the flag proposal would for the
first time amend the 200-year-old protections of the Bill of
Rights.
   Democrats who watched Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts struggle with a similar position in the 1988
presidential election know how difficult the fight will be.
"Opposition to the amendment may be noble, but it may take a
miracle to stop it," says Harvard Law School professor
Christopher Edley, who was the issues director for the
Dukakis campaign. "I know the power of this issue -- and the
dangers of a position that takes a long explanation to the
public."
   Opponents of a constitutional amendment have already tried
a quick-fix solution. After the Supreme Court voided the
Texas law, Congress quickly passed the law struck down
yesterday. The law was passed in part to head off any
amendment.
   In its 5-4 vote, the court found that the federal law,
like the Texas statute, violated the First Amendment's
guarantee of freedom of speech.
   A 20-word proposed constitutional amendment, already
introduced in the House and Senate, says Congress and the
states have the power to pass laws to "prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag." The effect would be that the First
Amendment would no longer protect actions involving the flag
from state or federal prosecution.
   Republican strategists say they are geared up to exploit
what Wendy DeMocker, spokeswoman for the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee, calls a "very powerful, very
potent, very emotional issue." The five Democratic senators
the Republicans consider most vulnerable this fall -- Max
Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Carl Levin of
Michigan, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and Paul Simon of
Illinois -- all voted against an effort for an amendment
after the decision in the Texas case.
   One Republican mulling use of the issue is Mr. Simon's
opponent, Rep. Lynn Martin. "On a system of values that
matter, here is one of the places we differ," she says. "I
won't call him names, but I think he is out of touch."
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic political consultant, says the
best response Democratic candidates can make to such charges
is "to say they love the country and the flag. People know no
politician is for burning the flag."
   Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, who won the
Congressional Medal of Honor in Vietnam, cast the issue in
terms of the changes sweeping the former Communist bloc: "I
don't see how we can make repeated trips to Eastern Europe,
talking about freedom and the right to dissent . . . and not
once saying that when you put together your constitution,
make sure you protect your flag."
   Some Republicans argue against embracing the flag
campaign. "This is truly the vilest of cheap issues," says
John Buckley, a GOP political consultant. "Democrats who get
on the wrong side of this may face political oblivion, but
Republicans who exploit it ought to face intellectual hell."
   Adds conservative Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire: "The Bill of Rights is a list of things that the
government may not do, and one of those is to limit speech. I
don't want it diluted for any purpose."
   President Bush indicated his determination to "continue to
press for what I strongly believe is in the public interest"
-- a constitutional amendment.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole even urged a floor vote
Thursday, Flag Day. In political terms, Mr. Dole said, the
issue would "make a good 30-second spot." Asked whether a
lawmaker could easily defend opposition to the amendment, he
said: "I think he could at a bar association meeting, but not
before real people."
   Democratic Rep. Robert Kastenmeier of Wisconsin, a member
of the House Judiciary Committee and an opponent of the
amendment, says, "I don't think at the moment that there is
one-third-plus-one members of the House to defeat the
amendment."
   In striking down the federal law, the Supreme Court
divided as it did in the Texas case. Justice William Brennan
wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Thurgood
Marshall, Harry Blackmun, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy.
Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and Sandra
O'Connor.
   Many constitutional-law experts had expected the outcome.
"Congress had made clear that the law was not designed to
protect the (physical) integrity of the flag, but rather to
suppress unpatriotic treatment of the flag," said Harvard Law
School Prof. Laurence Tribe. The eight-page decision --
issued less than a month after the case was argued -- and the
six-page dissent contained none of the emotional rhetoric
that marked the Texas-case ruling.
   The House Judiciary Committee will consider the amendment
next Tuesday, with a vote on the floor coming as soon as a
week later. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden
(D., Del.), who has said he plans to draft his own
constitutional amendment, is embarking on a slower schedule
that will include hearings "to determine how to best fashion
an amendment that doesn't do violence" to the Bill of Rights.
Senate leaders haven't agreed on a timetable for floor
action.
   The Democratic leaders are committed to allowing a vote on
an amendment despite their own opposition; they believe it
would be even more damaging to avoid the issue.
   Some strategists argue that the political risk of the
issue is overstated. "I can't imagine that it will make a
critical difference in elections," says Harrison Hickman, a
Democratic pollster and consultant. "The public has chewed
this around pretty good. It might stimulate some voter
turnout, but I don't think you'll see people charging out to
oust an incumbent just because of this."
   Lawmakers already had a chance to show their support for
the flag by voting on a resolution to condemn the Supreme
Court's original flag-burning decision and by voting for the
statute that the court struck down yesterday. The two earlier
votes may provide some Democrats with enough political cover
to support the leadership on the amendment.
   Democratic Rep. Don Edwards of California, one of the most
ardent opponents of the amendment, says political risk
remains. "If that risk weren't there," he says, "the
membership would overwhelmingly vote to preserve the
Constitution."
