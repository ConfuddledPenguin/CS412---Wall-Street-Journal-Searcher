   SEOUL, South Korea -- Ford Motor Co. was selling about 250
American-made Mercury Sables a month in Korea through its
10%-owned Korean affiliate, Kia Motor Co. It wasn't many
cars, but Ford was pleased to be outselling all the West
German makers combined while laying a foundation for future
sales.
   Kia, a compact-car company, also seemed pleased to have
the popular large car in its lineup. But recently, Kia cut
its advertising for the Sables and then its orders from Ford.

   Why? Because, Kia says, the Korean government told it to.
Government leaders thought Korea was importing too many
foreign cars -- even though Korea, which exported about
350,000 cars last year, agreed three years ago to open its
domestic automobile market to imports. "We tell the companies
that they have to understand the sensitivities of the people
and for the good of the country restrain their sales of
luxury goods," says an official at the Ministry of Trade and
Industry.
   Late last month, the government announced that anyone
buying a new car must purchase an increased amount of subway
bonds. But the increase for buyers of imports is much larger.
For instance, a Mercedes buyer now must purchase bonds worth
about 14 million won ($20,000), up from three million, while
the requirement for a domestic luxury car rose only about 50%
to 5.9 million won.
   With regard to many other products as well, Korea has
promised repeatedly to open its markets to imports and to
protect the intellectual-property rights of foreign
companies. And the U.S. has taken the Korean government's
word. But lately, foreign executives and trade officials see
mounting evidence that the government, despite its denials,
is backtracking on moves to open markets -- to the dismay of
West Europeans as well as Americans.
   "There is liberalization," says Gilles Anouil, the
ambassador to Korea for the Commission of the European
Communities. "But when they open a door, sometimes they close
another." European ambassadors and U.S. officials have been
complaining to Seoul. "We are concerned because of the
pattern of activity," says Peter G. Frederick, counselor for
commercial affairs at the U.S. Embassy.
   The Ford case is but one example of bureaucratic
obstruction and the new campaign against foreign goods:
   -- The Korea Trade Commission, loosely modeled on the U.S.
International Trade Commission, announced it will investigate
whether 200 imported products, such as pens, cookies, steel
plates and various consumer products, are damaging the
domestic market -- even though the domestic industries aren't
complaining. The U.S. protested to the Korean government, but
Kim Won Soon, the commission chairman, says he is "proud of
what we are doing."
   -- Kukje Corp., a major Korean sporting-goods producer,
started making tennis shoes carrying the Batman logo created
by D.C. Comics, a division of Time Warner Inc. When U.S.
lawyers asked the Korean patent office to help protect the
trademark, the officials sided with the Korean company even
though a 1986 U.S.-Korea trade agreement specifically says
world-famous trademarks are to be protected. "I never heard
of Batman," the Korean official allegedly said. Tough legal
action eventually forced Kukje to back off.
   -- Cargill Corp., the giant American commodities trader,
wants to build a $30 million soybean-crushing mill in Korea
to service the local feed and soybean-oil markets. Despite
the government's statements that it now encourages foreign
investment, Cargill can't get approval for the plant -- not a
"yes," not a "no," just silence.
   The list goes on and on: Cracker Jack-type candy is
banned; high taxes and tariffs make Scotch in Korea the most
expensive in the industrialized world ($47 for a fifth of
Johnny Walker Red Label); U.S. cigarette marketers are
harassed and unable to sell their products; Citibank can't
open branches in Korea as promised.
   "It's guerrilla warfare," says Mr. Frederick at the U.S.
Embassy. "It's a constant house-to-house battle." Concludes
an American Chamber of Commerce report: "It has become
increasingly clear that, at times, liberalization in Korea
can mean absolutely nothing."
   So, why did the U.S. recently bypass Korea when it
prepared its list of unfair traders? According to State and
Commerce department officials involved in the issues, U.S.
officials knew about some of the problems. But the consensus
in the U.S. government was that it might be counterproductive
to push Korea too hard. "We are still trying to get them to
implement prior agreements, and taking on any more changes
might overload the {Korean} system," says a State Department
official in Washington.
   Similarly, many foreign executives believe that publicly
complaining about Korean tactics damages any chance of
getting cooperation. So, Ford won't talk about its problem.
Neither will Citibank nor the American tobacco companies.
   "It is not in our interest to foment problems between the
U.S. and Korean governments," says Robert J. Gregory of the
American Chamber, one of the few U.S. executives willing to
talk on the record, and then only as the organization's
president rather than as a CalTex executive.
   In addition, some observers play down the problem. "There
have been a few bumps in the road," says U.S. Ambassador
Donald Gregg, but he says otherwise he is "very pleased" with
the trade picture. "The message I give Koreans is we are
doing fine, but we need to do more."
   Korean officials note the nation's trade surplus with the
U.S. is shrinking rapidly, from $8 billion in 1988 to $4.5
billion in 1989. They add that this year Korea could have a
small trade deficit with the U.S. and a $2 billion to $3
billion deficit overall. But its surplus in U.S. trade is
dropping not because its markets are open but because its
exports have slumped. Less than 2.4% of Korea's imports from
the U.S. are consumer goods, according to a U.S. government
report.
   Park Pil Soo, Korea's trade and industry minister,
pooh-poohs the notion that the government is reverting to
protectionism. "Once you open your market, you cannot close
it," he says. For Korea to export, it must import, he says.
"Except luxury goods," he adds.
   The catch, for the U.S. and Europe, is that Korea
considers almost every imported finished product a luxury
good. Many products that the Western economies make are aimed
at the upscale market -- golf clubs, whiskey, big cars --
because that is where Western countries have the comparative
advantage. And that is what they export.
   The Korean government is discouraging the consumption of
luxury goods because it considers that unhealthy for the
Korean economy. So, it is ordering tax investigations of
people who buy imported cars or sell imported clothes. The
government is encouraging department stores to close
boutiques offering foreign clothes and accessories. It is
tightening the exhaust tests for the 325 or so foreign cars
that trickle in each month. It even bans foreigners from
acting in commercials for fear that they will whip up the
desire for foreign goods.
   Tupperware plastic kitchenware is listed among the luxury
goods, Ambassador Anouil notes. "If you call it luxurious,
you can call anything luxurious, even a General Motors car,"
he says. "This campaign is taking proportions that is
worrisome." The American Chamber of Commerce agrees:
"Criticisms of excessive consumption of imported products
serves no purpose other than to increase the anti-foreign
bias of the Korean market."
   The recent anti-foreign-goods crusade is especially
disturbing because it contradicts the open-markets policy
message supposedly coming from the top of the Korean
government. Faced with delays and obstructions, foreign
executives, lawyers and trade officials had always assumed
that the Western-educated technocrats high up in powerful
bureaucracies sincerely believe in open markets and blamed
any problems on low-level people prone to do things the old
way. "It is very hard to undo 30 years of training," says Mr.
Gregory of the American Chamber.
   Now, the low-level officials look up and see that the
traditional obstructionist methods are in favor -- and in
abundance.
   Many of the government's trade agreements haven't been
implemented. Foreign banks, for instance, would like to open
branches in Korea and, like Korean banks, tie into
automatic-teller-machine networks. But foreigners'
applications are languishing. Although a new Korean bank,
Donghwa Bank, applied last summer for permission to join the
ATM network and received approval within two weeks,
Citibank's application was, by then, already moldering for a
year, and the American bank is still waiting.
   "Do we see a more positive attitude toward U.S. banks?
Absolutely not," says Richard Mounce, a Chase Manhattan
executive who heads the Foreign Bankers Association. "We've
seen numerous instances that policy directions are agreed on
a senior level and there is a great deal of difficulty
getting it through."
   Another irritant is the Korean government's reluctance to
enforce the protection of trademarks, copyrights and patents
-- intellectual property rights. Korea signed an agreement
with the U.S. in 1986, but process patents, particularly with
pharmaceuticals, are violated regularly, U.S. drug companies
say. Trade secrets aren't protected, under Korean law, if the
government thinks they are unfair. There is no semiconductor
chip design-protection law. The market for computer software
and videos is awash in pirated copies because of the lack of
enforcement, according to officials of Microsoft Corp. and
several American movie companies.
   Although the Korean government cracked down a bit last
year in its successful effort to get the U.S. to take it off
the list of unfair traders, counterfeit goods still pour out
of Korean factories. Some examples, such as the Batman case,
are blatant. The government says it supported the U.S.
company's plea, but it still allows Korean makers to use
famous characters, such as Snoopy, Mickey Mouse, RoboCop and
Woody Woodpecker without authorization of the trademark
owner.
   The government makes occasional raids on the stalls in the
Itaewon tourist shopping district, where fake Rolex watches,
Gucci bags and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle T-shirts are sold
openly. But counterfeits flow unabated out of the country.
   In August and September of 1989, investigators in the U.S.
and Mexico seized several shipments of counterfeit Reebok,
Vans and Converse sports shoes -- several hundred thousand
pairs. Federal authorities filed criminal charges at El Paso,
Texas, and Tucson, Ariz., against several importers. Reebok
also filed civil suits against the importers in federal court
in San Diego. With that end of the pipeline closing, Reebok's
attorneys set out to dam up the source: Korea.
   They sent almost a thousand pages of evidence to Korean
authorities, much of it translated into Korean. The evidence
included shipping documents, invoices, copies of checks and
money orders, specification sheets, even letters and
facsimiles sent between the exporter in Korea and the
importers in the U.S.
   One document, an attachment to an affidavit filed by
Harley I. Lewin, a New York attorney representing Reebok,
showed that a U.S. importer paid more than $1 million to the
Korean supplier. Another document, a photocopy of a letter
allegedly from a Korean company to U.S. importers, says the
importers should send payments in amounts of $50,000 to evade
Korea's export-licensing rules -- "otherwise we have big
problem for export of your order." The attorneys also sent
along names, addresses, bank-account numbers, even phone
numbers. Many of the offices are still taking phone calls at
the listed numbers.
   "If there ever was a case that we made it easy for the
Koreans, this is it," Mr. Lewin says. "We gave it to them
giftwrapped."
   But nothing happened. The U.S. government complained in
private talks with the Korean trade minister, his staff and
other officials. Still nothing is happening. Kim Chul Su, who
heads the Korean Industrial Property Office that enforces
intellectual property rights, says, "The information provided
by the Reebok case was so scanty that prosecutors were unable
to apprehend the persons in question."
