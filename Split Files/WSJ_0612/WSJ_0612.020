   LUXEMBOURG -- European Community finance ministers agreed
to remove several tax barriers facing companies operating on
a multinational basis in the EC.
   Three measures are aimed at removing the risk of double
taxation for groups of affiliated companies operating in
several EC states and for companies acquiring a firm in
another EC member state.

   At a time when the EC is striving for greater economic
convergence, yesterday's compromise signals that the
community is finally starting to tackle the delicate task of
achieving more coherence in corporate taxation. Christiane
Scrivener, the EC Commissioner in charge of fiscal affairs,
described the accord as "a milestone" in the EC's program to
remove all internal barriers by the end of 1992.
   In recent months, European and U.S. companies operating in
the EC had been lobbying hard for adoption of the three
measures, which have been under consideration by the EC for
almost 20 years.
   The three measures, which will take effect Jan. 1, 1992,
are:
   -- A first directive will eliminate capital-gains taxes
when assets are transferred between companies based in
different EC member states in the event of a merger,
corporate split-up, or share swap. Taxation will be deferred
until the assets are realized, that is, sold or transferred
to a non-EC company. The aim is to "eliminate the fiscal cost
of cross-border operations," Mrs. Scrivener said.
   -- A second directive will abolish the withholding taxes
on dividends paid by a subsidiary to its parent company based
in another EC country. West Germany had strongly opposed this
measure. With high taxes on retained profits, Bonn worried
that this would give too big a tax break to subsidiaries of
foreign companies transferring their profits back home. As a
compensatory gesture, Bonn may, until mid-1996, levy a 5%
withholding tax on those dividends.
   -- A third measure sets up an "arbitration procedure" to
resolve conflicts between tax authorities in different member
states, which often result in a company being taxed in two
countries on the same operation. When such difficulties
arise, the companies will be able to ask for the arbitration
by a "panel of wise men," which is still to be set up. The
panel's decision will be binding for the member states. "This
strengthens the hand of taxpayers" in the face of tax
authorities, said a British official.
   Meanwhile, the finance ministers narrowed their
differences over a proposed "investment-services directive"
aimed at establishing a single license for brokerage and
other non-bank financial services firms in the EC. Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC commissioner for financial services, said the
12 member states vowed to reach an accord on the directive by
Dec. 31.
   Among other things, the investment services directive
provides that banks will have direct access to trade on stock
markets.
   Belgium, Spain and Denmark indicated that they were ready
to drop their opposition to that measure, Sir Leon said.
