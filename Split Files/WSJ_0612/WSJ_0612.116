   Birmingham Steel Corp., Birmingham, Ala., said it has an
option to buy 1,000 acres of land just west of Phoenix,
Ariz., as a likely site for a new steel minimill.
   The new mill, which would produce 500,000 tons of steel
annually, could begin production before the end of 1992, the
company said.

   A new minimill, which would use an electric furnace to
produce steel from scrap, would cost more than $100 million,
Birmingham said. The new mill would employ about 250 people.
   The facility would replace a mill at Emeryville, Calif.,
which the company must close before the end of 1997, under an
agreement with local officials, Birmingham said. High
transportation, electric power and labor costs at Emeryville
led the company to start seeking a new site well before the
deadline.
   Birmingham produces reinforcing bars, steel roof-support
systems for underground coal mines and other steel products.
   The company said it will continue to evaluate several
other possible locations for the mill, but that it has begun
seeking environmental and operating approvals for the Arizona
site.
