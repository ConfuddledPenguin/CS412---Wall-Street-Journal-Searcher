   FORT WORTH, Texas -- A federal bankruptcy court approved
the liquidation plan proposed by Texas American Bancshares
Inc., to become effective July 16 barring any creditors'
appeals.
   Texas American, whose 24 bank subsidiaries were seized by
federal regulators last summer, is the first major Texas bank
holding company to have a bankruptcy plan confirmed by the
courts.

   The confirmation order fixes June 12 as the date of
ownership of Texas American's notes and debentures for the
purpose of making distributions. Although creditors have
until June 17 to appeal the plan, a bank spokesman said no
appeals are anticipated. Bank stockholders will not receive a
distribution under the plan.
   A Texas American spokesman said the company has about $46
million in cash and between $105 million and $108 million in
outstanding claims, but that the initial distribution will be
limited to about $17 million, pending resolution of disputed
claims.
   All of Texas American's remaining assets, consisting
primarily of real estate, gas and oil leases, and employee
loans, will be held in liquidating trusts once the plan
becomes effective. Matthew Metcalfe of Mobile, Ala., will
continue as liquidating trustee.
