   When Peter Diamandis sold his company to Paris-based
Hachette S.A., the deal made the magazine publisher a
millionaire many times over. But he stayed on with the new
owners to pursue his passion: acquiring and creating new
magazines.
   Two years later, that passion looks unsated. New magazines
have been few and far between, while Hachette is faced with
burdensome debt from the $712 million it paid for Diamandis
Communications Inc., the country's largest publisher of
special interest magazines.

   Mr. Diamandis, who retained his title of president and
chief executive of Diamandis, is even assuming the
uncomfortable mantle of becoming a buyer turned seller: Last
month, under pressure from Hachette, Diamandis Communications
put Woman's Day -- one of the largest magazines in the U.S.
-- up for sale.
   "Emotionally, I'm not happy about selling Woman's Day,"
Mr. Diamandis said in an interview. "The editor and publisher
are my friends, and I was once its publisher. What's more, I
see myself as a builder and promoter, not a seller."
   With signs of some strain between Mr. Diamandis and
Hachette, there is speculation that he may not renew at year
end his contract with Hachette Publications Inc., the U.S.
subsidiary. Although the 58-year-old Mr. Diamandis says he
expects to renew his contract at some point, he adds there
are hitches to work out. "Money isn't the issue," he says.
"It has to do with authority. I am more concerned with the
growth of the company."
   Industry executives say Hachette has been less than
enthusiastic about Memories, the nostalgia magazine Mr.
Diamandis started as a pet project in 1989. The executives
say that if Hachette doesn't give more promotional support to
Memories, Mr. Diamandis may consider buying the magazine in
partnership with its editor and publisher, and possibly start
a new Diamandis company. (Mr. Diamandis says any speculation
about Memories has been caused by interested buyers for the
magazine who have approached Hachette, adding that Memories
isn't for sale.)
   Losing Mr. Diamandis would be a blow to Hachette, which
has relied on the 25-year publishing veteran to establish its
first big stake in U.S. magazine publishing. "Peter is a
great motivator of people, and that's key in publishing,"
says Dan McNamee, an industry consultant. "If he left, it
would be perceived as a disaster."
   Mr. Diamandis is a respected industry executive. In 1982,
he was hired by CBS Inc. to turn around its then ailing and
dowdy Woman's Day. Five years later, he led senior management
of the CBS consumer magazines unit in a leveraged buy-out,
forming Diamandis Communications. When Mr. Diamandis sold the
company to Hachette in 1988, making for himself about $20
million, he also spread the wealth through stock options and
bonuses among the company's top 100 executives. Diamandis
executives will receive the final 10% of their payout Dec.
31, and there is speculation that should Mr. Diamandis leave,
he could take with him a loyal, well-compensated echelon of
top executives.
   Even without Woman's Day and its 21 special one-shot
editions, Diamandis will remain one of the largest U.S.
magazine publishers, with 17 special-interest magazines
generating more than $450 million in revenue. Many of its
titles -- Car &amp; Driver, Road &amp; Track, Stereo Review, Popular
Photography, and Audio -- are high quality consumer
magazines.
   But expansion hasn't gone as expected. In the past year,
Hachette has lost out in bids to buy McCall's and the
National Enquirer. Since acquiring Diamandis, Hachette bought
the 50% it didn't already own of the U.S. version of French
fashion magazine Elle. But as for the cloning of U.S. and
French magazines such as Elle in both countries, the
ambitious plan has fallen short -- something Mr. Diamandis
attributes to "the economic malaise in the world." After two
years, almost no French magazine ideas have proven right for
U.S. introduction. Plans to launch foreign-language clones of
Memories and Stereo Review, haven't materialized.
   That isn't to say nothing has been added. In the past two
years, Diamandis has turned out some new niche publications,
such as Boat magazine, and Sound &amp; Image, a spinoff from
Stereo Review. Recently, Hachette launched editions of Car &amp;
Driver for Hong Kong and Greece. And Diamandis gave a new
format to American Photo (formerly American Photographer)
along the lines of Photo, an oversized French photography
magazine published by a Hachette sister company.
   Hachette's Elle magazine has been successfully duplicated
in 17 countries, from Holland to China. In the U.S., Hachette
recently launched Elle Decor, a home and architecture
magazine.
   But Elle itself, which grew astronomically after its U.S.
launch in 1985, has come back to Earth. Facing revitalized or
new competitors such as Conde Nast's Vogue, Hearst Corp.'s
Harper's Bazaar, and News Corp.'s one-year-old Mirabella,
combined with turmoil among national retailers, its ad pages
are dropping. In the first quarter of 1990, Elle's total ad
pages fell 12% from 1989. The soft advertising market has
hurt some other usually robust Diamandis magazines as well.
   As wrenching as the sale of Woman's Day would be, Mr.
Diamandis concedes: "It's probably intelligent. Taking down
the debt is important, and Woman's Day is totally different
from our other magazines."
   But the sale may not go as smoothly as Hachette expects.
Didier Guerin, president of Hachette Publications, says the
magazine will sell for at least $200 million, about eight
times 1989 operating cash flow. Some observers say that's too
optimistic. "In today's market, where multiples have sunk to
six to seven times cash flow, and given Woman's Day's
operating performance, $200 million may not be reasonable,"
says Mr. McNamee, the consultant.
   Mr. Diamandis says Woman's Day had an operating profit of
$27 million in 1988 and $25 million in 1989. But in the sales
prospectus, Hachette estimates Woman's Day operating profit
will fall to $15.9 million this year. For the first quarter
of 1990, Woman's Day ad pages fell 22% from last year, the
largest decline of any of the women's service magazines.
   Prospective buyers, running the publishing gamut from
Reader's Digest Association to Time Warner Inc., were
screened last week and a winner could be named by mid-July.
Most bidders have no comment; those that do temper their
enthusiasm. Cahners Publishing Co., a subsidiary of
London-based Reed International PLC, says, "Our level of
interest has been overstated in the media consistently."
   Hachette's Mr. Guerin says once the Woman's Day sale is
complete, there will be no need to sell off any more
magazines. The company's goal, he says, will be to
concentrate on special-interest magazines in the U.S. and
magazines with international appeal, such as Elle.
   Mr. Diamandis envisions the company becoming an aggressive
acquirer once again, with an eye on start-ups, possibly
focused on golf, travel and maybe skiing. "It's my hope we
won't sell any more and will buy and start magazines very
shortly," he says.
