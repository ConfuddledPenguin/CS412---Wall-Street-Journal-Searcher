   Suzanne de Passe was a brash newcomer to the entertainment
business when she was hired by the legendary Berry Gordy of
Motown Records in 1968.
   Today, as the 44-year-old president of Motown Productions,
a top movie and television producer, she deals with the
biggest names in Hollywood. But one person she can't quite
deal with is Mr. Gordy, who is still her boss.

   Their relationship has at once engendered "pride and
resentment" of each other, Ms. de Passe recently told a
gathering of women executives in Beverly Hills, Calif. "It's
very dicey stuff," she said, in a speech punctuated with
tears. Despite her own success, she confessed, "I still feel
like the little girl that Berry Gordy wants me to be."
   As any pupil who has brought the teacher an apple can
testify, the mentoring process is filled with emotion. But in
the business world, where mentor-protege relationships often
prove decisive in determining who climbs to the top of the
corporate ladder, they can be fitfully complex. And when
inevitable frictions go unresolved, they can have dire
consequences, undermining a company's strategy or forcing
valuable executives to leave.
   "When these relationships work, they're fabulous," says
Marilyn Puder-York, a New York psychologist who has counseled
executives over mentoring gone awry. "But when they don't
work, they can be terribly destructive. There's a lot of pain
and trauma involved."
   Under normal circumstances, mentoring -- the process in
which older executives befriend younger ones, guiding them
and typically advancing their careers -- can be a positive
force. Done constructively, it's beneficial for the mentor,
protege and, above all, the organization. It builds trust and
loyalty and makes for better-informed decision making. A few
companies, in fact, have formal mentoring programs.
   "I have a strong desire to see people succeed in this
organization," says Timothy Schieffelin, a vice president at
Citicorp who has been a volunteer mentor since the bank began
a program two years ago. "If we can help newcomers avoid
pitfalls, then we all benefit." Mr. Schieffelin has coached
one "mentoree" (as Citicorp calls them) on how to ask his
boss for more responsibility and helped another to find a new
job in the bank.
   Though mentoring is widespread, some executives tend to
play it down, partly because it suggests favoritism and so
may undermine morale. "Generally, (mentor relationships) are
a negative force," says Donald Trautlein, retired chief
executive of Bethlehem Steel Corp. "At least I tried to avoid
them." But former colleagues say Mr. Trautlein advanced the
career of at least one midlevel accountant, who's now a
senior executive at Bethlehem.
   Effective mentors understand their role and accept it.
"Think of a good parent," says Ms. Puder-York, the
psychologist. "When the child grows up, he or she says,
`That's great.' They're pleased to see them succeed and move
on, because that's what they've been training them for." In
the same way, she adds, "The wise mentor recognizes that
change is inevitable, and is gratified, not threatened, by
it."
   Often, though, it's not that clear-cut. Kathy Kram, a
business professor at Boston University who has written
extensively on mentoring, has studied more than 100
mentor-protege pairs in corporate settings. Executives tend
to manifest a desire to mentor in mid- or late-career, once
their own ambitions have been largely realized. Invariably,
she says, these relationships buckle -- and sometimes break
-- as the protege ascends and the mentor recedes. "There's a
tension there that often produces a lot of conflict and
sometimes destructive dynamics," she says.
   At Motown, Ms. de Passe feels Mr. Gordy's presence cramped
her artistic latitude. "I want freedom to not have to edit or
worry about his reactions," she told the women's group. "You
become the mentor of one's mentor." Mr. Gordy couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Problems can arise in part because the motives behind
mentoring aren't always altruistic. The protege may seek the
relationship solely to advance his or her career. The mentor
may be motivated by a need for power or control, rather than
feelings of loyalty or affiliation. Hence, the mentor may
feel threatened by the protege's rise.
   Consider the case of Robert Brudno, who heads the
Washington, D.C., office of executive recruiter Leon A.
Farley Associates. As a young consultant working for Booz
Allen &amp; Hamilton in the mid-1970s, Mr. Brudno caught the eye
of a client, the owner of a medium-sized family-controlled
concern. The owner, looking for a successor, hired Mr. Brudno
as president.
   For the first few years, Mr. Brudno and the founder, who
remained chairman, had a constructive mentor-protege
relationship. But as the chairman neared retirement, he
became increasingly unwilling to relinquish control. At first
the signs were subtle: He would demand changes in programs
championed by Mr. Brudno after having already given his
approval. Or he would create problems and spring them on Mr.
Brudno in staff meetings.
   Then, one day, the owner summoned Mr. Brudno to his office
and told him that his son -- who formerly hadn't been
involved at all in the business -- would instead be the
successor. "I remember the moment vividly because I walked 30
feet to my office, sat down and immediately wrote out my
resume," Mr. Brudno recalls. Soon after, he quit the company,
which two years later filed for bankruptcy.
   "Mentorship does require that the mentor be secure," Mr.
Brudno says. "It takes a big man or woman to depart
gracefully."
   Because the mentoring process can create a sense of
obligation, departing can also be hard for the protege. Rene
McPherson, the former dean of Stanford University's business
school, recalls the difficulty he had summoning up the
courage to tell his mentor, Dana Corp. Chairman Jack Martin,
that he didn't plan to serve as Dana chief executive past age
55. Mr. McPherson wanted to quit business for other pursuits
but feared his boss wouldn't understand his rationale. "I
knew he was going to be furious, and I didn't want to tell
him, but I had to," he says. Mr. Martin eventually accepted
the decision.
   Sometimes the emotional tensions prove too great. One
woman, a lawyer in her mid-30s who was the protege of a male
partner at a New York law firm, got caught in the cross fire
of a disintegrating marital relationship. Eventually, as the
partner's marriage soured, he began to lean on her for
support. But she resisted, only able to see him as the father
she'd never had.
   The woman, who asked not to be named, ended up quitting
the firm to escape. But after seeking counseling, she
re-established a relationship with her former mentor, though
as friends on an equal footing. "She was coached on how to
communicate with him," says her therapist.
