   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it will get out of
the acrylic fiber business after 40 years of supplying the
fiber to makers of sweaters, socks and other products.
   Du Pont, which sold the fiber under the Orlon trade name,
said it had been losing money on the business in recent years
because of imports and the loss of customers to polyester and
cotton. "Each market, for its own set of reasons, has been
under attack," said Paul G. Gillease, director of Du Pont's
textile division.

   He said annual sales of Orlon were about $200 million. In
1989, total fiber sales by Du Pont, including those of nylon,
were $5.97 billion.
   Mr. Gillease said Du Pont will withdraw from the acrylic
fiber business as soon as possible to concentrate on its
other apparel fabrics, Dacron polyester and Lycra spandex. He
said the company will probably be able to offer other jobs to
a majority of the 775 people currently employed in the Orlon
business. Du Pont makes Orlon along with other fabrics at
plants in Camden, S.C., and Waynesboro, Va.
   The exit by Du Pont should give a boost to other acrylic
fiber makers, who have been operating amid excess production
capacity. Monsanto Co., which counts itself the largest U.S.
producer, said there is more than enough domestic capacity to
absorb the closing of Du Pont's production lines.
