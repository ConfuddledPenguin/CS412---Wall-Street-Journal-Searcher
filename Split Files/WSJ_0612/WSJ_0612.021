   WASHINGTON -- U.S. manufacturers' after-tax profits fell
to an average 4.2% of sales in the first quarter from 4.4% in
the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported.
   The slip marks further deterioration in profits, which a
year earlier were at 5.7% of sales, according to the
department.

   Despite the softness, profits picked up in the durable
goods industries, which have shown widespread weakness in
recent quarters. Profits on durable goods -- products such as
machinery, metals and home appliances expected to last more
than three years -- totaled $11.67 billion in the first
quarter. That was higher than the $8.82 billion in the fourth
quarter but still significantly below the $15.94 billion
posted for the first quarter of 1989.
   Profits on nondurable goods fell to $16.24 billion in the
first quarter from $19.82 billion in the fourth quarter and
$21.91 billion a year earlier. Nondurable goods are items
such as petroleum products, chemicals and food that have a
usefulness of less than three years.
   The annual rate of return on shareholders' equity fell to
10.9% in the first quarter from 11.3% the preceding quarter
and 15.3% a year earlier.
