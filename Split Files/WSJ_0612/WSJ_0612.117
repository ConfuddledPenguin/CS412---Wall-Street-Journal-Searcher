   Ultimate Corp., East Hanover, N.J., bought from Midlantic
National Bank, 575,000 Ultimate shares, which the bank had
received as part of a personal bankruptcy-law settlement made
by former Ultimate Chairman Theodore Sabarese.
   Ultimate paid $6.50 a share, or $3.7 million, for the
block, leaving the computer-systems concern with 8.9 million
shares outstanding.

   Last June, Mr. Sabarese resigned as Ultimate's chairman
and made a personal filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Newark, N.J. In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission
filing, he disclosed the settlement with the bank and said
that he might bid to take over Ultimate. He couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Midlantic is a subsidiary of Midlantic Corp., Edison, N.J.
