   A task force of state attorneys general is expected to
file legal action against Mobil Chemical Co. for making
allegedly false advertising claims concerning environmental
benefits of its Hefty garbage-bag line, people close to the
situation say.
   Those people say lawsuits planned in seven states could be
filed as early as today and would represent the first
enforcement action since the task force began investigating
environmental product claims last November.

   The attorneys general, led by Hubert H. Humphrey III of
Minnesota, are taking action against Mobil Chemical because
Hefty products on store shelves in some states continue to
claim they are "degradable," "even after they are buried in a
landfill," those people say. They also say the actions could
seek removal of the products from store shelves and payment
of legal costs.
   Barry J. Cutler, Federal Trade Commission director of
consumer protection, confirmed the states planned to take
legal action, but wouldn't identify the company. In general,
he said, such lawsuits could produce guidelines defining when
other companies could legally use the term "degradable."
   Hefty trash bags contain an additive that accelerates
decomposition of the plastic when it is exposed to sunlight,
wind and rain. Critics complain that these conditions are not
a factor once the trash is buried in landfills.
   Allen Gray, spokesman for Mobil Chemical, a unit of New
York-based Mobil Corp., said the company hasn't been notified
of any pending legal action. He said Mobil agreed in late
March to remove degradability claims and began changing
labels in April because of "mounting confusion" over the
meaning and value of such claims. "This is news to us. We're
disappointed," Mr. Gray said, adding that Mobil had
cooperated with the investigation and "substantiated" its
product claims.
   The states are believed to have singled out Mobil for
deterrent value because after having originally claimed on
labeling that Hefty bags were "degradable," the company had
later said publicly that it didn't believe the bags would
degrade when buried in landfills. Mr. Gray said Mobil made
the claim because consumers were demanding degradable bags
and Hefty risked losing market share to competitors that were
making similar claims. Mr. Gray said company officials met
several times with the attorneys general to settle the case,
but those efforts apparently were unsuccessful.
   Attorney General Humphrey wasn't satisfied in late March
when Mobil indicated it would take "several months" to clear
the offending packaging from store shelves. Earlier this
month, government investigators found Hefty bags with very
prominent "degradable" labeling is still being sold. Mr. Gray
couldn't be reached for comment on when supplies of the old
packaging would be exhausted.
   Under federal and state laws, a company's decision to
voluntarily withdraw product claims doesn't preclude legal
action, Mr. Cutler said. "The purpose of an action would be
to get a court order specifying what kinds of claims a
company can make in the future. These cases will also provide
guidance for other companies," Mr. Cutler said.
   The FTC and the states are continuing to investigate a
variety of products, such as disposable diapers, hairsprays
and plastic foam containers, claiming to be degradable,
recyclable or environmentally friendly. Earlier this year,
DowBrands Inc., a unit of Dow Chemical Co., decided to delete
"recyclable" and "photodegradable" labeling from its
Handi-Wrap product line. Late last year, First Brands Corp.
began removing some degradability claims from its Glad brand
of trash bags.
   People close to the Mobil Chemical investigation said the
lawsuit would be filed in seven states: Minnesota, New York,
California, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Texas and Washington.
