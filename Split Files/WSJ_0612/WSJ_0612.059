   NEW YORK -- Debt ratings of General Dynamics Corp. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. were placed under review by Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc., after the
St. Louis-based aerospace companies disclosed they may face
second-quarter write-offs because of delays in developing the
A-12 Navy fighter plane.
   Placed on CreditWatch with negative implications by
Standard &amp; Poor's were McDonnell Douglas's single-A-minus
rated senior debt; triple-B-plus subordinated debt; and
preliminary single-A-minus rule 415 shelf-registered senior
debt; plus the McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. unit's
single-A-plus senior debt and single-A subordinated debt
ratings. The single-A-2 rating on the parent company's
commercial paper and single-A-1 rating on the finance unit's
commercial paper were affirmed. Total debt is about $4.9
billion.

   S&amp;P also placed General Dynamics' single-A-plus senior
debt, single-A subordinated debt and preliminary
single-A-plus rule 415 shelf-registered senior debt ratings
on CreditWatch with negative implications. About $710 million
of long-term debt is affected.
   Moody's said it will closely monitor developments on the
A-12 program "related to the potential cost overruns, their
magnitude, and the impact on the companies' cash flow as well
as their overall operating performance. Cost problems, if
significant, would have negative implications for the
companies' credit quality."
   A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said of the ratings
action: "We are a company with great long-term potential
that's experiencing some short-term difficulties, and we
believe that the steps we are taking now are the right ones
for the long term."
   A General Dynamics spokesman said the rating agencies'
actions were "not unexpected given the announcement regarding
the A-12."
