   CHICAGO -- A federal agent who worked undercover as a
futures trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange testified
that a former Merc member once threatened that he and another
undercover agent would be shot if the trader discovered they
were government agents.
   That disclosure, made in U.S. District court here during
the trial of three Merc members accused of fraudulent trading
in the Merc's Swiss franc futures pit, prompted defense
attorneys for the traders to ask for a mistrial. The
attorneys said the threat wasn't in any way related to the
activities of their clients. They also said prosecutors
should have told them of the agent's meeting with the former
trader before it was referred to in court testimony.

   Judge Ann Williams said she would delay ruling on the
mistrial motion until the attorneys for the accused traders
-- Robert Mosky, Danny Scheck and David Zatz -- elaborated on
their motion in writing. Other defense attorneys said it
would be highly unlikely for the judge to grant a mistrial
based on the agent's testimony.
   Randall Jannett, who posed as a corrupt Swiss franc
futures trader at the Merc in 1988, said Alan Fleishman, a
former Merc trader, threatened him and another Federal Bureau
of Investigation agent with "bullets in our brains" if he
discovered they worked for the FBI, Mr. Jannett said.
   Mr. Fleishman searched the agents for hidden tape
recorders, which they both wore into the trading pits each
day, but apparently didn't discover the hidden devices, Mr.
Jannett testified. The agent didn't say what aroused Mr.
Fleishman's suspicions.
   Mr. Fleishman couldn't be reached for comment.
   The apparent death threat, made on March 16, 1988, was
relevant to the government's case in that it demonstrated the
importance of maintaining false identities for the agents,
prosecutors said. Defense attorneys had earlier in the trial
tried to portray Mr. Jannett as a deceptive person for living
and working under an assumed identify for more than a year.
