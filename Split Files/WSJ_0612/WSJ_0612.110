   The fire-ravaged tanker crippled in the Gulf of Mexico
raises serious questions about responsibility for oil spills
off U.S. shores, even as major oil companies were already
scrambling to limit their liability in such incidents.
   As of late yesterday, the Norwegian-flagged tanker Mega
Borg was lying about 57 miles southeast of Galveston, Texas,
oozing some of the 38 million gallons of crude in the ship's
hold. The ship caught fire early Saturday morning and later
explosions turned surrounding oil-coated seas into an
inferno. Two seamen were killed and two others remain
missing. Fears that the ship might sink raised the specter of
a possible oil spill three times as large as that of the
Exxon Valdez last year off Alaska.

   So far, costs of fighting the fire and containing the oil
were being born by the ship's owner, according to U.S.
authorities. The oil company that produced the crude,
France's Elf Aquitaine Inc., and the Texas facilities where
the oil was headed disavowed responsibility.
   "Elf was not the shipper and we don't believe we're
liable," said a spokesman, who flew to Houston from Paris on
Sunday. But he promised, "We're certainly going to do
anything in conjunction with the Coast Guard and the ship
owner to contain any potential threat to the environment."
   Though no one has suggested that in this case the shipping
company will attempt to avoid liability, the incident renews
concerns over who would -- and more important, could -- pay
to clean up a giant spill off the U.S. Right now, legal
experts say, liability for any spill and cleanup belongs to
tanker operators.
   But unless the tanker is owned and operated by a big oil
company, as the Exxon Valdez is, there's some question about
whether any shipper's pockets would be deep enough to cover a
disaster on that scale. Exxon Corp. so far has shouldered
more than $2 billion in costs in the Alaskan cleanup now
entering its second summer.
   Ironically, yesterday one of the world's largest oil
companies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group took a step directly aimed
at reducing its liabilities as a tanker operator by curbing
the number of its own ships being sent to the U.S. The
company will hire independent ships instead, which means
their owners, not Shell, would face potential spill
liability.
   The Anglo-Dutch oil company decided its ships no longer
will carry about 40,000 of the 180,000 oil barrels they now
haul daily into dozens of U.S. ports, idling as many as four
of the company's 46 owned or managed tankers world-wide.
   Although relatively minor in terms of Shell's overall
shipping, the move could encourage others to follow suit. If
the practice spreads, higher U.S. gasoline prices and
increased risks of oil spills as smaller and less-qualified
operators handle more oil imports could result, some analysts
predicted. The impact "could be a half cent a gallon as an
extra environmental price" for gasoline, said Jeremy Elden,
an oil analyst at U.K. brokers UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew.
   "We have looked again at our {U.S.} shipping operations in
the light of the fallout from the Valdez situation," said Ian
McGrath, managing director of Shell International Marine Ltd.
in London. "We face largely unlimited and uninsurable damage
claims" from spills in the U.S., exposure that doesn't exist
in most other nations, he added.
   Shell's groupwide coverage totals about $1 billion. The
company hasn't "been involved in any spills which we would
call major" in the past decade, Mr. McGrath stressed. But
open-ended U.S. claims for billions of dollars are "the sort
of risk I'm not prepared to take anymore."
   Other shippers may well follow Shell's lead. "When Shell
makes a decision, all the responsible {tanker} owners
seriously consider the matter," said Kristian Fugelsang,
shipping policy manager of the International Association of
Independent Tanker Owners, an Oslo group that represents more
than half of the world's tanker tonnage. The number of
independent operators likely to copy Shell's move "depends on
how they view the prospects for getting insurance," Mr.
Fugelsang said.
   In the Gulf of Mexico accident, parties quickly tried to
distance themselves. "We were buying oil delivered," said
James Smith, president of Crown Central Petroleum Corp. in
Baltimore, which was awaiting delivery of the Angolan crude
to its Pasadena, Texas, refinery. "Title and risk pass only
when the crude passes our reception point. It belongs to
Elf," he said.
   Mr. Smith conceded that the potential for liability if the
Mega Borg were to unleash its full cargo is huge. "It sure is
scary," he said. "It's a consideration every time that you
get something like this."
   The tanker's destination was actually a terminal operated
by Atlantic Richfield Co. in Texas City, Texas, which then
was to transport oil to Crown by pipeline. "We don't have
anything to do with this," said an Arco spokesman in Long
Beach, Calif. "Arco operates the terminal but it was not our
oil."
   Attempts to ascertain the owner of the Mega Borg
illustrate the complexity of the international shipping
industry. The Coast Guard said the U.S. agent for the Mega
Borg is Biehl &amp; Co. in Galveston. A person answering the
phone for Biehl who declined to give his name said, "We have
no comments at this office." He said the ship's owner was
K.S. Mega Borg II of Norway. Efforts to reach the company
there were unsuccessful late yesterday.
   But according to some Norwegian news accounts, the owner
of the tanker is called Hafslund Nycomed A/S. By other
accounts, the ship is just under 50%-owned by a company
called Mosvolds Rederi AS of Norway with the rest held by
private shipowners, and the ship is operated by a separate
concern.
   Concerns about liability raised by the Mega Borg accident
were already growing after a tanker spill just last week in
New York Harbor and another earlier this year near Huntington
Beach, Calif.
   In last week's spill, the buyer of the oil said it wasn't
responsible because the oil never got to its dock. "It's not
ours until it's delivered," said a spokesman for
Houston-based Coastal Corp. "It wasn't delivered." The tanker
owner has been paying for and coordinating the New York
Harbor cleanup.
   But in the California spill, the buyer of the oil, British
Petroleum Co., took a different tack. Though the company
maintains it didn't have to, BP nonetheless coordinated a $30
million cleanup. "The primary responsibility is on the vessel
owner in the event of a spill," said John Morgan, a BP senior
vice president, crude trading and transportation. And BP said
the cost will be passed on to the shipping concern.
   But BP had a clause in its contract with the vessel that
allowed it to step in. "We recognize that many tanker owners
have most of their assets on the water and don't have a
wealth of personnel shoreside who could be quickly mobilized
to clean up a spill like that," said Chuck Webster, BP's
crisis manager who oversaw its mobilization. By quickly
taking charge, BP may also have headed off some of the kind
of criticism that Exxon faced.
   Actually -- though Exxon might not agree -- industry
officials now say that Alaska was fortunate that the ship
operator there was a wealthy oil company like Exxon instead
of a company that operates only tankers. "It's an absolute
certain fact that we're lucky it was Exxon," said Bob Skall,
a U.S. Coast Guard assistant chief in the environmental
response division in Washington.
   The recent series of events may renew pressure on Congress
to send President Bush an oil-spill prevention and liability
bill that has been stalled on Capitol Hill for six months.
The House and Senate passed similar versions of the
legislation last year in the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill
but have been unable to work out deep differences over
whether to require double hulls on tankers.
   Among other provisions, the legislation would raise
minimum and also set maximum liability limits for tankers,
barges and oil facilities, although states could still
enforce their own stricter liability laws. Federal
compensation and cleanup costs beyond the proposed liability
limits would be paid out of a new $1 billion fund financed by
a five-cent-a-barrel tax on domestic and imported oil.
   The oil industry and its shippers have been arguing for
limits. Without ceilings, "you would end up with only the
unscrupulous owners" or single-ship companies "prepared to
take the chance of going" to the U.S., maintained Mr.
Fugelsang of the international tanker owners' group.
   "That's a distinct possibility," said Kenneth Norris, an
attorney for Boyar, Norton &amp; Blair in Houston who is also
commander of the Coast Guard Reserves in Galveston. "A lot of
the shipping companies are shells, so you can't get to the
parents' assets."
