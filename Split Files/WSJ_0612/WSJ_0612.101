   Mitsubishi Metal Corp. said it posted a 27% rise in
consolidated pretax profit in the year ended March 31 to
34.48 billion yen ($224.5 million) from 27.26 billion yen in
the previous fiscal year.
   The Japanese company's net income jumped 32% to 15.15
billion yen, or 22.55 yen a share, from 11.48 billion yen, or
18.68 yen a share.

   Mitsubishi Metal said revenue dropped 7.3% to 789.18
billion yen from 851.29 billion yen because of a change in
accounting policy. The change removed proceeds from gold and
silver trading from the overall revenues category.
   Mitsubishi Metal forecasts sharply higher consolidated
sales and earnings levels for the current fiscal year because
they include predictions for Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement Co.'s
performance in the last four months of the year. The two
companies will merge Dec. 1.
   Sales are seen at 914 billion yen, pretax profit at 43
billion yen, and net income at 18.5 billion yen.
