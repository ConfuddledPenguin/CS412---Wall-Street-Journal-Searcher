   CHICAGO -- Information Resources Inc. said it has formed
an office of the chief executive, which will include both the
position of chief executive officer and chief operating
officer.
   The marketing-information concern said the office will be
shared by 42-year-old Gian Fulgoni, who has been the chief
executive and who continues as vice chairman, and James
Andress, 51, who has been the chief operating officer and
continues as president.

   Information Resources' chairman, John Malec, 45, said the
action "formalizes" the structure that has been in place at
the company for the last six months. The new office, he said,
"isn't very different from our past structure. We've operated
with an executive committee since our inception."
