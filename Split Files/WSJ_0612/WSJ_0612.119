   Huffy Corp. said it expects to receive a refund of excess
duties on bicycle tires and tubes totaling $700,000 after
legal fees and taxes, but the gain will be partially offset
by an after-tax charge of about $350,000 to increase bad debt
reserves.
   Net effect of the two items will be to increase profit for
the second quarter by three cents a share, the Dayton, Ohio,
company said. For the 1989 second quarter, the bicycle,
juvenile products and retail service concern earned $5.3
million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of $127.3 million.

   Huffy said the refund of duties on bicycle tire and tube
combinations was the result of a lawsuit it filed in 1983.
The company won a lower court ruling, which the U.S. Customs
Service appealed. But the agency recently dropped the appeal,
Huffy said.
   The increase in bad debt reserves results from financial
problems at major retail store chains, Huffy said,
particularly Ames Department Stores Inc., Rocky Hill, Conn.,
which is operating under protection of Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code. Ames said it will close about
one-third of its stores.
   Huffy sells its bicycles, basketball goals and juvenile
products mainly through mass merchandisers, such as Ames.
