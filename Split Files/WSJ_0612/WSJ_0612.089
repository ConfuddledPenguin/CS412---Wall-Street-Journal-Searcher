   WASHINGTON -- In the search for political advantage on the
savings-and-loan mess, the chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee gave a gloomy assessment of the Bush
administration's cleanup efforts so far.
   In an unusually detailed, two-hour speech before an empty
Senate chamber, Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) painstakingly
tried to put the administration on the hook for snags in the
S&amp;L industry bailout, providing potential fodder for the
Democrats to exploit in future elections.

   He chided the administration for the slow sale of seized
S&amp;L assets, for not pursuing fraud aggressively and for only
recently acknowledging that cleanup costs will more than
double from its original estimates to more than $300 billion
over the next 10 years.
   Sen. Riegle was careful not to make inflammatory
accusations; he is himself under investigation by the Senate
Ethics Committee for his association with Charles Keating,
who presided over the costliest thrift failure ever. "It is
still too early to predict with confidence how the entire
thrift-reform and resolution process will work out in the
years ahead," he said.
   But with discussions looming on how to raise new funds
necessary for the bailout next year, he urged Congress to
agree only to a predetermined sum -- not to allow the
administration to spend whatever it deems necessary, as
suggested by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. "I believe
the blank-check approach could be dangerous and inconsistent
with Congress's oversight responsibilities," Sen. Riegle
said.
   Thus, every time the administration requested new funds,
it would be called on the carpet by Congress to explain why
the cleanup costs had increased.
   A senior Treasury official defended the thrift-bailout law
and the progress of the cleanup, and said that in the current
quarter it would very likely meet its ambitious goal of
selling 141 insolvent S&amp;Ls. Slow sales of government-seized
S&amp;L real estate, the official said, can't be helped, and
result from depressed real-estate prices. "It's a reality of
the markets," he said.
   With Congress also taking heat for the S&amp;L mess, Sen.
Riegle took pains to say that the cleanup law was drafted by
the Bush administration, and that responsibility for its
success or failure should rest with the administration. "No
major substantive amendments were added on the Senate floor,"
he said. That included the administration's plan to raise
funds through special bonds, which will pile another $12
billion in interest costs on the final bill.
   He was more critical of the administration's slow sale of
thrifts and their bad investments, while acknowledging "it's
an enormous job." To date, he said, all sales of sick thrifts
have left bad investments on the government's hands for later
sale. The administration, he said, "has barely started on its
real asset-disposition job."
