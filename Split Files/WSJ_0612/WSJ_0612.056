   NEW YORK -- What is Pan Am worth?
   According to the stock market, more than a third of a
billion dollars. Yet according to the bond market, the stock
of the deeply troubled and money-losing airline should be
practically worthless.

   Pan Am's three issues of senior debt, which have a face
value of $380 million, are trading at 30 to 40 cents on the
dollar. At least in theory, if a company's creditors can't be
fully paid, its stock, which ranks lower among its financial
obligations, is next to worthless.
   Yet even as the bond market discounts Pan Am's bonds by
about two-thirds, Pan Am stock closed on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday at 2 1/2, or $370 million for the 148
million shares.
   "It's totally ridiculous," says Jon Bauer, a managing
director at Oppenheimer who runs the firm's high-yield
department. "Either the bond market is too cheap or the stock
is too high."
   Like many other companies with heavy debts, Pan Am is
suffering from a sort of market schizophrenia. "Generally,
people that buy stock, many of them retail investors, aren't
aware that the bonds are trading where they are," Mr. Bauer
says. With distressed companies, "it's very rare that you
find a smart guy buying the stock rather than the bonds."
   Of course, Mr. Bauer, who works on the bond side, may be
accused of professional bias. But it's indisputable that many
stock investors are blissfully ignorant of the bond market.
And corporate bonds probably do attract a more sophisticated
breed.
   In the stock market, people tend to say, "The stock is at
$1; it must be a buy. It isn't always true," says John
Boland, publisher of Bankruptcy Values.
   "You have two different kinds of analysts," says Jay H.
Lustig, head of high yield at Drake Capital Securities in
Santa Monica, Calif. Stock analysts "put a lot of faith in
business plans. Bond analysts put a lot of faith in the
balance sheet."
   While bond analysts pay attention to credit quality, he
says, stock analysts are more likely to be swayed by a
company's plans for growth (and few companies are planning
for shrinkage). Despite the slowdown in takeovers, stock
analysts still tout even troubled companies as potential
takeover bait.
   Consider the retailer Kay Jewelers, which has been
grappling with weak demand and a contraction in its bank
credit lines as well as occasional takeover rumors. Kay's 12
7/8% bonds are trading at just under 50 cents on the dollar,
a yield to maturity of 30%. Yet its stock closed on the Big
Board yesterday at 9 3/8, or a total of $115.3 million.
   "It's way out of line," says an investor who is bearish on
Kay's stock. "If you think the bond is going to be paid off,
then you shouldn't buy the stock unless you think it's going
to do better than 30% a year. . . . And if you don't think
the bond will be paid, why are you buying the stock? You
ought to head for the hills."
   In the heyday of Michael Milken, investors would pay much
more for a company's junk bonds than they would for its
stock. Now, the roles are reversed.
   The junk bond market treats the debt of companies such as
Bally Manufacturing, General Development, Jones Intercable,
Continental Airlines Holdings, Bank of New England, RJR
Nabisco and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich with newfound sobriety.
The stock market, by comparison, is relatively optimistic.
   Mr. Lustig says some canny investors try to profit from
the apparent disparity by doing an arbitrage: selling a stock
short, betting that it will drop, and buying the bond of the
same issuer.
   Such moves tend to narrow the disparities by driving stock
prices lower and bond prices higher. But short-sellers (who
sell borrowed stock, which they hope to return later at a
cheaper price) say that in many cases, including Pan Am's,
they are thwarted by a shortage of borrowable shares.
   And the arbitrage play is dicey. For one thing, if the
company is taken over, the short sale generally will produce
a loss, and the bond won't necessarily produce an offsetting
gain.
   "It's incredibly risky," says Tom Kempner, of Davidson
Kempner Partners. "You can get hammered on unfavorable
exchange offers." That is, in bankruptcy cases and in
out-of-court restructurings, stockholders usually get more
than expected -- and what they get is at the expense of
bondholders.
   Stockholders have one other advantage: Management is in
their corner. On the other hand, Mr. Kempner says, management
"stays up nights thinking about doing bad things to
bondholders."
   Chriss Street, a bankruptcy specialist with Seidler Amdec,
says the stocks of many distressed companies should be
treated as "stubs," the small sliver of equity in highly
leveraged companies, which offer a long-shot chance at
striking it rich.
   But for companies such as Pan Am, which is fighting for
survival and which has put its Northeast shuttle, one of its
few profitable operations, up for sale, the shot is
exceedingly long.
   The "real equity" in such heavily leveraged companies lies
in their bonds, says Marsh, Block trader Mark Zatz. While it
is true that the bonds' upside is limited -- they are
unlikely to rise above 100% of their face value -- that is a
long rise indeed for some bonds.
   "There is no reason to buy the stocks," Mr. Zatz says.
Even if the companies avoid a restructuring, he adds, it's
unlikely that the stock "will match the rate of return that
you're going to get on the bond."
   This situation makes the gap between stock and bond prices
all the more strange. Consider, for instance, Trans World
Airlines, another hurting carrier.
   TWA, owned by Carl Icahn, has a public issue of preferred
stock that yields about 20%. But two issues of TWA's junior
subordinated debentures trade at a yield of 36% to 40%,
meaning their price is cheaper than that of the preferred,
even though they rank senior to the preferred in terms of
credit priority.
   "It's absolutely laughable," says the well-known
short-seller James Chanos, head of Kynikos Associates, who
has sold short some of the preferred. "The market just hasn't
focused."
