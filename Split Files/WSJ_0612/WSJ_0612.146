   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange, in a long-awaited
report on program trading, proposes new and expanded trading
halts to be triggered during unruly markets.
   But the Big Board report, which is scheduled to be
released today, doesn't challenge the widespread use of
program trading in the stock and stock-index futures markets,
and it describes the dispute about the computer-aided trading
as partly a public-relations problem for Wall Street.

   The report is the result of six months of study by an
18-member "Blue-Ribbon Panel on Market Volatility and
Investor Confidence," headed by Roger B. Smith, chairman of
General Motors Corp. The Big Board formed the panel amid an
outcry about program trading, following the 190-point plunge
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 13, 1989, that
was blamed partly on computer-assisted program trading of
stocks and futures.
   The report, a preliminary copy of which was obtained by
this newspaper, makes a total of eight recommendations to
curb stock and futures markets volatility, some of them
involving new controls. These include a "four-tier circuit
breaker" that would halt trading for an hour when the Dow
industrials move up or down 100 points from the previous
day's close; 90 minutes when it moves 200 points; two hours
when it moves 300; and, likewise, two hours when it moves 400
points.
   These proposed trading halts are longer than previous
circuit breakers enacted by the Big Board. The report also
suggests that the Securities and Exchange Commission make it
easier for corporations to buy their own stock during
plunging markets.
   But in an unusual admission, the report virtually concedes
widespread "intermarket" trading abuses exist, involving the
stock, futures and options markets. The report suggests that
intermarket regulation and surveillance systems need to be
improved "to prevent undetected wrongdoing in today's complex
marketplace."
   Yet the report also repeatedly tries to assure investors
that the markets, despite the hair-raising plunges of recent
years, are basically in good shape.
   The report concludes: "First, although market fluctuations
are inevitable," the stock and futures markets "are
essentially stable and sound. Second, they are not `tilted'
against the individual investor. But there is ample room for
improvement, especially in increasing the public
understanding of the markets."
   Program trading involves rapid-fire, computer-aided trades
of large baskets of stocks and stock-index futures and
options. The most common form, index arbitrage, has been
blamed for contributing to sudden swings in the stock market,
including the 1987 stock market crash.
   Several dissents to the report are expected to be filed,
including one from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Merc,
a panel member, is expected to reject the recommendation that
a single federal agency coordinate stock and futures markets,
or at least the margin requirements in each. Chicago futures
markets set their own margins, or good-faith payments needed
to trade futures. The Chicago exchanges are fighting efforts
in Washington to give the SEC more power over the futures
markets.
   Wall Street executives say some major Wall Street
brokerage firms may step up their program trading activity
when the report is officially released at a major news
conference this afternoon.
   These firms, including a major program trader, Morgan
Stanley Group Inc., have in recent months pulled back from
the index arbitrage form of program trading for their own
accounts, though they are accommodating customers who want to
do program trading.
   The firms have said privately they wouldn't reconsider
trading for their own accounts until the Big Board report was
issued. Now, they are expected to increase their regular
program trading.
   Some firms that cater to individual investors have
remained steadfastly opposed to program trading. Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., for example,
stopped all forms of program trading last year and has said
it doesn't have any plans to resume it.
   A GM spokesman said Mr. Smith wasn't available to comment
yesterday. A Big Board spokesman declined to comment.
   Among the Big Board report's recommendations:
   -- Coordination by a single body of margin levels across
stocks, futures and options markets. This is something the
Chicago futures markets don't want, because they have wide
leeway now in setting their own margins.
   -- A new SEC rule to ease constraints on corporations'
ability to buy their own stock during volatile markets, and
to "pre-announce" their intentions to do so.
   -- New Big Board rules to allow market makers, or
specialists, to use options more easily to hedge their
positions in stocks.
   -- "Active efforts" by the stock and futures exchanges to
"work with the media and educate the public" about program
trading and related matters.
   -- New products to enable individual investors to protect
themselves from daily market swings.
   -- Better systems to detect intermarket trading abuses.
   -- One federal agency to regulate U.S. stock and futures
markets.
   -- A single federal agency to oversee margin requirements.
   Some institutional money managers are wary about any
additional regulation.
   Robert Arnott, chief investment officer at First Quadrant
Corp., which manages about $10 billion for institutions, said
he thinks margins for hedged positions on stock-index futures
are "at perfectly adequate levels. In fact, raising them
might restrict liquidity," which is the ability to buy and
sell securities easily. He said: "I think 1990 may be the
most dangerous year for the capital markets in the post-war
period. Most of the regulatory actions that have been
proposed {by Congress} would moderately or severely affect
liquidity, which is dangerous and counterproductive."
   Some of the Big Board panel's recommendations overlap
earlier ones from the Securities Industry Association, a
trade group, and the government's Brady report on the 1987
crash.
   The trading halts would technically be triggered by
specific percentage swings, either up or down, in the stock,
the stock-index futures or the index option markets. The
first trigger is a 3.7% movement, equivalent to about 100
points on the Dow, or 12 points on the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index traded in Chicago. Other triggering points
are 7.4%, 11.1% and 14.8% moves in the markets.
   The triggering points were determined partly by a Big
Board study, which showed that, on average, the public
believes a 60-point to 70-point change in the Dow is "a large
amount," a footnote in the Big Board report states.
   One of the public-relations moves suggested by the Big
Board panel is that the media report percentage changes in a
broad index, such as the S&amp;P or the Big Board composite
index, rather than point changes in the Dow when covering the
market. Percentage changes don't look as alarming as big
moves in the Dow, the reasoning goes.
   People close to the Big Board's program trading committee
said the panelists had several heated exchanges during the
six months of talks. They said GM's Mr. Smith didn't offer
his own opinions, but played the role of mediator.
   Some investors would like a ban on program trading, or at
least on index arbitrage, in which traders buy or sell large
baskets of stocks with offsetting futures and options trades.
But even though the panel included members from
public-oriented firms such as A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., Dean
Witter and Kemper Corp., any such ban was quickly dismissed
by the group. "I don't think anyone thought to eliminate
{program trading}," a person close to the panel said. "So why
spend time talking about it?"
