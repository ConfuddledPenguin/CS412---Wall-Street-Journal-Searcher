   A federal appeals court ruled that the Energy Department
must pay $250,000 in civil penalties to the state of Ohio
stemming from environmental problems at the nuclear weapons
facility in Fernald, Ohio.
   The decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Appeals Court in
Cincinnati, which could have an impact nationwide,
essentially bars the federal government from claiming that it
is immune from suits under state and federal pollution laws.
The decision is believed to be the first by a federal appeals
court to deal with the question.

   Ohio Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. said:
"This is an issue that's been a thorn in the side of states
and environmentalists for quite some time." Twenty-four other
states filed friend-of-the-court briefs backing Ohio.
   The Energy Department had claimed that it had sovereign
immunity against paying civil damages under the federal
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water
Act. In Washington, a spokeswoman said the department hadn't
seen the ruling and would have no comment until it was
reviewed by Energy and Justice Department attorneys.
   The federal government's 1,050-acre facility at Fernald
processes uranium for nuclear weapons production. Ohio and
the Energy Department have been battling over pollution
problems at the facility since 1984, when the state
Environmental Protection Agency first inspected the facility.
   In 1986, Ohio sued the Energy Department and private
contractors who had operated the Fernald facility, alleging
that they improperly disposed of hazardous wastes and
released radioactive materials into the environment and
polluted surface and ground water.
   In 1988, Energy Department officials acknowledged that the
government had ordered a previous operator of the Fernald
facility to continue dumping radioactive and hazardous wastes
at the site over a period of years. Late that year, the
department agreed to pay Ohio more than $1 million to settle
two suits. The department also agreed to allow Ohio to
inspect the facility and to oversee its cleanup. The
department has said it expects to spend $500 million to
improve Fernald and to bring it into compliance with Ohio
law.

   SHAREHOLDER GROUP wins $6.5 million in suit against health
company.
   A U.S. District Court jury in Las Vegas made the award to
certain shareholders of Sierra Health Services Inc. who had
charged the company with securities-laws violations related
to its 1985 initial public offering.
   The jury ruled Friday that Sierra Health and two of its
officers -- Anthony M. Marlon, chairman, president and chief
executive officer, and David B. Willis, a former director,
senior vice president and chief financial officer -- made
misrepresentations and omissions about a computer-information
system described in the offering prospectus. Mr. Willis left
the company in 1986.
   "The case isn't over yet," said a spokeswoman for the Las
Vegas company, which operates six subsidiaries including a
health maintenance organization and an insurance company. She
said the defendants "disagree" with the verdict and plan to
ask the court to set it aside. If the motion fails, the
defendants will appeal the decision, she said.
   Mr. Marlon said in a brief statement that the company has
the financial resources to pay the award if it is ultimately
upheld. The verdict "should have no impact on the company's
current and ongoing day-to-day activities," he said.
   Last year, Sierra Health had net income of $3.2 million,
or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $136.7 million. One
securities analyst has estimated that the company will earn
$5.3 million, or 90 cents a share, this year. In American
Stock Exchange composite trading, Sierra Health shares fell
75 cents to $6.625.
   The lawsuit, certified as a class action, was filed by
stockholder David Gould in Oct. 1986. The class includes all
holders who purchased Sierra Health's common stock during the
period from April 11, 1985 through Aug. 5, 1986.
   The jury exonerated Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and Sanford
C. Bernstein &amp; Co., which underwrote the offering and were
named as defendants in the suit.

   MANVILLE TRUST says it's considering ways to ease current
cash shortfall.
   The trust, whose funding has come under criticism from a
federal judge in New York and a New York state justice, also
filed a court motion informing the judges that it has met
with Manville Corp. to discuss the problem. The trust, which
is independent of the Denver company, was set up as part of
Manville's bankruptcy-court reorganization plan in 1986 to
pay asbestos-personal injury claimants.
   In a statement, the trust's chairman, John C. Sawhill,
defended the trust's handling of the 152,000 claims that have
been filed so far. The trust has said the current shortfall
-- which means new claimants won't be paid for about 20 years
-- was expected. The judges, however, have said that delay is
unacceptable.
   The trust said it is considering various options,
including the immediate sale of Manville stock and borrowing.
It may also start paying claims in installments, so that
claimants won't have to wait several years before receiving
any money at all. The trust, funded by Manville, isn't
scheduled to receive any additional money from the company
until August 1991.
   In its motion filed with Judge Jack B. Weinstein in
federal court in Brooklyn and state Justice Helen Freedman in
Manhattan, the trust said it will file a more detailed
response to the judges' concerns by July 9.
   The judges said they will consider taking action against
the trust and the company if changes aren't made in the
trust's funding.

   DELTA AIR LINES is sued for libel by pilot fired after
1988 crash.
   In a case filed in state court in Fort Worth, Texas,
Steven Judd alleges that Delta wrongfully blamed him for
contributing to the crash at Dallas/Fort Worth International
Airport that killed 14 people. Mr. Judd was the engineer on a
three-man flight crew that Delta publicly faulted for the
crash. The airline said the crew had failed to properly set
the wing flaps for takeoff. All three were terminated.
   But Mr. Judd asserts that he was exonerated by the
National Transportation Safety Board. Last September, the
NTSB criticized the captain and first officer for "inadequate
cockpit discipline," but not Mr. Judd, the second officer.
The report also said Delta hadn't moved forcefully enough to
correct deficiencies among flight crews.
   In a complaint seeking unspecified damages, Mr. Judd
alleges that Delta's "false public statements" about his role
in the crash damaged his reputation so badly that major
airlines won't hire him. He also accuses Delta of
fraudulently encouraging him to testify favorably for the
airline at NTSB hearings on the accident. A Delta spokesman
said Mr. Judd, as a member of the flight crew, had a
responsibility to ensure that the flaps were properly set.
   "We stand firmly behind our position to fire the pilots,
including second officer Judd," he said.

   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT is looking for a new criminal-division
chief.
   Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis, the Reagan
administration appointee who now heads the unit, probably
will leave soon, according to people familiar with the
situation. The exact timing of his departure isn't known, and
Mr. Dennis hasn't responded to requests for interviews.
   The Bush administration was expected eventually to name
its own person to the prestigious law enforcement post.
Justice Department officials have denied emphatically that
Mr. Dennis's probable departure has anything to do with a
recent shakeup of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's personal
staff. "The attorney general has great confidence in Mr.
Dennis's skills," said Dan Eramian, a department spokesman.
"There is no vacancy and nothing announced."
   Mr. Dennis, a former U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, has
served as the Bush administration's spokesman on a variety of
controversial issues, including expansion of the federal
death penalty.
   Mr. Dennis has come under fire from congressional
Democrats who blame him and Mr. Thornburgh for failing to
press white-collar prosecutions with sufficient zeal.
   The white-collar issue has been heightened by the scandals
involving the savings and loan industry and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.

   CHARACTER WITNESSES line up in defense of John A. Mulheren
Jr.
   Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of Bear, Stearns & Co.; Samuel
Belzberg, chairman of First City Financial Corp.; and Jack
Nash, general partner of Odyssey Partners all provided
testimony for Mr. Mulheren in his securities fraud trial in
federal court in New York.
   "I would trust everything I have to John Mulheren," Mr.
Greenberg testified. "I just hope that each of my children
has a friend like John Mulheren," added Mr. Greenberg, a
close friend and business associate of Mr. Mulheren's. Mr.
Belzberg, whose Vancouver-based company invested $80 million
in a partnership formerly run by Mr. Mulheren, said he
believed Mr. Mulheren is "a sincere, hard-working, honorable
gentleman."
   Messrs. Greenberg and Belzberg and Mr. Nash, who runs
Odyssey, a New York-based investment firm, all said they knew
nothing about Mr. Mulheren's dealings with Ivan F. Boesky,
the convicted former stock speculator whose cooperation with
the government led to the case against Mr. Mulheren.
   The defense is expected to continue its case today.
