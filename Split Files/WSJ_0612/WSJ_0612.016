   At most firms is standard stuff.
   But our boss lives by the philosophy
   That they will if he pounds hard enough.

   A Thinning Experience

   Swimming of laps or isometric stancing,
   No skipping rope, running, jogging or hopping.
   I just take the kids when I go shopping.
   -- Gail Cooke.
