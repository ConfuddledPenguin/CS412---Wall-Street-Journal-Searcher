   FOXBORO, Mass. -- Foxboro Co. said it is "exploring
alternatives" that could lead to the acquisition of some or
all of its stock by another company.
   The maker of industrial process controls said it is
considering "a possible strategic alliance with a limited
number of firms which could add complementary strengths" to
Foxboro's technology.

   Officials of the company, which is struggling to turn
around after losing money for several quarters and omitting
its 10-cent quarterly dividend, declined further comment.
   However, analysts noted that Foxboro's stock has risen in
recent weeks due to speculation that it might become a
takeover target. It closed yesterday at $30, up $1.50, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Robert Sullivan, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., noted
that about one-third of Foxboro's shares are held by the
widely scattered descendants of the founding Bristol family.
With the dividend omission, "probably some have been
disillusioned," he said.
   At its annual meeting in April, Foxboro added to its board
two new directors representing a group that said it had
acquired a 4.8% stake.
   The new directors are Purnendu Chatterjee, president of
Beall Technologies Inc., a North Bergen, N.J., computer parts
maker, and Alan R. McFarland, partner in McFarland, Dewey &amp;
Co. a New York investment firm. The proxy statement
identifies both as representatives of a group that also
includes investor George Soros. Mr. Soros and Mr. Chatterjee
were allied in two unsuccessful takeover attempts in the
mid-1980s.
   The proxy statement disclosed that the group holds a 4.8%
stake and had agreed to limit its holdings to no more than
9.9% until the end of this year. It also said that Foxboro
and the two new directors agreed that the men won't make
public comments on Foxboro.
   Foxboro has technologically advanced products and a good
customer base, analysts say, but it has repeatedly posted
disappointing earnings. Last year it reported a net loss of
$4.6 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $597.8
million.
   Mr. Sullivan of PaineWebber said he expects Foxboro's
earnings to come back in the second half, resulting in net
income of about 65 cents a share for the year and $1.75 a
share next year. "My position is it's undervalued, either
because of what it could earn a year or two out or because it
could be taken over at a premium to the present price," he
said.
