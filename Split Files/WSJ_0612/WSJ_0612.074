   In 1984, Mario Cuomo of New York electrified the
Democratic Convention with his tale of America as two cities,
one rich and one poor, permanently divided into two classes.
He talked about the rich growing richer and the poor becoming
poorer, with the conclusion that class conflict, if not
warfare, was the only result, and redistribution of wealth
the solution.
   With all due respect to Gov. Cuomo, he got it wrong.
America is not divided immutably into two static classes. But
it is separated or divided into two economies. One economy --
our mainstream economy -- is democratic and capitalist,
market-oriented and entrepreneurial. It offers incentives for
working families in labor and management. This mainstream
economy rewards work, investment, saving and productivity.
Incentives abound for productive economic and social
behavior.

   It was this economy, triggered by President Reagan's
supply-side revolution of tax cuts in 1981, that generated
21.5 million new jobs, more than four million new businesses,
relatively low inflation and higher standards of living for
most people. This economy has created more jobs in the past
decade than all of Europe, Canada and Japan combined. And
according to the U.S. Treasury, federal income taxes paid by
the top 1% of taxpayers has surged by more than 80% to $92
billion in 1987 from $51 billion in 1981.
   There is another economy -- a second economy that is
similar in respects to the East European or Third World
socialist economies. It functions in a fashion opposite to
the mainstream capitalist economy. It predominates in the
pockets of poverty throughout urban and rural America. This
economy has barriers to productive human and social activity
and a virtual absence of economic incentives and rewards. It
denies black, Hispanic and other minority men and women entry
into the mainstream. This economy works almost as effectively
as did hiring notices 50 years ago that read "No Blacks -- or
Hispanics or Irish or whatever -- Need Apply."
   The irony is that the second economy was born of desire to
help the poor, alleviate suffering, and provide a basic
social safety net. The results were a counterproductive
economy. Instead of independence, the second economy led to
dependence. In an effort to minimize economic pain, it
maximized welfare bureaucracy and social costs.
   All around the world, despite the resistance of the old
guard, freedom and free markets, democracy and capitalism are
increasingly on the march. East Europe is looking to us for
market-oriented answers, but so is East Harlem, East St.
Louis and East Los Angeles.
   If we are to present the example of democratic capitalism
and the rule of law to the rest of the world, we've got to
make it work for the low-income people and distressed
neighborhoods and communities right here in our own country.
Whether it's called bleeding-heart conservatism, capitalism
with a social conscience, or populist conservatism -- it's
the right thing to do, the right time to do it, and we're the
right people to help lead it.
   Let's step away from our orthodox notions and examine this
from afar. What if you wanted to create poverty? What
policies and principles would you use to destroy the economy
of cities and make people dependent on government? How would
you do it? Let me offer some suggestions:
   -- Impose steeply graduated and progressive tax rates and
then inflate the currency to push people into ever higher tax
brackets.
   -- Reward welfare and unemployment at a higher level than
working and productivity.
   -- Tax the entrepreneur who succeeds in the legal system
-- while permitting an underground, untaxed, economy.
   -- Reward people who stay in public housing more than
those who want to move up and out into private housing and
home ownership.
   -- Reward the family that breaks up rather than the family
that stays together.
   -- Encourage debt, borrowing and spending rather than
saving, investing and risk-taking.
   -- Weaken and in some cases destroy the link between
effort and reward.
   The startling fact in America today is that the highest
marginal tax rates are being paid not by the rich, but by
welfare mothers or unemployed fathers who want to take a job.
In most cities, a welfare mother would have to earn $15,000
to $18,000 in a private-sector job to earn the equivalent of
the average tax-free welfare payment.
   According to a study by Christopher Jencks and Kathryn
Edin in American Prospect magazine, a mother with two
children who is employed at about $5 an hour would take home
about 45 cents an hour less than if she were on welfare. She
loses nearly $4 a day after taking into account the loss of
government benefits, taxes and such work-related expenses as
transportation and child care.
   The heavily regulated U.S. housing market is another
example of government-created scarcity. Rent control in many
major cities has crippled rental housing by making it
unprofitable to be a landlord or investor. Rent controls do
not help the poor, because they cut apartment supply.
   Another glaring example of counterproductive government
policy is how the Department of Housing and Urban Development
had been spending more than $1,300 per unit to subsidize
vacant public housing -- housing often used as crack houses
for gangs and drug pushers. The Bush administration has
started a policy called Operation Occupancy under which only
units actually occupied by low-income people will receive
public housing subsidies.
   Let me outline some ideas for a national agenda to help
low income people and our nation find the keys that will
unlock the shackles of poverty and despair:
   -- Cut the capital-gains tax to 15%. Eliminate it in
distressed inner cities and rural communities that we would
designate as Enterprise Zones.
   When the top capital-gains tax rate was reduced to 20%
from 49%, the number of small-company start-ups more than
doubled, rising to 640,000 and creating 15 million jobs. By
dramatically reducing the capital-gains tax rate again, and
greenlining inner-city neighborhoods, we can expand the
economy and put that enormous job-creating potential to work
where it is needed most.
   -- Expand resident management and urban homesteading in
public housing to empower residents to buy their own homes
and enjoy the dignity of ownership.
   -- Widen use of housing vouchers and certificates to give
low-income families greater choice of where to live, while
expanding access to affordable housing for those most in
need.
   -- Reform the tax system to remove low-income families
from the tax rolls and dramatically increase the after-tax
income of welfare mothers and unemployed fathers who go to
work.
   In 1948, at the median income, a family of four paid
virtually no income tax and only $30 a year in direct Social
Security taxes (1%). This year, the same family's tax burden
would be more than $6,000. To reach a level comparable to
1948, the personal exemption -- the tax allowance for the
costs of nurturing children -- would have to be well over
$6,000 today. Instead, it is only $2,000.
   -- Expand the earned-income tax credit dramatically,
creating up to a $6,000 exemption for children under 16.
   -- Help the homeless. Congress should pass the
administration's new Shelter Plus Care program to expand
community-based mental-health facilities, drug-abuse
treatment, job training, and day care. This program will help
homeless Americans get shelter, transitional housing, and
support services to help them re-enter the mainstream
economy.
   -- Provide educational opportunity by expanding true
choice and competition through magnet schools, education
vouchers or tuition tax credits.
   -- Encourage Congress to pass President Bush's HOPE
legislation, including IRAs for first-time home buyers, the
low-income housing tax credit, and Operation Bootstrap
linking housing vouchers to strategies for gaining
self-sufficiency.
   A program like this would make the 1990s the decade in
which we win the war against poverty -- just as the decade of
the 1980s was the one in which we won the Cold War against
communism.
