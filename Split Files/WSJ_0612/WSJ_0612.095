   Seeking to boost its share in the inexpensive 35mm-camera
market, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y., introduced four
new compact cameras designed for beginners.
   The Star 35 cameras, which have suggested retail prices
from $44.95 to $79.95, will be smaller than slightly more
expensive existing Kodak models. All are designed for
point-and-shoot photography popular with beginners.

   Industry analysts said the line extension isn't a
significant investment for Kodak, but the company hopes the
move will increase sales of film and paper. Each new camera
comes with a roll of Kodacolor Gold 200 color-print film and
two AA-size Kodak Photolife alkaline batteries.
   Kodak had dropped out of the 35mm market in the 1970s.
Since the company re-entered the market in the mid-1980s, it
has concentrated on budget-minded starting photographers and
left the higher-margin market primarily to Japanese
companies.
