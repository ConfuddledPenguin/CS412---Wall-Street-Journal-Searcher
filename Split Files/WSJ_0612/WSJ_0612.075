   The economy is sluggish, real-estate values are slumping
nationwide, the savings-and-loan bailout grows more expensive
and the Northeastern states are threatening to sink into the
Atlantic. It's too bad Washington can't come up with an
economic policy to get us moving again.
   What we need is a policy that would increase the values of
real estate, and for that matter other assets held by sick
savings and loans. Some S&amp;Ls now headed for the tank might
make it after all, and in any event all the assets the
government is taking over would be worth more, reducing the
cost to taxpayers. It would be all the better if the policy
could boost tax revenues for Mario Cuomo, Michael Dukakis and
Jim Florio, so they wouldn't have to tax their economies
under water. And, of course, doing these things would add a
new spark to the nationwide economy. They would put new pep
into the economic expansion, which set peacetime records on
the basis of tax cuts but now seems a bit peaked.

   Let's see; anything in the macroeconomic pharmacopeia that
would cure these current ills? Do we dare? Can we talk of
forbidden drugs? Is it time to cast aside childhood taboos?
Let's whisper the unmentionable prescription: cut the capital
gains tax.
   Real-estate values would improve overnight, for example,
since the unmentionable prescription would lower a tax on
potential gains. The tax was in fact lower when the
properties now being liquidated were initially purchased;
their current low values in part reflect a higher tax. The
same is true, of course, for junk bonds, another S&amp;L asset.
But, of course, thanks to expansive deposit insurance,
taxpayers are getting stuck with these assets at their
current eroded values. The higher tax rate doesn't help
government revenues if there are no gains to tax; and if
there are losses in the S&amp;L portfolios, government
expenditures have to increase (though, for what it's worth,
probably outside the Gramm-Rudman calculations).
   The current round of budget problems in New York and
Massachusetts, remember, started with faulty estimates of tax
receipts for capital gains. Old and developed states hold a
lot of capital assets. A lower tax on these assets would give
their economies a nice shot in the arm. And whether or not
you think they deserve it, their prosperity is interlinked
with the nation's as a whole.
   Alas, the prescription remains unmentionable, especially
in the company of Governors Cuomo, Dukakis and Florio. They
have a strong ally in Senate Majority Leader Mitchell, who
personally was the only thing keeping the Congress from
writing the unmentionable prescription last year.
   This year the prescription has vanished into the maw of
the budget summit. There are those who say the economy can't
have the prescription unless it also takes a lot of poison in
higher taxes. With one side pushing for higher taxes and the
other for better budget procedures, it may be some time
before the summiteers find their prescription pad, and if
they do it's not sure that anyone will be able to decipher
their handwriting.
   The doctors at the Treasury, for that matter, haven't
helped matters much. They keep insisting on diluting the
active ingredients in an attempt to cure some other disease.
In order to comply with Congress's computer models to predict
deficits, their proposal had a bottom rate of only 19.6%, and
that was only for assets locked up for at least three years.
The Bush administration seems to forget why it first came up
with the prescription.
   GOP Senators Bob Kasten of Wisconsin and Connie Mack of
Florida and Democrat Richard Shelby of Alabama will soon get
the prescription back on the table, though, with a bill to
cut the capital gains tax back to 15%, the rate George Bush
proposed in his presidential campaign as opposed to the 33%
typical today. By Friday, they hope to have more than 20
co-sponsors, including several Democrats.
   Kasten-Mack gets the debate back to the main issue of
economic growth. Congress's computer models predict only
short-term increases in tax revenue from a lower capital
gains tax. In the real world, though, a lower capital gains
rate would instantly mean that assets of all kinds would
suddenly be worth more. Every time an asset is sold at a
gain, the government gets its take, so tax revenues would
probably rise even with the lower rate, just as they did
after the tax rate was cut in 1978. And if it cuts the cost
of the S&amp;L bailout, the real deficit -- government demands on
the credit markets -- would be lower.
   The U.S. economy may weather its current mild stagflation;
the stock market has set new records in the face of the
problems. But if anyone in Washington wants to help with the
problem areas and take out some insurance on the broader
picture, the prescription is clear enough. Except that it's
unmentionable.
