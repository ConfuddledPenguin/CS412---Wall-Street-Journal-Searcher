   JUSTICES STRUCK DOWN a federal law against desecrating the
flag.
   The Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional on the
same grounds the court used to invalidate a Texas statute a
year ago. The court's 5-4 decision is expected to touch off a
political battle in Congress to pass a constitutional
amendment protecting the flag. The justices also ruled that
the federal government may order state National Guard troops
to participate in peacetime training abroad without a
governor's consent.

   GORBACHEV AGREED to meet with presidents of the three
Baltic republics.
   The Soviet president scheduled a meeting today with the
leaders of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia to discuss their
recent independence moves, which Moscow has termed
unconstitutional. It will be the first such meeting.
Gorbachev has said the republics are free to pursue
independence, but insists they do so in accordance with
Soviet constitutional guidelines that were established in
April and require a referendum, legislative approval and a
wait of up to five years.
   The three Baltic presidents formed a united front last
month to press their drives to restore the independence the
republics lost when annexed by Stalin.
