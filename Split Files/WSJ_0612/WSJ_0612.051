   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced
Chase Manhattan Corp.'s senior debt rating to Baa-2 from
Baa-1 as a result of deterioration in the bank holding
company's large commercial real estate portfolio.
   The rating agency said that although Chase's commercial
real estate portfolio is diversified, it remains vulnerable
to further deterioration in national markets. Moody's noted,
however, that Chase has offset to some extent the
deterioration of the real estate portfolio by "considerable
capital building and business rationalization efforts."

   The company's commercial paper rating of Prime-2 wasn't
changed. But some debt issues of the bank subsidiary were
also lowered, including the rating of long-term deposits,
which was reduced to A-3 from A-2.
   Moody's downgrading of Chase is the latest in a series of
ratings reviews that have resulted in downgrades of several
bank holding companies, including Citicorp. The reviews come
on the heels of intensified regulatory scrutiny of real
estate loans, especially in the Northeast, where the
deteriorating real estate market has forced banks to add
substantially to provisions for loan losses.
   A Chase spokesman said "we are disappointed by the Moody's
announcement, particularly since Moody's acknowledged our
capital-building activities, which, over the last two years
have added $1.3 billion to our common equity base, our
diversified portfolios and revenue streams as well as
significant undervalued assets and increased core funding."
   Earlier, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its A rating of
Chase Manhattan's senior debt and its A plus rating for
deposits.
   Moody's announcement came after financial markets closed
yesterday. Chase shares closed yesterday at $26.50, off 50
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
