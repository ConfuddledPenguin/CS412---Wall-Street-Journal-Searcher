   WASHINGTON -- John Poindexter was sentenced to six months
in prison for lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair
while he was former President Ronald Reagan's national
security adviser in late 1985 and 1986.
   Mr. Poindexter, who was sentenced in federal court here,
was the first of the Iran-Contra defendants to receive a
prison term. He was also the most senior Reagan
administration official tried and convicted on charges of
concealing U.S. arms sales to Iran and White House support
for the Nicaraguan rebels during a period when Congress had
banned such aid.

   Explaining his decision, Judge Harold Greene said that
incarcerating the retired Navy admiral would deter other high
public officials from misleading Congress. Failing to
imprison Mr. Poindexter "would be tantamount to a statement
that to lie to and to obstruct Congress was of no great
moment," Judge Greene said. Mr. Poindexter declined to make a
statement when given the opportunity by the judge.
   Mr. Poindexter will remain free while he appeals his
conviction on five felony counts of making false statements
to Congress and obstructing the inquiries of lawmakers into
the Iran-Contra affair. He was sentenced to serve six months
in prison for each of the counts, but the terms will be
served concurrently. Judge Greene didn't impose a fine.
   The judge had wide discretion in determining the sentence
because Mr. Poindexter's actions took place before the
November 1987 effective date of federal guidelines that would
have made a prison term mandatory for such felonies.
   Mr. Poindexter's prison sentence pulls a reluctant
President Bush back into the biggest White House scandal
since Watergate. Mr. Bush, who has attempted to play down his
role in the Iran-Contra affair as Mr. Reagan's vice
president, must now decide whether to pardon Mr. Poindexter.
A Bush spokesman said the president wouldn't immediately
comment on the sentence.
   Mr. Poindexter's attorneys, who maintain that he didn't
break any laws, had asked Judge Greene to consider their
client's previously stellar Navy career and not give him a
prison term.
   Prosecutors from the office of Independent Counsel
Lawrence Walsh had sought a prison sentence as a warning that
executive branch officials must tell Congress the truth.
After the court proceeding, Dan Webb, the lead trial
prosecutor, called the result "very fair and very proper."
   Leading Iran-Contra defendants who were spared prison
terms despite convictions include Robert McFarlane, another
former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to four
misdemeanors of withholding information from Congress, and
Oliver North, a mid-level national security aide who was
convicted of three felonies, including helping to obstruct
congressional inquiries. Both men were sentenced to two
years' probation, as well as being forced to pay fines and do
community service.
   Prosecutors in the Poindexter trial argued successfully
that previous Iran-Contra sentences shouldn't preclude prison
time for Mr. Poindexter.
   Some criminal law experts agreed with this position. "I'm
not surprised by the sentence," said Samuel Dash, the chief
counsel to the special Senate Watergate Committee and now a
law professor at Georgetown University. "Here was somebody
who went to trial and was right next to the president," Mr.
Dash said. In contrast, Mr. McFarlane admitted his guilt and
Mr. North was "a middle-ranking" official, "not one of the
bosses," Mr. Dash added.
