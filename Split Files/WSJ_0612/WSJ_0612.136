   Time for a Fresh Look
   At Company Doctors?

   RISING MEDICAL costs are forcing some companies to
reconsider an old form of employee benefit: the company
doctor.
   Over the past decade, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Tenneco
Inc. and America West Airlines Inc. all have begun sponsoring
their own clinics. In July, Quad/Graphics Inc., a closely
held printing company, will open a clinic in Pewaukee, Wis.;
it plans eventually to provide medical care for all its
nearly 5,000 employees. The Stouffer Corp. unit of Nestle
S.A. also expects to open a clinic for 4,000 Cleveland-area
employees this year.
   Company-run clinics fell out of fashion decades ago, but
businesses that continued to offer onsite care -- including
Southern California Edison Co., Gillette Co. and Gates Corp.
-- say it helps check unnecessary diagnostic tests and
eliminates costly, inconvenient paper work. The clinics also
avoid the cost-shifting that occurs when doctors boost
charges to company-insured patients to offset lower payments
for Medicare and Medicaid patients.
   Southern California Edison estimates that its clinics,
which date back to 1903, keep costs about 20% below what
they'd be on the open market.
   Some consulting firms see business for themselves in
equipping clinics and contracting with doctors when companies
don't want to do that work independently. Using a middleman
may also guard against violations of confidentiality. "If a
manager asks whether Joe was in the clinic, we say, `That's
none of your business,' " says C. Victor Williams, president
of MediCenter Inc., which has opened three clinics for
Goodyear.
   Still, this type of venture is a big step for most
companies. Since opening a dental center last year, Fort
Howard Corp. has given some thought to taking on the greater
complexities of a medical clinic. But "the idea scares us a
lot more than this {dental center} does," says Michael
Riordan, a personnel executive at the company.
                                                                                                       

   Du Pont Is Heading Off
   Cost of Back Injuries
                                                                                                       

   FOR THREE YEARS, chemical and oil giant Du Pont Co. has
been waging an allout campaign against employee back
injuries, and the company is beginning to see results.
   Du Pont estimates that back problems, whether from
on-the-job or at-home injuries, cost it $40 million in 1987
at its U.S. operations alone, considering employee pay during
lost workdays and medical expenses.
   But a preliminary calculation, based on surveys at several
plants whose findings are extrapolated to others, indicates
the company saved $10 million last year in the U.S. By 1992,
the company intends to cut bad-back costs world-wide by $50
million annually.
   Some 500 employees helped set up prevention programs at
their worksites. About 50,000 -- a third of the work force --
have gotten several hours of training. Between $8 million and
$12 million has been invested in the effort to date.
   A few of the preventive measures are state of the art. One
of Du Pont's consultants, Biomechanics Corp. of America, has
provided hundreds of pocket-sized, electrode-equipped
"ergometers," which measure the force of muscle contractions
during training sessions. The signal from an overstressed
muscle prompts a warning tone.
   Other steps are simple, such as unloading heavy bags on an
elevated platform so that workers don't have to stoop to lift
them.
                                                                                                       

   Rhode Island Doctors
   Team Up for High Tech
                                                                                                       

   THE EMERGENCE of big ticket medical technology often
raises questions about how wisely it will be used after
hospitals have rushed to buy it. Now, hospitals in Rhode
Island have allayed these concerns through an intensive
statewide training program that uses shared equipment.
   With encouragement from state health planners, all 10 of
the private general hospitals in Rhode Island formed a
network in 1988 to buy and share magnetic resonance scanners,
the latest generation of diagnostic imaging equipment. Two
fixed-site machines and one rotated among hospitals by
trailer are operating now, and another mobile unit will be
added this summer.
   The training takes radiologists through 160 hours of
course work and hands-on instruction. That is followed by 80
hours of "overreading," in which the doctors work
independently but have the images given a second look by
outside experts. Nineteen doctors have been certified by the
network so far.
   "One of the concerns about high-tech equipment is that it
replaces the thought process, that it's just used to shotgun
all comers," says Herbert Kressel, a radiologist at the
University of Pennsylvania, and medical director for the
Rhode Island network.
   He adds that magnetic resonance imaging is especially
complicated by frequent changes in the computer software. But
about 70% of scans done in Rhode Island discover a medical
problem -- the same rate of positive findings that he would
expect at a top university hospital.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SIXTY-NINE PERCENT of chief executives believe high costs
and limited access to high-tech equipment will create a
"two-tier medical care system, one for the rich and one for
the poor," according to responses from 736 CEOs to a survey
by William M. Mercer Inc., employee benefit consultants. . .
. In Newark, N.J., the Prudential Foundation puts up $65,000
to support a van staffed by medical personnel that will make
house calls to children in housing projects.
