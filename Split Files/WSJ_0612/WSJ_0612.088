   NEW YORK -- After four days of declines from record highs,
stock prices rebounded, but only on meager volume, as some
investors ventured into blue chips to put idle cash back to
work.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.19 to close at
2892.57.

   Bond prices wound up only slightly lower than Friday's
level in light trading, despite an early morning decline led
by foreign selling. The dollar continued to hold its own,
largely because of weakness in other currencies.
   Activity in the stock and bond markets was muted in
anticipation of crucial inflation indicators to be released
this week. The producer price index is due Thursday and the
consumer price index Friday. Investors will be looking for
confirmation that inflation isn't nearly as bad as the
numbers earlier this year indicated.
   Lower inflation is good news for stock prices because
subdued inflation can help company profits. Bond prices also
benefit.
   Meanwhile, both small and large investors seem to have
taken last week's decline as a chance to move more cash into
the stock market. But the market remains troublesome for some
investors.
   "We had a pullback last week, and now it's off to the
races again," said Frank A. Cappiello Jr., president of San
Francisco-based money manager McCullough, Andrews &amp;
Cappiello. Noting that trading was narrow, he said, "What
worries us is the activity seems to be mainly in blue-chip
and story stocks," or companies in unique and attractive
situations.
   Another bothersome element, Mr. Cappiello said, is the
failure of the Dow Jones Utility Average to keep pace with
the rest of the market. Yesterday, the industrial average
rose a little more than 1%, while the utilities index gained
0.76 to close at 213.22, a gain of a less than 0.4%.
   The utility average "has to start moving rapidly to a new
high," he said. "Otherwise, the rationale for this market
rise doesn't exist." Rising prices for utility stocks --
which like bonds are helped by the prospect of lower interest
rates -- tend to indicate that investors believe interest
rates are going down.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in slow trading, with 119.6 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, down
from 142.6 million Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 918-563.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased slightly. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond inched up to 8.44%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar ended mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6930 marks and 154.77 yen, compared
with 1.6975 marks and 153.49 yen late Friday.
