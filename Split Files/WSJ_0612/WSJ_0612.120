   CANADIAN PACIFIC FOREST PRODUCTS Ltd. (Toronto) -- This
forest products concern, which is 79.7%-owned by
Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd., said it closed a
private placement of US$200 million of 20-year senior notes
with U.S. institutional investors. The company said the notes
were issued in two series: $98 million of Series A notes due
June 15, 2010 and bearing interest at 10.63%; and $102
million of Series B notes at 10.5% interest, also due June
15, 2010, but with a sinking fund starting in 2001, producing
an average life of 15.5 years.
   The firm said proceeds will be used to repay debt incurred
to finance its capital expenditure program. Canadian Pacific
