   VALHI Inc. (Dallas) -- Moody's Investor Service Inc. said
it assigned a single-B-3 credit rating to the proposed
convertible subordinated debentures, due 2015, of this
holding company. It also confirmed its single-B-2 rating for
Valhi's 12.5% senior subordinated notes, due 1998. In a
related action, it raised the rating on NL Industries Inc.'s
sinking fund debentures to single-B-1 from single-B-2. Valhi
owns 66% of NL Industries. About $467 million of long-term
debt is affected. The rating concern said its assessment of
Valhi's proposed debentures included the issue's junior
subordinated position and the superior position of hefty debt
at the operating subsidiary level. In upgrading NL
Industries' sinking fund debentures, it cited the company's
good operating performance and strong market position,
especially in its production of titanium oxide.
