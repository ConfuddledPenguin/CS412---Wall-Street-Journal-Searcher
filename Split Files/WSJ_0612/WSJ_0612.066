   RENO, Nev. -- The U.S. sales arm of Porsche AG said it is
recalling 19 of its 928 S4 and 928 GT models because of a
defect that could cause fuel leaks and, potentially, fires.
   Porsche said the fuel tanks of the affected models are
attached to the car with a mounting nut that could crack. As
a result, fuel could leak from the tank. If the gasoline
comes in contact with a hot exhaust system, a fire might
occur. The auto maker said it isn't aware of any fires,
accidents or injuries caused by the defect.
