   If everything had gone as planned, the $58 billion
California Public Employees Retirement System would soon hire
its first outside minority and women-owned investment firms
to manage money for the nation's largest public pension fund.
   But instead of providing a boost for women and minority
groups in the investment business, the most extensive hunt of
its kind ever conducted by a pension fund turned into a
bureaucratic embarrassment.

   The reason: Among the 85 "emerging" money managers found
qualified in the California fund's search, all the
black-owned firms were eliminated in the selection of the 29
finalists.
   Following an uproar, the 13-member board of trustees of
the fund, known as Calpers, voted unanimously yesterday to
reverse its choice of the 29 finalists, according to Richard
Koppes, Calpers general counsel. Instead, the trustees will
interview all 85 money managers previously found qualified by
Calpers consultants. That includes four black-owned firms.
   "We stumbled badly," Charles P. Valdez, a trustee of
Calpers and chairman of its powerful investment committee,
said, referring to the initial lack of black-owned firms
among the finalists. "I don't know what else to do, {except}
to hold my head in shame."
   Speaking at a conference in Chicago last week of minority
and women money managers, sponsored by the National
Association of Securities Professionals, Mr. Valdez
criticized members of the Calpers staff for "skewing" the
manager search so that black candidates were eliminated.
   The episode comes as public and corporate pension funds --
the nation's biggest pool of investment capital with $2.6
trillion -- seek to reach beyond the traditional white,
male-dominated investment establishment to obtain
money-management services.
   Pension funds nationwide, especially those with a large
number of women and minority-group participants, are paying
greater attention today to the makeup of money-management
firms they hire. The trend is particularly strong in
California, where public utilities, for example, are required
to buy 15% of their products and services, including
investment services, from minority-owned firms.
   Some pension funds have avoided the pitfalls that tripped
up Calpers. Calpers' sister fund, the $30 billion California
State Teachers Retirement System, didn't have any trouble
finding three black-owned money-management firms among 12
finalists in a similar hunt it is conducting.
   The lack of black finalists caused an uproar among Calpers
trustees and minority-group managers, because, while the
number of black-owned investment firms is small, a few have
gained excellent reputations and have been hired by other
public and corporate pension funds.
   Calpers trustees haven't said how much money they plan to
allot to women and minority-group managers, but as much as $1
billion could be at stake.
   "The fact we're not a finalist doesn't necessarily mean it
was a bad search, but the fact that no black firm made the
finals is distressing," said Maceo K. Sloan, president of
Durham, N.C.-based NCM Capital Management Group Inc., one of
the biggest black-owned investment firms.
   Calpers began its search last year by hiring two
consultants -- one women-owned firm, the other black-owned --
to solicit candidates. While the intent was to hire an
unspecified number of minority-group and women money
managers, Calpers lawyers became concerned that such a
limited search would run afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's
Richmond decision, which limits the use of racial quotas in
hiring. As a result, the Calpers search was opened to
"emerging" money managers, those with assets under management
of between $20 million and $500 million.
   The consultants, following guidelines from the Calpers
staff, ranked the 85 qualified firms to obtain 29 finalists.
Of those, five firms are owned by women, four by Hispanics,
and one by a disabled manager; the remainder of the finalist
firms are owned by white men who qualify as "emerging,"
because their money-management firms are still small.
   But Mr. Valdez complained that the search was flawed. For
example, he said some minority-group firms were penalized in
the rankings because they were growing too fast. Pension
funds sometimes shy away from hiring fast-growing money
managers because investment performance can decline as firms
get bigger. But Mr. Valdez said Calpers' staff was too rigid
in applying such rules when the intent of the search was to
find black money managers.
   "It's an attitude and an engrained rule problem," Mr.
Valdez said of the Calpers staff. He said that in future
efforts to hire minority-group and women managers, "I think
we have to be {more} direct in our efforts, because an
indirect effort . . . did not work."
   Mr. Koppes, the Calpers general counsel, said the decision
to interview all 85 candidates was viewed by the trustees as
the simplest solution to salvaging the search. He said the
board didn't resolve who was to blame for the lack of black
finalists.
   Even though each candidate has less than 45 minutes to
make his or her presentation, the expanded interviewing could
take months to be completed by the Calpers board members,
most of whom have other full-time jobs.
   Meanwhile, the California teachers pension fund is
scheduled to interview its 12 minority-group and women
manager finalists next week, and could reach a hiring
decision later this month.
