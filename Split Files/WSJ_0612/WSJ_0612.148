   GALVESTON, Texas -- Burning oil forced firefighters to
postpone plans to use foam against the blaze aboard the Mega
Borg, whose stern slipped under water late yesterday,
slightly increasing chances it would sink.
   Smit International, the largest maritime firefighting
outfit in the world, had ordered up special state-of-the-art
equipment from its Rotterdam headquarters in the Netherlands
to apply the foam that deprives fires of oxygen. But burning
oil belched from the Norwegian tanker, forcing fireboats
back.

   In addition, Smit officials worried that the ship's metal
was still too hot to guarantee foam would be successful. They
planned to attempt to apply foam again this morning.
   Meanwhile, Coast Guard officials insisted that chances
remain slim that the Mega Borg and its 38.2 million gallons
of crude oil will sink.
   "There's a risk," said Coast Guard Petty Officer Gene
Maestas, "but I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming concern at
this time." Todd Nelson, another Coast Guard petty officer,
said the Mega Borg is highly compartmentalized and that even
though the stern has slipped under water, "lots of airtight
compartments are keeping the boat afloat." An estimated
100,000 gallons of oil have spilled from the tanker since
fire and explosions ripped through its pump room in the early
morning hours of Saturday.
   The oil tanker disaster 57 miles southeast of this port
city has much of the Gulf of Mexico on alert.
   Local, state and federal authorities that set up command
posts here are contending with the problems of putting out
the fire and being prepared should the Norwegian ship spill
more crude.
   Even the possibility of a major oil spill -- the Exxon
Valdez spilled less than a third as much crude as the Mega
Borg is carrying -- put emergency plans into immediate high
gear. The Coast Guard, in addition to local personnel, called
in its Atlantic Area Strike Team from Mobile, Ala., to serve
as technical advisers, and has Coast Guard cutters and
skimmers on the scene.
   The Environmental Protection Agency -- even though it had
some doubts -- approved the use of dispersants almost
immediately. "We don't like to" use dispersants, said EPA
spokesman Roger Meacham, "because of the danger to marine
life. But we want to make sure this oil is broken up as
quickly as possible." Coast Guard Admiral William Kime said
the dispersants will help the oil evaporate faster. About
half of the spilled oil is expected to evaporate, he said,
because it is a light crude and the weather is favorable. The
Valdez spilled heavy, Alaskan oil into icy waters.
   Industry observers as well as the government officials
themselves said it was obvious that many people were trying
to respond as quickly as possible to the Mega Borg emergency
in order to avoid the accusations of slow action and decison
making that came out of the Valdez incident.
   "The response was nearly immediate," Mr. Meacham said. "We
called the major players to Galveston to get the situation
under control." Other federal agencies such as the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service have been consulted.
   The Texas Water Commission, which has jurisdiction over
oil spills in the state, said it has materials ready in case
there is a major oil spill that hits shore. Buck Wynne,
chairman of the commission, said: "It's not going to stay in
one place."
   In fact, oceanographers at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration say the Mega Borg's oil could
pollute 200 miles of beaches from Corpus Christi north. Jim
Conn of the Corpus Christi area oil spill control association
said the association is ready to set out booms to protect
beaches and inlets between barrier islands and the coast. "We
haven't done anything other than monitoring at this time," he
said, adding: "We're the fourth-largest oil port in the U.S.
and so we have a large exposure to oil spills. We clean about
40 small oil spills a year."
   Galveston already has activated its Emergency Operations
Center. "We've basically got the same people down here that
we have here for hurricanes," said Gary Stone, a city
spokesman."We get people from all different departments in to
help answer phones and monitor activities." The Beach Parks
Board has two people checking the beaches every two hours to
report if any oil is washed up.
   Gary Clark, president of the Houston Audubon Society, said
the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and Matagorda Island,
both north of Corpus Christi, are especially vulnerable right
now. "This is one of the worst times to have (a spill),
because the waterbirds are breeding," he said. "We have
chicks coming out of the eggs."
   If a major spill occurs, Mr. Clark sees devastating
effects on two endangered species -- the brown pelican and
the Ridley Sea Turtle. The brown pelican is making a comeback
after its population was decimated by DDT. Now, there are at
most "20 birds, a very fragile population," Mr. Clark said.
Because light crude is more toxic than what was spilled in
Alaska, "they wouldn't be oiled birds, they would be dead
birds."
