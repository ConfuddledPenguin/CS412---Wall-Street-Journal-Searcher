   NEW YORK -- Scattered bargain hunting revived
over-the-counter stocks from the sluggishness that overtook
them late last week. But traders were wary about reading much
into the day's gains.
   The session was marked, rather, by a plunge in one of the
market's high technology stocks, reminding OTC stock watchers
that some share prices may yet be too high.

   Microcom lost nearly half of its value after announcing
late Friday that it expects to lose 15 cents to 20 cents a
share in its fiscal first quarter ending June 30. It blamed
the loss on "overstocking" of Microcom products by some of
its domestic distributors and a subsequent slump in sales.
   The Norwood, Mass.-based computer communications equipment
maker earned 29 cents a share in the quarter last year, and
some analysts had expected it to do better in the current
quarter.
   "People are very aggressive about unloading stocks of
companies that come in with a disappointment," said William
R. Rothe, managing director of OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons.
   By the session's end, investors had dumped more than 1.7
million Microcom shares, driving the price down 8 1/2 to 9
3/4.
   While many market players are counting on improving
earnings to support the recent gain in stock prices,
occasional casualties like Microcom offer a chilling reminder
of what can happen when expected earnings don't come through.
   Meanwhile, the broader OTC market drifted higher on
shrinking volume. Only 85.4 million National Market System
shares changed hands, compared with 101.8 million shares on
Friday.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which fell about 1 1/2 points
shortly after the opening, closed with a 1.92 point gain, up
0.42% to 462.79. OTC advancers edged out decliners, 923 to
898.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose about
0.7%.
   Alex. Brown's Mr. Rothe says that money managers with too
much cash in their portfolios remain under pressure to put
that money in stocks before the quarter ends. He says many
late buyers who missed May's rally are arguing that corporate
profits should start showing quarter-over-quarter gains later
this year.
   But few were drawing conclusions from yesterday's
activity.
   "I don't think it means anything," says Lance Zipper,
manager of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. "The volume is just
too light."
   Mr. Zipper says most players are likely to wait for this
week's storm of economic data to pass before venturing back
into unlisted stocks.
   May's retail sales figures will be released tomorrow,
while the producer price index and consumer price index are
due later in the week. Expiring options and futures contracts
add a further element of uncertainty to the end of the week.
   Despite Microcom's debacle, other OTC technology stocks
gained. Apple Computer rose 3/4 to 39, Microsoft gained 1 3/8
to 74 7/8, and Seagate Technology added 1/4 to 15 1/2.
   National Savings Bank of Albany jumped 1 1/2 to 32 1/2.
The company said it has received a proposal for yet another
business combination. The stock slumped after an earlier
merger agreement with Home &amp; City Savings was terminated at
the end of May.
   Amgen rose 1 to 70 1/2. The biotechnology company is
coming under pressure from federal government officials who
contend that Medicare is paying too high a price for the
company's anti-anemia drug, erythropoetin, or EPO, the New
York Times reported.
   Greenery Rehabilitation Group fell 1 1/4 to 13 3/8. On
Friday, the company said it filed with the SEC to offer 2
million common shares. It said 1.5 million shares are being
offered by Gerard M. Martin, chairman and chief executive
officer, while 500,000 shares are being sold by the company.
   Showbiz Pizza Time hit a new 52-week high in heavy
trading, adding 2 to 28 1/4. The company says it can't
explain the rise, however. The company operates a system of
259 Showbiz Pizza Palace and Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants in
22 states in addition to 26 Monterey's Tex-Mex Cafe
restaurants in Texas and Oklahoma.
   Genlyte Group lost 1 to 8 after announcing that its second
quarter could be as much as 50% lower than the 26 cents a
share earned in the year-earlier quarter.
   Summit Technology gained 1 3/4 to 14 3/4. The company has
begun clinical trials in Japan for its photorefractive
keratectomy and superficial keratectomy procedures used to
treat vision disorders. The company said trials are underway
in nine countries including the U.S.
   Trak Auto ended 1/2 point ahead at 9 1/4 after reporting
earnings of 16 cents a share in its latest first quarter
ended April 30, compared with five cents a year earlier.
