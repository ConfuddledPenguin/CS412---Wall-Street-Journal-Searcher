   NEC Corp. has developed a new siliconwafer etching
technology, taking a crucial step toward mass production of
64 megabit dynamic random access memory chips, the company
announced.
   The latest semiconductors to be mass produced are 4
megabit chips while 16-megabit chips are still in the
experimental stage.

   A NEC spokesman said the new technology, called Super-ECR
Plasma Etching, makes it possible to quickly etch the tightly
packed, complicated structures necessary for the
next-generation chip.
   The spokesman said the new technology will first be
applied to the production of 16-megabit chips.
   NEC's newly developed technology, using plasma over the
silicon wafer, makes it possible to etch electric circuits at
high speed.
   Compared with previously developed plasma etching methods,
the new technology is faster, finer and causes less damage to
adjoining layers of wafer membrane, the spokesman said.
