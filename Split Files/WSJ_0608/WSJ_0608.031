   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association's proposed junk-bond
sale are boosting the chances that the controversial
transaction will be completed and possibly offer a model for
helping the government out of its growing junk-bond woes,
according to sources familiar with the plan.
   As previously reported, Columbia is offering to finance
between 85% and 90% of the purchase price for its portfolio,
which has a current market value of about $2.9 billion. But
the key element of the plan, being outlined to potential
bidders in documents being sent as early as today, is an
offer, apparently cleared at least tentatively by regulators,
to finance the sale on a nonrecourse basis, according to
people close to the company.

   Such nonrecourse financing would greatly limit any buyer's
risk of loss from the deal. In essence, if the buyer were to
default on a note for the balance of the purchase price, the
buyer would only risk losing the cash downpayment, and
Columbia would again be stuck with the bonds. The note,
backed by the bonds, would also carry a double-digit interest
rate to cover Columbia's high-cost deposit base, the sources
said.
   Another attraction of the deal, the sources said, is that
any buyer would have some latitude in selling the bonds and
replacing them with other collateral for the note, offering a
chance to take advantage of price changes for individual
issues.
   The terms appear to have ignited some interest in the
transaction, code-named the Big Lift, which many analysts had
seriously doubted would ever get off the ground.
   "I think what regulators and Columbia have come up with is
ingenious," said one of the bidders, who requested anonymity.
   Added another person close to Columbia who is familiar
with the bidding process, "I think people are putting real
bids on the table. Nobody has taken the process fallaciously
in any way, and I know one bidder, an institution that is
extremely well-run and does not do wheel spins, and they have
spent unbelievable amounts of man hours on this."
   This person added, however, "It is hard to put a
probability on it. Whenever the government has the final say,
they can act very far outside the rationale of what normal
finance people do. It is a very political thing too."
   At least a half dozen bidders are still interested in the
portfolio, Columbia officials said, although they declined to
name them.
   By itself, a sale at even book value wouldn't save
Columbia, which is deeply insolvent because of more than $1
billion in losses and write-downs on its junk bonds in recent
months. Indeed, some analysts consider it probable that even
if the sale is completed, Columbia will still be taken over
by regulators.
   The takeover is likely to occur in order to facilitate the
sale of the thrift's $2 billion-deposit, 22-branch retail
system. Columbia has roughly $5 billion in additional
brokered deposits paying above-market rates, and that is
considered an impediment to any purchaser of the branch
system. A federal takeover would allow the purchaser to reset
interest rates on those deposits at more competitive rates.
   Nonetheless, the structure proposed for the sale would
help minimize losses for Columbia and could also be of some
use in helping the federal Resolution Trust Corp. unload its
estimated $4 billion junk-bond portfolio acquired through
seizure of various thrifts. To date, analysts believe the RTC
has sold only about $100 million of bonds, and critics
contend the agency hasn't devised a strategy for disposing of
the rest.
   "If we are successful, it clearly points out an
alternative for the regulators for liquidation of their
portfolios," said Columbia's president and chief executive
officer, Edward G. Harshfield, in an interview. "It also
clearly points out an alternative way to handle the bonds
before the regulators actually move from conservatorship to a
receivership situation."
   Mr. Harshfield reiterated his optimism about prospects for
a sale of Columbia's portfolio. "I was hopeful before, and I
am more hopeful now," he said. "The process has reconfirmed
that there is a real transaction here to be done. The only
question that remains is at what price." He said the company
is looking to accept bids later this month.
   In Washington, a spokesman for the RTC said the agency is
"looking at a lot of different ways of selling our assets."
   Some analysts criticized the proposed structure because
the nonrecourse financing would still leave Columbia -- or
the government in the event of a takeover -- vulnerable if
the bonds sank greatly in value.
   Others said political pressures could still confound the
sale. Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., has been a
main target of thrift-industry reformers, who have been
critical of its junk-bond investing and former chief
executive Thomas A. Spiegel's close ties to former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond guru Michael Milken. Mr.
Harshfield, a former Citicorp and Household International
Inc. executive who was brought in with the approval of
regulators in March, has been increasingly openly critical of
prior management, a move that some perceive as a way of
defusing the political storm about Columbia's future.
   When asked whether the government is supporting his
efforts, Mr. Harshfield said, "I think that speaks for
itself. As a practical matter, we are in a negative $215
million capital position, and we are not in a
conservatorship. You have to ask what do we have going for us
here. We have only two things: the potential of doing a bond
transaction and a management here now that is running the
place as well as its predecessor and probably better."
