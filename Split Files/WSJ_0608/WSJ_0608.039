   ("Approximately one in every 360 citizens of the United
States is a lawyer." -- News item)
                                                                                                       

   No wonder lawyers are independent
   And, indeed, often show defiance --
   Since each has, approximately,
   Three hundred and fifty-nine clients.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   This is an affluent country. Where else would letters
offering thousands of dollars in credit or millions of
dollars in prizes be called "junk mail"?
