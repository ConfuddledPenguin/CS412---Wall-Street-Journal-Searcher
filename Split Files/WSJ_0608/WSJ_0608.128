   NEW YORK -- New York state drew strong investor demand for
$4.1 billion of short-term notes at its long-awaited spring
borrowing.
   An official at lead underwriter Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. said the offering was oversubscribed and that yields
were lowered from original levels.

   "We have orders for about $5.5 billion, with a good degree
of institutional participation as well as retail," said Frank
Murphy, senior vice president and head of the short-term
municipal desk at Shearson.
   The spring borrowing -- traditionally the largest bond
offering each year in most states -- was priced early to
6.15%. But later in the day, yields on the nine-month notes
were cut to 6.10%. The notes, which are used to finance the
state's huge accumulated deficit, mature on March 28, 1991.
   The yield on the notes was lower than the 6.20% to 6.35%
that had been talked about earlier this week.
   The thinking had been that the state couldn't sell the
spring borrowing at a lower rate than 6.20%, given that
credit rating agencies recently downgraded the state's credit
rating.
   The tax and revenue anticipation notes, which were priced
by a group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., was rated
MIG-2, the second-highest short-term municipal rating from
Moody's Investors Service. Last year's spring borrowing
carried top ratings.
   Late Wednesday, underwriting officials had agreed that the
deal should be priced to yield 6.20%, but the yield was
lowered when New York State Comptroller Edward Regan said he
wanted a lower rate, according to underwriting officials at
several members of the selling group.
   "We negotiated aggressively," said Bob Hinckley, a
spokesman for Mr. Regan when asked if the comptroller had
urged that underwriting officials offer the notes at the
lower yield level. The 0.10 percentage point reduction from
estimates will save the state about $3 million in interest
costs over the life of the notes.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds were unchanged to 1/8 point higher after
prices inched up in response to news that consumer credit
expanded much less than expected in April.
   The Federal Reserve reported that consumer credit grew
$584 million in April, much lower than expected.
   Trading was extremely quiet yesterday.
   The benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 1/8 point, or
$1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,
fell to 8.42% from 8.44%.
   The price of the benchmark bond was quoted late at 103
14/32, up from 103 9/ 32.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Investors continued to bid up junk bond prices.
   Most junk bonds, speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, climbed between
1/4 point and 1/2 point.
   Traders said that bonds from Duracell Holdings Corp.,
Kroger Co. and American Standard Inc. were among the
so-called high-quality junk bond names that advanced
yesterday.
   Duracell Holdings' 13.50% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2000, were bid for at 104, up 1/2 point from
Wednesday, while Kroger's 13 1/8% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2001, closed at 104, also up 1/2 point.
   Junk bonds of Trump Taj Mahal Funding slipped after news
that the number of employees at the Trump Taj Mahal gambling
resort is expected to decline to 6,200 from 7,100.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding's 14% bonds, maturing in 1998,
closed at their session lows, sliding 3/4 point to 56 1/2.
The bonds had traded as high as 59 earlier in the session.
   By comparison, bonds of Trump Plaza Funding and Trump
Castle Funding showed little change.
   In the investment-grade debt market, actively traded
corporate issues were unchanged to slightly higher.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Retracing marginal gains posted earlier in the session,
municipals ended flat to 1/8 point higher in lackluster
dealings.
   Aside from the $4.1 billion New York state issue, trading
among secondary issues was slim.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged, at 98 5/8 to yield
7.32%.
   No large municipal issues are expected to be priced today.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A growing number of Japanese corporations are tapping the
commercial-paper market, or short-term corporate IOUs, a
trend that is expected to continue as other methods of
financing become scarce.
   Analysts estimate that outstanding commercial paper at the
end of April, the most recent figures available, totaled 15
trillion yen ($98.33 billion), up two trillion yen from
March. Japan's Finance Ministry first allowed companies to
issue commercial paper in November 1987.
   But the growth of new issuance was slow until the Tokyo
stock market dropped sharply earlier this year. Since then,
stock and equity-linked debt offerings have nearly
disappeared. Tighter restrictions on lending have made it
more difficult for companies to get bank loans. As a result,
more companies are turning to the commercial-paper market.
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the third-largest Japanese auto
maker, for example, obtained a commercial-paper rating at the
end of May that will allow it to issue as much as 200 billion
yen of paper.
   Shinichi Korechika, assistant manager of the planning and
funding group of Mitsubishi's finance department, said his
company has never issued commercial paper in the past, but
plans to in the near future.
   Officials at Japanese rating agencies said there has been
a rise in companies obtaining commercial-paper credit
ratings. The Japanese government will soon require all
companies that sell commercial paper to first obtain a credit
rating. Nippon Investors Service said it rated 41 companies
for commercial paper, including 15 since late March.
   In trading yesterday, Japanese government bonds ended
weaker on growing speculation that short-term interest rates
will keep their present high level. Japan's benchmark 10-year
issue ended at 87.97, down 0.07 point, to yield 6.975%. (The
yield is calculated in local terms, but would be lower if
calculated by the semiannual compound measure that is used in
the U.S.)
   In Britain, bond prices were buoyed by a rise in the pound
and a business survey pointing to moderate retail-sales
growth in May. Among benchmarks, Britain's 11.75% bond due
2003/2007 rose 10/32 to 100 1/2 to yield 11.68%.
   West German government bonds ended as much as 1/2 point
lower, pressured by technical trading in the futures pit.
Traders in the cash market said that while prices fell,
trading activity was very thin. Bonn's 8.75% bonds due in
2000 were quoted late at 99.60 to yield 8.82%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities crept up in response
to small gains in U.S. Treasurys.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for June delivery advanced 1/32 to 99 10/32.
   In other mortgage sectors, Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. 9.5% securities were up 1/32 at 98 22/32; 10%
securities were 2/32 firmer at 100 19/32. Federal National
Mortgage Association 9.5% securities rose 1/32 to 99 6/32;
10% securities firmed 2/32 to 101 1/8.
