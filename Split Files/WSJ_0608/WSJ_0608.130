   Pilkington PLC said its pretax profit for the year to
March 31 fell 3.4%, as higher interest costs and reduced
investment income offset a slight gain in its big glassmaking
business.
   Pretax profit was #314 million ($186.1 million), down from
#325 million a year earlier. Profit after taxes dropped 7.6%
to #186 million from #201 million, while earnings per share
eased 8.4% to 25 pence from 27.3 pence.

   Net profit attributable to shareholders managed a slim
1.2% rise to #179 million from #176 million. The group took
an extraordinary charge of #6.9 million, chiefly the result
of a provision against the effect of hyperinflation on its
Argentinian operations. The charge was down from the #24.4
million extraordinary loss a year earlier.
   Chairman Antony Pilkington said the "economic climate in a
number of the markets in which the group operates is more
uncertain today than has been the case for some time."
However, the group said it would still recommend a final
dividend of 7.57 pence a share that would increase the total
payout for the year to 10.5 pence from 9.5 pence.
