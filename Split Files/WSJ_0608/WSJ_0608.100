   DALLAS -- Chili's Inc. said it has called for redemption
July 6 its $35 million of 6.25% convertible subordinated
debentures due 2012 at a price of $1,057.81 per $1,000 face
amount, eliminating almost all of the restaurant company's
debt.
   Chili's said the debentures are convertible until June 26
into common stock at a price of $27.67 a share, or about 36
common shares per $1,000 bond. Assuming all the debentures
are converted to common stock, Chili's will issue 1.3 million
new common shares.

   The company currently has about 10.6 million shares and
stock options outstanding. Chili's said that under an
agreement with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Goldman will purchase
any debentures that aren't converted and then will convert
its holding to common stock.
