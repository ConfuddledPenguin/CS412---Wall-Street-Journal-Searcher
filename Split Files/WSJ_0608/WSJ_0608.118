   Medtronic Inc. sweetened its stock swap proposal for
Bio-Medicus Inc., a maker of blood pumps used in surgery.
   Under the new plan, the Minneapolis-based maker of
biomedical devices is offering to exchange one Medtronic
share for 3.15 Bio-Medicus shares. Previously, it had been
proposing to swap one Medtronic share for 3.3 Bio-Medicus
shares.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Medtronic shares closed at $79.625, up 87.5 cents. Under
Medtronic's revised offer, that price would value each
Bio-Medicus share at $25.278.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Bio-Medicus shares jumped $1.375 to close at $23.125.
   Medtronic has characterized its bid as friendly, but
Bio-Medicus's board met shortly after receiving the original
bid in mid-May and took no action on the proposal. A
spokesman said that Bio-Medicus's directors will meet to
consider the new proposal. He declined further comment.
   Under a 1987 pact, Medtronic can't boost its current 5.5%
stake in the company above 10% without Bio-Medicus board
approval.
