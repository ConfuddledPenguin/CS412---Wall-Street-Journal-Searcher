   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a Houston-based
waste-management concern, said it agreed with Weyerhaeuser
Paper Co. to recycle as much as 10,000 tons of paper a month
in the Western U.S. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Under the contract, the unit of Weyerhaeuser Co., a
Tacoma, Wash., forest products company, will buy newspaper,
cardboard and office paper collected by Browning-Ferris in
its participating recycling programs in Arizona, California,
Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

   Browning-Ferris said the paper recycling program also will
extend to British Columbia, Canada. Newspapers from the
collected material will be shipped to Weyerhaeuser's Norpac
mill in Longview, Wash., which can process 500 tons of
newspaper a day.
   The company said the pact guarantees the purchase of
120,000 tons of newspaper, cardboard and high-grade office
paper a year.
