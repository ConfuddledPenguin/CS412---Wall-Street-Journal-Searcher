   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. -- General Cinema Corp. reported a
97% drop in fiscal second-quarter net income, chiefly because
of a gain in the year-earlier period from discontinued
operations.
   The operator of cinemas and specialty retailer said net
for the quarter ended April 30 fell to $29.8 million, or 40
cents a share, from $893.9 million, or $12.10 a share, in the
year-ago period.

   The latest period included a pretax gain of $587,000 on
the sale of securities. A year ago, the company had a pretax
gain of $27.1 million on the sale of securities, and had
profit of $859 million from discontinued operations, which
included $855.1 million from the disposal of operations.
Profit from continuing operations was $34.9 million, or 47
cents a share, a year ago.
   Revenue rose 20% to $642.8 million from $536.9 million.
   In the first six months, net fell 95% to $49.9 million, or
68 cents a share, from $938.3 million, or $12.71 a share, in
the year-ago period.
   The latest period included a pretax loss of $586,000 from
the sale of securities. A year ago, the company had a pretax
gain of $82.9 million from the sale of securities, and profit
from continuing operations of $72.4 million, or 98 cents a
share.
   Revenue was $1.16 billion, up 19% from $976.6 million.
   The company did not predict results for the third quarter,
but said it is unlikely its theater division's earnings will
exceed the $12.2 million earned in the past year's summer
quarter.
