   Pic 'N' Save Corp., which has waged a two-month dogfight
against takeover attempts by an investor group led by David
H. Batchelder, declared a temporary cease-fire to talk with
the group and others about a possible sale of the concern.
   Pic 'N' Save said it would postpone its annual meeting
until Aug. 15 from June 20. Meanwhile, Mr. Batchelder's
group, Girard Partners Limited Partnership, said it would
temporarily drop its proxy battle for control of Dominguez,
Calif.-based Pic 'N' Save.

   The company, which said it would accept takeover bids
until July 15, agreed with Girard that the partnership and
other potential bidders wouldn't be required to sign a
standstill pact precluding future proxy fights, as previously
stated, in order to make a bid. Pic 'N' Save, an operator of
a chain of retail stores specializing in new "close-out"
merchandise, stated that neither Girard nor Pic 'N' Save
would be allowed to solicit proxies prior to July 15.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Pic 'N' Save closed
at $12.375, down 12.5 cents, placing the market value of the
company at about $436.6 million.
   Mr. Batchelder, who said Girard hasn't as yet made any
offer and that he knows of no other bids, said he was hopeful
the agreement would negate the need for a proxy fight after
July 15.
   Pic 'N' Save's chairman and chief executive officer, Lewis
B. Merrifield III, said the pact would allow the company to
"concentrate all of our efforts on trying to maximize
shareholder value through a sale of the company and hope that
there will not be any need for further disputes with Girard."
   A news release hinted that there were other interested
parties, but a spokesman for the company declined to say if
any bids had been received.
   Girard has previously stated that if it succeeded in
efforts to gain control, it would buy the company or auction
it off to the highest bidder.
   The spat between the two concerns began when the
partnership controlled by Mr. Batchelder, a former strategist
for T. Boone Pickens, disclosed in April that it held a 6.6%
stake in Pic 'N' Save and planned to make a bid to acquire
it.
   Girard later formally asked the company for control of the
Pic 'N' Save board and launched a proxy fight to gain a
majority on the board.
   Meanwhile, Pic 'N' Save, struggling to keep control, put
itself up for sale in May and said its financial advisers
would begin calling a host of potential buyers. But it said
it would only provide non-public information to prospective
buyers who sign a confidentiality agreement with several
standstill provisions. If it wished to bid for the company,
Girard Partners would have been forced to abandon for three
years efforts to seize control of the board.
   Although Pic 'N' Save late last month offered the group
minority representation on its board and on a newly formed
committee to evaluate bids to buy the company, Girard
promptly rejected it.
   Pic 'N' Save said it would allow Girard to participate in
the auction and resume its solicitation of consents and
proxies for its board nominees after July 15, the new record
date for the annual meeting, if no bidder emerges. It also
agreed to reimburse Girard for out-of-pocket proxy fight
expenses and to drop pending litigation until after July 15.
