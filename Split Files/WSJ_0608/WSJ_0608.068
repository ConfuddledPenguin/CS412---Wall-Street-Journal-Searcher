   LOS ANGELES -- A manufacturer of parts for microwave
systems has sued Teledyne Inc. for allegedly ruining its
business by buying exclusive rights to certain technology and
then not using it.
   H-U Development Corp., in a complaint filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court, claimed that under a 1989 agreement Los
Angeles-based Teledyne was to pay royalties for use of H-U's
"magnetic switching" technology in new microwave systems that
Teledyne produced. H-U is based in Santa Monica, Calif.

   A Teledyne spokesman said he hadn't seen the complaint and
declined comment.
   Teledyne, a manufacturing and insurance concern, also
acquired most of H-U's equipment and moved it to San Jose,
Calif., where its microwave division is located, the
complaint said.
   After that, the complaint said, Teledyne didn't allocate
production facilities to the new products, quoted
"ridiculously high" prices and long delivery periods to
potential customers, and continued producing its old systems
without the H-U technology.
   The complaint seeks at least $10 million in compensatory
damages and treble punitive damages.
