FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)
EXECUTIVE (EXE)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Manuel Johnson, influential vice chairman of
the Federal Reserve, announced he will leave the Fed when his
term expires Aug. 3 to return to academia.
   Mr. Johnson, who has served in government for the past 10
years, will become the Koch Professor of International
Economics and will serve as director of the new Center for
Global Market Studies at George Mason University in Fairfax,
Va.

   In addition, he will become co-chairman of a new
commission called the G-7 Council, which will be a private
sounding board for ideas on improving the management of the
global economy.
   President Bush was prepared to renominate Mr. Johnson to
the vice chairman's post, according to administration
officials. Mr. Johnson's decision to leave partly reflects a
calculation that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will be
reappointed to the top Fed post when his term expires next
year, in which case it would be at least five years before
Mr. Johnson would have a shot at becoming chairman.
   Moreover, even if Mr. Greenspan does leave next year, Mr.
Johnson's recent scraps with the Bush Treasury Department
might prevent him from getting the president's nod for the
top post. On a number of occasions, he has criticized efforts
by the department to intervene in exchange markets to drive
down the value of the dollar.
   Mr. Johnson, who has children aged eight and 12, also will
be able to earn considerably more money in his new jobs. The
posts at George Mason, which is a privately endowed chair,
will pay $120,000 a year, compared with the $89,000 he earns
at the Fed. In addition, Mr. Johnson said he will receive "a
modest salary" as co-chairman of the G-7 Council. And he will
be able to collect speaking fees, which he cannot as Fed vice
chairman.
   In an interview, Mr. Johnson said money wasn't the main
reason for his departure, but added: "Anybody who serves 10
years in government has to make a financial sacrifice."
   Mr. Johnson has close ties to the Bush administration, and
particularly to Secretary of State James Baker, so it's
unlikely his departure came as a surprise to the White House.
Nevertheless, the Fed vice chairman didn't give official
notice of his departure until yesterday.
   Since joining the Fed in 1986, Mr. Johnson has tended to
favor looser monetary policies than the majority of his
colleagues. Lately, however, he has been a leading voice
against further cuts in short-term interest rates.
   In searching for a replacement to Mr. Johnson, the Bush
administration is likely to look for someone who shares its
belief that the Greenspan Fed has tended to be too quick to
tighten its policies, and too slow to ease.
   President Bush's only appointee to the seven-member Fed
board so far has been David Mullins, former assistant
Treasury secretary. It's possible Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady will suggest Mr. Mullins for the No. 2 spot. But
because Mr. Mullins is new at the Fed, his elevation could
cause resentment among more experienced Fed governors and
might be opposed by Chairman Greenspan. Moreover, if the
administration makes Mr. Mullins vice chairman, it still will
have to find another person to fill the vacant Fed seat.
   As a result, the White House may be more likely to look
outside the Fed for a vice chairman. One person who has been
mentioned is economist John Taylor, a member of President
Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Taylor is scheduled
to return to his teaching job at Stanford University next
year. But he might be persuaded to stay and take the vice
chairman's post.
   The administration will have to move quickly if it wants
to have a new vice chairman chosen and confirmed by the
Senate before Mr. Johnson leaves Aug. 3.
   Mr. Johnson began his career in government in the Reagan
Treasury Department, where he was a fervent "supply-sider"
advocating tax cuts. Unlike other supply-siders, however, he
became noted for his diplomatic skills, which enabled him to
work closely with such disparate personalities as former
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, former Treasury Secretary
Baker, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Mr. Greenspan.
   Mr. Greenspan issued a statement saying, "I deeply regret
but understand" Mr. Johnson's decision. "The vice chairman
and I have been an effective team. I'll miss him."
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, said: "We have a very high regard for Vice
Chairman Johnson, and greatly appreciate the service he has
rendered."
   Mr. Johnson will co-chair the G-7 Council with Washington
consultant David Smick. The group, which initially will be
set up for 30 months, will include a broad range of academics
and former government officials such as former Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, according to Mr. Smick. It will be
an independent, non-partisan group, financed largely by
foundations. It will support the efforts of the "Group of
Seven," which consists of the finance ministers and central
bankers of the seven leading industrial nations.
   "We want to see if we can't develop useful options for the
official G-7," Mr. Johnson said.
   In recent months, Mr. Johnson has been a critic of the G-7
coordination process, arguing that it has lacked energy and
purpose. In the interview, he said that events such as the
"explosion in Eastern Europe and the unification of Germany"
make the need for economic coordination among the seven
nations greater than ever.
   The G-7 nations are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
