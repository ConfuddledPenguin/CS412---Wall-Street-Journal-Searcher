   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. said it will call a special
shareholders meeting in early August at the request of
William F. Farah, the company's former chairman.
   Mr. Farah, who owns roughly 15% of the apparel maker's
stock, requested the meeting so that he can try to remove at
least six of Farah's nine directors and replace them with his
own nominees.

   Mr. Farah, 70 years old, who retired as Farah chief
executive last July, was removed as company chairman in April
in a dispute with other board members. Thomas G. Wyman, a
company director, was named chairman.
   Mr. Farah, who remains a director of the company his
father founded, has said he would like Mr. Wyman to remain a
director, but Mr. Wyman says he wouldn't serve on Mr. Farah's
board. Mr. Farah also said he would retain Charles C. Wood as
a director.
   The company said in April that Mr. Farah had asked
directors to either remove current management or to resign as
directors, and they refused. Farah said that all of its
directors except Mr. Wood advised Mr. Farah at a board
meeting last week that his actions aren't in shareholders'
best interests and could hurt the company.
   Mr. Farah also has sued the company in El Paso county
court.
   In an interview, Mr. Wyman said that several decisions
that Mr. Farah made during his tenure, including a temporary
move to sell apparel to discounters and a failure to maintain
quality control at new foreign production plants, have
contributed to Farah's operating losses.
   For the six months ended April 30, Farah had a net loss of
$2 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $59.9 million.
