   Profit-taking pushed the over-the-counter market lower,
but traders said sellers displayed little conviction while
buyers were ready to absorb shares as prices fell.
   "Stocks are coming down, but not hard," said Jerry
Markowitz, partner in charge of OTC trading at Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. "I think it will run its course
within a day or two."

   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.87, or 0.19%, to 464.09.
By contrast, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell
0.47%.
   Some telecommunications stocks fared better. The Nasdaq
Utility Index, which is heavily weighted with the group, rose
0.52 to 669.33. Tele-Communications Class A, one of the
biggest stocks in the group by value of its outstanding
shares, rose 3/8 to 15 3/4.
   Overall, advancing OTC issues trailed decliners, 957 to
989. Volume eased to 151 million shares from 156.5 million
Wednesday.
   "They're getting a little tired," remarked Robert O'Toole
Sr., head of OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, of
bullish investors. "But, I don't think they're dead. There
are bids all the way down with these stocks."
   Program selling in exchange-listed issues drove the OTC
market lower too, explained Richard Bruno, head of OTC
trading for PaineWebber. "There's definitely a connection
between program trading and the OTC market," he said. Among
large investors, Mr. Bruno said he saw more institutions
willing to sell shares than he has in several weeks. He
added, however, that he doesn't think the market is changing
course, but is "just taking a breather."
   Two relatively new issues suffered in yesterday's market.
Shares of Urcarco, a Dallas retailer of used cars and trucks,
fell 1 3/4 to 17 in heavy trading. The company went public
May 31 with an initial offering of five million common shares
priced at $19.875 each.
   Urcarco said it is in discussions with its lead bank, NCNB
Texas National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp., to "significantly
increase" its revolving credit line, and with investment
bankers to consider securitizing its automobile note
portfolio and sell commercial paper.
   Pharmacy Management Services, which tumbled yesterday amid
analysts' concerns about earnings, extended its slide. Shares
of the drug development company fell 2 1/2 to 13 5/8.
Pharmacy Management went public April 4 at $12 a share and
rose as high as 18 1/2 last month.
   MCI Communications was unchanged at 42. Wednesday, a
federal appeals court panel overturned a Federal
Communications Commission decision allowing the competing
Bell companies to combine their regulated and unregulated
subsidiaries. MCI, which had appealed the regulators'
decision, was "delighted" with the court decision, a
spokesman said. Also yesterday, the Washington, D.C.,
long-distance carrier said it will begin a joint marketing
program with Hotelcopy Inc. allowing MCI to compete in the
hotel industry with its FaxMail network.
   Adobe Systems, one of yesterday's few strong technology
issues, rose 2 to 35 3/4 after the Mountain View, Calif.,
software maker announced another licensing pact with a blue
chip company. Adobe reached an agreement with Eastman Kodak
Co. giving Kodak licensing rights to the company's PostScript
software technology. Wednesday, Adobe announced a similar
agreement with Xerox.
   InterVoice added 1 to 19 1/4. Although the Dallas maker of
telephone voice-response systems said late Wednesday that its
first-quarter earnings outlook is weak, the company's board
also approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of
its 5.6 million outstanding common stock. InterVoice said
that revenue of $4.88 million in the first fiscal quarter
ended May 31 are below expectations and will pressure
quarterly income, due for release later this month. The
company reported net income of $1.1 million, or 27 cents a
share, on revenue of nearly $5 million in the year-earlier
quarter.
   Intel slid 7/8 to 46 7/8. The Santa Clara, Calif.,
electronic equipment maker said it plans to build a
$300-million manufacturing plant in Dublin with the support
of the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland. Among
other weak technology issues, Apple Computer slipped 1/2 to
39; Microsoft fell 1 to 72, and Oracle Systems dropped 1/2 to
20 5/8. Sun Microsystems rose 3/8 to 31 3/8.
   Weak earnings outlooks hurt several stocks. Orthomet
plunged 2 3/8 to 9 after the Minneapolis maker of orthopedic
products said late yesterday that earnings for the fourth
quarter ending June 30 will be "at or near break even,"
rather than the slight profit some analysts had expected, Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report said. Craig-Hallum Inc.
analyst Dennis Nielsen told DJPIR he'd been estimating that
Orthomet would earn eight cents a share for the fourth
quarter, compared with a loss of 18 cents a share a year
earlier. Orthomet said fourth-quarter sales will exceed sales
for the year-earlier period, but won't match third quarter
sales.
   Newport News Savings Bank slid 1 to 3 after the Newport
News, Va., bank said United Financial Banking Cos. ended
merger talks between the two institutions.
   EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology fell 1 to 8 3/4
after the Hunt Valley, Md., environmental-consulting concern
cautioned investors that its net income for the third quarter
ended May 31 will be lower than the year-earlier net income
of 12 cents a share.
   Norstan tumbled 1 1/2 to 13 1/4 after the Minneapolis
digital communications concern said that it's reviewing the
value of its $5.65 million stake in New Summit Inc., which is
in default on certain of its loan covenants with a lender.
Norstan said that any potential reduction in the value of the
investment could will be recorded as a loss in the fourth
quarter ended April 30. However, the company said it expects
that operating income for the fourth quarter and year to be
in line with analysts' projections.

   URCARCO Inc. sold five million shares at $19.875 each on
May 31, but went public last November at $11 a share.
Friday's OTC Focus column incorrectly identified the May
stock sale as an initial public offering.
