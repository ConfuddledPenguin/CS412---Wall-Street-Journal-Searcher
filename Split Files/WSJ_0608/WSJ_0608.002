   CHICAGO -- Relentless rain in the southern Midwest,
coupled with new export demand, drove grain futures prices
strongly higher.
   Many areas of southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio -- which
have been inundated with rain in the past 30 days -- got more
than an inch of rain overnight Wednesday, and more was
expected last night.

   The wet weather has kept many farmers from finishing their
corn planting. Conventional wisdom calls for farmers to plant
all their corn within the first week of June for maximum
yields and to shift unplanted corn fields to soybeans after
that. AgResource Co. of Chicago said it reduced its planting
estimate for corn from 76 million acres to between 73.5 and
74 million acres and may reduce it again today if the rains
continue.
   The rain and cool temperatures also have inhibited growth
in what farmers have managed to plant, resulting in shallow
root development in the young corn crop, analysts said.
Weather forecasters now expect a high-pressure ridge to move
into the western corn belt soon, bringing hot, dry conditions
that could damage the fragile plants.
   Corn futures helped set the pace at the Chicago Board of
Trade as the July contract rose 5 1/2 cents a bushel to
settle at $2.8550.
   "We think weather becomes increasingly important as the
crop gets into its development stage, and it's likely that
corn futures will continue their rally," said Daniel Basse,
director of market research for AgResource.
   Soybean and related futures contracts also rose, both in
sympathy with corn and on expectations that Pakistan will
order 90,000 metric tons of soybean oil under the Food For
Peace program, analysts said. The July soybean oil contract,
which at one point was up by its one-cent-a-pound limit,
settled just shy of that at 24.42 cents a pound, up 0.97
cent.
   "Soybean oil traded over some very key resistance
patterns," said Steve Freed, senior grain analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. "In general, people think that beans
have turned the corner and bounced off their lows."
   Though beans can be planted later than corn, it's starting
to get late for bean planting as well, analysts said, and any
reduction in estimates of bean crop yields would drive prices
up.
   Wheat futures prices also rose, in part because the Soviet
Union was offered two million metric tons of export bonus
wheat, Mr. Basse of AgResource said. Weather also is a factor
for wheat, as the possibility of hot, dry conditions in the
Plains states threatens crops there.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices plunged in the final hour of a
volatile session in which edgy traders bid prices up or down
on the smallest of news events. Triggering the late sell-off
was a report that Exxon Corp. would reopen a refinery and
terminal in Linden, N.J., this month. The facilities were
closed early this year after a number of oil spills.
Presumably, the reopening of the refinery would add to the
already large gasoline inventories. Gains in gasoline prices
earlier had boosted crude contracts. Crude for July delivery
ended on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $16.67 a barrel,
down 25 cents. It had traded as high as $17.32 during the
session. Unleaded gasoline for July delivery wound up at
57.61 cents a gallon, down 0.75 cent.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended lower but partly
recovered from early declines. Gold for August delivery
finished with a loss of $2.90 an ounce at $358.10. July
silver was off 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.04. July platinum
declined $1.90 an ounce to $487.50. Japanese and Middle
Eastern selling of gold bullion combined to depress prices
early in the day, an analyst said. But the Middle Eastern
selling, which took place in Europe, didn't involve the large
quantities that caused prices to plunge twice recently, he
said. The soon-to-expire June contract, which reflected cash
market dealings, at one point fell as low as $352.10 an
ounce, off $5.30 from Wednesday's close, and August, the most
actively traded month, fell to another life-of-contract low
of $355.50. Reports of political unrest in the Soviet Union
played a role in the decline, as did concern that shortages
of foreign exchange in the Soviet Union and South Africa
could cause those nations to become more aggressive sellers
of gold. The analyst said that with Europe approaching its
summer vacation period, it's not likely to show the kind of
active demand that would be needed to boost prices. But
Richard Band, editor of Profitable Investing, a newsletter in
Potomac, Md., said: "I found it encouraging that gold came
back a bit from its early lows. This is a typical pattern of
a market nearing its bottom; it absorbs a lot of European
selling, then ends up moderately off the lows."
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were mixed, with the July contract
declining and new-crop months from October onward rising in
response to weather problems affecting the early part of the
next crop. July cotton, the last remaining current-crop
contract, ended with a loss of 0.26 cent a pound at 80.84
cents. Prices weakened as speculators and computer-driven
commodity funds sold the July contract after it traded above
a key resistance level and rose as high as 81.25 cents. When
it fell to a low of 79.80 cents, the selling waned and the
contract started to recover. The later contracts, for cotton
harvested in the 1990-91 season that will begin Aug. 1,
posted gains of between 0.35 cent and 1.13 cents a pound.
Demand was triggered by problems in unirrigated areas of the
Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Those areas haven't had any rain
in the past week and a half, and temperatures have soared, an
analyst said. The Rio Grande crop is important because it is
the first U.S. cotton harvested in the new season -- actually
beginning in July -- and so provides a continuity of supply,
tiding industry over from the old crop to the new one, the
analyst said.
