   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Strong first-quarter growth at
International Business Machines Corp. helped the information
industry buck a two-year slowdown, according to a report by a
market-research firm here.
   Gartner Group Inc. said IBM's 9.2% revenue growth during
the period beat the industry rate for the first time in five
years. That performance led to a reversal of the industry's
two-year trend toward slower growth: Gartner said revenue
posted a 7.7% gain from the year-earlier period, compared
with 5.5% year-to-year growth in the fourth quarter of 1989.

   But Gartner noted that industrywide profits declined
slightly, to 6.6% from 6.7%. It attributed the drop to a
continuing mainframe-computer price war, a move away from
proprietary systems, and a shift to smaller, less profitable
computers.
   Gartner added that the shift to smaller computers has
affected the software market markedly, with companies that
cater to the desktop market taking share away from mainframe
and minicomputer software vendors.
   Gartner also noted explosive growth in cellular-telephone
subscriptions, and "hearty" growth by several microchip
concerns. The company compiled its data from 221 publicly
held corporations in data processing, telecommunications and
electronic components.
