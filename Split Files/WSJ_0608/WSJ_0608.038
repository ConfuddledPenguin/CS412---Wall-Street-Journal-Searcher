   It says all you need to know about creative thinking in
Washington that the man who's written the education book of
the year couldn't get a job in the Bush administration.
   John Chubb, co-author (with Terry Moe) of an icon-smashing
book on school reform to be released today, was close to
being hired by the White House last year as its chief
education aide. The news somehow leaked to the press, and
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos protested to the White
House. Policy director Roger Porter says he admires Mr. Chubb
and Mr. Cavazos's opinion was "only one of many factors," but
Mr. Chubb still didn't get the job. His revenge now is that
his book will do more to improve the nation's schools than
will the least influential cabinet officer since Margaret
Heckler.

   That book, "Politics, Markets, and America's Schools,"
goes beyond the routine lament of failure. It explains why
even a decade of reform has failed. The authors finger the
bureaucracy and special interests that can calcify in the
joints of democracy. The failure lies with what is in effect
a socialist education system, controlled, from the top down,
by those with little incentive to change. The only solution
is "bottom-up accountability." That means creating a market
-- with universal public "scholarships" that would let
parents choose, or start, their own schools.
   The Chubb-Moe book is drawing special notice because its
sponsor, the Brookings Institution, is a liberal think tank
endorsing what is supposed to be a "conservative" idea. But
old stereotypes are falling in more places than Moscow. Even
many liberals are rethinking their traditional faith in the
bureaucratic, special-interest state. The metaphor of
"perestroika" applies here too. Some liberals are like
Soviets who've discovered that statism no longer serves even
the goal of equity.
   Mr. Chubb, a scholar of "liberal instincts" (his phrase),
says his own concern grew out of the failure of public
education to serve the urban poor. After 10 years studying
more than 20,000 educators and students at 500 high schools,
he became convinced that only radical "choice" will allow
reform to succeed. His conviction is now being endorsed in
small, grass-roots experiments from Cambridge, Mass., to East
Harlem, to Milwaukee.
   Needless to say, the Bush administration is not leading
this charge, and Mr. Cavazos seems barely to have noticed.
Aides insist he's a stalwart for choice, pointing to five
regional conferences he attended a year ago, but his recent
support is so quiet as to be undetectable.
   He last devoted a speech to choice in November. When
Milwaukee reformer Polly Williams visited Washington, Mr.
Cavazos couldn't fit her into his busy schedule. (This is the
same man whose "outreach" is praised by education lobbyists.)
Sources say he's also demoted his special adviser on choice,
John Klenk, who favors more aggressive leadership. (Mr. Klenk
won't comment, and Undersecretary Ted Sanders says Mr. Klenk
has been transferred but still does the same work.)
   Defenders say it's a matter of style, that Mr. Cavazos
prefers building "consensus" to confrontation. But after 10
years of debate, whatever consensus is possible already
exists. When Brookings and the Heritage Foundation agree, the
debate on substance is over. What's missing now is the
political will to challenge the interests (unions and
bureaucracy) that will never agree because their monopoly on
power is at risk.
   Listen to Debra DeLee, lobbyist for the National Education
Association, the Politburo of the education establishment.
Mr. Cavazos's support for choice, she says, "has been much
more low-key than we expected." She praises Mr. Cavazos for
adopting NEA language about school "restructuring" and
"site-based management" -- jargon for tinkering around the
edges of the system. Mr. Cavazos is at best timid, at worst a
cipher for the educators who've caused the current crisis.
   The White House has been better, which is not to say good
enough. President Bush has praised Polly Williams (thanks to
aide Jim Pinkerton), but choice was barely mentioned at his
"education summit" with governors last fall.
   The administration hails "choice," but in a generic sense
that can be sapped of real meaning. In particular, it won't
explicitly endorse choice involving private schools. Yet Mr.
Chubb says that choice among existing public schools alone is
mere "Soviet-style choice." A market can only liberate if the
supply of schools can also be increased. That means including
private schools, or at the very least breaking all barriers
to the creation of new public schools.
   The Bush team has stressed national testing in a few
subjects, a modest reform but also one that by itself can be
co-opted by education's "nomenklatura". Many administrators
and politicians will begin to gear instruction to satisfy
tests, not students or parents. In the current system, tests
could become as deceptive as Soviet five-year plans.
   The federal role in education is blessedly small, so Mr.
Chubb's most important readers are spread across America. But
that only underscores the abdication when Mr. Cavazos mutes
his only real power, the stature to speak the blunt truth of
the sort offered by John Chubb. George Bush seems unlikely to
be the education president with this education secretary.
