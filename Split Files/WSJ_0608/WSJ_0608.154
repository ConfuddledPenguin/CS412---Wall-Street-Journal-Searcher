   WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan commission is recommending that
the political parties shave a day off their four-day
quadrennial conventions in an effort to sharpen their appeal
to television voters.
   The commission, which includes five current or past
national party chairmen, also recommends that each of the
major television networks allocate three hours of air time
for use by the parties and presidential candidates in the
months leading to the presidential election.

   The commission suggests that during the parties' air time,
only the presidential and vice-presidential candidates be
permitted to address the public. The use of pre-produced
materials such as taped candidate biographies would be
barred.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald Brown already has
indicated his willingness to tinker with the national
political convention. He is toying with proposals either to
compress the proceedings or to conduct some of them over a
weekend, rather than during the week.
   Commission members said taking a day off the conventions
would make the proceedings seem less tedious. "We've got to
make them more enlightening and better to watch," said former
GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf.
