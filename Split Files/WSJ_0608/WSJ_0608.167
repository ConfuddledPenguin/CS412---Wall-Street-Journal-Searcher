   WELLSBURG, W.Va. -- For two years, residents of this rural
hamlet feasted on cottage-cheese omelets and did daily
rigorous exercises as part of a bold medical experiment. The
maker of Bayer aspirin wanted to see if changes in diet and
life style could bring more "wellness" to Wellsburg.
   The Bayer Wellness Program is a widely publicized study
pegged to making people aware of how to lower the risk of
heart attacks. It officially ends this weekend, and there
have been some successes in lowering cholesterol and
blood-pressure levels, among other health benefits.
Participants didn't necessarily take aspirin, although in
promotional material Bayer noted that its product could
prevent second heart attacks.

   In addition, to ensure that townspeople stay on the
healthy track, Bayer has donated $30,000 to install a jogging
trail as well as other programs to keep the health
consciousness going.
   But while the program seems to have temporarily promoted
some better health here, residents aren't certain that's
something to cheer about. And some wonder whether the program
will result in lasting change, as people return to their old
habits and patterns.
   Joan Wilson, for one, is glad it's over.
   "Honey, these people ate so much oat bran around here that
it was unbelievable," says Mrs. Wilson, owner of Ye Ole
Townhouse, a local restaurant. Now that the program is
ending, though, "some of these people are switching from fish
and going back to what they used to order, like B.L.T.s," she
adds. "You can't eat oatmeal forever."
   For 67-year-old Charlotte Jackson, the program wasn't as
successful as she'd hoped. "I like to eat. I did cut down on
the red meats and watched the fat, but my cholesterol is
still over 200," says the 5-foot-1-inch, 180-pound Mrs.
Jackson.
   Others say they've changed their life styles only
partially. Ronald Antigo was tricked into participating by
his wife, who poured skim milk into whole-milk containers and
used turkey in recipes like chili that called for ground
beef. He initially lost about 10 pounds, but since he retired
in January, he's been eating more -- and now has gained those
pounds back. He also gave up smoking and drinking, but now
spends $30 a month on chewing gum.
   The town's ambivalence toward its new-found health is
immediately apparent to any visitor. A banner at the edge of
town reads, "Welcome to Wellsburg, Home of the Bayer Wellness
Program." Underneath, in big red letters, another banner
reads: "Buy One Sundae Get Another One Free," an
advertisement for Dad's Sweet Tooth, the local ice-cream
emporium.
   "We still have people who come in here and buy ice cream,"
says Charis Moatis, manager of the malt shop. Even residents
who choose the lower-calorie frozen yogurt, which has been a
big seller the past two years, heap on sundae toppings, she
says.
   Still, Bayer officials insist that the $3.3 million
program was a success -- and results give some support to
their assertions. "We proved our point," asserts Richard
Gaccione, president of Bayer, which is owned by Eastman Kodak
Co. through its Sterling Drug unit. "You can actually get
people to change their life styles and vital signs in such a
way that they can reduce heart attacks in their community."
   Wellsburg was selected as the program site because it was
a small, generally unhealthy town in a state with high levels
of obesity, cholesterol and heart disease. (West Virginia
ranks seventh in the nation in the incidence of heart attack,
according to the latest study by the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.)
   At the program's outset, 65% of the 517 people who
participated the full two years (another 500 or so dropped
out along the way) had a cholesterol level of 200 or more.
Though 55% still do, cholesterol levels for the group fell an
average 12 points, to 208 from 220.
   That may not sound like much. But each one-point drop
lowers the likelihood of heart attack by 2%. "They're going
to get a 25% fall in their heart-attack rate. That's
tremendous," says William Castelli, director of a division of
the National Institutes of Health that studies heart disease
in Framingham, Mass. "You have to fight for every 1% fall.
They did it hygienically, no drugs."
   Consider Earl Mitchell, a self-described onetime "couch
potato" and fan of fast food. He lost 80 pounds and trimmed
50 points off his cholesterol level. "The program has changed
my life completely," he says.
   Though other health experts view the results positively,
they are also somewhat skeptical because Bayer won't publish
them in any medical journal. Bayer's Mr. Gaccione explains
that this wasn't a clinical study, so Bayer won't publish
results in medical journals; however, it will publish results
for its own staff and make those findings available.
   The participation group also lowered its average pulse
rate by five beats per minute, its average systolic blood
pressure by six points and achieved an 11% reduction in body
fat (though the average weight loss was just 3.4 pounds).
   The best results were achieved among residents with the
highest risk of heart disease. The average cholesterol of
this subgroup dropped 18 points, to 226 from 244. "The sicker
they were, the more effective we were in getting them to make
behavioral change," says William Reger, director of the
program.
   Behavioral changes included a daily regimen of exercise
(regular exercisers increased to 60% of participants from 26%
previously). In addition, participants were encouraged to
attend medical lectures and were advised on their diets.
Bayer hired four full-time staff workers to run the program,
and there were 250 volunteers who conducted support sessions
for people trying to quit smoking (57% did).
   "We didn't tell people what they could and couldn't do,"
Dr. Reger says. "We gave them the information to make the
proper choices."
