   Lawrence Sanders has been producing best-selling crime
novels for several years, slickly written books that often
revolve around schemes to separate gullible folk from their
funds.
   Mr. Sanders's latest, "Sullivan's Sting" (Putnam, 348
pages, $19.95), is set in south Florida, represented here as
a veritable wildlife refuge for white-collar scam artists. An
unnamed short-term supra-agency has been set up by the
Justice Department to bust some of the more flagrant
swindlers. The agents' attentions soon focus on David
Rathbone, a handsome and well-tailored manipulator who
specializes in preying upon the elderly rich.

   Rathbone's credo: "The ignorance and greed of most people
were simply inexhaustible, and a man would be a fool not to
harvest that bounty." His current brainstorm is "The Fort
Knox Commodity Trading Fund," which uses unwitting investors'
cash to buy and sell options and futures in cocaine,
marijuana and heroin.
   Into this shark's pool slithers Rita Angela Sullivan,
beautiful female cop posing as shady lady in order to get
close to Rathbone. The ploy works, and a torrid affair ensues
-- all in the line of duty, Sullivan tells Tony Harker, the
agency boss with whom she also becomes physically involved.
But Harker wonders. In this world-class hustlers' paradise,
even the straightest arrows can get bent.
   Other writers (Ross Thomas, Elmore Leonard, Donald
Westlake) might be more inventive or amusing with such
material, but Mr. Sanders tells a good story in his own
capable way. His smooth-talking players "in the game" are
fascinating to watch as they make their moves on the
"suckers" and "mooches." Rathbone is the most compulsive
cheat of all, a man who doesn't pay for anything if he can
steal it and who skims from his partners' take as a matter of
course.
   Short chapters and a large cast keep the plot moving and
the pages turning. Even the sex scenes are fairly nimbly
handled (although this reader still has trouble accepting the
use of "pleasure" as a verb).
   Like Lawrence Sanders, Joseph Wambaugh has been a
brand-name writer for many seasons, with nearly a dozen
fiction and nonfiction best sellers under his belt. His new
novel, "The Golden Orange" (Perigord Press/Morrow, 317 pages,
$19.95), also is set in a sun-and-money zone: the "gold
coast" of Orange County, Calif., known to the book's local
cops as "le Cote de Fraud."
   Winnie Farlowe was one of those cops, a detective for
nearly 15 years until a back injury forced him into early
retirement and caused a drinking problem he belligerently
denies. Forty, divorced, all but unemployable, Farlowe spends
much of his time swilling Polish vodka at Spoon's Landing, a
local dive filled with relentlessly colorful boozers and
losers.
   There Winnie is sought out by Tess Binder, a beautiful
three-time divorcee apparently attracted by news accounts of
Farlowe's flamboyant escapades. Tess is well-off by Winnie's
standards but poor by her own. Down to her last $50,000, she
keenly feels in need of another wealthy husband, preferably
"F.F.H." (Forbes 400) and "one who would not insist on a
prenuptial agreement."
   However implausibly, the "hot momma" and the ex-cop become
an item. Winnie turns detective again when it seems someone
is stalking Tess with murderous intent. Could this have
something to do with the deferred inheritance left Binder by
her father, a suicide? Or is there much more here than Winnie
Farlowe, "straight-ahead guy," is being told?
   Mr. Wambaugh sketches with broad satiric strokes, and his
often lurid style may take some getting used to. Many of his
characters speak in nearly interchangeable cynical-hip
one-liners, with racist and sexist slurs all part of the
accepted copshop banter. And his prose has a disconcerting
tendency to veer from raw action to intimate musings to
travel-brochure trivia without so much as a hand signal. But
even at its most cartoonish, "The Golden Orange" has its own
sort of charm.
   New to the best-seller lists is Sue Grafton, whose seventh
mystery featuring female Southern California private
investigator Kinsey Millhone, "`G' Is for Gumshoe" (Henry
Holt, 261 pages, $16.95), is proving to be her "breakout"
book.
   Millhone, who narrates her own case reports, is an
extremely likable individual: funny, articulate, tough-minded
and capable. As "Gumshoe" begins, she is having her 33rd
birthday, "after what seemed like an interminable twelve
months of being thirty-two" -- a nice in-joke for faithful
readers aware that the first six books in this alphabetical
series all took place within that one fictional year.
   Two things keep Kinsey busy throughout "Gumshoe": finding
a client's elderly mother gone missing, first from a trailer
home near the Mojave Desert, then from a nursing home in
Kinsey's town of Santa Teresa; and dodging a psychotic hit
man hired by a vindictive convict Millhone helped put away.
   To deal with the hit man, Kinsey enlists the services of
another PI, a no-nonsense cop named Robert Dietz who signs on
as a full-time bodyguard (and, eventually, a bit more).
Meanwhile, the case of the missing mother has Millhone
untangling a deadly chain of events rooted in the past.
   Several elements make "Gumshoe" one of the best entries
yet in this consistently appealing series. The out-of-nowhere
appearances by the assassin -- a spooky guy who brings his
little boy along on jobs -- provide genuine jolts, bursts of
adrenaline that interrupt Kinsey's usual wisecracking mode
and induce a giddy vertigo. The mystery proper has some of
the intriguing qualities of a Ross Macdonald puzzle, dank
with long-buried secrets and lingering guilts.
   Major, minor and recurring characters of all ages are
quirky and vivid, like the ensemble company of the greatest
TV show you'll never see. (Creating interesting and
believable older women and men is something the author is
especially good at.) And Millhone's distinctive running
monologue, full of pithy descriptions and sardonic
observations, pulls all this together in a most engaging
manner.
   Whatever the formula, its entertaining results make Ms.
Grafton's alphabetical "Gumshoe" seem an especially deserving
best seller. May it have at least 19 equally successful
sequels.
