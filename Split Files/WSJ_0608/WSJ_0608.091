   HOUSTON -- Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc. said it
hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to assist it in a potential sale
of the company. The oil and gas concern disclosed early last
month that it was putting itself up for sale. Industry
experts have estimated the company might bring as much as $2
billion, or in the lower-to-mid $20-a-share range, if sold in
its entirety.
   Union Texas is 40%-owned Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and
40%-owned by Allied-Signal Inc.
