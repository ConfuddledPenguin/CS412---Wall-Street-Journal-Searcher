   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is stuck in a
bind, as it attempts to pick a new chief for the first time
in six years.
   Four months after Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. announced he
plans to retire by year end, the Big Board hasn't settled on
a successor and doesn't have a strong frontrunner, people
familiar with the deliberations say.

   Mr. Phelan is increasingly eager to get the matter
resolved soon. But an internal wrangle has emerged about
whether Richard A. Grasso, the exchange's president and chief
operating officer, should be named chairman, rather than a
high-profile outsider.
   Mr. Grasso is well regarded within the securities
industry, but little known outside Wall Street. He initially
wasn't considered a primary candidate for the chairmanship.
   But many Big Board floor traders believe Mr. Grasso has
become a stronger candidate in recent weeks, because the
exchange's selection committee so far hasn't lured a big-name
outsider. Mr. Grasso, with Mr. Phelan's encouragement, has
been trying to strengthen his ties with influential floor
traders and Wall Street executives. As a candidate, "Grasso
is very much bubbling to the top . . . through attrition of
other ingredients in the soup," a top Big Board trader says.
   The problem is that Mr. Phelan, a former trader who wasn't
a prominent name when he took over as Big Board chairman, has
elevated the job into a sort of Wall Street ambassadorship.
Mr. Phelan, for example, played an important public role in
reassuring investors during the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   He has become so well known that many influential members
of the exchange prefer a successor from outside with
comparable weight. Yet many financial heavyweights don't see
the post, in which Mr. Phelan is paid what people at the
exchange say is between $750,000 and $1 million a year, as an
exalted job by Wall Street's lucrative standards.
   People familiar with the deliberations say the Big Board's
eight-member search committee has long had a short list of
celebrated outsiders to whom it would gladly offer the
chairmanship. The committee hasn't made any formal offers,
these people say, but instead is feeling out potential
interest among the candidates.
   One name on the list is Warren Buffett, the celebrated
stock-picker and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Mr.
Buffett declines to comment, but people familiar with the
matter say he doesn't want the job; instead, the exchange has
turned to Mr. Buffett as an informal consultant on potential
candidates.
   Another name on the Big Board's list is Frank T. Cary,
former chairman of International Business Machines Corp. and
a member of the so-called transition committee to find a
successor to Mr. Phelan. Mr. Cary wouldn't comment, but
people say his star has faded because of opposition on the
exchange floor.
   Another person on the list is the investment banker James
D. Wolfensohn; he also declines to comment. Former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, chairman of the firm that
bears Mr. Wolfensohn's name, also was coveted by the Big
Board until the American Stock Exchange persuaded him
recently to be a board member there.
   It is often difficult to convince top talent to head stock
exchanges. "It's not at all unnatural that the type of
suspects you'd first identify are busy doing something else,"
says Gordon Macklin, former head of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq automated
quotations stock-trading system that competes with the Big
Board.
   "On the other hand," says Mr. Macklin, now chairman of the
securities firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., "the (Big Board)
position is of such economic significance that they can, and
ultimately will, locate a very strong candidate. John did
give them plenty of time."
   The Big Board, which is running head-to-head with the
Tokyo Stock Exchange for the title of the world's biggest,
has a host of thorny issues awaiting its new chairman. These
include a slow but steady loss of trading business to
regional, off-exchange and overseas markets, and a recession
on Wall Street. Last year, the Big Board's earnings plunged
40% to $6.3 million; its return on members' equity sank to
only 2.7% from an average of 11% in the previous four years.
   Mr. Phelan himself has encouraged the perception that,
amid the rapid changes in the securities business, the Big
Board chairmanship has blossomed into a more important job
than it was in past decades. The chairmanship is "a
backbreaking job" these days, Mr. Phelan said in a recent
interview; he suggested that when he leaves, the exchange may
need a new management structure with more than one "chairman
type" at the top.
   Some exchange members still don't see Mr. Grasso as the
solution, though they are comfortable with his overseeing the
exchange's nuts and bolts.
   "The feeling is that (Mr. Grasso) will be a tremendous
support to whoever comes in," says one of the most important
directors at the Big Board, speaking only if he wasn't
identified. "But what we probably need as chairman is someone
with an outside reputation."
   Indeed, the Amex, while no match for the Big Board in
size, has restored some of its stature among Wall Street
executives, after luring former Congressman James R. Jones to
succeed longtime Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. Mr. Jones got Mr.
Volcker to be a board member as a personal favor. The Amex
also has a well-regarded president, Kenneth Leibler.
   Donald S. MacNaughton, chairman of the executive committee
at HealthTrust Inc. and head of the Big Board's search
committee, declined to comment.
   A Big Board spokesman said: "The members of the transition
committee have been diligently and thoughtfully talking to
people throughout the securities industry, as well as key
corporate leaders, for their input. Their work is ongoing,
and when it has been completed, it will be presented to the
full board for their review. There is nothing more we can add
at this time."
   Yesterday, the Big Board, as expected, named as a vice
chairman John S. Chalsty, who is president and chief
executive officer of the securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Inc., a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of
the U.S. That makes Mr. Chalsty, who retains his Donaldson
Lufkin position, the highest-ranking officer of the exchange
from a large Wall Street firm. Donald Stone, a senior partner
at the exchange specialist firm Lasker, Stone &amp; Stern,
remains the exchange's other vice chairman.
   The exchange's board also elected three new directors to
two-year terms: Philip J. Purcell, chairman of Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co.'s Dean Witter Financial Services Group Inc.; John L.
Clendenin, chairman of BellSouth Corp.; and Stanley C. Gault,
chairman of Rubbermaid Inc.. And it elected two new directors
to one-year terms: David L. Luke III, chairman of Westvaco
Corp.; and Daniel P. Tully, president of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
