   IRT Corp. said it has completed new lender bank agreements
and a private-equity financing of about $4 million, led by
Euro-American-I L.P. of Menlo Park, Calif.
   IRT, which makes automated X-ray equipment used to monitor
manufacturing processes, said the equity investment consists
of about $4 million of convertible preferred stock purchased
by investors and members of the IRT board. Four of the five
IRT board members are buying some $650,000 of the preferred,
each share of which is priced at $16 and is convertible into
10 common shares. The stock initially carries a cumulative
annual dividend of 7%.

   IRT of San Diego said proceeds from the investment will be
used in part to pay existing credit with Sanwa Bank. IRT also
said Sanwa has renewed its line of credit for $3 million
through April 1, 1991, under new agreements.
   In addition, IRT said that Citibank, a unit of Citicorp,
restructured a $5 million senior subordinated note to an
amended senior subordinated seven-year note with amortization
beginning in fiscal year 1993. The note initially has reduced
interest rates. Citibank also forgave a note for $885,000,
originally due April 1, 1990, and forgave accrued but unpaid
interest of about $200,000.
