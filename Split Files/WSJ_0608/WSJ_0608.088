   NEW YORK -- U.S. high-tech money managers are applying
their skills to global investing.
   One recent entrant -- the Celebration Fund -- uses a
computerized investing strategy to shuffle money between U.S.
and Japanese stock markets, moving into whichever one is
stronger.

   The fund, begun Oct. 31, has already drawn $700 million
from Japanese institutional investors. And the fund enabled
them to dodge the Tokyo stock market's plunge earlier this
year with a well-timed switch out of Japanese stocks.
   The fund uses a mathematical model developed by Leland
O'Brien Rubenstein Associates Inc., a Los Angeles high-tech
money manager that won notoriety in the U.S. for inventing
portfolio insurance. Portfolio insurance uses stock-index
futures to guard an investor's portfolio against a stock
market decline; the strategy was widely popular until the
1987 market crash, when the method didn't work as forecast
and even helped accelerate the plunge in stocks.
   It's no accident that the new fund is aimed exclusively at
big Japanese investors. With plenty of cash, but little
black-box investing technology of their own, the Japanese
have been eager to tap U.S. computerized investing skills.
These include tactical asset allocation (switching between
stocks, bonds and cash), stock-sector selection, and
computer-driven program trading of stock and stock-index
futures.
   The Celebration Fund is managed by Wells Fargo Nikko,
jointly owned by Japan's Nikko Securities Co. and Wells Fargo
&amp; Co., the big San Francisco bank. Last year, Nikko paid $125
million for a 50% stake in Wells Fargo Investment Advisors,
one of the two largest U.S. computer-based money managers,
with $80 billion under management.
   First Quadrant Corp. this week announced joint ventures
with Japanese and French financial institutions to do global
asset allocation. Earlier this spring, Templeton
International, a longtime global stock manager headed by Sir
John Templeton, acquired a small quantitatively oriented firm
to supplement its traditional stock-picking.
   The latest Leland O'Brien strategy involves selling stocks
in whichever market is weaker, the U.S. or Tokyo, and moving
money into the stronger market until the trend reverses. That
can involve rapid trading. From November to January, the
Celebration Fund swung its $700 million out of Japanese
stocks entirely, and into the U.S. market. That allowed the
Japanese investors to sidestep most of the Tokyo market's
plunge. Unlike portfolio insurance, which uses stock-index
futures, the Celebration Fund trades in actual stocks.
   At the end of each year, Leland O'Brien says, investors
should end up with much of the profits from the
better-performing market.
   If more money flows into this strategy, it could
ultimately produce trading stampedes that would make global
market swings more severe. That's unlikely to happen, though,
unless $10 billion or more is committed to the strategy,
asserts Jeffrey Skelton, a vice chairman of Wells Fargo Nikko
Investment Advisors.
   So far, the Celebration Fund has performed well. For its
first seven months ended May 31, the fund's value rose 7.5%
in yen terms. That's far ahead of a 9.4% drop in the value of
the Tokyo stock market, and part of the way toward the 16.2%
gain in the U.S. market. By comparison, a fund invested half
in U.S. stocks and half in Japanese stocks would have been up
about 3.5%.
   Exactly how well Leland O'Brien's strategy works is still
open to debate. The past eight months' conditions -- with the
plunge in the Tokyo market and the U.S. market's surge --
have been just about ideal for the strategy. It hasn't yet
been tested under the most difficult conditions -- a
trendless, choppy market in both countries.
   Leland O'Brien's strategy of jumping into the
better-performing market could leave the fund whipsawed if
market trends constantly reverse.
   Leland O'Brien executives say their strategy should
capture 90% of the "absolute relative return" of the better
performing market. That's a complex yardstick, though, that
few other people use. By normal measuring standards, the
Leland O'Brien strategy so far seems to deliver 60% to 70% of
the gain of the better performing market if the two markets
diverge sharply, or a few percentage points behind the
average of the two markets if their performances are nearly
identical.
   A Nikko spokesman says Japanese investors are likely to be
offered a Celebration II fund and Celebration III soon. In
the U.S., Wells Fargo Nikko says some American clients appear
interested in a similar strategy. For its part, Leland
O'Brien hopes to apply its computer model to European stock
markets, too.
