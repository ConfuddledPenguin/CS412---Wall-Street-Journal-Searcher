   WASHINGTON -- A House Appropriations subcommittee approved
a $20.9 billion fiscal 1991 energy and water bill providing
$318 million for the superconducting supercollider and adding
substantially to President Bush's budget for cleaning up
nuclear-weapons plants.
   An estimated $2.7 billion would be allocated to the
military component of the Energy Department's program in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, a 41% increase from current
spending. An additional $563.7 million would be provided for
related domestic accounts, and the total of nearly $3.28
billion for the cleanup represents an increase of $488
million from the administration's budget request and more
than $1 billion from the current year.

   "We have to move faster," said Rep. Tom Bevill (D., Ala.),
chairman of the subcommittee. "This is a critical situation
and I wanted to make sure we have the necessary resources to
clean up this mess."
   Within Congress, the cleanup of hazardous materials at the
weapons plants commands strong bipartisan support. But as the
first of the appropriations bills slated to come before the
House, the high costs of the energy and water legislation are
sure to draw opposition. The measure represents a net
increase of approximately $541 million above the
administration's budget for comparable accounts, and White
House Budget Director Richard Darman has sought to delay any
action until an agreement is reached on a final spending plan
for the new fiscal year.
   The subcommittee action came as a closed-door meeting of
Democratic leaders of the full Appropriations Committee
approved tentative allocations for the 13 spending bills to
fund the government in fiscal 1991. Discretionary
appropriations for foreign aid would be increased to an
estimated $15.1 billion, in close conformity with the
president's request. But elsewhere, Pentagon funding would be
cut deeply to offset increases in domestic spending. The
major Pentagon bill would be held to $262.8 billion, compared
with $287.1 billion under Mr. Bush's budget, while at the
same time, the two largest domestic appropriations bills
would grow by more than $10 billion over the administration's
request.
   Discretionary funding for the Departments of Labor, Health
and Human Services, and Education would be set at
approximately $52.75 billion, for example, compared with
$46.2 billion requested by the administration. Housing,
environmental, veterans, and space programs would grow to
$63.4 billion, compared with the $59.2 billion sought
initially by the president.
   Though the bill approved yesterday by the subcommittee
fell within the guidelines of the House-passed budget
resolution, the legislation invites criticism by adding tens
of millions of dollars for new research and
water-construction projects favored by influential members.
In a step sure to provoke controversy, the subcommittee broke
with its practice in recent years and provided a total of $40
million to $50 million in grants to five select universities
for science facilities backed by senior appropriators from
Ohio, Alabama, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Indiana.
   Mr. Bevill, for example, secured $10 million for a
biomedical building at the University of Alabama, and Rep.
Silvio Conte, the ranking Republican on the full
Appropriations Committee, added an undisclosed sum for Boston
College.
   Though the full details weren't available after the
closed-door meeting, Rep. John Myers, the ranking Republican
on the subcommittee, won funding for Indiana State, while the
University of New Orleans and Case Western University would
benefit from funding backed by Reps. Lindy Boggs (D., La.)
and Louis Stokes (D., Ohio).
   Within the Bureau of Reclamation, an estimated $30 million
is provided for the Garrison irrigation and water-diversion
unit in North Dakota. Though controversial in the
administration's eyes, the sum was justified as a compromise
between Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) and wildlife proponents
opposed to the immense project.
   Elsewhere, Army Corps of Engineers construction funding
would grow to $1.36 billion, a nearly 11% increase from the
president's budget and including as many as 25 new
construction starts.
   For the White House, the Texas-based superconducting
supercollider is a major political priority, and the $318
million represents the president's full request and a more
than 45% increase from what was appropriated for the current
year. More than half the total, approximately $168.8 million,
is expected to be allocated for early construction of the
immense atom smasher, and the remainder is divided $33
million for capital equipment and $116 million for operations
and research and development.
   The administration is pursuing foreign support to help
offset the burgeoning costs of the project. But after making
cuts for this year, both the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees appear prepared to proceed at least at the level
sought by the president.
   Though the administration has so far resisted, House rules
permit the Appropriations Committee to proceed with its bills
after May 15, whether or not a formal budget has been adopted
by Congress. The Senate needs only a simple majority -- not
60 votes -- to waive restrictions and follow suit, and
whatever the merits of the House-passed budget, it can be
argued that it provides more discipline than no resolution at
all.
