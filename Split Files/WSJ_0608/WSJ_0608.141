   DALLAS -- Laurence Vineyard Jr., a former Dallas lawyer
and onetime owner of a Colorado thrift, agreed to plead
guilty to a charge that he misapplied the proceeds of loan
from the defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association of Dallas,
the Justice Deparment said.
   The charge, filed yesterday in federal court in Dallas,
involves a $12.7 million loan that Mr. Vineyard obtained from
Vernon Savings on the same day he was indicted for fraud in
connection with his ownership of Key Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Englewood, Colo.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Vineyard had financed his purchase of Key Savings with
a loan from Vernon and was to pay down a portion of that debt
with the new loan. Instead, according to the new criminal
charge, Mr. Vineyard drew $2.6 million on the loan and used
the money to purchase a $1.18 million mansion and to
establish trust funds for his children.
   Mr. Vineyard, 41 years old, currently is serving a
five-year prison term for his conviction on fraud charges
related to Key Savings. The new fraud charge carries a
maximum penalty of five years in federal prison and a fine of
up to twice the loss he caused to Vernon Savings.
