   NEW YORK -- Investors, turning more cautious on the
outlook for corporate profits and interest rates, sold stocks
yesterday, sending the market into its third consecutive
decline.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.32 to 2897.33.
The last string of three declines in the industrial average
occurred on April 20, 23 and 24, part of a five-session drop
in the average.

   Among the broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 1.81 to 363.15; the New York Stock Exchange
composite index dropped 0.94 to 198.21 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market index slipped 1.71 to 338.27.
   Volume totaled 160,420,000 shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, where declining issues outpaced advancers, 852 to
638.
   Futures-related sell programs weighed on the market
yesterday. Some big institutional investors are trying to get
out of the June S&amp;P 500 contract and into the September
contract before next Friday's quarterly expiration of
stock-index futures and options, analysts said. They
explained that the profits might be bigger now than if the
investors waited until next week.
   Some technology and energy issues, which led the rally on
various days last month, fell back. Compaq Computer dropped 1
3/8 to 121 3/4 and International Business Machines remained
unchanged at 120 5/8. Exxon fell 1/4 to 47 5/8 on 1.1 million
shares.
   Among other big blue chips: Boeing eased 1 1/8 to 83 7/8,
Merck dropped 1 1/4 to 81 1/2, Coca-Cola Co. fell 5/8 to 44
3/4 and General Motors dropped 1/2 to 49 3/8.
   Yesterday's decline was muted because many investors are
willing to buy at lower prices, said Dan Williams, head of
institutional trading at Dillon Read. "They are not anxious
to chase the market, but buyers are still around," he said.
   One sector in favor yesterday was financial shares,
especially savings and loans. HomeFed rose 1 to 32 3/4 and
Great Western Financial gained 1/4 to 20 1/2.
   J. David Mills, senior vice president at Boston Co.
Advisers, said he has recently bought financial stocks
because many high-quality companies have been beaten down
with the broad sell-off in that sector over the past several
weeks.
   Among his recent purchases are Republic New York Corp.,
Golden West Financial and KeyCorp. However, Mr. Mills remains
defensive on the stock market overall. "The market has a
price-earnings ratio of 16 times earnings and that isn't
attractive; the current rally has a limited lifespan," he
asserted.
   Apparel retailers, a focus of profit-taking earlier in the
week, recorded especially steep losses amid disappointment
with apparel-sales figures for May from the nation's major
retail chains. Gap Inc. plummeted 4 3/8 to 58 1/2 and Limited
Inc. dropped 1 7/8 to 47 3/8.
   Precious-metals stocks were hit with heavy selling as gold
prices remained under pressure. August gold futures fell
below $360 in New York trading, reflecting fears about the
possibility of additional gold-bullion sales by the Soviet
Union and Middle Eastern investors and other factors.
   Battle Mountain Gold tumbled 3/4 to 11 1/2 in Big Board
composite trading of 1.4 million shares -- close to six times
its average daily volume -- while American Barrick Resources
dropped 7/8 to 16 1/2 on 1.1 million shares. Among other gold
stocks, Placer Dome slipped 5/8 to 14 3/8, Hecla Mining slid
1/2 to 11 1/2, Homestake Mining fell 1 to 16 3/4 and Newmont
Mining eased 1 1/2 to 42 5/8.
   Genentech, the most active Big Board issue, dropped 1 to
26 1/4 on 3.4 million shares. The sell-off followed a court
decision denying a bid to block the company's shareholders
from voting on its proposed merger with Roche Holding of
Switzerland, which denied market speculation Wednesday that
it was interested in acquiring
   Eastman Kodak's Sterling Drug unit. Kodak rose 5/8 to 42
1/2 as 1.8 million shares were traded.
   Norton dropped 1 1/2 to 87 7/8 on 1.8 million shares.
France's Saint-Gobain, which has agreed to buy the company
for $90 a share, said the staff of a government committee
that regulates foreign investment in the U.S. will conduct an
investigation of the proposed transaction.
   Motorola climbed 2 5/8 to 85 7/8. As expected, the
Japanese government selected the company's digital-voice
technology as part of a national standard for cellular
telephones.
   SmithKline Beecham gained 3/4 to 47 1/4. The company named
Jan Leschly, president and chief operating officer of Squibb
before last year's merger with Bristol-Myers, to head its
world-wide pharmaceuticals business.
   Quaker Oats added 1/4 to 52 5/8 after Merrill Lynch
upgraded the stock's short-term investment rating. Analyst
William Maguire told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
that the company "is a very good asset play" and could become
a target of a "strategic acquisition" at $70 a share over the
next couple of years.
   Computer Associates International, which has been on the
rise since Dean Witter Reynolds repeated a buy recommendation
earlier this week, added 1/4 to 16 1/2 as 1.7 million shares
were traded. Analyst Timothy R. McCollum told the investor
report the software producer should benefit from "good
product cycles" among mainframe-computer manufacturers.
   Western Co. of North America rose 3/4 to 18. The company
said it is considering spinning off a stake in its
offshore-drilling business to shareholders.
   News Corp. went up 1/2 to 16 3/4. The company, burdened
with more than $6 billion in debt, disclosed plans to sell a
49% stake in the parent company of South China Morning Post,
a Hong Kong-based newspaper.
   Schering-Plough fell 7/8 to 45 3/8 after terminating an
agreement to sell its Maybelline cosmetics unit for $300
million to a group that includes the unit's management,
Playtex Family Products and Thomas H. Lee Co. Instead, the
company agreed to sell Maybelline to a group organized by the
buy-out firm of Wasserstein Perella for the same price.
   Reynolds Metals lost 1 to 58 1/8 after PaineWebber
downgraded the stock's investment rating, based on its belief
that the issue is less attractive after a recent jump in
price.
   Illinois Power dropped 3/4 to 15 1/2 in the wake of a
decision by state regulators to grant the company a $75
million rate increase, about one-third of what it had
requested.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.62
to 363.57. Volume totaled 11,480,000 shares.
