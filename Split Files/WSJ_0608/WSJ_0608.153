   WOLFSBURG, West Germany -- Volkswagen AG outlined plans
for an expanded joint venture to produce and market autos and
car parts in Yugoslavia.
   The company said previously that it intended to expand its
relationship with the Yugoslavian industrial group UNIS.
Under a new agreement, Volkswagen will increase its stake in
the auto maker Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo to 50% from 49%.
UNIS will hold the remaining 50% of in Tvornica, which will
be transformed under new government rules into a West
German-style private limited-liability company, Volkswagen
said.

   Volkswagen, West Germany's largest auto maker, said it
will boost its stake in the Yugoslavian company by
subscribing to a planned, though unspecified, increase in
Tvornica's share capital.
   Volkswagen said Tvornica has begun a 200 million-mark
($118.3 million), five-year capital investment program,
ending in 1995. The investments will be directed toward
modernizing the Yugoslavian venture's national production
network in an effort to boosts its competitive strength.
   Volkswagen said the most important of the new projects at
Tvornica, already a major supplier of diverse auto parts for
Volkswagen cars, will be to make rear axles to be supplied to
the West German company's Seat auto subsidiary in Spain.
Those deliveries are expected to begin by the end of this
year. The company hopes to gear up to assemble car engines by
the end of 1991.
   The capital investment program also is aimed at boosting
Tvornica's output of complete Volkswagen autos to about
45,000 units in 1992 from an aggregate 35,000 VW Golfs,
Jettas and Caddy models last year.
   The joint-venture company hopes to boost annual sales in
1992 to the equivalent of 700 million marks from 484 million
marks in 1989, Volkswagen said. The Yugoslavian venture
projects export sales in that period to rise to about 220
million marks from 150 million marks.
   Volkswagen has gotten off to a quick start in broadening
its business and operating presence in Eastern Europe,
following the opening of the Berlin Wall late last year. The
company has a major car development, production and marketing
venture planned for East Germany, and is negotiating a
similar arrangement with Czechoslavakia's auto maker, Skoda.
