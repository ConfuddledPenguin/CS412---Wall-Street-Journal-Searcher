   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Edward Tracy, the president of
Donald Trump's Atlantic City holdings, said none of the
beleaguered casino owner's three casinos are for sale.
   Mr. Tracy tried to allay concerns that Mr. Trump's casino
properties were not doing well, and predicted they would
produce "an avalanche of cash" this year.

   Since the Taj Mahal opened in April, revenue at Trump
Plaza and Trump's Castle has fallen, compared with a year
earlier. Revenue at the Taj Mahal has also fallen short of
expectations. But Mr. Tracy said reports of the Taj's revenue
results have been unfair because the reports failed to
account for about $16 million of non-casino income.
   Mr. Tracy said he expects as many as 1,100 additional
layoffs at the Taj. He said such layoffs were routine for a
new casino.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump named Gary Selesner president and
chief operating officer of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. Mr.
Selesner was previously acting president and chief operating
officer.
