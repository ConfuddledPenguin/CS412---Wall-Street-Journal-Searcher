   A number of universities are reporting a sharp decline in
the size of this year's freshman classes, signaling the start
of a demographic slide that educators have been dreading for
years.
   The drop-off could put even greater pressure on rising
tuitions, as universities struggle to spread fixed costs
among fewer students. It could also lead to belt-tightening
and staff layoffs, which generally have been avoided despite
a decline in numbers among the college-age population.

   With fewer high school seniors graduating this spring,
many schools are accepting record numbers of students off
waiting lists, while others have extended their application
deadlines from February until as late as August, all in
attempts to salvage pinched budgets.
   "We think demographics are a major factor in all this,"
says David Smith, dean of admissions and financial aid at
Syracuse University in New York, where the incoming freshman
class is expected to drop about 6.4%. But there are other
factors, he says. "Cost is an issue, and so is the general
state of the economy."
   Northeastern University, in Boston, expects 3,000 freshmen
in the fall, 19% fewer than last year, prompting the school
to consider freezing faculty hiring and salary hikes. Oberlin
College, in Ohio, is predicting that about 670 freshmen will
attend, about 21% fewer than a year ago, while the Illinois
Institute of Technology, in Chicago, expects 20% fewer
freshmen, or about 328.
   Some schools, such as Colgate University in New York and
Pepperdine University in California, are expecting larger
freshman classes next year, buoyed by better recruitment
efforts or a surplus of applications. But some of these
increases follow declines last year, and several admissions
officers predict the overall tally this year will be down.
   "The general trend is that people are looking at smaller
freshman classes," says William Conley, dean of undergraduate
admissions at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.
   The trend is affecting both private and public schools.
Michael Barron, director of admissions at the University of
Iowa, says he expects fewer freshmen overall in the large Big
Ten public universities. At Iowa, Mr. Barron expects about
3,162 freshmen next year, a 10% decline.
   The decline in high school graduates has had a lesser
impact on top-tier schools such as Yale University or
Stanford University because applications far exceed available
freshman seats. Still, even the Ivy League's Brown University
expects a decline in incoming freshmen of about 3%. Some
educators contend that the Ivy League and comparable schools
went deeper into their waiting lists this year.
   Educators also say that strong students were accepted by
schools they never expected to get into early in the season.
"This year by June 1, the gig was up. Students knew all of
their options and their options were very good," says Case
Western's Mr. Conley. "In the past, there was some hope of
picking up some stragglers over the summer. This year, we're
not going to see that ebb and flow."
   With numbers down, many schools will face declining
revenue, says John Rouhoniemi, director of admissions at
Saint Olaf College, in Northfield, Minn. "The schools that
are really in trouble are those with small endowments or an
operating budget totally driven by student tuition," he says.
   Because the number of high school graduates isn't expected
to reach last year's level of 2.7 million again until 1997,
many schools may be forced to lay off staff, defer
maintenance and freeze salaries.
   "We're looking to the future with a certain apprehension,"
concedes Mr. Smith of Syracuse. "We see a situation that's
wobbling nationally."
