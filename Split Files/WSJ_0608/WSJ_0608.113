   Easco Hand Tools Inc. holders approved a proposal for
Danaher Corp. to acquire Easco in a transaction valued at
about $170 million. The companies said the merger took effect
yesterday.
   Terms of the agreement, which was initiated in February,
called for Danaher to issue new stock to be exchanged at a
ratio of 0.4175 Danaher share for each Easco share
outstanding. George Sherman, who recently left a senior
executive position at Black &amp; Decker Corp. to become
Danaher's president, said the merged company will have annual
sales of about $1 billion.

tools and specialized automotive-service tools, had sales of
