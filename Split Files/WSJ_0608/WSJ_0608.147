   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp., trying
to squeeze what it can from one of the only potential growth
areas left in the military budget, has realigned its
defense-electronics organization.
   The action won't affect the 16,000 employees in the
sector. But it streamlines the number of divisions that fall
under Rockwell's defense-electronics rubric to five from six,
and the number of individual operating segments to 14 from
17.

   "We're always looking for ways to bring like businesses
together, to build on each other," Kent Black, Rockwell's
executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in
an interview. He said the move was made not to save money per
se, but to allow the company to bid more effectively on
Pentagon contracts and overseas work.
   For example, the segment that makes missile-guidance
equipment will be combined with the shop that designs
navigational gear for submarines, allowing the two to share
similar ideas and technologies. Likewise, units that deal
heavily with computer software will unite.
   The push to regroup defense-electronics apparently was
heightened by several recent contract awards. "It's created
pressure to rationalize some of these things," Mr. Black
said. Among the wins: exclusive production of the Hellfire
missile, which had been shared with Martin Marietta Corp.;
the manufacture of parts for the MX and Midgetman missiles,
which had been handled primarily by Northrop Corp.; and the
integration of a combat system for the Australian navy's new
submarine program.
   Mr. Black also said the company has been notified that it
beat out General Dynamics Corp. for a $150 million pact to
upgrade the avionics on F-111 aircraft for the Australian
government, though the contract award hasn't been officially
announced.
   Rockwell's efforts in the defense-electronics realm mirror
those under way throughout the industry. Electronics is one
of the few parts of the Defense Department budget that might
grow through the mid-1990s, because even if new aircraft,
armored vehicles and ships aren't built, the insides of the
older models will have to be retrofitted.
   As a result, competition is heating up. "A lot of
companies are trying to eliminate their redundancies," said
Chuck Quinn, a marketing executive with United Research, a
consulting firm that works closely with aerospace concerns.
Abeyance, he said, will spell doom.
   Mr. Black said he thinks that Rockwell's
defense-electronics group, which now accounts for about 15%
of the diversified parent corporation's $12.52 billion in
total revenue, could expand slightly in the next few years.
