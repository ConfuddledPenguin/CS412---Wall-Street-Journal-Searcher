   Researchers said they found a gene defect responsible for
an inherited type of kidney failure, an often-fatal problem
requiring dialysis treatments or kidney transplants.
   Researchers at the University of Utah and in Finland said
the inherited defect, called Alport syndrome, is one of the
more common inherited diseases, affecting about one in 5,000
people. It may account for 2,000 of the 100,000 Americans
with kidney failure who must have their blood cleansed
several times a week by expensive dialysis treatments paid
for by a special federal Medicare program.

   The scientists said they expected the discovery to produce
a genetic test that could detect whether relatives of people
with the disease also inherited the gene defect. Early
detection before kidneys begin to fail might make possible
certain drug therapy that can forestall the damage caused by
the faulty gene.
   Moreover, "knowing the exact gene may help to develop
drugs that can treat kidney failure once it occurs, something
we can't do now," said David Barker, one of the Utah
researchers whose report of the finding is published in
today's Science magazine.
   The gene's discovery is a result of scientists' new
ability to map the location of previously hidden genes, a
technology driving an intense world-wide effort to map the
human genome, the entire collection of genes. The Alport
syndrome gene is located on the X chromosome. Each human cell
contains 23 pairs of chromosomes on which all the genes
reside, one of each pair being inherited from each parent.
   The disease is most common among men because they inherit
just one X chromosome, along with a Y chromosome. Women
inherit two copies of the X chromosome. Thus, defective genes
on one copy of the chromosome are often countered by a normal
copy on the other one.
   Researchers in Utah have been searching for the gene
defect since 1949, when doctors at the university's school of
medicine identified a very large family in which the disease
was being transmitted from generation to generation. In the
1950s, Curtis Atkin, a member of the family with the disease,
joined the university's gene hunt. Under his direction, the
researchers located about 35 affected families in the area
with thousands of members.
   In 1988, Mr. Atkin and colleagues reported that by sifting
through the families' DNA, or genetic material, they found a
marker for the gene on the X chromosome. But they still
didn't have the gene itself, nor did they know how it caused
the kidneys to fail. Then, earlier this year, researchers at
the University of Oulu in Finland found most of a gene that
directs cells to make a kidney collagen, a protein that is
part of the kidney's blood-filtering machinery. The gene, it
turns out, is located at the same spot as the marker found by
the Utah investigators.
   In the report in Science, the researchers said they tested
the DNA from 18 of the families and found that people with
the disease were missing fragments of the collagen gene. The
scientists expect to find the altered gene in the rest of the
families, too. The defect apparently causes the slow
deterioration of kidney tissue.
   "It's our belief that many patients with the inherited
form of this disease aren't being properly identified right
now, and that many of their relatives who are at risk aren't
being treated to prevent the disease's onset," said Martin
Gregory, another member of the Utah team.
   The researchers said they will have the test when they
find the entire collagen gene. Right now, they only have part
of it. Doctors believe they can delay the disease's onset
with so-called ACE inhibitors, drugs used for treating
hypertension.
   The research also was conducted by Mark Skolnick, Steven
Gerken and Arnold Oliphant in Utah, and Karl Tryggvason in
Finland.
