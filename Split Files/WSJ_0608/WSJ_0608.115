   Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, a French glassmaker, said the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. will begin an
investigation within 45 days into the merger agreement
between its unit, SG Acquisition Corp., and Norton Co., of
Worcester, Mass.
   Saint-Gobain said that because of the investigation, it
has extended the expiration date of its $90-a-share tender
offer for all outstanding shares of Norton common to June 27.
The offer was scheduled to expire today. As of Wednesday, 8.7
million Norton shares, or about 41% of the shares
outstanding, had been tendered to Saint-Gobain.
