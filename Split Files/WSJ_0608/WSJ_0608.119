   NEW YORK -- Metropolitan Asset Group Ltd. and Lambert
Brussels Real Estate Corp. agreed to buy the assets of U.S.
Shelter Corp., a troubled Greenville, S.C., real estate
syndicator.
   U.S. Shelter is a publicly held property manager and
savings bank owner. It also is general partner in about 150
real estate limited partnerships that own about 220
properties valued at about $700 million, Metropolitan Asset
Group said. Metropolitan Asset said it is difficult to value
U.S. Shelter's partnership interest in the portfolio, but
that it could be as high as $50 million.

   In addition, U.S. Shelter owns Malibu Savings Bank, a
California thrift with about $170 million in assets that
apparently isn't in compliance with new regulatory capital
requirements. U.S. Shelter also has a mortgage banking unit.
   Metropolitan Asset Group is a real estate investment
banking firm. Lambert Brussels Real Estate is the U.S.
investment arm of Pargesa Holding/Groupe Bruxelles Lambert.
   The pact calls for a Metropolitan Asset Group partnership
to provide a $6 million cash infusion into U.S. Shelter.
Also, Lambert Brussels would convert about 40% of its debt in
U.S. Shelter into equity.
   Lambert Brussels is U.S. Shelter's largest creditor, Mr.
Farkas said. Following the purchase, Metropolitan Asset Group
would hold 65% and Lambert Brussels 25% of the equity in the
new company.
   Mr. Farkas said "the reason we're doing this is to create
the largest real estate investment bank and workout entity in
the country." Mr. Farkas said that he envisions the company
"doing a sort of LBO of real estate limited partnerships."
   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors buys a
company in a transaction financed largely by debt.
Ultimately, the group's borrowings are repaid with funds
generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its
assets.
