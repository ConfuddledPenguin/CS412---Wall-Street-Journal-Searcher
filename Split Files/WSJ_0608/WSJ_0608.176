   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved a $250 million loan
to Poland to increase natural-gas production and reduce the
country's dependence on coal.
   The bank said its loan will help finance rehabilitation of
existing gas fields and expansion of gas-transmission and
storage facilities. The European Investment Bank also will
provide Poland with a $60 million credit for the same
projects, World Bank officials said.

   "As Poland moves toward a market economy, demand for gas
and oil is expected to increase, while demand for coal, which
produces large quantities of air pollution, is expected to
decrease," the World Bank said.
   The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, jointly
financed by the World Bank and the United Nations Development
Program, will provide Poland with technical assistance on
pricing gas and setting up a contractual framework to expand
the country's petroleum industry through foreign and domestic
private-sector enterprises.
   In other actions, the World Bank cleared a $190 million
loan to Indonesia to improve public-water-supply facilities
in the Jakarta region, while the International Development
Association, a bank affiliate, approved a $175 million credit
to Bangladesh to strengthen the country's banking and
financial system.
   The bank also approved a $50 million loan to Papua New
Guinea to support economic reforms and help maintain
financial stability in the wake of the closing of the
country's main gold and copper mine.
   In addition, the bank cleared a $32 million loan to
Algeria and a $17 million loan to Tunisia to help finance
agricultural research.
   The World Bank loans will be at variable interest rates,
currently 7.75% a year; the IDA credit to Bangladesh will be
interest-free but will involve administrative fees.
