   PPG Industries Inc. said it agreed in principle to form a
joint venture with France's Essilor International to make
plastic lenses for consumer eyeglasses.
   PPG said it would own 51% of the new company, which would
be based in St. Petersburg, Fla. The agreement, which has
been approved by Essilor's board, must be approved by PPG
directors. Terms of the venture weren't disclosed.

   The new firm would make the plastic lenses, which darken
when exposed to bright light. The product would be sold
exclusively to lens casters for ultimate distribution to
consumers. PPG said such lenses have been available only in
glass.
   PPG said the venture is part of the company's strategy to
generate 40% of total chemicals revenue from specialty
products by 1994. The Pittsburgh maker of glass, chemicals
and coatings said it has invested more than $10 million to
research and develop the new plastic lens, which has been
test marketed under the Transitions trademark since July.
Mass U.S. distribution is planned for 1991, with
international sales expected to begin in 1992.
