   WASHINGTON -- Showing signs of economic uncertainty,
businesses are planning to spend slightly less on plant and
equipment in 1990 than they indicated earlier this year, the
Commerce Department reported.
   Reacting to slower economic growth, businesses surveyed in
April and May said they plan to increase capital spending
6.7% this year, rather than the 7.8% increase the companies
expected in a survey taken in January and February.

   "I don't think the original survey got the right
estimate," said Aubrey Zaffuto, an economist for IBJ Schroder
Bank &amp; Trust Co. in New York. Ms. Zaffuto said she finds the
latest survey results to be a more realistic estimate of 1990
capital spending, based on the sluggishness of the economy.
   According to the latest survey, businesses plan to spend
$507 billion on plant and equipment this year. While that's
less than the earlier estimate of $512.82 billion, it's up
from the $476 billion businesses spent in 1989, which was up
10.4% from the 1988 level.
   Kris Bledowski, senior economist for Cahners Economics,
said the figures show that businesses are uncertain about the
overall strength of the economy. But he said he looks for
industrial production to pick up, which he said will lead to
an increase in capital spending later this year or early
next.
   After adjusting for inflation, planned spending would
increase 5.5% in 1990, compared with a 7.9% rise estimated in
the earlier survey. The revision reflects an expectation of
higher prices as well as a reduction in dollar outlays.
   Manufacturing industries plan to increase capital spending
3.4% in 1990, compared with a 4.9% rise in the previous
survey. Both figures are substantially lower than the 11%
growth in 1989.
   Makers of durable goods, which are big-ticket products
expected to last at least three years, gave the least
optimistic report, saying they plan to increase outlays this
year by only 2.4%. Faced with the current softness in the
automobile industry, motor-vehicle manufacturers plan to
reduce spending 11.3% in 1990. The largest increases are
planned in fabricated metals and nonferrous metals.
   Manufacturers of non-durable goods had a slightly more
promising outlook, planning to increase capital spending by
4.3% in 1990.
