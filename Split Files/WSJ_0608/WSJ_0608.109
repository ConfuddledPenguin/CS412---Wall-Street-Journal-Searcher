   Westinghouse is winning acclaim from savvy money managers
for its recent stock-boosting tactics, including last month's
2-for-1 split and a recently unveiled stock buy-back plan.
   The last time the Pittsburgh-based giant took similar
steps, the stock more than doubled within two years. In the
buy-back of 1984-1986, the company shrank its shares
outstanding by 18%. And the stock, adjusted for splits, rose
from a little above 10 to a 1986 high of 31 1/4.

   Although the latest buy-back will pack less punch --
involving no more than 20 million shares, or about 7% of the
total outstanding -- it's a tonic that has proved potent
before.
   Several money managers view Westinghouse as a rarity in
today's market: a high quality stock that's relatively cheap.
At 37 1/2 yesterday, it sells for less than 12 times the past
12 month's per-share earnings, compared with more than 16
times for the average stock in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.
   Westinghouse's refusal, announced last week, to hide
behind the skirts of Pennsylvania anti-takeover law impresses
Craig Drill, who runs the New York hedge fund Craig Drill
Capital. The typical company, he says, "fights to put moats
around themselves."
   Although Westinghouse hasn't wowed Wall Street for some
time, its stock has provided a total return of better than
25% a year for a decade. "We've owned Westinghouse for about
10 years," says David Dreman, whose Dreman Value Management
holds more than 1.4 million shares. "It has sold below the
market multiple {the average ratio of stock prices to
corporate earnings} the whole 10-year period. But when you
add up the return, it's been about sevenfold."
   Kathleen Millard, who manages the Chase Equity Fund for
Chase Manhattan Bank's private-banking clients, notes that
Westinghouse is selling for a far lower multiple than General
Electric, which trades at around 15 times earnings.
Historically, GE has sold at some premium to Westinghouse,
she says, but "you want to buy Westinghouse when the spread
is wide."
   To be sure, some money managers and analysts are negative
on Westinghouse. Their biggest worry concerns real estate
loans by its finance unit, Westinghouse Financial Services
Inc.
   "Everybody's scared to death about the banks having highly
leveraged transactions exposure," says David E. Nelson of
Investment Counselors of Maryland. "But not many people
realize that {Westinghouse's finance unit} does the same kind
of lending." Investment Counselors sold almost all its
Westinghouse shares recently.
   Commercial real estate lending is 40% of the finance
unit's portfolio, and "nonperforming assets have gone from
7.9% to 15.2% of commercial real estate receivables," says
Michael Bunyaner, analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. The category
includes loans in arrears by 60 days or more, plus real
estate that has been repossessed and isn't yet sold. Many of
the properties are hotels and motels, a category afflicted by
"a great deal of overcapacity." Difficulties in the finance
unit are important, he says, because Westinghouse has relied
on it for a big part of its growth.
   In an interview, Paul Lego, Westinghouse's recently named
chief executive officer, said he considers the finance unit
"an excellent business." Though 1989 was a tough year for
real estate, he said, the unit had record results, and he
expects even better results for 1990.
   However, he says Westinghouse wants to gradually reduce
its real estate portfolio, without dumping properties on a
depressed market. "We have staying power," he said, adding:
"We have the wherewithal to stay with the properties until
the market improves."
   Other money managers are concerned because of
Westinghouse's slow sales growth. But Don Mitchell, chairman
of consultants Mitchell &amp; Co. in Weston, Mass., says sales
growth is slow because Westinghouse has been "very
disciplined about what businesses they keep," jettisoning
those with inadequate profit margins.
   The finance unit is one of six major business groups for
Westinghouse. The other five are broadcasting (20 radio and
five television stations); energy (mostly power-generation
equipment); industrial (including transport refrigeration
systems and electrical products); electronics (mainly serving
the military and the space program); and commercial
(furniture and Longines-Wittnauer watches, among other
things).
   The combined strength of the six units appeals to analysts
such as Candice Eggerss of Morgan Stanley and David S.
Gardner of Nomura Securities. Ms. Eggerss says demand for
Westinghouse's power-generating equipment should grow 10% a
year as utilities scramble to deal with impending energy
shortages in some parts of the country. Mr. Gardner says
recent weakness in the stock is "a perfect buying
opportunity."
