   In one of several recent executive changes, NV Philips
said the last founding-family member in its senior management
is retiring from the company.
   Frans Otten, 55 years old, will step down July 1 as an
executive vice president, the Dutch electronics company said.
Last February, the company announced that Mr. Otten would
leave Oct. 1 to take charge of its relations with the
European Community in Brussels.

   Philips said Mr. Otten decided not to take the Brussels
job for "personal reasons." He was unavailable for comment.
   Walter Grunsteidl, Philips's representative in Brussels,
is moving to Vienna to monitor developments in Eastern
Europe. Philips has made no decision on who will succeed Mr.
Grunsteidl.
   Philips also announced that shareholders will be asked
next month to approve a series of management changes,
including the appointment of Jan Timmer as president,
succeeding Cornelis van der Klugt, who also is retiring.
   Mr. Timmer, in his current post as head of the consumer
electronics division, has improved results in recent years,
the company said, partly because of the rise in compact disk
sales.
