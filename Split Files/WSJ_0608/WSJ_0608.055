   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp., in a symbolically
important step for its expansion into Eastern Europe, said it
has gained a foothold in the Soviet Union's auto industry.
   GM said it bested several competitors to win a five-year
agreement to supply nearly $1 billion of pollution-control
and engine-control parts to Volga Auto Works, or VAZ, the
Soviet Union's largest auto maker. GM said it is also
discussing a possible joint venture with VAZ that would
produce exhaust-scrubbing devices, or catalytic converters,
in the Soviet Union.

   Further, GM executive vice president William E. Hoglund
said the VAZ deal, which had been in the works since last
fall, gives GM an avenue to begin negotiating the purchase of
Soviet platinum. The precious metal is critical to the
manufacture of catalytic converters.
   The Soviet Union has the largest platinum reserves outside
of South Africa, which is subject to U.S. trade sanctions for
its apartheid policies and whose white-minority government
faces an uncertain future.
   Mr. Hoglund didn't provide details about payment
arrangements for the new deal, but he said GM expects to be
paid in dollars. However, he added, that hinges on VAZ's
ability to export the cars outfitted with GM's hardware in
return for hard currency payments.
   Since the Iron Curtain began disintegrating late last
year, GM has moved quickly to establish a presence in the
East bloc, outflanking arch-rival Ford Motor Co. and most
other major auto makers.
   The exception is Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, which has
longstanding and extensive auto alliances with the Soviets as
well as auto makers in Poland and Yugoslavia. Since December,
Fiat has broadened its ties with the U.S.S.R. by signing
agreements to help the Soviets design three new cars and set
up factories capable of building 900,000 cars a year. Fiat
and the Soviets also are discussing building an engine plant
and a foundry to supply those cars. Fiat will be a 30%
partner in the manufacture of one of the subcompact car lines
and expects to sell some of the Soviet-made models in Western
Europe beginning in late 1993 or 1994, according to a Fiat
spokesman in the U.S. Fiat values these deals at about $5.8
billion, the spokesman said.
   GM, meanwhile, has signed an accord to build cars in what
is currently East Germany. It has deals to build cars and
parts in Hungary, and plans by the end of the year to have
distributors and dealers in six Eastern European countries.
   By contrast, Ford last year abruptly pulled out of talks
to build cars in the Soviet Union, a move that prompted a
rebuke from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev during his
U.S. visit last week. Moreover, Ford hasn't announced any new
venture in Eastern Europe.
   Ford executives have said they don't want to jump
prematurely into countries that are still in political
turmoil and that have little in the way of convertible hard
currency and consumer markets that are threadbare at best.
   But GM apparently is willing to join Fiat in gambling on
an East bloc market renaissance.
   At a news conference, Mr. Hoglund made it clear that GM is
as excited about the long-term strategic possibilities of its
Soviet venture as it is of the relatively modest parts deal,
which he described as "essentially a purchase order."
   "How long will it take the Russians to build a consumer
market? Who knows?" said Mr. Hoglund, who is in charge of
GM's world-wide parts operations. "But the first company in
the market would have a better opportunity to participate."
   GM plans to begin shipping catalytic converters,
engine-control computers and fuel-injection systems in 1992
to VAZ's factory in Togliatti, about 700 miles southeast of
Moscow. GM expects to ship parts for between 100,000 and
150,000 cars annually over the five-year life of the deal.
   GM will re-engineer its parts to adapt its systems to
VAZ's 1.5 and 1.7-liter engines and will train Soviet workers
to assemble the pieces in the Fiat-derived Lada cars they
build.
   GM's emissions-control technology could be important to
VAZ's export ambitions as Eastern and Western European
countries move to adopt tighter pollution standards, Mr.
Hoglund said.
   Mr. Hoglund acknowledged that the deal carries some risk.
But he stressed that the 150,000 vehicles-per-year volume is
a tiny slice of GM's overall capacity to manufacture
engine-fuel and exhaust-control systems. GM can make such
systems for five million vehicles a year.
   The "biggest impediment" to the deal's success may be the
tangled logistics of communicating with VAZ's Togliatti plant
from GM's European engineering centers in Western Europe, Mr.
Hoglund said.
   "There are so many unknowns in how you do business" with
the Soviets, Mr. Hoglund said.
