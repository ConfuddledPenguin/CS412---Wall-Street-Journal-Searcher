   WASHINGTON -- The House voted to override President Bush's
veto of an Amtrak authorization bill, moving the issue to the
Senate, where the administration was struggling to find the
votes it needed to uphold the veto.
   In a 294-123 vote, the House brushed aside administration
complaints that one provision of the bill, which authorizes
$2 billion over three years for Amtrak, represents
reregulation of the railroad industry. The Senate is expected
to vote next week.

   After the House action, Senate Democrats yesterday pushed
for a quick vote, saying they were reasonably confident that
they had the necessary two-thirds majority to override the
veto. But Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas objected,
noting that some Republican senators were absent because of
health reasons or family obligations. "We can't do the best
we can with five absentees," he said.
   President Bush has turned back 10 bills, not counting the
Amtrak bill, and so far Congress has failed to override any
of the vetoes. In January, the House rejected his veto of
legislation protecting Chinese exchange students from
deportation, but the Senate upheld the veto.
   In vetoing the Amtrak bill May 24, President Bush
criticized as an unwarranted "regulatory burden" a
requirement that the Interstate Commerce Commission review
proposed acquisitions of major freight railroads by non-rail
companies.
   But some members of Congress believe that Mr. Bush objects
to the federal subsidies in the Amtrak bill, even though
administration officials have said that the president would
sign the legislation if it were stripped of the ICC-review
requirement. House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois
introduced such a measure yesterday.
   A White House spokesman yesterday said, "We're
disappointed by the House vote. The president supports the
Amtrak bill without the ICC provisions."
   During debate on the House floor, Rep. Thomas Tauke (R.,
Iowa), defended the provision, saying, "To say that this is
reregulation of the railroads is just mind-blowing." He noted
that the ICC already has wide authority to review financial
transactions involving railroads and contended that the
disputed provision would simply close a loophole.
   The administration, in recent days, has turned up the
lobbying heat, with mixed results. President Bush called Sen.
Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.) to ask for his support, but Mr.
Hatfield is still undecided. On Tuesday, in a meeting with
Republican senators, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
argued that rail deregulation would be threatened by the
Amtrak bill and pressed for support for the administration.
But the talk deteriorated into a rambling session on airline
deregulation, with several senators voicing complaints.
   Those opposing the president may benefit from Amtrak's
popularity among urban senators of both parties. Moreover,
some senators from rural states have deep concerns about any
corporate takeovers which could threaten rail links to farms.
And though Mr. Dole is counted as loyal to the president on
this issue, some of those closest to him, like Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum (R. Kan.), are opposed to the president's veto.
   Some senators, like freshman Dan Coats (R., Ind.) are
caught in the middle. Sen. Coats, who replaced Vice President
Quayle in the Senate, normally could be expected to support
the White House. But a large number of Amtrak employees, who
are lobbying heavily for the override, live in Indiana. For
now, said an aide, the senator "is completely undecided."
   Because of previous congressional appropriations, the veto
battle, whatever its outcome, isn't expected to affect Amtrak
operations anytime soon.
