   Nynex Corp. said about 4,000 managers agreed to take early
retirement with special incentives as part of a program to
reduce operating costs.
   The White Plains, N.Y., telecommunications company said it
will take a pretax charge of about $41 million in the second
quarter in connection with the program. In the 1989 second
quarter, Nynex earned $279 million, or $1.42 a share, on
revenue of $3.3 billion.

   Although the company expects to realize long-term
operating efficiencies and savings, the program has eroded
corporate earnings significantly. Nynex already has taken
pretax charges of $71 million in the 1989 fourth quarter and
$39 million in the 1990 first quarter in connection with the
retirement program.
   Several regional Bell companies, including U S West Inc.
and Bell Atlantic Corp., have taken similar cost-cutting
steps in recent months. The Nynex early-retirement program
began in January.
   In announcing the program's results late yesterday, Nynex
said about 2,100 managers retired from its New York Telephone
Co. subsidiary, about 900 from New England Telephone Co.,
some 600 from Nynex Service Co., and the remainder from other
parts of the business.
   Nynex shares closed at $88, down 75 cents, in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
   A Nynex spokesman said the early-retirement program will
trim the work force to about 91,900 employees. At the end of
1988, the company employed 97,400 people.
   Industry analysts have considered Nynex's work force among
the most bloated of the Bells, and its financial performance
among the poorest. Of the seven regional companies, Nynex
also has the oldest work force. As of December 1989, the
company's average age for telephone workers was 43.
   According to the plan, retiring managers will have five
years added to their ages and services dates in calculating
their pensions. The company said the five-year base salary
used to calculate pensions was permanently shifted to 1983
through 1987, from 1981 through 1985.
   The incentive plan for managers supplemented a plan for
non-management employees that was offered in late 1989. Nynex
said about 1,500 workers retired under that plan.
