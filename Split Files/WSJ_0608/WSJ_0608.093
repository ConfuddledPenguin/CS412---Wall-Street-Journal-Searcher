   WASHINGTON -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in the
second-largest settlement ever accepted by a commodity
exchange, agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty for
allegedly failing to report violations by four futures firms.
   The settlement reached with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission concludes a 13-count administrative complaint
filed by the agency in January 1987.

   The penalty comes at a time when the agency would benefit
from appearing to be a strong regulator. The Bush
administration is proposing to wrest oversight of stock-index
futures away from the CFTC and grant the power to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. That shift is vehemently
opposed by the commodity regulator, which is backed in the
fight by the commodity exchanges.
   The CFTC said the Merc violated rules requiring exchanges
to tell the agency if a member firm fails to provide
CFTC-required reports. When the four firms didn't comply, the
Merc didn't disclose that, the agency said.
   A spokesman for the exchange said the complaint resulted
from a disagreement over interpretation of CFTC regulations.
   "I think there was honest disagreement over what should or
shouldn't have been reported," Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma
said. "You can't always know exactly what somebody wants, and
our interpretation of what to provide was different than
theirs."
   "The whole purpose of the case," said CFTC enforcement
director Dennis Klejna, "is to drive home the point that the
exchanges have an obligation to inform the commission when
they learn of the inadequacies and we haven't been informed."
   It isn't unusual for the agency to charge exchanges with
failing to follow their own rules, as in this case, he said.
But, "This is the first time we've brought an action against
an exchange for failing to provide notice to the commission"
of firms' deficiencies, Mr. Klejna said.
   The four firms -- CRT Services Inc., Chicago Grain &amp;
Financial Futures Co., Rouse Woodstock Inc. and
ContiCommodity Services Inc. -- failed to make reports
relating to early warning net capital levels, which tell the
agency that the firm might be headed for trouble; major
inadequacies in internal controls; and non-current books and
records, the CFTC said. Financial audits of the firms from
September 1982 to March 1984 showed the problems, the agency
said.
   A CRT Services official said the problem resulted from an
error in a computer program used by the firm that was
immediately corrected. The three other firms have gone out of
business or have been acquired by other commodity-trading
firms since the alleged violations occurred.
   Although no charges have been filed against the firms for
similar reporting violations, both Rouse and ContiCommodity
in recent years have settled CFTC charges of fraud and other
violations, the agency said.
   The Merc, which settled the complaint without admitting or
denying guilt, also agreed to let the CFTC more closely
monitor the exchange's enforcement of its financial
compliance program for two years.
   The Merc's agreement was second in size to the $200,000
settlement by the New York Mercantile Exchange in the early
1980s for problems stemming from the 400-ounce gold contract.
The case resulted in the delisting of the contract.
