   ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands -- Royal Dutch/Shell Group
completed a study on restructuring operations at its Pernis
refinery and will make a decision on whether to go ahead with
the two billion guilder ($1.06 billion) renovation in the
first half of 1991, a company spokesman said.
   Shell spent approximately 2.5 billion guilders upgrading
Pernis with a hydrogen-conversion unit and related
facilities, which produce higher than normal yields of
lighter petroleum products, such as gasolines, from heavier
crudes. Work on the hydrogen-conversion unit, which started
in 1984, ended last year.

   The spokesman declined to specify what new processes or
operations the study called for. But he said the
restructuring at the Group's largest European refinery would
be specifically aimed at reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide
and nitrous oxide and producing lighter products from heavier
crude oils.
   The spokesman declined to confirm whether the switch to
facilities capable of processing heavier oils was a defensive
move aimed at repositioning the refinery ahead of an expected
drop in output of light, low sulfur oils.
   But he did say: "When we look to the far future, we see
that we will have to get heavier oils out of the ground."
   If Shell proceeds with the restructuring, new construction
at the plant would be completed by 1995, roughly five years
before Dutch government-mandated reductions in emissions go
into effect.
   The study envisions reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide
and nitrous oxide from the plant by 70% from 1980 levels.
Current levels are 55% less than 1980 levels.
   Output at the 350,000-barrel-a-day capacity plant won't be
interrupted by the restructuring efforts, the spokesman said.
