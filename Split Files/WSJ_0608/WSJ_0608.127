   Coloroll Group PLC said it went into receivership after
the company was unable to arrange a refinancing strategy with
Candover Investments PLC, a venture capital group.
   Coloroll, a U.K. home fashion and home products concern,
has been involved in talks with Candover since May. Coloroll
issued a strong profit warning in January, as returns from
various operations waned in the wake of a downturn in the
U.K. housing market and consumer spending.

   Accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, the appointed receiver, and
Coloroll weren't available to comment.
   Financial problems have dogged Coloroll for several
months, as the group's ratio of debt to equity rose following
the purchase of John Crowther Group PLC, a British cloth and
carpets maker, in a stock swap for #215 million ($363
million).
   Coloroll planned to sell off several Crowther units, but
they became less attractive as U.K. interest rates rose
before the sales could be put into effect.
   For the six months to Sept. 30, Coloroll reported a 50%
drop in pretax profit to #10.1 million.
