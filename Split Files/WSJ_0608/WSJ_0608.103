   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Lee A. Iacocca, who led Chrysler
Corp.'s comeback in the 1980s, agreed to stay with the auto
maker through the turbulence rocking it in the early 1990s.
   After Chrysler's regular board meeting yesterday, the
65-year-old Mr. Iacocca said he would remain as the auto
maker's chairman and chief executive officer past the
expiration of his contract in December 1991. For several
months Mr. Iacocca has refused to disclose his plans, but the
recent departure of Gerald Greenwald, vice chairman and heir
apparent, prompted the announcement that he would extend his
tenure.

   "When I came to Chrysler, I enlisted for the duration," he
said. "Right now there's a battle raging and I'm not going to
leave my troops in the field."
   Mr. Iacocca left vague exactly how much longer he will
stay. Chrysler officials said his new plans have no end date.
"He will stay until he and the board decide his day-to-day
involvement is no longer needed," a company spokesman said.
   "I've got a responsibility, and I'm going to see it
through," Mr. Iacocca said. "But I want to emphasize that I
have no intention of being carried out of the place."
   Among the tasks Mr. Iacocca said he wants to complete
before leaving is the creation of a clear line of management
succession. He has two obvious potential successors, but both
currently have drawbacks.
   Robert S. Miller Jr. was named Chrysler vice chairman in
the wake of Mr. Greenwald's resignation to lead the employee
buy-out of United Airlines. Mr. Miller is relatively young at
48 years old. He played a crucial role in the Chrysler
bailout by keeping the company's bankers satisfied. But Mr.
Miller has limited experience outside of financial operations
where he has spent his entire automotive career with Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler.
   The other potential successor to Mr. Iacocca is Robert A.
Lutz, 58, president of Chrysler's automotive operations. Mr.
Lutz has wide-ranging experience, including a solid track
record during the mid-1980s as chairman of Ford of Europe, a
huge company in itself. But he has only been with Chrysler
for four years.
   Another top executive, Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of
Chrysler's auto operations, is 62 years old. But Mr. Bidwell
has indicated he may retire early next year, partly because
of health reasons, although it isn't yet certain that he'll
leave.
   Some Chrysler executives say privately that Mr. Iacocca
may have stayed on the job too long and that, despite his
many strengths and forceful presence, the company could
benefit from fresh leadership. But they acknowledge that his
departure would be problematic now, especially from a
public-relations standpoint. That's because Mr. Greenwald was
the third top executive to leave recently -- although the
departures appear quite coincidental.
   Just before Mr. Greenwald left, the company announced that
Vice President and Treasurer Frederick W. Zuckerman would be
leaving soon. But Mr. Zuckerman agreed about four months ago
to leave his post, and the announcement was delayed while he
explored several future opportunities.
   The other recent Chrysler departee was Michael N. Hammes,
vice president of Chrysler's international operations. He
left to join Black &amp; Decker Corp., and Chrysler officials say
he got a significant increase in total pay.
   Despite these separate circumstances, Mr. Iacocca's
decision to extend his stay appears partly designed to
counteract an impression that Chrysler faces a mass exodus
from the executive suite.
   The company's sales have fared poorly in recent months.
Chrysler, which held 11.3% of the U.S. car market in 1988,
claimed 10.3% last year and just 8.9% for the first five
months of 1990. Chrysler posted a record $664 million loss in
last year's fourth quarter.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chrysler rose 12.5 cents a share to $16.125.
