   To Gathers's Memory

   I was most distressed by Charles M. Hart's May 2 letter to
the editor in which he implies that "the young basketball
player who died on the court recently . . ." (meaning Hank
Gathers of Loyola Marymount University) was somehow illicitly
provided $6,600 with which to pay the premium on a
disability-insurance policy.
   The facts are that the decedent arranged financing with a
local bank in a transaction that, I am informed, is not
unique among college basketball players of Mr. Gathers's
quality. If he does not suffer a career-threatening injury
the loan is to be paid off out of the anticipated signing
bonus; but, if he is not signed because of injury, the loan
is paid out of the proceeds of the policy.

   The late and much lamented Hank Gathers, fondly remembered
as "Hank the Bank," was an extraordinary athlete. He was also
an extraordinary human being. He was a senior at LMU and,
like every other senior teammate of his, would have graduated
this academic year. The degree he worked so hard to achieve
(and would receive if alive) will be granted to him
posthumously.
   Hank Gathers was a class human being and he had the good
fortune to have attended a class institution. Neither of them
deserves Mr. Hart's innuendo.
