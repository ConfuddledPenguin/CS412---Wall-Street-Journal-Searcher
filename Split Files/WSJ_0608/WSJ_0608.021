   SHENZHEN, China -- Businessmen, step right up] The
People's Republic of China has just the deal for you.
   In a special one-time offer, the Chinese government is
selling state-owned Xinle Wood Furniture Factory to the
highest bidder, Chinese or foreign. Xinle Wood is a furniture
maker that lost a bundle in 1988 and then a bunch more in
1989.

   There's more. Whoever buys the factory also inherits its
33 employees. For life. That's because when you tap into the
socialist system, you must play by its rules. And
state-employed workers don't get fired, even if there's no
work to do. On a recent afternoon, three of the 33 paid
employees were on the job: two women idly chatting in a
corner and a young man hammering nails into some plywood.
   Still interested? The successful bidder also can continue
Xinle Wood's product line. In fact, according to the rules,
the winning bidder MUST stick to the stuff that got Xinle
Wood where it is today: cheap desks and wardrobes, and bed
frames with headboards sporting two big pink hearts on a
baby-blue background.
   The offer ends soon, so send in those bids. The government
of Shenzhen, a Chinese "special economic zone" bordering Hong
Kong, is hoping to pull in roughly $3 million for the
factory.
   In addition to Xinle Wood, the government is selling three
other struggling state-owned enterprises. There's Xinle Metal
Products Co., also in the red, and two factories barely
breaking even: Xinle Bedding Supplies and Xinle Sofa Co.
   A word of caution: If a bidder's goal is to help hasten
the privatization of China's state-run economy, it's best to
keep that under one's hat. The P-word has become taboo in
China since the lethal suppression of last year's student-led
protest movement in Beijing.
   Nonetheless, the Shenzhen government is touting the
planned sales as a bold new step in China's economic-reform
program. Guo Weiping, the bureaucrat overseeing the sale
offer, calls it "industrial adjustment." Put another way, the
four factories' state-run parent, Shenzhen Decoration &amp;
Construction Industrial Co., gets to dump a handful of money
losers.
   To date, no U.S. company has made a bid since the sale
offer was announced April 23. But Shenzhen is hopeful. "We
definitely welcome U.S. investment," says Mr. Guo, adding as
a tease, "The first companies to jump on such an offer are
sure to succeed."
