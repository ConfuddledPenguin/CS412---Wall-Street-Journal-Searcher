   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., hoping to turn around some troubled
brands in its food division, is expected to unveil soon
several new health-oriented products.
   The trend toward healthier, lighter eating will result in
new product initiatives in its lagging Duncan Hines baking
mixes, said Edwin L. Artzt, chairman and chief executive
officer. "We're not putting Band Aids on the business," he
asserted.

   Instead, Mr. Artzt suggested P&amp;G will introduce a line of
lower calorie, basic mixes, such as brownies and muffins. "We
want to get back to the basics," he said. Consumers have
wanted "better reasons to keep baking."
   P&amp;G has been a "little heavy footed" in developing
healthier formulas for its Crisco brands of shortening and
oil and the baking mixes, "which is unfortunate when you
consider that we're the company that invented olestra," he
said. Olestra, a fat substitute, awaits approval by the Food
and Drug Administration.
   Cincinnati-based P&amp;G is taking these steps to help build
up its food and beverage business, which had a $14 million
pretax loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989. Although
P&amp;G's Folger's coffee and Jif peanut butter are profitable,
the company lost money on its Citrus Hill orange juice last
year.
   The company recently changed the brand's name, formula and
packaging. Mr. Artzt expects sales of the brand's
calcium-added juices to pick up as more clinical studies
confirm the product's effect on building bones.
   Citrus Hill ranks third behind industry leaders Tropicana
and Minute Maid. If it can't be salvaged, Mr. Artzt said he
hasn't ruled out the option of selling it and focusing only
on the fruit drink segment with brands such as its Sunny
Delight and Hawaiian Punch. "That's an option for the
future," he added.
   It's unclear how fast P&amp;G will make that decision,
although Mr. Artzt said he has given the unit a "reasonable
time frame" to fix the problems. But he quickly added: "I'm
not a patient fellow."
   Mr. Artzt said P&amp;G's sharpest growth is coming from hair
care and skin care products, such as Pert Plus, a shampoo and
conditioner, and Oil of Olay, a line of skin lotions. "Most
parts of our business are in some stage of growth with good
global potential," he said. "We don't expect any part of our
business to stagnate in the next decade."
   That growth won't stem from hefty increases in marketing
spending, however. "I have no particular interest in seeing
us increase our investment in marketing," he said.
   Instead, he wants to shift current spending more toward
advertising and less on promotions. While promotions give
short-term volume gains, they can erode consumer loyalty, he
believes. "Sometimes our people are even tempted to believe
that if they don't have particularly strong advertising copy,
it's better not to spend money in advertising," he said. "I
preach the doctrine that halitosis is better than no breath
at all."
   In detergents, P&amp;G sees promise in results of its Phoenix,
Ariz., test market of its super-concentrated detergents, sold
under the "Ultra" Cheer, Tide, Gain and Oxydol brand names.
P&amp;G has expanded the test market to Texas and New Mexico.
   In Japan, those products now account for 80% of the
detergent market, he said. While U.S. consumers say they want
the environmental and convenience advantages of the products,
he doesn't expect domestic sales to go "as far and fast as in
Japan."
   P&amp;G wants to expand its drug and health care business, but
"it's a slower burn deal" because of regulatory clearances
needed. When asked about how P&amp;G will achieve that goal, Mr.
Artzt said "we'll either get there on our own or with the
help of an acquisition."
   Mr. Artzt declined to comment specifically on analysts'
projections for fiscal 1990 earnings, which average about
$4.50 a share. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989, P&amp;G
reported net income of $1.21 billion, or $7.12 a share, on
sales of $21.4 billion. The year-earlier per-share figure is
before P&amp;G's 2-for-1 stock split in November 1989.
   Mr. Artzt did say P&amp;G's rates of growth "are a little
inflated" because of some nonrecurring items in last year's
fourth quarter. The company took a $78 million restructuring
charge and had a higher tax rate in the year-ago fourth
quarter. "Any comparison you want to look at shows our
earnings growth is solid," he said.
   P&amp;G expects to increase its capital spending slightly in
fiscal 1991 and 1992 as it expands capacity at existing
plants and adds facilities. For fiscal 1989, P&amp;G spent $1.03
billion. For 1990, it should continue to be about 5% of
sales, he said.
