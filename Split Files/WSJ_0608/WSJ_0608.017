   BRUSSELS -- Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. provided an
emergency loan to its Fabrique Nationale Herstal unit but
threatened to pull the plug on the maker of Browning rifles
unless a new rescue plan is in place within four months.
   Meanwhile, Generale confirmed that its public offering of
shares in another unit, the mining and metals-refining
company Acec-Union Miniere, had flopped.

   Fabrique Nationale has been one of the main blots on a
largely successful effort by Generale to reinvigorate its
Belgian industrial and financial interests in the two years
since Cie. Financiere de Suez of France acquired 51% of
Generale in a takeover contest.
   Fabrique Nationale, which makes a variety of small arms
and has interests in the making of airplane engines, had a
loss of 2.1 billion Belgian francs ($60 million) for 1989 on
sales of 21.14 billion francs. The loss reflected a
world-wide drop in military spending, huge restructuring
costs, and problems at its aerospace-engine unit, a majority
of which was sold last year to France's Societe Nationale
d'Etudes &amp; de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation.
   For the first five months of 1990, the unit's losses
totaled about 800 million francs, a Generale spokesman said.
   Generale said it would extend 1.5 billion francs of
subordinated loans to allow the unit to continue operating
through September. But Generale warned that it wouldn't be
able to renew its financial support to Fabrique Nationale if
the company fails to obtain an agreement from unions and
other interested parties on a new restructuring plan by the
end of September.
   At the same time, the unit announced the resignation of
its director general, Jacques Germay, saying he "didn't wish
to be associated in the new phase of (Fabrique Nationale's)
life." Mr. Germay couldn't be reached for comment, but an
executive close to the company said his departure apparently
reflected disagreements over strategy.
   Only three months ago, Fabrique Nationale said Mr. Germay
would be part of a three-man executive office heading the
company. The other two members were Joseph Labye, an
industrial consultant who joined Fabrique Nationale this
year, and Albert Diehl, a veteran Fabrique Nationale
executive. Fabrique Nationale said its board named Mr. Diehl
chairman and Mr. Labye chief executive officer.
   In another embarrassment for Generale, its banking
affiliate, Generale de Banque, said investors applied for
45.3% of the two million shares offered in Acec.
   The offering, which ended last week after a three-day
extension, was designed to reduce the holding company's stake
in Acec to about 79.5% from 87.5%. But Generale and its bank
affiliate said they will buy unsold shares, rather than
requiring underwriters of the offering to buy them.
   The offering was priced in mid-May at 4,250 francs a
share.
   Generale's proceeds from the share sale will total around
3.8 billion francs.
