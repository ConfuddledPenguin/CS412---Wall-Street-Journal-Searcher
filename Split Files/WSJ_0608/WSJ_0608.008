   Letters to the Editor:
   A Respected Adviser

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11
</SO>
<LP>
   Clark Clifford has given me astute and honest counsel
throughout most of my 40-year tenure on Wall Street.
   I was therefore greatly distressed to read your May 3
page-one article on the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (for which Mr. Clifford is a lawyer).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For more than 50 years Mr. Clifford has been a respected
adviser and friend to U.S. presidents, regardless of party
affiliation. He has served and upheld the laws of this
country without prejudice.
   Your article twists facts and implicates by innuendo.
