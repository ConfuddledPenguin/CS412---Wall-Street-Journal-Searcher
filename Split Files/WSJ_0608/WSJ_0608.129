   SOUTH AFRICA LIFTED its state of emergency in most of the
country.
   Hoping that the international community will move to end
economic sanctions, President de Klerk announced the repeal
of an array of regulations that gave the government and
police extraordinary powers to curb political dissent through
bannings, detention without trial and press censorship. But
de Klerk said the four-year-old emergency will remain in
effect in Natal province, where violence between rival black
groups is common. It was the latest in a series of moves to
normalize the country's political situation, and was hailed
by Mandela and other apartheid foes.

   KIRGHIZIA APPEARED poised to escalate violence against
Uzbekistan.
   As thousands of Kirghiz massed along the border of the
neighboring republic seeking to avenge 48 deaths in this
week's ethnic clashes, the Soviet interior minister in Moscow
described the situation, sparked by a land dispute, as
"complex," and said it could lead to fighting between the two
republics. A state of emergency was declared in Kirghizia's
capital, where more than 4,000 people surrounded Communist
Party and government buildings, demanding the resignation of
the republic's leaders and urging Kirghiz to unite against
Uzbeks.
   Bush, in his first speech since last week's summit,
praised Gorbachev as "a remarkable man" helping to usher in a
new era in superpower ties.

   Israel's Shamir has formed a narrow hard-line government,
according to a government spokesman in Jerusalem. The
coalition is expected to increase Jewish settlement in the
occupied territories and take a tough stand on peace talks
with Arabs. Israel has had a caretaker government since a
Likud-Labor coalition fell in March.

   Liberia's rebels battled President Doe's forces with
rockets, mortars and automatic weapons at a rubber plantation
25 miles outside Monrovia. The fighting came amid reports
that the insurgents had seized the international airport. The
U.S., meanwhile, ordered more flights this weekend to
evacuate Americans from the West African nation.

   The Warsaw Pact formally abandoned its Soviet-dominated
military structure in Eastern Europe. The 35-year-old
alliance, meeting in Moscow, also committed itself to
democratic change, saying the group would be composed of
"sovereign and equal states." Members also declared their
"readiness for constructive cooperation" with NATO.
                                                                                                       

   Britain's Prime Minister Thatcher told a NATO meeting in
Scotland that the alliance must retain "sufficient nuclear
weapons" in Europe. In Washington, a Bush administration
official, in an apparent hardening of U.S. policy, said
Soviet troops should leave Germany as soon as it is unified,
rather than after a transition period.

   Researchers said blood cells taken from volunteers
immunized with a genetically engineered AIDS vaccine showed
an ability in the test tube to selectively destroy cells
infected with the AIDS virus. The Johns Hopkins University
finding suggests that one type of vaccine may be more
effective than once thought.

   Senate leaders said they will continue efforts to salvage
an omnibus anti-crime bill, after a second attempt to limit
debate on the legislation failed. After private talks,
proponents of the bill said they will try to preserve
provisions that include a three-year prohibition on nine
types of semiautomatic weapons.

   The House voted to override Bush's veto of a bill
authorizing $2 billion over three years for Amtrak. The
lawmakers dismissed administration complaints that a
provision represents reregulation of the railroad industry.
The issue moves to the Senate, where the White House was
seeking support to uphold the veto.

   Tropical forests are vanishing about 50% faster than
previously estimated, boosting concerns about global warming,

report, based on 1987 data, suggested that as many as 50
million acres are cut down yearly, compared with an official
estimate of about 28 million acres.

French-speaking Quebec as a "distinct society."

   East German students rallied outside the Parliament in
East Berlin, demanding higher school stipends. Workers,
