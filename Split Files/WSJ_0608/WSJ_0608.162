   Countless small businesses can't wait to use the Census
Bureau's new Tiger file. But Tiger is proving tough to tame.
   Tiger, a landmark project in demography, is a minutely
detailed computerized map of the entire U.S. When combined
with a data base such as the results of the 1990 census or a
company's own customer files, Tiger gives desktop computer
users for the first time the cartographic equivalent of the
computerized spread sheet.

   Software companies, some run by Census Bureau veterans,
are writing Tiger-based programs that allow small companies
to create "smart maps" on their own computers. Users can ask
various "what if . . ." questions and print out the answers
in map form. Only mainframe computer customers could perform
this trick before, and never with the geographic precision
provided by Tiger.
   Retailers, banks, franchisers, vehicle fleet operators,
marketers, and direct mail houses are excited about the
combined Tiger-census file. So are political consultants and
special interest groups, who see it as a revolutionary way to
approach political redistricting.
   Package delivery companies can use Tiger technology to
figure out the fastest and most efficient routes for their
truck fleets. By juggling population, age and income figures
with geography, retailers can pinpoint on a computer-screen
map the best location for a new store.
   The Census Bureau's computer map is "an amazing product .
. . that has immediate uses," says Stephen Poizner, president
of Strategic Mapping Inc., San Jose, Calif. His company's new
program for PCs, Atlas*Gis, incorporates Tiger.
   But training users in Tiger talk may be more difficult
than originally thought. The Census Bureau provides Tiger
files on magnetic tapes for mainframes and on compact discs
(CD-ROM) for PCs at bargain prices -- $250 for a disc that
maps an entire state -- but the data is tough for the
non-computer professional to digest.
   Viewed by itself, Tiger resembles uncooked spaghetti, a
jumble of random lines and address numbers. "Tiger is 16
billion lines," says Ed Spar, president of New York-based
Market Statistics. "Until you turn those things into
coordinates, and blend them with a mapping software package,
you haven't got much."
   Some purchasers of the first Tiger tapes say they've found
an uncomfortable level of errors in the geographic
information, including erroneous addresses and missing postal
ZIP code numbers.
   The Tiger tapes "are significantly different from what was
promised," grumbles Skip Hunt, general manager of Donnelley
Marketing Information Services, Stamford, Conn. Jeanne
Savage, a manager in the geographic information systems
division of International Business Machines Corp., says Tiger
tapes that IBM has seen vary from "very accurate" to "OK."
   Census enumerators are using Tiger maps in checking
households that didn't send in census forms and are penciling
in corrections. "No map is completely up to date," says
Robert LaMacchia, a Census Bureau assistant division chief
for planning. "Through use, the {Tiger} data will become
current and represent what's actually on the ground."
   "There's going to be a whole industry that's going to take
Tiger, improve it, and resell it at a premium," adds
Donnelley's Mr. Hunt. Mr. Poizner says he expects "a ton of
competitors," as the concept of desktop mapping becomes
better known.
   Tiger's formal name is the Topologically Integrated
Geographic Encoding and Reference file. It's an ambitious,
seven-year, $200 million project that lists in digital form
every highway, street, bridge and tunnel in the 50 states.
Each city block or stretch of country road carries its own
range of addresses. In scope and level of detail, Tiger and
its associated computer programs stand alone in the desktop
mapping arena.
   Software companies are scrambling to take advantage of
this statistical mother lode. "It looks like the government
opened up a big oil field," says Don Cooke, president of
Geographic Data Technology, Lyme, N.H., who helped compile
Tiger when he worked at the Census Bureau. Mr. Cooke says the
Detroit-based data firm R.L. Polk is paying his company $3
million "to clean up Tiger and make it work for direct mail."
   Mr. Cooke thinks there's also a payoff in programs that
help delivery services get better productivity from their
vehicles. "Everybody running a big truck fleet is looking at
this technology," he says.
   Routing Technology Software Inc., Vienna, Va., markets
software called Roadshow. It ponders the number and location
of orders received by a company, then divides the day's
deliveries between vans, laying out the sequence of stops and
the most efficient route to drive. Tiger, "in its present
form, is probably too tough to use so there's an opportunity
for companies like ours to predigest it," says Donald Soults,
Routing Technology's president.
   Even the watered-down version can be intimidating. "I
can't even explain it to you, and I've seen it three times,"
says Richard Orloff, marketing manager for the Asbury Park
Press, an afternoon newspaper in central New Jersey. The
newspaper uses Roadshow to deploy its circulation trucks.
   Fred Barber, research demographer in the Washington
consulting firm Matthew Greenwald &amp; Associates, warns that
Tiger is untested in the marketplace and complex for the
average PC user. "Small businesses, retailers and
distributors who can get on top of this are going to have a
competitive advantage. But I think the learning curve is
going to be a bit steep."
   Computer hardware may be a problem. Tiger programs require
more computer capacity than some small businesses possess.
And the price of software that can be linked to Tiger could
come as a shock to the entrepreneur who is used to paying
$400 for a sophisticated spread sheet. "You're talking about
$2,500 for a piece of software that doesn't even include
Tiger data," says Joe Francica, commercial applications
manager for Tydac Technologies Corp. of Ottawa.
   But Strategic Mapping's Mr. Poizner says: "I'm shocked if
anyone thinks price is an issue. If you're building a new
store, you're talking $1 million in real estate and
construction costs."
