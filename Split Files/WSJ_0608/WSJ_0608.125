   Calgene Inc., an agricultural biotechnology concern based
in Davis, Calif., said it will incur a "significant" one-time
charge in its third quarter ending June 30, citing layoffs
and severance payments, and a greenhouse closure in
consolidating sites.
   A spokesman said an estimate of the charge wasn't
available. In the year-earlier quarter, Calgene had a net
loss of $1.7 million, on revenue of $8.1 million.

   Calgene also said that this year, it will change its Sept.
30 fiscal year end to June 30, a time of seasonally low
activity in agriculture, when accounting relating to
inventory and other factors is easier and less expensive than
in September.
   Calgene said it has stopped development programs in
genetic engineering of certain plant hybrids and of alfalfa,
and laid off 35 employees, or about 11% of the total work
force, from those programs last week. These moves and the
closure of one of Calgene's three greenhouse operations are
aimed at focusing the company on its core projects of oils
modification, development of cotton that isn't damaged by
herbicide, and creation of improved-quality tomatos. Calgene
said the actions will reduce expenses by at least $3 million
annually.
