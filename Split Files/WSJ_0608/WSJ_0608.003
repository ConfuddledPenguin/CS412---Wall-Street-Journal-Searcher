   Medinah, Ill. -- Medinah Country Club was founded by
Shriners, an offshoot of the Masonic movement whose idea of
fun involved things Levantine, if not elephantine. In the
1920s, when they built a three-golf-course playground in this
western suburb of Chicago, they gave it a clubhouse with a
dome like a mosque, carved camel-shaped sand traps into
fairways (one survives), and affixed a sign reading "Allah Be
With You" to the exit side of the front gate.
   Next Thursday, when the U.S. Open golf tournament tees off
in this piece of the Middle East in the Middle West, the
competitors may find themselves wishing the sign were turned
around. They'll need all the help they can get before they
enter the place.

   In Medinah's No. 3 Course, golfdom's sheiks will be facing
a course that has daunted their fellows for decades. Anyone
coming here with notions of parboiling par will have fizz in
his fez, and thoughts of scores deep into the 60s are
downright Saheresy. Red numbers on the leader boards should
be as rare as Red Label in Riyadh, birdies as scarce as
springs in the Sinai, eagles as elusive as . . . OK, I'll
quit.
   But you get the idea. Two other U.S. Opens have been held
here -- in 1949 and 1975 -- and nobody broke the then-par of
284 over 72 holes in either. The course was extensively
altered in 1986, but lost none of its sting. When it hosted
the U.S. Senior Open in 1988, the average 18-hole score in a
field that included such olden goldies as Gary Player, Arnold
Palmer, Bruce Crampton and Bob Charles, was 78, more than six
shots above the new par of 72.
   A story has it that a bedraggled Senior Open contestant,
whose identity changes with the telling, asked a marshal on
one hole to point out the ladies' tees. "You're playing 'em,"
the marshal replied. The course for that event was charitably
set at 6,881 yards, 314 shorter than it will play next week.
   The really interesting thing is that Medinah's members can
-- and sometimes do -- play No. 3 longer than the U.S. Golf
Association, which sponsors the Open, has decreed for the
tournament; it measures 7,366 yards from the way-back tees.
Additionally, Medinah had to widen a couple of fairways for
the fest at the USGA's request, took a nasty hump out of one
green and trimmed many of the layout's 10,000 or so trees.
   The course that will be golf's Mecca next week originally
measured a modest 6,215 yards, and was designed for women
members of the club. Its architect was Chicagoan Tom
Bendelow, whose main reputation was for productivity; he put
his signature on about 650 courses in a 30-plus year career,
staking some layouts in a single day.
   Bendelow took more time with Medinah No. 3, and it is
regarded as his jewel, but this could have been inadvertent
because it was immediately apparent that it was too tough for
its intended users. The club turned over another of its
courses to the ladies, and began lengthening and
strengthening No. 3 for championship play.
   That they did well was attested by the winning scores in
the three Western Opens and two U.S. Opens played here, the
best being Jackie Cupit's 281 in the 1962 Western. Cary
Middlecoff, the golfing dentist, put first- and last-round
75s around a 67 and 69 to win the '49 Open at 286 by a stroke
over Sam Snead and Clayton Heafner. In 1975, Lou Graham and
John Mahaffey tied for the 72-hole lead at 287 after several
better-known players, including Jack Nicklaus and Ben
Crenshaw, played themselves out of contention on the last
nine holes. Graham captured the 18-hole playoff, 71-73.
   Before it could land this year's Open, though, Medinah had
to meet a USGA demand that it build a new 18th hole that
could accommodate the big grandstands modern professional
golf requires. The club wound up spending $1.2 million on a
thorough-going renovation that scrambled several holes on its
back nine, changed the 14th hole from a 326-yard par four to
a 545-yard par five, and added a new 17th hole as well as a
new 18th.
   Everyone claims to be delighted with the changes with one
exception -- their effects on the former 17th hole. This is
the heavily trapped, across-water par three that has been
called one of the toughest single-shot holes in golf. Snead
bogeyed 17 in the final round of the 1949 Open to foreclose
what would be his last strong chance at the one major title
that always eluded him, and Crenshaw dunked his tee shot into
Lake Kadijah there (named for Mohammed's wife) to spoil his
'75 bid.
   Old 17 is the 13th hole of Medinah's rebuilt back nine,
and still is formidable. But position counts in golf as in
life generally, and it probably won't be as pivotal in the
tourney's outcome this time around.
   Medinah No. 3 fits the pattern of recent U.S. Open courses
in that it's very long (7,195 yards) with smallish, very fast
greens, and its tree-lined fairways will put an additional
premium on driving accuracy. According to host-pro Mike
Harrigan, it also deserves respect for subtlety.
   The three holes Harrigan picks as the layout's toughest
share that characteristic. No. 12, a narrow, 462-yard par
four, has water hard on the right, but he suggests that
players cling to that side nonetheless because it affords
superior access to the green. At the 199-yard, par-three
13th, the nasty former 17th, the lake often frightens players
into using too much club, but Harrigan counsels against this
because it's better to miss short of the steeply
back-to-front sloping green than into the big trap behind it,
facing (aaargh]) downhill.
   The last of Harrigan's terrible trio is 16, a wooded,
436-yard par four that's a sharp dogleg left. Big hitters, he
says, will be tempted to fly some trees and cut the dogleg,
but that's a no-no because "from the tee you can't see the
trees behind the trees." Play right, use a longer iron second
shot, and take a par any way you can get it, he advises.
   "In fact," he adds, "that last point's good advice on any
hole here."
