   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill
to reregulate cable television after a compromise reached
with the industry unraveled over antitrust and competitive
issues.
   The legislation, which passed 18-1, still faces many
hurdles, including the threat of a full-court press by big
cable operators to kill it. But the cable industry's
withdrawal from the compromise not to oppose the measure
strengthened many lawmakers' resolve to rein in the industry.

   The legislation sets up a basic tier of cable service that
consists of public-access channels and local broadcast
signals, and it requires cable systems to carry local TV
stations. Rates for the basic service would be regulated by
municipalities when local cable operators don't face
competition from other multichannel providers such as another
cable system, wireless cable service or direct broadcast
satellite service. Guidelines for regulation would be
established by the Federal Communications Commission.
   Under the legislation, the FCC can step in and regulate
rates for satellite service, such as Cable News Network and
ESPN, only if it acts on a complaint of excessive rate
increases. Further, the bill would direct the FCC to set
limits on the number of subscribers for any one cable
company, and to cap the number of channels that can be used
by programmers that are wholly or partly owned by the cable
operators.
   The legislation also says that cable programmers that are
owned wholly or in part by multisystem cable operators can't
"unreasonably refuse" to make programming available to
companies that compete with cable operators. The industry and
the committee parted company over that provision. The
industry wanted language in the bill to make clear that
exclusive programming is a legitimate business strategy. It
also wanted to be able to decline to provide programming to
competitors unless required to do so under current antitrust
laws.
   The National Cable Television Association, which earlier
in the week reached an agreement with key senators that it
wouldn't oppose the bill, reversed course after committee
leaders refused to change the legislative draft. Yesterday,
Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) placed blame squarely on the
cable industry, accusing it of demanding at the last minute a
"special carve-out" from antitrust law.
   On a voice vote, the committee strengthened the language
stating that cable programmers with financial ties to cable
operators can't "unreasonably refuse" to sell programming to
competitors. It specifically added a reference to direct
broadcast satellite and backyard satellite dishes to the list
of competitors. And in a further slap to the cable industry,
the committee removed its "finding" that exclusivity is a
legitimate business strategy.
   Stephen Effros, president of the Community Antenna
Television Association, said the cable industry will "very
strongly oppose" the legislation. "We're willing to compete,
but these guys want us to give competitors our product," he
said. "The bill's language forcing us to make our products
available to others was murky, and we said: `Look, this has
got to be clear. There is no deal if we cannot protect our
programming.'"
   NCTA President James Mooney was more circumspect. He
called the bill "a considerable improvement" over earlier
proposals, but he added that it "goes too far and we must
oppose it." He said his organization would continue to work
toward "reasonable" legislation in both houses, but that it
"cannot accept legislation that hampers the ability of our
industry to continue to grow and to serve our customers."
   Lawmakers have been under considerable pressure from
constituents, who have complained that monthly bills have
skyrocketed since 1987, when rates were largely deregulated
under the 1984 Cable Act. Many members in both the House and
Senate would like to pass cable legislation before the
November elections. Meantime, the FCC, which would pick up
much of the authority for developing guidelines and enforcing
them, plans to present a package of proposals on the cable
industry and competition this summer.
   In a move that could help the efforts of telephone
companies to enter the cable industry, the committee said it
would hold hearings this summer and vote on a separate bill
sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.). The committee,
however, widely viewed the controversial Burns measure as a
"killer amendment" that could torpedo the entire bill.
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer
Federation of America and a longtime opponent of telephone
company entry into the cable business, said the last-minute
maneuver by the cable industry gives the Burns proposal some
momentum as lawmakers seek strong competitors to cable.
"Cable companies," he said, "have now shown that they deserve
the phone companies as their adversaries."
