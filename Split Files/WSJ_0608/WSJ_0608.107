   A presidential commission studying how the legal system
could best cope with massive litigation resulting from a
nuclear disaster has outlined a plan for compensating
victims.
   The Presidential Commission on Catastrophic Nuclear
Accidents is expected to present a draft of its proposal to
President Bush within the next two weeks. The plan is
expected to be submitted to Congress on Aug. 20.

   According to a nearly final draft of the report, the
Commission recommends that all state and federal claims be
consolidated in one federal court. That court would then make
general findings such as who is responsible for the accident
and what injuries could be directly traced to the incident.
The court would also establish a standardized system of
paying for different types of claims, such as personal injury
or property damage.
   Further, the report calls for awarding compensation on the
basis of the urgency of the victims' needs. Those with
immediate medical and housing needs would get paid first.
Death claims, property devaluations, and reimbursement to
cities for ambulance and evacuation costs, fall into a
secondary category.
   One of the most complicated aspects of compensating
victims of mass disasters is deciding to what degree an
injury or illness might have been caused by the accident. The
Commission's solution is a sliding scale of compensation
based on the likelihood of causation.
   If an individual who fought a fire resulting from the
nuclear accident developed leukemia, he or she would receive
100% of the claim. A person 80 miles downwind from the
accident might receive only a percentage of the claim. If an
individual with no symptoms remains fearful, the potential
victim would be eligible for free medical monitoring.
   The commission, chaired by Steven C. Griffith Jr., the
senior vice president of Duke Power Co., was created in 1988
as part of the reauthorization of a 1957 bill known as the
Price-Anderson Act. The Act effectively allows for a federal
insurance program to compensate victims of a nuclear accident
as if it were a natural disaster. The original ceiling on
liability was $560 million, a figure equal at the time to the
total of private nuclear insurance and government indemnity
available to pay public liability claims.
   The reauthorization bill raised the limit to $7.3 billion
and established the Commission to decide who would get the
money and how it would be distributed.
   Commission members heard testimony from nuclear insurers
and plaintiffs attorneys involved in the Three Mile Island
accident, from scientists with expertise on the Soviet
nuclear accident at Chernobyl, as well as legal experts on
mass disaster litigation.
   Stanley Chesley, a plaintiffs attorney in Cincinnati who
has not seen the report, was critical of the two-tiered
compensation plan. "If the money is available, there should
not be two stages," he said. "Those people at the bottom will
never see justice."

   USE OF WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS restricted by Texas Supreme
Court.
   The Texas court said a written disclaimer in a sales
contract "must be conspicuous to a reasonable person."
Writing for the court, Justice Lloyd Doggett said a
disclaimer included in text that is "undistinguished in
typeface, size or color" doesn't qualify unless the buyer had
"actual knowledge" of it. Another court member, Franklin
Spears, called on the state legislature to abolish
implied-warranty disclaimers.
   Courts have for years upheld implied warranties, under
which makers and sellers of goods are presumed to guarantee
the quality of their products. However, many state laws also
permit businesses to disclaim such warranties in their sales
contracts as long as buyers are put on notice. Whether the
notice is sufficient is a question that often sparks
litigation.
   Cate's Transmission Service, a Texarkana, Texas, business
had brought the suit, alleging breach of implied warranty
against Dover Corp., a New York company which made three
vehicle lifts purchased by Cates. The plaintiff said the
lifts never worked, but two lower courts summarily dismissed
the case, upholding Dover's claim that the suit was barred by
a disclaimer in the sales contract.
   The Supreme Court said the disclaimer wasn't conspicuous
enough and sent the case back for trial.

   JUDICIAL NOMINEES' membership in discriminatory clubs is
debated.
   Some Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are
pushing for a resolution that would brand as "inappropriate"
any federal judicial nomination of a person belonging to a
discriminatory club.
   The proposed nonbinding resolution was opposed by
conservative Republicans during a committee hearing. "We must
not focus on one issue, the club issue," said the ranking GOP
member, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. But he added, "I
oppose discrimination in any form."
   Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) labeled the Democratic
resolution "a litmus test" that would be hypocritical because
some of the senators themselves belong to clubs that exclude
women and nonwhites. Thomas Boyd, the Justice Department's
director of policy development, said after the hearing that
the agency agreed with the intent of the two-page resolution
but that its wording was ambiguous and required refinement.
   The judiciary panel is expected to vote on the highly
unusual resolution within the next few weeks. The outcome is
uncertain, although Democrats have already received support
from Sen. Arlen Specter, a politically moderate Republican
from Pennsylvania.
   The issue of discriminatory club membership has cropped up
repeatedly in confirmation hearings, including those of
Justice Anthony Kennedy and the Justice Department's civil
rights chief, John Dunne. Both Mr. Dunne and Mr. Kennedy quit
exclusionary clubs in connection with their nominations.
   Proponents of the resolution contend that important
business is conducted at private eating and sports clubs.
Exclusionary practices "deny women and minorities a full and
fair opportunity to participate in the economic life of their
communities," said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), the
resolution's prime sponsor along with Sen. Howard Metzenbaum
(D., Ohio).
   Representatives of women and minority professionals
testified strongly in favor of the resolution. But members of
some all-male organizations called the provision intrusive.
   Reno Menapace, an Ohio lawyer speaking on behalf of the
Loyal Order of Moose, said that membership in that all-male
organization shouldn't "be viewed as a tacit endorsement of
discriminatory practice." He said the order has an auxiliary
called Women of the Moose.

   TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES sue AT&amp;T over 900 number.
   Mirage Studios, creator of the popular comic-book
characters that were the basis of a movie, is seeking damages
of $105 million from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Phone
Programs Inc., SBK Records Group and WPIX Inc. The suit,
filed in federal court in New York, claims the 900 number,
which charges callers $3 to listen to a daily recording about
turtle superheroes, is "strictly a rip-off" of the trademark.
The recordings unlawfully use terms such as "Turtle Power"
and "Cowabunga," associated with the trademark, the suit
said.
   The suit said SBK of New York was granted the right to
sell the movie soundtrack, but not to provide a 900 number.
It seeks a court order banning AT&amp;T from billing customers
for the service and demanding that the number be
disconnected. In the suit, Mirage said AT&amp;T and the other
defendants have ignored requests to halt the service.
   A spokesman for AT&amp;T said the company hasn't seen the
suit. "We will look at the claims closely and see if they are
justified," he said.
   WPIX, a New York TV channel, is named as a defendant for
allegedly broadcasting commercials promoting the number.

   CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER RESIGNS from American Bar
Association.
   Jill Wine-Banks resigned as the highest staff member at
the ABA. Ms. Wine-Banks, a former Watergate prosecutor and
general counsel to the U.S. Army, said she will remain with
the ABA until a successor is named. She was the first woman
named to the post and has served for three years.
   According to one source at the ABA, Ms. Wine-Banks had
disagreed with the group's board of governors last month over
her compensation. But Ms. Wine-Banks denied that. "Salary had
nothing to do with this," she said, adding that she has long
thought about leaving and had other professional
opportunities available to her.
   "We accept Jill's decision with regret, and look forward
to having her back among us as a lawyer and an active ABA
member," said ABA president L. Stanley Chauvin Jr., of
Louisville, Ky.
