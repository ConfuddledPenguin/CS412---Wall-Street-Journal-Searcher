   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Urcarco Inc., an operator of Texas
used-car lots, said that it is negotiating with its lead
bank, NCNB Texas National Bank, to increase its credit line
to about $100 million from $45 million, and that it is
discussing the possibility of selling notes based on its
auto-note portfolio and of beginning to sell commercial
paper.
   The company has a healthy appetite for cash, because it
purchases used cars for cash and then provides financing for
the cars when they are resold.

   Urcarco said that it raised $108.4 million last week from
an offering of 5.8 million common shares, and that it has
about $125 million in cash and available bank credit lines. A
spokesman said the company hopes to have "a full array of
other types of debt underlying the equity," which now is more
than $200 million.
