   WASHINGTON -- President Bush's summit meeting with Mikhail
Gorbachev had hardly begun when the cries arose: Mr. Bush was
selling out by making concessions on strategic arms and by
signing a trade pact without forcing an end to the Kremlin's
crackdown on Lithuania.
   The drumbeat of criticism is coming mostly from
conservatives, led by former Pentagon officials Richard Perle
and Frank Gaffney, who has an active fax machine and
extensive contacts in the press. Some liberals, such as
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), have
picked up some of their points.

   But a closer look at the arms and trade moves suggests
that Mr. Bush didn't give away nearly as much as the attacks
suggest, according to analyses not only inside the
administration but by outside analysts. In some cases Soviet
benefits are illusory and in others the U.S. seems to be the
clear winner. Accordingly, the political dangers to Mr. Bush
may be considerably less than would be the case if there were
a full-scale conservative attack. "In the immediate
post-summit climate, the attacks are meaningless," says Kevin
Phillips, a Republican political theorist.
   The summit did fail to advance Mr. Bush's key
foreign-policy goals: unifying Germany in the West and
rolling back Soviet troops in Europe.
   But on strategic-arms control, the treaty nearing
completion will be lopsided in most respects in favor of the
U.S. And on Lithuania, Mr. Bush has shifted to a strategy of
using congressional pressure to force Mr. Gorbachev into
easing his crackdown before the pact is ratified. That
ensures that months, at least, will pass before real trade
benefits flow to Moscow.
   "On START {the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty}, we got
most of the restrictions we were looking for," maintains
Michael Mandelbaum, an analyst at the Council on Foreign
Relations. And on Lithuania, says Rep. Jim Leach, an Iowa
Republican, Congress is "making very clear that the Baltics
matter," leaving Mr. Bush free to avoid "backing Gorbachev
into a corner from which there is no maneuverability."
   Among those who disagree, the drumbeat of criticism began
the week before the summit, when Secretary of State James
Baker went to Moscow to settle key arms-control provisions
that made up the joint summit statement on strategic weapons.
   In the following days, influential conservative
commentators blasted Mr. Baker for caving in to Soviet
demands. Actively pushing the attack is the Center for
Security Policy, a small think tank run by Mr. Gaffney, an
informed and articulate conservative who was a top Pentagon
arms-control official from 1983 to 1987. Mr. Gaffney has
established a reputation for quickly providing journalists
and analysts with pointed commentary on foreign-policy
issues.
   The center's final judgment on the Washington summit
accused Mr. Bush of making "the worst strategic
miscalculation on the part of a president of the United
States since the Yalta conference of 1945," when Franklin
Roosevelt agreed to a Soviet sphere of influence in Europe.
   Columnists William Safire and Rowland Evans and Robert
Novak, and an editorial in this newspaper, all complained.
The conservative Washington Times carried a banner headline
declaring: "Baker `sellout' in arms talks feared." Mr. Perle
strongly sounded the same charges in commentaries before,
during and after the summit.
   Some lawmakers echo the complaints about Lithuania, with
Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas warning after
the summit that "if the Lithuania or the Baltic problem isn't
resolved, then I think it will become a matter of great
concern."
   In an interview, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) concedes
congressional conservatives haven't raised much of a ruckus
so far about the arms-control deals. But he called the recent
arms concessions "a serious error that will tie us down on
military technology." He said "it's arms control as a
political process, not a strategic process," adding that "the
administration has decided that there is but one overriding
U.S. national interest, and that is Gorbachev's survival.
They're willing to subordinate all other goals to that."
   On arms control, the critics have many gripes but have
zeroed in on two key issues: long-range cruise missiles,
where the U.S. has an edge; and "heavy" multiple-warhead,
land-based, ballistic missiles, where Moscow has a monopoly.
   The critics charge that, by agreeing to an upper limit of
880 sea-launched cruise missiles, Mr. Bush wrote off a major
U.S. advantage, and tempted Congress to cut the programs.
   But the deal worked out by Mr. Baker in Moscow, and
sanctioned at the summit, actually meets an American demand
that sea-launched cruise missiles be excluded altogether from
the legally binding treaty limits and verification
procedures. Instead, they are to be covered only by
"politically binding declarations" in which each side will
merely state how many it will build. In return, Mr. Baker --
with Pentagon and White House concurrence -- agreed that the
U.S. wouldn't declare an intention to build more than 880 of
the weapons, well above the total of 758 the Navy says it
needs.
   On air-launched cruise missiles, fired from the wings of
bombers, the critics lambaste the administration for agreeing
to count all such weapons with a range of more than 600
kilometers and for making promises about a new conventional
cruise missile code-named "Tacit Rainbow."
   But the U.S. actually won the right to exclude as many as
1,500 of the weapons from treaty limits vs. 840 for the
U.S.S.R. And Mr. Baker managed to exempt the exotic "Tacit
Rainbow" missile merely by stating that the Air Force only
plans a nonnuclear version.
   On heavy missiles, the critics complain that the U.S. has
agreed that some modernization of the Soviets' huge SS-18
will be permitted. They contend that by upgrading the SS-18s,
Moscow could fully offset cuts in the number of missiles.
   But the treaty as it stands would slash the SS-18 force in
half, from 308 missiles to 154. And no amount of improvement
is likely to offset that cut, according to former defense
secretary Harold Brown, because nuclear-war planners
generally seek to aim two warheads at each target. Further,
the U.S. is still pressing to effectively cut off further
SS-18 modernization after 1992.
   Overall, experts estimate that the treaty will widen the
U.S. lead in nuclear warheads and deprive Moscow of its
historic edge in ballistic missiles.
   On the trade issue, there isn't any doubt that Mr. Bush
gave Mr. Gorbachev a symbolic political prize by signing the
trade pact while the Kremlin is still squeezing Lithuania.
But in more substantive terms, Mr. Bush has made it clear to
the Soviets that he won't send the trade deal to Congress for
approval, and won't take the related step of granting the
Soviets most-favored-nation trade status, until the Soviet
legislature passes a new law guaranteeing Soviet Jews
expanded rights to emigrate.
   Beyond that, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker drove home to the
Soviets the need to keep the trade pact from becoming
entangled in a fight with Congress over Lithuania. To make
the point, Mr. Bush used a congressional action he initially
didn't like: a May 1 Senate resolution declaring that the
president shouldn't even bother sending Congress a new trade
deal for approval until the Kremlin's economic crackdown on
Lithuania is eased.
   As a result, both U.S. and Soviet officials suddenly find
it convenient to put off implementing the trade pact. Soviet
officials now are hinting that passage of their new
emigration law, the next step in the process, won't occur
until at least September. In the meantime, U.S. officials
hope that, by dangling a signed but unactivated trade treaty
before Mr. Gorbachev's eyes, they are giving a positive
incentive to get moving by then on Lithuania.
   By giving Congress the bad-cop role, Mr. Bush has let
others tie trade to the Baltics while avoiding formal linkage
that might rear its head again and again as ethnic issues
boil up in the future. Some think that's useful in the long
run. "I think we ought to think twice before we tie our
economic relationship to the Soviet Union to the satisfaction
of each and every grievance" by ethnic groups, says Mr.
Mandelbaum.

   Under the likely terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty currently being negotiated, the Soviet warhead total
is estimated to fall about twice as much as the U.S. total by
the late 1960s.
