   NEW YORK -- Schering-Plough Corp.'s accord to sell its
Maybelline cosmetics business to MBP Acquisition Corp.
collapsed, but the drug maker entered a new agreement to sell
it to leveraged buy-out specialist Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co.
   The sale price is unchanged at $300 million.

   At the same time, Wasserstein Perella announced that it
closed the acquisition of the Yardley/Lentheric cosmetics
lines from SmithKline Beecham PLC for #110 million ($185.6
million).
   Schering and MBP were tight-lipped about the reason their
agreement, announced in April, fell through, but analysts
speculated that financing may have been an issue. MBP
includes Playtex Family Products Corp. of Stamford, Conn.,
the Boston buy-out firm Thomas H. Lee Co., and members of
Playtex and Maybelline management.
   Some insiders expressed surprise at the rapid demise of
the deal with Playtex, which began to unravel last week. But
Wasserstein apparently was poised to step in. An insider
involved in the deal said Wasserstein participated in early
rounds of the bidding and already had done its homework on
Maybelline, the nation's second-largest maker of cosmetics
sold through mass merchandisers.
   Schering, Madison, N.J., put the cosmetics company on the
block in December, saying it wanted to focus on its more
profitable prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical
lines.
   Analysts had called $300 million a low price; the figure
about equals Maybelline's 1989 sales. Allan Mottus, a
cosmetics industry consultant, said: "I still think it's a
good company at a good price." For 1990's first quarter,
Schering's cosmetics business, almost all of which is
Maybelline, posted a sales drop of 1.8%, to $59.6 million
from $60.7 million the year earlier.
   Mr. Mottus says Yardley "is a major player in the U.K.
market in makeup and skin care" but "doesn't have a strong
distribution in the U.S.," which can be remedied with
Maybelline's strong presence.
   Robert B. McKeon, co-president of Wasserstein Perella
Management Partners Inc., an arm of the parent, said that
Maybelline has 400 U.S. salespeople and Yardley has 10. In
the U.S., "Yardley has 71% brand-name recognition but only
$15 million" of the brand's $200 million world-wide sales,
Mr. McKeon said.
   In addition, "the {Yardley} name has been dormant since
the late '60s and early '70s. Even if you do {only} a decent
job of bringing the name back, you should be able" to exceed
the $15 million figure here. Mr. McKeon added that in the
U.S., Yardley items currently are sold largely in specialty
shops and Wasserstein will be aiming to place them in the
larger drug chains and retailers as well.
   Mr. McKeon said Wasserstein Perella has put together "a
very conservative capital structure" for Maybelline, using no
junk bonds. The financing involves "substantial" equity,
which he wouldn't specify, and bank debt.
   "Over time, we'll refinance the two companies together in
a holding company," providing a vehicle for acquisitions, he
said. Mr. Mottus, the consultant, suggested that at some
point, Wasserstein Perella might consider making a public
offering in such a cosmetics business.
   The Maybelline transaction is subject to approvals
including antitrust clearance. Wasserstein Perella is
expected to retain the current managers of Maybelline and
Yardley and to offer them equity holdings in the newly
acquired companies.
