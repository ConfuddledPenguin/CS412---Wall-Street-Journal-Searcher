   NEW YORK -- New York City officials are expected to
announce as early as today that five large Wall Street
investment banking firms have been picked to head its new
bond underwriting syndicate.
   A spokesman for city Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman
wouldn't confirm the names, but other officials said the
city's senior underwriting managers are CS First Boston
Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit; Goldman, Sachs & Co.; the
Bear Stearns Cos. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. unit; American Express
Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.

   Last year New York issued about $35 billion of general
obligation bonds and paid more than $30 million in fees to
its lead and other underwriters. The city's senior
underwriting managers were Goldman and Merrill Lynch, but the
city dropped Merrill when the firm moved some jobs to New
Jersey.
   The new list doesn't include any firms headed by
minorities or women. Mayor David Dinkins, is believed to have
wanted to include at least one minority or woman-headed firm
as a senior manager, while Ms. Holtzman placed emphasis on
the size of the firms, analysts said. Dinkins administration
officials have stressed that the lineup can change at the
last minute, although an official familiar with the process
said a change seems unlikely.
