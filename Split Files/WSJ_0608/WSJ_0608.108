   Nevada Power Co., Las Vegas, Nev., said about 900 clerical
and plant workers went out on strike, affecting the company's
entire operation.
   The company said it believed it could provide service for
its 328,000 existing customers by using supervisory and
salaried personnel. But new construction for residential and
business connections will be delayed or suspended, the
company said.

   "That's where the crunch is going to come," said David
Barneby, vice president for power supply. "We're in the midst
of a huge building boom here."
   The union local's business manager, Jim Brimer, disagreed.
"There will be tremendous delays in restoring service if
there are any power outtages," he said. Las Vegas has
experienced 100-degree heat all week. On Wednesday, members
of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
overwhelmingly rejected a tentative four-year contract. The
company rejected a new union proposal yesterday, prompting
the walkout. The major issues are wages, medical benefits and
overtime.
