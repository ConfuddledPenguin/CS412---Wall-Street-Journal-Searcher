   WELLINGTON -- When New Zealand's economic fortunes are
waning, many move to neighboring Australia, where a bigger
market usually offers a better chance of prosperity.
   Lately, though, the many are moving back to New Zealand.

   "It's the big-city lights" that lure the restless across
the Tasman Sea to Australia, says David Caygill, New
Zealand's finance minister. "So there's a flow all the time
across, but now as many are returning as leaving, and that
certainly wasn't true a year ago."
   To what does he attribute the trend? "Our economy is
picking up and the Australian one is doing the opposite," Mr.
Caygill says.
   By several economic barometers, New Zealand's economy is
staging a recovery, albeit a fragile one. The latest figures
show that the economy is gradually expanding, inflation is
falling and unemployment is easing. Moreover, a wide-ranging
economic overhaul has made the country more competitive, with
productivity up and the stage set for export growth.
   Still, Mr. Caygill says: "The weird thing is the mood is
pessimistic."
   It is indeed. Businesses are balking at investing; they
say the government has backtracked on reshaping the economy.
Disillusioned voters are signaling that they have had enough
of the Labor Party rule that, they say, has turned the nation
of three million people on its ear since taking power in
mid-1984.
   From one of the world's most protected economies, New
Zealand has aspired to become a bastion of free-market,
supply-side economics. The six-year transformation has
saddled the country with relatively high real interest rates,
put a historically large number of people out of work, and
left shell-shocked New Zealanders worried that there will be
little gain for their pain.
   The government must hold an election by October, and
political commentators already are calling on the Labor Party
to put itself and the populace out of their misery by holding
the election sooner. Recent opinion polls predict a landslide
for the main opposition group, the conservative National
Party.
   "We seem to be down in the dumps," observes Lindsay Pyne,
who heads government-controlled Bank of New Zealand.
Downtrodden New Zealanders, he says, "need to believe in
themselves again" to propel the economy.
   Without that all-important confidence, the nascent
economic recovery may fizzle, economists, bankers and others
say. According to a May survey by National Bank of New
Zealand Ltd., business confidence was at its lowest level in
18 months. Farmers were generally the most pessimistic about
the country's economic prospects, followed by manufacturers
and retailers.
   Economic growth "has to be underpinned by business
investment," says Girol Karacaoglu, National Bank of New
Zealand's chief economist. The outlook, he and others say, is
for a sluggish economy. Many private economists expect the
economy to expand by a weak 1% to 2% in the next year or so.
   Based on the latest official figures, the economy grew
less than 1% in 1989, in contrast to a slight contraction in
1988. For the fiscal year ending June 30, the government is
estimating growth of about 1.5%. It hopes to attain a rate of
between 2.5% and 3% next year.
   "We should aim for 3% growth a year as a medium-term
objective, and I'd like to shoot for higher," says Finance
Minister Caygill. He says New Zealand needs to grow between
5% and 6% annually to boost its standard of living, which has
plunged well below that of many industrialized countries
after having been at the top of the list in the 1950s.
   Since coming to power, the Labor government has floated
the New Zealand dollar and deregulated various areas of the
economy, including the financial system, airlines and the oil
industry. It cut tariffs and all but abolished import quotas,
took away industry subsidies, lowered corporate and personal
tax rates and "corporatized" many government-owned companies
by making them operate more like private-sector businesses.
   It also sold hundreds of millions of dollars of government
assets, including the national flag carrier, Air New Zealand,
the country's steel company, its oil-exploration concern, the
state insurance company and nearly half the government's
stake in Bank of New Zealand. It has put the national
telephone company on the auction block and plans to sell
rights to cut timber in government-owned forests.
   Still to come is a further deregulation of the labor
market, a restructuring of the railways, an overhaul of
coastal shipping and the sale of the three international
airports.
   It's the stuff of a private businessman's dreams. Yet
business is uneasy. Executives say the government hasn't
reined in spending, particularly on social programs, and they
fear increased taxes to foot the bill. They argue that the
government has been slow to tackle areas, such as the labor
market, that are keeping costs high and discouraging exports.
Moreover, they say the economy still is riddled with
regulations and relatively high tariffs.
   "It's quite wrong to see New Zealand as some kind of Hong
Kong," says Roger Kerr, a spokesman for the New Zealand
Business Roundtable. The government's momentum slowed after
it was re-elected in 1987, thus delaying the benefits of the
economic shake-up. Now, he says, "we're paying the price of
that breather."
   While the cost of the restructuring so far has been high
unemployment, which is currently about 7% of the labor force
as measured by internationally comparable standards, Mr.
Caygill maintains that his party's policies have arrested the
decline of New Zealand's living standards and resulted in a
more diversified economy that is less dependent on foreign
borrowings.
   The government and private borrowers owe foreign creditors
a total of more than NZ$47 billion (US$27.09 billion),
equivalent to about 70% of the country's economic output.
Interest payments alone consume about 20% of the country's
export earnings, helping to constrain economic growth.
   In 1989, a surge in imports and a decline in exports,
partly due to a drought, ballooned New Zealand's
current-account deficit to NZ$3.47 billion, or 5% of economic
output, from NZ$939 million, or 1.5%, in 1988. Economists
expect the deficit to widen further for at least the next
several months, thereby boosting the country's foreign debt.
   The government's goal is to slash inflation to below 2% by
December 1992. For the past year, inflation has been hovering
at about 7%, but that includes a one-time boost from a 2.5%
increase in a tax on goods and services. Some economists say
that using high interest rates to drive down inflation
bolsters the value of the local currency and makes the
country's exports more expensive than they otherwise would
be. That is undermining the productivity gains industries
have made, they argue, and comes at a time when the world
economy and export demand are slowing.
