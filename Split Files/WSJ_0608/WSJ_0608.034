   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The South African government
lifted its four-year-old state of emergency in most of the
country, hoping that the international community will now
also begin to lift its web of economic sanctions.
   The announcement by President F.W. de Klerk -- the latest
in a series of moves to normalize the country's political
situation -- repeals an array of regulations that gave the
government and police extraordinary powers to curb political
dissent through bannings, detention without trial and press
censorship. However, Mr. de Klerk said the emergency will
remain in effect in Natal province, where violence between
opposing black groups is common. More than 3,000 blacks have
died in Natal's political violence over the past three years.

   Most opposition organizations welcomed the end of the
emergency while also pointing out that more remained to be
done to level the political playing field for opposition
groups and eliminate apartheid, or racial segregation. Still,
it does move the government a step closer to meeting the
preconditions of the African National Congress for joining
Pretoria in full-scale negotiations over a new constitution.
In addition to the lifting of the emergency, the ANC demands
the release of all political prisoners and the return of all
exiles to South Africa. After initial talks last month
between the ANC and the government, the two sides are close
to finalizing details for fulfilling these two demands.
   The government's decision to lift the emergency comes
shortly after Mr. de Klerk's return from Europe, where, he
says, he sensed a willingness by some governments to review
their sanctions once the emergency was ended. Many of the
measures restricting trade and commerce with South Africa
were imposed as a response to Pretoria's declaration of the
emergency in June 1986. That move also triggered a wave of
disinvestment by European and U.S. corporations.
   By lifting the emergency, Pretoria is also hoping to
undercut Nelson Mandela's current tour through Europe and
North America. The African National Congress leader, who
spent 27 years in prison before being released in February,
is campaigning for sanctions to be maintained until
negotiations between the government and the black majority
over a new constitution are well under way.
   In Paris, Mr. Mandela said the lifting of the emergency
was a "victory for the people of South Africa, both black and
white." But, he added, "it doesn't change my mind" about
sanctions.
   Mr. Mandela, who is scheduled to arrive in the U.S. June
20, argues that any lessening of the sanctions pressure now
will lead Pretoria to slow down its pace of reforms. The ANC
also believes that sanctions are necessary to prod the
government's thinking on a new constitution: While the ANC
demands a one-man, one-vote system, the government rejects
simple majority rule and insists on protections for minority
rights. The ANC says this is apartheid in another guise.
   By ending the emergency, Mr. de Klerk is turning up some
pressure of his own on the ANC, particularly to renounce its
armed struggle. After last month's initial talks aimed at
clearing away the stumbling blocks for constitutional
negotiations, the government pledged to review the emergency
and the ANC promised to reassess its guerrilla campaign. Mr.
de Klerk said the government has fulfilled its part of the
agreement, and he called on the ANC to do likewise.
   "We are on the threshold of the real negotiation process
and the time has come for other important role players to do
their bit," Mr. de Klerk said. "In particular, the ANC must
now stop vacillating."
   Mr. de Klerk challenged Mr. Mandela to stop advocating
guerrilla activity and criticized his statement earlier this
week that the ANC approves of organized violence against
chosen targets. The ANC argues that its armed struggle
continues to be necessary as long as apartheid is still in
place.
   The government, which has embarked on a series of reforms
since it unbanned the ANC in February, is dependent on the
ANC's cooperation to fend off the white right wing. As the
white electorate watches the government make one concession
after another to the black majority, the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party is steadily eroding the support of the
ruling National Party. In a parliamentary by-election
Wednesday, the Conservatives fell only 500 votes short of
capturing a traditionally safe National Party seat. Last
October, the National Party won the seat by 3,000 votes.
   The Conservatives will make further gains should unrest
flare up after the lifting of the emergency. Conservative
Party leader Andries Treurnicht called the government move,
"another concession to the ANC."
   Still, the government has plenty of power under other
security legislation to restrict political activity and
control unrest by using the law and the courts. Mr. de Klerk
also announced plans to beef up the police force.
   Under the emergency, the police were protected against
prosecution for many of their actions and government
ministers could act without consulting parliament. As a
result, more than 30,000 people were detained in the past
four years, some two dozen organizations were banned,
political rallies were outlawed at will and several
newspapers were shut down for various periods of time. The
country's legal system was rendered virtually powerless, as
judges' discretion was generally limited to ruling whether a
particular action was covered by the emergency decree.
