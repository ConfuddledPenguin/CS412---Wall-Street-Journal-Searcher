   NARCOTICS AND COLOMBIA

   Colombia must urgently increase its foreign trade to
create jobs for people now dependent on narcotics traffic for
their livelihood, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
said.
   The country has made great progress in diversifying its
exports following a sharp decline in the price of coffee in
recent years, said a GATT review of trade policies in South
America. But the Geneva-based body, which sets rules for most
world commerce, added, "Further trade expansion is crucial
for Colombia."
   Colombia has increased its sales of coal, petroleum,
bananas, cut flowers, clothing and leather goods, said the
GATT report. But it said Colombia faces difficulties in major
export markets. It cited as an example U.S. anti-dumping
duties that almost doubled tariffs on Colombian carnations
and chrysanthemums.
   An unrelated report by two Colombian research groups noted
that murders in Colombia increased to 23,312 in 1989 from
9,122 in 1980 and said that nearly half of last year's
killings were probably linked to drug trafficking.
                                                                                                       

   ALGERIAN GAS FOR EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   Algeria will become the European Community's main supplier
of natural gas once a planned pipeline is completed, the
senior vice president of West Germany's Ruhrgas AG, Gerhard
Enseling, was quoted as saying in a report by the OPEC News
Agency. Mr. Enseling reportedly told an energy seminar in
Morocco that the EC had a long-term requirement of up to 45
billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. The seminar was
told that Algeria ultimately planned to transport as much as
17 billion cubic meters of gas a year through the pipeline,
which would pass through Morocco across the strait of
Gibraltar to Portugal.
                                                                                                       

   KENYA MAY LIFT A HUNTING BAN
                                                                                                       

   Kenya is considering lifting its current ban on wildlife
shooting. But Richard Leakey, the country's leading
conservationist, stressed that no big game or endangered
species would come under fire. "Certainly no elephants, no
rhino, no endangered species," said Mr. Leakey, who is
director of Kenya's Wildlife Department; instead, any
shooting would be a controlled effort to kill some plains
species that have runaway populations.
                                                                                                       

   THE EC AND WASTE
                                                                                                       

   European Community environment ministers agreed to tighten
controls on the production, transport and disposal of waste.
The measure approved by the ministers calls for the EC to
dispose of waste within its own borders, which would end the
much-criticized practice of sending waste to countries in the
Third World or in Eastern Europe. The ministers also said
member states should aim for "self-sufficiency" in waste
disposal to reduce the transport of waste around Europe.
                                                                                                       

   VISAS FOR ISRAEL
                                                                                                       

   More than a million Soviet Jews have received Israeli
immigration visas, according to the semi-official agency in
Israel that tracks such data. The agency said 1,163,350 Jews
held entry visas but were awaiting Soviet permission to
leave. Arabs opposing the immigration say they fear Israel
will settle the arrivals in the occupied territories, home to
1.75 million Palestinians, which Israel captured from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. A spokeswoman said
Israel was processing 1,500 entrance visas daily.
                                                                                                       

   `MAD COW' COMPROMISE
                                                                                                       

   European Community agriculture ministers agreed on tighter
measures to curb "mad cow" disease, and France, West Germany
and Italy agreed to lift bans on British beef imports.
   After an all-night emergency meeting, British Agriculture
Minister John Gummer said the bans would be lifted by
midnight last night. The bans were imposed because of concern
that the cattle brain disease, which has afflicted British
herds, affects human health.
   The basis of the agreement is that beef from herds where
the disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy -- was
confirmed could not be exported. Live cattle can be exported
only if they are younger than six months and are certified
not to be the offspring of a cow suspected of having the
virus.
   Britain has 150,000 herds of cattle and the disease has
been identified in 7,500 of them, British officials say.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .

   France should legalize brothels, former Health Minister
Michele Barzach said. Since brothels were banned in 1946,
prostitutes haven't been subjected to obligatory medical
tests, and Ms. Barzach said that it was thus impossible to
keep tabs on the spread of AIDS within France's prostitute
community. . . . A butterless diet including a lot of
spaghetti and very little meat is the recipe for World Cup
soccer success, according to Italian team doctor Antonio
Vecchiet. For those on the team who are too nervous to sleep
he prescribes extra camomile tea.
