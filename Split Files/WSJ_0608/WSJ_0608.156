   International Business Machines Corp. said it plans to set
up computer centers in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, in
conjunction with academic institutions, to advance technology
and initiate research projects.
   IBM Europe will provide the centers with advanced
hardware, a library of systems and application software, and
training and education for the staffs. It plans to lend the
computer equipment to the countries, including an IBM
3090-model mainframe priced at about $1 million, a spokesman
for the Armonk, N.Y.-based company said.

   This represents the first part of a broader initiative IBM
plans in Central and Eastern Europe to foster
information-technology advances and give scientists and
others access to tools to communicate in their fields or
participate in international projects. The centers will be
linked by a Vienna computer gateway to Western academic
networks.
   Setting up the centers is subject to export licenses being
granted by the U.S. and the Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls. IBM said the Hungarian and
Czechoslovak partners will sign a document that states the
end use of the computers will be for peaceful purposes.
   Once established, the IBM centers will be staffed and
operated by the local IBM partners, for access by academics,
students and people in industry. IBM's partner in Hungary
will be the University of Economics in Budapest; in
Czechoslovakia, Charles University and the Czech Technical
University.
