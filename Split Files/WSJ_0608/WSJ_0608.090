   Recycling White Paper
   Into Money in the Bank

   WHEN Matthew Costello looks at Boston's skyline, he sees
mountains of paper that could be recycled.
   Mr. Costello is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs
whose niche is helping companies set up in-house recycling
programs. His firm, Corporate Conservation, Cambridge, Mass.,
specializes in scrap white paper. Despite some recent
softening of the market for white paper, demand remains
strong, unlike the market for newspaper.
   Mr. Costello says setup costs for a program to recycle
white paper, which fetches $60 to $100 a ton, can be repaid
in a few months by sales. That's not to mention reduced
waste-disposal costs, he adds.
   For a fee, he arranges to install recycling bins, dickers
with paper buyers, educates employees on what to recycle and
checks their trash to make sure it has the right stuff. "We
didn't have the kind of knowledge and resources" to do all
that, says a spokeswoman for Beacon Cos., a commercial real
estate developer that's one of Mr. Costello's Boston
customers.
   Corporate recycling of newspapers, glass, plastic and
other things isn't necessarily profitable. But many companies
are setting up broad recycling programs regardless of profits
because of environmental concerns and new laws encouraging
trash reduction, says Steve Faust, a Montpelier, Vt.,
recycling consultant.
   Furthermore, says Jacqueline Neurauter, co-founder of
Ecologize for Profit, a recycling consultant in Arlington
Heights, Ill., "a lot of businesses are getting pressure from
their own employees" to recycle. And many programs are
started by "people who handle trash at companies and are
appalled" by what's thrown away, says Jeffrey Coyne of
Earthworm Inc., a nonprofit recycling consultant and paper
hauler in Boston.
                                                                                                       

   Beach Sweep Turns Up
   Everything, Even Sinks
                                                                                                       

   ITEMS COLLECTED in a national beach cleanup included a
wedding contract, Easter eggs, 605 hard hats and 1,895,502
plastic pieces.
   In various one-day cleanups held last fall, more than
65,000 volunteers in 25 states and territories collected 860
tons of debris, says the Center for Marine Conservation in
Washington, D.C., sponsor of the affair. Volunteers recorded
what they found, providing a unique audit of Americans' dirty
work down by the sea.
   Plastic accounted for 63% of the litter, with
Stryrofoam-style plastic foam winning the distinction as the
most abundant form. The conservation group singled out
cigarette filters, classified as plastic, as the most
frustrating item. Volunteers stooped to scoop up 164,141
butts.
   Beaches in Oregon and other states requiring bottle
deposits generally had fewer bottles than those in other
states. Syringes were most prevalent in Texas, but Delaware
and New York weren't far behind. New Jersey and Massachusetts
had the most sewage-associated trash, largely tampon
applicators, a sign of overflowing sewer systems. Louisiana
had the most garbage from ships' galleys, which included
plastic milk and water jugs and a carton of intact eggs
encrusted with barnacles.
   Dozens of trash-trapped animals were found, ranging from
mice caught in bottles to herons tangled in fishing lines.
Volunteers found 18,251 balloons, which turtles and other
animals are known to eat with fatal results.
   Besides finding a few sinks, volunteers also found nine
messages in bottles. One read, "Help me, I'm lost at sea. If
you find me, I will grant you a wish."
                                                                                                       

   Toxic-Waste Collector,
   At Residents' Disposal
                                                                                                       

   SEATTLE is making it easier for residents to get rid of
hazardous substances with a traveling "Wastemobile."
   Household hazardous wastes account for only about 1% of
U.S. trash by weight. But concerns are mounting about those
wastes -- such as paint, pesticides, used motor oil and
batteries -- because older landfills weren't built with
liners to keep liquid toxins out of ground water. Many
households dump the stuff down the drain, fouling water
treatment plants and poisoning waterways, or throw it in the
garbage, exposing trash handlers and landfill personnel to
toxins.
   Many towns hold annual collection days for the wastes. But
a study of collection drives in two cities showed that they
actually increase the amount of hazardous waste tossed in the
trash, says William Rathje, a University of Arizona garbage
researcher. "The publicity for the collection days makes
people realize" that they possess hazardous materials, he
explains. "They don't want it around the house, so they throw
it out," instead of bothering to tote it to a collection
point on the designated day.
   Seattle's Wastemobile is a truck and trailer that stops
for two weeks at a time in various places throughout King
County. Its movements are planned to bring it within 15
minutes of every home every six months, says Henry Draper,
program director. During its first six months of operation,
the Wastemobile collected 60% more hazardous material than
expected. But it isn't cheap. The program will cost King
County $1.5 million for the first 27 months.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   BIOLOGISTS with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Fort
Collins, Colo., have started a newsletter, titled Ribbet, on
the mysterious recent declines in populations of frogs and
other amphibians. . . . To fight smog and traffic, Champlain
College of Burlington, Vt., says it's offering free bus
passes, discount bicycles and even free gasoline to employees
and students who park off campus and ride the bus.
