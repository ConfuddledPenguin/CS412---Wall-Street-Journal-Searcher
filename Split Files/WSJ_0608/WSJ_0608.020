   In "The 1990 Civil Rights Bill Is Wrong" (editorial page,
May 4) Abigail Thernstrom misrepresents the intent and the
effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1990. This bill corrects a
series of Supreme Court decisions made in June 1989 that
narrowly interpret equal-employment opportunity and
civil-rights laws. It does not mandate or "invite" quotas, as
Ms. Thernstrom asserts.
   For 18 years, employers had the burden of showing that
employment practices with a "disparate impact" (that operated
to exclude minorities and women disproportionately) are
required by business necessity. The Supreme Court's June 1989
decision in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio razed this
settled law and placed an extreme and unprecedented burden on
discrimination victims by making them prove specifically the
practice that ultimately led to discrimination. The Civil
Rights Act of 1990 sends the message that employment
discrimination is never acceptable and returns the burden of
justifying any business practice that results in disparate
impact to the employer.

   Furthermore, on May 2 the bill was amended so that
employers can prove business necessity by showing that a
challenged practice "bears a substantial and demonstrable
relationship to effective job performance." In other words,
employment decisions made to create an effective work force
are justifiable under the Civil Rights Act of 1990. Thus, the
law allows employers to hire the best-qualified people and
does not place us on the crest of the slippery slope of
hiring and promotion quotas as envisioned by Ms. Thernstrom.
   Ms. Thernstrom says the Civil Rights Act of 1990 may
"deliver a message that minority groups amount to separate
nations and separate nations require distinct treatment." To
the contrary, the act seeks to prevent dangerous separate
treatment, which is in part what triggered Wards Cove. In
this case, Frank Atonio and other salmon-cannery workers,
mostly Filipinos and Alaska Natives, sued their employer for
hiring practices that excluded them from the better-paying
jobs and favored whites. For instance, the Wards Cove Packing
Co. maintained racially separate hiring pools and job
categories. The company's dormitories and cafeterias
generally separated white employees from nonwhite employees.
"Separate" and "distinct" treatment is precisely what the act
seeks to eliminate by providing discrimination victims a
reasonable chance of proving discrimination.
   The Civil Rights Act of 1990 also addresses other
intolerable inconsistencies created by the Supreme Court's
June 1989 decisions. The law ensures that job bias based on
gender and race is always illegal, that statutes of
limitation are applied fairly and consistently, and that
victims of intentional discrimination can recover damages.
   If passed, the Civil Rights Act of 1990 will enable this
country to continue to eradicate workplace discrimination by
restoring the well-tested legal standards used to prove
employment discrimination for the past 25 years.
