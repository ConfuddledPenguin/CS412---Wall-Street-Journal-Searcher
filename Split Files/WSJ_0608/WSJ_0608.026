   PARIS -- At first glance, the small square in Paris's 20th
Arrondissement is an exotic relief from a gray urban
backdrop.
   Women glide about in bright batik robes and headwraps of
Mali and Senegal, preparing the evening meal. As more women
emerge from the relative cool of their tents to join in the
work, their talk grows louder until it wakes sleeping babies
strapped to their backs.

   The men sit in a circle in the shade of a scrawny ash
tree, cracking nuts and talking quietly in dialects of their
native villages. The smell of peanut stew and rice hangs in
the air, drawing a stream of children from the tents.
   This odd village may seem pleasant enough to passersby.
But to the 48 families living here since May 2, when they
were evicted from two vacant apartment buildings nearby, it's
a caricature of home.
   The dozens of mattresses covering the ground inside the
tents are filthy after 28 days' double duty as floor and
bedding. Out of nearly 300 people camping in the square, 153
are children. The square has no toilet; a small fountain
provides the only water.
   Paris municipal authorities say these people don't have a
right to public housing because they illegally "squatted" in
vacant buildings. Granting their housing demands, Paris
Deputy Mayor Jean Tiberi has said, would create a dangerous
precedent, and would "penalize those who respect the law and
had patience to wait."
   Jean Blocquaux of France's Social Affairs Ministry rejects
this argument. The expelled squatters have done more than
their share of waiting; some have been on the city's
"priority" housing list for 13 years, he notes. For many,
their homes were destroyed by arson or were condemned, and
the city was legally obligated to rehouse them.
   "It didn't," says Mr. Blocquaux, "and so they found
themselves in the street."
   The Africans said they saw public housing buildings
standing vacant for months at a time. Finally, out of angry
desperation, they moved in.
   The irony -- at a time when race and immigration are
explosive issues in France -- is that as a group, these
squatters are successful examples of immigrant integration.
Most hold full-time jobs. All pay taxes and send their
children to French schools.
   Mamadou, 37 years old, who asked to be identified only by
his first name, emigrated from Mali to France 15 years ago.
He has been on the city's waiting list for rent-controlled
housing since 1980. He works full time, as a maintenance man
in a Paris fitness club. Out of his monthly paycheck of 5,600
francs (about $985), he returns almost 2,000 francs to the
state. More than 10% of his taxes are a fee for "housing
aid," which the government redistributes to low-income
families."It's a bad joke," Mamadou says.
   The joke gets worse: Some of the men in the encampment are
employed by the city as street sweepers. "I was hired to
clean the street -- not to live in it," a Senegalese man
says.
   Mr. Blocquaux and others in the Socialist-led government
say the city's allocation of public housing is unfair. They
say Paris possesses many vacant public-housing units, which
it holds for preferred clients. Mr. Blocquaux thinks the city
is discriminating on racial grounds, noting that of 3,000 new
public housing units provided in 1988, only 132 were given to
immigrant families. Yet there were 14,000 immigrant families
on the "priority" list.
   A recent government report shows that more than 60% of
units the city provided since 1988 were priced beyond the
means of people eligible for them. Only the richest of the
poor can afford "low-rent" housing.
   The government blames Gaullist Mayor Jacques Chirac for
what it believes to be a policy of gentrification; it says
Mr. Chirac fills public housing with allies who are not
underprivileged.
   At Place de la Reunion, neighbors have rallied with an
overwhelming show of solidarity for the immigrants.
Restaurants donated food and kitchen equipment; residents
opened their homes and pocketbooks, and children from a
nearby school wrote a letter to City Hall. A local support
committee provides day care for the children and drives them
to school.
   But this informal group is made up of volunteers who have
jobs. Some days the van doesn't come, so the kids miss
school, a few miles away. Last week, when no van came,
Mamadou's nine-year-old son took a subway trip with his
three-year-old sister to find school on their own. Mamadou
and his wife, Hawa, were frantic. "We were very lucky they
came back safe," she says.
   Sooner or later, that family will have a home. The city
has backed down from its initial refusal, and has now
proposed apartments -- to 12 families -- in the northern
suburb of Saint-Denis.
   Most of the apartments are in a building that was
condemned several years ago. Paris, which owns it, has now
"un-condemned" it, although some apartments -- which lack
bathrooms, heat and hot water -- are not yet habitable.
   Paris has lost 10% of its population since 1982, as
skyrocketing real-estate prices drive people farther away.
There are dwindling pockets of the mix of races and classes,
businesses and residences that historically characterized the
city.
   Looking around the squatters' square on the Place de la
Reunion, Mamadou says, "Sometimes it does seem like a
village. But in a village, you can do as you like; here you
struggle to keep up morale."
