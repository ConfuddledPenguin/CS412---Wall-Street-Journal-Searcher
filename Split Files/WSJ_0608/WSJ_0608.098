   WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said it canceled TRW Inc.'s $736 million
project to build a "space tug" that could boost satellites
into higher orbits.
   The cancellation reflects the severe budget pressures
facing NASA, which recently scaled back the project in hopes
of saving it. The Bush administration has asked Congress to
approve a 24% increase in the NASA budget, to $15.13 billion,
in the coming fiscal year, but lawmakers are expected to vote
a substantially smaller increase. A NASA spokesman said the
agency wanted to preserve funds to renovate the space shuttle
and its main engines.

   The space tug -- officially known as the Orbital
Maneuvering Vehicle -- looked more like a flying saucer than
a tugboat. It was an unmanned craft 15 feet in diameter that
would have been carried into orbit on the space shuttle for
the first time in January 1995. The tug's main purpose was to
boost the Hubble Space Telescope and a proposed X-ray
telescope into higher orbits to increase their orbital life.
The space shuttle also can boost the telescopes, but not as
high as the tug could have.
   NASA had grander designs for the space tug when it started
work on the project in 1986. The craft was supposed to help
build NASA's proposed space station, pull useless satellites
out of orbit and go into orbit around the Earth itself to
await new orders. But the project quickly ran into trouble.
   Harold Coldwater, a space-tug manager at NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the project had
a cost overrun of about $110 million. The project fell 18
months behind schedule and, overall, was running at about
twice its original cost estimate, NASA said.
   Last fall, the space agency tried to save the project by
cutting back the tug's capabilities. By choosing cheaper
rockets and less sophisticated navigation, the agency reduced
the tug's ability to maneuver in space and to boost
satellites. It also gave up the ability to base the tug at
the space station -- which had fallen well behind schedule
too -- or have it orbit independently.
   But the reprogramming left the tug with too little to do,
and NASA decided it was better off spending its money
elsewhere. William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for
space flight, said he figures the space agency will
eventually need a tug-like capability but that NASA has at
least two or three years to decide exactly what kind of craft
will be necessary.
   NASA estimated it has spent $200 million so far on the
tug, which was still in the design stage. However, canceling
the project won't help NASA immediately with its budget
problems. The space agency had asked Congress for $85 million
for the program in the coming fiscal year -- just about the
amount it said it needs to close down the project.
