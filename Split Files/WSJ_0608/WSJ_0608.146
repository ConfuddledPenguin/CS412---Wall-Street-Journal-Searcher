   MILAN, Italy -- The Italian subsidiary of U.S. food
company Kraft General Foods Inc. is to take a majority stake
in a new holding company being set up to control the Pietro
Negroni S.p.A. salami and cold meats group.
   Kraft General Foods is a unit of Philip Morris Cos.

   The accord with Negroni strengthens Kraft's position in
the Italian market while giving the privately owned Negroni
group access to Kraft's financial and technological
resources, top executives of both companies said.
   Under the agreement, Kraft General Foods Italia S.p.A.
will take an approximately two-thirds stake in the new
holding company. (Kraft already has a 25% stake in Negroni.)
The Negroni family, which has been in the prepared-meats
business since 1907, will have a one-third stake in the new
company.
   "The aim is to create an Italian meat concern to compete
better internationally. . . . It is useful to combine forces
to develop the company," said Negroni Chairman Pietro
Negroni, noting that exports would be targeted particularly
at the European and North American markets. The new holding
company is likely to be called Negroni Holding '93.
   Kraft General Foods Italia Chairman Ernesto Fugazzola
would give no details of the cost to Kraft of the
transaction, but said that it had been calculated on the same
basis as other recent transactions in the sector. Despite its
minority stake, the Negroni family will have considerable
influence on the board of the new holding company, especially
concerning strategic investments.
   Mr. Fugazzola said the holding company could eventually be
listed on the Milan stock exchange, although there were no
plans at present for such a step.
   Kraft has been active in Italy for more than 25 years.
Last year, Kraft's Italian unit reported after-tax operating
profit of 77 billion lire ($62.2 million) on sales of 1.22
trillion lire. Employing close to 4,000 people, its main
products include mayonnaise, cheeses, prepared plates, tuna
and pasta.
   Negroni is considerably smaller, with after-tax operating
profit of 1.5 billion lire last year on sales of 140.6
billion lire, and around 800 employees. Its production,
concentrated in four sites around Parma and Cremona in
northern Italy, consists primarily of salami, ham, cold meats
and stuffed pasta.
