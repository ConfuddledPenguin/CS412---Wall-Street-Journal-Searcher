   BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina made a $40 million interest
payment to foreign creditors, the first since foreign debt
payments were suspended more than two years ago, economy
ministry officials said.
   Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, confirmed that
payments were renewed following "arduous" discussions in New
York between Central Bank Vice President Javier Gonzalez
Fraga and individual creditor banks.

   The interest payment, ministry individuals said, is
considered "a gesture of good will" aimed at aiding Mr.
Gonzalez Fraga in talks that began this week with the
steering committee of a consortium of private creditors.
   Argentina, the developing world's third-largest debtor,
owes a total of $60 billion plus interest arrearages that
could reach $8.5 billion by year end.
   The government, ministry individuals said, hopes to
negotiate an agreement to pay $300 million in overdue
interest by year end. Creditors reportedly have sought
payment of $500 million. If negotiators reach an agreement,
Argentina would make another interest payment of between $70
million and $80 million.
