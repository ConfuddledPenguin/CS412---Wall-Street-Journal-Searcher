   FORT WORTH, Texas -- It's getting to be an old joke, but
the head of American Airlines' international services, Hans
Mirka, doesn't so much as chuckle. When his managers
introduce themselves to travel officials in Europe, he says,
the response often is, "Which American airline? You mean Pan
Am?"
   Pan Am and other global carriers may take some solace in
this confusion over a generic-sounding name, but not much.
That's because they know what the travel agents don't yet.
American, the undisputed king of deregulated U.S. skies, is
going global. And that is no laughing matter for the
competition.

   "They're an aggressive and expansionist airline," says
British Airways spokesman David Burnside. "We admire them."
   With domestic growth slowing, American is under pressure
to broaden its international business to maintain its recent
double-digit gains in passengers and revenue. Other former
stay-at-home U.S. carriers -- Delta, America West and USAir,
among them -- are seeking a stronger presence abroad for the
same reason. But only American has its sights set on three
continents at once.
   The deep-pocketed carrier picked up Eastern Airlines'
routes to South America for $310 million earlier this year.
It has moved most aggressively into Europe, anticipating a
surge in traffic when trade barriers come down in 1992.
Several months ago, American agreed to buy Trans World
Airlines' Chicago-London business for $195 million; American
hopes to secure federal approval to fly the route sometime
this summer. American is also seeking other European routes.
   To supplement its single flight to Tokyo, American is
competing against nine other U.S. carriers for six important
new passenger routes to Japan, a market expanding five times
as fast as the domestic one. The public counsel for the U.S.
Department of Transportation is expected to issue a
preliminary recommendation on the matter today.
   American is in a strong position to maintain an
international network. With 200,000 passengers a day, it has
"the biggest, most mature domestic market in the world," Mr.
Burnside of British Airways notes. That gives American
considerable "feeder traffic" to funnel onto overseas
flights.
   American's drive to become an international powerhouse
traces back to 1982, but the pace is accelerating. The
airline is adding so many destinations so fast that some
believe it could overtake the likes of Pan Am and TWA,
international carriers for half a century, within several
years. In Europe, however, Pan Am now serves 41 European
cities, TWA 24 and American 11.
   Why not simply buy Pan Am or TWA? "We've always said we
don't want to buy another airline," says Robert L. Crandall,
chairman of American and its parent, AMR Corp. "We don't want
to acquire another airline's airplanes. We don't want another
airline's people. We are only buying the right to fly."
American wants to avoid the labor hassles of integrating
union workers. And it disdains buying used planes, preferring
to maintain a uniform fleet of airliners built to its
specifications to keep down training and maintenance costs.
   But American admits that its foreign offensive has been
bumpy and fraught with missteps. Take its headlong rush last
year into Stuttgart, Hamburg and Geneva, with flights from
the U.S. that passed through Brussels. Expensive landing fees
and thin traffic on the last leg made the one-stop routes too
costly and they had to be abandoned. American's route
planners adopted a new rule as a result: nonstops or nothing.
   Meanwhile, some of its hard-won international routes are
being flown infrequently or not at all because American
doesn't own enough long-haul aircraft. It has only two Boeing
747s, for instance. Even $20 billion in planes ordered in the
past five years will provide limited relief when they roll
in, because the order doesn't include enough widebodies. "To
put the plainest face on it," says Mr. Crandall, "we guessed
wrong."
   This hasn't stopped American from aggressively seeking
international passengers. Its newspaper and magazine ads seem
ubiquitous on both sides of the Atlantic. In European ads,
they always picture an American Airlines jet so readers know
the ad refers to a specific airline.
   American's high profile seems to rile Delta. Although
Delta declined to comment for this article, it took a potshot
in a recent employee publication. "While Delta has moved with
less publicity," the statement read in part, "we believe our
expansion has been more orderly and sure-footed." Delta has
fewer routes to Europe, but more to Asia.
   American has pulled out all the stops in its efforts to
woo European travel agents and corporate travel managers, who
hold greater sway over customers' travel decisions than their
U.S. counterparts. American has been offering the agents free
first-class trips, hoping its luxurious service will win them
over "company by company, individual by individual," says
Michael Gunn, American's head of marketing.
   The carrier spares no expense on its first-class service.
Passengers nestle into supple, sheepskin and leather seats
that cost $24,000 a pair. The smell of bread and
chocolate-chip cookies being baked inflight wafts through the
cabin. Lobster fajitas are served on china with a vase of
fresh flowers alongside. And should a traveler tire of the
movie he has slipped into his personal video cassette player,
he can recline his seat nearly horizontal to doze under
oversized blankets.
   American intends its service to rival that of heavyweights
such as Swissair, Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific. "We don't
want to hear that Swissair does better than we do," declares
Donald Carty, American's executive vice president of
planning. "And we certainly don't want to hear that British
Airways does better than we do."
   But the carrier's marketing efforts will be wasted if it
doesn't rectify its seat shortage, and soon. Acquisitions of
foreign routes have outstripped aircraft deliveries, forcing
American to accelerate its "musical planes" game. It bailed
out of service to Lyon and Frankfurt this spring and
postponed flights to Helsinki, Warsaw and Barcelona -- set to
start this month -- to free up enough jets to fly
Chicago-London twice a day and the longest South American
routes.
   Such maneuvers may not bode well for the carrier's hopes
for added route awards from the Transportation Department.
The agency prefers to award routes to carriers that promise
to make the most seats available, and it has appeared partial
to fleets with lots of 747s. American doesn't much like 747s,
preferring the more cost-efficient 200-seat Boeing 767. In
any case, it would have to wait at least three years for new
747s because of Boeing's large backlog.
   Big planes are especially important if American is to
increase service to Japan and hopes to snare one of the new
Soviet routes recently authorized. So, admittedly
halfheartedly, "we're out rustling around looking for 747s,"
says American's operations chief, Robert Baker.
   The plane American plans to use most in its international
expansion, along with the 767, is the MD-11, a new, extremely
economical plane from McDonnell Douglas. American has ordered
15 of the jets, whose flying range matches that of the 747,
but which seat only about 250. The first MD-11s, originally
due at American in the fall of 1990, are now expected in
early 1991, but American executives fear the manufacturer
could fall further behind.
   American's jet shortfall could worsen considerably over
the next couple of years if other carriers put desirable
routes on the block that it feels compelled to snap up.
Continuing financial difficulties at Pan Am and TWA make that
a strong possibility.
   Critics charge that American uses the excuse of too few
planes to extricate itself from embarrassing, money-losing
routes. In fact, American is open about its practice of
abandoning a route that isn't profitable reasonably soon. "We
either succeed, and succeed fairly fast," says Wesley
Kaldahl, an American consultant who once ran the
international operations, "or we say the hell with it. There
are better things to do with our airplanes."
   In 1983, American pulled out of Rio de Janeiro after nine
months of losses. It ended its New York-Lyon run last week
after the route failed to turn a profit.
   Experimental routes such as Rio or Lyon do pay off in
other ways, though. By flying untried routes, American has
gained valuable international operating experience and
bolstered its image as an international carrier in the minds
of passengers, travel agents and government officials. "They
positioned themselves to take advantage of route
opportunities that came up later," says William H. Pacelli, a
manager at Avmark Inc., a consulting firm.
   In going global, American has been barred from using some
of its most successful domestic sales tools. Because of tight
regulations in some European countries, it has had to forgo
using its AAdvantage frequent-flier program. Nor can American
engage in the kind of quick fare changes abroad that are
common at home; fare changes overseas are subject to
government reviews that can take weeks.
   And, even though American is spending big money to bolster
its international staff and improve ground service in the
U.S., it can't affect ground service much in certain European
countries that rotate airport workers among carriers.
   American has seized on some new sales tactics, however. It
recently allied itself with the French rail service after
discovering that passengers to Paris often took trains to
their next destination. Combined ticketing for plane and
train will be a boon for American when it takes affect later
this year.
   While waiting to be discovered by Europeans -- and by
Americans bound for Europe -- American certainly isn't about
to fly at less than capacity. If it isn't packing in the
passengers, it'll pack in the cargo. "If you put 3,000 pounds
of cargo on a passenger flight, that's like having 92 more
passengers," said William Boesch, who heads American's cargo
division. Last year, American's European passenger "load
factor" hovered at a respectable 65.5%, while its cargo load
factor regularly broke an enviable 80%.
   Cargo doesn't have the cachet that passenger service does.
But American seems to accept that becoming an international
powerhouse may take time. "We haven't been, and are not going
to be, an overnight sensation," sighs Mr. Mirka.
