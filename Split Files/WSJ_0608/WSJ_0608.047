   MINNEAPOLIS -- Norstan Inc., whose stock was halted in
yesterday's national over-the-counter trading, said it's
reviewing the value of its $5.65 million stake in closely
held New Summit Inc.
   Norstan makes office-automation products. New Summit,
Plymouth, Minn., is a maker of gears for boats and planes.

   Norstan said New Summit is in default on certain of its
loan covenants with a lender. Norstan said that "any
potential reduction" in the value of its investment in New
Summit will be recorded as a loss in the Norstan's fourth
quarter ended April 30.
   Norstan also said it may delay its planned earnings
announcement for its fourth quarter. In the year-earlier
quarter, Norstan had net income of $1.3 million, or 43 cents
a share. Sales were $30.1 million.
