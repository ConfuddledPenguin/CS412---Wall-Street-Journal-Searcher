   OTTAWA -- Negotiations to resolve Canada's constitutional
impasse stalled last night after five days of talks, and
several provincial premiers warned that the situation is
critical.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the nation's 10
provincial premiers have been meeting here since Sunday night
to try to resolve the constitutional dispute. They will meet
again this morning. The premiers are stalemated over
recognition of French-speaking Quebec as a "distinct society"
within Canada.

   "We say enough is enough," said Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa. Quebec "can't and won't accept amendments" to the
Meech Lake accord, a package of proposed constitutional
amendments. One Meech Lake clause recognizes Quebec as a
"distinct society."
   The provision is highly prized by Quebec as recognition of
its cultural uniqueness even though constitutional lawyers
say it won't add to the province's powers. The distinct
society clause "simply confirms the obvious," said Mr.
Mulroney. Quebec, he said, is different, and "that difference
is very much worth conserving in the interest of Quebeckers
and of all Canadians."
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said "it seems highly
unlikely" the premiers will be able to reach an agreement if
Quebec refuses to budge on the "distinct society" issue.
Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon said "we are in a very critical
situation."
   Several premiers were optimistic they would be able to
reach an agreement yesterday as they entered the government
conference here where they are meeting. Over the course of
the day provincial goverment officials said the premiers were
making progress. By late afternoon the officials were saying
the talks were at a decisive stage. They said all issues had
been discussed, proposed solutions were on the table and it
was now up to the premiers to accept or reject the proposals.
   Talks also involve reform of the federal Senate. Ontario
and Quebec each has 24 seats in the 104-seat chamber. The
smaller provinces are demanding a more equitable distribution
of seats.
   The smaller provinces have also been urging that the
Canadian Senate become more like the U.S. Senate in order to
get more power over the federal government. The Canadian
Senate is supposed to be a forum for regional concerns, but
it currently has only limited authority because its members
are appointed instead of elected. The appointments are made
by the prime minister.
   Some Canadians have reservations about a more powerful
Senate. "An elected Senate will bring substantive change to
Canada's parliamentary system, weaken central government,
diminish the powers of the House of Commons and make the
political process more derivative of American practice and
less influenced by the British experiences," said Dalton
Camp, a former senior aide to Mr. Mulroney.
   Quebec has refused to participate in negotiations on
Senate reform or any other constitutional issue until its
demands on the accord are met. The Quebec government says the
Meech Lake Accord will satisfy its "minimum" demands.
   The other provinces agreed several years ago to give
priority to Quebec's concerns because major constitutional
changes were made in 1982 without the consent of the Quebec
government. Government leaders had also pledged to address
the province's constitutional demands after Quebeckers
rejected separation from Canada in a 1980 provincial
referendum.
   Several provincial leaders said they recognized that
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa had little room for maneuver
in the negotiations because he is faced with an opposition
party, the Parti Quebecois, which advocates Quebec
independence.
   Parti Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau attacked Mr.
Bourassa earlier this week for allegedly making concessions
to the other provinces, and he demanded that Mr. Bourassa
abandon the negotiations.
