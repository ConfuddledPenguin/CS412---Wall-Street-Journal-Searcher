   Getting a Handle
   On TV Remotes

   IN A COMPLEX world, a little simplicity goes a long way.
   Doug Patton and Rick Jung have applied that rule to remote
controls for televisions.
   TV controls have become complicated and hard to use. Some
try to fit 50 or more buttons onto a surface the size of a
brick. "Most remote controls are multi-key horrors," says
Peter Edward Lowe, a Menlo Park, Calif., designer.
   So, Mitsubishi Electronics America asked Messrs. Patton
and Jung, designers from Costa Mesa, Calif., to simplify.
They designed a pen-sized control with only three buttons:
power, channel and volume.
   Instead of written clues, they used visual and tactile
clues. The power button is blue to distinguish it from the
others, which are black. Each button is a different size.
Rocker buttons permit channels to be changed or volume raised
or lowered with a single control.
   Mitsubishi says the PRM-1 remote control has been so
successful as a separate accessory, it is now being sold as a
standard part of several of the company's big-screen TVs. The
PRM-1 won a gold award this year from the Industrial
Designers Society of America. Mr. Lowe, a juror, concedes
that the device "may be hard to find, and it might roll off
the table," but he adds: "It's so easy to use."
                                                                                                       

   Political Statements
   Take Graphic Form
                                                                                                       

   BILLBOARDS are becoming more controversial.
   In San Francisco, Soviet artists, on an exchange, last
spring painted a billboard with a skeleton on water skis to
illustrate pollution. In Massachusetts, billboards will soon
start promoting the use of condoms to prevent AIDS. In West
Hollywood, Calif., a caricature of Jesse Helms lies athwart
an artist's palette, thumb hole through his forehead. The
caption: "Artificial Artofficial."
   The most controversial billboard artist, or at least the
most prolific, is Mark Heckman of Grand Rapids, Mich. Mr.
Heckman recently put up a billboard next to Interstate 196 in
the city, advertising "the seafood tuna lovers are killing
for . . . Flipper Canned Dolphin." He says the sign is meant
to remind people that although H.J. Heinz has agreed to sell
only dolphin-safe tuna, other companies are still killing the
marine mammals.
   Private backers pay for the Heckman signs. A businessman
who underwrote the dolphin sign wants to remain anonymous,
Mr. Heckman says, because a friend owns a supermarket chain.
   But Alfred Swanson, a surgeon who specializes in joint
transplants, and Peter Wege, a descendant of the founder of
Steelcase Inc., have no qualms about being known as funders
of a billboard urging people to "visit Menthol Beach," a
stretch of sand littered with cigarette butts. After that
sign appeared on the highway between Grand Rapids and Grand
Haven, Mich., the mayor of Grand Haven organized a cleanup of
that city's beach.
   Some Heckman targets strike back. Local lumber-industry
people didn't like a billboard covered with tree stumps that
warned against a "chainsaw massacre." They persuaded Dr.
Swanson to persuade Mr. Heckman to add the words "Save our
Rain Forests," thereby deflecting the criticism toward
tropical climes.
   And Gannett Outdoor, the sign company, had to talk fast to
persuade a Grand Rapids real-estate man not to cancel his own
billboard, after Gannett put up one of Mr. Heckman's signs
urging people to fight AIDS by wearing condoms. Later, a
group from Kalamazoo leased Mr. Heckman's spot to tell
people: "Abstinence] It beats AIDS."
                                                                                                       

   Trying to Bring
   Rainbow to Design
                                                                                                       

   BLACKS AND OTHER minorities appear to be under represented
in the design professions. Noel Mayo is setting out to try to
correct that.
   Mr. Mayo, who teaches design at Ohio State University in
Columbus, is compiling a list of blacks, Hispanics, American
Indians, Asians and other minorities who work as designers or
architects. So far, he has turned up 260, less than 1% of the
U.S. total in those fields.
   Mr. Mayo, who is black, gives three reasons for the low
number. Many minority young people have never heard of the
design profession, he says. They have few role models. And
minorities remain subject to discrimination, he says, though
he adds, "I don't know of any overt cases."
   Once his list is complete, Mr. Mayo, owner of a design
firm in Philadelphia, plans to send it to high schools and
colleges. He hopes they will use it to provide recruiters and
mentors for design students and fledgling design
professionals.
