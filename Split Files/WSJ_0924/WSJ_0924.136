   Although it didn't provide earnings figures for the first
half, Aeritalia said gross consolidated profit was above 35
billion lire, but down from 1989. The company blamed the
downturn in the defense industry and the dollar's drop over
the past year.
   Aeritalia said new orders totaled 860 billion lire as of
June 30, while total orders were valued at 5.5 trillion lire.
Investments stood at 98 billion lire, up from 77 billion lire
a year ago.
