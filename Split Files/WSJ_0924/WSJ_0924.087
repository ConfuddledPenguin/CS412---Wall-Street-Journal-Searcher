   BANGKOK, Thailand -- Five foreign banks learned a harsh
lesson in the frustrations of Thai politics this year.
   After months of negotiations, the Ministry of Finance
recommended in January that the five be granted licenses to
open branches, the first for foreigners since 1978.

   By February, that plan was on hold.
   Later, there were rumblings that the list could be
revived, and officials even hinted that it might suddenly
gain approval. Now the plan is absent from the political
agenda. The five banks, along with a dozen others, are back
to square one.
   "We're not making any assumptions about having a branch in
five years or 10 years," an executive from one of the banks
with a representative office says. But he adds, "We are
making money with what we've got."
   Across town, there isn't an empty seat or an idle employee
at Banque Indosuez. It's a scene repeated in every one of the
14 foreign banks with a branch license in Thailand. As
foreign investment in Thailand has soared and local companies
have looked overseas, foreign banks have reaped the rewards.
"We're doing extremely well," says one.
   Foreign bankers agree that there are tremendous
opportunities in Thailand, but there is a huge disparity
between the business that comes with a branch license and
that of representative offices, which number about 45. The
latter operate out of small facilities with only a few staff
members, and they are kept out of the very profitable
foreign-exchange business. The gap between the two kinds of
foreign operations isn't likely to change soon.
   The first bank in Thailand was a foreign bank, regional
giant Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., which opened a
branch in 1888. Foreign banks dominated the market until
World War II, when they were closed and a number of local
banks were established. Thai officials don't want foreigners
to gain prominence again.
   Now, the 14 foreign banks are up against 15 local banks
with more than 2,000 branches and 95% of the banking
industry's assets. Still, foreign bankers don't complain too
much. With loan growth of 33% in the first six months of this
year and the economy still vibrant, there are plenty of
opportunities.
   Most of the foreign banks with branch licenses concentrate
on trade finance, offering international services and
expertise that most of the local banks can't equal. Foreign
bankers also specialize in private banking, advisory and
stock-custodial services, and treasury and securities
operations.
   The government isn't entertaining applications from
licensed foreign banks for additional branches, effectively
keeping them out of consumer banking. Only Citicorp is really
interested in competing with the local banks in consumer
banking and is already a leader in home mortgages from its
lone branch. For most of the other banks, a second or third
branch might be nice, but it isn't vital.
   "Foreign banks are well-treated here. It's one of the
better environments in Asia to work in," says David L.
Hendrix, country corporate officer for Citibank in Thailand.
"The only area where we're not treated as a local bank is in
branching. For us, that's a severe limitation." It also slows
development of domestic banking, since foreign banks
typically bring innovations that force local banks to
modernize.
   Foreigners do bring in much-needed offshore financing.
Thailand's double-digit growth rate in the past two years
could not have been maintained without foreign money. Yet
foreign banks play a far less important role in Thailand than
in other Southeast Asian economies, such as Malaysia and
Singapore. The lucky 14 say they are little threat to the
local giants; they worry more about competition among foreign
banks for that 5% sliver of the market.
   Only two Japanese banks, Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Mitsui
Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., have branches in Thailand. Takehiko
Mori, chief representative in Bangkok for Industrial Bank of
Japan Ltd., says, "If we get a license here, our competition
will be the Bank of Tokyo and Mitsui Taiyo Kobe, not the Thai
banks."
   Industrial Bank has the biggest representative office in
the country and was one of the five banks on the short list
early this year. Foreign bankers say it could be three to
five years before the issue is revived, because the Thai
banks are a formidable political force.
   "The consensus is that {Thai} banks still need
protection," says George Morgan, analyst with Hoare Govett
Asia Ltd. in Bangkok.
   In the meantime, the representative offices are making
money. Some followed a few clients to Thailand and
concentrate on serving a growing overseas client base. Most
were able to streamline a process for quickly completing
transactions through their offices in Singapore or Hong Kong.
They say there is so much business that there is some for
every bank. Increasingly, Thai companies are losing their
aversion to foreign banks.
   A few representative offices, seeking a more active role,
also have taken a stake in local finance or securities
companies, for which they provide needed expertise and from
which they profited as the sector expanded.
