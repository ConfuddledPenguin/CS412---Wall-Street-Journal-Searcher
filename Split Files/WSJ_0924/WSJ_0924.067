   For a Much Smaller Increase in Rates

   Arizona Public Service Co. proposed a sweeping settlement
with the Arizona Corporation Commission that includes a
sharply reduced rate-increase request and a $250 million cap
on liability for costs related to a three-year-old nuclear
power plant.
   Arizona's largest electric utility conditionally offered
to freeze rates for three years after raising them 9.3% next
January. The utility's pending rate increase, filed earlier
this year, calls for a 6.8% increase in each of the next
three years, or slightly more than 21% compounded.

   "Quite frankly we recognized that customer bills after a
21% increase would have been too high," said Mark De Michele,
president and chief executive officer. The smaller rise would
cut the increased cost to customers by $600 million over four
years, he said.
   Arizona Public Service "is moving in the right direction
by lowering its rate request," said Gary Yaquinto, director
of the commission's utilities division. He indicated,
however, that "excess capacity, operating performance,
construction imprudence" and other issues could lead to staff
recommendations of "even further cuts."
   Arizona Public Service rates were harshly criticized by
PacifiCorp during its recent attempt to acquire the Arizona
utility or its parent, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. of
Phoenix, Ariz. PacifiCorp, based in Portland, Ore., had
promised to keep rate increases to 2% a year in each of the
next four years if its takeover bid succeeded. Last month,
PacifiCorp dropped its pursuit in exchange for seasonal power
swaps with Arizona Public Service.
   "If this would have been their first {request}, there
never would have been a bid by PacifiCorp," said Edward J.
Tirello, a utility analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. This proposal "is a quick and dirty way that cleans up"
all major disputes between the utility and state regulators.
"It makes a lot of sense."
   Mr. De Michele said the proposal wouldn't have been
possible without the PacifiCorp pact, potentially worth $260
million to Arizona Public Service. Among the proposal's
conditions are that the commission approve a $221 million
sale of the utility's 35-megawatt, coal-fired Cholla unit 4
plant. The initial PacifiCorp agreement specified that it
would buy partial interests in units 1 and 3.
   Mr. De Michele also said the lower rates were a reflection
of recently accelerated belt-tightening moves. Non-nuclear
jobs have been cut 30% to about 4,200 since 1988. About 2,840
workers are employed at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Station. Capital spending budgets have been pared by $770
million over five years. Last year, the utility spent about
$270 million on capital outlays.
   The proposed $250 million write-down is related to Palo
Verde unit 3, operated and 29.1%-owned by Arizona Public
Service. The utility has been seeking to recover $1.2 billion
in plant construction costs and deferred operating expenses.
The commission, which regulates utilities, has indicated it
probably will disallow a big chunk of those costs on various
grounds, including possibly that the reactor isn't needed and
never should have been built. It began commercial operations
in Jan. 1988.
   Arizona Public Service "doesn't acknowledge that any
portion of the plant is excess capacity or should not have
been built," Mr. De Michele said. "We are proposing that the
write-off resolve all issues of imprudent expenditures."
   The proposed 9.3% rate increase includes 3.4% for new
property taxes imposed by the state legislature earlier this
year. Arizona Public Service wants commission approval for a
"pass-through mechanism" that would let the utility collect
the taxes from customers in future years without making a
rate filing. The utility also said it plans to challenge the
new taxes in court.
   Mr. Yaquinto said the commission feels "a bit stampeded"
by the utility's demand for a response to its proposal by
Oct. 31. Mr. De Michele played down the deadline. "If we're
making progress in October then we'll pursue it." If not, the
utility would ask for interim rates to be put into effect and
would pursue its pending 21% rate filing, he said. The first
hearing on that case is set for Dec. 5.
