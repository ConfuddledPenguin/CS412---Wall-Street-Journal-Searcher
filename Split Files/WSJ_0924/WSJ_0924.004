   Not many tears have been shed over the firing last week of
Gen. Michael J. Dugan, U.S. Air Force chief of staff. Indeed,
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who wielded the ax, has
been praised widely in the press for reasserting the
principle that the U.S. military is under civilian control.
It had been a long time, 41 years, since a defense secretary
had publicly fired one of the Joint Chiefs. The prevailing
sentiment seems to be that maybe it should happen more often.
   There is much indeed to be said for high-level firings in
the face of crisis, although Winston Churchill at the outset
of World War II and Abraham Lincoln during the U.S. Civil War
sacked reluctant generals, not overeager ones. Gen. Dugan's
offense was excessive shooting off of the mouth. Whether that
is sufficient cause for firing in this age of garrulous
officialdom might be disputed. But a case can be made on the
basis of the sorts of things the general was saying to the
press. Not only might his bellicose rhetoric have spooked
some U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, but it raised questions
about whether the head of the U.S. Air Force really
understood the uses of the modern weapons the U.S. military
has at its command.

   The general offended his boss by telling reporters that
"downtown Baghdad" would be a prime Air Force target in case
of hostilities. Whatever the general was trying to say, his
remarks were interpreted to mean that the Air Force was
considering something equivalent to a World War II-style
assault on a population center. If that is what he meant, it
raises questions not only about his ability as a diplomat but
as a military strategist as well.
   Clearly, the first objective of any allied strike should
be to destroy, as quickly and thoroughly as possible, Iraq's
war-fighting capacity. Downtown Baghdad, unless Saddam
himself could be effectively targeted, is hardly the place
for that. The first objective would be Saddam's anti-aircraft
missiles and his combat aircraft. Control of the air, once
achieved, would be decisive to the final outcome, because
tanks and other ground forces then would become powerless to
defend themselves against air attack.
   The weapons deployed by the U.S. and its more-advanced
allies for this purpose are called "smart" weapons. Using
advanced electronic guidance, they can hit and blow up even
relatively small targets from many miles away. The cruise
missiles on the battleship Wisconsin, now deployed in the
Persian Gulf, are such weapons. So are HARM air-to-ground
missiles, used mainly to home in on air defense radars and
destroy them. F-117A stealth fighters, capable of evading
enemy radar for night attacks on major targets, have been
deployed in the region. Other attack planes are equipped for
night attacks with LANTIRN navigation and targeting pods.
   These and a wide array of other smart weapons are designed
to destroy very specific targets, such as radars, tanks and
other aircraft. Those targets can be pinpointed by U.S.
satellites. Because of their accuracy, the weapons minimize
civilian casualties. When the head of the Air Force talked of
massive bombing he may have been merely trying to frighten
Saddam. But given the kind of brute Saddam is, he probably
would far rather lose civilians than MiG-29s.
   A seeming fixation on old-fashioned methods was the source
of a major embarrassment during an Air Force sally against
Manuel Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces some months back.
Two F-117s, the most-advanced U.S. fighters, were assigned to
create diversionary explosions near a PDF barracks outside
Panama City. But instead of using the weapons they are
designed to employ, they simply dropped two World War II iron
bombs. One missed its target by 480 feet, a long distance
considering the accuracy these airplanes are meant to
achieve. Secretary Cheney, who had boasted of the plane's
accuracy, was furious when he learned of the miss.
   Results of NATO exercises indicate that U.S. jet pilots
are among the best in the world, but there is less certainty
about the quality of U.S. military planning. One source of
uncertainty is that old bugaboo, interservice rivalry and, in
some cases, intraservice rivalry. A lack of adequate
coordination among the services played a role in the failure
of the Desert One hostage rescue attempt during the Carter
administration. A series of fiascoes in Lebanon in 1983 was
blamed on an impossibly convoluted chain of command from
Washington to Beirut, not to mention some foolish demands
from the State Department that the U.S. forces not seem too
warlike, even though they were clearly in a war zone.
   One has reason to wonder how well coordinated the present
Persian Gulf operation is. If there aren't enough problems
getting the U.S. services to pull together, how about the
problems of coordinating the forces of 10 countries? Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces, seems to be
focusing mainly on getting enough tanks into the area, and
perhaps that is prudent. But if air superiority is achieved
quickly, will a tank war really be necessary? The army also
has tank killers, Apache helicopter gunships. One wonders
whether some of the strategy here is not strategy at all, but
an attempt to give every service unit a piece of the action.
It's a bit like running a war the way Congress runs the
Pentagon, making sure everyone gets his share.
   There also is the question of which department of the
administration is running this operation. The State
Department's performance in Lebanon in 1983 and the shocking
evidence that it might have caused Saddam to think he had a
green light cast doubt on its reliability in dealing with
hard cases. Was Gen. Dugan fired because he didn't know
enough about Navy missiles or because he offended State
Department types who still think that Saddam is susceptible
to adroit diplomacy? The fact that the general was chastised
for sounding too aggressive might suggest the latter.
   Finally, there is the question of why a member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff was so out of touch with policy. Had
the chiefs not had any discussions with Mr. Cheney and the
president about what form an attack on Saddam would take? If
the general was simply blowing diversionary smoke, presumably
he would not have been fired. But the suggestion is that he
didn't know he wasn't supposed to threaten a bombing of
downtown Baghdad, or, worse, didn't have a very clear idea of
exactly what the Air Force role in a possible attack would
be.
   That seems a bit too far-fetched to believe and yet the
fact remains that the general was fired for being out of step
with policy, whatever that policy might be. So a question
arises about whether that was the fault of the general, who
presumably had some abilities worthy of the top job in the
Air Force, or the fault of top policy makers? In a vast
enterprise such as the U.S. government, one can never be
sure.
