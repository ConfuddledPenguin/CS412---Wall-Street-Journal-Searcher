   Dentsu Inc., Japan's largest advertising concern, said it
will set up a branch office in Moscow.
   With the new office, which is scheduled to be established
next Monday, Dentsu will become the first Japanese
advertising company to create an office in the Soviet Union.

   Although the advertising market in the Soviet Union is
still in the developmental stage, Dentsu officials said, it
has potential to allow advertising businesses to grow as the
nation's economy shifts gears to a market base.
   The new office will map out and collect information in the
local advertising market and will provide Soviet enterprises
with advertising know-how. The new office will also assist
Japanese companies trying to penetrate the Soviet market.
