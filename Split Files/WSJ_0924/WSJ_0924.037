   FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it lowered its ratings on about $54 million of long-term
debt issued by Michigan National Corp.
   The rating concern downgraded the bank holding company's
subordinated debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2. Moody's also lowered
its ratings on the company's lead bank, Michigan National
Bank, for long-term and short term deposits, and long-term
and short-term issues backed by letters of credit.

   Moody's said the soft real estate market in the Midwest
has raised the risk of Michigan National's commercial real
estate assets. It also cited Michigan National's "mediocre"
core earnings. But Moody's said the holding company's
liquidity level appeared to be "prudent."
   The bank acknowledged the weakness in the real estate
market. But it said there is no "specific event" at Michigan
National to cause the downgrade. "The company continues to
focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet," a spokesman
said.
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Michigan
National shares closed at $24.50, down 25 cents.
