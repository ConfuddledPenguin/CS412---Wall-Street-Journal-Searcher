   STANFORD, Calif. -- An economist who recently incensed the
banking establishment when he called the federal
bank-insurance fund insolvent on national television has been
fired from his post as an unpaid research scholar at Stanford
University.
   R. Dan Brumbaugh, a thrift expert who was among the first
to predict that industry's collapse, said yesterday that
Stanford's director of the Center for Economic Policy
Research notified him that the university was canceling his
research project on banking in a letter dated Sept. 11.

   Mr. Brumbaugh said he believes that, while the center's
director has denied it, the termination is the result of his
feisty words on ABC News' "Nightline" on July 31. On that
news program, Mr. Brumbaugh said that six out of the 10
biggest banks were at or near insolvency, and the cost to
close them and hundreds of other failed thrifts was going to
outstrip the reserves of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which insures bank deposits up to $100,000.
   His remarks drew a firestorm of criticism and denials from
bankers and federal regulators. FDIC Chairman William
Seidman, who also appeared on the program, denounced the
economists' predictions as "irresponsible" and
"preposterous."
   The center's director, John Shoven, did not return calls
to his home yesterday, but he earlier denied in the press
that outside pressure played any role in the ousting of Mr.
Brumbaugh.
