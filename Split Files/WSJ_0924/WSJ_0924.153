   ATLANTA -- John Portman's debt woes may be starting to
hurt other people.
   The architect-developer, who has suspended payments on
millions of dollars of loans pending emergency talks with his
22 lenders, has been hit with at least 14 liens by
subcontractors who say they haven't been fully paid for their
work on Mr. Portman's new apparel mart in San Francisco. The
$90 million building, completed this summer, has been slow to
lease, in part because of a shakeout among clothing
retailers.

   "From what I understand, Portman has run out of money for
the job," said Clem Grant, president of Dual Lock Partition
Systems of Beaverton, Ore., a door maker that has filed a
lien for $87,000 of unpaid bills, due five months ago. "It
looks like we're at an impasse now, and there's nothing to do
but file a lawsuit."
   A spokesman for Mr. Portman denied that Portman Cos. has
run out of money to pay subcontractors. He said the 800,000
square-foot Fashion Center was built in just 17 months, a
speed that made a number of mid-course construction changes
necessary. Payment for those changes is now being negotiated,
he said. "It is absolutely not a question of either the
ability or the willingness to pay," insisted the Portman
spokesman.
   Separately, Chemical Bank filed a lawsuit against Mr.
Portman Friday to collect a $5 million line-of-credit loan
due Sept. 1. The New York bank, which filed the complaint in
state court here, is the second of Mr. Portman's unsecured
lenders to break ranks with a creditor committee that has
been working with Mr. Portman to come up with a collateral
pool to securitize his unsecured loans. Such dissension among
creditors on a committee isn't unusual, and some executives
close to Mr. Portman say more suits could follow.
   "We are not surprised or unduly concerned about the
lawsuit filed by Chemical Bank," Mr. Portman said in a
statement. The statement added that Portman Cos. expects the
collateral agreement to be completed shortly. Mr. Portman's
more than $2 billion of mortgage debt could be affected by
any agreement.
   It is not unusual for subcontractors on large construction
jobs to file liens for unpaid bills when a building is
finished. But several of the lienholders on Mr. Portman's San
Francisco property said they were shocked not to be paid
because the contractor who built the Fashion Center, Stolte
Inc. of Denver, had always paid promptly on past projects.
   "This is very unusual for Stolte," said Frank Greer,
president of American Masonry Inc., a Walnut Creek, Calif.,
masonry concern that has received only half of its $54,000
bill -- due Aug. 6 -- for Fashion Center work. "It shakes you
up. Twenty-seven thousand dollars may not mean much to them,
but it means a hell of a lot to me."
   Some of the claims are much bigger. Montgomery Elevator
Co. filed a lien on the Fashion Center for $656,000 of unpaid
work. Cramer Associates, an interior construction company,
filed one for $226,000. Kaiser Sand &amp; Gravel Co.'s lien is
for $131,000, and A. Ruiz Construction Co. &amp; Assocs. Inc. has
a lien on the Fashion Center for bills of $85,000, due three
months ago.
   "You're damn right it hurts," said Antonio Ruiz, president
of Ruiz Construction.
   Several lienholders also said one of the problems with the
project was an inordinate number of mid-stream change orders.
The changes, lienholders said, ran up costs and caused
confusion.
   That was also a big problem for Mr. Portman in the former
Portman Hotel in San Francisco, which he sold this year at a
large loss. That hotel ran more than $20 million over its
roughly $100 million construction budget, executives close to
Portman Cos. have said.
   Mr. Greer of American Masonry said about $6,000 of the
$27,000 he is still owed for Fashion Center work was from
change orders, many of which were caused by bad planning and
inconsistent specifications, he said. And Mr. Grant of Dual
Lock Partition said about $35,000 of the $87,000 his company
is still owed for the Fashion Center was from mid-course
additions and alterations.
   "There was one change order after the next," said Mr.
Grant. "It was a huge battle to get that building open. I
think Portman has paid just the bare minimum that they
contracted for in writing, but not all the additions and
changes they ordered verbally."
