   SALISBURY, Md. -- Second National Federal Savings Bank,
facing a deteriorating real-estate market, suspended its
dividend and increased its loan-loss reserves following an
investigation by federal regulators.
   Second National increased specific loan-loss reserves by
$7,880,000 and general loan reserves by $8,750,000. The
company said it plans to increase general loan reserves an
additional $8,750,000 over the next 18 months.

   The company, which has $1.8 billion in assets, said it
decided to suspend the dividend because it wouldn't be the
"most prudent expenditure of shareholder capital." The
company's quarterly payout had been nine cents a share, but
last month, Second National announced it intended to cut the
dividend 50%.
   Second National said real-estate developers aren't able to
"produce sufficient cash flow to support their borrowings"
and more stringent reserve requirements "have precluded
additional borrowing for interest carry."
   The company's nonperforming assets have risen to $62
million from $30 million in March.
