   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense consultant William Galvin was
sentenced to 32 months in prison after pleading guilty to
bribing two senior Pentagon officials to influence the
awarding of lucrative military contracts.
   Mr. Galvin, a major figure in the defense procurement
scandal, was also fined $10,000 by U.S. District Judge Claude
M. Hilton in Alexandra, Va., on his guilty plea to charges of
conspiracy, bribery and tax evasion.

   Along with another 32-month prison term given to a former
Unisys Corp. executive, Mr. Galvin's sentence was the longest
imposed in the long-running probe of Pentagon procurement
fraud.
   Mr. Galvin, 59 years old, faced a possible 40-year prison
sentence and fines of as much as $1 million. But prosecutors,
citing Mr. Galvin's "extraordinary cooperation" with the
investigation, asked Judge Hilton to impose a shorter prison
term. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica told Judge
Hilton that Mr. Galvin is expected to be "a critical witness
in future prosecutions."
   Mr. Galvin pleaded guilty in March to arranging payments
through a Swiss bank account to then-Assistant Navy Secretary
Melvyn R. Paisley for helping an Israeli company sell
pilotless intelligence airplanes to the Pentagon. Mr. Galvin
also said he paid $123,100 from 1983 to 1985 to a friend of
Victor D. Cohen, then a deputy assistant Air Force secretary,
knowing that some of the money would be given to Mr. Cohen to
influence the awarding of a contract on radar-warning
devices. Mr. Paisley and Mr. Cohen haven't been charged but
both are under investigation.
   Under his plea, Mr. Galvin agreed to pay the Internal
Revenue Service $648,548 in back taxes and interest.
