   TORONTO -- Striking workers at Ford Motor Co.'s Canadian
subsidiary yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
generous wage and benefit package that the Canadian unit of
cash-strapped Chrysler Corp. may find difficult to match.
   The agreement, reached after a marathon bargaining session
Friday, met the Canadian Auto Workers' major demands. The
12,800 Ford Motor Co. of Canada workers were expected to
return to work this morning, ending the week-long strike.

   The agreement includes percentage wage increases in each
year of the three-year contract, improved cost-of-living
protection, added time off and a broad income-security
program.
   Wages will increase by 7.5% in the first year, 6.7% in the
second year and 4.8% in the third. The increases include
estimated cost-of-living allowances of 4.5%, 4.7% and 2.8%,
respectively, designed to provide 90% protection against
inflation.
   Ford Canada also has established a 100 million Canadian
dollar (US$86.6 million) fund to finance the generous early
retirement, severance pay and income supplement programs
agreed to in the contract.
   Union President Robert White called the agreement "the
best worker income-security program" in the industry and said
he expects it to become a model for labor negotiations in
other industries.
   The agreement will be the basis for negotiations with the
Canadian unit of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Canada
Ltd. The auto workers' contracts with the Canadian units of
the Big Three auto makers expired Sept. 14. Ford Canada was
the Canadian Auto Worker's target in the pattern-setting
negotiations.
   Mr. White said GM Canada probably will be the next company
the union negotiates with. Nick Hall, a GM Canada spokesman,
said the Ford contract looks expensive, but he declined to
elaborate.
   Chrysler Canada officials declined to comment on the Ford
Canada contract, but analysts said the cash-strapped company
would have difficulty affording such a settlement.
   Chrysler is financially "very weak and there are questions
of whether it could even withstand a strike," Toronto auto
analyst Dennis DesRosiers said earlier in the Ford
negotiations.
   In separate U.S. auto talks, Chrysler already has warned
that it may not be able to match the settlement the United
Auto Workers reached last week with General Motors.
   Ford Canada's chief negotiator, Donald McKenzie, declined
to say how much the agreement will cost the company, but
called it "a handsome settlement" as far as workers are
concerned.
   The contract requires that Ford provide one-year's notice
in the event of a plant closing and six months' notice of job
losses due to technological change or outsourcing -- the
buying of products from outside sources, rather than
producing them inhouse.
   When jobs are lost for these reasons, the contract
provides for early retirement at full pension for older
workers with at least 10 years of service. Depending on
length of service, laid-off workers also may receive 95% of
their income for up to three years, or choose severance
payments of up to C$65,000.
   The union said the compensation plan is designed to
encourage older workers to leave the work force ahead of
younger ones.
   Also in the new settlement is an annual C$500 vacation
bonus for workers, and workers will also get three additional
four-day weekends a year. Mr. White said the extra time off,
a key issue in the talks, is likely to have an influence on
the auto talks in the U.S.
   Ford Canada also agreed to create a "social justice fund"
to make contributions to such things as international
development and relief projects and food banks. The company
will contribute one cent per hour worked to the fund, up to
C$250,000. It will also contribute to the Canadian Auto
Workers' child care program.
