   BRUSSELS -- In late July, a grim delegation of electronics
industry executives gathered in the European Community
Commission's headquarters here.
   The message they delivered in meetings with two commission
vice presidents was blunt: The EC electronics industry is
losing ground in world markets, "and we don't see any
positive reaction by the commission" to help, recalls Peter
Asam, director of external relations for West German
electronics giant Siemens AG, who attended the meetings.

   The message got through. Now, the EC's executive agency is
conducting the most sweeping review of its
electronics-industry policies in a decade. It will help
determine whether the $200 billion European electronics
industry pulls out of its tailspin. It also will influence
the political reception U.S. and Japanese electronics
companies get here in the early 1990s.
   The review will take months, but a few clear policies are
already gaining ascendancy in Brussels, according to EC
Commission officials and industry lobbyists.
   Chief among them is a desire for closer ties to the U.S.,
formerly considered as much a threat to the EC electronics
industry as Japan. A U.S.-EC alliance, commission officials
argue, could help both regions compete with an increasingly
strong Japanese electronics industry. "The political climate
is favorable for cooperation between the {U.S.} and the EC,"
says Michel Carpentier, EC director-general for
electronics-related programs. EC officials hope to agree this
year on some form of collaboration with Washington -- though
the U.S. is undecided on the issue.
   Other proposals gaining ground in Brussels are measures to
stimulate European demand for electronics products. One
possibility involves a massive public works project to link
government computers of all 12 EC member states. The project,
dubbed the European Nervous System, would be the largest
electronics procurement in European history. The EC
Commission already has allocated 380 million European
Currency Units ($504 million) to research such a network. But
now Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC vice president in charge
of science and technology, says he also wants the commission
to help supervise the network's installation.
   A third proposal, overt protectionism, is so far being
rejected in Brussels. Despite industry calls for help, "it
would be an enormous mistake to go to more protectionism,"
says Mr. Pandolfi. Indeed, the EC Commission is considering
proposals to cut import duties on all semiconductors to 9.2%
from 14%, and to eliminate the 5% import duty on computers.
   The source of all this policy foment is the sad state of
European electronics. After hitting a peak European market
share of 43% in 1987, Europe's computer companies are now
losing sales and profits to U.S. and Japanese rivals; this
year, industry pundits expect European manufacturers' share
to fall to 37%. (Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. yesterday announced
plans to cut several thousand jobs as it grapples with the
slowdown in demand in the computer industry and the weak
dollar.)
   The semiconductor industry is shrinking as weak players
cut back; last year, the European industry held just 36.5% of
the European chip market, down from 43.3% in 1979. Partly
because of European phone deregulation, the once-strong EC
telecommunications equipment industry is losing ground. And
the EC's overall electronics trade balance is dismal: Last
year, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, a Geneva-based United Nations agency, the EC's
electronics trade deficit hit a record $27.22 billion.
   Now, Mr. Carpentier says, "We ask ourselves: What might be
done?"
   For starters, he and other EC officials say, the answers
include altering some long-cherished European principles.
Through much of the 1980s, the EC Commission and several EC
member states pursued a policy of Europe for Europeans in
electronics. U.S. and Japanese companies, which control more
than half of the EC's computer and semiconductor markets,
were the challenge against which EC industry had to rally.
The commission pumped about 3 billion ECUs into electronics
research programs with catchy names like Esprit and Race.
Though U.S. and Japanese companies weren't entirely excluded,
they weren't always welcome. The aim was to get EC companies
working together, pooling their strengths.
   Now, however, officials in Brussels and at several EC
capitals are encouraging U.S.-EC collaboration. "We are very
much in favor of a trans-Atlantic partnership," says Klaus
Rupf, director of information technology in Bonn's Ministry
of Research and Technology. "In some areas, I doubt whether
we will be able to solve the strategic challenge of Japan on
our own."
   Signs of this policy switch are numerous. Earlier this
year, politicians in Bonn and Brussels applauded a Siemens
agreement to collaborate with International Business Machines
Corp. in a crucial area of semiconductor technology,
developing 64-megabit dynamic random access memory chips.
Likewise, talks are under way to link the largest European
and U.S. government semiconductor-research programs, Jessi
and Sematech. In high-definition television, the
next-generation TV technology under study world-wide, EC
companies are being urged to seek alliances with U.S.
companies. And the EC Commission wants to sign a memorandum
of understanding soon with the U.S., spelling out other areas
for electronics collaboration.
   But just how far this romance goes depends largely on
Washington -- which can't seem to make up its mind.
   President George Bush's science adviser and the U.S.
National Science Foundation have expressed enthusiasm for
closer EC ties. But the U.S. trade representative and
Commerce Department officials are leery of any agreements
with Brussels that might violate Washington's official taboo
against telling U.S. companies how to run their overseas
businesses.
   Another cherished EC policy that's under review is the
longstanding belief that European manufacturers need help
bolstering their technology. In the 1980s, the big EC
research programs provided 50% subsidies for companies to
collaborate on "pre-competitive" research into basic
semiconductor, computer and telecommunications technologies.
Now, however, EC officials say improving the supply of
European electronics products isn't enough; market demand for
them must also rise. To whet the appetites of corporate
electronics buyers, they say, they now want to involve them
with electronics suppliers in more EC research programs.
   More important and controversial, though, is a Brussels
plan that would put the commission in the driver's seat of
the so-called European Nervous System. The project was pushed
by industry lobbyists last year as part of the 1992 program
for lowering internal trade barriers. If the unified market
is to work, Brussels bureaucrats agreed, the EC members need
to link their customs, police, treasury, air-traffic and
other computers. The five-year budget awarded to the project
in April is for research on the concept only.
   But Mr. Pandolfi, the EC technology commissioner, says "it
isn't enough to promote R&amp;D" on the computer network. He says
"a direct, concerted action of the commission" to establish
the network is needed to get it working -- and to help the
European electronics industry, which would be its main
supplier. The commission, he says, must also "coordinate the
implementation" of the network. In practical terms, EC
officials say, that could mean helping specify the network's
technical details, providing poorer EC states with
regional-aid funds to buy the needed computer gear and
coordinating the network's installation and operation.
   The proposal, which Mr. Pandolfi and EC Internal-Market
Commissioner Martin Bangemann plan to submit to the Council
of Ministers by the end of the year, will stir a political
tempest. Mr. Pandolfi insists the project won't entail any
protectionism or "dirigisme," a French term for government
dictating to industry. But British and Spanish officials have
already begun grumbling that the idea looks suspiciously like
a power-grab by Brussels. Traditionally, public procurement
has been the exclusive province of national governments.
   But the European electronics industry's backing for Mr.
Pandolfi's proposal is overwhelming. "Today, cooperative
research in EC programs isn't enough," argues Bruno
Lamborghini, president of Eurobit, the main European computer
trade association, and vice president for strategy at Italian
computer-maker Olivetti. "We need something that can create a
larger critical mass" in European electronics, he says.
