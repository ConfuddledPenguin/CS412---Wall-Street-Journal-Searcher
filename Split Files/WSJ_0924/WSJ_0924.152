   As an eighth-grade graduation present, Kristina Olson got
new ears from her mother. Leigh Kane, at 17, got a new nose.
   Since last month, Danielle Borngiorno, 14, has had
narrower hips and thinner thighs. Her mother offered to pay
for breast implants, too, but Danielle decided against that,
for the time being. She is still considering chin and nose
work and a cheek implant. "Now, {it's} just like, let's go
every week and get something improved on. There are so many
things you can do," says Danielle, who lives in Brooklyn,
N.Y.

   Why bother with padded bras and Clearasil when silicone
and dermabrasion promise permanence? Why spend one's
adolescence brooding about receding chins or big ears when it
is so simple to have plastic surgery?
   To the dismay of at least some psychologists and medical
doctors, cosmetic surgery is now hardly more exotic than
orthodontics among children whose parents have the
wherewithal to pay $600 or $6,000 for a surgical procedure to
improve on nature. Statistics don't exist, but many plastic
surgeons say their teen-age clientele has doubled in the past
five years and now is as much as 25% of their business.
   Nose and ear jobs remain the most popular operations. But
dermabrasion (sanding off layers of skin), breast
augmentation and liposuction (fat sucking) are coming on
strong with kids, not just with middle-aged entertainers like
Phyllis Diller. Many Asian boys and girls, overeager to
assimilate, seek to reshape the epicanthic fold in their
eyelids. Some black youths, a la Michael Jackson, see
surgeons for narrower noses and thinner lips.
   Observers critical of the phenomenon see in it pampered
children who can't tolerate the pain of being themselves.
They see a society obsessed with appearance and with
narrow-minded notions of what constitutes beauty.
   "I hear doctors defend the right of teens to have
face-lift surgery and eyelid surgery," says Frederick
Stucker, chairman of the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
Department at Louisiana State University, "but I think we
send the wrong message when we're willing to do it for
teens." Dr. Stucker maintains that a lot of operations are
unnecessary because teenage acne, babyfat and other
"problems" usually disappear on their own as kids get older.
   Adds Norman M. Cole, vice president of the American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons: "A real
problem in our society is that parents want everything for
their children. Aesthetic surgery has become a commodity. `I
want my son to have a new stereo, car, nose and chin.' This
is something that deserves some careful interrogation."
Surgery to change racial characteristics, Dr. Cole says, is
"an inappropriate concession to Western images. The Oriental
eye in China is considered the most beautiful in the world.
It's a sad commentary . . ."
   Cosmetic surgeons have their own interests in the matter,
and some of them argue that plastic surgery is a real boon to
teenagers psychologically. Insecurity, self-consciousness and
a lack of self-esteem vanish once the bandages come off.
Surgery can take "years off a psychiatrist's couch," says
Walter Berman, a facial plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills,
Calif.
   "I did two kids {a 14-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy}
this week who had a hereditary bagging of the upper eyelid,"
says Lori Hansen, a plastic surgeon in Oklahoma City, Okla.
"It made them look tired all the time. So we just took the
extra skin and fat away. Things are so easily fixed now. We
don't have to live with them."
   But critics say that in many cases parents are to blame
for wanting "perfectlooking" children, thus encouraging low
self-esteem in their offspring. "We see it often," says
Pearlman D. Hicks, a plastic surgeon in Long Beach, Calif.
"The parent tells the kid, `Your nose looks terrible. You
don't even look like part of the family.' {Parents} plant the
seed and get the kids worried."
   Nose jobs, of course, are nothing new for teen-agers. But
they once were a thing of the affluent and the disfigured.
Now, middle-class people get them almost willy-nilly. They
are a socially acceptable midcourse correction in the life of
an adolescent. New procedures, like liposuction, have been
introduced in the U.S. within the past 10 years and pull in a
lot of patients.
   Many teen-agers who have had cosmetic surgery say they are
glad they did. Why put it off and prolong the agony when they
are likely to have it done eventually anyway?
   "My mom had the same problem. She had something done about
it. I could have waited years, but I did it now," says
Abigail Clawson, 15, speaking of her nose and chin jobs last
April. Abigail, of Westlake Village, Calif., had a bump on
her nose and a receding chin. Nobody ever teased her about
her profile, but for some children, ridicule from schoolmates
can be merciless: "Is that your nose or a banana?" the kids
in Hartshorne, Okla., used to taunt Amanda Andrews, 13. For
years, Amanda would come home from school weeping.
   Explains Lorraine Hollis, Amanda's grandmother and legal
guardian: "She had a great big snoot that slumped down -- and
a little, pointed chin. It gave her a witchy look." Ms.
Hollis took Amanda in for rhinoplasty (nose surgery) and
mentoplasty (a chin implant) on her 13th birthday a year ago
this month. Now, Amanda says, "I'm happier. A lot more guys
ask me out. Even those who teased me now say, `You're looking
better.'"
   Kristina Olson, 20, of Indianapolis, used to hate to go to
school because her "Dumbo" ears, as she refers to them, stuck
out. "I couldn't enjoy life," says Kristina, who would sit in
the back of the classroom and hold her hand over one ear
while covering the other with her hair.
   Finally, her mother took her in for otoplasty -- which, in
effect, pins back protruding ears -- as a gift of "happiness
and mental health." At the age of 16, Kristina entered a new
school and "no one knew the history of my ears." Her
self-esteem and self-confidence soared.
   One young black woman, who doesn't want her name
mentioned, thought her nose was too wide. While she didn't
want to change all her racial features, the 19-year-old
thought a smaller, narrower nose would "enhance" her beauty.
   So, after white friends of hers had had rhinoplasties done
and her own father had the surgery, the Los Angeles resident,
now 21, decided to narrow her nose, too. "I don't think I'm
trying to be white," although she realizes that "a lot of
people see it that way."
   Leigh Kane, of Glen Cove, N.Y., the boy who had the nose
job at 17, says he hadn't realized his nose was out of the
ordinary until his mother told him so two years ago. "I
thought she was kidding. {She said} she noticed that it was
getting progressively worse as I got older," says Leigh, now
19. Suddenly self-conscious, Leigh had a surgeon remove a
bump on his nose and fashion a new tip. And now he feels
better about himself.
   Despite the anecdotal evidence from satisfied young
clients, medical professionals worry that youngsters aren't
prepared to cope with the perils -- physical and
psychological -- of cosmetic surgery.
   "I think the psychological risk among teens is
significantly higher than it is among {the} more mature,"
says Dr. Cole. Often, teen-agers and their parents have
unrealistic expectations that changing appearance will solve
deep-seated problems that require psychiatric attention not
cosmetic surgery.
   Dr. Cole says that several years ago he performed
rhinoplasty on a 16-year-old girl who was ecstatic with the
results at first but later returned complaining that the nose
job hadn't done the trick. She couldn't, however, articulate
exactly what was bothering her. "I think psychologically . .
. that nose wasn't the problem," he says.
   Since most surgical procedures are irreversible, operating
on teen-agers is a heavy responsibility. Patients are
routinely told that things can't be put back the way they
were after the surgery has been done. Patients are counseled
extensively before surgery, so they know the risks involved.
In most states, an 18-year-old can get plastic surgery
without parental consent. Still, some young patients and
their families have regrets.
   Dr. Cole says a colleague operated on the eyelids of an
18-year-old youngster of Korean ancestry who panicked because
his grandparents were angry. "The family was insulted," Dr.
Cole says. They felt that, in having the surgery, the young
man was rejecting his culture. He went back in desperation
seeking to have the surgery undone, but of course it wasn't
possible.
   Doctors say that to be unhappy with one's physical
appearance is simply a part of being a teen-ager, and that
maturity can be the cure. Michael Seifert, 14, of Los
Angeles, has a bump on his nose and a father who is a plastic
surgeon. The son wanted surgery. The father refused on the
grounds that Michael is too young.
   Lately, Michael has found a new girlfriend, who thinks the
bump on his nose gives him "character." He no longer wants to
go under the knife.
