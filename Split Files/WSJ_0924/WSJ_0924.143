   The Illinois Supreme Court issued a decision that could
make it tougher for consumers to collect punitive damages in
product liability cases.
   In the decision last week, which legal experts say
probably will have an impact on other states, the court
reversed a $1.6 million punitive damage award against gun
manufacturer Remington Arms Co., a division of Du Pont Co.,
Wilmington, Del.

   The court said, among other things, that a manufacturer is
not liable for punitive damages if it has investigated prior
accidents involving a product and concluded that the product
is not defective. The company, in this way, would have
demonstrated its good faith in making a safe product.
   The court also said, in essence, that to win punitive
damages the consumer must prove that the product in question
was defective. It isn't enough to argue that the company is
culpable because it did not use the best possible design or
material.
   Mark I. Levy, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on
behalf of the Product Liability Advisory Council, said the
decision might be followed by other state courts. The opinion
"sends a clear message that the standard for punitive damages
should be stringent," said Mr. Levy, an attorney with the
Chicago law firm Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt. "The opinion makes it
clear that such damages are available only in cases of
exceptional wrongdoing on the part of companies."
   But Minneapolis attorney Roger P. Brosnahan, a partner at
Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi, said the opinion indicates
"a conservative trend to narrow the responsibility of
companies toward the public. It sends a message that people
cannot rely on a company that has been informed about a
product's problems to either correct the product or warn the
public about it."
   In the case, a marksman was injured when the barrel of his
Remington 12-gauge shotgun, Model 1100, exploded during a
trapshooting contest in 1983. Claiming that the company knew
about the potential dangers of the gun, the marksman, Robert
Loitz, charged Remington with negligence and misconduct.
   At the trial, testimony disclosed that prior to Mr.
Loitz's accident, the company had received 94 reports of
other barrel explosions involving the same model that
resulted in injuries. The company argued that after
investigating those accidents, it determined that the cause
of the explosions was the type of shell the shooters used,
not an inherent problem in the gun. The company's records of
those investigations had been destroyed, but two longtime
employees testified about the results of the probes.
   A state jury had awarded Mr. Loitz $75,000 in compensatory
damages in addition to the $1.6 million punitive damage award
and an intermediate appellate court upheld the awards.
   Mr. Loitz's attorney, Jon B. Robinson of the Decatur,
Ill., law firm Hull, Campbell &amp; Robinson, could not be
reached.
   William E. Kelly, a lawyer at the Chicago law firm Pope,
Ballard, Shepard &amp; Fowle representing the company, said that
he was pleased with the decision but was "disappointed that
the court didn't also reverse the compensatory damages."

   JUDGE SETS CAP on attorneys' fees in racketeering case.
   A federal judge in Chicago set a $150,000 limit on
attorneys' fees for each of six defendants named in an
indictment charging members of the On Leong Chinese Merchants
Association with operating an illegal gambling business.
   The defendants were among 29 members of the national
association and chapters in Chicago, Houston and New York
charged last month with operating casino-style centers. The
government is seeking $11.5 million in proceeds from the
alleged gambling operations.
   The six defendants are under a court-imposed restraining
order limiting their personal expenditures, because if they
are found guilty their assets are subject to government
forfeiture.
   U.S. District Judge John A. Nordberg modified the
restraining order to exempt attorneys' fees from the
$5,000-a-month limit on spending. Federal prosecutors sought
a cap of $100,000 on attorneys' fees, but the judge ruled in
favor of defense attorneys, who argued that a $150,000 limit
would be reasonable.
   The cap will apply unless the trial, set for April 1,
lasts more than three weeks. Judge Nordberg cautioned defense
attorneys to limit the number of hours they spend on pretrial
matters that can be handled by more junior lawyers and
paralegals.
   Attorneys' fees have become an issue in some racketeering
cases in light of two 1989 U.S. Supreme Court rulings that
forfeiture of the fees is constitutional.

   TEXAS ATTORNEY wins reversal of napping conviction.
   The federal appeals court in New Orleans overturned a
ruling that had found prominent Houston attorney John O'Quinn
guilty of criminal contempt for taking a nap in a jury room
last Nov. 30.
   Mr. O'Quinn took the siesta during a break in a lengthy
and acrimonious case he was trying before U.S. District Judge
David Hittner in Houston. The judge said the nap violated his
Nov. 22 order barring attorneys in the trial from using
courthouse facilities without his permission. He imposed a
10-day jail sentence to be served on weekends, although he
offered to set aside the jail time if Mr. O'Quinn paid a $500
fine and performed 60 hours of community service.
   But last week, a three-judge appeals court panel overruled
Judge Hittner, saying his original order banning the use of
court facilities had been "too vague and overbroad" to
support a criminal contempt conviction. Although Mr. O'Quinn
had exhibited "less than professional conduct" in his dozing,
the panel said, the judge had left "too much doubt" about his
intentions.
   John Braddock, an assistant U.S. attorney who won the
conviction, said he was disappointed by the reversal, but he
didn't expect any further action in the case. Mr. O'Quinn
didn't return telephone calls.

   NEW JERSEY SETTLES sex bias dispute between two judges.
   Elinor Reiner, an administrative law judge in New Jersey,
was paid $220,000 to settle a sex discrimination and sexual
harassment suit she brought against her ex-boss, Ronald
Parker, a judge who formerly ran the state's Office of
Administrative Law. The office was also a defendant.
   As part of the terms of the settlement, neither defendant
admitted wrongdoing. Jerry Fischer, a senior deputy attorney
general with the state, said, "We strongly dispute each and
every one of the claims."
   Ms. Reiner's suit was filed in federal court in Newark,
N.J., in 1988. The suit alleged that Judge Parker, the former
acting director and chief administrative law judge,
repeatedly suggested they have sex and made other sexual
statements.
   As punishment for rejecting his advances, Judge Parker
assigned Judge Reiner dull cases and wrote a job performance
review that led to her getting a small raise in salary, the
suit alleged. Judge Reiner also charged that male judges were
paid substantially more than their female counterparts.
   An attorney for Judge Parker couldn't be reached. An
attorney for Judge Reiner declined to comment.

   STUDENT-LOAN INQUIRY leads to conviction of ex-official at
Florida thrift.
   A federal jury in Tampa, Fla., convicted Jeffrey A.
Flatten of conspiring to defraud the U.S. Department of
Education in connection with its Guaranteed Student Loan
Program. The program makes low-interest loans available to
students for college expenses.
   Mr. Flatten, who headed Florida Federal Savings Bank's
student-loan division, first came under scrutiny in 1988 when
the thrift was investigated for allegedly filing as many as
17,000 fraudulent insurance claims to the government on $35
million in student loans.
   Federal officials in Florida characterized the case as the
largest student-loan fraud ever prosecuted. Mr. Flatten
couldn't be reached for comment.
