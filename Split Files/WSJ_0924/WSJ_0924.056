   PARIS -- Groupe Michelin surprised analysts by posting a
larger-than-expected loss for this year's first half.
   Michelin, which became the world's biggest tire company
when it acquired Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. this year, posted
a first-half loss of 363 million francs ($68.7 million), and
warned that the second half is looking even worse. It said a
loss is likely for the full year.

   Michelin said first-half sales declined 4.4% to 27.22
billion francs. It blamed the decline on currency
fluctuations.
   The loss compares to a 1.46 billion-franc profit in 1989's
first half, and a 2.45 billion-franc profit for all of 1989.
Michelin said it is making a large effort to return to
profitability in 1991.
   As with other tire makers, it blamed the loss on heavy
price competition, on sluggish auto sales in both the U.S.
and Europe, on rising costs and on a plan announced in June
to cut its French labor force by 2,260 people. To cover
severance, early retirement and retraining costs, it made a
special 350-million franc provision.
   One problem Michelin didn't point to is finance.
Michelin's more than $1.5 billion Uniroyal Goodrich
acquisition has pushed up its already heavy debt. Net finance
charges in the first half jumped to 1.06 billion francs, more
than double the year-earlier figure.
   Michelin did warn, however, that because the acquisition
was completed in May, the impact of interest payments on its
results would be more severe in the second half.
   Michelin said in a statement that efforts to cut
production, stocks and overhead would be "pursued and
reinforced.
