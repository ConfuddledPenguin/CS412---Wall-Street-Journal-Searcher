   NEW ORLEANS -- Tidewater Inc. proposed to acquire
Petroleum Helicopters Inc. in a stock swap valued at about
$195 million, plus the assumption of about $30 million of
debt.
   Tidewater provides supply and other vessels for use in the
offshore oil and gas industry and provides compression
services to the natural gas industry. Petroleum Helicopters
provides transportation services for that industry through
the use of its 289-helicopter fleet.

   A spokesman for Petroleum Helicopters' New Orleans offices
couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
   Tidewater said that the purchase and incorporation of
Petroleum Helicopters' aircraft into its operations would
strengthen its position in the marine services segment
world-wide.
   Under the proposed plan, Tidewater would give holders of
Petroleum Helicopters' voting and nonvoting common stock
about $32 of Tidewater common for each Petroleum Helicopters
share held and assume about $30 million of that company's
debt, Tidewater's chairman and chief executive officer, John
P. Laborde, said. Tidewater had about 28.5 million shares
outstanding and about $89 million of long-term debt at June
30.
   Petroleum Helicopters has a combined total of about 5.1
million voting and nonvoting common shares. The company
reported net income of about $10 million on revenue of
roughly $188 million for the fiscal year ended April 30.
Assets totaled about $137.7 million at July 31.
