   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. sold 36 branches
of City Savings Bank, a Somerset, N.J., thrift with $8.3
billion in assets, to two financial institutions.
   City Savings' 27 branches in Florida were sold to Great
Western Bank, Beverly Hills, Calif., a unit of Great Western
Financial Corp. The nine offices in the Camden, N.J., area
were sold to First Fidelity Bank, South Jersey, which is
based in Burlington, N.J., and is a unit of First Fidelity
Bancorporation.

   In addition, City Savings' 66 remaining branches in New
Jersey will be reopened today as a newly chartered federal
mutual association. These branches will maintain normal
business operations while the RTC negotiates a permanent
resolution.
   Great Western, which will assume about $938 million of
deposits, paid the RTC a premium of about $9.8 million. First
Fidelity will assume about $468 million of deposits and paid
the RTC a $9.1 million premium. The RTC will advance $1.4
billion to the acquirers, and estimates that the transaction
will ultimately cost the RTC $1.5 billion.
   The RTC also announced that it sold most of the branches
of failed Great American Savings &amp; Loan Association, Oak
Park, Ill., with $623 million in assets, to two banks. First
National Bank of Chicago will acquire Great American's 13
Chicago branches, and First Financial Bank, Stevens Point,
Wis., will acquire the thrift's three branches in Peoria,
Ill. The RTC estimated its cost for the transaction to be
$71.8 million.
   Separately, the Office of Thrift Supervision reported that
withdrawals at the nation's savings and loans exceeded
deposits by $9.65 billion in April, the nation's thrift
regulator said. A month earlier, withdrawals exceeded
deposits by $958 million, the smallest deposit outflow in
eight months.
   A spokesman for the OTS said most of the outflows occurred
in California, where banks competed aggressively for deposits
in that month.
   The outflow of deposits also reflects, in part, the thrift
industry's shrinking efforts to meet new capital
requirements. The S&amp;Ls needn't hold as much capital if they
reduce their deposits. The number of S&amp;L associations also
shrank to 2,492 in April from 2,716 a year earlier.
