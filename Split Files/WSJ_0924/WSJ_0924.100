   TOKYO -- Japanese government officials will visit
Washington this week to discuss increasing defense technology
transfers to the U.S.
   The meetings stem from a series of talks held over the
past two years, but appear increasingly pressing because of
the Persian Gulf crisis, which has stirred American demands
for more military support from Japan.

   The two sides will discuss at least 10 specific
technologies during the Pentagon meetings Thursday and Friday
, Col. Edwin A. Hind, chief of the U.S. government's Mutual
Defense Assistance Office in Japan, said in an interview.
They include three proposals by Japan during the most recent
such formal set of talks in 1988, and seven more suggested by
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney during a trip here earlier
this year.
   "Beyond that, there may be some more ideas," Col. Hind
said. "We're continuously interested in presenting new agenda
items."
   He refused to identify the technologies under
consideration, but the Japanese press has widely reported the
list, which ranges from missile seekers to military-use
semiconductors.
   A spokesman for Japan's Defense Agency confirmed that
bilateral meetings are scheduled to explore "joint research
between the U.S. and Japan" but said he didn't know any more
details.
   Col. Hind said he didn't know how receptive the Japanese
would be to the American list, but one U.S. official familiar
with the pending talks said their success probably would be
limited, as many of the technologies are controlled by
Japanese industry and not the Japanese government. He
speculated that, at best, the JDA could facilitate ties
between U.S. and Japanese companies.
   The discussions, labeled the Systems and Technology Forum,
aren't formal negotiations and don't require a bilateral
agreement. The likely result of the talks will be the
establishment of working groups in each of the technology
areas that the two countries want to work on.
   The U.S. and Japan have talked for a decade about trying
to balance the outflow of American technology, as Japan has
raced ahead in certain technological fields. In addition,
many Americans argue that Japan should share more of the
burden for its military protection, and that debate has
intensified during the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But the two sides have taken little specific action. Japan
did in 1983 decide to exempt the U.S. from a postwar ban on
military exports, but government and industry reluctance
lingered.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials, despite their rhetoric, haven't
made the issue a top priority. The Defense Department
recently appointed Albert J. Kelley to fill the long-vacant
post of deputy undersecretary for international programs, who
oversees such matters. He apparently pushed to hold the
meetings this month, even though many officials familiar with
the process had earlier said the forum talks couldn't take
place until November at the earliest.
