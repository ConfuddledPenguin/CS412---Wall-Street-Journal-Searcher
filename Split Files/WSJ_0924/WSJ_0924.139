   Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., facing profit
pressures, intends to continue trimming the operations of its
unprofitable Marine Midland Bank operation in the U.S., John
Gray, deputy chairman of the Hong Kong-based banking concern,
said.
   The work force at Marine Midland, based in Buffalo, N.Y.,
has been cut by 1,400, or 10%, in the past year, Mr. Gray
said. Its monthly operating costs have fallen to $70 million
from $78 million at year end, and he said the figure will be
lower by the end of 1990.

   Mr. Gray also said profitability at Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
Banking, which owns large stakes in four Middle Eastern
banks, hasn't been seriously affected by the Persian Gulf
crisis. The company doesn't have operations in Kuwait or
Iraq, he said, but does have "some exposure" to Kuwaiti
banks, which he didn't specify. Hongkong Bank owns British
Bank of the Middle East, 40% stakes in Saudi British Bank and
Hongkong Egyptian Bank SAE, and 21% of Cyprus Popular Bank
Ltd.
