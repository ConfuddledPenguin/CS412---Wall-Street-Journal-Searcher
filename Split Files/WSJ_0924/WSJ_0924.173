   PARIS -- The top French broadcasting authority will
examine proposals this week for a power reshuffle in
faltering young television station La Cinq.
   But the plans, put to the Supreme Audiovisual Council last
Friday, could run into problems because they hand control of
the station to Hachette, a media group that already owns a
hefty chunk of French publishing and broadcasting interests.

   The Council warned Hachette earlier this year, when it
acquired an initial 22% stake in La Cinq, that it was
concerned by the concentration of media power. According to
the proposals now on the table, Hachette would raise its
stake to 25% and friendly banks would take a further combined
20%, giving it effective majority control.
   At the same time publisher Robert Hersant, the controlling
shareholder who submitted the reshuffle plans to the Council,
would cut his stake to 10% from 25%. Under French law, no
shareholder may own more than a quarter of any television
channel's capital.
   The future of unprofitable La Cinq, which began
broadcasting in 1986, has been up in the air since Mr.
Hersant successfully fought off last year's bid for control
by Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi and French
businessman Jerome Seydoux. Their failure gave Hachette
chairman Jean-Luc Lagardere, who has been seeking a role in
French television for several years, his opportunity to move
in, acquiring 22% of the station in May.
   Mr. Hersant, whose press empire includes Le Figaro, one of
France's largest newspapers, was also believed to be
disenchanted with the channel's poor financial performance.
Despite heavy investment, audience ratings remain low at La
Cinq and the station is estimated to be running a 2.2 billion
franc ($416.9 million) deficit this year.
