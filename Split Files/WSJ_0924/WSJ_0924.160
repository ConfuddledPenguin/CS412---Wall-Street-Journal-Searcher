   CINCINNATI -- Jacor Communications Inc. said certain
warrant holders have agreed to defer payments due them to
next Friday.
   The deferrment enables Jacor to continue discussions with
such warrant holders and other creditors to restructure
Jacor's obligations. Those warrant holders had previously
agreed to defer payments due them to last Thursday.
