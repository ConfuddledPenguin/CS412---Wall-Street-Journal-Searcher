   Adolph Coors Co., as expected, approved the formation of a
holding company and called for a special shareholders'
meeting Oct. 18 to get shareholder approval of the change.
   Coors, based in Golden, Colo., said the legal step created
a corporate structure that conforms to the way it has been
doing business for about two years. The holding-company
approval was expected at the annual meeting last spring, but
the paper work wasn't completed in time.

   Under the new corporate structure, Coors's businesses will
operate as units of the holding company, increasing their
management autonomy and financial independence, Coors said.
The units include Coors Brewing Co., Coors Ceramics Co.,
Golden Aluminum Co., Graphic Packaging Corp., Coors BioTech
Inc., Coors Energy Co. and Golden Technologies Co.
