   PARIS -- Following in the army's footsteps, the French
government's military shipbuilding bureaucracy is trying to
become just a little less governmental, by setting up a
commercial export subsidiary.
   It is all part of a push by arms makers world-wide to
boost sales and improve sagging financial performance. It
also reflects a growing effort by French state agencies to
begin behaving more like companies.

   Earlier this year, the French government's main maker of
munitions, cannons, tanks and armored vehicles shortened its
long, complicated name to Giat Industries. It ceased to be a
state agency and became a corporation -- albeit still
government-owned. It immediately announced plans to stem
losses, expand slumping exports, and lay off employees.
   The shipbuilders' goal is more modest. They don't want to
become a corporation or lay anyone off. They just want the
right to create a commercially registered sales subsidiary
called DCNI, short for Direction des Constructions
Navales-Industrie. Then they want to begin an export drive.
   Until now, the DCN says, it has viewed its main job simply
as supplying the French navy. It designs ships and oversees
plants that build them.
   It has been treated as another government bureaucracy, and
had to go through a cumbersome process to make an export
sale. The result has been poor export performance. The DCN
won't say exactly how much of its 20 billion francs ($3.79
billion) in sales last year were exports, but says exports
were well below Giat's figure of 10% of total production.
   A spokesman says the DCN hopes the Finance Ministry will
approve the new company within a few weeks. First, the DCN
needs to calm official worries that the new company would
mark a step away from full government control.
   The DCN's idea is similar to Giat's: Boost efficiency and
build cooperation with non-government companies, both French
and foreign. And while the DCN doesn't calculate profits and
losses, it would want its sales subsidiary to show earnings.
   "Currently," the DCN official said, "we don't have the
right to form joint ventures or to handle our own export
sales. We must build and design ships and subs ourselves, and
when we want to sell abroad, we have to work through one of
the state export agencies. We are hoping to get more
flexibility."
   The official said the DCN has been lobbying for more than
two years to create the company. The changes at Giat have
made the change seem more urgent.
   Giat Chairman Pierre Chiquet said in April that he hopes
to cut staff more than 10% by 1992. He said he hopes to end
losses, now 10% of sales, by 1994. And this month, he said
Giat has agreed to cooperate with a division of General
Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., (unrelated to the British
company of the same name), to develop and make a cannon
turret for light helicopters, which they hope to sell to the
U.S. Army.
