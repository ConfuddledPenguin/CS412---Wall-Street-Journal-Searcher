   BEIJING -- China's foreign trade dropped 2.04% in the
first eight months of this year, because imports fell 16% to
$32.08 billion, compared with year-earlier levels, the
official Xinhua News Agency said, citing customs figures.
Exports rose 15% to $36.27 billion.
   In August, exports grew 15% and imports fell 10% from a
year earlier. The data exclude items imported for foreign
investment and raw materials exchanged for processing.

   The drop in imports is part of China's strict government
austerity program instituted in late 1988 to bring down
inflation that peaked at nearly 40%. Imports of foreign
cigarettes, liquor, luxury cars and certain electronics have
all been banned. August prices rose only 2.7% from a year
earlier.
