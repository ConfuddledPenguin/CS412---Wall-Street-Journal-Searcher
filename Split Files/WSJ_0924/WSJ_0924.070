   BREAKING BRITAIN'S SPEED LIMIT

   Two Japanese car makers and one from France reportedly
have been warned not to glamorize speed and high performance
in advertising and selling their models in Britain.
   According to a Japanese news agency, Britain's Advertising
Standards Authority has criticized Nissan Motor Co. and
Toyota Motor Corp., along with the French manufacturer
Renault S.A., for emphasizing the ability of their cars to
reach speeds of 155 miles an hour. This is more than twice
the 70 mph speed limit that applies on all British motorways.
   A spokesman for the authority was quoted by the news
agency as saying that ads stressing speed and glamorizing
power appeared to have come back in fashion after being
dropped some years ago. "We will be keeping a very close eye
on car advertisements in future," the spokesman reportedly
added.
   An official of the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Accidents, noting that there was ample evidence that speed
was a major factor in traffic fatalities, said: "We are very
pleased the authority is getting tough with emotional
language in car adverts which leads to aggressive driving."
                                                                                                       

   A LOAN FOR SHANGHAI VOLKSWAGEN
                                                                                                       

   Shanghai Volkswagen reportedly signed an agreement with
China's Bank of Industry &amp; Commerce to borrow 128 million
yuan (about $27 million) to be used for Chinese-made parts.
Shanghai's Liberation Daily said the loan also would serve as
a "shot in the arm," enabling Shanghai VW to complete its
1990 production plan. The report called Shanghai VW the "pet
of the Shanghai financial community." Shanghai VW is a joint
venture of Shanghai Automobile &amp; Tractor Industries and
Volkswagen AG.
                                                                                                       

   HELPING NORTHERN IRELAND
                                                                                                       

   The European Community said it would give 35 million
European currency units ($45.9 million) to projects in
Northern Ireland. The money is being targeted for
infrastructure projects as well as various social programs
trying to reconcile the province's Roman Catholic and
Protestant communities. The EC commissioner for regional
policy, Bruce Millan, said: "The (EC) itself was born out of
the need to resolve conflict and achieve reconciliation, and
it is appropriate that it should today seek to help Northern
Ireland in the same way."
                                                                                                       

   GATT DOORS SHUT ON CHINA
                                                                                                       

   A Beijing delegation failed in its latest attempt to gain
China's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the global trading organization. China, which has
observer status in the GATT and has been trying to gain
membership for some eight years, has been told that it has to
open up its markets more to foreign trade and reduce tariffs
before it can be considered. Beijing's bid for recognition
also was set back considerably by last year's Tiananmen
Square killings.
                                                                                                       

   MORE PRIVATIZING IN PORTUGAL
                                                                                                       

   The Portuguese government will sell its minority holdings
in 34 companies, the news agency Lusa reported. The assets,
in each case less than 10% of a company, are to be sold
through direct negotiation with potential buyers, a Finance
Ministry spokesman said; current shareholders may be granted
preferential rights. The companies involved run the gamut
from beer maker Companhia de Cervejas Estrela S.A. to the
national zoo.
                                                                                                       

   LINKING SEOUL AND BELGRADE
                                                                                                       

   Yugoslavia and South Korea will establish the first-ever
air link between the two countries, a Yugoslav news agency
reported. Yugoslav Airlines plans to open a direct link
between Belgrade and Seoul by the end of this year, and
Korean Air is expected to fly to Belgrade soon thereafter,
the report said.
                                                                                                       

   THE FUTURE OF EUROPE'S ELDERLY
                                                                                                       

   Europe's old people may have to go back to work, reversing
the current trend toward early retirement, as families shrink
and a labor shortfall looms, according to papers discussed at
a recent Council of Europe workshop.
   And as a trend toward very small families continues, the
many over-65s expected by the year 2025 -- more than 20% in
Sweden, West Germany and the Netherlands against half that
figure now -- will likely experience increasing social
isolation due to the absence of family ties.
   "The picture isn't all black," said Italian demographer
Raimondo Cagiano Azevedo. "The gray revolution is the result
of medical improvements and a change in life styles, such as
women joining the labor force. . . . But there will be
problems if governments fail to adopt a long-term strategy."
   Like other demographers at the seminar, Mr. Azevedo urged
a quick overhaul of national welfare systems to cater to
growing numbers of the "old old" -- those over 75 years. By
2025, they are expected to account for 8% of people in
Britain, France and Switzerland.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPT . . .
                                                                                                       

   In the first six months of this year, China confiscated
195 pounds of opium, an amount 17 times greater than in the
same period last year.
