   School days are upon us, as well as the threat of lawsuits
by the American Civil Liberties Union to undermine school
order and discipline. A student showed up at East Islip High
School on Long Island wearing a T-shirt inscribed with the
legend, "Adolf Hitler European Tour 1939-1945." He removed it
under threat of suspension, and went to the ACLU. Attorney
David Jampol threatened suit, declaring, "This is definitely
a free speech issue." We think school officials should be
allowed to run the schools. To preserve and display every
species of free speech, the ACLU could always open a zoo.
