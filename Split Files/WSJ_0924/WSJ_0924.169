   John and Jane Doe need cellular phones. The idea just
hasn't rung a bell with them yet.
   But most mobile phone companies are hoping it will.
They're looking for ordinary consumers as they aim to expand
their market beyond business and professional customers. The
strategies range from cuts in monthly charges to photos
making comparisons to microwave ovens and TV ads featuring
storms and smashups.

   Companies yearning for Ordinary Joes offer free emergency
road service and free long-distance calling on weekends.
Others try to bait the hook with cheap equipment rentals.
   Of the 4.4 million Americans with mobile phones, the vast
majority use them for business. Last year, they laid out
nearly $2 billion on cellular calls. This year, the revenue
volume is expected to reach $3.2 billion. (For the average
subscriber, that translates into a monthly bill of about
$89.)
   But a recent survey suggests how quickly the cellular
landscape could change. Conducted by Yankelovich Clancy
Shulman for Nynex Corp., the survey covered consumers with
income of more than $25,000 a year; it found that one in
every four, or about 27 million, will probably buy a cellular
phone in the next five years. About six million of those
expect to purchase one in the next 12 months.
   But costs have kept lots of people off the cellular
bandwagon. Drivers who would need a cellular phone only for
an occasional quick call have little in common with the
businessman who makes calls almost at will and passes the tab
along to his employer.
   Cellular phone owners find their wallets being drained in
inventive ways. There are high monthly charges and pricey
phone sets. For low-volume corporate customers, the cost of a
cellular telephone call during business hours ranges from 60
cents to 75 cents a minute. Off peak, a minute can cost 10
cents to 35 cents. But customers don't just get charged when
they make a call; they also get billed for each call they
receive. Furthermore, they must pay about a dime for every
busy signal and every unanswered call.
   "The consumer market is very difficult," concedes Bruce
Amundson, an official of U S West Inc.'s NewVector Group
unit. "We're still conducting research to figure out what
type of person would be a consumer and how much they're
willing to pay."
   Frederick Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc.,
with responsibility for heavy investments in cellular
companies, cautions that a real consumer boom won't happen
until calling rates drop rather sharply. "Then you'll find
everyone using car phones," he says, "and the cellular
companies will be carrying enormous amounts of traffic."
   Those days look just too far off to some players.
Nonbusiness use, they say, still generates far too few phone
calls and far too little revenue. "We do not view cellular
phones as a consumer device, nor do we market them that way,"
says Don Harris, vice president of corporate development for
Pacific Telesis Group's PacTel Cellular unit. "For the
foreseeable future, we see it as a business productivity
tool. Maybe 30 years down the road, it will be for consumers.
But it isn't yet."
   The enthusiasts aren't waiting.
   Take Metrophone, a joint venture of McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. and Metromedia Inc. It recently slashed
the basic monthly service charge for casual users by 33% to
$9.95. Metrophone's monthly fees for heavy-use business
customers can run as high as $155.
   Most of the Baby Bells are jumping in, too. Their new ad
campaigns and department-store distributors talk up the
themes that consumers like to hear: affordability, security
and convenience.
   In 1984, when cellular phone sets cost about $3,000
apiece, only about 5% of Bell Atlantic Corp.'s subscribers
were nonbusiness users. To appeal to more consumers, Bell
Atlantic now offers about three hours of talk time a month
for $14.95.
   Ameritech's Mobile Communications unit is swaying
consumers with phone rentals that are practically free. For
$5 a month, consumer can have an installed cellular telephone
with speaker phone and memory dialing. A portable unit costs
only a few dollars more.
   Some phone companies appeal to another popular consumer
emotion: fear. McCaw, Ameritech, Nynex, U S West and others
run ads that all show a car careening off the road during a
severe storm. Such ads swayed Bruce McGrath, a salesman in
New York, to buy a cellular phone for his wife. "I didn't
want her to get stranded in the car in some godforsaken
place," he says.
   Cellular companies also are using department stores,
electronics retailers and auto-supply shops to zoom in on
consumers. "We're making cellular phones available in places
where consumers like to shop," says Steve Lamont, corporate
director of marketing at McCaw.
   Southwestern Bell Corp., which recently created some ads
that show a mom on the phone in the car with her kids, also
has shifted some of its print budget off the sports and
business pages to reach a wider audience.
   In April, BellSouth Corp.'s BellSouth Mobility tested a
"Security Plus" program in South Florida that, for $35 a
month, gave new customers 20 minutes of airtime, free
emergency road service and night rates of 10 cents a minute.
The program boosted new-customer sales by about 30%, and
BellSouth wants to integrate it into other markets. McCaw
says it may introduce similar plans.
   One BellSouth ad shows a cellular phone below a VCR and a
microwave oven. The appliances, now in most U.S. households,
once were considered "gadgets that few people would ever need
and even fewer could ever afford," the ad text says.
   The ad concludes: "You get the idea."
