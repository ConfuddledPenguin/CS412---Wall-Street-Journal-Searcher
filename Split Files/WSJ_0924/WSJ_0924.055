   Pittsburgh -- Big steel made big money for young
businessmen, who built palatial homes at the turn of the
century along Millionaire's Row here. But like the sprawling
mills of that bygone era, those houses have all but
disappeared. Only one remains: Clayton, the home of the late
coke and steel magnate Henry Clay Frick.
   It was here in this 23-room stone mansion that Frick
raised his children while ruling the country's emerging steel
industry. Steel made Frick rich, but it also made
Pittsburgh's air black. So the plutocrat art aficionado fled
the soot: He packed up his family and his Rembrandts and
Raphaels and moved them to New York in 1905 for safekeeping.
He turned his back on Clayton, leaving it untouched.

   "It was as if they were going for the weekend," says
Joanne Moore, project director of the restoration. They left
behind furniture, linens, papers, books, games and closets
full of clothes -- some 12,000 items that gathered dust for
decades.
   Daughter Helen, who inherited Clayton in the 1930s, kept
staff there to cook her favorite dinners on her rare visits.
She spent the last four years of her life at Clayton,
bedridden in her childhood nursery. And before she died in
1984, at the age of 96, she directed that Clayton be
maintained as "a historic house and estate," with everything
"nearly as possible like it was in the days when the family
lived there."
   Now, after a five-year, $6 million restoration, Clayton
opened this weekend as a museum. A walk inside is a walk into
the 19th century. Downstairs in the parlor, where guests were
received, rococo Louis XV-style chairs are covered with
floral-patterned tapestry. Upstairs are Henry and wife
Adelaide Frick's separate but adjoining bedrooms -- his neat
and spartan, hers a lush retreat decorated entirely in red,
including a red-painted ceiling bordered with gold
cornflowers.
   Unlike many other restorations on this scale, Clayton
feels like a family home. Its high-ceilinged, Victorian rooms
are filled with everyday things -- Henry's spectacles on the
library desk where he poured over business records,
Adelaide's silver-topped dresser set and Christmas shopping
lists from 1896, a hand-carved ivory domino set, children's
toys and family photographs. "You can feel their
personalities and presence in these rooms," says Thierry
Despont, the New York architect who worked on the
restoration.
   Henry Clay Frick was 33 years old and already a
millionaire when he and his young bride moved to Clayton in
1882. The son of a ne'er-do-well farmer, he'd had little
formal schooling but shrewdly perceived there was lots of
money to be made supplying the burgeoning steel industry with
coke. By the time he was 30, he'd purchased huge tracts of
coal fields and controlled much of the coke industry.
   Andrew Carnegie, eager to secure a ready supply of coke
for his mills, invited Frick to become his partner. There was
little friendship between the demanding, gregarious Carnegie
and the dour, formal Frick, but Henry quickly proved himself
the master manager. He streamlined Carnegie's steel
empire-cutting costs by consolidating operations and
constructing a company-owned railway to connect widely
scattered plants.
   But it was the bloody Homestead strike of 1892 for which
he's most remembered. When the plant's workers went on
strike, Frick hired strikebreakers and Pinkerton guards to
break their walkout, and persuaded the governor to send in
state militia. Workers were shot at and Homestead became an
armed camp.
   An angry anarchist then tried to assassinate Frick. Two of
his bullets hit their target, but failed to injure Frick
seriously. He insisted on having his wounds treated in his
office and then went about his business duties as if nothing
had happened.
   He continued to hang tough with the strikers -- and
ultimately broke their union. One liberal senator later
commented that the industrialist was "coldblooded" and
"absolutely without any trace of sympathy for the working
man."
   At Clayton, a different man emerges -- a loving husband
and father whose home was a safe refuge from the harsh
business world. Unlike today's jet-age executives, he seems
to have spent a great deal of time at home. He usually was
there promptly at 6 for dinner in the formal dining room
furnished with rich mahogany woodwork, silver-plated lighting
fixtures and a table that seated 20.
   "My father and I sat at one end of the table, my mother at
the other, and during the meal the orchestrian {a mechanical
instrument with the sounds of a full orchestra} played
favorite tunes," Helen later recalled. After dinner, there
were games of bridge or dominos in the second-floor library,
"where my parents spent the evenings when alone, their big
armchairs drawn up in front of the gas-log fire," Helen
wrote. And when her father "got the fidgets during the
evening, he and I would take a walk, arm in arm, first on one
floor, then on another, steering our way around furniture."
   There are family photos everywhere at Clayton --
especially of Martha, the oldest daughter, who died in 1891
at age five after a long illness. For the rest of his life,
Henry placed flowers over Martha's portrait in his bedroom,
as he continued to grieve the death of his "Rose Bud."
   Despite that grief, Helen Clay Frick remembered her
childhood at Clayton as an idyllic time. She had everything a
child could want -- dolls from France, ponies and carriages
and a playhouse filled with miniature furniture that she
shared with her older brother, Childs. Among her parents'
friends, her favorites were bankers and neighbors Andrew W.
and Richard Beatty Mellon who, after talking business with
her father, would share tea with her and her dolls.
   Helen left strict instructions (and plenty of funds) to
restore Clayton to the way it was in those happy years. No
detail has been overlooked.
   A limestone carver -- one of 200 craftsmen hired for the
restoration -- handcarved 129 balusters to replace
deteriorated railing along the second-floor porch. A paint
specialist analyzed interior walls; in Mrs. Frick's bedroom,
scrapings were taken from behind the fireplace mantle to
determine the original shade of red.
   Only one panel of original drapery fabric remained for the
bedroom windows. Using a bill dated 1896, archivists at
Clayton traced the fabric to a textile maker in Lyon, France.
The company still exists and was able to duplicate the
fabric. Similarly, the library's stenciled jute wallcovering,
found almost in shreds, was reordered from its original
Parisian maker.
   It's hard to say whether Helen would embrace the
refurbished Clayton. Like her father, whom she idolized, she
was used to getting her way -- and retaliated when she
didn't. In the 1960s, when directors of an art building she'd
donated to the University of Pittsburgh announced plans to
exhibit modern art, she withdrew her Renaissance art
collection and built her own Frick Art Museum adjacent to
Clayton.
   When it came to Clayton itself, Helen hoped to control the
place even after her death. She especially wanted to keep a
tight rein on visitors to her family's shrine. In her will,
she stated that the public should stand behind gates at the
entrance to each room. But the foundation to which she's
entrusted Clayton is ignoring that dictum because "to
experience the rooms and the life lived in them, you can't
block them off," says project director Ms. Moore.
