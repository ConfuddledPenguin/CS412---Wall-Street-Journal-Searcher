   NEW YORK -- Rare-coin dealers want the government to know:
We can police ourselves.
   Following a crackdown on rare-coin fraud by federal and
state regulators, leaders of the coin business have called an
unusual "summit" to launch the industry's first
self-regulatory organization.

   "The industry is in a state of panic that the federal
government will regulate it," says Bruce Kaplan, president of
Kaplan &amp; Co., a Santa Monica, Calif., company that advises
coin dealers. "They're scrambling to come up with a
regulatory program that the {government} will tacitly
approve," he says.
   The planned summit follows last month's crackdown by the
Federal Trade Commission on Professional Coin Grading Service
Inc. -- which heralded itself as making the coin business
safer for investors. The FTC accused the grading service of
making false and misleading claims. Professional Coin settled
the charges without admitting or denying them.
   The summit, to be held early next month in Long Beach,
Calif., is aimed at setting up a self-regulatory body that
will establish safeguards for rare-coin customers and ethical
standards for coin dealers, grading services, auction houses
and other parts of the $5 billion-a-year coin industry.
   There's been scattered talk in the past among coin dealers
of a self-policing body. But the industry believes it has to
act now because of the negative publicity generated by the
recent FTC action and other FTC lawsuits against coin
dealers.
   "We better do something to get a positive image going, or
else we're going to turn back into a little cottage industry
and never have the chance to be a real financial market,"
says Frederic Tordella, president of MTB Banking Corp., a
large New York coin dealer.
   Besides trying to mollify regulators with its
self-policing plan, the rare-coin industry wants to reassure
a skittish Wall Street. Securities firms -- which have been
moving into the coin business by selling rare-coin funds and
partnerships -- now are worried about the regulatory pressure
on the coin business.
   "We want to make our industry more attractive to more
traditional investors, particularly Wall Street," says Barry
Stuppler, co-chairman of the summit organizing committee.
