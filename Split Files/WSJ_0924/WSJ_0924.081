   CHICAGO -- Aon Corp. dropped its unsolicited $40-a-share
bid for Corroon &amp; Black Corp., in the face of continued
resistance from the New York insurance broker.
   Aon's cash proposal, which valued Corroon at about $840
million, had challenged a stock-swap accord under which
Corroon had previously agreed to merge with Willis Faber PLC
of London.

   Corroon, which under terms of the pact with Willis was
free to accept a superior bid if one surfaced, opted to
rebuff the Aon proposal in favor of the merger with the UK
concern. While Aon's bid offers Corroon shareholders more
cash, the combination with Willis would provide Corroon with
a valuable international presence, Corroon said.
   Aon initially said it wasn't interested in pursuing a bid
if it was opposed by Corroon's board. But when Corroon last
week turned down the proposal without giving Aon officials a
hearing, the company announced its offer was "still on the
table." But later in the week, Aon signalled again that it
wouldn't pursue an unfriendly acquisition, and on Thursday
Corroon again refused to meet with Aon officials to discuss
the proposal.
   Aon's Richard Miller, chairman and chief executive
officer, wrote to Corroon &amp; Black's Patrick G. Ryan,
chairman, chief executive officer, saying that Aon's offer
was superior to Willis Faber's offer. He expressed his
disappointment in Corroon's opposition to his company's offer
and the letter was to inform Corroon that Aon would withdraw
its proposal.
   Aon wanted to blend its Rollins Burdick unit with
Corroon's operations, which would have created the
fourth-largest insurance brokerage in the world. But the deal
with Willis will establish a slightly larger brokerage, of
similar world rank.
   Corroon shareholders formally vote on the proposed merger
with Willis Sept. 28.
   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. declined to comment on Aon's
withdrawal.
   Even before Aon formally announced that it was withdrawing
its bid, Corroon shares had been weakening. "The stock is
down because the stock market is convinced that the Willis
Faber deal will go through and it's just worth $30 a share,"
said Michael Smith, an insurance industry analyst with Lehman
Brothers, a unit of New York-based Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc.
