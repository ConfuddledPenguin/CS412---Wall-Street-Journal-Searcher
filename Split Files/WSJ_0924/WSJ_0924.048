   WASHINGTON -- Japan averted a trade investigation by
agreeing to buy thousands of electric transformers containing
new alloys developed by Allied-Signal Inc. and to respect the
U.S. company's patent rights.
   The agreement was reached Friday after a week of talks
here to craft concessions that would persuade the Morristown,
N.J., company not to refile its trade complaint.

   The petition, initially filed with the U.S. Trade
Representative's Office last March, charged that Tokyo and
several Japanese companies conspired to block sales of
Allied's amorphous metals, alloys that Allied claims can save
70% of the electricity normally lost in conventional
transformers. Allied temporarily withdrew the petition at the
urging of U.S. trade officials to give them a chance to
negotiate a solution.
   Allied had argued that the Japanese government helped some
companies develop amorphous metals and had prevailed upon
Japanese utilities to defer purchases of such products until
the Japanese products were available and Allied's Japanese
patents had expired.
   Tokyo wouldn't agree to extend Allied's two Japanese
patents after they expire in 1993 and 1997. However, Japanese
utilities will buy 32,000 electric transformers containing
Allied's amorphous metals over the next 30 months.
   Allied estimates the potential world market for amorphous
metals at $3.5 billion a year.
