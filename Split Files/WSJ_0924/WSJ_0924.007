   WASHINGTON -- The government brought a $200 million civil
suit against Neil Bush, the president's son, and other
officials of a failed savings and loan, in an action that
will reawaken the thrift mess as a major political problem
for President Bush and the Republicans.
   The action raises the curtain on a week when attention
will focus on Neil Bush's actions as an outside director of
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association, which failed
in December 1988 at an expected cost to taxpayers of $1
billion. In a separate administrative action that regulators
are pursuing against Mr. Bush, public testimony begins
tomorrow and is expected to last through the week.

   The crisis in the Middle East has given the Republicans a
respite from growing public anger about the S&amp;L fiasco and
criticism that the Bush administration was bungling the
massive bailout.
   There's some irony in the status Neil Bush has attained as
a kind of minor folk villain -- hundreds of posters reading
"Jail Neil Bush" have been pasted around downtown Washington
and Denver, where Mr. Bush lives. (It's unclear who put the
posters up.) Mr. Bush hasn't even been accused of any
criminal activity, much less found guilty of any improper
behavior. In addition, while regulators have asserted in the
administrative case that Mr. Bush didn't adequately disclose
conflicts of interest with Silverado borrowers, no one has
suggested he profited significantly from the thrift.
   Nevertheless, the suit filed Friday in federal court in
Denver by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. adds
tremendously to Mr. Bush's legal woes. The suit goes far
beyond the administrative action in seeking to hold Mr. Bush
and 11 other former officials of the Denver thrift broadly
responsible for alleged violations of federal regulations.
The FDIC has filed more than 200 such suits against directors
in S&amp;L failures, but this is one of the largest damage awards
the agency has sought.
   "Silverado was the victim of sophisticated schemes and
abuses by insiders and of gross negligence by its directors
and outside professionals," said Douglas Jones, the FDIC's
senior deputy general counsel.
   The FDIC charged that Silverado routinely shoveled out
risky multimillion-dollar real estate loans so that the
thrift could book big fees and pass on huge salaries to some
of its officers. In 1986 alone, the suit alleged, four top
officials -- excluding Mr. Bush -- were paid $3.2 million.
   Mr. Bush has fought the administrative action brought by
the Office of Thrift Supervision, which is seeking a mild
punishment in which Mr. Bush would agree not to violate
federal regulations in the future. But it will probably be
tougher and more expensive to defend himself against the FDIC
suit, banking lawyers said, because the FDIC appears to have
a strong case.
   A key point alleged by the FDIC is that Mr. Bush and the
other outside directors failed to "correct unsafe and unsound
practices at Silverado after receiving numerous criticisms of
such practices" from regulators. Mr. Bush, who is in the oil
business, was an outside director of Silverado from August
1985 until August 1988.
   "This case will turn on what the examiners told Silverado
and when they told them," said Ronald Glancz, an attorney
with Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath and a former FDIC official who
handled such lawsuits. "In the case of directors, you've got
to show some sort of notice. It's tough to convince a jury
that directors knew some practices were imprudent if the
regulators didn't give them any warning."
   Mr. Glancz said that about 90% of defendants in the FDIC's
suits against directors and officers settle the cases. Often
the banks and thrifts have insurance to cover the liability.
But Silverado's insurance was canceled in 1986. The thrift
set up a fund of about $15 million to help directors and
officers pay legal fees, but the FDIC is engaged in a
separate legal battle to get the $15 million back.
   Neither Mr. Bush nor his attorney returned phone calls
seeking comment.
