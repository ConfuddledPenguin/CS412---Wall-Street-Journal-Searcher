   One big regional bank slashed its dividend Friday, and
another omitted its payout altogether. Both warned that they
will report third-quarter losses.
   Midlantic Corp., staggering under the burden of a heavy
exposure to New Jersey real estate, nearly halved its
dividend and said it expects to post a loss of between $150
million and $160 million for the third quarter. The bank said
it is setting aside $285 million to cover possible loan
losses in the third quarter.

   Separately, Southeast Banking Corp., Miami, omitted its
quarterly payout and said it expects a third-quarter loss of
about $87 million. Southeast also said it is negotiating to
sell its credit card portfolio, a sign the ailing bank still
is struggling to raise capital. Credit card portfolios are
among banks' most profitable businesses.
   The action by both banks came on the same day that Chase
Manhattan Corp. announced a major retrenchment. Analysts said
more banks are expected to cut their dividends in the next
few weeks as evidence grows that the economy is slowing.
   Robert Van Buren, chairman of Midlantic, a $25 billion
institution based in Edison, N.J., said the board cut the
company's quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 47
cents. As recently as the company's April 18 annual meeting,
Mr. Van Buren vowed to maintain the payout at 47 cents a
share, "barring any extraordinary developments."
   Friday, he said that "cutting the dividend helps us
conserve capital, and that's the name of the game in banking
these days."
   Mr. Van Buren said the provision for possible loan losses
resulted from a federal regulatory review of Midlantic's loan
portfolio. Since the beginning of the year, bank regulators
have been conducting so-called targeted real estate reviews
at various banks to try to identify real estate loans that
might go sour. The severe real estate downturn that started
in the Northeast has since spread to the mid-Atlantic region.
   "The regulatory examination is winding down, and this puts
us in a position in which we're {bank officials and
regulators} both in agreement that we very clearly satisfy
their concerns," he said. "That's terribly important in this
environment."
   Midlantic said it expects nonperforming assets to total
about $1.22 billion when this quarter ends, compared with
$924 million June 30.
   Analysts said that while Midlantic's exposure to real
estate will result in a loss for the year, the bank's
expenses are not out of line, as are those of many other
banks in the region. Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst at Salomon
Brothers, said the provision for losses and the dividend cut
were expected, "and in our view this is enough."
   He said Midlantic is operating in one of the U.S.'s most
difficult banking environments right now. "It's a good bank
that just happened to be caught in a downdraft," Mr. Hanley
said.
   Southeast Banking's omission of its 10-cent-a-share
quarterly dividend and announcement that its $900 million
credit card portfolio is for sale are the latest in a series
of setbacks for the beleaguered banking company. In June,
Southeast slashed its dividend to 10 cents from 28 cents a
share, announced asset sales, boosted loan-loss reserves and
said it expected to post a loss for the year. All the actions
reflected the worsening condition of the south Florida real
estate market.
   Friday, Southeast said it is adding about $115 million to
its loan-loss reserve, which will raise its total provision
for bad loans to a projected range of $300 million to $310
million by the end of this week from $278.7 million June 30.
Third-quarter charge-offs will total about $85 million.
   Southeast said it doesn't expect a third-quarter increase
in its nonperforming assets, which it reported at $619
million as of June 30. Its loss reserve as a percentage of
loans outstanding is expected to rise to about 3.15% from
2.73% as of June 30.
   In a statement, Douglas E. Ebert, president and chief
operating officer, said, "Through continuing extensive
reviews of the loan portfolio, we find that there are strong
indications under current economic conditions that the
portfolio is stabilizing." He added: "We have developed
action plans to significantly reduce credit risk assets. Each
and every business segment and expense area is under review
to maximize profitability."
   A spokesman said the sale of the credit card portfolio is
expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, but he
declined to estimate fourth-quarter results. While the
company declined to make any further predictions about
full-year results, it did say that the sale of the portfolio
would "more than offset the anticipated third-quarter loss."
