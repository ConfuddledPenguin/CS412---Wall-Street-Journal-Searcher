   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. said it reduced its
cash purchase price in its tender offer for its sole general
partner, Permian Partners Limited Partnership, to $3.5625
from $3.85 per outstanding cumulative convertible preference
unit, subject to adjustment.
   The reduction reflects the recently declared cash
distribution of 28.75 cents a preference unit for the third
quarter. The $3.5625 cash portion of the purchase price will
be subject to further reduction to reflect any distributions
as of a record date subsequent to Oct. 1 and before
completion of the offer.

   National Intergroup, an oil and drug distribution and
metals concern, also extended the tender offer from midnight
EDT tomorrow to midnight EDT Oct. 5.
   As of the close of business on Thursday, approximately 7.4
million preference units had been tendered.
   The offer is conditioned upon, among other things, the
tender of at least 7,875,001 of the publicly held preference
units representing a majority of the publicly held preference
units, the company said.
