   ATLANTA -- Researchers at Emory University say a new
treatment could lead to a cure for the symptoms of
Parkinson's disease, the muscular ailment that affects more
than 350,000 Americans.
   The research, published in the current issue of Science
magazine, involves the subthalamic nucleus, a part of the
brain that scientists previously regarded as being
unconnected to Parkinson's.

   By deactivating cells in the nucleus, however, researchers
found they could relieve the tremors and loss of muscle
control that characterize the disease.
   The study indicates this particular part of the brain "is
playing an important role in producing the signs and symptoms
of Parkinson's disease," said Mahlon DeLong, a physician and
chairman of the department of neurology at Emory. "Knowing
this, we can design better forms of treatment for the
disorder."
   The next step will be to perform additional tests on
monkeys, Dr. DeLong said, noting that surgical treatment or
medicine for humans is still "some years away."
   But he characterized the current research as encouraging.
"It gives us a better idea of where the problem is," he said.
