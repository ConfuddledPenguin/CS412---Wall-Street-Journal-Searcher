   PHILADELPHIA -- ICC Technologies Inc. isn't just blowing
hot air when it says it can help ease the nation's energy
worries.
   At least that's the hope of investors in tiny ICC, which
isn't yet profitable but is already valued at $40 million by
the stock market.

   What ICC has developed is a simple technology for reducing
the peak-load demands of such big electricity users as
supermarkets, department stores and fast-food restaurants.
   The approach involves putting a garage-sized box of
machinery on the roof that can pull humidity out of the
building and cleanse the air before sending it back inside.
ICC's product cools air in the summer, heats it in winter,
and dries it on muggy days, regardless of the season.
   Dry air is much easier to cool than moist air, so
refrigeration equipment doesn't have to work nearly as hard.
Lower humidity in a grocery store or department store also
means that customers can shop more comfortably. The nation's
30,000 supermarkets consume about 2% of the total electricity
produced in the U.S. every year. The potential for energy
savings is high.
   "Energy conservation is coming back as a policy issue,"
says Keith H. Cox, ICC's chief financial officer. "Electric
utilities used to view conservation as an anathema because it
meant lower revenues. But now, they're being rewarded for
making investments that help their customers conserve
energy."
   Among ICC's customers are J.C. Penney Co., the ShopRite
division of Village Super Market Inc., and First National
Supermarkets Inc. For example, First National, which is based
in Windsor Locks, Conn., has five of ICC's rooftop units on
line and an additional 24 on order.
   Irwin L. Gross, ICC's chairman and chief executive
officer, says he is optimistic about substantial new orders
from all three customers. In addition, ICC is working on
initial agreements with at least one fast-food chain and a
major hotel. Mr. Gross declined to identify them.
   Aided by these prospects and a growing backlog of orders,
now at $2.5 million, the company expects to turn profitable
by the end of 1991. ICC, which got its start as a maker of
co-generation units, went public in 1985. A simple unit
designed for a small restaurant costs about $55,000. Larger
and more elaborate systems may cost as much as $400,000.
   Last year, the company had a net loss of $3.6 million on
sales of about $1 million. ICC has about 5.4 million shares
outstanding, which would indicate a market capitalization of
about $40.5 million, based on Friday's close stock price of 7
1/2 bid.
   Moreover, ICC's desiccant/cogeneration units are being
welcomed by the natural gas industry. The company has
developed a cooperative advertising campaign with the
American Gas Association. In addition, many local gas and
electric utilities are offering cash rebates to eligible ICC
customers.
   The company envisions even greater involvement with
utilities as investment incentives for conservation continue
to spread. For example, Mr. Cox noted that California
regulators recently authorized about $500 million of utility
rate-base allowances over the next 28 months, designed to
spur new conservation investment.
   ICC's rooftop units, powered by natural gas, can help keep
the inside of buildings more comfortable by providing
independent temperature and humidity control. The system
doesn't require any chemicals, ozone-eroding
chlorofluorocarbons or hydrochlorofluorocarbons. What's more,
Mr. Gross says the units can cut a building's
air-conditioning costs in half and reduce its total energy
consumption by as much as 15%.
   The units dehumidify the air and cool it for recirculation
while eliminating odors and killing bacteria and fungi. On
hot days, the desiccant machines feed dry air into a
building's existing air conditioners. On cold days, the
unit's own waste heat can be used to warm up air and water,
supplementing a building's thermal needs. On rainy days, the
dessicant machines dehumidify the air.
   With less-humid air, Mr. Gross says supermarkets have been
able to save 30 kilowatts to 45 kilowatts of demand by
turning off door heaters on frozen-food cases and adjusting
refrigeration units that no longer face the problem of frost
buildup.
   Since the fourth quarter of 1989, the company has
redirected its business strategy to concentrate on desiccant
dehumidification systems. The company, which designs and
maintains its units, gains a marketing advantage by being
able to sell its products to entire retail chains instead of
having to make separate sales pitches to each store.
   Earlier this year, the company began streamlining
operations, Mr. Gross says. Reductions in general,
administrative and sales expenses have trimmed monthly
overhead by about 50%, thereby reducing the level of sales
needed to reach break-even. In addition, ICC has eliminated
about $500,000 in yearly lease payments and is expected to
cut future lease payments totaling $2.1 million over the next
six years.
   In August, ICC made a rights offering for about $3 million
of common stock to provide operating capital, expand staff
and undertake in-house production that had been subcontracted
in the research and development stages.
   Mr. Gross says the company's improved operating efficiency
and the growing backlog of business will open up new markets.
As examples, he cites nursing homes, office buildings and
hotels.
   In addition, new environmental standards have boosted the
number of times air must be exchanged in a building to avoid
"sick building syndrome." ICC believes this new requirement
will double existing air-conditioning loads. That factor
could increase the appeal of the company's machines.
   The company currently has three models, which can each be
fitted with a cogeneration plant able to produce as much as
150 kilowatts of electricity. Mr. Gross says a smaller,
lighter and more efficient prototype should be in production
by 1991.

   Investors sold over-the-counter stocks as Chase Manhattan

employees, adding to market worries about the economy and the
Mideastern conflict.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.18 to 362.25, a 0.6%
loss. Nasdaq National Market System volume climbed to 92.8
million shares from 84.8 million shares Thursday. Declining

   The deteriorating economy took its toll on a number of
technology stocks.
   Octel Communications plunged 3 to 11 3/4 on nearly 1.6
million shares and triggered selling in the stocks of other
makers of voice-processing systems and telecommunications
equipment. The slowing economy prompted analysts to cut their
earnings estimates for Octel. The Milpitas, Calif., company
also announced the resignation of chief financial officer
Robert G. Sweifach, who left to pursue other business. He was
succeeded by Gary A. Wetsel.
   Among similar stocks, Syntellect faded 3/8 to 14 1/8;

because of market conditions.
   Novell dropped 1 1/4 to 23 1/2. Gateway Communications
said it plans to discontinue original equipment manufacturer
sales of Novell's NetWare operating system, which totaled
$2.1 million in the first six months of the year. Novell is a
Provo, Utah, maker of network systems for personal computers.
   Phoenix Technologies fell 1/4 to 2 1/4. The Norwood,
Mass., maker of IBM-compatible software said it expects to
report a loss for the fourth quarter ending Sept. 30 of about
$8.5 million, after restructuring charges. A year earlier,
the company had a net loss of $11.9 million, including a $3.6
million restructuring charge.
   Midlantic Corp. rose 5/8 to 9 1/2, even though the Edison,
N.J., bank slashed its quarterly dividend to 25 cents from 47
cents a share. Midlantic also said it expects a third-quarter
loss of $150 million to $160 million as a result of a $285
million provision for possible loan losses.
