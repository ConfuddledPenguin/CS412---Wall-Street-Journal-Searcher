   Support groups are helping dieters
   And those now troubled by drink;
   And some involved in marriages
   That teeter on the brink.
   As these groups seem to multiply quickly,
   A new one's needed, no doubt,
   To support those not belonging
   And feeling sadly left out.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.

   One thing that you can certainly say
   For those miniature pagers and beepers:
   During long sermons and symphonies
   They sure rouse the adjacent sleepers]
   -- George O. Ludcke.
