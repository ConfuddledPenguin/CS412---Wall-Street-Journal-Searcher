   After four days of deliberations, a federal court jury in
Seattle returned something of a Solomonic verdict on Friday
in a case that has pitted Boeing Co. against its insurers
over $97.5 million in environmental cleanup costs.
   But by finding as it did -- that Boeing expected or
intended contamination at two King County, Wash., hazardous
waste sites only in certain years -- the panel paved the way
for continued wrangling by the two sides over how, and even
if, the expenses will be divided. Attorneys close to the case
said they ultimately expect a second jury to decide those
issues, but not until there has been another year or so of
pre-trial maneuvering.

   At the center of the Boeing case are two dumps where for
decades the aerospace concern collectively shipped about 24
million gallons of waste. Boeing used one of the sites, Queen
City Farms, from 1957 to 1968. It sent solvents, heavy metals
and acids to the other location, Western Processing, from
1964 to 1977.
   In the mid-1980s, Boeing agreed in court-ordered
settlements with the Environmental Protection Agency to clean
up the properties under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, better known as
Superfund. Boeing, in turn, sued its insurers, arguing that
they are responsible for covering the costs because the
company never expected any pollution problems. The insurers,
meanwhile, sought to show that Boeing was liable because
engineers had cautioned the company about the possibility of
contamination at the sites, but it ignored those warnings.
   The jury essentially bought both positions. It found that
Boeing "did not expect or intend" subsoil or groundwater
contamination at Queen City Farms before 1968, but starting
then it did. Similarly, the jury concluded that the company
didn't anticipate pollution problems at Western Processing
until April 1971.
   Now, Boeing is touting a total victory. It notes that the
portfolio of insurance it held during any of the years in
which the jury determined its carriers are obligated to pay
for the cleanup is big enough to cover the entire $97.5
million claim. Therefore, Boeing figures, the company is
completely off the hook.
   "Our view is that we get 100 cents on the dollar," said
Paul Carlson, Boeing's lead attorney on the case. He
maintained that U.S. District Judge William Dwyer "clearly
ruled" during a pretrial motion on the subject, and that
insurers are generally obligated "to indemnify. . . to the
maximum extent" they can.
   Moreover, he suggested that trying to figure out "what
part of the damage occurred when is a pretty tall order," and
perhaps can never really be apportioned sensibly.
   But the insurers dispute Mr. Carlson's assessment. They
argue that the jury obviously intended both sides to pay for
part of the cleanup. "Boeing is not exonerated," contended
Robert Israel, who represents underwriters for Lloyd's of
London. "The jury rejected soundly and roundly the company's
bald-faced assertion that it didn't know what it was doing"
when it was hauling waste to the two sites.
   The Lloyd's underwriters, Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity
Co. and Insurance Co. of North America, will now work
together to try and calculate how much Boeing should cough
up. Several other carriers, including American International
Group and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., are effectively out of
the case at this stage because they didn't provide Boeing
with insurance in the years singled out by the jury.
   Mr. Israel rejected the notion that Boeing's share of the
cleanup costs couldn't be fairly arrived at. He said state
courts in Washington and in other jurisdictions have come up
with such formulas, sometimes based on the volume of waste
shipped during a specific period, and other times by simply
splitting the overall dollar amount on a pro rata basis.
   He also was quick to point out that Boeing itself has sued
a number of other companies that used Western Processing in
an attempt to have them contribute to the cleanup. And in
that case, Mr. Israel said, Boeing has been able to arrive at
a system for different parties to share the expense. "To say
that we can't do the same thing means that the company is
talking out of both sides of its mouth," Mr. Israel said.
