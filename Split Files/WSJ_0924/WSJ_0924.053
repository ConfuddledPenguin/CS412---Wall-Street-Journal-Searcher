   WASHINGTON -- The public will soon have access, for the
first time, to reports showing how well U.S. financial
institutions are serving their local communities, a
development that is likely to prompt more lending to
disadvantaged groups in years ahead.
   Public access to Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA,
ratings was mandated by the 1989 thrift industry bailout
bill, but it has taken until now to get the program fully
implemented.

   The Federal Reserve expected that the first CRA report for
a bank that it examined could be made public today, Fed
Governor John LaWare said. He didn't specify the institution.
   Describing the latest developments regarding the enhanced
CRA program, Mr. LaWare said the Fed has completed 25 to 30
examinations under the new rating system set out in the law.
Slightly more than 5% of those examined received the highest
rating of outstanding, 87% were given a satisfactory rating,
and the remainder got a needs-improvement rating. No bank has
received the lowest rating, that of substantial
non-compliance. But Mr. LaWare and other officials emphasized
that the sample of banks examined is still very small.
   The CRA program has been in effect since 1977, but, with
the exception of a smattering of success stories, hasn't
attracted much public attention. Indeed, during congressional
consideration of the 1989 thrift bill, various public-policy
advocacy groups charged that the banks and their examiners
were largely ignoring the 1977 reinvestment requirements, in
effect hiding behind the confidential nature of the rating
exercise. In response, Congress mandated the new system of
public disclosure.
   Mr. LaWare disputed the notion that the program wasn't
working well previously, though he conceded that the new
approach is likely to produce better results.
   Publication of the ratings and the bank examiners' CRA
report will probably be a "double jolt" to the program, the
Fed governor said. First, banks will be more diligent about
complying, and second, examiners will be more focused on the
issue, as a result of extensive training programs carried out
in recent months.
   Community Reinvestment Act ratings are important to banks
because, by law, they must be taken into consideration by
regulatory agencies when considering bank applications to
expand, for example, by acquiring another institution.
   Safety and soundness issues and competitiveness factors
are the major determinants for approvals in such cases, but
it is possible that an otherwise qualified application would
be turned down because of a poor CRA rating, Mr. LaWare said.
   The new system of making CRA reports public has "created a
great deal of anxiety on the part of bankers," he said. Among
other things, banks are worried that the public may confuse
CRA ratings with the banks' degree of financial soundness, he
said, noting that the two have nothing to do with each other.
It is conceivable that a bank with a high soundness rating
could have a poor CRA rating, or vice versa, Fed officials
said.
   They also said that enhanced CRA lending activities
shouldn't serve to undermine the financial condition of
banks, even though such loans are aimed at disadvantaged
borrowers.
   "This is not intended to be a give-away program," Mr.
LaWare said, noting that nothing in the law says that banks
have to make bad loans. Innovative approaches and credit
enhancement techniques can result in sound credits, he said.
   The CRA program is aimed at forcing banks and their
directors to explore aggressively the credit needs of less
advantaged elements of the communities they serve, and to
seek out lending opportunities, as opposed to waiting for
business to walk in the door, he said.
   What is beginning to emerge, he asserted, is a notion of
"enlightened self interest," where banks come to realize that
such activities are in their own best interest. "I believe
the concept is being recognized and accepted widely by the
banking community," he said.
   But if this isn't the case on a voluntary basis, the new
supervision and public exposure program is likely to push
banks in that direction. "If the cops are out, people are
going to obey the speed limit," Mr. LaWare said.
   He also said that he anticipates CRA-related lending will
become increasingly visible, and that such activities by
banks will produce a notable effect in terms of development
that wasn't occurring previously.
