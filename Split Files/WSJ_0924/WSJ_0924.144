   NEW YORK -- One shot might not ignite a war in the
Mideast, but it would cripple the yen and most European
currencies through higher crude oil prices, analysts say.
Without a war, however, the dollar is likely to weaken.
   A survey of oil analysts and economists suggests the
dollar would gain about 20 yen within minutes of the first
volley of gunfire in the Gulf as traders and investors scurry
to a "haven." The British pound also would gain during an
armed conflict, while other European currencies would suffer,
they say.

   If the stalemate with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
continues, many analysts say crude oil prices will stay well
above $30 a barrel, but the dollar will continue to suffer
because of the weak U.S. economy. That weakness also will
take its toll on the dollar if the Gulf crisis is resolved
peacefully.
   "The one thing that would be positive for the dollar, in a
perverse sense, is if there was a war," said Bob Chandross,
vice president and chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New
York.
   Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 136.65
yen, falling a full yen from 137.65 yen late Thursday in New
York.
   But the U.S. currency edged up against the mark Friday,
being quoted in late New York trading at 1.5785 marks, up
from 1.5773 marks late Thursday. Sterling was trading at
$1.8435, down from $1.8740.
   Financial markets were closed in Tokyo Monday for a public
holiday.
   The benchmark U.S. oil futures product, the November light
sweet crude oil contract, closed at $35.43 a barrel Friday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, up $2.01 from Thursday,
when the October contract went off the board near a record
high of $35. If the Mideast erupts, experts say, the
soonest-expiring contract's price likely would fly well above
$40 a barrel, pulling the dollar and sterling along.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, crude oil futures
prices have risen about $13.50 a barrel.
   The World Bank Thursday warned that a "war scenario" in
the Middle East would push oil prices "to as high as $65 {a
barrel} in the short term," eventually translating into
higher world interest rates and slower growth for industrial
countries as well as a large group of Third World nations.
   Among major currencies, the yen is the most vulnerable to
a sharp rise in oil prices, because Japan is totally
dependent on foreign oil. If a shooting war causes a
substantial disruption in supplies, the yen could slide to
165 yen to the dollar, according to Peter Cardillo, director
of commodities research at Jessup Josephtal &amp; Co. The mark,
reflecting Germany's relative dependence on foreign oil,
would also wilt to around 1.72 to the dollar, he predicted.
   Kiyohiko Yoshizawa, a corporate foreign-exchange trader at
Midland Bank in New York, said he would prefer sterling to
the dollar as a haven in a crisis. "If it's a war between the
Arabs and Israel, there's a greater possibility the Arabs
would attack Israel's ally, the U.S.," he reasoned. Moreover,
the fundamental weakness of the U.S. economy puts downward
pressure on the dollar, he said.
   Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist
at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, is banking on a war. "The
sooner the better, before Americans' patience runs out," he
said.
   His reasoning, shared by some others, is that the only
thing that really will help the dollar is a disruption in oil
supplies. Without such a disruption, the Germans and Japanese
would prove more efficient consumers of their oil than the
U.S., he said.
   The Norwest economist cited statistics from the
International Energy Agency that show U.S. fossil-fuel
consumption at 2.25% of gross national product, compared with
1.21% for Japan and 1.32% for Germany. (Coal, petroleum and
natural gas are all fossil fuels.)
   "There's a lot of baggage the dollar is carrying," said
Mr. Sohn, listing the heightened possibility of a U.S.
recession, lower interest rates, the federal budget deficit
and the costly savings-and-loan bailout.
   Gilbert Benz, economist with Swiss Bank Corp. in New York,
said he considers the current situation "an oil shock" but
agrees it isn't likely to help the dollar unless the shooting
starts. "The economic fundamentals in the U.S. remain weak,"
he said.
   Barring an armed conflict, Mr. Benz sees only a 25% chance
oil prices will rise above $40 a barrel this year.
   Mr. Benz called the current crisis "modest" compared with
those that followed the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 and the
1979 beginning of the Iranian revolution. The average price
for imported crude oil went from about $3 a barrel to $4.08
in 1973 and to $12.52 in 1974, according to the American
Petroleum Institute in Washington. In May 1979, Saudi crude
fetched $40 a barrel.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $389.40 an ounce Friday, up 30 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$388.50 an ounce.
