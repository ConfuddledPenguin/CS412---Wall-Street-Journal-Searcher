   Salant Corp., an apparel maker operating under protection
of the bankruptcy laws, reported its fiscal second-quarter
net loss widened to $33.3 million from nearly $9 million a
year earlier.
   On a per-share basis, Salant's loss for the second period,
ended June 26, amounted to $9.64 compared with $2.62. Sales,
which were hurt by weakness at the retail level, fell 31% to
$77.4 million from $101.4 million. Sales also were
interrupted in the two weeks before Salant filed its
bankruptcy-law petition, the company said.

   For July, the New York company posted nearly $2.4 million
in profit on $43.2 million of sales. The profit reflected
factors including the elimination of interest expense on
Salant's debt; the company neither accrues nor pays such
interest while it operates under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code.
   Salant also estimated that in August it earned more than
July's profit on some $54 million of sales.
