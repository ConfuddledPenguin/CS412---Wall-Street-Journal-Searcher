   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, which is trying to
get its allies to tighten restrictions on the shipment of
missile-related technology to potentially unstable regions,
is still struggling to find workable controls of its own.
   The conflict became evident during a hearing of the
congressional Joint Economic Committee about the
administration's handling of two controversial export-license
applications.

   U.S. policy "is in disarray," said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D.,
N.M.). He complained that the policy currently is set by a
"hodgepodge" of agencies.
   In one case discussed during the hearing, the U.S. first
authorized Brazil to obtain special heat treatment for seven
rocket casings, but then reversed itself and prohibited
similar treatment for 11 other casings. Heat treatment is a
process of hardening rocket parts to make them more resistant
to the stresses of re-entry into the atmosphere.
   The State Department initially gave the state-managed
Brazilian Aeronautical Commission a license to obtain the
heat-treatment services because it saw no risk that the parts
would be transferred to a potential war zone. But the
administration altered its position after the Pentagon
complained. The Pentagon, which didn't participate in the
original decision, argued that the treatment could give
Brazil the capability to build vertical-launch rockets with
potential military applications.
   The Chicago firm that provided the treatment, Lindberg
Corp., earlier said in a statement that it had been assured
by the Brazilian licensee that the casings would be used only
for space research and wouldn't be resold to any other party.
   In another case, the administration indicated that it is
preparing to act on a long-delayed application by
International Business Machines Corp. to enhance the power of
an IBM 3090 Model 200 computer installed at Embraer, a
Brazilian aeronautical firm. There has been considerable
debate over whether the technology could be used in missile
development programs.
   A senior administration official said the sale could be
approved if Brazil guarantees the technology won't be
diverted to unauthorized uses.
   But Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control, warned the congressional panel that the
IBM sale poses a risk of diversion because of the presence in
Brazilian aeronautical circles of "high-tech mercenaries" who
could share supercomputing knowledge with Iraq.
   IBM said its proposed sale of two additional
data-processing units for the computer would be accompanied
by an airtight "government-to-government agreement" on
securing the beefed-up machine.
   International concern about missile proliferation has been
intensified by the faceoff between Iraq and the U.S. and its
allies in the Persian Gulf. Despite Washington's own
agonizing experience with such licenses, it is urging its
allies to retain or tighten their own controls on the export
of missile and chemical-warfare technology, even if there no
longer are restrictions on shipment of the technology to the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. James LeMunyon, deputy
assistant secretary of commerce for export administration,
said the appeal will be cabled to 16 allied governments soon.
   In 1987, the U.S. and some of its allies organized an
informal arrangement called the Missile Technology Control
Regime, but the venture is handicapped by the lack of a
specific, up-to-date list of controlled items. Moreover, the
group, which includes West Germany, Canada, France, Italy,
Britain and Japan, has no ability to control exports from
newly industrializing countries like Taiwan and South Korea.
   A U.S. proposal could affect shipments to as many as 36
countries believed to be developing missile-manufacturing
skills. U.S. officials cautioned, however, that it won't be
easy to secure agreement on which products to control and
which destinations to proscribe. "Some of these countries are
our friends," said Henry Sokolski, a Pentagon aide in charge
of non-proliferation policy.
   A State Department official said the U.S. will try to
prevail upon Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello to
respect U.S. non-proliferation concerns. Mr. Collor is
scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly
today.
