   NEW YORK -- The real estate industry is locked in a
serious recession. The optimists think that business will
bottom out in the next year or so and that the industry then
will start moving upward. Many analysts, however, believe
real estate will be scraping along the bottom at least
through the mid-1990s.
   The optimists note that lenders and developers had plenty
of trouble in the 1970s. At some banks in the Southeast, for
example, bad assets peaked at 14% of loans in 1976. That's
about the same level as at today's most imperiled banks, such
as Bank of New England. Yet few lenders failed in the 1970s,
and the real estate industry rather quickly recovered.

   Yet, according to James W. Warren, senior executive vice
president of First Florida Bank, Tampa, "Those who think the
industry will do as well as it did in the mid-1970s are dead
wrong."
                                                                                                       

   The recession is spotty, to be sure. While the Northeast
is firmly in its grip, Texas, which sank into a real estate
slump ahead of most areas, now seems to be recovering. Some
areas in the Midwest, benefiting from a rebound in
manufacturing, look reasonably healthy, as do parts of the
Pacific Northwest.
                                                                                                       

   But the recession's impact clearly is national. Housing
starts in the past few months have sunk to the lowest levels
since the 1981-82 recession, and office and apartment
vacancies have been high. "Absorption of office space is at
an all-time low," says Raymond Torto of Coldwell Banker/Torto
Wheaton Services Inc., a firm that keeps track of vacancies.
   Demography plays a role in the residential slowdown. The
post-World War II baby boom ended about 1960, so the number
of families in their late 20s -- the peak home-buying years
-- is rising more slowly. In the 1970s, by contrast,
developers and lenders were still benefiting from a strong
and growing demand for space.
   Industry officials didn't see the demographic slowdown
coming or, if they saw it, chose to believe it wouldn't apply
to them. "Developers make money only when they build," one
analyst comments, "and consequently they will build as long
as funds are available."
   In the 1970s, lots of funds were available. Savings and
loan associations traditionally had borrowed short-term funds
from depositors and lent them on long-term home mortgages at
fixed rates. In an effort to help the S&amp;Ls, Congress
broadened their lending powers, notably by allowing them to
lend on commercial real estate.
                                                                                                       

   The S&amp;Ls ran into stiff competition from commercial banks,
which had been losing much of their commercial and industrial
loan business to securities firms. Outstanding C&amp;I loans of
the 15 largest banks declined last year to about $175 billion
from $200 billion in 1982.
                                                                                                       

   The result of the competition for loans has been
overbuilding. Although construction activity has slowed
sharply, it will take time for the market to absorb the home
and office space that has already been built. One banker who
prefers not to be identified says, "In five years we've built
a 15-year supply of space, and we're going to spend the next
10 years trying to fill it."
   At the moment, there aren't a lot of lenders standing
around waiting to finance sales and leases of all this
surplus space. Federal regulators have come down hard on the
banks, and Congress has sharply curtailed the thrifts'
activity. As a result, lenders are examining potential loans
much more carefully than they were earlier in the decade.
"Lenders are treating developers like they've got some kind
of leprosy," says Scott Toombs, a New Jersey developer.
"Things are exceedingly difficult."
   The situation isn't likely to get easier very quickly. The
economy already is teetering on the brink of a general
recession, and the real estate slump could help to bring it
on. This, of course, could only make the real estate problems
worse.
   One factor the real estate industry had going for it
through much of the 1970s was a generally expansionary
Federal Reserve policy. Inflation rates zoomed into double
digits both in the mid-1970s and in the latter part of the
decade. Investors were interested in real estate as a hedge
against rising prices, and real estate values soared. Some
real estate loans, viewed as bad investments, came to look
very good.
                                                                                                       

   Analysts see little chance that the industry will get
another inflationary bailout anytime soon. The Federal
Reserve has been following a very cautious and generally
restrictive policy despite strong pressure from the Bush
administration to ease up to try to prevent a recession. For
the present, at least, the Fed appears to view inflation as a
more serious worry than recession.
                                                                                                       

   Real estate has always had its ups and downs. In the down
periods, developers usually move into home repair or some
other line of work. Some lenders are beginning to wonder
whether they shouldn't work out survival tactics -- or at
least learn to avoid the excesses they have been guilty of in
recent years. James McCormick, president of FMCG Capital
Strategies, a consulting firm, calls real estate the
"narcotic" of commercial lending, because bankers so often
get hooked on the fat loan margins and fees. In the 1980s,
some lenders relaxed their credit standards, often lending
against developers' personal net worth, which vanished as
real estate values fell.
   It has happened before. "The New England problems wouldn't
have happened," Florida's Mr. Warren says, "if bankers had
learned from what happened earlier in Arizona, and the
Arizona troubles wouldn't have happened if bankers had
learned from Texas. As a group," he concludes sadly, "we
bankers don't learn very well from past experience."
