   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration's long-awaited plan
for preserving the northern spotted owl pleased neither the
timber industry nor environmentalists, and left some of the
thorniest issues for Congress to resolve.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan said the administration is asking
Congress to allow new sales of 3.3 billion board feet of
timber on Forest Service lands in Washington, Oregon and
Northern California during the fiscal year that begins Oct.
1. Industry officials expressed disappointment that the
proposed level wasn't higher, while environmentalists
characterized it as excessive logging that would jeopardize
the long-term survival of the owl's ecosystem.

   "It's less overcutting, but it's still significant
overcutting," said Frances Hunt, forestry resources
specialist for the National Wildlife Federation. "They're
cutting those forests at an unsustainable rate and that puts
everything at risk."
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, chided the administration for
advancing only a one-year plan and "putting off the tough
decisions until later."
   In June, the administration declared the owl threatened
and put it under the protection of the Endangered Species
Act. At the time, the administration delayed announcing the
bulk of its forest-management steps, saying it would wait for
the recommendations of a task force headed by Mr. Yeutter.
The latest steps are based on those recommendations.
   But the administration didn't spell out in any detail how
3.3 billion board feet of lumber can be cut without
jeopardizing the spotted owl's well-being. The administration
also didn't present a plan for future years.
   The administration is seeking to give a greater role in
the spotted owl dispute to the endangered species committee,
or so-called God Squad. The cabinet-level panel can overrule
Agriculture and Interior Department decisions prohibiting
economic activity that would jeopardize an endangered
species, but it is rarely convened.
   Under the administration's proposals, Congress would
authorize a convening of the committee with authority to
review all timber sales and land management plans related to
the spotted owl. Environmentalists blasted this idea, and key
lawmakers have suggested that Congress is unlikely to accept
it.
   The administration also is asking Congress to adopt
language that "requires implementation" of its
forest-management plans, which have been the subject of
considerable litigation by environmentalists in the past.
Officials said they don't recommend "precluding judicial
review," though they didn't suggest any other way to ensure
that timber sales aren't blocked.
   Labor and timber interests complained that reducing
Washington and Oregon timber harvests, which will total 4.5
billion in the year ending Sunday, would have serious
economic effects. The labor and timber interests were equally
unhappy about the proposal to allow only 310 million board
feet in Northern California, about half of the average cut
planned for national forests there.
   The plan "represents a formula for economic depression,
personal hardship and social turmoil throughout the Pacific
Northwest," asserted Michael Draper, spokesman for the
Western Council of Industrial Workers, which represents
23,000 timber-industry employes.
   But the industry expressed hope that Congress would
authorize, as recommended, an immediate convening of the
endangered species committee. The endangered species law
requires the committee to hold hearings; saw-mill towns and
timber families see the hearings as an opportunity to have
"their voices heard for the first time." Said Mark Rey,
executive director of the American Forest Resource Alliance:
"This deadly serious game over the fate of the Pacific
Northwest economy has just begun."
   Secretary Lujan said he would appoint a team to develop a
long-term recovery plan for the owl as required by the
endangered species act. This will include continuing the
Yeutter task force and giving it the broader mission of
reviewing the nation's forest-management needs.
