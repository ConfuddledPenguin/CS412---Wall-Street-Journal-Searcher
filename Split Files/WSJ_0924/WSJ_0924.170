   LONDON -- The launch this week of Nissan Motor Co.'s
Primera marks the start of the Japanese auto giant's European
style offensive.
   With the Primera, a family car designed and engineered for
Europe predominantly by Europeans, Nissan aims to double its
European market share to about 5% by the mid-1990s.

   The Primera-led push, said Ian Gibson, managing director
of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (U.K.) Ltd., is all about
"selling image and brand."
   Previously, Nissan suffered from a dull and boring image,
say analysts, largely because of the boxy styling of the
Bluebird model previously produced at its Sunderland,
England, plant. The Primera is rounded in design, matching
more closely the style of its European competitors, and
places an added emphasis on performance.
   Mr. Gibson says Nissan aims to price the car
competitively. The new Nissan also boasts some special
features, like a multilink suspension system and the most
advanced engine available in its sector, all of which places
it a "step ahead of rivals," he said.
   John Lawson, of Nomura Research Institute, said the
Primera is more than just a change from one model series to
the next. "It's a step change in quality and positioning of a
car in the market place," he said.
   Nissan hopes its new image will be firmly in place by
1992, when it plans to launch a new model to replace its
Micra at the small end of the car market. The model again
will be a European design for Europeans, different from the
current Micra, although it might adopt the same name, a
company spokesman says.
   Nissan decided to produce the Primera before the new small
model because its European distribution network is more
geared to the upper end of the family car market.
   Additionally, says Mr. Gibson, the company felt the larger
family car could make a more distinct impact on what is
traditionally a trendier end of the market. Cars at the upper
end can adopt a wider range of specifications and features so
there is more chance that one will stand out against another.
   The Primera will run up against Ford Motor Co.'s Sierra,
General Motors Corp.'s Vectra/Cavalier and Peugeot S.A.'s
405.
   Nissan became the first Japanese car maker to assemble
cars in Europe when production started in 1986 at the
Sunderland plant. By 1992, Nissan will have spent #640
million ($1.206 billion) developing the site, the company
said.
   The U.K. production facility will be producing 100,000
units each of the Primera and Micra by 1993, half of which
will be exported to European markets, according to Nissan
plans. Nissan proposes to produce 100,000 Primeras by next
year, about one-third more than the Bluebird production but
less than a third the number of Sierras, Vectras/Cavaliers or
Peugeot 405s made in Europe.
   But more than available volume, image has been a main
stumbling block for Nissan sales in Europe, hindering its
penetration of markets, analysts said. The Primera is the
first serious European challenger from the Nissan camp, they
said.
   Nissan's Mr. Gibson acknowledged the Bluebird didn't make
a great impact on the fleet-sales market but argued that it
was successful in the private sale market.
   Nevertheless, burdened with Nissan's dull image, the
Primera is "unlikely to jump in as a best seller," said Nick
Ireland, of Robert Fleming &amp; Co. Ltd. "Improving your image
is a slow process. You have got to reckon it will be a slow
starter. Word of mouth will be the main selling factor for
the car."
   Where Nissan aims to attack rivals with the Primera is on
key issues of performance, including a new multilink
front-wheel-drive suspension system, Mr. Gibson said. Placing
the system on a front-wheel-drive car is a "world first," Mr.
Gibson said, and offers the sort of handling normally
associated with a sports car or a car further up the price
range.
   Mr. Gibson noted the car is competitively priced, Nissan
having keenly considered prices of rival vehicles in coming
to its own pricing decision. The basic price range of the
Primera is #8,023 to #13,643 pounds, comparable to the
Sierra, Peugeot 405 and Vectra, though slightly higher than
the Bluebird.
   But Mr. Gibson said he hopes the strong European element
in the car will be a selling point. The car has been designed
to a European concept and many of its technical features are
typically European, rather than Japanese, he said.
   The only part of the Primera to be imported from Japan is
the transmission, the company said. Nissan is buying
components for the car from 177 European suppliers, 120 of
which are British.
   Analysts say the home-grown approach could help sway
Britain's important fleet buyers, many of whom are strictly
patriotic. Knowing that a major part of the vehicle is made
in the U.K. and to European tastes could help sell the
Primera to the lucrative company car market.
   With the Bluebird, 10% to 20% of the U.K. plant's 77,000
unit-a-year production was sold to the fleet market, with the
rest going to the retail sector. Mr. Gibson said the company
hopes to double its U.K. fleet sales while maintaining its
position in the private retail sales market.
   Mr. Gibson said he hopes to break the mold of the West
German market, which is dominated by a consumer desire for a
homemade products that handle well on that country's
high-speed roads. He said he sees the European-conceived
model as attracting customers traditionally geared toward
Audi AG, Volkswagen AG, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) and
Daimler-Benz AG.
   Together with imports from facilities outside Europe,
Nissan sales take slightly less than 3% of the European
market, with its biggest markets in Britain and West Germany,
Mr. Gibson said.
