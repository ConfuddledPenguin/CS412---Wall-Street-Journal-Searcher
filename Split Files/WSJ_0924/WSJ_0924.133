   NEW YORK -- Philadelphia is facing its worst cash crunch
ever, and many analysts believe the city could eventually
default on some of its bond payments.
   Yet the bonds of the nation's fifth-largest city aren't
getting massacred in the market; instead, they are getting
recommended by analysts. What's going on?

   It seems that investors, after going through similar
crises in the 1970s with New York and Cleveland, have learned
an important lesson: Big cities usually make good on their
debt obligations.
   Philadelphia bonds have been under pressure ever since
officials of the city acknowledged that it is running out of
cash. Last Friday, Mayor W. Wilson Goode said Philadelphia
will go broke by Dec. 1, even with cost-saving measures,
unless it can borrow from banks or the credit markets. To
avert running out of cash on Nov. 9, the mayor said the city
will defer $90 million in pension fund contributions, freeze
hiring, and seek a structured settlement to stretch out
repayment of $25 million in realty transfer taxes that a
state court said were illegally levied; after these moves,
the city still won't be able to meet payrolls in the first
week of December, Mr. Goode said. He added that an aide to
Gov. Robert P. Casey assured him that the governor won't let
the city become insolvent.
   Two weeks ago, the city was shut out of the market when it
tried to sell $375 million in short-term notes that would
have been used to offset a $206.4 million budget deficit. Mr.
Goode said he is considering another attempt to sell the
notes in a few weeks.
   Late last week, 8 1/4% tax-exempt general-obligation bonds
of Philadelphia were quoted at more than 92 cents on the
dollar, to yield 9.1%. Though this yield was up from 7 3/4% a
few weeks ago, analysts say, Philadelphia bond prices haven't
fallen as much as could be expected, considering that the
credit rating on the bonds has been slashed to the level of
medium-grade junk bonds-triple-C by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
and single-B by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Fitch
Investors Service Inc.
   "We're seeing substantial demand" for Philadelphia bonds,
says Larry Morris, a municipal bond trader at Butcher &amp;
Singer. "People feel that at these yield levels, it's worth
taking the risk. Some investors believe there is a lot of
money to be made, just like there was when New York had
problems."
   On a taxable-equivalent basis, the current yields on
Philadelphia general-obligation bonds are about 11.9% for
investors in the 28% federal income-tax bracket and 13.8% for
investors in the 33% bracket.
   The higher the yield rises, the more often securities
analysts recommend that investors seeking speculative
opportunities consider buying Philadelphia bonds.
   Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president at the bond
dealer Gabriele, Hueglin &amp; Cashman Inc., says that yields on
Philadelphia general-obligation bonds could rise further in
the months ahead, especially if the city misses any interest
payments. Nevertheless, he advises clients to consider buying
the bonds now. "I think the bonds will bounce back," Mr.
Hueglin says. "It's a nice speculative investment, because
G.O.s are made good on with more reliability than other kinds
of issues."
   Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond Investors
Association, a nonprofit group that tracks corporate and
municipal bond defaults, has been advising Philadelphia
bondholders to sit tight and hold on to their bonds.
   "I don't see this as a dangerous situation. It's more
political than financial," he says. "Even if there is a
default, the problem will probably get resolved."
   If it seems that Messrs. Hueglin and Lehmann are taking a
rather casual approach toward a disturbing situation, it is
because they have been there before.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Stalled deficit-reduction talks and news of a move in
Congress to delay the automatic budget cuts mandated under
the Gramm-Rudman law sent bond prices sharply lower.
   "The market is expecting $50 billion to be cut from the
budget this year," and any indication that the federal budget
deficit-reduction targets might not be met is greeted
negatively, said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria
Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
   She said budget concerns seemed to override all other
factors operating in the fixed-income markets, including
another jump in crude oil prices and reports of rising
tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   Even flight-to-quality buying on the short end of the
yield curve, following news that Chase Manhattan Corp. is
increasing loan provisions and laying off employees, couldn't
stem the downturn in bond prices.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly one
point, or $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, while the
yield jumped to 9.12%. Two-year notes posted modest declines
of nearly 1/8 point, to yield 8.1%. In when-issued trading,
yields on two-year notes scheduled to be sold tomorrow were
quoted at 8.1%, and yields on four-year notes scheduled to be
sold Wednesday were quoted at 8.48%.
   Meanwhile, prices of most long-term investment-grade
corporate bonds ended about 7/8 point lower. But prices of
bonds issued by Chase Manhattan plunged after the nation's
third-largest banking concern stunned investors with a
barrage of news. The bank said it will slash its staff by
5,000, and take a $650 million provision for loan losses and
a $350 million restructuring charge in the third quarter.
   Chase Manhattan's 10% subordinated notes, due in 1999,
which were yielding 14% before the latest disclosure, shot up
to 14.75%. The price fell six points, about $60 for a bond
with a $1,000 face amount, to 77.
