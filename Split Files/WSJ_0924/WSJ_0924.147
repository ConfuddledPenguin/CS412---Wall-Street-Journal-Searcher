   Boston Edison Co. said the U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston
reversed a $39.3 million antitrust judgment against the
company.
   The company last year was ordered to pay the damages to
the towns of Concord and Wellesley, Mass., after a jury found
that wholesale rates the utility charged the towns violated
antitrust laws. The towns alleged price discrimination,
anticompetitive restrictions and price squeezing.

   The appeals court, however, noting that the towns could
have purchased power from other suppliers, said the towns
failed to prove that Boston Edison had a monopoly.
   Boston Edison said that the 1989 judgment hadn't been
reflected in the company's financial statements, and thus the
appeals court decision won't affect the company's earnings.
