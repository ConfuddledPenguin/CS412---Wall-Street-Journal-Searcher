   Ciments Francais S.A. said consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests rose 7% in the first half,
despite a marked slowdown in activity in North America.
   The Paris cement group said profit was 402 million French
francs ($76.2 million) in the first half, up from 377 million
francs a year earlier.

   Ciments Francais previously said consolidated revenue
gained 30% to 7.29 billion francs from 5.63 billion francs,
buoyed by strong gains from southern European activities.
   Consolidated operating profit was up 27% to 1.18 billion
francs from 928 million francs.
   The company said that full-year net profit should rise
from 1989's 1.1 billion francs on revenue of 12.5 billion
francs, but didn't elaborate.
   In the latest half, 57% of sales were in France. Cement
products accounted for 49% of overall sales, while 51% came
from construction materials.
