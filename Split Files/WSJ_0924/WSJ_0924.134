   UCB S.A. should be able to produce a 1991 profit before
exceptional items that is at least as high as this year's
earnings, even with the recent surge in oil prices, the
chairman of the Brussels chemical and pharmaceutical
company's executive committee said.
   "We are clearly less vulnerable than other chemical
companies," Georges Jacobs said in an interview. Higher oil
prices shouldn't have much effect on UCB's specialty
chemicals and pharmaceuticals, he said.

   The oil surge will raise raw-material costs for UCB units
producing special polypropylene films used in food packaging,
but the effect will be minor in terms of the entire company's
results, he said. UCB's production of cellulose film, also
used to wrap food, is partially shielded from higher oil
costs because the company has converted its plants to burn
coal, Mr. Jacobs said.
   For the first half of 1990, UCB reported group net profit
of 1.31 billion Belgian francs ($41 million), up 31% from 1
billion francs ($31 million) a year earlier. For the full
year, UCB has projected its profit before exceptional items
will equal or moderately exceed 1989's earnings of 2.26
billion francs.
