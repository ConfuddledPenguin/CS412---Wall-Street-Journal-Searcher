   NEW YORK -- The news divisions of the three major networks
are undertaking some ambitious new programming initiatives in
an effort to bolster declining viewership and extend their
franchises.
   At CBS News, battered by layoffs and stagnant second-place
ratings for the "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather," two new
prime-time series are quietly under development. Rival ABC
News today is expected to announce plans for a new, five-hour
overnight broadcast starting in January. NBC, meanwhile, is
considering bringing back the one-hour summer NBC News series
"Real Life with Jane Pauley" as a weekly half-hour program.

   Although the networks have yet to draw impressive ratings
with any of their primetime news shows, they continue to try
new ones because of the relatively low cost. The networks own
the news shows and don't have to buy the product from a
Hollywood studio; also, a one-hour news program costs about
$500,000, half of what it costs to produce an entertainment
show.
   Some of the proposed new programming appears to draw
heavily on concepts already tried by more
entertainment-oriented syndication companies. At CBS News, a
unit of CBS Inc., one program under development has the
working title "On Trial" and could be a half-hour series. CBS
News hasn't produced a half-hour show since "On The Road with
Charles Kuralt" and "Our Times with Bill Moyers" aired as
summer series in 1983.
   Each "On Trial" show would focus on one trial and include
interviews with the participants. CBS News recently taped two
trials, one in Los Angeles that sought to determine whether a
man convicted of murder was insane at the time of the crime,
and another about a Johnston, Iowa, couple accused of child
endangerment after their 11-year-old son died from a bowel
obstruction. The trials will be used in a future "48 Hours"
show, a current CBS News series, but they could serve as the
basis for "On Trial" pilots.
   The other program, also being developed as a half-hour
series, is tentatively titled "Whose Side Are You On?" It
would present the pros and cons of a controversial issue,
such as the so-called suicide machine developed by a Michigan
pathologist and used by an Oregon woman with Alzheimer's
disease earlier this year.
   Andrew Heyward, executive producer of "48 Hours," is
developing both programs. According to individuals within CBS
News, Mr. Heyward told the "48 Hours" staff recently that
Jeff Sagansky, CBS's senior prime-time programmer, is
receptive to new CBS News projects. Asked about the two
proposed series, Mr. Heyward said, "This is a favorable time
for developing informational programming. We at `48 Hours'
are happy to fill the gap."
   But the two CBS series would be joining a crowded field.
Last year, Republic Pictures Corp.'s domestic television
distribution unit syndicated a show, also titled "On Trial,"
but it failed after one season, because many real trials are
"boring, dull, harsh, cruel and not always perfect," Republic
President Charles Larson said previously. And early next
year, American Lawyer Media L.P. is planning to launch a
cable channel, called the American Courtroom Network, that
would broadcast trials peppered with commentary.
   CBS News already produces two primetime series, "60
Minutes" and "48 Hours," and is scheduled to produce
occasional specials of "Face to Face with Connie Chung." As
previously reported, the division, which has an annual
operating budget of $340 million and is profitable, is also
considering launching a half-hour show at 11:30 p.m. with
correspondents Charles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl.
   At NBC, meanwhile, the Jane Pauley series was
well-received when it aired last summer and was NBC's most
successful new news series ever. It could come back as a
midseason replacement for a show that doesn't work, possibly
paired with "Expose," an investigative journalism series with
correspondent Brian Ross and producer Ira Silverman. A
spokeswoman for NBC News, a unit of General Electric Co.,
confirmed that discussions are taking place, but emphasized
that "nothing final has been decided."
   ABC's overnight broadcast has been under consideration for
several months, and ABC News officials said many of the
network's 200-plus affiliates requested the service. The
broadcast would air from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. and originate from
Washington, D.C. The ABC newscast will be starkly different
from "Nightwatch," CBS News's overnight show, because it will
have up-to-the-minute news reports. "Nightwatch," a two-hour
show that CBS premiered in October 1982, is pretaped and
broadcast at 2 a.m. and rerun at 4 a.m. and emphasizes
interviews. CBS News is likely to revamp "Nightwatch," which
has been without a permanent anchor for several months, but
there are no firm plans.
   Currently, the ABC affiliates air syndicated shows or
movies, which the stations must pay for. ABC News, a unit of
Capital Cites/ABC Inc., declined to comment, pending today's
announcement.
   At ABC, the overnight newscast is the first time the
network has attempted a late-night news program since 1982,
when it temporarily expanded "Nightline" to one hour and
followed it with "The Last Word," a 60-minute talk show with
Greg Jackson and Phil Donahue.
