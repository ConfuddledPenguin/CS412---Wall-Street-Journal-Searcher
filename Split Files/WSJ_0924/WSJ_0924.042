   NORWOOD, Mass. -- Analog Devices Inc. said it will take a
pretax charge of about $12 million against its
venture-capital portfolio that, with a previously announced
charge, will result in losses for the fiscal fourth quarter
and year ending Nov. 2.
   Ray Stata, president and chairman, said the "soft market
and economic climate for early-stage, high-technology
companies" prompted the company to take a charge against its
venture portfolio. The value of the portfolio is about $13
million.

   Mr. Stata said "volatile performance" of companies in the
portfolio has produced a "random and unpredictable" effect on
Analog's earnings. A spokesman added that Analog probably
won't make future venture-capital investments because "it has
been a tougher deal than we anticipated."
   The charge will be in addition to a previously announced
pretax charge of $12 million to $15 million that the company
expects to take as a result of "planned restructuring and
inventory adjustments" following its acquisition of Precision
Monolithics.
   Joseph Hinchey, senior vice president, finance, said the
company remains in "very strong financial condition" with
healthy cash flow and debt at 8% of equity.
   Analog, which makes integrated circuits and other
electronic parts, had net income of $469,000, or one cent a
share, on sales of $110.9 million in the fiscal fourth
quarter ended Oct. 28, 1989. For all of fiscal 1989, it had
net of $27.9 million, or 58 cents a share, on sales of $453.4
million.
