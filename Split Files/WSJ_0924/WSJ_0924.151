   Has Wall Street lost the war?
   Now that the Federal Reserve Board has let commercial
banks underwrite stocks, the securities industry is left with
little or no leverage as it tries to keep banks from having
absolute reign on its turf.

   Even before last week's Fed move, Wall Street had seen the
writing on the wall and dropped its outright opposition to
letting banks into the securities business. Now, however, the
securities industry is left with only the hope of forging a
compromise with the banks through Congress, or forcing change
through the courts. Either avenue will be tough going.
   And as the banks win more and more power from the Fed, the
securities industry has little to do but howl its
indignation.
   "This is a regulator taking over the store," complains
Robert Downey, a partner at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and chairman
of the Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's main
trade group. He says his group "will do our darned best" to
get Congress to pass new laws that allow banks in the
securities business -- but with heavy restrictions -- and
give securities firms some bank-related privileges, too.
   Mr. Downey says the securities association stands by its
"financial reform" plan put forth last year. As he describes
the plan: "You can do anything, Mr. Bank, but you can't have
federal deposit insurance involved, and we get some kind of
access to the Fed, as banks do, in times of crisis."
   Other securities industry officials, not sure of what
regulators or Congress will do, are hoping that old-fashioned
market forces will keep the bankers in their place.
   "Banks certainly have an embarrassing record for running
the banking business in the 1980s; I guess that qualifies
them for trying our business," says Benjamin F. Edwards III,
chairman of the A.G. Edwards Inc. brokerage firm in St.
Louis. He adds, "I think we do a lousy job in the banking
business," such as in certain failures in making loans, "and
it would surprise me if the banks do a good job in the
securities business."
   Sorrell Mathes, a top stock underwriting official at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says the underwriting business -- in
which a financial firm buys stocks or bonds from a corporate
issuer and then resells them to investors -- requires a vast
infrastructure, including a big research operation. "That is
an expensive project to build," he warns.
   Such courage aside, the securities industry is at a
distinct disadvantage going into next year's debate over
drafting new legislation, congressional staffers say. "At
this point, the banking industry doesn't have to ask for
much," said one Senate aide. "They have most of what they
want." Instead, he said, "The securities industry is being
put in a position where they have to beg for banking powers
without having much in terms of bargaining chips."
   Indeed, with the Fed giving them so much of what they
want, many bankers say they almost needn't bother arguing for
more power from Congress.
   Bankers have "less incentive" to go to a legislative
solution, said Richard Whiting, general counsel of the
Association of Bank Holding Companies, a trade group for
large banking firms. "They feel they have gotten favorable
rulings from the regulatory process."
   The Senate Banking Committee this year has held a dozen or
so days of hearings to lay the groundwork for altering the
1933 Glass-Steagall Act and the Bank Holding Company Act, two
pieces of Depression-era legislation that define the
boundaries of banking and securities. The laws, passed in
response to the wave of bank failures after the 1929
stock-market crash, divorced the banking and securities
businesses.
   Both bankers and securities firms think the Senate will
move next year to break down the barriers even further than
they have in recent years.
   "We take it as a given that the Senate will do something,"
says James McLaughlin, director of trust and securities at
the American Bankers Association. "The question is what will
the House do."
   Securities firms got some cheer on Friday from the House
banking-committee head, Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), who
called the Fed's move "irresponsible." The congressman said
it "willy-nilly adds massive new risks to the banking system
at a time when the taxpayer-supported insurance fund is
strained to its outermost limits."
   The securities industry says that the Fed is making a
mistake with its view that the strong capital base of banks
like J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. will allow them to safely exercise
their new stock-underwriting power.
   "Drexel had plenty of capital until last year," says Mr.
Downey, referring to the now-collapsed securities firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.; banks that once had adequate capital
have failed, as well. "It's just not enough to say, `Just
raise capital.'"
   If the securities association fails in Congress, it might
sue to block the banks' increasing freedoms. "We're not
ruling it out," says Mr. Downey.
   Up to now, the association's lawyers have failed to fight
off inroads into other areas of the securities business
besides stocks, such as corporate bonds. However, "equities
are the ultimate. Maybe the court would listen to that," Mr.
Downey says.
   Meanwhile, every sector of the financial-services industry
seems to be scrambling to protect its franchise -- including
the mutual-funds industry.
   "There is only one power the regulators have not given
banks: underwriting and sponsoring of mutual funds," says
Matthew Fink, general counsel of the Investment Company
Institute, the mutual fund trade group.
   Mr. Fink says his group, like the securities association,
wants a bill that replaces Glass-Steagall and the Bank
Holding Company Act. But this would be only as long as
federal securities laws governed and there were "amendments
to protect mutual funds," he says.
