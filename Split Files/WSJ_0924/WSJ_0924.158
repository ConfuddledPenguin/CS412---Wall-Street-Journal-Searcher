   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. -- Tyco Toys Inc. said Nasta
International Inc. found Tyco's revised bid to be fair and
recommended that stockholders tender their shares.
   As previously reported, the companies signed a definitive
agreement for Tyco to acquire Nasta for a sweetened price of
$1.25 a share, up from $1. Nasta is a New York maker of
lower-priced toys.

   As of last Monday 607,965 shares were tendered under the
original offer, which would increase Tyco's stake in Nasta to
86% from its current 74% interest.
