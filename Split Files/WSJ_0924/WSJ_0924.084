   BRASILIA, Brazil -- When Fernando Collor de Mello
addresses the United Nations General Assembly today, he'll be
saying a lot of new things for a Brazilian president.
   The leader of a country denounced internationally for
environmental destruction will emphasize his concern for the
ecology. The president of a nation long viewed as one of the
world's most protectionist will talk of free markets and
economic liberalization. Denounced recently in an Amnesty
International report as a country where extermination squads
run rampant, Brazil will stress human rights. And viewed
suspiciously as a country trying to build an atomic bomb and
help such countries as Iraq and Libya enhance their military
potential, Brazil now affirms its commitment to peaceful use
of nuclear energy and disarmament.

   "The message I will bring to the U.S. is that there's a
profound economic and cultural revolution going on in
Brazil," Mr. Collor said Friday in an interview on the eve of
his departure for a week-long visit to the U.S. "We are
establishing the conditions for the free market to operate.
We are preparing seriously to enter the First World."
   Brazil still has a ways to go. Its monthly inflation rate
of about 13% is still more than twice that of major
industrialized countries, income distribution is among the
most unfair in the world and many here complain that their
economic situation is getting worse, not better.
   But many Brazilians also agree that the country is
undergoing a sea change six months after Mr. Collor took
office, although he is sometimes criticized as authoritarian
and even if there are often more words and publicity stunts
than concrete results. In the latest sign of his government's
no-nonsense attitude, Brazil Thursday ordered the closing and
liquidation of four state banks and four official lending
agencies for "serious irregularities."
   Sitting ramrod-straight behind his desk throughout the
interview, the 41-year-old Mr. Collor, his hair flecked with
gray, made the following points:
   -- Brazil will resist pressure to make a token foreign
debt payment as it prepares to resume negotiations with
creditors, but the country hopes to sign an accord it can
comply with to avoid new debt payment suspensions in the
future.
   -- The Persian Gulf crisis "creates difficulties" for his
bold anti-inflation plan that will need to be solved
"creatively," with cooperation among the government, unions
and employers to prevent excessive wage and price increases.
   -- Mr. Collor welcomed President George Bush's "Initiative
for the Americas" as consistent with plans for greater South
American economic integration and said he hoped to give it
"practical content as soon as possible."
   -- He said Brazil's controversial nuclear program is
undergoing a "profound re-evaluation" to reorient it toward
peaceful uses and said this should be done under the control
of society rather than under a "veil of secrecy."
   He affirmed his government's commitment to the "fight" to
save the Amazon rain forest and called for more international
cooperation in ecological matters.
   Regarding the sweeping anti-inflation plan he enforced
when he took office, which included an 18-month freeze on
almost half the money circulating in the Brazilian economy,
Mr. Collor said the drop in the monthly inflation rate to 13%
from 84% largely without price controls is "already a great
victory" but "much remains to be done."
   Acknowledging that the plan has aggravated Brazil's
already "shameful" income distribution, Mr. Collor said the
adjustment plan isn't an end in itself but aims to give the
state the means to meet Brazil's pressing housing,
educational and health needs and reduce social inequalities.
   He appealed to Brazilian society to help him attain this
aim by entering into a "national understanding," a sort of
pact that would, among other things, prevent "wild
capitalists" from making excessive profits through price
mark-ups and "radical unionists" from pushing for
wage-and-price indexation. Discussions on this pact are to
begin this week.
   As Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor, readies
itself to negotiate with its creditors next month -- an
essential step to obtain a recently approved $2 billion
standby loan from the International Monetary Fund -- Mr.
Collor and debt negotiator Jorio Dauster, in a separate
interview, said Brazil's payments capacity was linked to its
future economic growth.
   "The question isn't how much the country can grow after
paying its debt, but how much we can pay after guaranteeing
our economic growth," Mr. Collor said.
   Pressed by creditors to make a token payment on some of
the approximately $10 billion in arrears Brazil has
accumulated since it suspended interest and capital payments
on most of its $114 billion foreign debt last year, Brazilian
officials urged bankers to take a long-term view.
   Comparing Brazil to a company whose shareholders have
ousted the old management and replaced it with a new team
that's cleaning up the mess, Mr. Collor said "one can't
require that this company pay such a sum as to impede the
success" of this cleaning-up process. Added Mr. Dauster: "Our
payments capacity is a dynamic concept: as we start to grow,
it will become much bigger."
   Bankers and diplomats retort, however, that Brazil also
has to take a long-term view and will have to quickly
normalize relations with the international financial
community if it wants to obtain foreign financing to help it
grow.
