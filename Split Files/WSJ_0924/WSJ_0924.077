   CHICAGO -- U.S. fliers, already hit with sizable fare
increases on domestic flights, face paying more to travel
overseas.
   The Transportation Department is expected to disclose
today that it is allowing fares to climb 5% to 10% on
international tickets, starting Oct. 1. Before becoming
effective, the higher fares would still require other
nations' approval.

   Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant transportation secretary
for policy and international affairs, said late Friday that
the department plans to cite "extraordinary circumstances
created by the recent invasion of Kuwait."
   Mr. Murphy said the department decided that the fare
increase, which was proposed by an airline industry trade
group, is justifiable because events in the Middle East "have
generated sudden and extreme fluctuations in the prices
carriers must pay for fuel."
   The average cost of jet fuel, one of the industry's
largest expenses, hovered near $1 a gallon late last week.
That is almost 70% more than the average 60 cents a gallon
that airlines paid before Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Since the invasion, U.S. carriers have raised their
domestic fares 5.3% and are laying plans to increase them
again by 4.2% on Oct. 1.
   The U.S. government's approval would help clear the way
for a world-wide increase in international fares. Many other
nations are also considering whether to permit an increase in
international fares.
   While U.S. fares aren't regulated by the government,
prices of tickets for international flights are set by
bilateral pacts with many nations. These pacts typically
require that a carrier must receive approval by both
countries in order to change prices.
   In this case, most of the world's airlines are lobbying
for government approval through their Geneva-based trade
group, the International Air Transport Association. Earlier
this month, the airlines devised an agreement among
themselves on how much of an increase to request.
   While such a price-setting meeting would be illegal for
U.S. carriers on domestic routes, the international trade
group is immune from antitrust regulations.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner was thought to be
skeptical about the need for fuel-related fare increases.
However, U.S. airline executives convinced him in talks last
month that the carriers face steep financial losses from
their higher fuel expenses, according to a source familiar
with the talks.
   Earlier this month, AMR Corp.'s Chairman Robert Crandall
projected that results from the last half of 1990 will be
"stinko." AMR is the parent company of American Airlines.
   "We're pleased that the department understands our need
for the increase," said David O'Connor, IATA's regional
director to the U.S. "We would rather have lower-priced fuel
and lower-priced fares. But most of the airlines are
suffering right now with revenue falling short of cost."
   The department is expected to approve a 7% fare increase
on most international flights. On flights within Europe,
fares would rise 5%. Fares would rise 6% on flights from
Iran, the Republic of Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Fares would
rise 6% on flights involving Ireland and the U.K.
   Fares on flights from Canada would jump 8%. One of the
largest fare increases would be a 10% rise on flights from
Greece.
   These increases are slightly larger than a first round of
fare increases that swept through the international market
late last winter. At the time, jet fuel prices were also
rising. Fuel supplies had tightened because refiners were
shifting their production to heating oil to meet demand
during the unusually cold winter.
   Until this year, fuel-related fare increases had been rare
since the oil price spikes of the 1970s. On U.S. domestic
routes, the fare increases are coming at a time when the
carriers already face sluggish demand. Industry analysts say
that traffic on the international routes is relatively
strong, and they expect fliers to more readily accept the
fare increases.
   The Transportation Department also is expected to disclose
today that it is approving a so-called war-risk surcharge
that allows airlines to levy an extra fee to cover the
increasing cost of insuring flights to Middle East
destinations.
   Terms of the surcharge probably would be broad. The
department is expected to give airlines the latitude to set
the amount of the surcharge, its lifespan and what flights it
would affect. According to Transportation Department
officials, the war-risk surcharge is the first of its kind to
be approved in recent memory.
   The department also is expected to approve increases of 6%
to 10% in cargo rates involving most countries. That, too, is
scheduled to take effect Oct. 1.
