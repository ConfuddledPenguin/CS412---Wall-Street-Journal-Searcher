   CAPETOWN -- South Africa's President Frederick W. De
Klerk, who is scheduled to lunch with President Bush today,
knows not to expect the kind of reception accorded Nelson
Mandela. Yet he is at least as important to South Africa's
future as Mr. Mandela: Archbishop Desmond Tutu has proposed
that the two men be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly.
   Mr. De Klerk's decision to release all political prisoners
and unban organizations like the African National Congress,
the Communist Party and the Pan Africanist Congress, without
requiring them first to qualify their long-standing
commitment to the "armed struggle," normalized South African
politics. South African politics, for so long dominated by a
constituency of 5 million whites, have become the politics of
more than 35 million people.

   Now a new pattern of race relations, free of apartheid and
discrimination, has to be worked out. Jobs are required on a
massive scale to keep pace with the country's 3% annual
population growth. The democratic culture in South Africa is
skin-deep: and the prerequisites for democracy -- wide-spread
literacy, adequate and equitably distributed incomes,
industrialization and urbanization, shared values, and a
shared sense of nationhood -- are at best weakly present.
   The transition to non-racialism could still be disrupted
either by a resurgence of Afrikaner nationalism, or by
intra-black ethnic rivalry, or by the violence of the "lost
generations," the young blacks who dropped out of school and
society after 1976, and are now largely beyond the reach of
the main political organizations.
   But the transition itself is irreversible. American
anti-apartheid organizations understandably claim that the
sanctions in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986,
have been instrumental in bringing about the change. I
disagree with this view, but the disagreement is now
academic. The question Americans should be asking now is not:
"What do we do to end apartheid?" but rather "How do we help
South Africans achieve a non-racial democracy?" Mr. De
Klerk's visit is the occasion to begin to answer that
question.
   In the first place, Americans should make their experience
in race relations more readily available to South Africa. The
American lesson for South Africa is that individuals and
societies can change. Because the American attitude toward
South Africa has been so moralistic, Americans have refused
to recognize that their experience in race relations -- both
the successes and the failures of residential desegregation,
affirmative action, rights of voluntary association,
definitions of individual and group rights -- are also
relevant in South Africa's circumstances.
   No issue is more important to South Africa's future than
the form of its economy. While the present economy, with its
racial disparities in income, wealth and public spending, is
unacceptable to the majority of South Africans, the simple
expedient of "nationalization" will not work either. Here,
too, outsiders can contribute.
   South Africa will need a great deal of foreign investment,
and not just for economic reasons. Multinational
corporations, and their South African equivalents have helped
to ameliorate some of the worst of the hardships of South
African life. Will TransAfrica representatives turn up at
U.S. shareholder meetings to ask chief executives, "Why is
your company not active in South Africa?"
   Alan Keyes, a former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, has argued that America's objective should be to
help "South African blacks become richer rather than poorer,
stronger rather than weaker, more hopeful rather than more
desperate." By promoting "black empowerment" through the
trade unions, through education and training, and by
assisting black small business, the U.S. can create a
situation in which more equal bargaining is possible.
   Finally, while there is no need at the moment for outside
facilitators in South Africa's constitutional negotiations,
hitches will occur. Mr. De Klerk's visit gives President Bush
a chance to demonstrate that the U.S. can adopt an
even-handed approach to the situation.
   For more than a decade, many American politicians have
used South Africa to win votes in American politics. But
South Africa's significance transcends apartheid. If South
Africans can live together in peace and harmony, then no
country in the world with similar problems has reason to
throw up its hands and say: "We cannot find the answer]"
