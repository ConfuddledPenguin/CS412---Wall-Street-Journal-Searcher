   TOKYO -- Japan's most influential political power broker
was scheduled to fly today to North Korea on an unusual --
and risky -- diplomatic mission.
   Shin Kanemaru, who heads the biggest faction of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, hopes his trip will help bring
about an improvement in Tokyo's ties with Pyongyang. In
particular, Mr. Kanemaru would like to bring back two
Japanese seamen held in North Korea as spies since 1983. In
return, he's holding out the lure of Japanese financial and
technological aid.

   Domestically, Mr. Kanemaru's reputation as the power
behind Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is already growing; a
successful diplomatic trip would enhance his influence by
demonstrating that he's more than just a tough political
infighter.
   But some Japanese politicos worry about Mr. Kanemaru's
lack of international experience, and they fear that the
unpredictable North Koreans won't prove as pliable as Mr.
Kanemaru hopes. "He's wading into areas he's weak at," says
political commentator Minoru Morita. "If the North Korea trip
fails, he will definitely lose power."
   Although Mr. Kanemaru is a former deputy prime minister
and has held several cabinet posts, he currently holds no
official government position. He's visiting North Korea as an
emissary of the LDP, to meet Kim Il Sung and other North
Korean officials in their capacities as party leaders.
Foreign Ministry bureaucrats have participated in the
preparations for the trip, but their attitude toward it has
been far from enthusiastic.
   Certainly no one would mistake Mr. Kanemaru for a member
of the striped-pants set. The craggy-faced, 76-year-old looks
like the former judo fighter that he is, and his background
is all in Japan's grimy political wars, rather than in the
more prestigious bureaucracy. Where most of Japan's elite
bureaucrats went to Tokyo University, Mr. Kanemaru, the son
of a rural sake-brewing family, went to Tokyo Agricultural
College. He has been a member of the lower house of the Diet,
or parliament, since 1958.
   Over the years, Mr. Kanemaru has developed a strong base
of support in Japan's construction and telecommunications
industries, close ties with key opposition-party leaders and
a certain genius for capturing the national mood on an issue.
But perhaps the most important factor in consolidating his
power was the Recruit scandal of 1988 and 1989.
   All the other main power brokers in the LDP received
shares in a Recruit Co. subsidiary before they were offered
to the public, and the scandal's taint has limited their
ability to hold government or party posts and to influence
affairs. Mr. Kanemaru, who wasn't touched by the scandal,
moved into the vacuum.
   Mr. Kanemaru, along with his erstwhile ally, former Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, picked Mr. Kaifu as prime minister
last August precisely because he lacked any political power
base of his own in the party, and therefore could be
controlled. But in recent months it has become increasingly
clear that Mr. Takeshita and Mr. Kanemaru are no longer on
good terms, and that it's Mr. Kanemaru who pulls the strings.
   In fact, the perception that Mr. Kanemaru is the most
powerful figure is so widespread that some contrarians think
it has to be wrong. "This is a deliberate illusion and myth
propagation by the consolidated powers-that-be within the
Japanese political power structure," says a policy aide to
several LDP Diet members.
   But if it's a myth, it's very convincingly done. When two
cabinet posts had to be filled recently, the Japanese press
was full of stories describing how Mr. Kanemaru and LDP
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa made the selections. Prime
Minister Kaifu's role, according to the press accounts, was
to wait for Mr. Kanemaru to inform him of the decision.
   Like many leading Japanese politicians, Mr. Kanemaru is
generally conservative, but not known for any particular
ideological or policy insights. His views are often shaped by
pragmatic considerations.
   Mr. Kanemaru is famous for speaking out boldly on an issue
-- and also, at times, for having to correct himself later.
Last spring he caused a minor sensation by suggesting that
Japan should be willing, for starters, to accept two of the
four Northern islands it's demanding from the Soviet Union as
the price of warmer relations. But two days later, after
considerable adverse reaction, Mr. Kanemaru apologized for
his failure to express himself adequately and reaffirmed the
official position.
   Despite his power, Mr. Kanemaru has never shown any
ambition to be prime minister himself. Some say that's
because he knows his own limitations. Others say it's because
in Japan, it's easier to exercise real power from behind the
scenes.
   Throughout much of his political career, his main aim was
to make his ally, Mr. Takeshita, prime minister. The two
entered the Diet the same year, and in 1966 Mr. Takeshita's
daughter married Mr. Kanemaru's son. The two men seemed to
have a pact dividing the labor, taking advantage of their
different styles: Mr. Takeshita, the more cerebral and
methodical of the two, would be the front man, and collect
the political money. Mr. Kanemaru, the swaggering tough guy,
would funnel the money to friends (and even, sometimes,
enemies) and fight the nastier fights.
   But after Mr. Takeshita finally became prime minister in
1987, the differing styles began to seem more clashing than
complementary. Their uneasy relations came to a head when Mr.
Takeshita, forced to step down because of the Recruit
scandal, chose Sosuke Uno as a successor without consulting
Mr. Kanemaru. Matters have only gotten worse since.
   Today, thanks to Recruit, Mr. Kanemaru is the chairman of
the Takeshita faction, as it continues to be called, and the
main support for the otherwise weak Mr. Kaifu. Were Mr.
Kanemaru to lose power, Mr. Kaifu's administration would have
a tough time surviving. So if Mr. Kanemaru's trip to North
Korea is a bust, the impact on Japanese politics could be
destabilizing.
   Ultimately, says Mr. Morita, the commentator, the logic
for Mr. Kanemaru's current journey lies in the assumption
that North Korea really needs Japanese economic help, and is
willing to make compromises to get it.
