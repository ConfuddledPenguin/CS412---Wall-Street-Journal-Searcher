   LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. extended its $22-a-share
tender offer for the 2,175,945 shares of Caesars New Jersey
Inc. it doesn't already own to Oct. 17 from last Friday. The
offer was initially set to expire in August.
   Caesar's World, a hotel and casino operator, has agreed in
principle to make an additional payment to Caesars New Jersey
shareholders of 25 cents a share as part of a legal
settlement brought by some holders of the latter. Final court
approval isn't expected for at least two months.
