   Aluminum has a new shine these days on the London Metal
Exchange. Prices for the metal passed $1 a pound last week, a
rise of 43% in the past 50 days.
   The cash price in London traded up to $1.0250 before
easing slightly Friday to 99.8 cents.

   The surge has put the price of aluminum ingot at its
highest level in more than a year and a half, raising
aluminum companies' earnings potential and their stocks'
prices on Wall Street.
   The reasons for the move, though, are anybody's guess.
Market watchers, some of whom seem a bit perplexed, diverge
widely in explaining the metal's erratic rise, which has
exceeded even the most bullish expectations. But they tend to
agree that the market's top is near, if it hasn't already
been reached.
   The laws of supply and demand clearly contribute to
somewhat higher prices. Demand, while slack in the U.S., is
growing strongly overseas. As a result, U.S. producers are
smelting new metal at 97% to 98% of capacity. And producer
inventories remain lean: Metal stocks in house total just
five weeks' supply, against the 14 weeks the industry carried
before the last recession. One metals trader says aluminum
has the strongest demand of all the base metals and that
demand is expected to outpace smelting capacity.
   One fundamentalist, aluminum analyst Vahid Fathi of
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, says the higher aluminum ingot
prices -- up from 63 cents a pound in January -- reflect the
close supply-demand balance.
   "People are beginning to realize that final demand hasn't
fallen off that precipitously despite the threat of
recession," he says. "It should give a clear sign to the
bears that things might not be as bad as they like to think."
   Americans, says Sharps Pixley Inc. metal trader Richard
Hirsch, "aren't fully aware of the strong demand for aluminum
in Europe, led by Germany, and in the Far East, led by
Japan."
   But with recession fears rampant and the U.S. automotive
and construction industries slumping, others say the
fundamentals alone aren't solid enough to justify aluminum's
giant leap. "We have not seen substantial improvements in
fundamentals in the last three weeks," says Lloyd T.
O'Carroll, corporate economist for Reynolds Metals Co.
   Instead, he and others say speculative trading is behind
much of the rise. According to this view, several factors may
be at work, including the Persian Gulf crisis, which prompted
investors to flee the currency and securities markets in
favor of commodities. A broad-based metals rally has also
pushed up copper and nickel prices. And once traders saw
prices edge up, they piled on aluminum's bandwagon, driving
prices higher still.
   The instability in the Middle East has also put on hold
some plans to expanding smelters in the area. Some traders
are gambling that a prolonged conflict could therefore mean
short supplies of aluminum toward the end of the decade.
   The leading rumor in commodity circles suggests that
Switzerland-based Marc Rich &amp; Co., the world's largest
aluminum dealer, is trying to drive up prices. But a
spokesman for the company denies the rumor and says the
current price rally didn't start with Marc Rich but with the
activity of another prominent trading concern. Officials of
that concern couldn't be reached for comment.
   Whatever the cause, there are widespread warnings that
aluminum prices can't go much higher -- and that if they do,
they'll start hurting business for aluminum makers. "I think
it's going down from here," says aluminum analyst Peter
Merner, who thinks the demand for aluminum has been
overstated.
   In the short term, higher aluminum ingot prices will boost
aluminum makers' profits. Aluminum companies have already
raised prices for common alloy sheet metal used in
construction and transportation. The higher ingot prices may
also push up prices for aluminum extrusions and castings.
However, companies are expected to hold the line on beverage
container sheet, as Aluminum Co. of America, the industry
leader, has committed itself to stable can sheet prices.
   Volatile price swings have long been the bane of the
aluminum industry. In the long term, if the price sticks at a
level above $1.05 a pound, analysts and aluminum companies
fear it will harm demand among automotive and transportation
customers. Wild gyrations in ingot prices also heighten
customers' insecurity.
   Mr. O'Carroll says aluminum makers like to see prices at
the current level, but he fears that the pattern is not
sustainable. Ultimately, he says, "the volatility hurts" the
aluminum business.
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Livestock and Meats
                                                                                                       

   Prices of pork belly futures contracts might come under
some downward pressure at the start of trading today.
   A monthly survey released by the Agriculture Department
after the close Friday showed slightly more than the expected
number of U.S. pork bellies in cold storage. Pork bellies are
used to make bacon.
   The government said that on Sept. 1 it counted 23.1
million pounds of pork bellies. That still was a 53% decline
from the big stockpile that existed on the same date last
year.
   Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.,
St. Louis, said the survey signals that price competition
between meats might be strong at Thanksgiving this year.
   According to the report, 591.6 million pounds of turkeys
were in cold storage on Sept. 1, a record for that date and
3% more than on the same 1989 date. Many of those turkeys
will be sold for Thanksgiving in competition with ham.
   This week, traders will focus on a quarterly pig crop
report that is slated for release after the close of trading
Friday.
   According to Thomas Morgan, an analyst at Sterling
Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill., the report will
probably show that the high hog prices and strong profits
that prevailed in the first half of the year are finally
prompting farmers to expand their hog herds.
   A tight supply of hogs helped push retail prices of pork
up to record levels this year. Mr. Morgan said he expects the
government survey to show that farmers intend to have 5% more
sows producing piglets during September, October and
November, compared with the 1989 period.
                                                                                                       

   Gold
                                                                                                       

   Gold appears ready to break out of its current trading
range, some analysts say.
   On Friday, the December futures contract fell to $392 an
ounce before recovering to end at $394.50, up 30 cents. This
performance prompted William O'Neill, senior futures
strategist for Merrill Lynch, to say that the contract might
be establishing a base to move over $400.
   However, he said, the failure to move above Friday's peak
of $399 was yet another case of the prevailing pattern in
recent gold trading: Prices rise moderately, attracting
selling that stifles the advance.
   Usually, producer selling is the rallykiller, but that
didn't appear to be the case this time, according to Mr.
O'Neill. He attributed the selling mostly to dealers and
"locals," or traders dealing for their own accounts.
   Despite this failed move, a strong fundamental foundation
for gold is being built by the Persian Gulf crisis, which is
being translated into surging oil prices, and by growing
concern over problems at banks and savings-and-loans, Mr.
O'Neill says.
                                                                                                       

   Sugar
                                                                                                       

   The October contract ended at 10.90 cents a pound, down
0.24 cent, but a late rebound from a low of 10.76 cents
indicates the market still has a strong underpinning.
   Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers, said
that with the harvest just beginning in most producing
countries, new supplies may not become available for purchase
for some time.
   Working stocks have been drawn down to minimum levels,
which may force major users such as the Soviet Union and
China to make further purchases, she said.
   "This potential demand is the principal reason that the
October price has been able to hold up on dips under 11
cents," Ms. Kaul said.
