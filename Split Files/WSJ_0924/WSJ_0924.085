   BRUSSELS -- The new European Community law on mergers
control has taken effect, giving the EC Commission a
broadened role in scrutinizing corporate mergers and
buy-outs.
   The legislation, approved last December after more than 17
years of wrangling, will concentrate authority in the
commission to clear the largest European crossborder mergers,
according to EC competition laws.

   "There is now a clear division of responsibility between
the European Commission and the member states for assessing
mergers and takeovers," said Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
commissioner for competition affairs.
   "It will be a simpler world for business, which will no
longer face the multiple jeopardy of seeking clearance for
such deals both from Brussels and from national capitals."
   But experts say the law also gives the commission more
teeth and stricter standards than it had in the past to
enforce EC competition rules.
   That could mean that some agreements made in the past
wouldn't be approved under the new rules.
   Under the law, the EC Commission will examine large
mergers for their impact on competition in the EC. It will be
empowered to change, suspend, or block mergers that hurt
competition or create a company with a dominant position.
   Mergers in which the companies involved have combined
revenues of 5 billion European currency units ($6.55
billion), of which at least two of the parties each have 250
million Europen currency units in EC sales, will be reviewed
by the commission.
   Smaller transactions will be referred back to national
authorities.
   Those thresholds can be reviewed in 2 1/2 years.
   The new law requires companies to notify the commission of
merger plans within one week of their agreement or
announcement, providing detailed information in the
notification. The commission must notify a company within one
month whether it will oppose the merger.
   Merger specialists say the new procedures should
facilitate cross-border acquisitions by creating a clear path
for getting them approved, eliminating potential conflicts
among national authorities and between EC and national laws.
   "The advantages outweigh the uncertainties," said Carter
Eltzroth, a lawyer with the Brussels office of law firm
Morgan Lewis Bockius, based in Philadelphia. "It gets rid of
the risk of conflicting decisions."
   Lawyers also praised the emphasis on economic, rather than
social or political considerations, in assessing mergers'
impact.
   "When big deals were going on in recent years, people
would be saying to one another `Wish we had the EC law now,'"
said Donald Holley, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp;
Hamilton, a New York law firm with a Brussels office.
   But the law also toughens the benchmark the commission can
use for blocking a merger. In the past, under EC case law,
the commission could only intervene in mergers where one of
the concerns had a dominant position before the merger.
   A dominant position was flexibly defined as a 40% market
share under EC case law.
   Under the new legislation, the commission will be able to
block a merger that would create a dominant position.
   "Before, one of the companies would have needed a 40%" to
prompt action by the commission, said Cleary Gottlieb's Mr.
Holley. "Now if the two have 40%" the commission can
intervene, he said.
   Experts say the amount of information companies must
provide at the time a merger is announced will be greater
than the requirements companies face now, or that companies
face in the U.S.
   The initial notification "is a bother, and sometimes an
expensive bother," one lawyer said.
   Nonetheless, experts gave the commission high marks for
its efforts to gear up to its new task.
   "They have good people in the sector and have made an
extraordinary effort to be prepared," Mr. Holley said.
