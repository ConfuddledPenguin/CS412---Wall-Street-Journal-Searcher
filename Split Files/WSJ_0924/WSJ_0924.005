   NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees face the Baltimore
Orioles at Yankee Stadium tonight in a matchup of two of the
worst teams in the league. Will anyone care about the
outcome?
   Even though neither team has a chance at the pennant,
ratings for the game, presented on two regional sports
networks -- Madison Square Garden and Home Team Sports --
will do just fine, thank you.

   Business is booming for the nation's two dozen or so
regional sports cable networks. Some of the biggest names in
sports advertising -- Anheuser-Busch and Coors beers,
Jeep-Eagle trucks and Toyota autos -- increasingly are
turning to regional sports networks as an attractive, and
especially flexible, alternative to the Big Three networks
and national cable rivals such as ESPN.
   The regionals' reach is growing, to a combined 30 million
cable homes, up more than 40% in the past year alone. Their
ad revenue is climbing nicely, increasing almost 50% a year
since 1985 and exceeding $100 million for the first time this
year, estimates Paul Kagan Associates.
   "We're in the position of a lot of media folks, who are
just now appreciating how much the regionals can grow and
what they offer," says Gene DeWitt of DeWitt Media, a media
buyer for sponsors. "Their share of the business is going to
grow."
   Ed Frazier, president of Prime Network, a loose
affiliation of about 15 regional sports channels that swap
programming, said the regionals "have reached a critical mass
to the point where we're an interesting alternative." But he
adds, "The other thing advertisers are looking for now is
fiscal responsibility."
   Fiscal responsibility is the hard part: making sure that
commercials actually air when they should in the various
regions, and ensuring the spots reach as many viewers as the
regional networks had promised. The trouble is that sponsors
have no way of accurately measuring the regional ratings
because A.C. Nielsen Co. doesn't do it. The regional networks
hope to address the ratings dearth, but no one knows exactly
how to go about it.
   "That's a problem for us," says Ralph Heim, a media
placement manager at Coors Brewing, which uses the regional
networks frequently to get around the exclusive lock that
Anheuser-Busch beers have on ESPN baseball games. For now,
sponsors must rely on a "reasonable leap of faith," says Mark
Reiss, Coors media director.
   The lack of hard ratings scares away some. "You can put
money into them and what are you getting for it? There's a
limit to how much we are willing to invest on gut feeling,"
says Bill Sherman, a vice president at ad agency
McCann-Erickson. So far he has avoided putting clients into
regional games because of the uncertainty over ratings and
the premium prices that many of the channels charge.
   The regionals' ad sales are thriving anyway. Two groups of
regional networks dominate the business. The largest, Prime
Network, which covers 23 million homes, is owned mostly by
cable entrepreneur Bill Daniels and Tele-Communications, the
largest cable-system operator. SportsChannel America is a
group of 10 regionals that are jointly owned by General
Electric's NBC and Cablevision Systems and reach 10 million
subscribers.
   Prime Network will take in $15 million in national ads,
and its affiliates will bring in about the same sum in local
spots this year. Two years ago, ad revenue was zilch, says
Edward Goldman, president of Group W Sports Marketing, which
handles ad sales for 13 of the channels. At SportsChannel,
president Jeff Ruhe says ad revenue is rising 35% a year and
will hit $25 million this year.
   Individual sports networks are faring just as well. At
Madison Square Garden Network, owned by Paramount
Communications, sales of commercials almost tripled last year
thanks to the addition of 45 games featuring the New York
Rangers (hockey) and the Knicks (hoops). Ad revenue is up
another 20% this year, a spokesman says. Prime Ticket, a Los
Angeles regional owned by Bill Daniels and Lakers owner Jerry
Buss, will see ad sales grow to $25 million this year from $4
million two years ago.
   Just two years ago, advertising provided only 15% of Prime
Ticket's total revenue, with fees from cable systems
providing the rest. Advertising now is half of revenue and
could rise to 80% of the pie in a few years, says Prime
Ticket President John Severino.
   Sponsors are fueling such hefty increases in part because
of an abiding belief in home-team loyalty. Last May, for
example, the Lakers playoff game on Prime Ticket was watched
by a 12.7% of all local homes, even though half the area's
households don't even get cable. The game outdrew even ABC's
top-rated hit comedy, "Roseanne."
   But advertisers also are turning to regionals because of
the flexibility they offer. "We really want to tailor our
buys to each particular region of the country," says Charles
B. Fruit, a vice president at Anheuser-Busch. In New England,
he hawks Busch beer, "whereas in the {San Francisco} Bay area
it isn't even distributed. Regional sports networks let us
manipulate the advertising we do from region to region much
more easily than on national television."
   The regionals, scrappy upstarts that they are, also go
beyond the typical 30-second spot to let sponsors partake in
a little hokum and hype. For Footlocker shoe stores, Group W
Sports Marketing made 20 spots touting different "shoe tips."
One for volleyball sneakers aired in California, while
another for shoes adorned with a map of Chicago ran in that
market.
   And during a recent hoops game on Home Team Sports, the
two announcers could be seen, on-camera, ordering a Domino's
pizza on the air, then eating the pie when it arrived within
30 minutes. Says Robert Kunath, a vice president at Group W
Sports Marketing, "What better could you ask for?"

   Young &amp; Rubicam, following a lengthy search, named Helayne
Spivak executive creative director of its flagship New York
office.
   Ms. Spivak, who began her career at Ally &amp; Gargano and
later worked at Ammirati &amp; Puris, most recently had been
executive creative director of Hal Riney &amp; Partners's
struggling New York office.
   Since it consolidated its three agency groups in April,
Y&amp;R has been looking for a single creative leader to revive
the New York agency's lackluster creative reputation.
   "There's an infectious enthusiasm about her," said Tim
Pollak, chief executive officer of Y&amp;R New York. "I think
she's going to help us do better and better things for our
clients."
   John Yost, general manager of Hal Riney in San Francisco,
said the agency hasn't decided on an executive to succeed Ms.
Spivak in New York.
