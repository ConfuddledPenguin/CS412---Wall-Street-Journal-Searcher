   MEMBERS SERVICE Corp. (Houston) -- William Lynton, 47
years old, was named chairman and chief executive of this
mergers and acquisitions concern. Mr. Lynton was formerly a
managing partner in a number of limited and general
partnerships in Houston and Dallas. He succeeds Leon R.
Hooten III, who resigned earlier this month after the company
filed suit claiming he improperly appropriated corporate
property. The two sides reached an agreement under which the
company agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and repurchase two
million shares held by Mr. Hooten. Members Service also said
it elected Arthur S. Feher Jr., a New York consultant, to its
board, succeeding James R. Beazle, who resigned from the
board but who remains a vice president at the company.
