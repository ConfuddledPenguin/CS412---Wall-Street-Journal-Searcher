   Nichols Institute said earnings for its third quarter,
ending Sunday, could be 10% lower than the highest projection
published by analysts. The medical diagnostic testing company
said it was referring to an estimate of $2.4 million, or 16
cents a share.
   In the year-ago quarter, the San Juan Capistrano, Calif.,
company earned $1.3 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue
of $32.8 million.

   The company said it had unexpected difficulties in
consolidating the operations of Physicians Medical
Laboratories, a company it acquired in January of this year,
with its existing Medlab Inc. operation in Portland, Ore.
   Dr. Albert L. Nichols, president, chief executive officer
and chairman, said the company has terminated several
managers from Physicians Medical Laboratories and installed
new managers from within Nichols.
