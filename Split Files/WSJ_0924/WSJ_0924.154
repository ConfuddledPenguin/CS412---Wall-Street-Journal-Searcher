   As a nurse entrepreneur, I was very pleased to be
interviewed for your Aug. 24 article entitled "Nurses Shift
to Taking Care of Business." But you say I left my career in
nursing to start Gail Wick &amp; Associates, a consulting and
placement company. I left bedside nursing to start a
health-care consulting and placement company. I still use my
valuable knowledge and skills as a nurse to run a company
that focuses on helping health-care providers give the
highest-quality care to patients in a cost-effective manner.
I am first and foremost a registered nurse and very proud of
it.
