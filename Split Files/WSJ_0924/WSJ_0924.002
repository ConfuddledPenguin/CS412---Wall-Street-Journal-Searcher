   Asil Nadir, the chairman and chief executive of Polly Peck
International PLC, never seems to get enough respect.
   Last year when negotiating the largest purchase of his
career -- his company's $875 million acquisition of the Del
Monte fresh-fruits business of RJR Nabisco Inc. -- the
sellers experienced a few trepidations. They wanted a
commitment for Polly Peck to make a minimum, steep $25
million payment on the sale. Such financial insurance was
needed because Mr. Nadir wasn't well-known in New York,
explains a lawyer involved in the transaction. And he adds
that even in London, Polly Peck's base, Mr. Nadir "has never
been an establishment figure."

   Now, after three turbulent decades building a
mini-conglomerate that includes Del Monte pineapples and
Sansui stereos, the Turkish-Cypriot immigrant finds himself
in an all-out battle with British market regulators to
salvage his company's stock price and his own reputation.
   Last month, he was publicly rebuked by London's Stock
Exchange for announcing and then five days later dropping
what the exchange claims was an ill-prepared plan to take his
company private. And though there isn't evidence of personal
wrongdoing by him, Britain's Serious Fraud Office last week
questioned Mr. Nadir and searched offices of a London firm
that manages Nadir family investments; the fraud office is
investigating allegations of, among other things,
insider-trading in Polly Peck shares by at least one former
employee of the investment-management firm. As word of the
fraud office action leaked out Thursday, Polly Peck stock
crashed, sinking 55% before trading was halted.
   The day's trading "wasn't a stock market; it was a
lynching," says a London financial analyst sympathetic to
Polly Peck. The price when trading was halted -- 108 pence a
share (US$2.02) -- "is ludicrously cheap" at just 2.3 times
the company's 1989 per-share earnings, adds another analyst,
John Campbell of County NatWest Securities Ltd.
   Mr. Nadir isn't granting interviews, but he and his
associates now appear to be circling the wagons. After a
lengthy meeting Friday, the Polly Peck board issued a terse
statement saying it "deplores the recent attacks on the
chairman." Mr. Nadir has told Polly Peck colleagues that he's
seeking a public statement from the fraud office clarifying
his role in its inquiries; he indicated to colleagues, a
Polly Peck source says, that he believes the fraud office
hasn't any further questions for him. The Stock Exchange,
meanwhile, is pushing the company for a statement by this
afternoon explaining the cause of its stock-trading turmoil.
   Continuing the defense, last night the company said its
board had formally requested Britain's Trade and Industry
Department to "appoint independent inspectors to investigate
and report under the appropriate section" of British law. A
department spokesman didn't have any comment, beyond saying
that such independent probes -- generally led by a specially
appointed lawyer and accountant -- are rare in British
business.
   The company, explaining its request, criticized
regulators' handling of the case so far and said it's
"unlikely to be able to find a fair hearing" without a
special probe.
   Also last night, Mr. Nadir lashed out at the British
press, issuing a brief statement saying his lawyers plan to
file suit today for defamation against Times Newspapers Ltd.,
publisher of the Sunday Times, and the Observer Ltd.,
publisher of the Observer. Both London Sunday newspapers have
been running in-depth reports about the Polly Peck affair,
and published articles yesterday repeating allegations by a
former Polly Peck official whom, they said, had given
evidence to the fraud office.
   And in Mr. Nadir's Turkish and Cypriot power bases, allies
are rallying to his defense. Mr. Nadir is the second-largest
press baron in Turkey, its biggest electronics manufacturer,
and the largest private employer in Turkish-controlled North
Cyprus. To help him in his hour of need, Turkish government
authorities have launched a counterattack -- publicly blaming
his troubles on Greek Cypriots.
   "There is a Greek Cypriot hand in this," charges Murat
Sungar, spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry. "The
target isn't the company or the personality {of Mr. Nadir},
but the economy of northern Cyprus," he says.
   Mr. Nadir has been here before. In early 1983, Polly Peck
stock crashed after three years of stratospheric growth, in
which the shares skyrocketed beyond #32 a share from just
nine pence apiece in a speculative bubble. It popped under a
campaign by Greek Cypriot authorities against Mr. Nadir's
company, which it claimed was exploiting land seized from
Greek Cypriots after Turkey's 1974 invasion. But the stock
fall steepened after Polly Peck's earnings began lagging
behind optimistic market forecasts -- encouraged by Mr.
Nadir's own bullish pronouncements.
   After arriving in Britain from his native north Cyprus in
1963, Mr. Nadir built a small empire in the rag trade of
London's poor East End. His garment business, Wearwell PLC,
went public in 1973; and after the partition of Cyprus into
Turkish and Greek enclaves, he got Turkish government aid to
start packaging and exporting Cypriot fruits and vegetables.
As his business flourished, he made a moribund British
textile concern, Polly Peck, his main holding company. Its
growth, which resumed after the 1983 stock debacle, climaxed
this year after the Del Monte fresh-fruits acquisition and
the purchase of a 70% stake in Japan's ailing Sansui Electric
Co.
   Throughout, Mr. Nadir has displayed a fondness for the
grand gesture. Once, on a visit to Turkish north Cyprus, he
was entertained at the house of a business associate. His
host happened to point to the ruin of a nearby house that
might one day be developed, spoiling his own property's
prospects. Mr. Nadir's response, the business associate says,
was sultan-like in its generosity: He promptly bought the
neighboring house and bestowed it on the business associate
as a gift.
   Associates say Mr. Nadir, with a 28% Polly Peck stake,
runs the company as a personal fiefdom. An inner circle of
longtime aides advise him and carry out orders. Thus, even
though London analysts say Polly Peck's businesses appear to
be sound and have bright futures, stock traders are focusing
on Mr. Nadir's personal battle with British authorities.
   Mr. Nadir is "totally key" to Polly Peck's future, says
County NatWest's Mr. Campbell.
