   CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia is producing nearly 90%
of its oil needs and, despite the Middle East conflict, is
"well placed" to meet its requirements, the government said.
   Alan Griffiths, minister for resources, said Australia's
oil self-sufficiency rate is up from 65% in 1983, when the
Labor Party government took office. He contended that
government deregulation of crude-oil marketing and strategies
to increase exploration have helped improve self-sufficiency.

   Production from Australia's biggest fields in Bass Strait
is declining, while output from northern offshore fields is
rising. Australia imports some oil, but overall is a net
exporter of energy, because it is the world's biggest coal
exporter and sells liquefied natural gas, uranium and
light-crude oil.
   The price of domestically produced crude is kept close to
international levels. Mr. Griffiths said Australia can't
artificially restrict prices for crude, because such controls
would cause producers to export more crude, reduce
exploration and force up oil imports.
   But Canberra has insisted that oil companies slow the rise
in retail prices of gasoline since the Gulf conflict boosted
world prices. Yet gasoline prices could rise four Australian
cents a liter next week, the Service Station Association
said. Gasoline already costs more than 80 cents (66 U.S.
cents) a liter in some parts of the country. A liter is equal
to 0.26 gallon.
   Mr. Griffiths said Australia has relatively low taxes on
gasoline, and cited data showing Australian gasoline users
have been paying about 74 Australian cents a liter, compared
with the equivalent of 1.62 Australian dollars (US$1.34) in
Italy and A$1.31 in France.
