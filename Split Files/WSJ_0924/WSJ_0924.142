   IRAQ THREATENED a wide-scale Mideast war and destruction
of oil fields.
   Baghdad warned it would attack oil installations in the
region and include Israel in an all-out war if the West tried
to "strangle" its people. Baker, meanwhile, said the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council will meet
tomorrow to consider an air embargo against Iraq. The Bush
administration prepared to send Congress a roughly $10
billion arms package for Saudi Arabia. Over the weekend, the
Saudis ordered several diplomats from Jordan, Yemen and Iraq
to leave the country, asserting that they were involved in
spying for Baghdad.

congressional and business leaders to discuss ways in which
the U.S. can help in bringing about a peaceful transition
from apartheid. His visit has been clouded by an upsurge of
factional violence in black townships.
   In Johannesburg, Mandela charged that new police measures
were timed to create an appearance of calm during de Klerk's
three-day trip to the U.S.

many seats each side should have.
