   A spokesman for Computer Factory Inc. confirmed that it
received a $4-a-share takeover proposal from a San Francisco
merchant banking firm and said the board is reviewing the
plan.
   Directors of the Elmsford, N.Y., personal-computer
retailer "undoubtedly will take up" the proposal from Bay
Street Group "before any regularly scheduled meeting," the
spokesman said.

   "There may be an informal {directors} meeting early next
week, but it won't include the full board," the spokesman
added. The takeover proposal, contained in a letter to
Computer Factory's board, is valued at more than $34 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Computer Factory closed at $3.375, up 25 cents.
