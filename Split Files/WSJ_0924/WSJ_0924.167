   WASHINGTON -- Financial leaders of the seven major
industrialized nations said that the sharp increase in oil
prices could spur inflation and slow the global economy but
that their countries are experiencing "solid growth" that "is
expected to continue next year."
   In a statement released after their one-day meeting here,
the so-called Group of Seven also said -- noting the recent
appreciation of the yen -- that current exchange rates should
lead to "continued adjustment" of external imbalances, such
as the U.S. trade deficit and the large trade surpluses of
Japan and West Germany. But it urged the U.S. to "bring the
budget summit to a prompt and successful conclusion," and
urged other countries with big fiscal deficits to increase
their savings.

   The G-7, which is made up of the finance ministers and
central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada, also said that
"stability-oriented monetary policies and sound fiscal
policies constitute the correct policy response" to the risks
associated with the higher oil prices resulting from Iraq's
Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait.
   There have been tensions within the G-7 -- and also
between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department --
about the policy balance needed to control the inflation
pressures resulting from oil prices that have jumped to about
$35 a barrel from about $20 a barrel in June.
   The Treasury has urged the Federal Reserve to ease
short-term interest rates in order to boost the slowing U.S.
economy. But the Fed, citing stronger inflationary pressures
associated with the oil price rise, has resisted.
   Similarly, in the G-7 meeting, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady resisted European calls to make blunter statements
about the dangers of inflation, an administration official
said. West Germany, Britain and Canada are especially
concerned that inflation may get out of hand, particularly if
interest rates are lowered prematurely. At a news conference
after Saturday's meeting, Mr. Brady refused to rank the risks
of higher inflation and of lower economic growth.
   "The job of government is to balance itself so that it can
navigate between these two risks so we don't put ourselves at
risk from high inflation or of lowering economic growth" he
said. "I don't think you have to get into the job of favoring
one over the other."
   Mr. Brady steadfastly denied the U.S. is headed for
recession. "I don't adopt the word recession as the way we're
headed," he said. "We're in a period of slower economic
growth; the first six months of this year were slower than we
wanted and slower than they should have been, but we still
had growth that was 1.5% higher than in 1989."
   But the U.S. is now growing more slowly than Japan and the
European Community and, therefore, is more vulnerable to
recession than most other G-7 countries.
   At his news conference, Mr. Brady refused to discuss his
recent calls for lowering U.S. interest rates to boost the
economy. "I think my comments on the Fed have been clear over
time, and I don't see any reason to repeat them," he said.
   The treasury secretary did indicate, however, that he
expects interest rates to decline if there is an enforceable
and convincing budget package from the current negotiations
between the administration and the Congress. "With regard to
interest rates, the most important thing we can do is the
obvious thing: Get a budget summit agreement which takes the
government out of the position of absorbing savings that
should be used by the private sector to generate jobs and
growth," he said.
   Along with his G-7 colleagues, Mr. Brady yesterday
attended meetings of the International Monetary Fund's
powerful policy-making body, the so-called Interim Committee,
which is chaired by Canada's Finance Minister Michael Wilson.
In those talks, the finance ministers discussed how the IMF
and the World Bank should respond to the Gulf crisis. It's
likely that their response will closely follow the
recommendations outlined by the G-7, an administration
official said. Estimates for the financial needs of the
so-called frontline states -- Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- now
range from $13 billion to $16 billion through the end of
1991, the official said. The IMF and World Bank will hold
their annual meetings here tomorrow through Thursday.
   After Saturday's G-7 meeting, Mr. Wilson said, "it's
important we go through a period of slow growth" to prevent
an outbreak of inflation. Meantime, French Finance Minister
Pierre Beregovoy said, "Monetary policy must remain vigorous
but without excess -- we must avoid excess in any direction."
   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, who is
trying to wrestle U.K. inflation of about 10% a year, said
yesterday at a news conference that "inflation is the
principal evil" and that, in retrospect, there had been too
much relaxation of monetary policy in response to the October
1987 stock market crash.
   The G-7 statement also lauded international efforts to
help poorer countries hurt by the Gulf crisis and called upon
the IMF and World Bank to quickly adopt measures to help. It
said the IMF should review its compensatory and contingency
financing facility -- which lends money to countries badly
affected by external shocks -- and also the amount it lends
the countries damaged by the Gulf crisis.
   The statement also reaffirmed support for the current
international debt strategy, adding that the G-7 countries
"expect Brazil to resolve its arrears problems with its
external creditors in the context of the adoption of a formal
IMF arrangement."
   Brazil, which is currently several billions of dollars in
arrears on interest payments to its commercial bank
creditors, has submitted its economic program to the IMF and
expects to borrow $2 billion from that institution. Its bank
creditors, led by Citicorp, don't want the IMF to release
funds to Brazil until there's an agreement.
