   NEW YORK -- Banks may have won their battle for power to
underwrite corporate-stock issues, but it could be years
before stock underwriting does much to bolster their bottom
lines.
   The Federal Reserve Board's decision to grant
equity-underwriting power to J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. last week
broke down the final barrier for banks anxious to compete
head-on with Wall Street in providing financial services to
corporate America. An underwriter buys an issue of stocks or
bonds from a corporation that wants to raise money, then
resells the securities to investors, hopefully at a profit.

   But with the stock-underwriting business at a low ebb,
analysts figure the banks' new powers are more symbolic than
real, at least for now.
   "It's an important strategic issue in the long term, but
anybody who anticipates a huge windfall in the near term is
deluded," said James McDermott, director of research at
Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. "The equity markets are under
pressure, the competition is severe and profit margins are
falling."
   Bankers, though pleased that the Fed has seen fit to grant
powers denied banks since the Depression by the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act, concede that their new status isn't a
make-or-break issue.
   Bankers say stock underwriting will be one more service
among many that banks can provide to corporate clients. They
doubt that many banks, if any, will spend heavily over the
next few years to build the equity sales, trading and
research staffs that would enable them to compete
head-to-head in stock underwriting with big Wall Street
investment banks such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. or Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co.
   Instead, it appears more likely that any stock
underwriting by banks would be done as part of financing
packages that banks arrange for their corporate clients, and
which could also include bank loans and debt securities.
Right now, if raising funds through some form of stock issue
is part of a financing package, banks have to seek help from
securities dealers.
   Banks would prefer to collect profits not only from
arranging complex financings, but also from selling the
securities involved to investors. "With underwriting power,
we get all the profits," said one banker.
   The banks' new stock-underwriting powers come with
restrictions. For one thing, banks will have to segregate
their underwriting business from their banking business.
Federal officials are particularly anxious to avoid any
perception that federal desposit insurance protects risky
stock trading and underwriting activities. This means
duplicate staffs and limits on information-sharing among a
bank's lending and securities officers, and that will impede
banks from realizing the full potential of underwriting
powers.
   What's more, for the moment at least, the Fed is
restricting the amount of underwriting business a bank can
do, whether it involves corporate bonds or stocks, to 10% of
gross revenue of the bank's securities subsidiary. Bankers
complain that the 10% limit puts a crimp in their ability to
compete with Wall Street firms.
   But Robert Tortoriello, an attorney specializing in
Glass-Steagall issues, said J.P. Morgan generates large
revenue in its securities subsidiary through its activities
as a major government bond dealer. This leaves Morgan plenty
of leeway to underwrite stocks within the 10% limit, he said.
   In any event, nobody expects community banks, or even many
of the big regional banks, to ever use the new
stock-underwriting powers. Indeed, some analysts suspect that
the Federal Reserve, deeply concerned about the health of the
nation's banks, will severely limit the number of banks it
authorizes to underwrite stock offerings.
   "By approving Morgan first, which has a very strong
capital base, the Fed is sending a message that there's a
strong bias in favor of capital-strong institutions" in the
Fed's decision to award expanded banking powers, said Keefe
Bruyette's Mr. McDermott.
   Despite its lengthy and aggressive effort to win
stock-underwriting authority, J.P. Morgan officials refused
to discuss their strategy or objectives for underwriting
corporate-stock issues. "We don't want to overplay it," said
a spokesman.
   Other banks seeking stock-underwriting powers are Bankers
Trust Co., Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank, Royal Bank of
Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank.
