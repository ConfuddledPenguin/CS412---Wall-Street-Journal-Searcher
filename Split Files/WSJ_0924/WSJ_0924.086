   NEW YORK -- Sony Corp., again going to the front of the
pack in consumer electronics, is marketing two new digital
audio tape products, one for the car and one for the
waistband.
   In keeping with its strategy of creating markets for its
technology, Sony will start selling a DAT Walkman and a car
DAT player in late December. But it will have to rev up
interest in a technology that's not yet cheap and has been
hampered by political and legal wrangling over DAT taping of
copyrighted works.

   These products follow the home-unit DAT player, which Sony
launched in the U.S. in June, and position it as the first
consumer electronics company to offer a full line of DAT
products. DAT machines, like compact disk machines, play
music with almost no distortion. But unlike CDs, they also
can record music digitally.
   Although audio-industry executives have been cheering the
clarity of DAT sound for the past few years, product
development and marketing have been held back by disputes
with the recording industry over possible copyright
infringements against labeled recordings. Manufacturers
agreed last year to include a device on the machine that will
allow it to make one CD copy but not more, but a lawsuit was
filed in July in an attempt to halt Sony DAT recorder sales.
   Many other Japanese electronics manufacturers have held
back, waiting to see how the tape-pirating issue played out
in the courts.
   Not Sony. "It's businesss as usual," says Neil Vander
Dussen, president of Sony Corp. of America, Sony's U.S. unit.
"We believe DAT is certainly a mass-marketable technology."
   Indeed, analysts say Sony's success with the DAT Walkman
and car player would not only test the portable applications
of digital-based audio technology, but it would also be a key
factor in determining the future market for DAT products.
   Like most new high-tech products when they first hit the
market, Sony's latest offering won't be cheap. The TCD-D3 DAT
Walkman, which is roughly the same size and weight as
existing cassette-tape players, has a suggested retail price
of $850. The price tag on the DTX-10 car DAT player is
$1,100.
   While these initial prices may be too steep for all but
the most serious audio buffs, analysts say the DAT walkman
may have broad appeal once prices come down. Unlike portable
CD players that tend to skip when jostled by joggers or
dashing commuters, the DAT Walkman is designed to give
steady, high-quality sound despite such jiggling.
   Though price can be a critical determinant for the success
of DAT, analysts say Sony's strategy of developing a steady
stream of new products is crucial to winning consumer
confidence. Knowing that there is more than one use for a DAT
cassette could go a long way in convincing consumers that DAT
is worth the investment.
   Sony is also betting that a broader product lineup will
persuade the recording companies to back the technology. Thus
far, limited available recordings have been a big hurdle in
DAT marketing. While Sony started selling blank DAT cassettes
at $12 to $18 when it launched the home DAT unit, there are
still only about 30 prerecorded titles on the market. And at
about $25 a pop, they are pricier than compact disks.
   But "now that we've extended DAT, we believe there will be
strong consumer response," said Martin Homlish, president of
Sony's audio component systems division. "Then we believe you
will see additional movement in software {prerecorded
titles}."
   To drive home the idea that more titles will follow soon,
Sony said it reached a special promotional agreement with its
wholly owned CBS Records unit. CBS recently recorded four new
jazz titles, which consumers will receive free along with
their purchase of a DAT player from Oct. 1 until Jan. 31,
1991. Analysts have said Sony's ties to a major recording
company may help it to nudge the industry toward DAT.
   For Sony's rivals, the new DAT products are good news and
bad news. "From an industry point of view, it expands the
market and shows consumers it's not a fly-by-night product,"
says Paul Foschino, assistant general manager of Technics, an
audio division of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of
Japan. "But I wish we had done it first." Technics will start
selling home DAT players later this month.
   Other Japanese makers are expected to launch DAT players
by year end, though Japan's Pioneer Electronic Inc. says it's
not planning any DAT products in the U.S. soon.
