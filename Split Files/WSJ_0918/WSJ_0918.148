   WASHINGTON -- A Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
proposal to create an electronic library for municipal bond
disclosure documents is winning support from those who have
an interest in the municipal bond market.
   Out of more than 90 public-comment letters received so far
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, most favor the
plan to create a Municipal Securities Information Library
System.

   The comment period ends soon, and the SEC is expected to
consider the plan before year end, perhaps next month.
   "Access to information about securities and issuers has
been identified as a chronic problem for the market," said
Savannah, Ga., Finance Director Richard Evans, a proposal
supporter.
   The prospective library's costs "are more than offset by
the market efficiencies it will provide," said North Carolina
Treasurer Harlan Boyles.
   Another supporter, the Municipal Securities Committee of
the North American Securities Administrators Association,
said it would ultimately like to see the SEC and MSRB mandate
the filing of continuing updates by bond issuers.
   MSRB Chairman Thomas Sexton, managing director of First
Boston Corp., said: "The Board's primary purpose is similar
to the Commission's -- investor protection comes first." He
said "when investors do not have access to complete
information about municipal securities, the prices they pay
for these securities may not be the fair market value."
