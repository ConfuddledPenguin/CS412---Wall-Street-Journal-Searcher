   A group including CBS Inc.'s chief executive officer,
Laurence A. Tisch, raised its stake in Bank of Boston Corp.
to 9.9% and may seek Federal Reserve Board clearance to boost
the holding to as much as 14.9%.
   The purchase is the third within the last year. In
December, the group took a 6.6% stake in the bank holding
company, and said at the time that it might boost or cut the
holding. In August it lifted the stake to 8.9%.

was trading at about $18.
