   A federal judge in Portland, Ore., dealt regulators
another setback in their increasingly troubled effort to
enforce thrift reforms mandated by last year's savings and
loan bailout bill.
   As expected, Judge Owen Panner issued a permanent
injunction that bars regulators from nullifying capital
forebearances and other breaks regulators granted to
Portland-based Far West Federal Bank in 1988. The breaks
exempted the thrift from normal accounting and capital
standards and have enabled it to stay in business; without
those exemptions, Far West would have negative tangible
capital of $270 million, making it one of the most deeply
insolvent thrifts in the country.

   The bailout bill invalidated such forebearances and
accounting gimmicks and called for stricter accounting and
capital standards, in hopes of avoiding the kind of financial
legerdemain that helped swell the cost of the U.S. thrift
debacle to its present estimate of $500 billion. Regulators
informed Far West early this year that they would wipe out
the thrift's special treatment, instantly rendering it
insolvent. Far West sued in January to block that move.
   Judge Panner's latest ruling was his court's final say in
that lawsuit. It wasn't a surprise because it echoed his
previous rulings, in granting Far West temporary and
permanent restraining orders last spring, that federal
regulators could not renege on their previous promises of
forebearance.
   Nonetheless, the ruling underscores the intensifying legal
muddle surrounding the bailout. Earlier this month, a federal
judge in Kansas ruled that regulators did not have the right
to seize Franklin Savings Association of Ottawa, Kansas, an
unorthodox thrift that did little lending and focused instead
on complex investments in mortgage-backed securities and
hedging instruments. That judge ruled that regulators were
incompetent to understand Franklin's high-finance strategies
and ordered the thrift returned to the control of its
controversial chairman, Ernest Fleischer. However, the
government won a stay of that order while its appeal is
pending.
   In other cases, courts have held that regulators can
renege on capital forebearances similar to those granted Far
West. The legal twists and turns have stalled regulators'
efforts to overhaul the industry and eliminate practices that
in the past have led to huge losses.
   A spokesman for the Office of Thrift Supervision said it
would appeal Judge Panner's decision in the Far West case.
Ultimately, lawyers believe the Supreme Court will be asked
to determine what new powers regulators have under the thrift
bailout bill.
