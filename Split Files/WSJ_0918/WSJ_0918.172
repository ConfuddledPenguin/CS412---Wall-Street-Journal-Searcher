   LONDON -- Brent Walker Group PLC, a British leisure
concern, said it will ask Grand Metropolitan PLC to return
part of the #685 million ($1.3 billion) purchase price for
two betting shops.
   The claim stems from what Brent Walker says is
worse-than-expected profit performance by William Hill
Organization Ltd. and Mecca Bookmakers Ltd. Brent Walker
purchased the two companies, which are based in London, in
1989.

   Brent Walker didn't say how much of a rebate it would
request from Grand Met, except to say it would be
"substantial."
   The purchase agreement between the two companies called
for an adjustment to the purchase price if the combined
pretax profit of William Hill and Mecca fell below #51
million. Brent Walker said the combined pretax profit of the
shops was "substantially below" that figure, according to
accounts drafted by its auditors.
   A source familiar with the betting operations said that
Brent Walker may ask for an adjustment of as much as #166
million. But Grand Met said a review of the accounts by its
auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, and outside auditors,
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, shows that there is no need for
an adjustment to the purchase price.
   Grand Met also rejected Brent Walker's claim that Brent
Walker isn't liable to make a final #50 million payment, due
Sept. 25. A Grand Met spokesman said the payment is a
separate issue from any adjustment of the purchase price.
   Sources familiar with the two sides said discussions to
resolve the dispute are being arranged. If the companies fail
to resolve the dispute between them, they will turn to an
independent auditor.
