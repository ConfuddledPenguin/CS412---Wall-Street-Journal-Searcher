   ABBOTT PARK, Ill. -- Abbott Laboratories, filling posts

named Thomas R. Hodgson president and chief operating
officer, effective Oct. 1.
   Mr. Hodgson is currently executive vice president of
Abbott and president of Abbott International, a division.

   Abbott, a medical products company, said Mr. Hodgson, 48
years old, will be responsible for Abbott's operating
divisions, as well as corporate engineering, corporate
hospital marketing and TAP Pharmaceuticals, Abbott's joint
venture with Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. of Japan.
   Mr. Hodgson succeeds Jack W. Schuler, who resigned in
August 1989 citing "differences in philosophy" with Robert A.
Schoellhorn, then-chairman and chief executive officer. Mr.
Schuler's resignation was considered a forced departure.
   Earlier this year, the Abbott board ousted Mr. Schoellhorn
from his executive positions. After a fight with the company,
Mr. Schoellhorn, who had remained an employee of Abbott,
retired.
   Mr. Hodgson becomes Abbott's fourth chief operating
officer in 10 years. James Vincent and G. Kirk Rabb resigned
in 1980 and 1985, respectively, also citing differences with
Mr. Schoellhorn.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Abbott closed at $40.375, up 12.5 cents.
   J. Duncan McIntyre was named to succeed Mr. Hodgson as
president of Abbott International. Mr. McIntyre, who is
currently a vice president and responsible for European
operations at Abbott International, is also being promoted to
senior vice president of the parent company.
   Also, Abbott promoted to senior vice president the
following vice presidents: Paul N. Clark, pharmaceutical
operations; John C. Kane, Ross Products; John G. Kringel,
hospital products; Thomas M. McNally, chemical and
agricultural products; and David A. Thompson, diagnostic
operations.
