   Six banks are seeking an involuntary bankruptcy-court
liquidation of Colonial Realty Co., a closely held marketer
of more than $1 billion in real estate partnerships.
   Bankers said that Colonial, of West Hartford, Conn., is
being squeezed by the slumping real estate market and its
inability to obtain tenants on some of the properties owned
by the partnerships.

   The company's financial distress raises the prospect of
investment losses to the many individual investors in its
partnerships. It also poses risks to other creditors,
including banks that financed the partnerships and lent money
to Colonial and the individual partners.
   Fuhrman Nettles, an analyst who follows limited
partnerships for Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., in Shrewsbury,
N.J., said Stanger's hot line has been flooded by calls from
worried Colonial investors. Yesterday, Advest Group Inc. said
it had taken over management, with Colonial's consent, of two
troubled partnerships that Colonial marketed through Advest
in 1988 and 1989. The partnerships together had a value of
$17.5 million when they were issued.
   The six banks, including a unit of Bank of New England
Corp. and People's Bank of Bridgeport, Friday filed
involuntary bankruptcy petitions against Colonial, under
Chapter Seven of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The banks, which
acted in federal bankruptcy court in Hartford, also served
bankruptcy petitions against Jon Googel and Ben Sisti, two
founders and partners of Colonial, and against Frank Schuch,
another partner.
   Colonial, in a written statement, called the action a
"precipitous move" that "reflects the insecurity of some
lenders" during the real estate downturn. "While disappointed
in the way in which the banks have responded to Colonial's
attempt to restructure its financing, Colonial is optimistic
that a strategic plan will be developed that will result in
the viable continuity" of Colonial.
   Colonial's troubles follow several spectacular falls of
other real estate syndicators -- including VMS Realty
Partners, Integrated Resources Inc. and Southmark Corp. With
partnerships sold in units of between $25,000 and $250,000,
bankers estimated, Colonial has several thousand investors.
   Until recently, Colonial has been regarded as one of the
most successful partnership marketers. Its offerings included
pledges to the individual limited partners that Colonial, as
general partner, would guarantee minimum rates of return and
protect them against properties' operating losses.
   "They did a lot of cold-calling, a lot of hard sell," said
Larry Kay, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. "They were a
very aggressive outfit."
   Colonial partnerships' holdings include a number of office
buildings and apartment houses, concentrated mainly in
Connecticut but spread over 18 states. Among their properties
are One Financial Plaza and Constitution Plaza, in Hartford,
and the JFK Plaza Hotel, at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport. Colonial also holds, through a
non-syndicated partnership, a substantial stake in the
Hartford Whalers National Hockey League team.
   Signs of trouble began to emerge in July, bankers said,
when Colonial sent letters to many of its limited partners
informing them that distributions would no longer be made
quarterly, but annually. More recently, the banks and
Colonial entered debt renegotiations. After little headway
was made in these talks, some Connecticut banks moved to
attach the assets of Colonial and some of its partners,
several bankers said. The identity of those banks couldn't be
learned immediately.
   But the precipitating event, the bankers said, was a move
last week by Mr. Sisti and his family to purchase houses
totaling about $5 million in Florida. Because he is a partner
in Colonial, Mr. Sisti can be held personally liable for
Colonial debts. Florida law protects personal residences
against seizure in bankruptcy-law actions.
   Mr. Sisti, through his attorney, declined to comment on
the banks' assertion about Florida purchases.
   "We felt there was a danger of assets being dissipated,"
said Richard Lublin, an attorney for Mechanics Savings Bank,
Hartford, one of the filing banks. "We hope we can work this
out, and we don't want to . . . hurt the real estate
community. Our action freezes any major move and gives us an
opportunity to see what's going on."
   Mr. Lublin said Colonial was behind in payments on $1.2
million owed to Mechanics Savings. The total in debts claimed
by the banks was $42 million, with the biggest portion, $25.6
million, owed to the Bank of New England unit. The other
banks included a Bank of Boston Corp. unit in Connecticut;
Connecticut Savings Bank, New Haven; and a unit of Burritt
Interfinancial Bancorp., New Britain, Conn.
   Mr. Lublin said that Colonial's bank obligations were
substantially greater than the $42 million, but that other
banks that participated in the loan talks elected not to move
against the company now.
   Bank of New England stock closed yesterday at $1.75 a
share, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
