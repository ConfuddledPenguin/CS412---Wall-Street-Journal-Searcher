   NEW YORK -- The dollar lost ground against all major
currencies as dealers prepared for what many believe will be
bad news about the U.S. economy.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5480
marks, down from 1.5710 marks late Friday in New York. The
U.S. currency was also changing hands at 136.55 yen, down
from 136.95 yen.

   Sterling was quoted at $1.9410, up from $1.8930.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 137.18 yen, up from 137.00 yen at the close there Monday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5492
marks, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.5577 marks.
   Because the dollar market is by far the world's most
liquid, the dollar is often used as an intermediary in
non-dollar transactions. For instance, a trader seeking to
sell yen and buy marks will often sell his yen for dollars
and then sell the dollars for marks. When this kind of cross
activity dominates the foreign-exchange market, the dollar
usually ends the day with gains as big as its losses.
   But yesterday, the dollar dropped despite active
cross-trading. "There is no compelling reason to buy the
dollar," explained Abigail Cook, a corporate foreign-exchange
dealer for Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
   "The market is looking for bad news" for the U.S. economy,
said David Wilson, a New York vice president with
Girozentrale Vienna.
   Dollar bears received further encouragement in late New
York trading when U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford
gave his blessing to recent dollar declines by calling them
orderly and crediting them with helping to improve the U.S.
trade balance.
   "People are waiting for a lot of things to happen this
week before committing to more dollar bashing," said Joe
Sabbagh, chief currency and gold trader for European American
Capital Corp.
   Most important is the prospect of a federal deficit
reduction pact. While most market participants consider
deficit reduction a long-term benefit for the U.S. -- and, by
extension, the dollar -- they say it will hurt the dollar in
the short run. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
has promised lower interest rates following a credible budget
pact.
   With U.S. interest rates dependent on budget talks, U.S.
economic reports this week will be scrutinized for signs of
recession, rather than clues to Fed behavior. Yesterday's
report that business inventories rose by 0.7% in July, more
than the 0.4% rise expected, was dismissed because it covered
a period before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the jump in
oil prices.
   The same argument will be made about today's release of
the July merchandise trade balance. The deficit is estimated
to have widened to $7.6 billion from $5.07 billion in June.
   The August consumer price index is considered more
relevant. The overall index is expected to have risen 0.8%
from July, but analysts will strip away the food and energy
segment to see if higher oil prices have worked their way
into the general economy.
   In the most closely watched non-dollar rate, the mark rose
to 88.211 yen from 87.174 yen late Friday. Market watchers
said the flow of funds from Europe to Japan -- reflecting
Japanese investors attempts to dress up their books before
the Japanese first half ends Sept. 30 -- has slackened. This
opened an opportunity yesterday for profit-taking on long, or
overbought, yen positions.
   Technical resistance at 88.45 yen stopped the mark's rise.
   Meanwhile, sterling, which is considered a petrocurrency
because of Britain's North Sea oil fields, was helped by
higher oil prices. The benchmark crude-oil futures contract
on the New York Mercantile Exchange added $1.87 to $33.63 a
barrel, a record high.
   Also lending support were comments by British Chancellor
of the Exchequer John Major indicating he wouldn't
necessarily cut interest rates before taking the pound into
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   Meanwhile, as the market awaits the meeting of the Group
of Seven industrialized nations this weekend, the question of
official intervention to buy dollars is being discussed.
   Robert T. McGee, chief New York economist for Tokai Bank,
said: "Intervention may be necessary to buy some time until
foreign economies slow down and dollar investments can become
more attractive."
   The dollar ended European dealings mostly weaker, although
it rose modestly on profit-taking against the yen.
   The U.S. currency finished Asian trading mixed in trading
dominated by a technical recovery of European currencies
against the yen. The greenback was last quoted in Tokyo
Monday at 137.00 yen, above 136.52 yen late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $389.40 an ounce, up $4.30. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$393.20 an ounce.
