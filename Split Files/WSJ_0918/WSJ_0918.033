   A federal judge threw out a shareholder lawsuit accusing
Carl Icahn of extortion and racketeering in connection with
his 1986 agreement to sell back his stake in Viacom
International Inc. for a premium above market price.
   Judge Robert Patterson Jr. ruled that if Mr. Icahn
pressured Viacom into accepting the agreement in a so-called
greenmail arrangement, it was through hard bargaining rather
than illegal conduct. Under the agreement, Viacom paid Mr.
Icahn $230 million in return for his 16.95% stake and a
promise that he wouldn't buy any stock in the company for at
least 11 years.

   The lawsuit in federal court in New York was initiated by
shareholders of Viacom International, which has since
restructured. The company currently is a subsidiary of Viacom
Inc., a holding company formed after a 1987 leveraged
buy-out.
   "The law didn't entitle Viacom to a right to pursue its
business interests free of the problems and fears caused by
the threat of a takeover," said Judge Patterson in his
opinion. "Public corporations are subject to such threats on
a regular basis."
   Viacom had sought damages of $60.5 million, which was the
value of the premium the company paid for Mr. Icahn's stock
above the market price, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit
alleged that the broadcasting and entertainment company was
illegally coerced into agreeing to the buy-back. The
agreement was reached May 21, 1986, six days after Mr. Icahn
disclosed his stake.
   Dennis Block, an attorney for Mr. Icahn, said: "We are
very pleased. We thought the case had no merit and was
frivolous from the beginning." Although the lawsuit was begun
by shareholders, Viacom agreed to allow it to go forward
after the company's buy-out, Mr. Block said.
   A spokeswoman for Viacom said the company doesn't comment
on litigation.
   Judge Patterson said the agreement would have been
extortion only if Viacom had received nothing of value in
return for making the buy-back. In this case, the judge said,
what it got in return was Mr. Icahn's pledge not to buy
Viacom stock for 11 years, as well as the return of his 3.5
million shares. In disclosing his 16.95% stake, Mr. Icahn had
stated that he would be interested in acquiring the company.
   "Any intentional exploitation of fear by defendants was
only part of `hard-bargaining' in a deal which resulted in
plaintiff receiving a benefit to which it wasn't otherwise
entitled by law," the judge said in the opinion. He added
that Mr. Icahn and his companies "didn't obtain property from
(Viacom) to which they had no lawful claim."
   Mr. Block said Judge Patterson's decision appears to be
the first on whether a buy-back agreement could be used as
the basis for lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations law. The Viacom lawsuit claimed that
the agreement, which the suit called "a form of extortion
known as greenmail," constituted one the illegal acts needed
for establishing a pattern of racketeering under that law.
   Judge Patterson said previous cases have already
established that greenmail isn't "inherently unlawful."

   LAVENTHOL &amp; HORWATH is sued by its former public relations
specialist.
   Sid Cato, who said he was hired to help counteract adverse
publicity about the Philadelphia accounting firm, is now
generating some negative publicity of his own for Laventhol.
   Mr. Cato filed suit against the firm in state court in
Chicago late last week, alleging that the firm broke an
agreement he claims would have paid him more than $415,000
for his services. Mr. Cato is the editor and publisher of a
monthly publication called Sid Cato's Newsletter of Annual
Reports, which analyzes the annual reports that publicly held
companies send to their shareholders.
   According to the complaint, Mr. Cato was approached by the
firm last spring about providing public relations advice and
joined the Chicago office as communications vice president
June 11. Laventhol is one of the nation's largest accounting
firms with 425 partners in 51 offices.
   Mr. Cato said his mission was to help Laventhol recover
from a spate of bad publicity about the firm's recent
troubles, including employee defections and a lawsuit by
irate investors concerning Laventhol's work for a Houston
oil-drilling tax shelter called Terra Drill &amp; Heavy Oil. (The
suit was settled for $13.5 million.)
   Mr. Cato's suit alleges that after Mr. Cato's first day on
the job, Sheldon Epstein, head of the Chicago office, signed
a one-year written agreement with him. But a month later,
according to the suit, Mr. Epstein told him that Laventhol
partners in the Philadelphia office wouldn't approve a more
formal agreement drafted by Mr. Cato's lawyers.
   By then, Mr. Cato said, he had provided
communications-strategy sessions to Mr. Epstein, held
meetings with partners and created a video aimed at improving
employee morale.
   In dispute were contract terms involving compensation, a
pension plan and even Mr. Cato's title: Laventhol wanted to
name him communications director instead of vice president
for communications. Mr. Cato's lawyers alerted Laventhol that
the company had breached the agreement and Mr. Cato could no
longer continue working for Laventhol.
   Mr. Cato didn't return calls seeking comment. In a
prepared statement, a spokesman for Laventhol said Mr. Cato's
complaint is groundless. The spokesman said that Mr. Cato
should be compensated for his month or so of work, even
though he did so without a firm agreement on his pay and
refused remuneration several times. "Our position is that
there is no contractual arrangement and that Mr. Cato left on
his own accord," the spokesman said.
   The spokesman added: "We are optimistic that we will
prevail in this case -- despite Mr. Cato's attempts to
influence it through publicity."

   EMPLOYEE DRUG TESTS that use hair analysis survive court
challenge.
   In Minden, Nev., State Judge David Gamble upheld an
employee drug testing program at Harrah's Lake Tahoe casino
that includes both hair analysis and urinalysis, the more
common method of screening for illegal drugs. Hair analysis
is a relatively new process in the drug-testing field. The
Harrah's case is believed to be one of the first to question
its legality.
   "It just hasn't come up in the courts very much at all,"
said Victor Schachter, an attorney with Schachter, Kristoff,
Ross, Sprague &amp; Curiale in San Francisco.
   A group of Harrah's employees had sought an injunction
against the mandatory drug-testing policy, contending that it
represented an illegal invasion of their privacy. They also
argued that the hair-analysis tests were inaccurate and
unreliable. Harrah's is a unit of Promus Cos. of Memphis,
Tenn.
   Hair roots absorb drug residue from the bloodstream. The
residue remains embedded in the hair until it is cut and
discarded. Hair testing involves clipping some strands of
hair, dissolving them, then using a technique known as
radio-immunoassay to check for drugs. Psychemedics Corp., a
Santa Monica, Calif., testing laboratory, provides the hair
analysis for Harrah's and had joined the case in defense of
the policy.
   Under Harrah's program, employees have the option of being
screened for drugs through urinalysis or hair analysis. If
they test positive, the results must be confirmed by a widely
accepted chemical test known as gas chromatographic/mass
spectrometry. An employee can be fired if the positive
results are confirmed.
   Judge Gamble declared the company's overall approach to be
reasonable. However, he noted that hair analysis alone "has
not, at this stage, developed sufficiently to form a basis
for termination of current employees."

   IMELDA MARCOS'S co-defendant, Rodolfo Arambulo, was fined
$20,000 for his role in the alleged racketeering scheme
involving the former first lady of the Philippines. In March,
Mr. Arambulo pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to
commit mail fraud. He later testified against Mrs. Marcos,
who was acquitted. Judge John Keenan of federal court in
Manhattan ordered the fine but said he wouldn't impose a
prison sentence on Mr. Arambulo, a Filipino who is seeking
political asylum in the U.S. The former California Overseas
Bank officer was accused of helping conceal money that
allegedly was stolen from the Philippines and transferred to
the U.S. The Los Angeles bank also pleaded guilty to wire
fraud in the case.

   THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT withdrew its application to extend
a court order blocking publication of "By Way of Deception:
The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer" in Canada. The
book was written by Victor Ostrovsky, who claims he spent two
years as an agent in the Israeli intelligence service, the
Mossad. An Ontario court had barred publication pending a
hearing yesterday. Instead of pursuing the injunction, a
Canadian lawyer for the Israeli government said his client
would seek damages against Mr. Ostrovsky, co-author Claire
Hoy, and Stoddart Publishing Co. of Canada, the book's
Canadian publisher. Last week, a New York appellate court
overturned a publication ban in the U.S. against the book's
New York publishing house, St. Martin's Press.

   ALLIED-SIGNAL Corp. and Travelers Indemnity Co. settled
their dispute over who will pay for the cost of cleaning up
pollution at more than 250 sites owned by Allied. "This is
the first settlement of environmental liabilities of this
magnitude. Many thought cases of this size could not be
settled," said David Ichel of the New York law firm Simpson
Thacher &amp; Bartlett, a lawyer for the Travelers Corp. unit. A
spokesman for Allied said the terms of the settlement are
confidential. But as part of the agreement, the Morristown,
N.J., aerospace and automotive-products maker will withdraw
its appeal of a decision last June in which a federal judge
ruled there was no coverage under Traveler's policies for the
cleanup of two sites in Maryland. Allied also agreed to
dismiss Travelers from its New Jersey suit against 175 of its
other insurance carriers seeking coverage for damage caused
by pollution.

Department of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,
will head the new office, which is scheduled to open in
Warsaw in November. Altheimer &amp; Gray has been active in
Poland for more than 15 years and expects its client base to
include U.S. and other non-Polish companies involved in
manufacturing, real estate investment, telecommunications,
construction and hotels.
