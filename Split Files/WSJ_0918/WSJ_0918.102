   Eastman Kodak Co. plans to unveil today an electronic
photography system that transfers film images onto compact
disks and displays those images on television screens.
   The system, expected to be commercially available in 1992,
is Kodak's boldest foray into so-called hybrid imaging, which
combines traditional silver halide photography with
electronic technology. The Rochester, N.Y., photo and
information-systems giant hopes these new products will pump
up conventional picture-taking activity at a time of stagnant
sales in film and paper, where Kodak makes most of its money.

   Kodak says its photo CDs will be capable of holding up to
100 images. Photofinishers will be able to transfer 35-mm
negatives to these disks, at a cost to the consumer of about
$20 for 24 images. Kodak says the equipment needed to
transfer the negatives to disk will cost photofinishers about
$100,000 and will include a Kodak film scanner, which
converts each frame into digital information; a Sun
Microsystems Inc. computer workstation, which corrects for
color and density, and a disk writer that records the
information on a CD.
   To view the disks, consumers will need a photo-CD player,
jointly developed by Kodak and N.V. Philips of the
Netherlands. The player, which also will be able to play
standard audio CDs, will cost less than $500, Kodak says.
   Using a remote control unit, viewers will be able to zoom
and crop photos on their television screens. By digitizing
the negative in the photo-finishing process, the image can
also be corrected for exposure problems. Kodak says the
digitized images also can be used with personal computers,
and the company foresees wide commercial applications for the
disks in such areas as desktop publishing.
   But some industry observers question whether people really
want to look at photos on their television screen. They say
that the steady decline in sales of film for slides indicates
that many consumers prefer photos that they can physically
handle.
   Kodak, however, says its research indicates otherwise.
"People definitely want to watch pictures on TV," maintains
Stephen S. Stepnes, a manager in Kodak's consumer-imaging
division.
   Kodak isn't the first photo company to discover television
display. Five years ago Fuji Photo Film Co. introduced a
photosystems unit in which negatives are transferred onto
floppy disks and, using a special TV-photo player, displayed
on a television. The unit isn't available in the U.S.
   Consumers also can look at pictures on television screens
with video-still electronic cameras, but their high costs
have limited their popularity.
