   Cordless Phones Migrate
   From Pools to Offices

   WIRELESS telephone and data systems are about to invade
the office.
   Several North American and European communications makers
are readying systems for the corporate market that will
eliminate costly wiring and allow workers to keep in touch
when they are wandering around an office building or a
factory floor.
   The Federal Communications Commission has asked
manufacturers to submit ideas for office wireless systems,
including compatibility standards. The agency also has
approved many applications from start-up companies for
radio-based voice and data-transmission systems. Most of
these units will encode each signal to prevent overlapping
voices and use "spread spectrum" equipment to scatter the
signals over numerous frequencies, increasing system
capacity.
   Sweden's LM Ericsson has begun selling a phone system in
Europe that uses radio-frequency transmission to link tiny
phones that can fit in shirt pockets. Engineers at Northern
Telecom of Canada are working on several radio-based systems
that can be attached to conventional phone systems to add
wireless service.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, New York, created a stir
recently when it introduced a version of its Merlin
office-phone system with cordless handsets. Still, only a
handful of phones can work off a single AT&amp;T system, and the
base of each phone must be wired to the main switch. AT&amp;T
says its engineers are developing "hybrid" systems that will
appear in a couple of years that combine wired and radio
technology.
                                                                                                       

   CEOs Can Give Snoops
   An Earful of Static
                                                                                                       

   MOTOROLA is hoping to cash in on businesses' vulnerability
to high-tech crime with its secure telephone technology.
   The Schaumburg, Ill., company, which already sells phones
to the government that encrypt voice signals, has developed a
new unit to market the devices to businesses whose top
executives want to protect secret recipes or competitive
battle plans.
   Motorola's phone, called SECTEL, uses a microprocessor to
digitalize voice signals and turn them into a special code
that can only be decoded by a similar phone on the other end.
The chip also encodes data-communications signals when a
personal computer is plugged into the back of the phone. A
user pushes a special button on the phone that changes it
from a normal phone to a "secure" one. After that, an
eavesdropper would hear only static.
   Motorola has sold more than 85,000 secure phones to the
Pentagon and other government agencies, but the corporate
market for its $3,000-plus phone could prove tougher. Robert
Wade, product marketing manager for Motorola's Secure
Telecommunications Business unit, said test-marketing in San
Francisco and Dallas drew fewer than 30 inquiries from
potential customers last month.
                                                                                                       

   Freeway Dialers May Get
   A Lift From Chips Soon
                                                                                                       

   CELLULAR phone systems around the country are poised for a
much-needed capacity boost from digital technology in the
next couple of years. But will all the phones, old and new,
be able to talk to each other over the upgraded airwaves?
   AT&amp;T and San Diego-based Qualcomm are designing a set of
electronic chips that can be installed in cellular phone
systems to allow future digital phones, including
pocket-sized models, to communicate over networks that employ
two different kinds of digital-transmission technology.
   Dale Stone, department head of cellular system engineering
at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, says the chip set should allow
phones to switch automatically between "time-division
multiple access" networks and higher-capacity "code-division
multiple access" networks. Many industry experts believe that
CDMA equipment will be the basis for future systems that
accommodate tens of millions of pocket phones used by
pedestrians, while TDMA will be used to handle vehicle-based
cellular phones.
   The new chip set will get a big tryout in late 1991 when
AT&amp;T and Qualcomm install a network for pocket-phone calling
in Manhattan for Nynex's mobile communications unit.
                                                                                                       

   One Bin for Voice Mail,
   Electronic Mail and Faxes
                                                                                                       

   NOW that "Fax it to me" is firmly fixed in the corporate
lexicon, facsimile developers are seeking new uses for the
technology.
   A potentially huge market will be hybrid products that
bundle document-transmission technology with electronic-mail
and voice-mail systems, according to a report from Probe
Research Inc., a Cedar Knolls, N.J., firm that follows the
communications and computer markets.
   Probe expects 1991 to be the year when voice/fax products
begin to take off. By 1995, Probe predicts that 14% of all
voice-mail and voice-response systems, a $2 billion-plus
industry, will contain integrated fax equipment for storing
and retrieving "fax mail."
   One company, Brooktrout Technology, Wellesley, Mass.,
recently landed a patent for its method of blending the
technologies into a single system. It makes a voice/fax
system that the Weather Fax, Maynard, Mass., uses to turn
National Weather Service information into charts, which are
then faxed to a caller who punches in the command on a
pushbutton phone.
   SpectraFAX, Naples, Fla., makes similar voice/fax systems.
