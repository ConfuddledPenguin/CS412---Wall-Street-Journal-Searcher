   As the takeover-giddy 1980s fade, investors are again
showing respect for hard numbers like quarterly earnings.
   But those reported earnings numbers are becoming less and
less trustworthy, analysts say. The "quality" of reported
profits is falling, which means those earnings are really
weaker than they look.

   "One can make the statement unequivocally that the quality
of earnings has been declining since 1986-87," says Steven
Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. This has troubling implications for
investors, he says, "because the stock market hasn't
accommodated this deterioration yet."
   Quality of earnings measures how much the profits
companies publicly report diverge from their true operating
earnings. Low quality means the bottom line is padded with
paper gains -- such as the profit-fattening effect of
inflation on a company's reported inventory values, or gains
produced by "underdepreciation," when a company doesn't write
off plant and equipment as fast as their real value is
falling.
   Because a decline in quality means companies' reported
earnings are weaker and less sustainable than they appear, it
indicates likely trouble for future earnings -- whether or
not a recession arrives. If history is any guide, those
lower-quality earnings also will come home to roost in lower
stock prices, analysts say.
   "We have found that quality-adjusted earnings are much
more closely related to the behavior of stock prices than
reported earnings" over time, says Baruch Lev, an accounting
professor from the University of California at Berkeley. "A
deterioration in quality of earnings would suggest a
deterioration in stock prices in the future," he says.
   To make reported profits better reflect reality, analysts
factor in higher costs for replacing assets and inventories,
and adjust the bottom line for accounting nuances, such as
gaps between "cash" taxes paid and "book" taxes reported on
income statements.
   Today, quality-adjusted earnings suggest that stock prices
"are very high," says Susan Lakatos, an investment strategist
at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. For instance, she estimates that the
stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index are trading at 17.2
times her quality-adjusted earnings estimates for next year.
"That's higher than almost any time since the early 1970s,
and its very, very worrisome," she says.
   The quality of reported earnings has been dropping for
more than three years, and analysts say it probably will
continue to fall as higher oil prices translate into higher
inflation, which distorts inventory and asset values. But the
deterioration isn't as bad as it can get. For instance,
earnings quality in 1980 was very low -- with true profits
some 40% below reported profits, says Goldman's Mr. Einhorn.
   Speedier depreciation (ushered in by 1982 tax-law changes)
and falling inflation sent operating profits soaring over the
next several years, at the same time that reported profits
remained essentially flat. By 1986-87, quality-adjusted
profits were 50% higher than the reported numbers, Mr.
Einhorn estimates. "That explosion in quality-adjusted
earnings was one reason why the stock market did as well as
it did" in the 1982-87 period, he says.
   Since then, however, quality-adjusted profits have
deteriorated steadily to levels that he estimates are now 10%
below reported earnings. (Kidder's Ms. Lakatos calculates
that quality-adjusted profits are close to 25% below reported
profits today.)
   Moreover, almost all the factors that affect the integrity
of reported earnings "are negative now," says Norman Weinger,
a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. And that means the
drop in earnings quality is likely to continue. Consider:
                                                                                                       

   INFLATION, which hurts the quality of companies' earnings
by bloating the value of the plant, equipment and inventories
they report on their balance sheets. This cheapens the
quality of reported profits, especially for companies that
use "first-in-first-out," or FIFO, accounting methods -- and
that includes a heavy proportion of smaller firms, says Mr.
Lev.
                                                                                                       

   TAX CHANGES also are skewing the relationship between real
profits and the earnings companies report to the public. For
instance, reported earnings, which book taxes at the going
corporate rate, continue to reflect the benefits of the
lowering of tax rates to 34% this year from 46% prior to the
1986 tax law. This benefit hasn't helped true profits,
however. On the contrary, real corporate tax bills have
actually risen since the 1986 law, which sharply cut back
companies' ability to shelter income from taxes through
aggressive write-offs of assets. The sizable paper gains on
income statements have only tended to mask the real state of
affairs.
                                                                                                       

   ACCOUNTING STANDARDS will only worsen the tax discrepancy
between reported and real profits. New standards effective
last year require that part of the old deferred tax liability
(the one produced by speedy write-offs under the pre-1986 tax
law) be booked as a gain on company income statements. That's
because this liability was being calculated at a 46% tax rate
and now will be carried at a 34% rate. While this change
won't affect real profits one iota, the accounting change
alone will produce about $3 a share of paper profits for the
S&amp;P 500 stocks in 1989-91, estimates Kidder's Ms. Lakatos.
That equates to about 13% illusory profit growth in that
period.
                                                                                                       

   FOREIGN EXCHANGE gains resulting from the dollar's tumble
also raise questions about the quality of soon-to-be released
earnings reports for those U.S. firms with big foreign
operations. For example, American Family Corp., Gillette Co.,
American Brands Inc. and Colgate Palmolive Co. all derive
more than 60% of their sales from foreign operations,
according to Oppenheimer's Mr. Weinger. Investors should
"watch that they don't pay too much for currency-related
earnings," he says. "These earnings shouldn't carry a
humongous multiple because they're really a one-time gain
that could easily reverse itself."
                                                                                                       

   LEVERAGE, a big feature of the go-go 1980s, is likely to
return to haunt balance sheets in the 1990s, analysts say.
Rising debt can help boost earnings when business is booming,
as long as the return on that borrowed money exceeds the
interest costs to the company (which are, of course,
tax-deductible). But those interest payments can quickly
overwhelm profits when business slows. "More leverage on the
balance sheet suggests more volatile, and therefore riskier,
earnings," says John Silvia, vice president and financial
economist at Kemper Financial Services.
   The stock market already has punished many debt-laden
companies, including Bally Manufacturing Corp., Beverly
Enterprises, Marriott Corp., Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
and Time Warner Inc., because of worries about their interest
burden in a sluggish economy.
   Even without a business slowdown, the fillip that rising
leverage gave to profits in the 1980s won't reoccur. And a
reduction of debt levels through early repayments -- which
already is taking place at some companies such as Shoney's
Inc. and TW Holdings Inc. -- would actually tend to hinder
future profit growth, analysts say. "Deleveraging is a trend
that's destined to continue and which will drag corporate
profitability," says Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio
strategist at First Boston Corp.
                                                                                                       

   PENSION EXPENSES, once a boon to corporate earnings, could
become a negative in years to come. Rallying stock and bond
prices in the 1980s caused company pension funds to become
"overfunded" in relation to their long-term pension
liabilities -- which meant new contributions could be slashed
to almost nothing. However, "companies are no longer
overfunded because of the markets' decline," says Robert
Raiff, director of research at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc. If that trend persists, pension funding requirements are
likely to increase, which would eat into earnings in the
future, he says.
