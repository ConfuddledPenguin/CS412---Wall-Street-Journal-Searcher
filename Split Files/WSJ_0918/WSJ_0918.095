   Buffalo, N.Y. -- The 70 young men and women dressed in
shorts and sneakers, all tan as caramel, look like kids on
vacation, except that they're holding bugles and standing in
a semicircle on a school field. "Ten-hut," comes the command.
They stand ramrod straight and raise the bugles to their
chests. "Dress-center-dress." They move ever so slightly to
make a perfect arc in the grass.
   It's not the Army, but it's close. It's drum and bugle
corps, a passion that consumes tens of thousands of Americans
but is little known to anyone outside the world of marching
bands.

   But drum corps is not a marching band, as corps members
are quick to point out. A drum corps marches in a football
stadium, but not at halftime. Drum corps put on their own
shows, and perform only on silver bugles and assorted
percussion instruments. The music is more likely to be by
Duke Ellington or Camille Saint-Saens than John Philip Sousa,
and is specially scored in 11 1/2-minute arrangements.
Instead of a baton twirler, there's a whole team called a
color guard that spins huge colored flags and does grand
jetes across the AstroTurf. Drum corps has its roots in
marching band, but is more difficult, more demanding, and
infinitely more spectacular to watch.
   A T-shirt sold at the World Championships at Rich Stadium
here this summer took up the issue. "Why drum corps is better
than marching band," the shirt announced, and listed the
reasons, including "SPANDEX]" Spandex is used in the
tight-fitting uniforms of the color guard, usually young
women. Drum corps, in other words, is sexy and wild and fun.
   Or is it?
   Over on the playing field under the hot sun, the
rehearsing buglers of Star of Indiana, from Bloomington, play
no tunes. They blow silently in set rhythms, then play a
single "G" for a while, and eventually, work up to a
four-note scale -- over the course of 50 minutes. On the
track, 30 nubile women in bikini tops and short shorts twirl
purple-and-yellow banners as if they were no heavier than
dime-store pinwheels. Their male instructor chews them out.
"Laurie] Too parallel]" "Tara] You're slicing down to the
right]"
   It's one day before the world championships, and 20
bare-chested male drummers are repeating a single drill over
and over. They send out drumbeats like rifle shots and
scamper across the grass like Olympic crabs, forward,
backward and sideways.
   "If we don't play something right, we go over and over it
until it's right. Even if it's one note," says Shari
Spradling, a mellophone player. "They tell us to picture
something as perfect and then try to achieve it."
   Achieving perfection isn't easy. The top corps practice 10
hours a day, six and seven days a week all summer, on one 11
1/2-minute piece.
   Corps members, ages 14 to 21, pay $200 to $1,000 to spend
most of their summer vacation on the road, traveling to shows
sponsored by the competition, sleeping in buses and on gym
floors (girls on one side, boys on the other, couples head to
head along the invisible but definite dividing line). Star of
Indiana, like most of the top corps, has its own buses, a
semitrailer outfitted as a kitchen, and another semi to haul
equipment. Dining is alfresco around the school parking lot.
"I get homesick for normal life sometimes, like not to sit on
a street curb," admits the otherwise enthusiastic Ms.
Spradling, age 21.
   Drum corps, says Star of Indiana executive director Bob
Lendman, "is a combination army, circus and gypsy caravan."
It's also habit-forming; most of the teachers, drill
designers and support staff, both professional and volunteer,
have been spending their summers in drum corps since they
were teenagers.
   "It's a ridiculous activity," says Glen Crosby, percussion
instructor for the Santa Clara (Calif.) Vanguard. "Even a
professional sports team doesn't work this hard. Once you get
everything right -- the music and the drills -- you still
have the attitudes of the music you have to get across --
while people are running around the field."
   The tenor drummers, for instance, each carry five drums on
a harness and must learn to play perfectly in sync with the
others in their section while blocking out all other sounds,
because of the distortion caused by distance. Because
everybody's always on the move, the drummers have to watch
the conductor's beat and decide whether to come in on time,
early or late, depending on how far they are from the
conductor at a given moment. Meanwhile, they're moving at
tempos of as much as 200 beats per minute and trying to
convey the charged emotions of a gypsy girl, a guileless
toreador and a lovesick soldier. Santa Clara Vanguard's
musical selection was Bizet's "Carmen," which earned the
troupe sixth prize this year (in 1989 it came in first with
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera").
   The corps are judged on execution of the music and drills
as well as the quality of the show, musically and visually.
Three of the nine judges move around the field to get a
close-up view; the rest are up in the press box, where, as
every corps knows, the sound from 60-plus buglers aiming
point-blank and blowing with gale force tends to quicken a
listener's heartbeat and send a few shivers on a hot August
night.
   This wall of sound is particularly impressive when the
marchers break from the amoebalike shapes, the ellipses,
figure eights, wedges and squares that they've been drawing
on the field, and form a single horizontal line called a
company front. As the front moves forward, the crowd
invariably cheers. It's a thrilling, momentary union of sight
and sound.
   The company front is one of the few remaining military
traditions in an activity that began when World War I
veterans formed drum and bugle corps to perform in parades
and keep patriotism alive. The VFW, American Legion posts and
Catholic churches were the first sponsors, but by the '60s,
corps had become so active and expensive that, with patriotic
and church fervor on the wane, the sponsors pulled out. Many
corps disbanded, but hundreds kept themselves afloat with
all-out community fund drives. With the formation of Drum
Corps International, a nonprofit service organization, in
1971, the activity became more sophisticated and
standardized, but not necessarily more stable. While Santa
Clara Vanguard generates more than $1 million through its own
bingo hall, and Star of Indiana enjoys the sponsorship of
Cook Group Cos., the other corps still scramble to make the
minimum $200,000 to $300,000 necessary to put one of these
shows on the road.
   There are 450 or so corps in North America, of which 185
compete. Each corps tends to develop a personality. The
Velvet Knights from Anaheim are irreverent and very
California: They like to abandon the drill and run like
maniacs around the field, and twirl lawn chairs instead of
flags. The Cadets of Bergen County (N.J.), who took first
place this year with an all-Bernstein program, are known for
their superior marching abilities. The second-place Cavaliers
of Rosemont, Ill., are all-male and crisply regimental. The
Blue Coats from Canton, Ohio, always play jazz; the Phantom
Regiment from Rockford and Loves Park, Ill., prefers
classical music.
   This year Phantom put together a show of assorted
Saint-Saens, proving that there is truly nothing like the
sound of 96 musicians on soprano, mellophone, baritone,
euphonium and contrabass bugles, tenor and bass drums,
cymbals, timpani, xylophones, marimbas, bells and various
other percussion instruments delivering the Organ Symphony --
accompanied by shouts of "Kick it]" and "Dawg]"
