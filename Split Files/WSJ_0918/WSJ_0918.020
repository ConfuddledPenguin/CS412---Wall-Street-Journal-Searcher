   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. -- Hamptons Bancshares Inc. said it
temporarily suspended quarterly cash dividends while it is
boosting provisions for loan losses from real estate.
   The company paid 11 cents a share quarterly in the first
half. The suspension will save Hamptons Bancshares $93,360
this quarter.

   On July 16, the bank holding company reported a six-month
net loss of $593,000, or 70 cents a share. President John F.
Kidd said the company within the past month has taken several
steps, including limited layoffs, and elimination of bonuses,
certain benefits and payment of directors' fees. In the
second quarter, the company added $1.3 million to loan-loss
reserves, up from $120,000 a year earlier.
   Officials wouldn't speculate on the duration of the
dividend suspension, but said they would consider reinstating
the payout when the company's capital position shows a strong
positive trend.
   Hamptons Bancshares owns the Bank of the Hamptons,
Hamptons Mortgage Corp. Leasehampton Corp. and Appraisal
Center Inc. The company has $153 million in assets.
