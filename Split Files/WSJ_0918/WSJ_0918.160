   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. said it wouldn't
take sides in the computer industry rivalry over development
of the Unix operating system.
   Apple said it decided to join both Unix International and
the Open Software Foundation, groups that have been sparring
for more than two years over trying to turn the Unix
software, originally developed by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., into a computer-industry standard.

   The computer maker said the decision "bolsters Apple's
support of industry standards and ensures earliest access to
emerging Unix technologies."
   The Open Software Foundation, which includes International
Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., was
formed largely because of concern that AT&amp;T and Sun
Microsystems Inc., partners in Unix International, had too
much control over the Unix marketplace because they
controlled the development of the basic Unix software.
