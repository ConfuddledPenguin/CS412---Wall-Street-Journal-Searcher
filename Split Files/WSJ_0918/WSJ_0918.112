   Xicor Inc. said it is temporarily reducing work hours for
most employees by 10% to 25% until continuing sluggish orders
pick up.
   The Milpitas, Calif., semiconductor manufacturer, which
employs roughly 1,250 people, said the scaled-back hours
would continue until bookings improve "significantly." It
added that it eliminated 36 jobs as the result of
reorganizing certain operations and trimming nonessential
staff.

   Xicor also said that "unless bookings for quick turn
deliveries increase significantly in the near future, we will
not be able to attain profitability in 1990."
   The company had a net loss of $4.8 million, or 26 cents a
share, on revenue of $20.4 million, for the second quarter
ended June 17. It said it expects to report increased revenue
and a narrowing of losses for the third quarter ended Sept.
9.
