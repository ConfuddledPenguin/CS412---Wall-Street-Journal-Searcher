   TOKYO -- The president of AEG Westinghouse Transportation
Systems Inc. said he will urge the U.S. Congress to retaliate
for Kansai International Airport Co.'s "preposterous
decision" to award a ground-transportation contract to a
Japanese company.
   AEG Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, is a joint venture
of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which has a 20% stake, and
AEG AG of West Germany, which has 80%.

   Following a meeting at Kansai International headquarters
in Osaka, AEG Westinghouse President John R. Tucker said the
airport's effort to explain why it awarded the contract on
July 10 to the Japanese company only confirmed U.S.
suspicions of "irregularities" in the procurement process.
   Mr. Tucker said presentations at the meeting indicated
that important elements of the so-called people-mover system
proposed by Niigata Engineering Co. differ from the systems
Niigata has previously built. That, along with the fact that
Niigata has never installed an airport system, flies in the
face of previous assurances by Kansai International's
president that the airport would place a high priority on
proven equipment and proven reliability, Mr. Tucker charged.
   A spokesman for the airport and a Niigata executive
dismissed Mr. Tucker's allegations. They insisted that
Niigata won because its bid was competitive -- though not the
lowest of the 13 submitted -- and its proposed system well
suited to the airport's needs.
   People movers, also known as automated guideway transit
systems, are electric-powered, trainlike systems used to
shuttle passengers among airport terminals, between
mass-transit systems, and the like. Westinghouse has
installed 14 of the 18 airport systems in the world,
beginning with the Tampa, Fla., airport in 1970, according to
Mr. Tucker.
   Kansai International spokesman Nobuyuki Higuchi said
Niigata's bid was "in the same price range" as those of seven
other bidders, while AEG Westinghouse's was among the
highest. AEG Westinghouse and its three Japanese partners bid
just under eight billion yen (about $58 million), while
Niigata and its partner, Osaka-based Sumitomo Corp., bid
about five billion yen. A United Technologies Corp.
subsidiary that has won a people-mover contract for the next
phase of Tokyo's Narita International airport also was among
the unsuccessful bidders.
   Shinichi Ohno, head of Niigata's transportation-systems
business division, acknowledged that the number of car doors
and certain other features of the Kansai International system
differ from those Niigata has built to shuttle rail commuters
in Osaka and Yokohama. But he said the basic elements of the
Kansai International system closely resemble those in the
fully automated system the company has had in Osaka for 10
years.
