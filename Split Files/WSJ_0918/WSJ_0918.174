   NEW YORK -- The Newspaper Guild voted overwhelmingly to
accept New York Post owner Peter S. Kalikow's proposal of
wage-and-benefit cuts to keep the 189-year-old tabloid in
business.
   After a loud and emotional meeting that lasted for two
hours, Guild members, made up largely of editors, reporters
and advertising staff, voted 242-45 to approve concessions,
which call for a four-day workweek, a 20% cut in salary and
the elimination of dozens of jobs. Ten other newspaper unions
are expected to approve similar cuts.

   If the proposal had been rejected, Mr. Kalikow vowed to
shut down the paper with a final edition for today. Folding
the paper would have put 960 people out of work. Mr. Kalikow
has sought $27 million in cost cuts so the paper can break
even in 1990.
   Later this week, Mr. Kalikow and the unions are expected
to sign a new three-year contract. "Three years, for the Post
that's a long time," said Paul Tharp, a Post reporter after
emerging from the union hall in Manhattan.
   Though many union members said they were against cutting
their own pay and workweek, they were swayed by a last-minute
sweetener by Mr. Kalikow to boost severance pay for those who
agree to resign. At the Guild meeting, several members spoke
out saying they would approve the contract but they would
take the buyout. Mr. Kalikow has also promised the unions 20%
of the company's stock and a representative on the board.
   The settlement at the Post is expected to put pressure on
Tribune Co.'s Daily News, which is in the midst of stalled
and bitter negotiations with its unions. The Daily News,
however, is asking its unions for extensive changes in hiring
and operations, whereas Mr. Kalikow was looking only to cut
costs.
