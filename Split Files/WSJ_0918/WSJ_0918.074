   The last time we checked reports out of the summit enclave
at Andrews Air Force Base, the word was that the participants
felt they could, or should, or would strike a deal on the
"tax questions" by midnight. We ourselves didn't stay up last
night to see if a puff of white smoke went up from this
convocation of political shamans.
   In any event, much of the drama has gone out of the event,
at least to judge by one piece of "news analysis" we read
over the weekend. It reported that there were a few other
outstanding items, but, "If the tax questions could be
resolved, most participants agree, the other aspects would
fall into place."

   As for the other items that would fall into place in time
to avoid an October 1 budget sequester, the New York Times
analyst had a list: "The negotiators have not agreed on how
to make what both sides agree are necessary cuts in Medicare,
the medical insurance program for the elderly. They have not
decided which other domestic programs should be cut. And they
are far from concurring on the kinds of procedures that
should be written into the agreement to make sure it is
enforced."
   So whatever budget news the world wakes up to this
morning, the spending side of the negotiations is but a
sideshow to the main issue of how to raise taxes by $25
billion over five years. But we've always been fascinated by
sideshows, so before the mobs descend on the new taxes, we
don't think it would hurt if anyone old enough to attend an
R-rated movie slipped inside this tent to consider the
fleshpots of public spending that will remain open after this
secret session closes down.
   Federal spending is penciled in at about
$1,300,000,000,000 this fiscal year for the United States,
which somehow works out to a tad more congressionally
appropriated disbursals than the American people have been
able to support in tax payments out of their earned incomes.
Thus, obviously, the need for a "summit" to erect a tax
increase on an economy growing at 1%, give or take a few
unsold houses.
   Sounds to us a lot like a normal congressional agreement.
   Does anyone seriously believe that two months away from a
congressional election, this powwow is going to make real,
lasting, enforceable cuts in the federal bedrock? Of course
not. Or that this group of professional agreers will produce
real change in the way they concoct federal budgets? That
cause is left to the President, last seen calling for such
change into the dead air of the House chamber.
   Which leaves -- raising taxes. Here too, the negotiators
operate by rules unrelated to reality. A capital-gains tax
cut counts as a revenue loser, though it will gain revenues
at least initially, according to nearly everyone, if not
permanently, according to those of us who were right the last
time this particular issue came around. Yet the proposed
Business Roundtable Memorial Surtax, on net taxable incomes
above $500,000, counts as a revenue gainer -- though the
Roundtable members who lobbied for lower deficits have plenty
of lawyers and accountants to keep their incomes at $499,999.
This means the measure would lose much of the government's
current 28% of income beyond $500,000. And maybe the idea of
actually "buying" luxury goods is passe anyway, what with
innovations in leasing and the like.
   Ah, but we're already getting caught up in the spirit of
what will happen in the world outside Andrews, or Danny
Rostenkowski's committee room. The more responsible people
will be focusing on the Budget Summit, whose purpose is not
to accomplish anything discernible in the real world. The
purpose is to agree. Or more ideally, to agree to agree to
agree.
