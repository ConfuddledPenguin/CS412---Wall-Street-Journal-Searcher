   CSX Corp. said the Virginia Retirement System proposed an
exchange of a portion of CSX's RF&amp;P Corp. dividend
obligations for the stock of an RF&amp;P subsidiary that holds
the RF&amp;P railroad. The Virginia Retirement System also
proposed that it purchase CSX's remaining RF&amp;P dividend
obligations and its RF&amp;P voting shares at $35 a share. In
yesterday's edition, terms of the transaction were misstated.

   PRIME MOTOR INNS Inc. said bank lenders were considering
extending the maturity date of existing loans and allowing
the company to retain a part of proceeds from asset sales.
Yesterday's edition incorrectly said lenders had agreed to
the extension and to the sharing of proceeds.
