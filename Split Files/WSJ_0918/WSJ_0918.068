   CITY OF PHILADELPHIA -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered
its rating on Philadelphia's general obligation bonds from
triple-B-minus to triple-C, the lowest rating for bonds not
yet behind in payments. S&amp;P also lowered ratings on the bonds
of related city authorities and water, sewer, and airport
revenue bonds. Last week, the city dropped its plan to float
$375 million in short-term notes after Swiss Bank Corp.
withdrew a guarantee on part of the issue and investors
demanded higher interest rates. Without the note sale,
Philadelphia will run out of cash in November or December,
officials have said. In lowering its rating, S&amp;P said, "It is
now evident that without access to the market, the city will
not only be short of cash to meet routine day-to-day
operations but that its ability to completely meet debt
service . . . in the current year may be adversely affected."
S&amp;P said the city hasn't yet implemented last week's promise
to set aside enough money in escrowed accounts to guarantee
bond payments for the current fiscal year, which ends next
June 30. Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating on
Philadelphia's bonds last week.
