   There's a lot of bad news in the paper these days. But no
story ever shocked Tim Twardzik as much as the one that said
his product can kill you.
   Mr. Twardzik's family owns the country's largest maker of
pierogi, potato-and-cheese-filled pasta shells with East
European origins. In the small coal-mining town of
Shenandoah, Pa., the Twardziks annually chalk up sales of
over $13 million by producing 200 million pierogi.

   The 38-year-old business ran smoothly until two weeks ago.
That was when an Associated Press report claimed that pierogi
clog the arteries. Newspapers around the country -- including
several in Pennsylvania, the Twardziks' biggest market --
published the AP article. Cable News Network also picked it
up.
   The story couldn't have come at a worse time: In trying to
broaden the appeal of pierogi, the Twardziks have been
promoting them as a health food.
   For generations, pierogi lovers have sauteed the product
in butter and topped them with sour cream. Yet pierogi are
low in fat and high in the carbohydrates that athletes need,
the Twardziks' company, Ateeco Inc., says.
   Mr. Twardzik says he won't know for a few weeks, when
retailers place new orders, what effect all this will have on
sales. So far, the effect has been limited. Ateeco says some
pierogi-eating athletes called asking about the news reports.
Some grocery store managers told the company they are
wondering if sales will drop and a company broker in North
Carolina called to find out how he should handle any
inquiries from customers. Also, the company knows of one
customer who decided to shun the product. Through increased
store advertising and special promotions, the company is now
scrambling to head off any damage to the image of pierogi.
   These days, even a single news story challenging the
nutritional value of a company's sole product is enough to
make a business owner jittery. The impression created by the
publicity "is 360 degrees from what we were doing," says Mr.
Twardzik, vice president of the company. "People believe what
they read. If this catches on, it could really be damaging."
   The Twardziks and pierogi go back a long way. Mr.
Twardzik's grandmother, the daughter of Polish immigrants,
used to make pierogi and pass them around at picnics. Her
son, Ted, the company's chairman, liked them so much that he
decided at age 25 to mass produce them. They sell today in
the frozen-food section under the name Mrs. T's.
   When Tim Twardzik joined the family business in 1981 --
after earning a marketing degree at the University of Notre
Dame -- he was determined to expand Mrs. T's customer base,
largely Pennsylvanians of East European heritage. But it
wasn't until last year that the company's plan to put pierogi
on every dinner plate began to take shape.
   The breakthrough came with an unexpected call from Frank
Fedel, a nutritionist and member of a triathalon team
sponsored by Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital. Mr. Fedel said
Mrs. T's was a staple of the training diet of his team, which
competes in races that combine swimming, cycling and running.
Mr. Fedel said pierogi were a welcome alternative to pasta,
an endurance athlete's standard fare. For $500, Mr. Fedel
said, the team would wear the company's logo on its jerseys.
   The Twardziks started spending half of their $500,000
annual ad budget promoting the new idea. Mrs. T's became a
sponsor of the Bud Light U.S. Triathalon Series, where it
serves up all the pierogi that contestants can eat. For a
spokeswoman, the family signed up Paula Newby-Fraser, a
three-time winner in the women's category of Hawaii's
grueling Iron Man triathalon.
   Then, early this month, Tim Twardzik got a call from an
employee conveying disturbing news: "They told me," Mr.
Twardzik says, "that someone on TV was saying pierogies are
bad for you."
   Cable News Network had picked up an Associated Press
report about the Pittsburgh Community Health Challenge, an
attempt by the state and 100 local companies "to get people
in the Iron City to stop eating like steelworkers." In the
article's third paragraph were these fateful words:
"Organizers hope to turn people away from an artery-clogging
legacy of pierogies" -- which weren't mentioned by the
organizers -- and other "high-fat ethnic dishes."
   The Twardziks say less than 12% of the 60 calories in each
of Mrs. T's potato-and-cheese pierogi comes from fat. The
American Heart Association recommends restricting fat to 30%
of total calories.
   Charles Hanley, the AP's deputy managing editor in New
York, says he stands by the wire service's story. "Our story
really doesn't warrant any correction or clarification," he
says, "because pierogies are invariably prepared and eaten in
a way that makes them artery clogging."
   For Tim Twardzik, any hopes that the bad publicity would
pass without notice were dashed a few days later at a
restaurant trade show in Orlando, Fla. During dinner, Mr.
Twardzik struck up a conversation with a couple at a
neighboring table. When the conversation turned to pierogi,
Mr. Twardzik recalls, the woman replied: "Oh, I can't eat
those anymore. I read that they're bad for you."
   Facing a potential loss of customers, the Twardziks have
stepped up in-store advertising with placards proclaiming
that pierogi are good for you. They have inserted in Mrs. T's
boxes low-calorie recipes, such as pierogi with stir-fried
vegetables or "Mexican-style" pierogi topped with salsa and
yogurt.
   The nation's No. 1 producer of pierogi also is continuing
to strengthen its ties to endurance athletes in an effort to
reach weekend warriors as well. It recently was named the
Official Pierogi of the Chicago Marathon. Says Tim Twardzik
of the distinction: "There weren't a lot of people fighting
it out for that one."
