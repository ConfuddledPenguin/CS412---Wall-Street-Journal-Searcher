   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is seeking sweeping authority
to accept and disburse, without future congressional
approval, billions of dollars in aid from foreign governments
to help pay for the cost of U.S. troops in the Mideast.
   New legislation backed by the Defense Department is
proposed as part of a nearly $1.89 billion supplemental
appropriations bill sent to Congress by the Bush
administration. The measure, which must be rushed through
before the end of the current fiscal year which ends Sept.
30, would help cover initial costs of the operation and
carries a second provision sought by the State Department to
forgive Egypt's $6.7 billion military debt.

   Both issues face challenges in Congress, and new estimates
within the Congressional Budget Office indicate the cost of
canceling Egypt's debt will be more than $2.4 billion over
five years, or more than twice the $1 billion figure given by
the administration.
   Though it has received little attention so far, the
prospect of foreign governments financing a major portion of
a U.S. military operation poses unprecedented problems for
Congress, which relies on its control of the purse as a check
on the executive branch and its war-making authority.
   Both sides in the debate hope to avoid an outright
confrontation but, absent approval of the proposed
legislation, the Defense Department has signaled it may
invoke a little-known statute empowering the Treasury to
accept gifts for defense purposes. Adopted in 1954, the law
was designed to foster patriotism and to facilitate gifts
from American citizens, but no specific limitation exists to
bar its application to the current situation.
   "I would like updated legislation but the exisiting
legislation works," said Terrence O'Donnell, the Pentagon's
general counsel.
   Preliminary estimates by the Pentagon indicate foreign
donations could cover as much as $7 billion of the $15
billion in costs over the next year for the "Desert Shield"
operation.
   The new legislation, unlike the 1954 law, removes the
Treasury and General Services Administration from the process
and gives the Pentagon its own gift account through which
money could be moved without specific appropriation or
authorization by Congress.
   Mr. O'Donnell said expenditures would be reported to
lawmakers and subject to existing legislative limitations,
but Congress would clearly give up leverage it now enjoys
over spending.
   By a simple majority vote in both houses today, members
can withhold money as they did in the Vietnam War or the more
recent Nicaragua conflict. But in order to put any curb on
the use of foreign support for the present operation,
opposition lawmakers would have to be prepared to command
two-thirds majorities in both chambers to override a veto.
   Mr. O'Donnell said the monies, once allocated by the
Pentagon, would merge with existing appropriations accounts
for operations or personnel, for example, but would be exempt
from any across-the-board Gramm-Rudman cuts. The specific use
of the funds would be guided by the stated intentions of the
donor, he said. But lawmakers are concerned that this gives
broad discretion to the executive branch, which has the most
direct relationship and leverage over the foreign governments
and leaders involved.
   "Neither branch of government, the legislative or
executive, should be able to combine the power of the sword
and the power of the purse," said Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) in a warning last week.
"The founding fathers did not want that to happen because
that was the way kings operated."
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said,
"Serious concern exists about accountability of third-party
contributions to the government. In the case of contributions
in support of Desert Shield, the Congress intends to insure
full accountability and oversight over the expenditure on the
funds."
   The separate dispute over Egypt's military debt centers
less on the $6.7 billion in capital than on interest costs.
The new CBO estimates are significant as a measure of the
long-term impact on deficit projections, but the more
immediate impact may be to encourage other nations to seek
relief as well.
   The State Department has sought to blunt this pressure by
arguing that Egypt is a special case since the U.S. has no
chance of recovering the debt. As the cost estimates are
revised upwards, however, the result is that other countries
such as Turkey may argue for comparable consideration on
their military financing.
