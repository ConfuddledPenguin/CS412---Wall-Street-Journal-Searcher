   NEW YORK -- American Savings Bank said it recovered $15.6
million of a $25 million nonperforming construction loan on a
building in New York.
   The recovery settlement resulted from the recent sale of
the 46-story commercial and residential building under a
bankruptcy court auction. The bank was a major partner in a
$65 million construction loan with a consortium of banks that
was made in 1984. The loan became nonperforming in 1987.

   American Savings said the recovery amount was after
expenses related to liens, attorneys' fees, taxes and other
bankruptcy court fees. As a result, it will take an
additional loss of approximately $1.8 million on the loan,
which will be included in the third quarter.
