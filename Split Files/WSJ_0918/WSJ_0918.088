   NEW YORK -- The era of explosive growth in the number of
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. partners may soon be over.
   A Goldman partnership is one of Wall Street's most
prestigious positions, and the ranks of Goldman's partners
have nearly doubled in the past six years, to 128. But nearly
10% of Goldman's partners have chosen early retirement during
the past few weeks. And that could pave the way for Goldman
to name younger partners without further swelling the firm's
ranks, some specialists say.

   "The economics of the {securities} business are not what
they were," and Goldman doesn't "really want to dilute its
partnership income base that much," says Roy C. Smith, a
Goldman limited partner and professor of finance at New York
University Graduate School of Finance. Meanwhile, Goldman has
many qualified candidates for partnership this year, Mr.
Smith says, and it "has a great commitment to bringing its
people along."
   Officials at Goldman Sachs, the last of Wall Street's big
private investment banks, declined to comment until the
partnership selection process is completed early next month.
   New Goldman partnerships are granted every two years;
partners, in addition to receiving salaries and bonuses,
share in the ownership of Goldman and its profits.
   This year the competition inside Goldman is particularly
intense. That is because Goldman can't easily continue to
swell its partnership ranks; it had just 73 partners six
years ago. But the firm must appoint enough new partners to
avoid discouraging employees who aspire to a partnership in
what is likely to be a near-record year for the investment
bank.
   But nearly a dozen recent partnership retirements are
helping thin Goldman's ranks. The retirements, disclosed in
Investment Dealers' Digest, a trade publication, include
several high-profile partners, in addition to the previously
announced departure of John L. Weinberg, who retires as
senior partner and chairman Nov. 30.
   They include: Michael Armellino, director of research;
Eugene Atkinson, former head of Goldman's Tokyo office;
Robert Downey, head of municipal finance; Donald Gant, a
partner in the investment-banking department; Joel
Kirschbaum, partner in the capital markets group; Todd
Morgan, a partner in charge of New York individual and
institutional sales; John Oros and Peter Sachs, partners in
the mergers and acquisitions area and Dennis Suskind, head of
the metals desk at Goldman's J. Aron &amp; Co. unit. Senior
Goldman officials say at least two other partners will likely
step down in the next few weeks.
   There is no set quota for the number of new partners,
Goldman officials say. Current partners submit letters of
recommendation for potential candidates, and Goldman's
management committee winnows down the list, before giving the
final nod.
   Although the number of new partnerships is far from
certain, one thing is clear: Goldman is likely to increase
its number of women partners. The firm has only one, and it
has faced scrutiny of its treatment and promotion of women
employees following a highly publicized sexual harrassment
allegation against a former top Goldman partner.
   In a recent interview, Robert E. Rubin, Goldman's newly
named co-chairman, said that the firm "has a large number of
very attractive candidates" for partners, including women.
Mr. Rubin declined to comment yesterday.
   The big increase in the number of Goldman partners in
recent years means that the position doesn't hold quite as
much stature as it once did, some analysts say.
   "It's not as prestigious as it was 10 or 15 years ago,
when they didn't have more than 60 partners," says Perrin
Long, senior securities analyst at Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. "But it remains one of the most coveted
positions within the securities business."
