   Your Aug. 16 "Tracking Travel" article stated, "Airlines
have been doing a lot of howling recently about rising fuel
costs. But a look at those costs suggests they may not be
quite so bad." Rising jet-fuel costs are very bad for the
U.S. airline industry and I believe a few facts should
demonstrate that point clearly.
   Airline jet-fuel costs are essentially a fixed percentage
of per-barrel crude-oil prices. That percentage for the past
several years has held at 3.5%. Thus, before the recent
Middle Eastern crisis, crude oil at $18 a barrel brought
about 63 cents a gallon for jet fuel. If the current fuel
crisis places crude-oil prices at, say, $25 a barrel, U.S.
airlines will pay about 88 cents a gallon for fuel, a rise of
25 cents a gallon. These increases occur immediately; there
are no long-term price contracts anymore, not even 30-day
contracts. Every one-cent rise in jet fuel increases airline
expenses by $160 million annually. A rise of 25 cents raises
the jet-fuel costs $4 billion annually.

   I consider that quite bad, so bad that even as the
airlines raise their fares about 5.3%, which is not enough,
to try and recover these increased fuel costs, their
profitability outlook diminishes. It moves from an earlier
$500 million operating profit for 1990 to a $1 billion
operating loss.

   You state that travel-agent commissions account for 13% of
every travel dollar, basing this on a Runzheimer
International analysis of a New York-Los Angeles sample trip.
   The 13% is highly overstated. On domestic tickets,
airlines pay 9.26% commissions based on consumer cost (they
pay 10% of the base fare, which is less than consumer cost
because of an 8% tax). Car-rental companies pay only 5% on
most rentals, and even less on corporate rates. The standard
commission paid by U.S. hotels is 10%. In addition, it is
frequently difficult if not impossible to collect commissions
from hotel and car-rental companies.
   I know of no way to average 9.26, 5 and 10 and get 13. Did
the Runzheimer analysts learn the old "new math"?
