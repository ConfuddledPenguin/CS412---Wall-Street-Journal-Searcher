   Newmont Mining Corp., Denver, said it retained Potter
Warburg &amp; Co., of Melbourne, Australia, to advise the company
concerning its 24% stake in Newmont Australia Ltd.
   Newmont Mining sold a 19.99% stake in Newmont Australia to
Poseidon Gold Ltd. last month for $137.7 million, or $1.04 a
share. Newmont said at the time it would either sell its
remaining shares -- the 24% stake -- under a Poseidon Gold
offer or on the open market. Poseidon is offering to exchange
one of its shares for every two shares of Newmont Australia
it doesn't already own.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Newmont said it will wait to sell its shares until Newmont
Australia has evaluated the Poseidon offer.
