   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Gruner &amp; Jahr AG, which is
74.9%-owned by West German media group Bertelsmann AG, signed
an agreement with British publisher Robert Maxwell to take
over East Germany's largest newspaper and magazine publishing
group.
   The accord to acquire Berliner Verlag still must be
approved by an East German government commission responsible
for sales of assets formerly owned by the East German
Communist Party, a Gruner &amp; Jahr spokesman said.

   Under the transaction, Gruner &amp; Jahr and Mr. Maxwell would
each pay 50% of the takeover's cost. The spokesman declined
to give an exact amount but said the price was between 250
million and 300 million marks ($159.1 million to $191
million).
   In other German publishing-related developments,
Munich-based Burda G.m.b.H. said it is considering launching
a newspaper in East Germany, which will merge with West
Germany into a single nation Oct. 3. Burda said the East
Berlin-based newspaper will be part of a joint venture
between Burda Holding and News International, a unit of the
News Corp. media group operated by Australian publisher
Rupert Murdoch.
