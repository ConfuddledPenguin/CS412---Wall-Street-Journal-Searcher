   CHENEY FIRED the Air Force chief of staff for discussing
plans to bomb Iraq.
   In announcing the firing, the defense secretary said Gen.
Michael Dugan used "poor judgment" and disclosed classified
data. The general's comments, in which he publicly talked
about plans for bombing raids on Baghdad that would aim to
kill Saddam Hussein if war erupts, have been a major
embarrassment for Washington. Separately, Bush gave a mixed
review on the effectiveness of economic curbs against Iraq.
In Brussels, EC foreign ministers announced an expulsion of
Iraq's military personnel and set limits on the movements of
other Iraqi diplomats.

   GORBACHEV PROPOSED a referendum on private ownership of
land.
   Only days after the Soviet leader publicly endorsed
radical plans to establish a market economy starting Oct. 1,
he backpedaled and called for a national referendum on
decollectivization of agriculture -- something that could
take months to organize. Separately, other officials signaled
they would hinder introduction of the radical Shatalin plan
entailing swift economic deregulation, which they believe
will lead to the collapse of the central government and lower
living standards.
   The referendum would be the first to be held in the Soviet
Union. Gorbachev didn't indicate where he personally stood on
the land-ownership issue.
