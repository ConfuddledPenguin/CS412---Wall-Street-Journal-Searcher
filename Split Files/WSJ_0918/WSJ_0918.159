   The offer, which previously had been extended, was to have
expired last Friday.
   Kansas City P&amp;L said more than 13.5 million shares of
Kansas G&amp;E, along with 40,595 shares of its 4.5% preferred,
32,577 shares of 4.32% preferred and 24,406 shares of 4.28%
preferred have been tendered.
   "Kansas Gas &amp; Electric stockholders continue to send a
clear and positive signal concerning our offer," said Kansas
City P&amp;L President Drue Jennings in a statement.
   Last week, Kansas City G&amp;E disclosed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it was negotiating to
be acquired by a company other than Kansas City P&amp;L. It
refused to identify the company.
