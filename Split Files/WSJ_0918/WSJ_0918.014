   It Takes a Lot of Grit to Compete,
   And There's Always a Good Finish

   It's got the right stuff to go all the way in the sports
world: speed, difficulty and a hint of danger to thrill its
macho audience. On top of which, it puts a great finish on
oak.
   Belt-sander racing, a longtime underground activity for
vocational-education students and naughty carpenters, has
found a new following. Organized beltsander races have popped
up at the Triple R Bar in Bath, Maine, where aficionados can
cheer as machines zoom across specially designed tracks.

   However, questions arise about racing power tools. At
least one belt-sander maker calls the practice "inherently
unsafe." People in the carpentry field agree. "If the
students did this, I'd take care of them real quick," insists
Albert Konecink, a carpentry instructor at the Ranken
Technical College in Missouri.
   Despite the risks, fans of belt-sander racing -- many of
them carpenters -- revel in the sport. "Once somebody sees
it, it's contagious," says Karl Grose, co-owner of the Triple
R and one of six members of the National Belt Sander Racing
Association. "People go nuts when they see it happening. One
was clocked at 2.5 seconds for 40 feet. It surprises the hell
out of you."
   The races at the Triple R, a watering spot popular with
motorcyclists, began a couple of years ago when some bored
carpenters spied the flying belt sanders on "Bob Uecker's
Wacky World of Sports" TV show. Since then, the sport has
grown, attracting as many as 100 patrons and five to six
competitors to the Triple R's annual Spring Nationals, Winter
Nationals and Summer Nationals.
   Nationals? "The names give us something to say when we
advertise them," says Mr. Grose.
   Interest in the races is growing in Bath. The United
Bikers of Maine now races belt sanders at its meetings, and
the Triple R has formed a team to take on bikers in Augusta.
A local bottler of Budweiser has begun sponsoring the races
by providing ribbons and trophies. And the bar has even been
contacted by businesses interested in placing their names on
the race tracks.
   With competition heating up, some owners have modified
their belt sanders to control their direction, while others
have added devices to prevent their racers from backing up.
Several belt sanders sport painted themes -- one features a
small motorcycle mural. And some of the racers even have
names. "They're probably not printable," warns Mr. Grose.
