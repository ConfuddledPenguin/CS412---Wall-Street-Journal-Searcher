   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. will spend as much as $4
billion to sweeten a range of job and income security
programs under a new three-year contract reached with the
United Auto Workers union.
   The agreement, reached early yesterday after a 41-hour
weekend bargaining session, requires GM to boost the amount
of money it pays to employees who get laid off. UAW retirees
will get fatter pensions. Active workers will get 3% higher
base pay this year, and lump-sum payments in the next two
years.

   The pact places new restrictions on GM's ability to close
plants. But the agreement apparently doesn't require the auto
maker to find work for some 30,000 UAW-GM employees who lost
their jobs as the giant auto maker shrunk its U.S. operations
during the past three years. And the improved pension
benefits could encourage some of the roughly 20,000 workers
eligible to retire now to do so.
   "They're buying the right to downsize," said Scott Merlis,
an analyst with Morgan Stanley and Co.
   And while the estimated $4 billion cost of the job and
income security improvements looks high in absolute terms,
it's a relatively modest amount compared with GM's $126.9
billion in annual revenue. The auto giant spent more-about $5
billionjust for last year's retail car and truck sales
incentives in North America.
   Top UAW officials declined to disclose details of the pact
yesterday, but said they are pleased with the agreement.
   "I've been smiling broadly since about 3:30 this morning,"
UAW President Owen Bieber said yesterday. Members, he said,
"will be pleased with what they see" when the details are
presented at a meeting scheduled for this morning in Detroit.
The meeting is the first step in what could be a two-week
effort by the union's leadership to win ratification of the
contract by the rank and file.
   Company officials said they, too, were satisfied. "We
fashioned an agreement that will serve GM well, and will give
our employees more security," said Alfred S. Warren, GM's
vice president for labor relations. It isn't clear, however,
whether the pact will allow GM to make significant gains in
productivity to help its marginally profitable U.S. auto
operations better compete.
   According to sources in the UAW and the company, the
agreement includes these features:
   -- A 3% base wage increase for this year, and lump-sum
payments equal to 3% of employees' base wages in each of the
two following years. UAW members who are skilled tradesmen,
such as electricians and tool-and-die makers, will receive an
additional increase of 30 cents per hour.
   -- Increased supplemental unemployment benefits. Laid-off
GM workers with more than 10 years seniority could get up to
95% of their base pay for a maximum of three years instead of
the current two, local UAW officials said. Laid-off workers
with less than 10 years seniority could get 95% pay for a
full year, up from six months or less now.
   -- A boost in pension income to about $1,800 a month, up
12.5% from about $1,600 a month now. The pact also includes
an increase of about $630 in annual pension income for
current retirees.
   -- A limitation on the number of weeks that GM may
temporarily idle plants. How the limitation would work isn't
clear.
   -- A promise by GM to give the union a greater say in
decisions to move work out of GM plants to
non-UAW-represented operations.
   -- GM gets the union's blessing to seek three-shift
production, instead of the standard two shifts, at U.S.
factories. Three shift operations at GM plants in Europe have
helped to produce record profits, although it isn't clear
that GM could sell enough cars in the U.S. to warrant three
shifts at its American factories. GM also gets a new
absenteeism policy that company officials say will make it
easier to crack down on chronic work-skippers.
   The agreement may help GM improve its relationship with
the union, which has been strained over the past three years,
often over the issue of job security. The new leadership at
GM and the UAW may have helped.
   The contract was the first major test of new GM Chairman
Robert C. Stempel and so far, Mr. Stempel seems to have
emerged a winner. GM officials said they are encouraged by
the spirit of cooperation that grew during the talks. That
was symbolized by the union's decision not to call a strike
after the old contract expired Friday night. Instead, the
union extended its old pact on a day-to-day basis and
bargained around the clock to reach agreement at about 2 a.m.
Monday.
   Under Mr. Stempel, GM's negotiating team gave plant and
manufacturing group executives a greater role in the
bargaining process than in prior years. Mr. Stempel held an
important meeting with top UAW bargainers last week which
helped to move talks forward after they bogged down.
   These talks also were a test for Stephen P. Yokich, the
union's vice president of its GM department. Mr. Yokich,
whose reputation for striking companies had worried GM
officials, impressed GM executives with his "businesslike"
approach. Sources close to the talks say these negotiations
lacked the acrimony and emotional displays of prior talks.
   GM's stock closed at $37.125, down 37.5 cents, yesterday
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   UAW leaders are expected to approve the new accord after
today's meeting, but they will have to convince 310,000
active and laid-off UAW members to approve the contract.
   Because the negotiations dragged on until early Monday,
UAW leaders said they didn't have time to prepare documents
explaining the tentative agreement. Local leaders were told
to wait until this morning for full details of the pact. They
said yesterday that they were able to get only sketchy
outlines of the proposed contract.
   "It seems like it's okay," said Keith Campbell, president
of UAW Local 1999 in Oklahoma City, Okla. "I don't think it's
a bad agreement," he said. "I don't think it's a great
agreement."
   Following ratification, the union will press Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. to accept nearly identical terms. Mr.
Bieber declined to say which company the union will target
next, but it's widely expected that it will be Ford.
   Chrysler officials have insisted they can't afford to
match an agreement tailored to GM and Ford, both of which
have extensive, and highly profitable, operations in Europe
and overseas. "Chrysler doesn't have Europe to subsidize this
contract," said Mr. Merlis, the Morgan Stanley analyst.
   "We have our own set of concerns," R. S. Miller Jr.,
Chrysler's vice chairman, said last Friday. "We hope the
union will be responsive to them. There is no pattern today.
Going into the future, that has to be recognized."
