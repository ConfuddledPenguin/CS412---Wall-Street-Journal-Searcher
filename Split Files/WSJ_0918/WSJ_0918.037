   Crises seem to bring out the worst in people, especially
the "public interest" lobbies that always have a new proposal
to expand government. Environmental groups, which should be
on the defensive in the Persian Gulf crisis, having blocked
exploration of energy-rich lands on the outercontinental
shelf and in Alaska, are now supporting a bill introduced by
Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.) that raises the corporate
average fuel economy (CAFE) standard to 40 miles per gallon
by the year 2000. This measure would "have over 10 times the
oil-savings potential of any new domestic oil fields," argues
Christopher Flavin, a Worldwatch Institute vice-president.
The Bryan bill has already passed the Senate Commerce
committee.
   CAFE requires auto manufacturers to achieve a specified
average mileage, currently 27.5 mpg, for their entire fleets.
In effect, auto manufacturers must balance production of "gas
guzzlers" with smaller, more energy-efficient vehicles.

   So Mr. Flavin's argument sounds appealing -- until one
realizes that it means forcing manufacturers to make cars
that consumers don't want. Escalating gas prices during the
1970s encouraged Americans to buy smaller, more
fuel-efficient autos, but when gas prices fell in the 1980s,
many consumers shifted back to larger vehicles. After all,
energy is not an absolute value, but one that must be
balanced against comfort, convenience and safety.
   Yet, through CAFE, the government continued to tell car
makers to produce more small autos. Manufacturers avoided the
law's enormous fines only by using up credits "banked" when
CAFE was lower, cutting the production of big cars and
pricing small cars under cost. The result was to increase
large auto prices by as much as $1200, cut car sales and
profits and eliminate thousands of auto-worker jobs. (The
regulations also disproportionately hurt domestic firms,
which concentrated on the big car market.) All told, the
Federal Trade Commission figures that CAFE has cost the
economy about $4 for every gallon of gasoline saved.
   And CAFE almost certainly doesn't save as much gas as
predicted. Drivers, like all other human beings, respond to
incentives. Increasing the price of large cars encourages
consumers to hold onto older, less efficient autos longer;
subsidizing small cars will not only encourage people to
choose a smaller over a larger vehicle, but also to buy
another car for, say, a teenager, resulting in more driving.
Indeed, pushing people into more efficient cars is going to
make them more likely to drive more miles since they can
travel more cheaply.
   In the end, though, the most important reason to reject a
CAFE increase is that raising the level would kill thousands
of people. Car accidents are a daily event and the larger
vehicle usually wins: a person is four times as likely to
survive a two car collision in a 4,000 pound car than in a
2,000 pound car. Pulling people out of big cars and putting
them into small ones is going to increase the number of
traffic fatalities sharply.
   The exact size of the CAFE death toll remains a matter of
dispute. Early estimates ranged between 500 and 1,400 lives
annually. In 1988 Robert Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of Harvard released a
comprehensive study that found that CAFE had reduced the
average auto weight by 500 pounds, thereby upping traffic
fatalities by between 14% and 27%. That translates into an
extra 2,200 to 3,900 deaths and 11,000 to 19,500 other
injuries every year. "If you consider safety factors, CAFE is
a very costly social policy," says Sam Kazman of the
Competitive Enterprise Institute.
   How do environmentalists respond to the human carnage from
their policies? First, they refuse to acknowledge the
problem. Second, they say that the added auto deaths just
prove the need for more federal regulations, such as
government required airbags.
   CAFE never made sense, but at least when Congress first
passed the legislation in 1975 no one knew how expensive it
would be or how many lives it would risk. Today we know. CAFE
should be eliminated, not strengthened.
