   TORONTO -- The Canadian subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. said
it plans to make a new contract offer today that it hopes
will settle a three-day-old strike by almost 13,000 unionized
auto workers.
   Donald McKenzie, chief negotiator for Ford Canada, said
the two sides were "still a fair distance apart." He added,
however, that "now is the time to pick up the pace of
negotiations."

   The strike has closed nine Ford plants in Canada and has
threatened to curtail some of the company's key U.S.
operations that depend on parts manufactured north of the
border.
   Emerging from a brief meeting with union leaders, Mr.
McKenzie said the company was still drafting its new offer,
which will cover a range of economic issues, including wages
and cost-of-living allowances. Ford Canada officials wouldn't
elaborate on the specifics of the proposal.
   Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers
union, took a wait-and-see attitude to the company's
willingness to inject new momentum into the contract talks.
Mr. White warned, however, that the union was still prepared
to walk away from the bargaining table if there wasn't any
progress made toward reaching a contract settlement by the
end of the week.
   But Ford's Mr. McKenzie indicated that the company
expected movement from the union as well. "If there isn't
progress over the next couple of days, then obviously we've
got a major problem."
