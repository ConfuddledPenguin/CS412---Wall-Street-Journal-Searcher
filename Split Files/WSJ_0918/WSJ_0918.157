   Six months after its $18.50 a share, or $140.5 million,
offer for Justin Industries Inc. was rejected, a dissident
group holding 11.4% of Justin has made a second offer, this
one for $18 a share.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the dissident group, led by Perry H. Sutherland of Kansas
City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York, said that it
made the $18-a-share offer in a Sept. 14 letter to Justin's
board, requesting a response by tomorrow. If the offer is
rejected, the group said that it will consider other
strategies for acquiring the Fort Worth, Texas, company.

   The group attributed the 50-cents-a-share reduction in its
offer to Justin's planned acquisition of Tony Lama Co. for
$18 million, or $9 a share, plus the assumption of about $34
million of debt. The group contended that the acquisition of
Tony Lama, which lost $1.8 million in 1989, would lower the
value of Justin. Although the dissidents are seeking to block
the acquisition in court, they said the $18-a-share offer
assumes the acquisition will go through.
   John Justin, Justin chairman and the holder of about 20%
of its shares, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
