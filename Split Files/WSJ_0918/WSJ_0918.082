   MILAN, Italy -- Tire and cable group Pirelli S.p.A.
proposed to Continental AG of West Germany that they merge
their tire businesses to challenge the dominance of the three
giants in the world market.
   Under the Pirelli proposal, which would be the latest in a
series of combinations among major tire makers, the Italian
company would take a controlling interest in the merged
company. Pirelli-Continental would have annual tire sales of
about 10 trillion lire ($8.6 billion) and a 16% share of the
world market.

   In Hannover, West Germany, Continental said it needed time
to study the Pirelli proposal, which it received Saturday.
   Analysts said Continental's management, which has erected
elaborate anti-takeover defenses and has become locked in
battle with its own minority shareholders over voting rights,
could resist Pirelli's move or make a counterproposal.
Hostile takeovers are all but unknown in West Germany, where
close links and cross-shareholdings between companies and
large banks have been used to repel unwelcome raiders.
   Moreover, the West German company can fall back on a 5%
limitation on shareholders' voting rights adopted in 1984 if
Pirelli, which says it already has 5% of the stock, opts to
push ahead with more open-market purchases of Continental's
widely distributed shares.
   A Pirelli spokesman said its proposal has the support of a
group of holders owning a majority stake in Continental. But
he gave no financial details of how the merger might be
accomplished.
   Continental's current 8.7 million shares outstanding give
the West German group an indicated market value of 2.3
billion marks ($1.46 billion). At the end of 1989,
Continental said it had 47,000 shareholders and that no
single stake then exceeded 1.5%.
   Continental and Pirelli are respectively the world's
fourth and fifth largest tire manufacturers. But with about
8% of the world market each, they trail well behind the
leaders, Groupe Michelin of France, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber
Co., Akron, Ohio, and Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, which have
market shares ranging from 16% to 23%. Michelin owns
Akron-based Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., and Bridgestone owns
Chicago-based Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., leaving Goodyear
the only major U.S. tire maker that is still independent.
   Continental is the parent company of General Tire &amp; Rubber
Co., Akron, among its other holdings.
   Pirelli spun off its tire-making activities into a Dutch
holding company, Pirelli Tyre Holding N.V., last year, and
the group has been seeking to boost market share through
foreign acquisitions or alliances.
   Pirelli expressed interest in acquiring Firestone in 1988
but was beaten out by Bridgestone. In the same year, it
bought Armstrong Tire Co.
   In making its Continental proposal, Pirelli has in its
favor the growing disaffection among Continental shareholders
about the company's anti-takeover defenses. During a stormy
annual meeting in June, a shareholder motion to abolish the
5% voting limitation fell just short of the three-quarters
vote required to amend the corporate bylaws.
   Active buying of Continental shares in recent weeks has
supported the stock price. But a senior figure involved in
the merger proposal denied that Pirelli or its advisers had
been connected with any arbitrage activity. "This is an
industrial transaction, and we have had absolutely nothing to
do with speculative investors," said Michael Treichl,
managing director of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill
Lynch, which is acting as financial adviser to Pirelli and
owns some Continental stock.
   News of the proposal initially caused confusion as to who
wanted to acquire whom. Continental's stock plummeted 7.1% on
the Frankfurt stock exchange, closing at 265 marks a share,
partly because Pirelli's initial announcement made it sound
as if Continental was to purchase the Italian company. In
Milan, Pirelli's announcement failed to support its share
price amid a general stock decline. Pirelli fell 26 lire to
close at 1,785 lire a share.
   The merger proposal comes amid an industry downturn and a
price war. Groupe Michelin sharply cut prices on tires
shipped to auto makers in an effort to gain share. That
caused Continental and Goodyear to follow suit, injuring
their profits. Just this month, Goodyear announced plans for
layoffs in Europe, and Continental reported a 39% drop in
pretax profit for the first half. Pirelli Tyre, too, has
warned of lower first-half earnings.
