   Oracle Systems Corp. laid off 10% of its domestic work
force and made major changes at the management level, in an
attempt to recoup from its expected first quarterly loss
ever.
   About 400 people were fired Monday, effective immediately,
and four top executives resigned, were shorn of their titles
or took a leave of absence. The cuts are likely to save the
company at least $24 million a year, analysts estimated. The
company declined to comment on the cost savings.

   Oracle cut two levels of its five-layer sales hierarchy,
folded Oracle USA's finance and administration group into its
corporate finance and administration division, and
consolidated its various international organizations into a
single division. Michael Musson, investor relations manager,
said the company does not anticipate any more cuts and will
not comment on specifics until it releases its financial
results Sept. 25.
   Following the shakeout, the senior vice president of the
intercontinental organization, Peter R. Tierney, departed.
Oracle USA Chief Financial Officer Atam Lalchandani also
resigned, although people within the company said he is
leaving for personal reasons unrelated to the restructuring.
   In addition, Tom Siebel, Oracle USA's vice president and
general manager of direct marketing, took a one-year leave of
absence as a result of the reorganization, the company
confirmed. And, as previously announced, the president of
Oracle USA, Gary Kennedy, stepped down as president of Oracle
USA. He is still chairman of Oracle Complex Systems, a
subsidiary dealing with systems integration.
   The software company has been under pressure to make hefty
cost reductions ever since it reported in early September
that it would post a loss of about $27.4 million or 20 cents
a share for the first quarter ended Aug. 31.
   The company's stock was battered in over-the-counter
trading yesterday, closing at $6.875, down 62.5 cents.
