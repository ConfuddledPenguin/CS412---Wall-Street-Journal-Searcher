   Emerson indefinitely postponed its annual meeting,
originally scheduled for Sept. 24, to revise the proxy
materials and allow shareholders to vote on the transaction.
   Under terms of the venture, Fidenas Investment would add
two members to Emerson Radio's board, bringing the board to a
total of eight directors.
   Emerson, which sells personal computers and consumer
electronics in what has been a competitive U.S. market, will
compete in Europe with such companies as N.V. Philips and
Thomson S.A.
   Fidenas Investment, incorporated in the Bahamas, is one of
a number of firms under the umbrella of Fidenas Group. The
group has interests in banking and management consulting.
