   SAN FRANCISCO -- Classified Financial Corp. said
shareholders approved a previously announced plan to merge
the company into its majority-owned subsidiary, Rathbone,
King &amp; Seeley Inc.
   The company said that under the merger, which it expects
to complete by Sept. 30, Classified Financial shareholders
will receive pro rata shares of Classified's net cash and
common stock of Rathbone held by Classified. The merger will
not, however, affect Rathbone's stock.
