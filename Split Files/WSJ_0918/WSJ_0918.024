   ZURICH -- Chemical Banking Corp. is closing its Geneva
unit due to insufficient profitability.
   Chemical was one of the most active market-makers in Swiss
franc bonds but high local interest rates and the collapse of
the Tokyo stock market have made the bank's activities in the
Swiss market harder to justify. With Chemical's departure,
the so-called "grey market" loses a key player.

   The decision to close down the operation was part of the
U.S. banking group's strategy to "focus only on activities
where maximum profitability can be achieved," says Francois
Larsen, director of the Geneva unit, called Chemical N.Y.
Capital Market Corp.
   At the same time, Chemical announced the closure of
Chemical Securities Co. in Tokyo, which concentrated on the
marketing and trading of Japanese equities and equity-linked
bonds and was under the direction of the Geneva office. The
Tokyo unit has a Japanese securities license.
   Mr. Larsen says the Geneva operations had been "sometimes
profitable, sometimes not" in the past year as increased
volatility of financial markets, especially in Tokyo, made
business more difficult.
   He also says the capital market's group found it
increasingly difficult to market its services after selling
its Geneva private banking subsidiary in November 1988 to the
French financial firm Dumenil-Leble S.A., Mr. Larsen said.
   "Institutional and private banking is the essence of
business in Switzerland," Mr. Larsen says. "It's very
difficult to deal in securities without the backing of
captive customers."
   Chemical is also closing its foreign exchange and money
market operations in Geneva, leaving a seven-person cash
management branch office of the New York-based bank in Zurich
as its sole Swiss presence.
   The 55 Geneva-based employees, including 15 traders and
salesmen, will be dismissed after clearing operations are
complete, probably in the next three months. Trading formally
ended yesterday. The Tokyo unit's approximately 30 employees
will be relocated elsewhere in Chemical's Japan operations,
Mr. Larsen says.
   Patrick Voegeli, head trader at the bank, says two factors
hurt profitability most in the past year: high short-term
Swiss interest rates, which made it very expensive to finance
bond positions, and sharp drops on the Tokyo stock exchange,
which made Swiss investors reluctant to trade Japanese
equity-linked instruments.
   New issuance of Japanese equity-linked paper is down by
almost 50% in the first eight months of the year compared
with the same period in 1989.
