   Citing weakness in the stock market, King World
Productions Inc. withdrew its proposed $36 million public
offering for Merlin Program Capital Inc.
   New York-based King World, a syndicator of television
shows, filed the Merlin offering with the Securities and
Exchange Commission two months ago. Its plan was to set up
Merlin as a fund to expand production. Each investment unit
was to include one share in Merlin, priced at $16 a share,
plus a warrant to purchase a common share of King World in
several years at a price set now.

   However, as the stock market has declined in recent weeks,
King World's stock has fallen about 15%, closing yesterday at
$21.50 a share. The warrants would have been priced at about
a 30% premium to the current stock price, said Jeffrey
Epstein, chief financial officer of King World. "We don't
want to dilute current shareholders by issuing equity at
these prices," he said.
   The withdrawal of the offering won't constrain King
World's ability to develop new television shows, said Mr.
Epstein.
