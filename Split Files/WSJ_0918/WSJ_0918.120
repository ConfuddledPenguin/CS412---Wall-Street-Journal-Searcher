   NEW YORK -- In another high-level management change at
First Boston Corp., Curtis R. Welling was forced out as head
of the big securities firm's 450-person equity department.
   Mr. Welling, a 41-year-old managing director, was
succeeded by James G. Gantsoudes, 48, who had headed a
smaller equity group at Travelers Corp.'s Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
securities unit for the past 5 1/2 years. Mr. Gantsoudes is a
former associate of Archibald Cox Jr., First Boston's newly
installed president and chief executive officer.

   As head of equity operations, Mr. Welling was in charge of
First Boston's sales, trading and research of North American
stocks. He got his job only 15 months ago, after his
predecessor, Luiz Mendez, who helped build First Boston's
equity department into a powerhouse in the 1980s, was forced
out in a power struggle.
   First Boston, a unit of CS First Boston Inc., has
continued to undergo wrenching management changes amid a
severe downturn in its profits. In January, CS First Boston
Chief Executive John Hennessy demoted William Mayer and
assumed his duties as head of the First Boston unit. This
month, Mr. Cox took over those duties from Mr. Hennessy, who
remains head of the CS First Boston parent.
   The Gantsoudes appointment is the first major personnel
move made by Mr. Cox in his new job.
   First Boston said that Mr. Welling resigned "to pursue
other interests." In an interview, Mr. Cox called Mr.
Gantsoudes "one of the best people you could get." He noted
Mr. Gantsoudes's experience at Dillon Read and before that as
head of stocks sales and trading at American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and at Mr. Cox's former firm,
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. "He's done everything he's been put
in charge of very well," Mr. Cox said.
   Reached at his office late yesterday, Mr. Welling said he
resigned "on my own," even though he had no plans for a new
job. He declined to comment further.
   People close to First Boston said Mr. Welling was forced
out after it was determined he wasn't First Boston's choice
to lead the equity department in coming years. CS First
Boston officials privately have groused that the firm,
despite its strong presence in New York, London and Tokyo,
has done a poor job in coordinating its international stock
business. They say the firm hasn't made full use of its
farflung global operations. Mr. Cox declined to comment on
the issue.
   CS First Boston is 44.5%-owned by the parent company of
Swiss bank Credit Suisse.
   John Birkelund, chairman of Dillon Read, said Mr.
Gantsoudes left his firm on good terms. "He's a nice man and
we're sorry to lose him," Mr. Birkelund said. "He's going
over to First Boston to head a much larger equity unit. He's
worked with Cox before." He said Dillon Read will attempt "an
internal solution" to replacing Mr. Gantsoudes before seeking
outside candidates.
   Mr. Gantsoudes is a graduate of West Point and Harvard
Business School.
