   FRENCH BANK UNDER ATTACK

   France's largest bank, Credit Agricole, could be the
latest victim of the squabbling between farmers and the
French government.
   The Socialist government has been stung by the farmers'
demands for more money to face up to a second consecutive
year of drought as well as falling beef and mutton prices.
Last week, Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy warned Credit
Agricole to do more for the farmers or run the risk of losing
up to 20 billion francs ($3.8 billion) in notaries' deposits.
   The argument is more political than financial. When the
Caisse Nationale du Credit Agricole was privatized in 1987 by
the previous right-wing administration, it was allowed to
keep the right to pay a nominal 1% interest on deposits by
rural notaries, who handle all property transactions and
wills in France.
   A Credit Agricole official defended the bank by noting
recent measures taken to cut the debt burden for the
worst-hit farmers that will cost about 200 million francs.
                                                                                                       

   THE RIGHTS OF MIGRANT WORKERS
                                                                                                       

   The international community should protect the human
rights of millions of migrant workers, even illegal migrants,
and their families, a draft United Nations report recommends.
The report, quoted by a Japanese news service, cites a lack
of sufficient recognition of migrant workers' rights and
urges "appropriate international protection" for the workers;
included in that protection would be access to social
security and medical services in each host country.
                                                                                                       

   ASIA'S DEPENDENCE ON OIL

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait underscores the need of Asian
nations to diversify their energy needs away from oil, Datuk
Sulaiman Haji Daud, Malaysia's minister in charge of oil,
said. Addressing the Asia-Pacific Petroleum Conference in
Singapore, Mr. Sulaiman noted that Iraq and Kuwait account
for over 10% of Japan's oil imports. While "only a protracted
crisis can cause serious concern with respect to oil
availability," he said, the situation underscores the need to
move away from overdependence on oil.
                                                                                                       

   BICYCLES FOR CUBA
                                                                                                       

   Cuba has bought 200,000 bicycles and is negotiating the
purchase of half a million more to help the country face its
severe energy crisis, the official newspaper Granma quoted
President Fidel Castro as saying. Granma reported that
President Castro said the government was also studying the
possibility of building three bicycle factories in Cuba. Mr.
Castro did not say where the imported bicycles would come
from, but diplomats said they understood they would be from
China.
                                                                                                       

   BARTER AGREEMENT
                                                                                                       

   South Korea and Taiwan agreed to continue barter trade of
Korean apples and pears in exchange for bananas from Taiwan.
The barter trade in fruits will continue even after South
Korea opens its banana market to foreign companies beginning
next year, said officials at South Korea's Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestries and Fisheries. Under the agreement,
South Korea will ship 5,500 tons of apples and 2,800 tons of
pears to Taiwan next year in return for 26,000 tons of
bananas, the same as this year.
                                                                                                       

   U.N. ENVIRONMENTAL FUND
                                                                                                       

   Three United Nations agencies proposed a $1 billion
environmental fund for developing nations in Latin America,
Africa and Asia. Agencies involved are the World Bank, the
U.N. Development Program and the U.N. Environmental Program.
The three said they agreed to create a Global Environmental
Facility to ensure "that their development programs are
undertaken in a manner which protects the global
environment."
                                                                                                       

   POLAND'S PRIESTS
                                                                                                       

   While the Roman Catholic Church generally faces a chronic
shortage of priests, the number in Poland rose from 20,234 in
1980 to 24,678 in 1989, according to the Polish Episcopate
Office.
   That works out to one priest for 1,280 church members,
compared with 1,650 members per priest in the U.S. Other
countries with net increases in recent years: Burundi,
Rwanda, Zaire and India.
   Church officials give many reasons young men are attracted
to the priesthood in Poland. One is a desire to follow the
path of the Polish pope, John Paul II. Then there is the fact
that the priesthood offers prestige, secure housing and a
chance to travel.
   Some Catholic leaders fear growing Western influence will
deter young men from the priesthood. "More and more of
today's youth is intellectually weak," said an official of a
religious order, who blamed, among other things, "thoughtless
television shows" and "bad videos."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Nicaragua has deployed machine-gun-toting police to
enforce a government ban on hunting of sea-turtle eggs at
Pacific coast beaches. Eggs from the turtles, which are among
the world's endangered species, are a delicacy considered by
some to be an aphrodisiac. . . . A survey of 11,402 Japanese
companies showed that those anticipating a business pickup
between October and next March outnumbered those foreseeing a
decline, the Japanese Finance Ministry said. But ministry
officials pointed out that the impact of the Middle East
crisis may not have been fully reflected in the survey, which
was conducted in mid-August.
