   WASHINGTON -- The finance ministers and central bank
governors of the Group of Seven industrialized countries are
set to meet here Saturday to discuss the impact of higher oil
prices, recent interest rate rises, and the decline in the
U.S. dollar.
   "We're very concerned there should be a continuation of
growth," David Mulford, Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs, told reporters in a briefing
yesterday. The U.S. isn't facing a recession, Mr. Mulford
said, but he added that recent oil price rises would damp
growth in the G-7 countries: the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada.

   He said the decline in the dollar has been "orderly" and
indicated it wasn't a matter of concern to the Treasury. The
decline should help narrow the U.S.'s trade deficit, he said.
   The Treasury official also mentioned that the G-7 would
discuss the need to contain inflation but declined to rank
that priority against the need to maintain growth.
   The G-7 meeting occurs just prior to the annual meetings
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which
are set to begin a week from today. Mr. Mulford indicated
that the G-7 and the IMF and World Bank meetings also are
expected to focus on increasing the resources that are
available to developing countries hard hit by oil price
rises.
   That might be done by increasing the World Bank's
adjustment lending, the Treasury official said, and by
stepping up the use of the IMF's so-called compensatory and
contingency financing facilities, as well as enlarging member
countries' access to IMF funds. The compensatory and
contingency financing facilities help IMF member countries
cope with external shocks to their balances of payments.
   Oil prices are now much more volatile than in the past
because of the greater sophistication of the oil markets and
the development of oil futures and other instruments, Mr.
Mulford said. He cautioned against paying too much attention
to the daily price of oil.
   The Treasury undersecretary said he expects that the
meetings over the coming 10 days will give strong support for
the leadership role the U.S. has assumed in confronting the
crisis set off by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   That could entail further forgiveness of Egypt's foreign
military debt, Mr. Mulford said, urging other countries to
follow the U.S. lead and forgive or cut back Egypt's
obligations for military hardware. President Bush recently
proposed to Congress that the U.S. should forgive the about
$7 billion of military debt owed by Egypt, which has been
hard hit by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The G-7 and the IMF and World Bank meetings are expected
to spend time focusing on the difficulties of Egypt, Turkey,
Jordan and other nations particularly hurt by the Gulf
crisis, through reduced trade or lower remittances from
workers abroad.
   Brazil and its coming discussions with creditors also are
expected to be a topic at the IMF and World Bank annual
meetings, said Mr. Mulford, who indicated that the South
American country would have to make an effort to address its
billions of dollars of interest arrears before it secures an
IMF program. Brazil, which hasn't paid interest on its
commercial bank debt in more than a year, says it will begin
formal negotiations with its commercial bank creditors next
month.
   The Soviet Union will attend this year's annual meetings
as an observer, and Mr. Mulford said the U.S. is "looking
forward to them being special guests." He expects the Soviet
economy will be a topic of discussion but indicated that the
issue of economic assistance to that country would probably
have to wait until the completion in December of a study
being carried out by the IMF, the World Bank, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
