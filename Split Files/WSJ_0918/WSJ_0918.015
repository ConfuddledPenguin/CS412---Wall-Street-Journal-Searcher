   TOKYO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
reviewing its ratings of the long-term debt of three Japanese
banks and some units for possible downgrading.
   The three banks are Mitsubishi Bank, rated triple-A; Tokai
Bank, rated double-A-2; and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
or LTCB, also rated double-A-2. The respective Prime-1
ratings of the short-term debt of the banks aren't being
reviewed, Moody's said.

   Mitsubishi and Tokai are Japanese "city banks,"
institutions with nationwide networks of branches. LTCB is
one of Japan's three designated long-term credit banks, which
are primarily wholesale lenders.
   Last month Moody's downgraded two Japanese city banks,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank, after placing them under
review in the spring. And still earlier this year Moody's
downgraded several trust banks, Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking Corp.,
Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp. and Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking
Corp.
   Now put under review, Moody's said, are:
   -- Mitsubishi Bank's long-term deposits, senior debt and
standby letter-of-credit obligations and the senior debt of
the bank's guaranteed subsidiary, Mitsubishi Bank of
Australia Ltd.
   -- Tokai Bank's long-term deposits, senior debt and
letter-of-credit backed obligations.
   -- LTCB's long-term deposits, senior debt and long-term
standby letter-of-credit obligations, Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan Finance N.V.'s senior debt and LTCB Australia Ltd.'s
long-term deposits.
   Moody's cited Mitsubishi Bank's "relatively weak core
profitability and competitive positions among its Japanese
peers" and "vulnerability to domestic asset-quality
deterioration."
   In reviewing Tokai Bank, Moody's will look at the lender's
quality of assets, especially "its domestic real
estate-related loan portfolio and its overseas credits," as
well as its core earnings and competitiveness, the rating
concern said.
   Meanwhile, LTCB's "weakening franchise as a wholesale
bank" as well as the bank's asset quality will come under
scrutiny, Moody's said.
