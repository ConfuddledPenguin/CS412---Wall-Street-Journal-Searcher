   Hallwood Group Inc., Dallas, said the minimum
participation conditions have been met for the consolidation
of 11 real estate partnerships initially sponsored by Equitec
Financial Group Inc.
   The consolidation will take place under Hallwood Realty
Partners L.P., an affiliate of Hallwood Group, which engages
in merchant-banking services and specializes in corporate
rescue financing, and invests in real estate, oil and gas,
restaurants, retailing and textiles. Hallwood Realty Partners
has received consents representing about 82% of the aggregate
exchange values of the 11 Equitec partnerships.

   In a related development, Equitec and its affiliate,
Equitec Properties Co., filed a joint motion in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for Northern District of California last
Friday, seeking authorization to complete the consolidation.
A hearing on the motion was scheduled for Oct. 19; thus, the
deadline yesterday for consolidation was extended to Oct. 1.
