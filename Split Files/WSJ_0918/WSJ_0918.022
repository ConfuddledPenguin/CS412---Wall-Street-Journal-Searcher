   Those whom the gods love die young -- in spirit, if not in
flesh -- and though Kenneth Tynan died 10 years ago at 53,
inside his wasted, emphysematic body he was always the
brilliant boy who took your breath away. Tynan was for many
the greatest evocative drama critic of our time (indeed the
best since Shaw), a theatrical reviewer nonpareil in London
and New York from 1951 to 1963, then literary manager of
Laurence Olivier's National Theatre for the next 10 years. He
also was the man who said "the naughtiest of all four-letter
words" on BBC-TV in 1965 and "devised" the erotic revue "Oh]
Calcutta]" in 1969. A scamp, a Peter Pan.
   A friend of the famous and the toast (or gadfly) of two
continents for nearly 30 years, this glittering virtuoso
lived in "a state of apoplectic veneration" of his heroes,
the great "high-definition performers" in art and life
(actors, writers, comics, matadors). He wrote some 170
profiles of them, and 50 are collected in the book "Profiles
by Kenneth Tynan" (selected and edited by Kathleen Tynan {the
author of the fascinating "Life of Kenneth Tynan"} and Ernie
Eban, Bessie/Harper &amp; Row, 437 pages, $29.95 cloth, $14.95
paper).

   Though the motto pinned above his desk was "Rouse tempers,
goad and lacerate, raise whirlwinds," these profiles are
passionate celebrations of performance -- not least his own.
They run from two superprecocious effusions over Alexander
Woollcott and Orson Welles, published in 1943 in a school
magazine when Tynan was 16; to legendary full-length
portraits of Ralph Richardson, Tom Stoppard, Mel Brooks and
Louise Brooks published in The New Yorker from 1977 to 1979,
a year before Tynan's death. Seventeen have never appeared in
book form before, and since all of Tynan's 10 books are out
of print, this is a necessary volume, at once a duty and a
pleasure. Tynan approved of the Renaissance definition of art
as "that which instructs through delight," and it serves
splendidly to describe this artful book. Just think of
delight in boldface.
   The people we meet here are actors, directors, writers,
comics, a few critics (a wonderful essay on Cyril Connolly,
man and beast, gourmand and man of letters), two jazz
musicians, two Oxford eccentrics and a bullfighter, Antonio
Ordonez, who "kills with kindness." The directors include
Peter Brook and Joan Littlewood, the writers Brecht and
Tennessee Williams, the comics W.C. Fields, Beatrice Lillie
and Lenny Bruce -- "a nightclub Cassandra bringing news of
impending chaos, a tightrope walker between morality and
nihilism, a pearl miscast before swine."
   The actors range from bozos to tragedians, from movies to
nightclubs, from America to Germany. Tynan is superb on
Bogart (who always died like a Senecan stoic, with "such
model nonchalance"); on Cagney with his "spring-heeled walk
and the rich, elated derision of his voice"; on Dietrich,
Garbo and Katharine Hepburn ("her vitality is deafening"); on
Noel Coward ("the monocle of all he surveys"); on Nicol
Williamson in a fine frenzy at Nixon's White House in 1970;
and on Orson Welles (three times), whom Tynan adored as an
"incomparable bravura personality." "Orson coming into a room
is like the sunrise," he once said.
   Incomparably bravura, too, are the profiles of the great
triumvirate of English actors, Laurence Oliver, John Gielgud
and Ralph Richardson. Richardson's "unique physical presence
{is} at once rakish and stately, as of a pirate turned
prelate . . . {He has} a yeasty, agile voice. Where Olivier
would pounce upon a line and rip its heart out, Richardson
skips and lilts and bounces along it, shaving off pathos in
great flakes."
   Gielgud's acting, however, is "a tourney between body and
soul, which soul invariably wins. It is a troubled soul, even
in comedy, where its best moments come from discomfiture,
from dignity dislodged. What is certain is that Gielgud's
style lacks heart and stomach. When Olivier enters, lions
pounce {again]} into the ring, and the stage becomes an
arena. Gielgud, on the other hand, appears; he does not `make
an entrance' . . . The face is reposeful, save when emotion
convulses it, and then it twitches, suddenly constricted,
working intensely, as if a bowl of ammonia had been thrust
beneath its nostrils." To Gielgud's "art" Tynan contrasts
Olivier's "nature," to Gielgud's "beautiful," Olivier's
"sublime." There's even a virtuoso two-column comparison of
them including air/earth, poet/peasant, mind/heart,
spiritual/animal, feminine/masculine, introvert/extrovert,
claret/burgundy.
   As we read, bedazzled, we note how often Tynan works in
brilliant contrasts -- W.C. Fields vs. the Marx Brothers,
Arthur Miller vs. Tennessee Williams, Mel Brooks vs. Woody
Allen. This is pure Oxford Union debating style, the
reductive certainty, the flashing dichotomy, the precise wit
that runs to paradox and aphorism. "The secret of comedy {is}
man's inhumanity to man, and his positive bestiality towards
woman." Or, "It is one of the paradoxes of the theatre that
though every actor's ambition is to stop the show, his
instructions are that it must go on." When Tynan went down
from Oxford in 1948 it seems to have occasioned universal
mourning: "The Golden Age is finished, gone the grace,"
lamented the undergraduate magazine Isis, "Who now so fit to
fill Ken Tynan's place?" Who indeed? Those whom the gods love
die young. As John Osborne implied in a review of Tynan's
biography, the last word belongs to William Shawn, the great
editor of the New Yorker, who upon hearing of Tynan's death
uttered the perfect epitaph: "He was just a boy."
