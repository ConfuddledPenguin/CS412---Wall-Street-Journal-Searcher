   SAN FRANCISCO -- Charter Medical Corp. said it plans sharp
cutbacks in advertising, including campaigns that critics
have said use scare tactics to lure patients to psychiatric
hospitals.
   The decision reflects the financially troubled hospital
company's effort to stem expenses. But it also comes as
purchasers of psychiatric care bristle at soaring costs of
inpatient psychiatric care, particularly for adolescents.

   Several private psychiatric hospitals and hospital
companies, including Charter, have used emotional commercials
portraying parents distraught over troubled teenagers to
market their facilities. Some research suggests that more
than half of teen-age admissions to psychiatric hospitals are
unnecessary.
   "There are some forms of advertising that do bring people
into hospitals who don't need to be there," said Stephen L.
White, Charter's vice president, customer service. "It's
something we want to get away from."
   Robert Friedel, the Macon, Ga., company's vice president
for psychiatric medicine and research, disclosed the
advertising plans in a presentation at a conference here on
mental health benefits. The weekend conference was sponsored
by the Institute for Behavioral Healthcare.
   The company's 90 hospitals spent about $40 million on
advertising last year. Dr. Friedel and Mr. White said that
could be reduced as much as 80% this year and next.
Advertising will be consolidated at the company's
headquarters and developed by one agency -- not yet selected
-- instead of the more than 35 agencies that handled
individual accounts at Charter's hospitals around the
country. Mr. White said in an interview at the conference
that the company's own evaluation indicated television
advertising was only minimally effective in attracting
patients. "It's ironic because advertising is the thing that
angers and annoys most of the group purchasers," he said.
   New advertising will take on an "educational theme," Dr.
Friedel said, aimed at informing people of broad offerings of
mental health care. He said studies suggest that just 20% of
people suffering from some mental illness are actually
getting treatment, while 80% of people with physical ailments
are getting care.
