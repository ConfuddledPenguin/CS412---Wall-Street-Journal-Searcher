   DENVER -- Manville Corp. said it settled a dispute with
the Environmental Protection Agency over its Waukegan, Ill.,
facility, agreeing to pay $165,000 in penalties.
   The EPA alleged that Manville violated a consent decree
that stipulated how the company would clean up asbestos
wastes at the facility by improperly grading the site,
causing asbestos emissions. Manville maintained that the
grading was done according to the consent decree plan, and no
violations had taken place.

   The company said it settled the matter with the EPA "to
resolve the case quickly." In the settlement, the government
stipulated that it never alleged that the violations were
intentional. The $7 million cleanup was completed in May.
