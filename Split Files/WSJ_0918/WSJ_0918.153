   Hawker Siddeley Group PLC said pretax profit for the six
months ended June 30 slumped 29%, hit by a #27.5 million
($52.1 million) contracting loss at its Hawker Siddeley Power
Engineering unit.
   The British electrical and mechanical engineering concern
said pretax profit of #66.6 million, compared with #93.2
million a year ago, was below some market forecasts of #67
million to #70 million.

   The group warned in July that its first-half profits would
fall short of year-ago earnings due to cost overruns at the
power engineering unit. The overruns arose from a combination
of contract delays and unsatisfactory administrative controls
when the unit became overextended by rapid expansion in 1988,
Hawker Siddeley said.
   Profit after tax, less minority interests but before
extraordinary items, dropped 31% to #37.9 million from #55.2
million a year ago. Earnings per share fell to 19.1 pence
from 27.9 pence.
   Hawker Siddeley reported an extraordinary loss of #10.7
million for the period, which it paid to settle disputed U.K.
corporation tax for a period between 1980 and 1984. The
company didn't report any extraordinary items in the year-ago
period.
   Sales were up 14% to #1.12 billion from #981 million.
