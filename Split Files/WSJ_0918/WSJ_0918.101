   MINNEAPOLIS -- General Mills Inc. reported record fiscal
first-quarter earnings and said it anticipates tripling
annual sales to $19.2 billion in the current decade, with
much of that gain coming overseas.
   In the quarter ended Aug. 26, General Mills earnings rose
13% to $129.5 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with $114.9
million, or $1.39 a share, a year earlier. The latest figures
include gains from discontinued operations equal to seven
cents a share, compared with gains of nine cents a share a
year earlier. Sales for the latest quarter rose 16% to $1.74
billion, compared with $1.5 billion previously.

   "We expect 1991 to be another year of record sales,
earnings and earnings per share," Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer H. Brewster Atwater Jr. told shareholders
at the annual meeting here.
   For the fiscal year ended last May 27, the packaged foods
and restaurant company reported sales of $6.4 billion and
earnings of $373.7 million.
   In projecting growth by the year 2000, Mr. Atwater said
the Olive Garden Italian restaurant chain alone is expected
to achieve sales "well over $2 billion, with growing
profitability." Currently, Olive Garden has about 10% of the
$4.5 billion Italian restaurant market, or about $450 million
in annual sales.
   The company gave no sales projection for its largest
restaurant chain, Red Lobster, but Mr. Atwater said the
seafood operation, along with Olive Garden, foresees "major
expansion opportunities" beyond North America. Red Lobster
already operates more than 40 units in Japan.
   As reported, General Mills anticipates $1 billion in
European sales of cereals by the century's end from its
recent joint venture with Nestle S.A., called Cereal Partners
Worldwide. Eventually, that venture is expected to enter
other international markets where General Mills now has no
presence.
   In the quarter just ended the company said its Big G
cereals division achieved a record 28% dollar sales share of
the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, narrowing Kellogg Co.'s
lead, which is estimated at about 38%. "We believe per-capita
{cereal} consumption will continue to increase steadily" to
35% of all breakfasts within 10 years, compared with about
30% today, Mr. Atwater said.
   Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split yesterday, to be
distributed Nov. 7 to holders of record Oct. 10. General
Mills said future dividend payments will be consistent with
its approximate 50% earnings payout policy.
   Holders approved a plan whereby General Mills management
could receive stock options instead of salary merit
increases.
