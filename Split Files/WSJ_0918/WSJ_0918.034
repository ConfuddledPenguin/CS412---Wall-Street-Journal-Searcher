   NEW YORK -- First Union Corp., after a hefty banking and
savings and loan acquisition binge in the late 1980s, intends
to concentrate on increasing market share rather than further
expansion through acquisition.
   Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., chairman of the Charlotte,
N.C., banking company, noted that because of the
acquisitions, First Union's earnings have been sluggish the
past three years. "Now we'll try to make them pay off."

   Mr. Crutchfield said he doesn't disagree with analysts'
consensus estimates of per-share earnings of about $2.80 in
1990. "Unless the wheels come off in the fourth quarter we
will reach that."
   In 1989, First Union earned $256.2 million, or $2.40 a
share. In the first half of 1990, profit rose 2% to 149
million, or $1.39 a share, compared with the year-earlier
$146 million, or $1.37 a share.
   Since 1985, when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed regional
interstate banking, the company has made 22 acquisitions,
including Florida National Bank for $850 million in January.
It now has about $38 billion in assets, compared with $7
billion in 1985.
   Mr. Crutchfield said the company's five-year goal will be
to double the earnings of 1989 through consolidation and cost
cutting. Also, it would attempt to increase market share in
regions where it already does business rather than through
expansion into other regions.
   Mr. Crutchfield said the goal would be to increase market
share in the southeast region to 16%. The company says it
currently has about an 8.2% share of the market in four
states -- North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida
-- where it has most of its offices. "I don't see going out
to other states," Crutchfield said. "I'd rather have the 16%
market share in the four regions."
   Much of the growth is based on company's projection that
the region will experience a heavy influx in population, and
indications that the area's GNP growth will be double the
nation's GNP growth of about 2%.
