   IRS EASES TESTS for retirement plans. But benefit
consultants want more.
   In 67 pages of amendments to 300-plus pages of rules
proposed four months ago, the IRS has softened the tests it
wants companies to perform to prove that tax-favored
retirement plans don't discriminate in favor of highly
compensated employees. The new version doesn't make it any
easier to avoid the tests; most big companies still can't
qualify for so-called safe harbors that are automatically
judged fair, consultant Towers Perrin says. Nor will it be
any easier to assemble and program the extensive salary and
benefits information needed for the tests, Buck Consultants
adds.

   However, in response to complaints that the original tests
simply weren't workable, the IRS's new rules say companies
will be able to break the data into smaller sets of numbers
to show that plans aren't skewed in favor of top-paid
managers. "Most plans now are likely to pass," Towers Perrin
declares. Mercer notes that employee stock ownership plans
also get a break.
   In hearings next week, the consultants will press for more
flexibility and softer rules for 401(k) savings plans.
                                                                                                       

   TOUGH TIMES prove worth of giving workers more say,
companies assert.
   Rubbermaid Inc. says it would "be surprised" if anyone
were scrapping innovative programs giving employees more
voice in their work lives in favor of old-line management
controls. Hewlett-Packard Co., even with cost controls and
hiring curbs, "looks to people involved in teams to take more
responsibility and help more with decision-making." To Analog
Devices Inc., "the argument is survival."
   H.J. Heinz Co. figures it will generate $200 million in
annual savings within four years by listening to teams of
employees enlisted to boost productivity and trim waste. In
one such effort at a StarKist factory in Puerto Rico,
employee teams observed that tuna was being wasted because
workers couldn't keep up with an accelerated processing line.
Spending $4 million for additional equipment and $5 million a
year for extra hands now saves the company $100 million
annually, Heinz says.
                                                                                                       

   WEAK ECONOMIES force some cities to trim payrolls. But
many plug on.
   Baltimore, balking at raising property taxes to meet
budget pressures, in the past year has sent layoff notices to
200 workers and trimmed a further 800 staffers through
attrition, bringing to 2,500 the number cut in the past 2 1/2
years. Dallas adds 150 police officers but drops 140 workers
and freezes hiring in other departments in the fourth year of
a retrenchment campaign. Stamford, Conn., lays off 55 of its
1,500.
   But Harrisburg, Pa., which considers itself
recession-proof because of federal and state offices, has
been increasing municipal employment 3% to 5% a year over the
past eight years. New York City, which went through a major
crunch several years back, plans to add several thousand
police. Richardson, Texas, has added 30 workers over the past
five years.
   Syracuse, N.Y., beefs up its staff of in-house lawyers on
the presumption they are cheaper than outside counsel.
                                                                                                       

   EXECUTIVE HIRES cost more. The Employment Management
Association says companies spent an average of $7,488 to hire
a professional or managerial employee last year, up 23% from
1988. Hourly workers, at $672 a hire, cost 24% less.
                                                                                                       

   GOALS CHANGE. Employers adopting flexible-benefit plans
now say their primary motivation is holding down
health-insurance costs, consultant Noble Lowndes says.
Companies previously had said they were responding to
employee needs.
                                                                                                       

   EQUALITY, ALMOST. Female employees accounted for one in
five transfers last year, up from one in 25 a decade ago, the
Employee Relocation Council says.
                                                                                                       

   NETWORK WORLD, a computer weekly, taps its data base to
bring together recruiters and subscribers. For a $1,000 fee,
it scrolls through its roster of 100,000 subscribers to find
up to 100 candidates, and then asks who is interested in the
job.
                                                                                                       

   HEALTH PROMOTION brings dollars-and-cents return, a study
shows.
   Each dollar invested in workplace health education can
yield $1.42 over two years in lower absentee costs. So
concludes a study in the American Journal of Public Health by
Robert Bertera, manager of health promotion programs at Du
Pont Co. The report, based on a two-year study of Du Pont
blue-collar workers, shows absences from illnesses unrelated
to the job dropped 14% at 41 sites where the program was
offered, against a 5.8% decline at 19 sites that didn't have
the campaign.
   The program -- which includes a health-risk survey,
counseling and classes on smoke-cessation, general fitness,
diet, stress management and healthy backs -- in the first
year returned $1.11 in lower absentee costs for each dollar
spent, even with relatively high start-up expenses. The
second year's return jumped to $2.05, the study finds.
   Other studies show health promotion also can lower medical
insurance costs, Mr. Bertera says.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: We knew there's going to be a shortage of
workers at the end of the century, but bosses, too?
Consultant Right Associates says nearly half the executives
surveyed think there won't be enough supervisors to go
around. . . . As for today's unemployed, is this the silver
lining? Kennedy Publications says the outplacement business
grew 42% in 1989 and should top $500 million this year.
