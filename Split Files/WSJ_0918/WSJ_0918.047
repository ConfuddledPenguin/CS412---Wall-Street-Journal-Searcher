   NEW YORK -- Apple Bancorp Inc. said it will cancel its
poison-pill anti-takeover measure if real estate investor
Stanley Stahl buys all shares tendered to him and holds a
majority of the stock before the annual meeting.
   The bank holding company has been fighting Mr. Stahl's
$38-a-share tender offer, but yesterday said its board is now
neutral on the takeover offer. The bank also postponed its
annual meeting to Oct. 10 from Oct. 1 to give Mr. Stahl more
time. Mr. Stahl's offer expires Oct. 1.

   A spokesman for Mr. Stahl declined to comment.
   Apple Bancorp said that its financial adviser, Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., expressed no opinion on
whether the offer is fair or unfair to shareholders. And
given "adverse market conditions for the sale of healthy
thrift institutions," Apple said it has been unable to line
up an alternative transaction.
   Mr. Stahl currently is soliciting proxies from
shareholders in an effort to take control of Apple's board.
The bank said that if Mr. Stahl buys all shares tendered to
him before the meeting, it also will withdraw its board
nominees. Earlier this month, Mr. Stahl said more than two
million shares had been tendered, enough to provide him a 76%
stake in Apple when combined with shares he already owned.
   But Apple directors are "concerned that if Mr. Stahl
succeeds in taking control of the company in the proxy
contest, he will either terminate his tender offer without
purchasing any shares" or cut the $38 offer price, said
Jerome R. McDougal, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Poison pills such as the one Apple's board adopted last
November allow shareholders to buy, under certain
circumstances, more shares at half price. The plan was
designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Apple Bancorp's shares rose 37.5 cents to $33.125 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
