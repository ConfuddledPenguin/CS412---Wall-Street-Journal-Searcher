   PS Group Inc.'s board amended the company's shareholder
rights plan to allow ownership of up to 22.5% of the
company's common stock by companies controlled by Warren E.
Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
   PS Group said the amendment was in response to a request
by Mr. Buffett that Berkshire Hathaway or its affiliates be
permitted to acquire more than 20% of PS Group stock. As of
May, three companies controlled by Mr. Buffett held about an
11% stake.

   A Berkshire Hathaway official in Omaha, Neb., wouldn't say
how many PS Group shares the company or its affiliates
currently own.
   PS Group, an aircraft leasing and holding company based in
San Diego, said the board considers Mr. Buffett to be "a very
constructive long-term investor."
