   The Jewish Museum, New York: "A Day in the Warsaw Ghetto"

birthday taking pictures inside the ghetto, where

died "natural" deaths from starvation and illness. Diary
excerpts accompany the photographs. On view here till Nov. 1

through March 1995.
                                                                                                       

   Museum of Modern Art, New York: "Lady Hawarden, Victorian
Photographer" -- The dreamy young women captured in a variety

world. 11 West 53rd Street, till Oct. 9.

   The 14th annual Margaret Mead Film Festival presents 45

marriage in Ethiopia; the relationships between women and
Japanese soldiers stationed in Papua New Guinea during World
War II; and the difficulties of shooting a major Western
motion picture in China. New Yorkers and others familiar with

   Seattle Opera: The company opens its fall season with a
revival of that old dog and pony show, "Cavalleria
Rusticana," coupled, for a curious change of pace, not with

Schicchi" directed by Francesca Zambello and designed by
