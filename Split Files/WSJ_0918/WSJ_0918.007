   ATLANTA -- Gerald Hogan, 44 years old, resigned as the No.
2 executive of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. to become vice
chairman of Whittle Communications LP, continuing an exodus
of senior executives from the cable programming concern.
   In the past 13 months, Chairman Ted Turner has lost both
of his top two lieutenants. Robert Wussler, Mr. Turner's
right-hand man for 10 years, resigned in August 1989 to
become chief executive officer of Communications Satellite
Corp.'s Comsat Video Enterprises unit. And now, Mr. Hogan, a
protege of Mr. Turner's since 1971 and president of Turner's
entertainment networks since 1987, is leaving to run several
of Whittle's publications as well as some confidential
businesses still on the drawing board.

   Moreover, earlier this year Arthur Sando, Turner
Broadcasting's former vice president of marketing and
communications, left the company to join Mr. Wussler at
Comsat, and Farrell Reynolds, Turner Broadcasting's former
vice president of sales, resigned to take a similar post at
Whittle.
   The departures have left Mr. Turner with a dearth of
senior talent, said analysts and executives close to the
company.
   "The bullpen is not particularly deep," said Larry
Gerbrandt, senior vice president of Paul Kagan Associates
Inc., a Carmel, Calif., market research firm. "There isn't
anybody there who I can point to and say, `He's ready to take
over.'"
   Mr. Turner wasn't available for comment, but he issued a
two-sentence statement crediting Mr. Hogan with helping make
Turner Broadcasting successful and wishing him well. He
didn't name a successor for Mr. Hogan, who departs the
company in two weeks. Mr. Turner's response was in sharp
contrast to Mr. Wussler's departure, when he issued a
detailed statement outlining how the executive's former
duties would be reassigned.
   The conspicuous silence led some executives close to the
company to speculate that Mr. Turner will try to add
management from outside -- something he has done infrequently
over the years. In July, he brought in W. Thomas Johnson Jr.,
former vice chairman of Times Mirror Co., to be president of
Cable News Network.
   At Whittle, 50%-owned by Time Warner Inc., Mr. Hogan will
join two other executives with the rank of vice chairmen.
Each of them is also a senior partner in the limited
partnership, as is the company's chairman, Chris Whittle. Mr.
Hogan will presumably help Whittle diversify its media
properties, which are targeted at specific audiences such as
school children and patients in doctors' offices. The company
has been trying in recent years to expand from its strength
in print into video-based media.
   Mr. Hogan said he is making the move because "the next
position here is Ted's, and that isn't available." In
addition, he said, "I think I enjoy the building part {of
business} more than the operating part. I'm not learning a
lot at this point. I'm repeating things."
