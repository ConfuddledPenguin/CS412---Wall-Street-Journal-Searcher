   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee is planning hearings on
whether the huge U.S. government securities market needs more
federal oversight of sales techniques.
   The 1986 Government Securities Act, which precludes
regulation of government securities sales practices, will
expire next year. That has some members on Capitol Hill
questioning the current sales environment, where $225 billion
of debt securities are traded daily, according to House
figures. "The evidence of current abuses in the government
securities market raises the issue of whether such an
exemption from sales practice regulation is still warranted,"
Reps. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) and Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.)
wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rep. Markey
is chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee of which Mr. Cooper is a member. A subcommittee
staffer said the hearings likely will be held next year.

   Last week, the General Accounting Office called for
regulation of government securities market sales practices.
If sales practice rules "make sense for other securities
markets, then they also make sense for the government market
as well, because there are similar opportunities for abuse in
both types of markets," the GAO said.
   The Treasury Department, SEC and Federal Reserve Board are
due to submit a joint report to Congress shortly on the
government securities market.
