   The Cleveland-based greeting card maker earned 80 cents a
share for the six months ended Aug. 31, the highest
first-half net in its 84-year history.
   The company attributed the record earnings to cost control
measures and gains in core card lines, "anytime" cards and
accessories including gift bags and boxes.
   Net for the first half jumped 13% to $25.5 million, or 80
cents a share, from $22.5 million, or 70 cents a share.
Revenue for the first half increased 9% to $623 million from
$572.5 million.
