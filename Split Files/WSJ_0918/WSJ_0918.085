   ("Our bosses aren't very responsive, most workers
believe." -- WSJ news item)
                                                                                                       

   This is a true statement,
   And here's how I know why:
   I asked my boss about it
   And he would not reply.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   Second Choice
                                                                                                       

   When a thing must be done
   I do it myself;
   I don't put a problem
   Up on a shelf.
   I dig in at once
   And go right to it --
   If I cannot find
   Someone else to do it.
   -- Joshua Adams.
