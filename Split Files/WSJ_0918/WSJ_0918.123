   Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in
an attempt to "ensure an orderly disposition of the company's
remaining assets."
   The company's main asset, Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan
Association, was seized in April by federal regulators.
Financial Corp. officials said they recently reached a
tentative agreement to dispose of the company's
check-processing operation, its one remaining operating
subsidiary.

   Officials said the company's "most significant" creditors
are the holders of $8.4 million in principal amount of
convertible subordinated debentures issued by Santa Barbara
Savings. The S&amp;L defaulted on the debentures after the
federal seizure, and the debenture trustee is now seeking
repayment directly from Financial Corp.
