   The forced-busing war isn't over in Seattle. The school
board voted 4 to 3 this month to relax integration mandates
so as to permit students to attend where they and their
parents wished. But the local NAACP chapter threatened to sue
and, more important, the U.S. Education Department said it
might have to cut off funding for "magnet" schools in the
district because they could be out of racial balance.
Morever, the state warned construction money could be lost.
So the board, with what a member called an "economic gun to
its head," postponed the new plan for a year. But it did
manage to end busing of kindergartners. Result: The Seattle
schools, after two decades of steady enrollment decline,
gained 2,500 students this fall.
