   CHICAGO -- A federal judge here sentenced a former tax
preparer to two years in prison for failing to report more
than $230,000 of his income.
   Judge Suzanne B. Conlon also sentenced 34-year-old Kenneth
H. Stenzel to five years on probation and ordered him not to
work in any fiduciary capacity during that time. Mr. Stenzel
had pleaded guilty to the tax charges as part of a plea
agreement with federal prosecutors.
