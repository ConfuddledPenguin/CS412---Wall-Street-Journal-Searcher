   Who is a baby's mother: the woman who provides the ovum or
the woman who provides the womb?
   That's the question a Santa Ana, Calif., court is being
asked to decide in a lawsuit filed last month by a surrogate
mother. It is one of a growing number of cases that experts
say could redefine the legal meaning of parenthood.

   Anna Johnson, 29 years old, is eight months pregnant with
an implanted embryo produced with sperm and eggs supplied by
Mark and Crispina Calvert. She has sued the Calverts, seeking
custody of the baby she is carrying for them. Her case raises
novel legal questions because Ms. Johnson has no genetic
connection to the unborn child.
   "In the Bible, when two women were claiming to be the
mother of the same child, King Solomon offered to divide the
child in half and give part to each. Now the courts are being
forced to consider the notion that a child can have more than
two parents," says Lori Andrews, a lawyer specializing in
reproductive law at the American Bar Foundation in Chicago.
   This quiet legal revolution has been spurred by
fundamental social and medical changes. The increase in
divorce and the number of stepfamilies has meant that many
adults perform all the functions of a parent without legal or
biological ties to a child. Rapidly evolving medical
technologies, such as the in vitro fertilization used in the
Johnson case and artificial insemination, have also raised
concerns about the legal definition of family.
   In recent years, courts around the country have created
doctrines that give stepparents and others with no genetic
connection to a child expanded legal rights. Many of these
courts are ruling that the best interests of the child may
outweigh the natural parent's constitutional rights to make
decisions about the child's upbringing.
   Some family lawyers worry that the changes will result in
too many people calling themselves parents. These lawyers
contend that expanding the legal definition of parenthood
will increase litigation over custody, visitation and other
rights.
   But other legal experts say that looking at a biological
relationship is no longer sufficient to determine who is a
parent. They say the courts must accept the reality of "how
widespread the phenomenon of complex parental relationships
is," says Nancy D. Polikoff, an associate professor at
American University Law School.
   Ms. Johnson's battle typifies the social challenges
confronting the courts. She has no genetic connection to her
unborn child, but California law says the woman who gives
birth is the mother.
   "There is no law that says anything about the parental
rights of parties that donate an embryo that was formulated
in a petri dish," says Richard Gilbert, a lawyer for Ms.
Johnson from the Santa Ana law firm Gilbert &amp; Marlowe. "Anna
is the mother of the child. She has bonded to the baby in her
womb."
   Robert Walmsley, a lawyer for the Calverts with the Santa
Ana law firm Van Deusen, Youmans &amp; Walmsley, says that
biologically the child is the Calverts'. "The court must
acknowledge and protect the biological link. There isn't
anything else at this point," he says.
   Custody suits filed by lesbian couples who reared children
together and separated are pending in appeals courts in New
York, New Mexico and California. The women are relying on
protections that used to be reserved for traditional
families.
   Michele G., a 43-year-old graduate student, wants to be
recognized as a parent of two children she reared with her
ex-lover, the biological mother. The couple split up in 1985
after 15 years together. (Court papers don't use the women's
full names.)
   As part of a verbal agreement, Michele G. retained custody
of the older child, a girl. Her former lover, Nancy S., who
conceived the children through artificial insemination, kept
custody of the younger child, a boy.
   But in 1988, Nancy S. sued for custody of both children. A
lower court in Alameda County denied Michele G. standing as a
parent and terminated her rights to visit the children. Her
case is pending before an appeals court in San Francisco.
   She contends that she acted in every way as a parent and
was listed on the children's birth certificates as their
father. "The children were born because of a joint decision,"
says Amy Oppenheimer, an Oakland, Calif., lawyer representing
Michele G. "It's not fair to the children for the court to
now say that only one of them is their mother."
   But Carol Amyx, a lawyer for Nancy S., says Michele G.'s
reasoning could be used to open the door for too many people
to become parents. "Children will potentially be placed in
the midst of multiparty custody litigation on a much more
frequent basis," says Ms. Amyx of Berkeley.
   Some courts have been willing to create legal doctrines
when they have believed continuing a significant relationship
is in a child's best interests. During divorce proceedings,
Harold J. Atkinson learned that he wasn't the biological
father of a child born during his marriage. A lower court
awarded custody of the child to his ex-wife, Terri, and
denied visitation rights to Mr. Atkinson.
   But a Michigan appeals court in Detroit in 1987 overturned
that decision, ruling that Mr. Atkinson could be considered
an "equitable parent" because he and the child acknowledged
each other as father and son and Mr. Atkinson was willing to
accept the rights and financial responsibilities of being a
parent.
   But Paul W. Harty, a Birmingham lawyer representing Mrs.
Atkinson, says it was poor law to allow a husband who isn't
the biological father to acquire rights after living with a
child for the first two years of his life. "I'm afraid that
this case will permit a vindictive husband to create problems
not only for his former wife but her child," Mr. Harty says.
   In other cases, courts have refused to grant a plaintiff
parental rights but nonetheless articulated new rules that
appear to expand the legal definition of parenthood. Last
year, the appellate division of a New Jersey state court in
Hackensack ruled that third parties who can prove they "stand
in the shoes of a parent to the child" will be treated like
natural parents by the courts. And in 1988, a New Jersey
state court in Trenton found that visitation and other
parental privileges can be extended to stepparents who can
show a significant bond with the child.
   Courts have also begun to re-examine legislation adopted
to deal with new medical technologies. More than 30 states
have enacted artificial insemination laws in which sperm
donors, with the exception of the husband, have no parental
rights.
   These laws, enacted under the assumption that the woman
wouldn't know the sperm donor, failed to take into account a
situation like Kevin McIntyre's, says his lawyer, Ronald A.
Fontana of Portland, Ore. Mr. McIntyre, a teacher, donated
sperm to a friend of 12 years, Linden Crouch. Mr. McIntyre
claims that Ms. Crouch reneged on her promise that he could
help raise the child, born in 1986.
   Last year, an Oregon appeals court in Salem ruled that the
state's 1977 artificial insemination law violated Mr.
McIntyre's constitutional rights. G. Philip Arnold, a lawyer
with Drescher &amp; Arnold of Ashland who is representing Ms.
Crouch, said the court's ruling could be extended to
anonymous donors who change their minds and then obtain the
mother's identity.
   "In the past, the courts tended to look at how much time
the father spent with the child in trying to determine
parental rights. But this court is saying that a sperm donor
may have rights if he just attempts to establish a
relationship," says reproductive law specialist Ms. Andrews.
   The case was settled this month. Mr. McIntyre was
acknowledged to have legal rights as a father, including
regular visitation, says Mr. Fontana.
   Stepparents have benefited significantly from the latest
changes. Traditionally denied parental rights, more courts
are awarding them custody. Six states have enacted statutes
that grant visitation rights to stepparents if the marriage
dissolves or the natural parent dies.
   In addition, the American Bar Association's family law
section is expected this January to consider a model act that
could be adopted by state legislatures. The proposed bill
would establish a legal relationship between stepparents and
stepchildren in the areas of child support, custody,
discipline and visitation.
   "The time has come to recognize the right of stepparents
to come into court and determine the best interests of the
child," says Joel Tenenbaum, chairman of the committee that
drafted the proposed act and a lawyer with the Wilmington,
Del., law firm Woloshin, Tenenbaum &amp; Natalie.
