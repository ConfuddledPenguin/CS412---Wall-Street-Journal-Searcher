   Problem loans come in all sizes for America's bankers.
Their latest worry is that hard economic times will lead to
increased defaults on credit-card debt.
   Bankers attending the American Bankers Association's Bank
Card Conference this week in New York said that higher
default rates already are showing up in New England. And even
though the card business is enormously profitable, they are
bracing for increasing defaults to slice into those margins
in coming months.

   Figures released yesterday by the American Bankers
Association show that bad consumer credit-card debt already
is on the rise. U.S. banks last year charged off $400 million
more of credit-card debt than in 1988, the ABA said. That
brought the total write-off to $3.7 billion, or 3% of the
total $121.6 billion outstanding credit card debt.
   In 1988, a year of more vigorous economic growth, credit
card charge-offs totaled $3.3 billion, or 2.8% of the total.
   Bankers are expecting it to get worse. "In a deteriorating
economy we can expect to see a 10% to 15% increase in
charge-offs," says James Bailey, group executive of U.S.
credit-card operations at Citicorp, the nation's largest
issuer of credit cards.
   At the same time, though, the bankers are in a fighting
mood because of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s push
into their business.
   "Banks are caught in a squeeze play," says Spencer Nilson,
editor of a credit-card newsletter, "They're trapped between
deteriorating economic conditions and horrible competitive
pressures from AT&amp;T."
   The program for the three-day conference highlights the
conflict. Following one of the opening sessions yesterday,
entitled "Our Changing Competition," were others such as
"Bankruptcy Risk Control" and "Cardholder Fraud Risk
Control."
   To minimize the increased risks, bankers say they are
turning down more applicants for new credit cards, granting
smaller credit lines to those they accept, and keeping a
closer watch on consumer spending habits.
   "We're looking at our credit policy more carefully in New
England, no question," says George Fesus, executive vice
president of State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Boston.
   Yet at the same time competitive pressures are leading
many other banks to charge ahead with aggressive efforts to
get their plastic into more wallets. Signet Bank is just one
credit-card issuer that is offering college students with no
credit history a charge card with a $2,000 credit limit. MNC
Financial Corp. tells analysts it plans to double to $13
billion the outstanding consumer charges on MNC-issued credit
cards in the next three years.
   Bankers are competing fiercely because of AT&amp;T's new, no
fee credit cards, an estimated five million of which are
expected to be in consumers' hands by year-end. AT&amp;T began
its promotions in the spring.
   Other analysts, however, contend that while charge-offs
might rise in coming months, credit card portfolios will
remain among the most profitable products bankers can offer.
   "I think banks are intellectually ready to see charge-offs
go up," says James McCormick, president of First Manhattan
Consulting Group. "But the business is so massively
profitable that they can afford to sit back and make 35%
returns on equity for a few years instead of 40%." Most banks
are happy to earn a 15% return on equity in their overall
business.
