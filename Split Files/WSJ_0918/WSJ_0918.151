   The unions at United Airlines plan to meet with banks this
week to discuss a new offer of $175 to $180 a share, or $3.82
billion to $3.92 billion, for United's parent UAL Corp.,
people familiar with the situation said.
   The new offer probably will include participation by a
foreign airline, officials close to the proposed deal said. A
logical possibility would be British Airways PLC, which was a
principal equity investor in a $300-a-share labor-management
bid that collapsed last October. British Air declined to
comment and leaders of the buy-out group declined to identify
the foreign carriers they say have expressed interest in
backing a new offer.

   The crisis in the Middle East scuttled labor's hopes of
completing the $201-a-share, $4.38 billion buy-out plan that
UAL's board accepted last April. With that agreement due to
expire Oct. 9, it's unclear how the UAL board will greet a
lower offer.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, UAL common closed at $97.375, off $1.875 on volume
of 232,000 shares.
   The unions recently recruited First Chicago Corp. to join
Bankers Trust New York Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp.,
and Security Pacific Corp. as lead banks for a proposed bank
credit of about $2 billion.
   The unions invited about two dozen banks to this week's
meeting, where their financial advisers are expected to
outline plans for a new offer consisting of cash and
securities. One individual familiar with the agenda
cautioned, however, that plans for a new offer are "still
evolving and are subject to change."
   Other financing being discussed for the new offer includes
sale-leasebacks of aircraft, subordinated financing from
airline suppliers and equity from the United pilots'
retirement savings plan.
   One person familiar with the bank negotiations said
British Air has expressed an interest in backing a new
transaction, but that the British carrier apparently is
reluctant to have its name publicly associated with the
transaction while there is still a strong chance it might not
proceed.
   British Air executives, while apparently open to
participating in the buy-out, are said to favor waiting until
the other financing pieces are in place.
   Buy-out leaders also have been reluctant to discuss the
possibility of British Air's participlation. The debacle
following the collapse of last year's labor-management
buy-out drove a wedge between the London-based carrier's top
executives and placed a strain on relations between the
managements of the two airlines. British Air, which has a
marketing agreement with United, steered clear of any efforts
to revive the deal earlier this year.
   The planned new offer's nominal $175 to $180-a-share
pricetag might have to be discounted to allow for the fact
that some of the securities might not be worth their full
face value, according to an individual familiar with the
proposal.
   In addition, the enthusiasm of the banks toward the
proposed new plan is likely to be muted by continuing
uncertainty over how the price of oil might fluctuate against
a background of possible hostilities in the Persian Gulf.
Slight changes in aircraft fuel prices can have a huge impact
on an airline's long-term profit projections.
   Still, the possible participation of British Airways could
boost the unions' chances of securing financing. One of the
banks' major concerns about the lapsed $201-a-share offer in
April was its lack of an equity investment from an outside
participant. In that plan, the unions had sought to count
$1.5 billion in wage concessions over five years as equity.
   Sources close to the buy-out group said any outside
investors, including foreign carriers, wouldn't receive
common stock in the carrier, but may receive preferred shares
in return for their investment.
   The next meeting of UAL's board is scheduled for Sept. 27.
It isn't clear whether the new union proposal will be ready
by then. But one person familiar with the board said it is
difficult to predict the directors' response.
   The same individual added: "A year ago they {the
directors} agreed to sell for $300 a share. Just four months
ago it was $200. Now they're going to be asked to take
something like $150, half of what it was a year ago? You even
have to wonder whether the next offer will be real. This
company has great routes, and there are other opportunities
out there. I don't know how they would come out."
   If the new offer proceeds, it would mark the fifth time
United's pilots' union has launched a bid for the company.
The United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association made
its first offer in April 1987. Last April, the pilots joined
forces with the unions representing United's machinists and
flight attendants in an effort to buy the carrier.
