   NCR Corp. is expected today to announce a sweeping
redesign of its product line based on Intel Corp.'s
microprocessors and standard software.
   NCR is the first major computer maker to make an
across-the-board commitment to Intel's chips, which are far
less costly than the custom processors used in midsized and
large computers by International Business Machines Corp.,
Digital Equipment Corp. and other companies.

   NCR historically has had a strong presence in retail and
banking niches but has been weak in the general-purpose
computer market. The new line is aimed at this broader
market, and eventually will span laptop to mainframe-class
systems, executives say. Charles E. Exley, chairman and chief
executive officer, calls the announcement "the most
significant product introduction in NCR's 106-year history."
   The move also means more bad news for Motorola Inc.'s
struggling chip business. Motorola, which also supplies Apple
Computer Inc., has been making processors for NCR's Tower
computer line since 1983.
   Computer consultants generally applauded NCR's strategy.
Portia Isaacson, of BIS CAP International, a Nynex Corp.
market-research unit, went so far as to call it "the most
significant computer announcement since the IBM PC" because
it shows even old-line companies are moving to standardize on
Intel. She believes the PC chip and successors will own the
industry by the end of the decade.
   But Tom Willmott, a consultant with Boston-based Aberdeen
Group, questioned how soon sophisticated software would be
available that will allow NCR to mount an effective challenge
to IBM and Digital's mid-range and large systems. While he
said pricing and performance of the line was "impressive," he
added, "price and design aren't the issue with big customers
-- software is what sells computers."
   NCR is expected to outline future products from small
terminals that can recognize handwriting to large mainframes
using hundreds of Intel chips operating in parallel -- the
fruit of a joint venture announced earlier this year with
Teradata Corp., Los Angeles. Among the products ready now are
network servers that compete with IBM's AS/400 minicomputer,
Digital's MicroVAX and Compaq Computer Corp.'s SystemPro. A
multiprocessor system, using two to four PC chips working in
tandem, will be shipped by the 1991 second quarter, NCR said.
   Analysts say one of the biggest challenges NCR will face
is selling through relatively weak distribution channels.
Direct sales are expensive, and NCR's only big retail outlet
is Businessland Inc.
   Indeed, the first market for the new System 3000 line is
likely to be NCR's current customers, which have been loyal
buyers of retail and banking terminals but usually turn to
others for large systems. Thomas A. Mays, senior vice
president, says the 3000 line "will greatly expand the
markets we address and spur new revenue growth."
   That should cheer investors. NCR's revenue hit a plateau
at $6 billion in 1988 and hasn't moved much since then. Its
shares closed yesterday at $58, down $1.50, in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading.
