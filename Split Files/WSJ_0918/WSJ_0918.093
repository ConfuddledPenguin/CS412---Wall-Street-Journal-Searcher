   The Harvard Business Review has always wanted to be the
one academic journal on the manager's desk. Now it wants to
see more of those managers curl up with the review and read
it.
   The bimonthly publication, the nation's
largest-circulation academic business review, is becoming
"more magaziney," its editors say. Known by its bland "table
of contents" covers, the magazine is sporting a new look in
its issue now in the mail.

   Breaking tradition, it has an illustration on its cover, a
colorful, two-page table of contents, and even a quiz
assessing executive overconfidence that just might be
described as "self-help."
   Gingerly, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, editor since December, is
pushing to make the 68-year-old publication more attractive
to a managerial generation that has neither the time nor
inclination to wade through a more ponderous journal.
   The review's subscription pool, which has remained at
about 205,000 for several years, is already 94% managerial
and professional. But she wants the prestigious but stodgy
review to be more of a conversation piece with those managers
-- and with decision makers in Washington.
   Already, she says, "fewer and fewer are being sold just
for coffee table display." But as an academic and a
consultant, Ms. Kanter knows how hard it is for management
wisdom to penetrate into practice. She wants the magazine to
be "used. We want to arouse, provoke."
   The review won't discuss profits or advertising, but
Martin S. Walker, president of Periodical Studies Service,
New York-based magazine consultants, says that a more popular
format would help raise circulation and attract media buyers
"who are not necessarily readers." The review's advertisers
currently range from Alfa Romeo cars to German banks.
   The push to make the review more reader-friendly began in
the mid-1980s under Theodore Levitt. But when he left the
journal in December, he said that he had worked at making it
"more accessible . . . without being alluring. It can never
be alluring without losing its authority."
   But Ms. Kanter apparently thinks the review can have both
allure and authority. While stressing this is simply an
evolution from Mr. Levitt's approach, she adds that her team
was concerned that "readers may not see . . . the richer,
livelier array" Mr. Levitt helped to create.
   In one Levitt issue, a note told readers, "if HBR had the
kind of cover you see on other business publications, this
issue would feature an illustration. . . ."
   Now, though HBR still doesn't look like Fortune or Forbes,
the first thing that readers will notice on the cover of the
current issue is a small drawing of Uncle Sam characters
passing money. Even the typeface on the traditional white
cover is printed more boldly in red, white and blue. Ms.
Kanter's team had considered an all-art cover, but she says
focus groups with subscribers indicated they liked the cover
listings. That design, she says, helps HBR to "stand out"
from other magazines.
   Inside, a full table of contents -- new to the review --
features illustrations and pictorial icons that highlight
articles. Ms. Kanter notes that today's managers in corporate
meetings are treated to graphic overheads to make a point.
HBR has to grab the attention of people overloaded with
information, she says.
   And the review also is launching a number of regular
monthly features in an attempt to vary the "classic" format
of academic essays, Ms. Kanter says. Emblematic is First
Person, an account from the management trenches that
necessarily uses the voice of the manager, not the professor.
Although Prof. Kanter would never use the phrase "how-to,"
the idea, she says, is to make management theories "live" for
the working manager.
   Another department, In Question, replaces "For the
Manager's Bookshelf." An essay discusses a given topic by
looking not only at books, but at any other media that tackle
the issue, from videos to conferences. "We know readers are
getting {information} from other sources than print," says
Ms. Kanter. This month's In Question focuses on the role of
big shareholders.
   The Gray Area, a lighter-side section now several years
old, this time includes the "Overconfidence Quiz," which
warns managers that "overconfidence is fairly easy to spot,
except in yourself." The irreverent tone also shows in the
title of one feature, "A Visit From Dr. `No,'" the review's
own nickname for Shintaro Ishihara, the Japanese politician
and critic whose book, "A Japan That Can Say No," heavily
criticizes the U.S. and lobbies for more aggressive Japanese
trade and foreign policy.
   The lead piece in the issue is "Political Advantage:
Japan's Campaign for America," a distillation of a
forthcoming book by Pat Choate, a well-known critic of Japan
and former policy chief for TRW Inc. In the article, Mr.
Choate argues Japan's powerful lobby is distorting U.S.
policy.
   At the behest of Mr. Choate, says managing editor Nan
Stone, the issue is being mailed to every member of Congress.
The review also printed extra copies of the issue,
instructing staff members that if someone calls for a copy of
the piece, they should be sent an entire issue.
   Mr. Choate's piece already scored a prominent mention for
HBR in the Washington Post, where New Republic columnist
Michael Kinsley energetically panned the article earlier this
month.
   "We want to be agenda-setting," says Ms. Kanter. Mr.
Walker, the consultant, says HBR already has influence beyond
its circulation size. It's seen as competing with magazines
such as Foreign Affairs, Atlantic and the New Republic for
the attention of business and government leaders. The Review
also created a mainstream splash last year with the article
that launched the "Mommy Track" debate.
   Ms. Kanter is used to walking the line between scholarly
work and a more popular approach. Her books, such as "When
Giants Learn to Dance," are read well beyond academia, and
she puts up with what she calls "pot shots" from academics
who challenge her seriousness.
   But she says she's comfortable straddling that fence.
"What some of my friends in academia call `popularization,'"
she says, "I call technology transfer."
