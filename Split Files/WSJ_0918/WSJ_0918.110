   NEW YORK -- Pan Am Corp. said it will defer $53 million in
pension-plan payments until November.
   The loss-plagued company, which has had to postpone
pension payments several times in recent years, said it
reached a deferral agreement with the Internal Revenue
Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government
agency that insures pension plans.

   The pact covers payments that Pan Am was supposed to make
on Saturday to the principal pension plan at its Pan American
World Airways unit.
   Pan Am said that on Nov. 1 it will pay $30 million of the
$53 million it owes. If it gets money before then from its
previously announced plan to sell assets, the company said it
agreed to make its payments earlier. Pan Am said it will pay
the remainder of $23 million on Feb. 28, 1991.
   The airline holding company said it will use shares of its
Pan Am Shuttle Inc. unit as collateral for the pension money
it owes.
   Industry observers said the company negotiated the
deferrals because it faces a cash crunch. Pan Am had
cash-on-hand of $100.1 million at June 30, down from $203.9
million at Dec. 31.
