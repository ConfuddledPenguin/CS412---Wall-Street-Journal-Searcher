   Propelled by a weekend of events pointing to the
likelihood of war in the Middle East and possible supply
disruptions, crude oil futures prices soared past the $33 a
barrel mark, setting record highs on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   "This market doesn't want to go down," said Nauman
Barakat, vice president, energy futures, at Merrill Lynch
Consumer Markets. "Even when there is bearish news, the
market seems to be almost immune to it," he said.

   But the past few days have brought little in the way of
bearish news to test his theory, he concedes. On Sunday, the
United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned Iraq's
raids against French, Canadian, Dutch and Belgian embassy
compounds in Kuwait and several countries made moves to expel
Iraqi diplomats in retaliation. Talk of an air traffic
embargo has intensified. President Bush's appearance on Iraqi
television Sunday was met with strong anti-U.S. sentiment
that many analysts said left little room for a nonmilitary
resolution of the crisis spawned by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   When crude oil futures traders started factoring in the
weekend's events yesterday, they annihilated the high of
$32.35 for crude contracts in the seven-year history of the
New York Merc. The October crude contract settled $1.87 a
barrel higher at $33.63, erasing the previous high set in
August 1983.
   The weekend's bullish headlines were aided considerably by
word from President Bush yesterday that he wanted to increase
the size of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve but had
no immediate plans to tap into it to ease a tightness of
crude supplies.
   Also on the supply side, traders attributed part of the
sharp gain to news that the Soviet port of Ventspils would
undergo two to four weeks of long-delayed maintenance
starting Saturday. Some 290,000 barrels of crude oil is
exported from there each day. It was unclear whether that
production will be totally curtailed or simply cut back
during the repairs.
   The New York Merc trading patterns were echoed in London
where the November contract for Brent, a widely traded
benchmark crude, jumped to $33.00 a barrel. In Europe as well
as in the U.S., trading was light. Analysts say sellers are
scarce in this market where so many indicators suggest prices
could go higher. "Any dips in the market bring out a lot of
buyers," Mr. Barakat said.
   The strength in crude carried over into gasoline and
heating oil. Gasoline, which has shown slower gains than
crude recently, added 1.31 cents to the October contract to
settle at 91.67 cents a gallon. The October contract for
heating oil, boosted in part by a huge storage tank fire in
Texas over the weekend, picked up 2.52 cents a gallon to
finish at 85.31 cents. Outer months of crude, gasoline and
heating oil contracts all closed higher, as well.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Futures prices of hogs and cattle
jumped amid signs that consumer demand for red meat continues
to be strong this month. In trading at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the price of the live cattle contract for October
delivery set a life-of-contract high of 79.6 cents a pound
before settling slightly lower at the close. The prices of
contracts for pork bellies, which are used to make bacon,
soared by their maximum daily limit of two cents a pound.
According to Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons, St. Louis, supermarket chains are aggressively stocking
their red meat sections at a time when the weekly production
of red meat is running between 1% and 2% below the 1989 pace.
After the close of trading tomorrow the Agriculture
Department is slated to release its monthly seven-state
survey of cattle feedlots. Feedlots fatten cattle for
slaughter. Traders expect the department to report that the
number of young cattle placed on feedlots in August climbed
3.2% from a year earlier.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose on continued Persian
Gulf tensions and weakness of the dollar. December delivery
gold gained $4.20 an ounce to $395.20, settling just under
the high of the day of $396. December silver advanced 1.6
cents an ounce to $4.8530. October platinum was up $2 an
ounce at $458.90. Gold continued to take its cue from the
strong crude oil market, which was reflecting the Mideast
crisis, but a lack of demand for bullion kept the advance
from being any stronger, an analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices rose. The December contract advanced
$24 a metric ton to $1,326. There is concern over the size of
the West African cocoa crops, an analyst said. The Ivory
Coast, which is in West Africa, is the world's leading cocoa
producer. Heavy rains have come at a time when temperatures
have cooled, making the trees vulnerable to black pod
disease, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman
Brothers. There is strong demand for West African cocoa,
especially that from the Ivory Coast, because it is of high
quality and it isn't as readily available as lesser-quality
types, Ms. Kaul said.
