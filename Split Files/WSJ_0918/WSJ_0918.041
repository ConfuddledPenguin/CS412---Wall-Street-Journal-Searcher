   International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
announced a series of agreements that is likely to reduce
their differences over the direction that personal-computer
software should take.
   IBM said it will license Microsoft's Windows system
software, which gives IBM-compatible PCs a friendlier look
and makes it easier to move from one application program to
another. IBM had been resisting Windows and urging customers
to instead use the OS/2 operating system, a much more
sophisticated piece of software that IBM and Microsoft
developed together. While IBM said it hasn't decided yet
whether it will market the Windows software, it presumably
will, given that Microsoft's latest version of Windows has
been a runaway best seller while OS/2 has been a bust over
its 3 1/2-year life.

   In turn, as expected, Microsoft plans to add to its
product line a version of OS/2 that IBM has been developing
on its own. One of the big complaints about OS/2 has been
that it requires too much memory, which can be expensive. In
response, IBM has developed a version that cuts the memory
requirement in half, to two megabytes. Apparently worried
that such a version could cut into Windows sales, Microsoft
executives had indicated they were leaning against selling
it.
   Also as expected, IBM and Microsoft said they will realign
responsibility for development of OS/2. IBM will take primary
responsibility for the next two main versions of OS/2-one for
machines using the Intel Corp. 80286 microprocessor and one
for machines using the more-powerful 80386 and 80486
processors. Microsoft, Redmond, Wash., will take primary
responsibility for the next version that will be designed for
use on microprocessors other than those in the main Intel
line. The companies said the aim is to make development more
efficient than it is currently.
   IBM, Armonk, N.Y., is still exploring relationships with
many other software companies, and its interests and
Microsoft's diverge enough that they may well run into
further problems. But Jim Cannavino, who runs IBM's PC
business, said in an interview yesterday that "you're going
to find a pretty good working relationship between the two
companies."
   Separately, IBM is announcing today a series of products
that will help users of its AS/400 minicomputers do so-called
computer-integrated manufacturing. The products fill in a few
of the holes in the broad announcement IBM made a year ago on
ways to tie together all parts of a company's design and
manufacturing and to let managers at corporate headquarters
monitor those processes more closely.
   Some of the CIM Series/400 products let IBM's AS/400s
share data with IBM's RS6000 workstations. Others augment
those capabilities for users of design software -- letting
workstation users update their designs automatically by
grabbing information from the companywide data base stored on
the AS/400, or letting AS/400 users check on, say, the
materials being used in a design. The third type of product
uses the AS/400 to manage the design process, helping all the
engineers in a group stay up to date on the latest design
changes and communicating those changes to people involved in
production.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
IBM shares closed at $105.125, up 75 cents. Microsoft shares
rose $1 to close at $60.75 in national over-the-counter
trading.
