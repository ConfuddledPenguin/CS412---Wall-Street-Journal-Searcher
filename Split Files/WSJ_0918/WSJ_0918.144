   MONTREAL -- Workers at eight newsprint mills in Eastern
Canada voted to remain on strike, prompting fears that the
shutdown of about 13% of North American newsprint capacity
will drag on for several weeks or more and send publishers
scrambling for supplies.
   "We'll have a minicrisis on our hands" if the mills are
still out at the end of next week, said James Fitzgerald,
senior vice president at Newsday, the Long Island, N.Y., and
New York City daily. Mr. Fitzgerald buys newsprint for all
Eastern newspapers of Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Co.;
they include Newsday, the Hartford Courant and Baltimore Sun.
He said that while most publishers have at least 30 days
worth of newsprint on hand, "it's amazing how quickly
supplies dwindle."

   Workers walked out at seven Abitibi-Price Inc. mills a
week ago. Six of those mills produce newsprint. Workers went
on strike at two Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd.
newsprint mills last Thursday.
   Together, the closed Abitibi and CP Forest mills have
annual capacity of 2.1 million metric tons, or 13% of North
American newsprint capacity. Also, a strike at a Tribune Co.
unit's mill in Ontario that accounts for just under 2% of
North American capacity is now in its sixth week.
   Publishers in the Northeast U.S. and Eastern Canada would
be hardest hit by an extended strike. Most of the newsprint
usually produced by the closed mills is shipped to customers
in those regions.
   "We have an adequate supply {on hand}, and at this point
it doesn't look too bleak," said Robert Shadrick, director of
operations at Providence Journal Co., a newspaper publisher
based in Providence, R.I. "But you're always concerned when
30% of the newsprint supply {to the region} is taken out of
the market," he added.
   Indirectly the strike may have already cost publishers
tens of millions of dollars. Publishers and many analysts
believe that the threat of a strike at Canadian mills helped
newsprint producers push through a price increase in June.
After discounts, the benchmark Eastern price of newsprint
rose about $30 a metric ton to about $555 a metric ton.
Publishers of U.S. dailies consume over 700,000 metric tons
of newsprint a month.
   It wasn't clear late yesterday if or when talks between
the Canadian Paperworkers Union and the companies would
resume. An Abitibi-Price official said there is "nothing
scheduled." A CP Forest spokesman declined to comment.
   A union official said workers at the striking mills
strongly rejected the last offers from each company. He said
the exact voting results weren't available and declined
further comment. Workers at certain Abitibi and CP Forest
mills aren't on strike and are understood to have accepted
the offers.
   The separate talks between the union and each company
broke off last week, so that the union could hold a vote. The
Abitibi and CP Forest offers are modeled on a contract signed
by workers at Stone Container Corp. mills in Quebec in July.
That contract was supposed to set the pattern for the
remainder of the Eastern Canadian industry. But workers at
some other mills are balking at certain concessions to which
the Stone workers agreed in their contract.
