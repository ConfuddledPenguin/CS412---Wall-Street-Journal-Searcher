   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department launched an effort
designed to ensure that banks fulfill their proxy-voting
duties as trustees for pension plans.
   David Ball, assistant secretary for the Labor Department's
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, said the
department's enforcement division has started a study into
how banks get proxy ballots to trustees and whether the
process gives the shareholders a chance to vote properly. He
said he expects the department inquiry to prompt banks to
review their own policies, thus acting as a self-policing
mechanism.

   "For corporate democracy to work well, persons entitled to
vote need to be able to get relevant information in a timely
fashion and to receive their ballots in time to cast them,"
Mr. Ball said.
   The Labor Department conducted a similar review of
investment managers recently to ensure that they were
managing assets in the interests of plan beneficiaries.
   Mr. Ball said the department's regional offices will
contact major banks in their areas to determine whether the
banks are delivering proxies "in a timely fashion" to pension
plan fiduciaries. The department also will be asking about
the banks' procedures for determining whether the people
voting the shares are the appropriate plan fiduciaries, he
said.
   Mr. Ball also said the Labor Department is considering a
measure that would help beneficiaries determine whether
pension managers have a proxy-voting policy. Currently,
participants can find out about the specific plan's
investments but can't learn much about whether the plan has a
broader policy concerning proxy voting.
