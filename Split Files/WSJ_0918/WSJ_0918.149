   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded its ratings on more
than $1 billion of Itel Corp. debt, citing the increased
leverage that would result from Itel's agreement to buy back
up to 18.7 million common shares from Henley Group Inc.
   S&amp;P downgraded to single-B-minus from single-B its rating
on Itel's $925 million in senior subordinated debentures and
$82.5 million of preferred stock. It also lowered ratings on
$200 million of Itel's Signal Capital Holdings Corp. unit's
senior notes and on debt assumed by Itel Rail of Pullman
Leasing Co. equipment trust certificates and of Trailmobile
Finance Corp. sinking fund debentures.

   S&amp;P said the pending share repurchase from Henley, which
is being financed through asset sales, will increase debt
leverage during an anticipated economic slowdown. Itel said
it had expected the downgradings.
