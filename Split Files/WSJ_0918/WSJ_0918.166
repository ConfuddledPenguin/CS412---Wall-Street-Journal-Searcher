   VeriFone Inc. said that third-quarter earnings would
likely fall short of analysts' estimates, and that it has
implemented cost containment measures in anticipation of
slower revenue growth.
   "Revenue growth in the second half of 1990 hasn't met our
internal expectations," Hatim Tyabji, president and chief
executive officer, said in a prepared statement. He cited
shortages in petroleum and North American emerging businesses
operations, but said the company's financial market and
international operations are continuing to exceed
expectations.
