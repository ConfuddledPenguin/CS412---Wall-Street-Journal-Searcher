   NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp., MCI
Communications Corp. and a small software company said they
formed a company to manage a nationwide computer network for
researchers.
   The announcement, though limited, is an early step in a
broad effort to speed communication among researchers and to
tie many more of them into the network. Sometimes likening
the effort to the building of the interstate highway network
in the 1950s, supporters argue that the data network would
improve the quality of innovation in the U.S.

   IBM, MCI and the software company, Merit Inc., said their
not-for-profit company will manage the federally financed
National Science Foundation Network, an existing network
known as NSFNET. The new company, called Advanced Network &amp;
Service Inc., will also try to improve the services available
to users and expand the network to include more researchers
at universities, federal laboratories and corporations.
   The three parents said the network will provide for
communication at rates as high as 45 million bits of
information a second -- a thirtyfold increase over the
current capability. Down the road, a further fifteenfold
increase will be possible.
   Allan H. Weis, who is leaving IBM to run the new company,
said that companies that use the network will pay a fee,
marking "the first time that industry has stepped up with
green money and supported (the network effort) in a very
visible way."
