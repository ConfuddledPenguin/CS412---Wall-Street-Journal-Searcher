   Skis Rossignol S.A. said it signed a letter of intent to
acquire full control of Roger Cleveland Golf Co. of the U.S.
for an undisclosed amount.
   The French sporting goods group said the acquisition is
aimed at diversifying away from its heavy dependence on
winter ski equipment, for which sales have been hurt by poor
weather conditions in Europe over the past three seasons.

   Roger Cleveland, based in Paramount, Calif., makes
Cleveland Classics brand golf clubs, used largely by
professionals.
   Rossignol, hurt by weak demand for ski equipment and the
relative strength of the franc against key foreign
currencies, had a consolidated loss of 9 million francs ($1.7
million) for the year ended March 31, 1990, on revenue of
1.47 billion francs. A loss of about 85 million francs has
been forecast for the current fiscal year on revenue of about
1.39 billion francs.
   No earnings data was available for the U.S. company.
   Senior officials at Rossignol had indicated recently that
they were close to reaching an agreement to expand into the
fast-growing U.S. golf market, but declined to elaborate at
the time.
