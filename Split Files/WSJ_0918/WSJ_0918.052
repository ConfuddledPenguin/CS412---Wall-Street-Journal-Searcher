   NEW YORK -- Takeover stock traders call it "The Deal from
Hell." Or sometimes, "The Roach Motel: They check in, but
they don't check out." Or even "UAL: United Arbitrage
Liquidation."
   And that's just a sample of the gallows humor.

   The on-again, off-again buy-out of United Airlines parent
UAL Corp. has broken more careers and cost takeover stock
traders more money than any deal in modern Wall Street
history. Losses among traders, known as arbitragers, could
easily exceed $1 billion.
   And the deal refuses to die.
   First a $300-a-share deal for UAL collapsed on Oct. 13,
1989, taking the entire Dow Jones Industrial Average down 190
points in an ensuing panic. Now a $201-a-share bid has
failed. And this week, the UAL pilots are working on an even
lower bid of $175 to $180 a share.
   UAL stock, which peaked at $296, has plunged 30% to 50% in
a matter of days on three separate occasions, falling as low
as $89.50. It closed yesterday at $97.375, down $1.875, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Will it ever end?
   "This stock is like being in a love-hate relationship.
When I buy it, I can't sleep for a week. And when I sell it,
I feel great," one trader said. "Given the scarcity of other
transactions, you're compelled to watch it, even if you don't
want to, because the upside is so compelling."
   UAL-inflicted losses have contributed to the downfall of
several prominent arbitragers, including William Kaye of
PaineWebber Inc., Brian McVeigh of Blackstone Group, Alan
Curtis of Dillon Read &amp; Co. and David Nolan of Spear, Leeds &amp;
Kellogg. While other factors influenced each situation, all
left jobs as their firm's head of arbitrage after losing
money on UAL.
   Some traders accept their losses with a certain macho
swagger.
   "Everybody in the business goes through a tough period;
we're in a tough period, but there will be good times to
follow," says Guy Wyser-Pratt, longtime head of arbitrage of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., which is rumored to have
been holding more than 100,000 UAL shares during some of the
stock's nosedives.
   Mr. Wyser-Pratt confirms that Prudential-Bache owns UAL
shares -- "because we believe in the transaction" -- but he
won't say how many.
   Prudential-Bache aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet agrees that
this is a deal that is going to happen. On Sept. 5, he told
clients a deal for UAL "will be consummated by October" if
there's no shooting in the Middle East. Although few other
analysts agree so wholeheartedly, Mr. Nisbet's comments
contributed to an $8 surge in UAL stock the next day.
   Mr. Wyser-Pratt says that, although he has spoken with Mr.
Nisbet and their two departments do communicate, he didn't
make any effort to influence Mr. Nisbet's views. Mr. Nisbet
recalls Mr. Wyser-Pratt saying this past spring that he
believes a deal will happen. But he said Mr. Wyser-Pratt's
views didn't influence his own.
   The most conspicuous losses in UAL have been suffered by
Coniston Partners, which this past spring threatened to oust
UAL directors in a proxy fight unless they agreed to the
$201-a-share, union-led buyout offer. The New York investment
firm acquired 2.5 million shares, or 11.8% of UAL stock, for
an average disclosed price of $161 a share, after the earlier
UAL deal collapsed.
   In January, when UAL stock fell to $121, leaving Coniston
with paper losses of $100 million, traders were passing
around a California phone number as the new "Coniston hot
line." (The UAL pilots have had a news hot line for union
members throughout the takeover siege.) But callers who
dialed the arbs' number heard only a tape recording of grown
men screaming in agony.
   Few stock market players have admitted to UAL losses on
the scale of Hedged Securities Associates Inc. of Englewood,
Colo. In late August, its founder made a videotaped
confession to investors that he had lost more than $100
million of their money in risky stock options trading
involving UAL. All he had left, he informed investors, was $2
million.
   One of the largest investors in Hedged Securities was
Weyerhaeuser Co. The Tacoma, Wash., paper company entrusted
$22 million in pension money with the firm for what
Weyerhaeuser believed would be a "low-risk hedging strategy."
Saying the matter is "in litigation," Weyerhaeuser wouldn't
comment on why it put pension money, which is supposed to be
invested for the long term, into short-term instruments such
as options.
   Some firms have watched helplessly as the value of their
UAL shares gyrated widely, unable to buy or sell for legal
reasons. Salomon Brothers Inc., one of the advisers to the
United pilots union, held 309,100 UAL shares as of Sept. 21,
1989, when a pilot-management group formally made the
$300-a-share offer.
   Salomon, which acquired the shares before becoming the
union's adviser, may not have been free to sell before the
shares took their first free fall Oct. 13. That's because
Salomon, as an adviser, could have been in a position to
acquire insider information about the deal. Salomon won't say
whether it still owns the stock.
   Every time UAL's stock price has cratered, rumors have
spread that certain arbitrage firms were going out of
business. Kellner, DiLeo &amp; Co. partner George Kellner became
so exasperated with the rumors about his firm last October
that he declared publicly on the Dow Jones News Service that
his firm remained open for business, despite losses in UAL
stock.
   Mr. Kellner says he finds it amusing that so many
arbitragers "claim they never owned the stock." But he says
he finds it "hard to laugh" at any of the UAL jokes.
   Many arbitragers have, in fact, retreated from UAL stock.
At March 31, 1989, institutions owned 81% of UAL shares. By
the end of September, when the stock was near its peak, the
institutional ownership had fallen to 46%, and about a dozen
arbitragers had disclosed holdings of roughly 250,000 shares
apiece. Now many of the arbitragers have reduced their
holdings.
