   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Alltel Corp. said it has put its gas
operations up for sale as part of its strategy to focus on
its main business of telephone communications and data
processing. Stephens Inc. has been retained to assist in the
sale.
   Alltel obtained the gas operations, which serve more than
67,900 customers in California, Oregon and Nevada, as part of
its 1988 acquisition of CP National Corp. of San Francisco.
The gas operations have annual operating revenue of $40
million.
