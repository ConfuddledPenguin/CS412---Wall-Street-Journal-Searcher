   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pandick Inc., a printer of prospectuses,
proxy materials and other financial documents, filed for
bankruptcy-court reorganization, becoming another casualty of
a business slowdown on Wall Street.
   James Alexis, president, attributed the Chapter 11 filing
to the "steady deterioration" of the financial markets since
the October 1987 stock-market crash.

   Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, a company
is protected from creditors while it continues to operate and
tries to reorganize.
   Mr. Alexis said in a statement that Pandick's business has
dropped more than 50% over the past two years. During that
time, the mergers and acquisition business has slowed
markedly and Wall Street firms have cut back sharply.
   The turmoil in the financial markets since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait further curtailed the company's business
and worsened its problems, Mr. Alexis said.
