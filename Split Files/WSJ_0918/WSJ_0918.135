   Caesars World Inc. said an agreement has been reached for
the withdrawal of a petition by a shareholder of Caesars New
Jersey Inc. with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in
connection with Caesars World's pending tender offer for
Caesars New Jersey shares.
   The holder had alleged, among other things, that the $22 a
share Caesars World is offering for the 2.2 million shares of
Caesars New Jersey it doesn't already own was inadequate.
</LP>

   Caesars World said the withdrawal is provided for in an
amendment to its previously announced agreement in principle
connected with the settlement of certain shareholder lawsuits
related to the tender offer. Caesars World holds about 86.6%
of Caesars New Jersey's 16.3 million outstanding shares.
   As a result of the petition withdrawal, a New Jersey
Casino Control Commission hearing on the issue, previously
scheduled for Wednesday, has been adjourned.
