   North Carolina became the third southern state to detect
aflatoxin in its corn crop and, separately, Texas officials
reported discovering the potent carcinogen in raw milk.
   The reports signal that contamination by aflatoxin in the
South might be widespread this year. Last week, Georgia
officials said they blocked sales by an Atlanta milk
processor after detecting aflatoxin in its milk.

   Corn millers and milk processors are strengthening
screening procedures in the wake of the outbreak. So far,
there aren't any reports of aflatoxin in finished goods at
the retail level.
   Crop experts were anticipating an aflatoxin outbreak in
the South this year because severe hot and dry conditions
damaged parts of the corn crop. Aflatoxin is a carcinogen in
laboratory rats and is excreted by a soil fungus under
droughtlike conditions in corn and peanuts, among other
crops.
   Joel Padmore, North Carolina's state chemist, said the
extent of the aflatoxin outbreak there isn't clear. Livestock
farmers have sent about 100 samples of suspicious-looking
corn to state laboratories for testing, and about half have
contained more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per billion. While
most scientists consider that level unsafe for human
consumption, such levels can be consumed by mature hogs and
cattle without tainting their meat.
   Alerted by reports of widespread aflatoxin in Texas corn,
food safety officials there surveyed 44 container trucks of
raw milk in Fort Worth before processing. Aflatoxin was
detected in 19 of the trucks, each of which contained milk
that was produced on many farms in north-central Texas.
   James Fraley of the Texas Department of Health's milk and
dairy products division said that inspectors are screening
the farms that supplied the milk. Because aflatoxin is so
potent, the state can block sales by a dairy farm if its milk
contains more than 0.5 parts of aflatoxin per billion.
   In previous cases of milk contamination, the source of
aflatoxin was often traced back to tainted corn that
unknowingly had been fed to dairy cows. Most dairy farmers
won't feed their cows corn that contains more than 20 parts
of aflatoxin per billion.
   Texas dairy farmers face a difficult time finding safe
corn to feed their animals. Roughly half of the 56 samples of
corn recently surveyed by the state's chemist office
contained more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per billion; and
one sample was at least 55 times the safe level. The corn was
intended for livestock feed.
   Texas officials have also discovered significant levels of
aflatoxin in a handful of 31 sorghum samples.
   Because of the shortage of aflatoxin-free crops, corn
harvested last year in the Midwest is being shipped into
Texas, a state official said.
   Aflatoxin isn't expected to be much of a problem this year
in the Midwest, which produces most of the nation's corn. The
weather through much of the growing season was cool and
abnormally wet.
