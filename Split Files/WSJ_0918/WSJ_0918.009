   WASHINGTON -- Business inventories rose 0.7% in July while
sales fell 0.5%, the Commerce Department reported, another
indication that the economy is vulnerable to recession.
   Economists have been watching inventory levels closely,
fearing that if stockpiles of unsold goods grow too high,
businesses will cut back on orders and production. With the
economy barely growing, the chain reaction could lead to a
recession.

   July's rise in inventories followed a 0.5% decline in
June.
   The figures "are not worrisome in themselves, but taken
with other data seen of late they suggest we are dealing with
an economy that is fragile," said Robert Dederick, chief
economist at Northern Trust Co., Chicago, pointing to recent
declines in retail sales and housing starts and an increase
in the unemployment rate.
   Aubrey Zaffuto, vice president and economist at IBJ
Schroder Bank &amp; Trust Co., New York, predicted there will be
a cut in production to offset the growing inventory figures.
"People are intolerant of small increases in inventories,"
she said.
   Inventories equaled 1.49 months' sales in July, meaning it
would take companies just under a month and a half to sell
off current stocks. This is up slightly from June's figure of
1.47 months but the same figure as in May and is still
considered manageable by most analysts.
   Joan Schneider, senior domestic economist at Continental
Bank National Trust &amp; Co., Chicago, said she saw "nothing
truly alarming" in the July figures. "The inventory-to-sales
ratio is up a little from June but it's not out of line from
the past year," she said.
   Inventories of retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers
totaled $801.94 billion in July, up from $796.47 billion in
June.
   But total sales fell to $539.52 billion from $542.44
billion, the 0.5% decline just about wiping out June's gain
of 0.6%.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
                                                                                                       

   Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on
business inventories and sales in July. The figures are in
