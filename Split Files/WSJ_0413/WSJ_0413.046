   Advertising agencies, focusing on cost control, are
expected to report slightly higher first-quarter earnings,
according to securities analysts.
   Analysts who track Madison Avenue say agencies are
suffering from an environment in which advertisers continue
to spend only modestly, reflecting inflationary fears. Ad
agencies are being forced to live with low revenue growth and
are concentrating on in-house cost-cutting to improve
earnings.

   "Assuming we don't see any structural upheaval in the
industry, I think they're going to have a generally up
quarter," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst at PaineWebber
Inc., New York. He said agencies are closely monitoring
personnel, a major cost that they can control by holding the
line on new hiring.
   Mr. Gottesman and other analysts note, however, that the
first quarter is a minor one in terms of absolute profits.
The first quarter, along with the third quarter, is
traditionally weak. Advertising agencies are most profitable
in the fourth quarter, when clients spend more money in
anticipation of the holidays.
   Mr. Gottesman is projecting first-quarter profit of
Chicago-based Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications Inc. at 30
cents a share, up from 24 cents a share a year earlier.
   "Whatever earnings are eked out will be eked out because
of cost control, not revenue growth," agreed James D.
Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest Securities, New York.
Mr. Dougherty is projecting earnings for New York-based
Omnicom Group at 37 cents a share, up from 33 cents a share a
year earlier. Omnicom is the parent company of the BBDO
Worldwide Inc. and DDB Needham Worldwide Inc. ad agencies.
   Greg Ostroff, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New
York, estimates that earnings for Interpublic Group of Cos.,
parent of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide and Lintas:Worldwide
agencies, will come in at 26 cents a share, up slightly from
24 cents in the year-earlier quarter. "The client companies
haven't been increasing budgets as fast as they have been in
the last few years," Mr. Ostroff said.
   Some analysts are looking for earnings to improve as the
year progresses.
   Mr. Gottesman of PaineWebber said there's good news in
that spending among auto makers looks to be strong, despite
reports to the contrary. "They're talking about retrenching,
but they're not doing it," he said. "There may be some
problems on the local level, but the national ad data
suggests that business seems to be holding up quite well.
That's a plus."
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. and WPP Group PLC, two British
firms, are major players in the advertising business that
don't report quarterly earnings.
