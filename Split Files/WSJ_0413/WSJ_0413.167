   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- A state court here rejected a request
by software company founder Frank H. Dodge to block Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Corp. and its McCormack &amp; Dodge software unit from
interfering with his efforts to start a new concern.
   In rejecting the request for a preliminary injunction,
Justice Peter M. Lauriat of the Superior Court of
Massachusetts said he wasn't persuaded that Mr. Dodge was
likely to prove his claim of interference by Dun &amp;
Bradstreet. He added that he was unconvinced that Mr. Dodge
would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary injunction.

   In addition, Judge Lauriat said, a preliminary injunction
of the scope Mr. Dodge was seeking would "impose a prior
restraint on {Dun &amp; Bradstreet's} protected speech."
   Mr. Dodge had filed a lawsuit contending he was fired
recently without cause by Dun &amp; Bradstreet as president and
chief executive officer of the McCormack &amp; Dodge unit. Thus,
the suit argued, he wasn't bound by an agreement that bars
him from competing against the software company.
   Mr. Dodge and a co-founder sold McCormack &amp; Dodge to Dun &amp;
Bradstreet in 1983, and Mr. Dodge stayed on as president. Dun
&amp; Bradstreet answered that Mr. Dodge resigned and was
therefore subject to the terms of the agreement.
