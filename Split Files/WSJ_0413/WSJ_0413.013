   LONDON -- Hoping to pare staff turnover, a British
supermarket chain recently gave some 70,000 check-out clerks
a 16.5%, one-year pay increase.
   More highly skilled workers, such as elevator technicians,
also are in strong demand. Rail unions have rejected an 8.5%
contract offer, raising concerns that London commuters face a
second summer in a row of occasional transport strikes.

   Britain's labor market is undeniably tight, and it's
likely to remain that way for some time, analysts say.
   A doubling in key interest rates since mid-1988 hasn't
slowed the economy enough to halt job market growth. Now,
with another general election looming by 1992 and the ruling
Conservative Party trailing badly in polls, a further
tightening of monetary policy seems unlikely.
   Because monetary policy is relatively tight, the labor
market's expansion is slowing. But analysts don't anticipate
a sharp rise in unemployment or much moderation in labor
costs.
   "Labor-market pressures are easing, but not enough to push
down wage settlements or earnings," says Don Smith, an
economist at Greenwell Montagu.
   Underlying the strong labor market is a resilient economy.
Britain isn't in danger of recession, even with bank base
rates at a nine-year high of 15%, economists say. As
elsewhere, demographics also affect the job-market outlook.
Because fewer young people will be entering the market,
growth in Britain's work force may decline to just 0.2% in
1992, down from 0.8% last year, according to Greenwell
Montagu.
   Employment growth is slowing, though. Monthly declines in
the jobless total averaged 23,000 a month during the past six
months, about half the average monthly drop in the same
period a year earlier.
   During February, the jobless total fell a mere 1,700, its
smallest monthly decline in four years; in March it dropped
by 6,000. "We probably are some months away from an increase
in unemployment," says John Shepperd, a director of S.G.
Warburg Securities Ltd. "In the near term, it will fall
further."
   Ultimately, sharply rising labor costs will prompt
employers to trim work rolls, economists say. That may be the
case especially in non-manufacturing businesses, which
account for nearly three-fourths of total employment.
   But net job losses this business cycle will be
significantly less than in the last, says Mr. Smith of
Greenwell Montagu.
   He projects the unemployment rate will edge up to only
6.1% next year, compared with February's and March's 5.6%
level, and then begin to fall again. British unemployment
reached a recent peak of 11.3% in 1986.
