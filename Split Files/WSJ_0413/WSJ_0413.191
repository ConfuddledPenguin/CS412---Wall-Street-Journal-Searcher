   Tokyo stocks ended firmer in modest trading, boosted by
index-linked buying in the afternoon session, observers said.
   Shares on most European exchanges also moved up, in the
last day of trading before the Easter holiday weekend.

   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues drifted within a
560-point range throughout the day to close 182.92 points
higher, at 29623.20. The index fell 184.40 points Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was down
378.09 points to 29245.11.
   An estimated 430 million shares changed hands on the first
section Thursday, down from 500 million shares the day
before.
   Despite the Nikkei's gain, declining issues outnumbered
advancing issues 512 to 419, while 170 issues remained
unchanged.
   Reflecting the broad declines, the Tokyo Stock Price Index
of all issues listed in the first section, edged down 1.96
points, to 2183.34. The index fell 0.94 point Wednesday.
   The second section index, which added 13.66 points
Wednesday, added 10.23 points yesterday to close at 3543.85.
Volume was estimated at 10 million shares, up from nine
million Wednesday.
   Morning highs, caused by bargain hunting at the opening,
were met by index-linked selling by institutions, traders
said. Prices then recovered softly at mid-morning, only to be
hit by profit-taking, they added.
   Trading by individual investors was quiet because of
morning volatility on the stock-futures index. In the
afternoon, however, the focus shifted more to fundamentals,
as stabler foreign-exchange rates and relatively steady bond
prices helped give the equity market some reprieve from
recent volatility, observers said.
   "The market's just stabilizing after having some horrible
volatility," said a broker at W.I. Carr, Sons &amp; Co. "It was a
quiet day, but a much more stable day. The market's heaving a
sigh of relief."
   Concern about higher world-wide interest rates is still
weighing heavily on the market, particularly in light of the
West German central bank's conflict with the government
concerning proposed monetary union with East Germany,
observers said.
   The threat of a possible interest-rate rise by the
Bundesbank, which would exacerbate the global trend toward
higher rates, is damaging buying sentiment, one foreign
broker said.
   On the other hand, the recent fall in oil prices,
attributed partly to oversupply by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, is providing a temporary
respite for inflation fears in Japan, the broker said.
   Among electrical and electronics issues, Hitachi was down
40 yen to 1,640 yen ($10.38). It was the most actively traded
issue on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with 26 million shares
trading hands. NEC was down 70 to 2,130, Matsushita Electric
was down 60 to 2,230 and Toshiba was unchanged at 1,100.
   Nippon Steel was down 11 yen to 554, and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries declined 12 yen to 899. A big loser was Honshu
Paper, down 180 yen, or more than 10%, to 1,550.
   Gainers included Casio, up 10 to 1,650; NGK Spark Plug, up
50 to 1,550; and Alps Electric, up 20 to 2,280.
   In Frankfurt, West German share prices jumped 1.3% in an
unexpectedly strong rally on the last day of trading before
the Easter holidays.
   The German Stock Index rallied 24.40 points to end at
1918.17. Trading resumes Tuesday.
   Traders said the market's recovery, which followed six
days of declines, was driven by the major blue-chip stocks,
which had fallen steeply in the past week. The index had
dropped 74.56 points, or 3.8%, since April 3.
   A firming in the bond market also helped, although bonds
finished the day flat. Trading volume was considerably above
levels earlier this week, when the market sagged.
   Traders also cited a relaxing of fears that the currency
union between East and West Germany would be put through over
the week. Rumors to that effect Wednesday were strongly
denied by government and Bundesbank officials.
   Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Bank led the market higher, as
Daimler-Benz shares gained 14 marks to 931 marks ($557) and
Deutsche Bank climbed 19.50 marks to 804. Daimler was aided
by news before the market opened that its Mercedes-Benz car
division posted a 5% increase in unit sales in the important
U.S. market in February and March, against declines for other
European luxury car makers.
   Traders said several rumors about Deutsche Bank helped
push it higher: one, that it is going to reduce its 28%
holding in Daimler-Benz, and another that it is about to
announce a deal with East Germany's Kreditbank.
   Machinery-maker issues, which had been knocked lower
earlier in the week by several sell recommendations from
London, rallied sharply, as Linde soared 30 marks to 1,014
and MAN gained 20.50 marks to 516.50.
   In London, shares finished mostly higher after a generally
thin and lackluster session ahead of the four-day Easter
weekend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished up 6.6 points at 2222.1. The narrower 30-share index
closed up 7.7 points at 1741.0. Volume was 324.5 million
shares, against 311.7 million a day earlier.
   Glaxo Holdings, a major pharmaceutical, posted the
market's biggest gain on the day, surging 24 pence to 814
pence ($13.37) a share on turnover of 6.9 million shares,
also the most active of the major-index stocks. Analysts were
bullish about a new anti-AIDS drug that Glaxo is helping
develop.
   Composite insurers Commercial Union and Guardian Royal
Exchange firmed on market talk of a possible bid for either
company by Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake investment vehicle,
or by French concern Axa-Midi. Mr. Goldsmith and Axa-Midi
were set back by a recent California state regulatory ruling
that would prevent Mr. Goldsmith from selling the Los
Angeles-based Farmers Group insurance unit to Axa-Midi if he
acquires B.A.T Industries. Talk now has turned on a move
against the U.K. composite insurers, which have regularly
featured in takeover talks on the London market. Commercial
Union rose 10 pence to 479, while Royal Guardian added 7 to
225.
   Industrial conglomerate BTR advanced 8 to 422 after a
decision by a U.S. judge to force takeover target Norton, a
U.S. abrasives manufacturer, to hold its annual meeting as
scheduled, allowing BTR to begin a proxy battle.
   Reuters Holdings gained 14 pence to #11.54 on U.S. and
European buying, along with a brief rush to cover short
positions in the face of stock shortages, a dealer said.
   Elsewhere in Europe, Paris share prices continued upward,
closing at new high level in the CAC Index. Prices also
closed higher in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan and Zurich, and
were mixed in Stockholm.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Hong
Kong and Taipei, were mixed in Wellington and Singapore, and
were lower in Seoul and Sydney. Manila was closed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
