   Two tuna canners said they will stop buying and selling
tuna captured along with dolphins, a move long sought by
enviromentalists seeking to protect dolphins from fishing
nets.
   H.J. Heinz Co.'s StarKist Seafood unit said it will no
longer buy tuna caught in a manner that can injure or kill
dolphins. StarKist, the world's largest tuna canner, said it
was responding to consumer concerns over dolphin safety.

   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. followed suit a short time later.
It told the Associated Press that it "would now implement its
plan to end the purchase of tuna caught in association with
dolphin."
   "Our tuna cans will begin to reflect the dolphin-safe
label in U.S. stores within the next three months," the San
Diego-based company's statement said.
   A third tuna canner, Van Kamp Seafood of St. Louis, which
sells the Chicken of the Sea brand, said it would make
"further enhancements to its established campaign for the
protection and preservation of dolphins."
   Pittsburgh-based Heinz had come under fire from
environmentalists who say 100,000 dolphins are killed each
year in nets set to capture tuna, specifically in the Pacific
Ocean from Chile to Southern California. Earlier this week,
in another gesture to environmentalists, Heinz unveiled plans
for a recyclable plastic ketchup bottle.
   StarKist said 90% of the 250,000 tons of tuna it buys each
year is already "dolphin safe," but now it will only buy tuna
from boats in which government observers have certified no
dolphins were killed.
   StarKist said it will have to buy some of its tuna from
other oceans, which will increase costs. But it said that
would have little effect on price.
   Environmentalists praised the latest announcement.
"They've really taken the lead on this and gone beyond what
we expected," said Blair Palese, spokesperson for Greenpeace,
an environmental group.
   Representatives of the nation's tuna fishing fleet,
however, called the move "a political response to a
scientific issue" that would do little to save the lives of
dolphins, and said it could "severely impact, if not destroy,
the U.S. tuna fleet."
   For years, most tuna have been caught by boats that cast
their nets around the herds of dolphins that generally swim
above the fish. Fishermen then push the dolphins out and
harvest the fish, although dolphins can die if they become
tangled in the nets.
   August Felando, president of the American Tunaboat
Association, said that dolphins will continue to be encircled
by foreign boats seeking the larger yellowfin tuna that swim
beneath. "Foreign boats, which operate free of stringent U.S.
quotas (for killing dolphins) will simply sell their catch to
a growing European market and elsewhere," he said.
