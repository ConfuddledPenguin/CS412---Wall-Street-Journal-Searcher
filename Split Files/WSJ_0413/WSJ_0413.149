   American Realty Trust Inc. said in Dallas that its board
adopted a preferred share-purchase rights plan intended to
deter a hostile takeover.
   The real estate investment trust controlled by Gene E.
Phillips and William S. Friedman, former top executives of
Southmark Corp., said the plan wasn't adopted in response to
an effort to acquire the company. It also said it doesn't
know of efforts to acquire the concern.

   Terms of the anti-takeover plan call for preferred
share-purchase rights to be distributed on April 23 to shares
of record on that date. If a hostile suitor increases his
stake in American Realty by more than 25% or if the company's
board decides that a holder of 10% or more of the stock is
hurting the company's business, the rights will allow
shareholders other than the hostile buyer to buy American
Realty stock at half-price.
