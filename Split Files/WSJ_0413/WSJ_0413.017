   MOSCOW -- Mikhail Gorbachev and his advisers are
considering far-reaching economic changes that would remove
government control from 70% of the Soviet economy now
dominated by the state, drastically curb central planning and
raise most prices by an average 100%, a leading economist
says.
   The report comes from Pavel Bunich, an economist in
Parliament who is helping to write the plan. But after weeks
of speculation over what kinds of radical changes Mr.
Gorbachev intends in order to create a market economy, Mr.
Bunich said the package of proposals still contains many
murky areas and isn't final.

   "There is nothing like `yes' or `no' in that package," Mr.
Bunich explained at a news conference yesterday. "Some of it
is so porous it's impossible to say whether the government
agrees or not."
   Mr. Gorbachev's newly created council of presidential
advisers is scheduled to meet this weekend to discuss the
package, and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov will present it
to Parliament later this month, Mr. Bunich said. Parliament
will act on the new laws in its current session or at its
next one. Mr. Bunich said he hopes the first reforms are in
place by the start of 1991.
   Mr. Bunich didn't provide a timetable but said many
changes would occur after 1991 and that some would bypass
Parliament to be enacted by decree. He said he didn't expect
any of the measures to be enforced by Mr. Gorbachev using his
new presidential powers.
   The basic points of the program include a market-oriented
economy, a new pricing mechanism, and laws to permit economic
activities free of government control, Mr. Bunich said.
Though only at an "embryonic stage" now, the package also
considers creating competition, a law to control unemployment
and the indexation of incomes to compensate for higher
prices.
   Mr. Bunich said he expects unemployment to rise to 10
million, or about 7% of the work force, during the
transition. Officially, the Soviet Union doesn't have
unemployment, but unofficial estimates put the number of
people without jobs at about two million. The new laws will
contain some measures to combat unemployment, Mr. Bunich
said. He didn't specify what form this would take, but others
familiar with the package have mentioned job-training and
unemployment benefits.
   Huge state industrial monopolies will be broken up and
leased to work collectives or sold to individual owners, Mr.
Bunich said. Some leasing of state-owned enterprises began
under a law passed last December. Mr. Bunich didn't explain
how it would be accelerated or expanded to eliminate
government control of 70% of the public sector.
   Free-market competition, he said, would have to evolve
slowly. The government could encourage it by splitting up
some large sectors, he said. For example, Aeroflot, the
Soviet national airline and biggest airline in the world,
could be broken into three companies, he said. Other
officials say that anti-monopoly legislation is also part of
the package. And the government is likely to further punish
big organizations by introducing a supertax on their profits.
   Mr. Bunich said that when 70% of the public sector turns
private, 70% of the government will no longer be needed, and
the ministries, as they exist now, "will be meaningless." He
said he didn't think it was necessary to preserve them,
except in some sort of advisory capacity in areas that will
remain government-regulated, such as space and defense.
   The two main planning agencies that control most of the
economy are also likely to undergo transformation. Gossnab,
the mammoth state agency that runs all wholesale trade, "must
not look like the current octopus," Mr. Bunich said. He also
said he "no longer sees the necessity for preserving that
supergiant Gosplan," the state planning commission, or its
five-year plans. Some officials say planning may be retained
for a few key strategic items.
   "The sooner we realize that the administrative top
(bureaucracy) isn't only expensive, but in the way of reform,
the sooner we will have reform," Mr. Bunich said.
   Final details of the price increases must be approved by
Parliament, and Mr. Bunich said his figure of 100% increases
was only a "rough estimate." The price increases will affect
retail and wholesale goods comprising about 70% of the
economy. The government is likely to continue to set prices
for the other 30%, so-called strategic goods that it buys for
defense, space and energy.
