   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Israel ordered 18 AH-64A
helicopters for $150 million. But the St. Louis-based
aerospace and defense company also said that Egypt is
considering buying 24 of the Apache attack helicopters and
that the Israeli purchase shouldn't tilt the Mideast balance
of power.
   McDonnell Douglas said that Israel is the first
international customer for the AH-64A, and that the order
will be completed as a foreign military sale with the U.S.
government. It said the sale will provide the Israeli air
force with "a stand-off weapon system with an anti-armor, day
and night missile capability."

   The first of the aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to
the Israelis during the 1990 third quarter. Several other
nations in the Middle East, Europe and the Far East have
expressed interest in buying Apaches for their own defense,
McDonnell Douglas said. A spokesman said that prior to the
Israeli purchase, the U.S. Army has ordered 807 of the
helicopters since their production began in 1983.
