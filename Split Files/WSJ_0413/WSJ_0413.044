   To any taxpayers who've been audited, the Internal Revenue
Service is a frightening behemoth that can shatter your peace
of mind and balloon your tax bill.
   In "A Law Unto Itself: Power, Politics and the IRS"
(Random House, 419 pages, $22.50), author David Burnham
provides copious details on how the IRS, with its 123,000
employees, keeps tabs on the nation's 152 million taxpayers
who fork up $1 trillion a year to pay ever-increasing
government bills. And almost four million IRS notices assess
an added $1.8 billion a year on underreported income.

   Some stories about IRS assessments are terrifying. Take
the Husbys of San Francisco, who were asked for added taxes
in 1986. The couple took the case to Tax Court, but a
computerized IRS service center in Ogdon, Utah, still
demanded payment.
   The Husbys' attorney complained, saying the petition to
the Tax Court made the second IRS demand illegal. But a third
arrived, then two more.
   A year later, an IRS notice of levy was sent to the credit
union of the police department from which Mr. Husby had
retired, seizing almost $3,800. Another notice was served on
the couple's stockbroker. Even after a federal judge enjoined
the IRS from further notices, a tax lien wound up in public
files. Credit for the couple dried up.
   The IRS contended that it wasn't liable for its computers'
mistakes since such errors rarely occur. But Mr. Burnham says
such IRS computer errors "continue to affect an unknown
number of other taxpayers."
   Bureaucratic gaffes apparently are more common than the
IRS would like the public to believe. For example, this
reviewer recently wrote in this newspaper about an accountant
who was enrolled by an overzealous IRS agent to inform on his
client for five years -- to the outrage of other accountants
who fear this disclosure may lose them tax clients. The
accountant had failed to pay his own taxes but was never
prosecuted.
   The IRS sometimes ends up wasting its efforts and funds on
seemingly nonproductive targets, according to Mr. Burnham, a
former investigative reporter for the New York Times.
Consider that the service had to take a Billings, Mont.,
taxpayer to an appeals court before it could collect an extra
$500 assessment. The taxpayer apparently had violated an
obscure section of the tax law prohibiting "frivolous"
comment on the return. The scribbled comment: "Signed
involuntarily under the penalty of statutory punishment."
   Mr. Burnham is at his best relating anecdotes about
government ineptitude, incompetence or pigheadedness. But his
book bogs down when it strings out barely related facts. For
example, most readers may find it hard to resist yawning when
Mr. Burnham tells how the IRS and state organizations
exchange tax data.
   Even in some of its most gripping sections, the book tends
to be skimpy on certain key details. For example, it relates
how the IRS began investigating the National Council of
Churches in the late 1960s because of its civil-rights and
anti-Vietnam War activities.
   The investigation ended in 1972 but not until the
council's business records for at least three years were
scrutinized by the IRS. The church group told Mr. Burnham
that "a particular conservative senator," disturbed at the
council's political stands, had gotten the IRS to harass the
council. The senator isn't identified nor does the reader
learn how he got the IRS to do his handiwork. As it turns
out, the IRS concluded that only 8% of the council's funds
had been used for allegedly non-tax-exempt activities. And
this didn't justify raising the council's tax bill.
   IRS attempts to enforce evenhanded treatment of tax-exempt
and religious organizations have been less than fruitful,
according to Mr. Burnham. For example, pro-choice groups have
long contended that the Catholic Church has avoided IRS tax
penalties despite its spending funds to oppose abortion -- a
political activity that the groups say shouldn't be
tax-exempt under the law. But Mr. Burnham says that "given
the power of the Roman Catholic Church, it is inconceivable
that the IRS would revoke its tax-exempt status, no matter
what it did."
   Individual taxpayers, on the other hand, often fall into
the trap of thinking the IRS loves them too, because they
mistakenly see their tax refunds as a gift instead of a
byproduct of overwithholding. Mr. Burnham notes, for example,
that in a recent year, the IRS paid out an average of $800 to
four out of five individual taxpayers. Adds Mr. Burnham:
"Because the withholding process is almost invisible, and the
refund check so visible . . . a substantial number of
taxpayers gradually have abandoned the essentially correct
picture of the agency as a hard-nosed tax collector and have
adopted the false view that the IRS is a benevolent
bureaucracy that gives away money to the needy middle class."
   Although Mr. Burnham doesn't flesh out some sections of
his book enough, the reader will still find it hard to put
down once he's begun. As tax day approaches next week, we all
want to know more about the agency that pinches our
pocketbook.
