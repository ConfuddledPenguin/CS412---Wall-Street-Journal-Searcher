   CORNING Inc. has not filed a patent infringement suit
against SpecTran Corp., a maker of optical fibers. An earlier
edition incorrectly reported that Corning had filed such a
suit to protect infringements against its optical fiber
patents.

   BROWNING-FERRIS INDUSTRIES Inc. is pulling out of the
hazardous waste treatment and disposal business and is
closing or attempting to sell its hazardous-waste landfills.
An earlier edition reported that the company was leaving the
landfill business entirely. Browning-Ferris continues to
operate solid-waste landfills.
