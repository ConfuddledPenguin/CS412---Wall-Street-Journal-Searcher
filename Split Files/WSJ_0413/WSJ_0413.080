   For years, I've watched TV network correspondents as they
stand forlornly in the driveway outside the White House,
reporting with almost pathetic panache whatever scraps of
information can be gleaned from inside, usually from some
mysterious individual named "Sources."
   Night after night, in winter cold, summer heat and
constant carbon monoxide they keep their lonely vigils, and
not just in the White House driveway but in similarly swell
driveways all over Washington; State Department, Pentagon,
Justice, you name it. From these limousine limbos they
breathlessly pass along whatever "Sources" has confided that
particular day.

   All of this gives rise to some troubling questions that
might even call for a congressional investigation, since the
TV gang in the Capitol Hill driveway also churn out no end of
tidbits slipped to them by "Sources."
   Why are these free-born Americans confined (I would assume
against their wills) to federal driveways? Why are they kept
outside like pets that have never been housebroken? Besides
the civil-rights implications of their non-admittance, the
practice seems downright inhumane.
   Imagine the demeaning way these obviously sensitive souls
must spend their days -- making forced conversation with
bored chauffeurs waiting to pick up VIPs, being shooed off
the grass by groundskeepers when they absent-mindedly wander
off the asphalt, lost in bitter self-reproach as they recall
lost opportunities to become chiropractors or undertakers.
   But the most troubling questions derive from the
apparently all-pervasive power of "Sources" to control
information flowing from the nation's capital. Since there
must be many "Sources," is this some new Mafioso-type family
specializing not in loan sharking, numbers or protection, but
in news dissemination?
   Once in a while we hear of "Authoritative" or "Reliable"
Sources, but there have to be other members of the clan.
Somewhere behind all those federal facades there must be a
Bill Sources, Herb Sources, Doris, Noreen, Hank or even Frank
Sources; but Sources all.
   Let's get all these Sources outside in the light of day
and find out who they. At the same time we can let those TV
talkers inside. It's only right and besides, with no Sources,
what harm can they do?
