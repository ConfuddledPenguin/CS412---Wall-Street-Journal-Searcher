   MOSCOW -- Despite its economic shortcomings, the Soviet
Union has insisted for decades that its socialist system is
superior to capitalism in at least two respects: guaranteed
jobs and low prices.
   But as Mikhail Gorbachev moves toward what he calls a
"regulated market economy," this longstanding social contract
with the Soviet people is about to be broken. Officials say
the new Soviet economic package, due later this month, will
inevitably bring mass unemployment and big price increases
for basic goods.

   Government economists insist that the changes are vital to
halt the economy's slide and bring about lasting
improvements. But as many admit, the crucial unanswered
question is whether the Soviet public is willing to pay such
a price, especially in the short term. If they aren't, the
already beleaguered President Gorbachev could face the
toughest challenge of his five years in office.
   "An explosion will occur that {the government} doesn't
expect," predicts Alexei Sergeyev, an economist who teaches
at the Labor Unions' Higher School. He warns that mass
strikes and social unrest could quickly erupt. "People will
initially say it's OK {to change to a market economy} as long
as it makes life better. But as soon as they see it
translates into millions of unemployed and price increases
without compensation, they'll say no."
   Even government economists who are drafting the new plans
echo some of Mr. Sergeyev's fears. They concede that their
biggest problem is devising measures to cushion the impact of
an economic overhaul that won't render the whole package
ineffective.
   "Any radical reform needs certain agreement among social
forces," says Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime minister and key
architect of the new legislation. He and other economists say
the package will include provisions such as index-linked
social benefits and unemployment insurance.
   Because of fears of social upheaval, it will be softer and
slower than Poland's economic "shock therapy." Mr. Abalkin
worries that after five years perestroika and broken promises
of a better life, the government "doesn't have the trust of
the people." But he insists: "We shouldn't back down in the
face of disagreement or resentment."
   The greatest threat to the reforms is likely to come from
Soviet workers. Even before they are faced with the prospect
of unemployment, workers in many parts of the country are
furious about dwindling supplies of food and consumer goods.
   This month, oil field workers in Western Siberia
threatened to strike in protest against chronic housing
shortages and poor living standards. The strike was postponed
after Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov met with them to calm
their anger. But labor officials say the crisis is far from
over.
   Coal miners in Siberia and the Ukraine are also
increasingly militant. They complain the government hasn't
delivered many of the improvements it promised last year when
it settled a nationwide miners' strike. Mr. Sergeyev, who
recently visited coal fields in Siberia, says the miners are
talking about new strikes. "The situation is very tense," he
says.
   To head off potential unrest that could cripple
implementation of his reforms, several government officials
say Mr. Gorbachev may ban strikes. If he does, it is
uncertain how he would enforce it. Such a move could alienate
the huge official labor movement, which is urgently seeking
to regain its credibility with workers. Some officials are
concerned that the labor unions may seize on the economic
overhaul as a way to strengthen their political authority.
   So far, labor representatives won't talk publicly about
their plans. But, "last September we took a decision to
defend workers," says Pyotr Fyodorov, a senior official at
the unions' headquarters in Moscow. "In the past, labor
unions were linked to defending and implementing {the
nation's economic} plans, and people got lost. We now say
that isn't right."
   The unions have already shown their clout by forcing the
government to retract price rises on diesel fuel, freight and
electricity supplies to industry that were supposed to begin
at the beginning of this year. They have also persuaded the
government to scale down its plans to sell many goods in
short supply at auctions.
   To assuage the unions, Mr. Gorbachev has included one of
the most militant labor officials, Veniamin Yarin, on his
council of presidential advisers, which plays a big role in
setting the reforms.
   Mr. Gorbachev may also face trouble pushing his measures
through parliament. It has already rejected planned price
increases on beer and cigarettes. Pavel Bunich, a legislator
and economist, says "resistance will be there," when the
parliament debates the government's new program, though he
believes a majority will approve it.
   Raising prices is a particularly sensitive issue in the
Soviet Union because the cost of many consumer goods and
foodstuffs has remained unchanged for years, sometimes
decades. The government now spends about $160 billion a year
on subsidies. The economic distortions are enormous: The
retail price of meat is about half the cost of the grain that
is fed to cattle, for example.
   Even if it makes economic sense, adjusting prices will be
extremely hard on people long used to being told that stable
prices are a fundamental human right. "For their whole life,
people have believed that meat should cost two rubles per
kilo, and if the state charges 15 rubles it will be a shock,"
says Alexei Slavich-Pristupa, a reform economist. "It isn't
important that meat can be bought twice a week or every day.
It's just important that it costs two rubles."
