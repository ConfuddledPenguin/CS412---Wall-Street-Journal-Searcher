   LONDON -- Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group SmithKline
Beecham PLC said it has agreed to sell its U.K.-based
Yardley-Lentheric Cosmetics business to Old Bond Street Corp.
of the U.S. for #110 million ($180.7 million).
   Although shareholder approval has been obtained, the deal
still requires both U.S. and U.K. regulatory approvals, tax
clearances and proof of financing by Old Bond Street, a
company spokesman said.

   Proceeds from the disposal -- part of SmithKline's
strategy to focus on its core healthcare business following
its creation last year from the merger of Beecham Group PLC
and the SmithKline Beckman Corp. -- will be put toward
trimming debt, SmithKline said.
   The sale represents the first disposal of a cosmetics unit
since the merger. Negotiations are under way with possible
buyers of the remaining cosmetics divisions, which include
Yardley-Lentheric operations in South Africa and the
SmithKline Beecham Astor-Lancaster businesses in continental
Europe, the spokesman said.
   Old Bond Street, a holding company, plans to pay for the
cosmetics unit with a combination of cash and debt,
SmithKline said. Additionally, the U.K. company will hold a
10% stake in Old Bond Street, it added.
   SmithKline's spokesman said he didn't know when the deal
might be completed.
