   STRIKE: A chapter of the International Alliance of
Theatrical Stage Employees struck CBS Inc. in New York. About
200 members of the union's Local 1, representing stagehands
on newscasts and other programs on WCBS-TV and the CBS-TV
network, walked off their jobs yesterday. The previous
contract expired Dec. 31.
