   NEW YORK -- Crowthers McCall Pattern Inc. said it reached
a definitive agreement to be acquired by a Philadelphia
investment partnership for $45 million.
   Although the agreement advances reorganization efforts by
McCall, which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
proceedings since December 1988, the pact leaves open the
question of how claims of creditors, who are owed $64.4
million, will be satisfied. The purchase agreement, with
Dimeling &amp; Schreiber's MP Holdings Inc., is for all of the
assets of McCall, a maker of home-sewing patterns. McCall
intends to use the proceeds to pay for its reorganization
plan.

   An attorney for McCall creditors said the creditors expect
to make up the difference between the purchase price and the
debt through a $60 million lawsuit that is pending against
Reginald F. Lewis, an investor with a 20% equity stake in
McCall. Mr. Lewis led a group that purchased McCall Pattern
Co. in 1984 for $24.5 million. The group sold McCall for $63
million in June 1987 to an investor group controlled by John
Crowther PLC, a British textile company that was taken over
by Coloroll Group PLC.
   In September, McCall sued Mr. Lewis and others, including
Shearson Lehman Brothers Group Inc. and a unit of Bankers
Trust New York Corp. McCall charged that Mr. Lewis's highly
leveraged purchase and sale of the company triggered its
bankruptcy-law filing. Mr. Lewis also is the subject of a
pending suit by Travelers Insurance Co., a unit of Travelers
Corp., seeking $35 million in damages from a senior note on
which Crowthers McCall defaulted in 1988.
   As part of the agreement with MP Holdings, members of
McCall's management will acquire an equity stake, the size of
which officials didn't disclose. Bankruptcy court has
approved a breakup fee if McCall accepts a competing bid and
gives MP Holdings the right to change its offer if McCall's
receives competing bids. MP Holdings posted a $2 million
deposit.
