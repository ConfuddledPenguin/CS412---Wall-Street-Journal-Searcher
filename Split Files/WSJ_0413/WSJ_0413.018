   RIO DE JANEIRO -- President Fernando Collor de Mello won a
major victory as Brazil's Congress approved the central
elements of his bold anti-inflation plan, including a squeeze
on the circulation of money.
   But Mr. Collor's success in his battle with Congress may
have been the easy part. Now that he has a free hand, Mr.
Collor faces the challenge of finding a way to soften the
plan's recessionary effects without triggering a new wave of
inflation.

   "The situation in Congress looked pretty messy and what he
did is pretty extraordinary," said a diplomat who followed
the process closely. "But administering this thing will be a
challenge and a half. He has to fine-tune monetary policy,
cut spending and balance the budget in the face of a possibly
deep recession."
   Mr. Collor's biggest victory in the fight with Congress,
which has been voting on the plan measure by measure for nine
days, came early Thursday when it unexpectedly approved by a
slim margin the program's centerpiece: an 18-month freeze on
about 80% of the money in circulation in the Brazilian
economy, estimated at about $115 billion.
   The government achieved this freeze, believed to be one of
the biggest liquidity squeezes in history, by bottling up all
funds in excess of 50,000 cruzeiros ($1,052) in savings and
checking accounts for 18 months, to be redeemed in 12 monthly
installments with 6% interest. The government also limited
withdrawals from the overnight market, a one-day savings
account in which about $60 billion was invested as a hedge
against inflation; capped withdrawals from interest-bearing
accounts to 20,000 cruzeiros or 25% of total funds, whichever
is highest; and limited withdrawals from money-market
accounts to 20%.
   By deliberately starving the economy of cash, the
government is seeking to prevent the boom in consumer demand
that accompanied previous anti-inflation plans here and curb
spending when price and wage controls are lifted. But the
freeze has brought to a standstill large parts of the
Brazilian economy, including the automobile and construction
industries, and many feel the government has simply replaced
high inflation with deep recession. Industrial production
fell by 14.7% in March, according to the National
Confederation of Industry, and many companies, deprived both
of working capital and cash flow, have had to borrow money to
pay wages, temporarily lay off workers or even close down.
   In a bid to soften the plan's impact, the center-right
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the largest in Congress
with 179 of 570 seats, sought to push through an amendment
significantly raising the ceiling on withdrawals from the
frozen funds. But 51 Democratic Movement deputies broke ranks
with their own party and voted down the proposal, ensuring
the approval of Mr. Collor's original text by a 249-206
margin. "I am extremely satisfied with the result of the
session in Congress," Mr. Collor said.
   If that was his most important victory, it wasn't his only
one. Almost all the most important of the 20-odd measures he
submitted to Congress have been approved, although sometimes
with minor modifications. Key measures approved include the
closure of 23 state institutions, new taxes on financial
transactions, and authorization to sell off many of Brazil's
188 state-run companies, which have a combined deficit of $62
billion.
   But in approving the privatization plan, Congress
prohibited the sale of Banco do Brasil, the country's largest
commercial bank, Petrobras, the state oil company, Embratel,
the national telecommunications giant, the postal service and
national development banks. Congress also limited foreign
ownership to 49% and a maximum of 40% of voting capital.
Congress also decided that any debt-for-equity swaps in the
privatization process will be governed by a separate law.
   With the major planks of his plan now approved, attention
is shifting to how Mr. Collor will succeed in avoiding too
deep a recession, or even a depression. Analysts now expect
the government to announce measures to boost the automobile,
construction and other capital-goods industries and promote
exports, which have been paralyzed. The central bank earlier
this week effectively devalued the cruzeiro against the
dollar by about 5%. The dollar is now worth about 47
cruzeiros on the official market.
