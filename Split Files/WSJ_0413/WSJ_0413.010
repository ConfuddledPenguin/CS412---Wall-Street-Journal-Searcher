   Apparel companies will be reporting depressed
first-quarter results in the next weeks, reflecting a
cautious climate in which wary retailers are ordering later
and more conservatively.
   Analysts say first-quarter results will vary widely across
the apparel sector, with "some companies benefiting from
retail sales that were better-than-expected, partly due to
warm weather," and fewer markdowns, said Elizabeth Armstrong,
an analyst at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben Inc. But the combined
effects of more retailers placing their orders later,
less-than-buoyant retail sales and other factors have hurt
earnings at many companies. Ms. Armstrong predicts
first-quarter net income at the 16 apparel companies she
follows will be down about 17% from a year earlier.

   "In the first quarter, sluggishness was apparent in most
areas of textiles and apparel fabrics, which we think will
have a domino effect on the apparel companies," said Josie
Esquivel, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The strongest first-quarter gains are coming from the
usual solid performers. Analysts estimate Liz Claiborne will
post a profit gain of at least 15%, while Nike Corp. will see
an increase of about 50%.
   Reebok International, analysts say, should report about a
10% rise in profit. Analysts point out that, unlike some
apparel makers, all three of those companies already have
strong fall order backlogs. Analysts also expect
first-quarter gains from Russell Corp. and Crystal Brands
Inc.
   But there are a number of apparel companies that are
"struggling to stay even -- at best -- with last year," says
Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
Analysts expect first-quarter losses at Phillips Van Heusen
Corp. and Bernard Chaus Inc., and they project flat quarterly
results at Leslie Fay Co. and Oskosh B'Gosh Inc.
   Most apparel companies are seeing increasingly fragmented
ordering patterns from retailers, which are worried about
getting stuck with too much inventory. Too much inventory
could force them into heavy markdowns and lower profits. As a
result, retailers have been ordering very conservatively. In
the first quarter, "advance orders are way down," from a year
earlier, Ms. Esquivel said.
   Hartmarx Corp., suffering from the slump in the sales of
retail and wholesale menswear, already reported a 75% plunge
in first-quarter earnings. And VF Corp. disclosed that it
expects first-quarter profit to drop about 35% from a year
earlier. VF's results will include a pretax charge of more
than $3 million from closing two plants at its Lee Co.
jeanswear division.
   The troubled retail operations of Campeau Corp., operating
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January,
continue to depress business for apparel makers. "Campeau as
a negative has lessened to a degree," Ms. Armstrong says, but
there are some apparel companies that are shipping Campeau
stores "less than they normally would."
