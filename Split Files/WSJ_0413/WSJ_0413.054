   CINCINNATI -- Midland Co.'s chairman, J.P. Hayden Jr.,
said first-quarter earnings were "significantly less" than
last year's quarter.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Midland had net income of
$3,050,000, or 91 cents a share. Revenue was $37,374,000.

   Mr. Hayden said the company's property and casualty
operations experienced heavier than normal weather-related
losses, due to severe weather in Alabama and Mississippi in
February and March.
   In addition, flooding along the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers and their tributaries hurt the company's barge
operations.
   The company, a diversified insurance, finance and
transportation concern, expects to report first-quarter
results in about three weeks.
