   World oil markets calmed, if only briefly, as the oil
ministers of OPEC tried again to "talk up" the price of
petroleum.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
announced that the ministers were considering an emergency
meeting to deal with the oil glut if the oil market
deteriorated further.

   On that official word from OPEC, prices of North Sea
crudes rose as much as 55 cents a barrel in European spot
markets. In the U.S. futures market, where crude had firmed
sharply on Wednesday's rumors of a possible OPEC meeting
soon, prices were up and down during the day but closed
lower. The swings, however, were relatively narrow compared
with the volatile pricing action earlier in the week.
   In thin trading in advance of the three-day Easter
holiday, West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery
declined 28 cents a barrel to settle at $17.78. The June
crude contract was down 21 cents to $18.51. Other fuels
futures were mixed, although gasoline showed big drops of as
much as one cent a gallon.
   The OPEC announcement, released at its headquarters in
Vienna, quoted the acting president, Sadek Boussena of
Algeria, as saying the ministers were considering "various
options" to halt the slide in oil prices. Among the options,
according to Mr. Boussena, were "an urgent meeting of the
eight-member ministerial monitoring committee and an
extraordinary meeting of the conference."
   Until yesterday, OPEC officials still were debating
whether there would be time -- or the need -- to try to work
in a special meeting of the 13 ministers before the midyear
conference already set to begin May 25. The ministerial
monitoring committee, which reviews world oil markets, had
scheduled its next meeting two days ahead of the official
conference. That influential committee can only recommend
OPEC actions, but its sessions often attract all 13 ministers
and can quickly evolve into full meetings.
   Still, as crude oil prices plunged in wild trading this
week -- dropping $1.48 a barrel in 40 minutes before
rebounding Wednesday morning on the New York Mercantile
Exchange -- leading oil ministers grew increasingly worried.
They launched a frantic round of phone calls to try to come
to terms on something to firm the market.
   "The deterioration of prices has been observed with
alarm," said a senior OPEC official involved in the talks.
Discussions will continue through the weekend, he added,
noting that European markets will be closed Monday for the
Easter weekend, thus giving OPEC another day's breathing
room.
   The official said no decision would be taken on a new
meeting date earlier than Tuesday. If by then "production has
dropped or the price has increased, there will be no
meeting," he said. "But if the situation hasn't improved," he
added, "there will be a meeting -- by April 22 or 23 at the
latest."
   In the statement released by OPEC yesterday afternoon
Vienna time, Mr. Boussena said he had been in intense
consultations with his colleagues "with a view to taking the
necessary corrective steps to arrest the present slide and
reverse the trend of steady price decline witnessed since
January."
   In the talks, Mr. Boussena said he had "noted, with
satisfaction, the clear commitment to the minimum reference
price of $18 per barrel for the OPEC basket and the
willingness to act responsibly in order to safeguard the
stability of the oil market and restore prices to the agreed
level."
   OPEC's first-half production agreement provides for a
production ceiling of 22 million barrels a day and a minimum
reference price of $18 a barrel. OPEC bases its reference on
a basket of seven crudes.
   The basket average reached $19 a barrel early this year,
but now is near $17. Some individual crudes have fallen even
more -- as much as $6 a barrel. The big factor is high OPEC
output of 24 million barrels a day during this seasonally
slack period for oil demand.
   All OPEC nations able to produce above their quotas,
including kingpin Saudi Arabia, seem to be doing so. But
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates still are said to be the
chief quota violators.
   Even so, Mana Said Otaiba, the oil minister of the
Emirates, joined in the chorus of complaints from OPEC about
the slide in oil prices. "There is a fixed red line which oil
prices should not fall behind," he said, according to the
Emirates' news agency.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures contracts moved in narrow ranges
in featureless pre-holiday trading. June-delivery gold rose
$1.30 an ounce, to $379.70. May silver finished four cents
lower, at $5.1080 an ounce. July platinum ended the session
$1.70 higher, at $486.50 an ounce. William O'Neill, research
director for Elders Futures, New York, said the metals seem
to be in league with the dollar and are ignoring the wild
goings-on in the energy market. But he said, "If crude
weakens and crashes through the recent lows, it can't help
but have a negative impact on the precious metals because of
the deflationary implications." Mr. O'Neill pointed out that
recent economic numbers don't reflect a very strong economy,
and that "this could cause the Federal Reserve Board to ease
its monetary posture somewhat, which would lead to lower
interest rates. That would be supportive for gold." He said
investor confidence has been shaken by recent Saudi Arabian
gold sales, and noted that there have been rumors that the
Saudis will be paying for some major arms transactions fairly
soon, which could lead to additional sales of the metal.
Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank,
New York, said precious metals have been pulled in both
directions by weak oil prices (negative for gold) and a weak
dollar (positive for gold), which have "produced a
directionless market with disappointing volume." Mr. Mehta
said he thinks investors fear a credit crunch, and that "if
we got one, it would produce a weakened real-estate market
and a deflationary environment. That would certainly foster
lower prices for gold."
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Prices moved over a fairly broad range, but the
May-delivery contract finished down only 1.25 cents a pound,
at $1.1685, after being as high as $1.20 a pound. Mr. O'Neill
of Elders Futures said that even though strike-affected
Southern Peru Copper Corp. hasn't declared a force majeure,
it has in effect put one in place for April. A force majeure
is a condition that would permit a company to depart from the
strict terms of a contract -- in this case the delivery of
copper for April -- because of an event or effect that can't
be reasonably anticipated or controlled. The company's miners
and smelter workers in Peru have been on strike since March
12. According to news-service reports, the company has said
it has no intentions of declaring a force majeure and that
such talk is pure speculation. Mr. O'Neill says that unless
the strike is over soon, he believes it inevitable that a
force majeure will be declared. "The company is putting up a
good front. But it's clear that they are running low on
refined copper," he said. "It's just a question of time." Mr.
O'Neill noted that shipments of copper out of Zambia have
been picking up. The most recent cargo was for 13,400 tons,
up from 10,600 tons the previous week. Michael Frawley, a
metals trader at PaineWebber, New York, says he believes the
production problems in Peru are fully discounted in the
market. He added that he thinks the strike in Peru will end
soon and the market has taken this into account. He also
noted that the market has run into considerable price
resistance in the $1.20-a-pound area for the May contract,
and that physical demand for copper in April has been largely
satisfied. However, he adds, "If physical demand in May picks
up, it could provide renewed strength to the market."
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures fell
slightly amid reports that the harvest in Brazil is rapidly
approaching the halfway point. Prices were also depressed by
news that lawmakers in Brazil approved a sweeping
anti-inflation program. The program, if successful, would
take away the incentive for Brazilian farmers to hoard their
soybean harvest. Analysts are speculating that farmers will
begin to sell their crop, which would increase the supply of
Brazilian soybeans for export. Brazil is a major competitor
of the U.S. in the world soybean market. Prices of corn
futures fell slightly yesterday. Prices of soft red winter
wheat contracts settled mixed at the Chicago Board of Trade.
