   Yield isn't everything.
   That may sound like heresy to investors in money-market
mutual funds. Typically, they go for the highest yields.
   But the fact is that there are a lot of other things to
consider when choosing a money fund.
   Safety for one. Although nobody has ever suffered a loss
in a money fund, there have been a couple of close calls.
"The biggest issue is risk," says John Markese, director of
research for the American Association of Individual
Investors, a Chicago educational organization. "Most
questions (from investors) used to be about yield, now
they're about safety."
   Other things -- from the size of the fund, to its
geographic location, to the services it provides and the fees
it does or doesn't charge -- are also important for investors
pouring tens of billions of dollars a year into money funds.
   Here's a look at the key factors:
                                                                                                       

   SAFETY. Money funds are among the safest investments,
although they don't carry federal deposit insurance like bank
accounts. They are structured so that the value of an
investor's shares remains at $1 each, and only the yield
changes to reflect the return on the investments in fund
portfolios. Money funds are also highly liquid; in most cases
an investor can withdraw money simply by writing a check.
   For the most part, differences in safety are slight. The
Securities and Exchange Commission limits money funds'
investments to highly rated securities. But there are
gradations.
   Some funds limit themselves to the very highest ratings of
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Others accept the second-highest rating. Some funds invest
only in Treasury securities, or Treasury and
government-agency securities. Others are putting much of
their cash into commercial paper, which is unsecured
short-term corporate IOUs, and dollar-denominated
certificates of deposit sold overseas.
   About half the assets of taxable money funds are currently
invested in commercial paper. That's up from 44% at the start
of 1989 and 29% at the start of 1984. Thus the quality of
that commercial paper is a question for money-fund investors,
especially if the economy turns down.
   Just last month, when the commercial paper of Mortgage &amp;
Realty Trust was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, the parent
companies of several money funds bought Mortgage &amp; Realty
paper from their funds to protect them from possible losses.
Last year, when Integrated Resources Inc. defaulted on nearly
$1 billion of commercial paper, the parents of Value Line
Cash Fund and Liquid Green Trust absorbed the losses.
   "Look at a fund's standards for buying commercial paper,"
says Kurt Brouwer, an investment adviser with the San
Francisco firm Brouwer &amp; Janachowski. "You should be willing
to give up a quarter or a half point (of yield) to make sure
you're safeguarding" your investment.
   The safest funds usually are those that invest exclusively
in Treasury and government-agency securities, which are
backed by the U.S. government.
                                                                                                       

   YIELD. On average, money-fund yields are higher than those
on many comparable investments, such as bank money-market
accounts and short-term certificates of deposit. The latest
average seven-day compound yield is 7.99%. Compound yields
assume reinvestment of dividends.
   But yields on the more than 400 taxable funds vary widely.
Yields on individual funds range from 6.54% to 8.85%. The
difference is equal to $231 a year on a $10,000 investment.
   "You can earn one-third more by picking the right fund,"
says William E. Donoghue, publisher of IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter.
   Yields on funds that limit their investments to government
securities are usually slightly lower than on other funds.
According to Donoghue's, the average seven-day compound yield
of Treasury-only funds is currently 7.70%.
                                                                                                       

   AVERAGE MATURITY. Longer maturities enable a fund to
retain higher yields when interest rates are falling, just as
shorter maturities permit it to latch onto higher-yielding
securities sooner when rates are rising. The average for the
taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's currently is a fairly
long 45 days.
   Some financial advisers recommend choosing a fund that's
close to the average for all taxable funds. "I wouldn't want
a fund with a real long average maturity . . . beyond 50 or
60 days," says Mr. Donoghue of Money Fund Report.
   The problem with the longer maturities is that they make
it difficult for fund managers to take advantage of quick
increases in interest rates. As a result, yields can lag
those of funds with shorter average maturities when rates are
rising.
   In an extreme case, average maturity could also become a
safety issue. If shareholders decided to bail out, the
manager could be forced to dump securities at fire-sale
prices, thereby lowering the net asset value of the fund.
   Currently, one of the funds with the longest average
maturities is Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, at 83 days. Joseph
DiMartino, president of Dreyfus Corp. and manager of the
fund, says the long average maturity isn't a problem. There
are securities maturing every day that could be used to meet
redemptions, he says.
                                                                                                       

   FUND EXPENSES. These are the charges a fund deducts from
the return on its investments to meet various costs of
running the fund. What's left is the yield that's passed
along to investors.
   The current average is about 0.75% of assets, but some
funds, like Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, temporarily are waiving
fees. Others, like R. Meeder &amp; Associates Inc., which manages
Flex-Fund, waive a portion of the fees as a matter of policy
to keep the fund among the highest yielding.
   Dreyfus now says it will waive fees on Worldwide Dollar at
least until June 15, or when assets reach $7.5 billion.
Fidelity Spartan currently is charging investors just 0.10%
of assets and has guaranteed that the so-called expense ratio
won't top 0.45% at least until March 1991.
   "If it's not too inconvenient, you should take advantage
of" the fee waivers, says Sheldon Jacobs, editor of No-Load
Fund Investor, a newsletter based in Hastingson-Hudson, N.Y.
"It's like buying things on sale."
                                                                                                       

   SERVICES. Most funds offer free check writing, but
Fidelity Spartan, which is among the highest yielding,
charges $2 a check. Check minimums also differ. The minimum
is $1,000 at Fidelity Spartan and just $100 at Flex-Fund.
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Cash Management Account, the largest
money fund, doesn't charge a per-check fee but carries an
$80-a-year account fee.
   Active investors might want to choose a fund that's part
of a large family of funds that permits switching between
funds by telephone, so they can move their money around
easily.
                                                                                                       

   SIZE. Larger funds may have lower expense ratios, because
fixed costs are spread over a broader base, and may be better
able to absorb losses in case of a default.
   Some people even consider a fund's location in their
decision because they don't want their deposits spending time
in the U.S. mail instead of earning interest. Some funds
permit wire transfers from your bank.
   "Look at what you want from a money fund," advises Mr.
Donoghue. "If you want to use it as a checking account, look
for low check minimums and no check-writing fees. If you're
looking for a supersavings account, you want the highest
yield. For super-safety, take a government fund. A small
saver wants a low minimum deposit. You're buying this thing
for the services."
