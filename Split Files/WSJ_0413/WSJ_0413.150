   NEW YORK -- The dollar finished narrowly mixed in thin
trading, with dealers reluctant to take positions for fear of
having them jeopardized by unexpected news during the long
Easter weekend.
   The U.S. unit edged higher against the yen, the mark, the
Swiss franc and sterling, while it slipped against its
French, Italian and Canadian counterparts.

   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6724 marks, up from 1.6715 marks late Wednesday, and at
158.18 yen, up from 158 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6415, down from $1.6433 Wednesday.
   Early Friday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 158.30
yen, up from Thursday's close of 158 yen in Tokyo.
   The market remained cautious after last Saturday's meeting
of the Group of Seven industrial nations. Traders are still
struggling to grasp the probable results of the meeting,
speculating that heavy coordinated intervention to defend the
yen is yet to come, or that the Bank of Japan will raise
interest rates as early as this weekend. Another possibility
is that Japan has agreed to raise rates in exchange for
coordinated intervention by the other G-7 members, dealers
said.
   James Merrill, senior international economist at McCarthy,
Crisanti &amp; Maffei in New York, contended that the G-7 sent a
signal when it talked about a currency -- the yen -- other
than the dollar, and then said it wouldn't be helpful for the
Japanese unit to weaken. "The market was maybe left in doubt
about what would be done, by whom, and when," he said.
   Because of the recent G-7 meeting, a quick increase in the
Japanese discount rate can't be ruled out, according to Chris
Manno, chief dealer at Midland Bank PLC in New York. The
other G-7 members may have forced Japan to take that step, he
said.
   The discount rate is the Japanese central bank's base rate
on loans to commercial banks.
   Mr. Manno said dealers are consolidating after the U.S.
unit's recent gains in preparation for another sharp climb by
the dollar against the Japanese currency. He said the dollar
could reach 165 yen by early summer, a level that some
traders had expected this week in the absence of G-7 action
to stop its rise.
   But Robert White, vice president and manager of corporate
trading at First Interstate of California in Los Angeles,
said the absence of G-7 intervention was reflected in the
yen's slide against the West German currency. "You could make
a point that there are problems in Japan and there are
problems here {in the U.S.} and the mark is benefiting," he
said.
   The mark crept to 94.58 yen in late New York trading from
94.47 yen late Wednesday in New York.
   The Commerce Department said that the nation's retail
sales for March fell 0.6%, contrasted with a consensus
estimate for a gain of 0.2%. The revision for February showed
a decline of 0.3%.
   Most of the recent U.S. economic numbers have been worse
than expected, said Mr. White. Although he doesn't expect the
Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy immediately, Mr.
White said the market is switching its perception more and
more to the possibility that the next Fed move could be in
favor of lowering rates.
   Noting, too, the pressure of the Treasury and the White
House on the Fed to lower rates, Mr. White said a drop in
commodity prices could allay the inflationary fears of the
Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee.
   European dealers said the market is growing anxious over
the dollar's range trading in recent weeks. And while the
dollar has been locked in a range to a degree because of
skittishness over potential G-7 action to prop up the yen,
some dealers said that there are signs of growing
disenchantment over the dollar's chances for making
significant gains against the yen and other currencies.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $375.90, up $1.60, on light volume of an
estimated two million ounces.
