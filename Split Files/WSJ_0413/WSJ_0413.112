   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
formally established a service that enables airline
passengers to make phone calls during flights.
   The action, on a 4-1 vote, lets Airfone Inc., a unit of
GTE Corp., continue operations, but also opens up the
four-megahertz spectrum to competitors, including a new
service, In-Flight Phone, owned by Jack Goeken, Airfone's
founder.

   Airfone has been operating under an experimental license
since 1984 and has installed air-to-ground phones in about
1,260 aircraft, or about a third of the U.S. airlines'
domestic fleet.
   In recent months, Airfone has begun installing phones in
each row of seats, a move that has led to a fourfold increase
in calling. So far, Airfone has installed the additional
phones on 93 aircraft, and has signed contracts with several
carriers, including United Airlines, to equip their fleets, a
spokesman said.
   The commission said it adopted an "open entry" plan
because the panel believes the service would develop faster
and be more innovative. The agency envisions that individual
carriers will contract with phone-service providers.
   A GTE spokesman said the company was pleased with the
outcome of the lengthy FCC proceeding. In recent weeks, other
companies had proposed alternative uses for the spectrum,
including using it for cellular-phone service.
   Sandra Goeken, a vice president with her father's company,
said the Goeken Group is "delighted." The FCC's action clears
the way for competitors to apply for licenses to operate
phone systems, and the In-Flight Phone service could be ready
by the fall, she said.
   The new Goeken service is digital, compared with the older
analog technology used by Airfone, and Ms. Goeken said she
expects to provide airline passengers with a wide range of
information services, facsimile service and computer links.
"As an airline passenger, you could have access to everything
you have at your desk," she said.
   To discourage speculative applications, the FCC requires
applicants to have a service agreement with at least one
airline and insists that construction of the systems are
completed within five years, with a minimum of 25 base
stations before service can begin. In addition, licenses
can't be transferred until a year after construction is
completed.
   Separately, the commission approved plans by the regional
Bell telephone companies for breaking out the basic services
in their network so that all information-service providers
can obtain individual services on an equal footing with the
Bell companies themselves.
   The move was a step forward in the fight to open up the
networks so that business and residential telephone users can
have more choices of special services.
   The commission required seven Bell companies to file minor
changes by July and update their plans by April 15, 1991.
   The Bell companies were generally pleased with the
commission action, but expressed concerns about the changes
the commission may require. Geni Porti, a specialist in the
field at Nynex Corp., called the commission's action "a
significant step forward in the whole process."
   On another telephone matter, the commission voted
unanimously to make all credit card phones and phones in
workplaces, hotels, motels, hospitals and other public
facilities compatible for persons with hearing aids.
   The commission decided that credit card phones must be
accessible to the hearing-impaired by May 1, 1991, and those
in workplaces and other facilities by May 1, 1992. Under law,
phones made for use in the U.S. after August 1989 must be
compatible with hearing aids.
