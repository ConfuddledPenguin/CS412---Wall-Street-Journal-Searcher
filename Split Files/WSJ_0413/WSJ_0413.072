   The revolving door to the chief executive's office at
Winnebago Industries Inc. took another spin as the motor home
maker fired Richard D. Conner four months after naming him to
the post.
   As it has done in the past, the board named John K.
Hanson, the 76-year-old chairman and founder, to run the
Forest City, Iowa, company -- at least on an interim basis.
Mr. Hanson, who with his wife controls about 46% of the
company's stock, becomes "acting chief executive."

   The latest management shuffle comes amid signs of growing
problems at Winnebago, including a slump in its basic
business of making motor homes, and continued losses at
Cycle-Sat, a pet project of Mr. Hanson that transmits
commercials to television stations via satellite.
   Winnebago wouldn't go beyond a brief statement that it
"terminated the employment" of Mr. Conner. But the action
heightens concern among analysts and a growing legion of
former executives over the apparent inability of Mr. Hanson
to get along with his top executives.
   Among the seven executives Mr. Hanson has ousted from the
top spot over the past 15 years is his son, John V. Hanson.
The son eventually rejoined the company and became deputy
chairman before leaving again last year.
   "The theme that emerges is whoever runs that place has to
run it to the complete approval of John K., and if not, he
sees fit to find someone he likes," said Frank Rolfes, an
analyst who follows Winnebago for Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Minneapolis.
   Mr. Conner was named chief executive officer and president
in December after a stint heading the company's Cycle-Sat
unit. For 14 months before that, Winnebago had no chief
executive -- a management committee that included as many as
10 people ran Winnebago. The appointment of the committee
followed the ouster of Gerald W. Gilbert, who was fired in
1988 after his moves to reform the manufacturing process
angered production workers and Mr. Hanson.
   In the six months ended Feb. 24, Winnebago had a loss of
nearly $10 million, or 40 cents a share. Declining demand for
motor homes sent revenue plummeting 32% from a year earlier,
to $159.6 million. Also hurting results were continued losses
at Cycle-Sat and start-up costs for a new division that makes
commercial vehicles.
   Despite Mr. Hanson's penchant for dabbling in the stock
market, one of Mr. Conner's early goals was to turn the
company's $20 million portfolio into instruments with "very
low risk." But he apparently failed to do that quickly, as
the company had a loss of $1 million before taxes on its
financial investments in its latest quarter.
   Winnebago recently liquidated its marketable securities
and sold dealer receivables to help pay off short-term debt.
The action came after negotiations with financial
institutions failed to achieve what the company called
"acceptable credit terms."
   When appointed in December, Mr. Conner sounded optimistic
about his ability to get along with the founder, despite the
troubles of others before him. Referring to Mr. Hanson as
Winnebago's "coach," Mr. Conner said he planned to talk
frequently by telephone to Mr. Hanson at the chairman's home
in Florida.
   "I don't believe we've ever had a cross word," Mr. Conner
said at the time.
   Neither he nor Mr. Hanson returned phone calls.
