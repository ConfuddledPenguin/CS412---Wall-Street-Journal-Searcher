   Costain Group PLC, a British construction, civil
engineering and mining concern, reported a 38% drop in pretax
profit for 1989, reflecting a depressed housing market.
   Costain reported pretax profit for the year of #55.1
million ($90.7 million), down from #89.2 million the year
before. The market had expected the company to post pretax
profit of between #70 million and #75 million.

   Sales rose 22% to #1.4 billion from #1.15 billion.
   Costain said it decided to write down the value of its
housing land in the United Kingdom by #20 million to "reflect
the current very depressed conditions in this sector of our
business."
   Profit after tax and minority interests but before
extraordinary items declined 31% to #40.4 million from #58.9
million.
   The company said its engineering and construction units
posted 50% increases in operating profit. In addition,
Costain's mining and commercial property businesses reported
record profit. But these gains were "offset by very poor
results from U.K. housing," the company said.
