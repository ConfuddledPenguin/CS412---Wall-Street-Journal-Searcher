   WASHINGTON -- This month, the Bell companies moved one
step closer to the day when customers will just punch a
button to summon up a movie, a billing record or a plumber
available at midnight on New Year's Eve.
   The green light came from a federal appeals court here,
which reversed a lower court's extension of the ban on Bell
ownership of electronic directory services, sports scores,
stock quotes and other information that might one day be
transmitted over telephone networks.

   The appeals court told the lower court to rethink the
decision using a more lenient legal standard.
   The regional Bells' shares initially jumped more than $1
on the news, as Wall Street contemplated the potential of the
giant, unfettered Bells thundering into the information
services market. After all, the Bell regional phone companies
have spent six years fighting in the courts and in Congress
to end the restrictions on information services,
manufacturing and long-distance service that were imposed
under the consent decree breaking up the Bell System.
   But now reality is setting in, and many analysts are
concluding that the Bells' payoff from the electronic
information age isn't just around the corner.
   The Bells "could become reasonably powerful in electronic
yellow pages," says Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. But
it will take a while. And he believes the lower court, in
unleashing the Bells, will probably take pains to "ensure
that the Bells have absolutely no advantage over independent
data providers."
   Bell companies' stocks have been buoyed of late by the
strong promise of their cellular mobile-telephone businesses,
as well as by regulatory breaks and cost-cutting. Their
stocks generally trade at multiples of earnings that match or
exceed the overall stock market.
   Ameritech and U S West both trade at 13 times the past
year's per-share earnings. BellSouth, Pacific Telesis and
Southwestern Bell have multiples of 15 to 16; Bell Atlantic,
17, and Nynex 20 (last year's Nynex profit included heavy
one-time charges.)
   Most residential telephone customers don't currently own
computer terminals to call up fancy information services.
Punching buttons on a phone keypad isn't the easiest way to
extract certain types of data. And it's unclear exactly what
the Bells might try to sell that isn't already available,
sometimes for free.
   To be sure, all seven will benefit once they can offer
electronic yellow pages. Some Bells are trying to position
themselves better than their siblings to bolt when the
judiciary or Congress opens the gate.
   "Bell Atlantic has been very aggressive on the class
services side (Caller I.D., Call Forwarding, Call Trace and
the like), and BellSouth has a lot of advanced technology in
its network, so it's more leading-edge," says Jack B. Grubman
of Paine Webber.
   "Some have shown a proclivity to be more venturesome,"
says Greg Sawers at Sanford Bernstein. He rates BellSouth and
Southwestern Bell the most aggressive, although Southwestern
recently ended its yearlong videotex "gateway" tests in
Houston. (Through a gateway, customers with computer
terminals can reach a wide range of information providers.) U
S West, which is providing low-cost computer terminals with
its gateway in Omaha, could be in a relatively good position,
too.
   On the other hand, Mr. Sawers notes, Ameritech didn't even
attempt to test a videotex gateway, and Pacific Telesis,
scanning the ruins of other electronic publishing ventures,
canceled a gateway test just before its scheduled debut.
   One part of the appeals court ruling hobbled the Bells by
upholding a ban on their entry into long distance. So the
Bells won't be the ones pocketing the long-distance revenue
when faraway customers dial up a central computer brimming
with costly-to-gather information.
   "The real benefit of owning a data base and providing it
to customers is to centralize," says Robert Morris III,
telecommunications analyst for Goldman Sachs. "Take the
example of California. Pacific Telesis would have to contract
with, say MCI Communications to carry calls between San
Francisco and L.A."
   For years, the Bells have complained that phone companies
in other countries such as France have been able to provide
information services to their customers. The Bells contend
that because of their ban, the U.S. is slipping into a
second-rate telecommunications power.
   What the Bell companies eventually want is clearance from
Congress to enter the cable television gold mine -- and
permission to own at least a portion of the programming.
Revenue from video entertainment, they say, will allow them
to build a state-of-the-art fiber-optic network.
   If the French Minitel system is indeed the model the Bells
claim it is, information services could be a mixed blessing.
"Minitel was a nice windfall for French businesses because it
made it easier to reach customers," says Mr. Morris of
Goldman Sachs. "The phone company gave away all these
terminals, and the public is paying for them through higher
rates. But one of the main things the general public uses
Minitel for is pornography."
