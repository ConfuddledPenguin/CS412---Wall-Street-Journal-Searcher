shortened session.

observance of Good Friday.

   In trading yesterday, bond dealers said activity briefly
perked up and prices rose following the morning release of
the March retail sales report by the Department of Commerce.
Retail sales fell 0.6% in March, a bigger decline than some
analysts had expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones
Capital Markets Report, for example, had forecast a 0.2%
decline.
   The larger decline was interpreted by investors as a sign
that consumer spending might be dwindling, which in turn
could lead to slower economic growth. The data are considered
bullish for bonds because slower growth could reduce
inflationary pressures.
   However, some economists said investors may be reaching
too far by basing investment decisions on movements in the
retail sales statistics, which can gyrate wildly from month
to month.
   "I really think the market is searching for some news to
move on," said Ken Ackbarali, senior economist and vice
president at First Interstate Bancorp. "Sometimes it invents
its own interpretations of very small changes in the
numbers," he said.
   Later in the day, bond prices fell as dealers and large
institutional investors began selling bonds to square
positions ahead of the long weekend and the release of the
March producer price index.
   By the end of the day, investors were focusing on today's
producer price index report, considered the most important
economic indicator to be released this week.
   Producer prices, a measure of inflation on the wholesale
level, are estimated to have advanced 0.1% in March and 0.3%
excluding the volatile energy and food components of the
index, according to the average estimate of 16 economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
   In February, the index was unchanged, after rising 1.8% in
January. Excluding food and energy prices, February's index
gained 0.4%, following January's 0.1% rise.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Citicorp expects to sell $250 million of securities backed
by credit-card loans to retail investors later this month
through an underwriting group headed by Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   The issue, the third retail offering by Citicorp, is due
to have a five-year average life and will be available in a
minimum denomination of $1,000.
   The planned sale by Citicorp, the largest issuer in the
three-year-old credit-card securities market, is part of
Citicorp's strategy to broaden the investor base for the
securities. So far, the bulk of the $11 billion of Citicorp
credit-card securities has been sold to large institutional
investors and other banks.
   Some money managers don't think credit-card securities are
right for individuals.
   For one thing, the transactions are structured in such a
way that many small investors don't fully understand what
they are getting. Also, credit-card securities targeted to
retail investors have lower yields than those targeted to
institutions because of higher distribution costs. Sales
commissions are much higher on retail issues than on
institutional issues.
   Citicorp's retail offering in November was priced at 1/2
percentage point above comparable Treasury securities, while
its institutional offerings were priced at 9/10 of a
percentage point above Treasurys.
   Still, Citicorp hasn't had much trouble selling the
securities to the little guy. The banking concern made a $500
million sale to retail investors in April 1989, which was the
first credit-card offering targeted to retail investors, and
$325 million of securities was sold to retail investors in
November. Citicorp has made nearly $4 billion of credit-card
securities offerings to institutional investors this year.
   The planned retail offering is expected to get a triple-A
rating.
   Meanwhile, mortgage securities ended mixed in light
trading. Government National Mortgage Association 9%
securities for April delivery were quoted at 95 30/32,
unchanged, to yield 9.72% to a 12-year average life
assumption. Ginnie Mae 10% securities were at 100 5/8, down
1/32.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices ended moderately lower in light trading
activity. The benchmark 30-year bond ended nearly 1/4 point
lower, a loss of about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue ended at 98 29/32 to yield 8.59%, compared
with 99 4/32 to yield 8.57% on Wednesday. The latest 10-year
bonds ended at 99 to yield 8.63%, compared with 99 5/32 to
yield 8.61%.
   Short-term rates ended little changed. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 7.76% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8%, while the discount rate on
six-month Treasury bills rose slightly to 7.78% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8.19%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. gave back some of their
recent gains to close lower on light profit-taking.
   RJR's 13.71% pay-in-kind convertible debentures due in
2009 fell 1/2 point to 80 3/4 in thin trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The other widely held RJR issue, the 13.71% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures maturing in 2007 was 5/8 point lower
at 67 7/8.
   The bonds advanced as much as 4 3/4 points Wednesday on
rumors that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. was buying back the
pay-in-kind bonds, which pay interest in the form of
additional bonds rather than cash. Officials at the companies
declined to comment.
   In other activity, high-yield bonds of Ames Department
Stores Inc. were bid for "flat," or without accrued interest.
When bonds trade "flat," it means that bondholders don't
expect the company to make future interest payments.
   Ames junk bonds plunged nine points Tuesday on news about
the company's financial woes. Since then, the retailer's 13%
senior subordinated reset notes due in 1999 have dropped an
additional 10 points to a bid price of 27.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded issues finished unchanged.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds ended weaker as the monthly
measures of inflation and labor costs were higher than
expected.
   Britain's retail price index rose 1% in March from
February and 8.1% on the year, with the year-on-year pace of
inflation reaching its highest level since July 1989.
Officials attributed the gains primarily to increases in
mortgage rates, which are predominantly adjustable in the
United Kingdom and to higher food prices.
   The labor report showed, among other things, that average
earnings increased at an annual rate of 9 1/2% in February,
up from 9 1/4% in January.
   Among benchmarks, the 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 1/2
point to 97 3/8 to yield 12.11%. But trading was muted by
absences ahead of the four-day Easter holiday weekend.
   In Japan, government bonds ended stronger on a large buy
order in the futures market just before the Tokyo Stock
Exchange closed.
   Dealers said in the last half hour of trading, a buy order
of 200 billion yen ($1.26 billion) came into the futures
market.
   "I think this was the second-largest buy order ever, and
I've been here for four years," said a dealer at a
foreign-based securities firm. "After the order came into the
market, futures prices climbed by 20 ticks."
   The buyer may have bought futures because it needed bonds
to deliver into options, said one dealer at a U.S.-based
bank. Today is the change of settlement date for options. He
also said the buyer may have simply been covering short
positions.
   In a short sale, dealers sell borrowed securites and later
seek to make a profit by buying the securities back at a
lower price.
   Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond rose 0.16 point
to 86.39 to yield 7.275%.
   West German bonds ended slightly weaker in very quiet
trading.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempts were flat to up 1/8 point in quiet trading.
   In competitive dealings, a Prudential-Bache Capital
Funding group won a $53 million issue of Milwaukee County
general obligation corporate purpose bonds.
   This week, $910 million in new debt was priced.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 1/8 point at 97 1/2
bid to yield 7.40%.
