   HOUSTON -- Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air
Corp., said its March traffic declined 3.8% to 3.3 billion
revenue passenger miles from 3.43 billion miles a year
earlier.
   A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one
mile. The carrier's March load factor, or the percentage of
available seats occupied, decreased to 61.1% from 63.1%
because the year-earlier month included Easter travel results
that will occur in April this year.

   For the first three months of this year, Continental's
traffic rose less than 1% to 9.07 billion revenue passenger
miles from 9.03 billion miles a year earlier. The load factor
increased to 59.5% from 57.6%.
