   PERTH -- Australian financier Kerry Packer withdrew a
hostile takeover bid for Bond Media Ltd., a national
television station operator that is part of Alan Bond's
beleaguered corporate empire.
   Mr. Packer sold the network to Bond in 1987 for around 1
billion Australian dollars (US$766 million). He still is owed
A$200 million from that transaction. When it looked as if the
cash-strapped Bond group couldn't repay the debt, Mr. Packer
began a takeover bid for Bond Media that valued the company
at just A$53 million.

   Mr. Packer announced in December that he would offer one
share in a new company, Television Corp. of Australia, for
every 10 Bond Media shares. It valued Bond Media at 10 cents
a share -- the stock currently is trading at about 13 cents a
share -- and attracted few acceptances.
   An underwriting agreement arranged by Packer for the bid
expires Sunday. Packer started wind-up, or liquidation
proceedings, on April 6 in the Western Australia state
Supreme Court against Bond Media. The action will be heard
May 2, with an application from Bond Media to have the
petition dismissed.
   Bond Media, meanwhile, is trying to arrange a capital
injection from foreign television companies to reduce debt,
and wants to restructure its finances.
   Separately, Bond Corp. International Ltd., a Hong Kong
unit of Mr. Bond's corporate group, said it concluded the
sale of its interest in Compania de Telefonos de Chile S.A.
for US$388.5 million.
   The company announced in February a preliminary agreement
to sell its 53% stake in Chile's national telephone company
to T.I. Telefonica Internacional de Espana S.A. of Spain.
   Bond Corp. is selling assets to reduce its total debt of
almost A$7 billion.
