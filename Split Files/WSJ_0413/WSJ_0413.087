   BOSTON -- A federal court declined to prohibit coverage of
the Boston Marathon by television stations that don't have a
contract with the race's organizer, in a ruling that may make
some existing sports-broadcast rights arrangements
unenforceable.
   The ruling effectively invalidates a contract between the
Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race, and
WBZTV, the local National Broadcasting Co. affiliate, for
"exclusive" live broadcast rights to the marathon, scheduled
to be run Monday.

   After other local stations indicated their intention to
broadcast live despite the contract, WBZ sought an injunction
against the other stations, saying their transmissions would
violate the athletic association's property and trademark
rights. In his ruling yesterday, U.S. District Court Judge
David S. Nelson denied the injunction.
   In his ruling, Judge Nelson said the BAA had "no property
right in the unfolding news event of the Boston Marathon as
it occurs on public streets."
   The ruling was issued despite an affidavit from ABC
Sports, a division of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., that argued
that without exclusive rights arrangements, television
coverage of many sporting events that take place on public
property wouldn't be viable. In its affidavit, ABC listed 40
public events covered by exclusive rights arrangements,
including many Olympic events, the New York City and Los
Angeles marathons, Grand Prix auto racing and bicycle races
including the Tour de France.
   The ruling "may well have an adverse impact" on other
contracts, said James Spence, president of Sports Television
International Inc., a New York firm that markets sporting
events. "If you eliminate exclusivity, you undermine the
financial support that accrues the event, and that's
unfortunate," Mr. Spence added.
   The case produced some odd bedfellows. Although Capital
Cities/ABC supported the WBZ-Boston Marathon contract, the
local ABC affiliate in Boston, WCVB, was a direct beneficiary
of the judge's ruling.
   Despite the ruling, final coverage details of the marathon
remained murky. WBZ, the NBC affiliate, and the BAA
immediately appealed, asking for a dispatched ruling before
the race. Meanwhile, the BAA said it will continue to
withhold press credentials for the finish-line area from WCVB
and other television stations. NBC is a unit of General
Electric Co.
   The ruling also produced the possibility that mobile
camera trucks from various stations will show up to cover the
event, complicating safety and security arrangements. In the
past, TV stations have pooled access to feeds from trucks at
various race points.
   Also unclear was the status of the supposedly exclusive
rights sold by the BAA to Sports Channel for live national
coverage of the event.
   Local television stations, including WBZ, WCVB and CBS
Inc. affiliate WHDH, have given extensive live coverage to
the marathon in the past. The race, which occurs on a state
holiday in Massachusetts and attracts thousands of public
spectators along the 26-mile route, has been a big revenue
producer in the past for broadcasters.
