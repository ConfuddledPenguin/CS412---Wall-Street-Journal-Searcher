   McDonald's Corp., blistered by a newspaper advertisement
contending it is contributing to the "poisoning of America,"
warned several of the nation's largest newspapers against
printing the ad again.
   "The advertisement is recklessly and maliciously
calculated to inflict the greatest possible injury on
McDonald's," a letter to publishers said, claiming the ad had
numerous factual errors. "Any further publication of the
advertisement without (corrections) . . . would have to be
considered malicious," the restaurant chain said.

   Headlined "The Poisoning of America] Part III," the
full-page ad appeared last week in this newspaper as well as
the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today and about
a dozen other papers around the country. The ads were paid
for by an Omaha, Neb., businessman, Phil Sokolof, a crusader
against cholesterol who blames a heart attack some 23 years
ago on poor diet. In the ad, Mr. Sokolof was identified as
the president of the National Heart Savers Association.
   Mr. Sokolof's ad singled out McDonald's, asserting that
"your hamburgers have too much fat]" Adjacent to a drawing of
a Big Mac hamburger and McDonald's french fries was copy
saying those two items together contain 25 grams of saturated
fat. The ad also said "many fast-food chains" cook their
fries in "heart healthy oils" while McDonald's uses beef
tallow -- all contentions that the McDonald's letter
disputes.
   The letter was written by Joseph A. Califano Jr., a
prominent Washington attorney who represents the Oak Brook,
Ill., fast-food chain on nutrition and other food matters.
The former secretary of Health, Education and Welfare is now
with the law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp;
Wood.
   A McDonald's spokesman said the letter, with its implicit
threat of legal action, "reflects how strongly we feel about
correcting the misinformation in the ad." He said he knew of
no newspaper that contacted McDonald's prior to publication
to check out the advertisement's veracity. "We're asked to
demonstrate the facts behind ads we run in newspapers and on
television," he said.
   Bernard T. Flanagan, vice president of marketing for The
Wall Street Journal, said the newspaper's advertising
department had "looked at the ad very carefully and decided
it was all right to run." Asked whether the paper would
publish it again, Mr. Flanagan said "we would have to take a
look again and see if any of our standards were broken."
   A New York Times spokeswoman said, "We had no reason to
suspect the facts in this ad, so it's unlikely they were
checked." She added that "we neither agree nor disagree with
the ad. We don't think it was irresponsible to run the ad and
we have a long-standing tradition of running opinion
advertising which allows an advertiser a forum for expression
of its position." She characterized the letter, written to
Publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, as private correspondence,
but said he intends to reply to Mr. Califano.
   A USA Today spokeswoman said the Gannett newspaper's
lawyers were reviewing the Califano letter.
   Mr. Sokolof said the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Sun-Times,
the Boston Globe, New York Daily News and the Houston
Chronicle, refused to run his ad. He wouldn't comment
yesterday on whether he intended to republish it but said he
had been overwhelmed by the "positive response" it received.
"But some people have said, `Hey, I like McDonald's. Go
whistle,' or worse than that," he said.
   Mr. Sokolof, 67 years old, said he had been in contact
with McDonald's as well as several other major fast-food
chains in recent days but wouldn't elaborate. Asked whether
McDonald's had threatened legal action against him, Mr.
Sokolof said there had been no such conversation.
