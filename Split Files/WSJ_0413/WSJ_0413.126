   NEW YORK -- Stock prices rallied as market investors found
reasons to be less pessimistic about the first-quarter
earnings reports starting to flood the market.
   Upward revisions of some first-quarter earnings estimates
for International Business Machines spurred the gains,
traders said, while Chemical Banking moved higher as its
results for the quarter proved better than expected.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.07 to 2751.80
--  only its second close above 2750 in the past three
months. The first came March 19, when the 30-stock average
reached its recent high of 2755.63.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
climbed 2.42 to 344.34, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index went up 1.23 to 188.80, and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index added 2.41 to 320.73. Advancing issues topped decliners
on the Big Board by 908 to 573.
   Prices steadily advanced through midday, when they peaked
as trading began to slacken in advance of the observance of
Good Friday. U.S. stock exchanges will be closed today for
the religious holiday.
   Despite the slowdown, brisk activity in a handful of
issues resulted in the busiest Big Board session of the
holiday-shortened week. Volume totaled 142,470,000 shares on
the Big Board, compared with 141,080,000 Wednesday.
   For the week, the industrial average recorded a gain of
34.68 points, or 1.3%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow equity index
also rose 1.3%, while the New York Stock Exchange Composite
gained 1.1%.
   Several Wall Street analysts have forecast that
first-quarter earnings overall could show double-digit
percentage declines from the level of a year earlier, and
stock prices have stayed within narrow trading ranges since
mid-March as investors awaited the earnings reports.
   "People are kind of steeled for a really tough
first-quarter round of earnings," said Eric T. Miller, chief
investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   As a result, Mr. Miller said, any positive earnings
surprises are likely to have a more broadly based impact on
the market than negative ones. "For the short term, the path
of least resistance is up," he said.
   But Jack Baker, head of capital commitments at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, said the market isn't likely to break out of
its trading-range pattern immediately. The industrial average
has remained within a range of about 60 points since hitting
the March 19 high.
   The latest advance is "just another run-up to the top end
of the trading range, and I don't see any reason to get
overly excited about it," Mr. Baker said. "I don't see the
urgency that (suggests) institutions are going to rush in
here on Monday."
   IBM gained 3/4 to 107 1/8 and traded as high as 108 during
the session. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein and Smith
Barney, Harris Upham both raised estimates of the company's
first-quarter earnings by 10 cents a share to $1.70, citing
indications that demand for IBM products may have been
stronger than they had anticipated. Bernstein also raised its
1990 estimate by 10 cents a share to $10.60.
   Chemical rallied 1 1/8 to 24 1/2 on Big Board composite
volume of 1.3 million shares after issuing its first-quarter
earnings data. Net income went up 28.7% from the year-ago
level, partly because of a gain in the latest period from the
sale of its stake in Florida National Banks of Florida.
   Bank of New York, which reported a 1.2% increase in
first-quarter net, dropped 3/8 to 31 3/8. Analysts had
generally anticipated a sharper rise. Other regional banks to
report first-quarter results included Barnett Banks, which
gained 1/4 to 30, and First Wachovia, which added 1 1/4 to 39
3/4.
   Ames Department Stores, the Big Board's most active issue
by a wide margin, tumbled 5/8 to 1 7/8 as more than 7.3
million shares changed hands. Some manufacturers have stopped
shipping goods to the discount department-store operator as a
result of its financial problems, and the delays could worsen
its difficulties, The Wall Street Journal reported.
   TJX, which holds a major stake in Ames, went down 1 to 13
1/2 as 2.1 million shares were traded. Activity was also
brisk in Public Service of Colorado, which rose 3/8 to 21 3/8
as trades designed to capture the stock's dividend pushed
volume to 5.2 million shares, and Federal National Mortgage
Association, which added 1 3/4 to 36 3/4 on 2.2 million
shares in the wake of a better-than-expected earnings report
Wednesday.
   Carter Hawley Hale skidded 1/2 to 7 after reporting that
its sales were down 1.9% in March from a year earlier, but
several other retailing issues rallied. K mart, whose March
sales were up 8.6%, climbed 1 to 35 1/4; J.C. Penney added
1/2 to 68 3/4; Dayton Hudson rose 1 1/4 to 70 3/4; Wal-Mart
Stores advanced 1 3/8 to 51 3/8, and Dillard Department
Stores gained 2 1/4 to 75 7/8.
   Oil stocks rebounded from their sell-off Wednesday as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed it is
considering an urgent meeting and other options to stop the
current decline in world oil prices. Mobil rose 1/2 to 60
1/8, Chevron added 7/8 to 66 3/4, Texaco gained 1 to 58 3/8,
Amoco tacked on 1 1/4 to 51 3/4, and Phillips Petroleum went
up 3/8 to 25 3/4.
   Glaxo Holdings added 1 to 27 1/8 after a presentation in
London by a Canadian company, Biochem, which is developing an
anti-AIDS drug. Glaxo holds U.S. distribution rights for the
drug and is funding Biochem's research.
   Marion Merrell Dow gained 3/4 to 25 3/8. Dow Chemical,
which acquired about 67% of the company's common stock
through the merger of its drug operations with Marion
Laboratories last year, said it plans to purchase an
additional four million shares -- a stake of about 1.5%.
   Mylan Laboratories fell 1 1/4 to 22 after Salomon Brothers
lowered its investment rating on the stock and its earnings
estimate for the fiscal year ending next March. Analyst
Robert Uhl told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report he
based the changes on a cutback in his 1990 sales forecast for
Eldepryl, a treatment for Parkinson's disease that Mylan and
Bolar Pharmaceutical produce in a joint venture. Bolar lost
1/4 to 8 7/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.
   Norton rose 1 1/8 to 77 1/8 on 1.5 million shares amid
speculation that the company could be forced to deal with its
hostile suitor, BTR PLC of Britain, or attempt to find
another bidder. A federal judge on Wednesday ordered Norton
to hold its annual meeting April 26 as scheduled; the
company, which is appealing the decision, has already
conceded that it was unlikely to prevail in its proxy fight
with BTR if the meeting isn't delayed.
   Control Data gained 1 1/8 to 21 1/8. The company is
expected to report its first-quarter results later this
month, and analysts said they expected the figures to show
that it returned to profitability after posting a loss of
$16.11 a share last year.
   RMI Titanium finished at 12 5/8 on its first day of
trading, up 1/8 from the price at which Quantum Chemical's
entire 50% stake in the company was sold in an initial
offering of 7.5 million shares. Quantum, which gained 1/4 to
23 1/2, said it expects to report a gain of about $15 million
on the sale.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index gained 0.34
to 357.88, cutting its loss for the week to 0.9%. Volume
totaled 12,560,000 shares compared with 13,520,000 Wednesday.
