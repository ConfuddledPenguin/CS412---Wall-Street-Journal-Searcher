   AKRON, Ohio -- B.F. Goodrich Co. reported a 69% drop in
first-quarter net income, mainly because of weak prices for
polyvinyl chloride, a plastic that is the company's most
important product. Nonetheless, the profit was somewhat
higher than analysts had expected.
   The plastics, specialty chemicals and aerospace concern
earned $16.2 million, or 56 cents a share, down from a
first-quarter record of $53 million, or $2.02 a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 first-quarter profit includes $2 million
from discontinued operations.

   Sales fell 4.2% to $589.8 million from $615.9 million.
   Operating profit from polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, and
related materials dropped 85% to $10.1 million from $68.1
million, on a 22% decline in sales to $272.1 million. Prices
for PVC fell sharply in the 1989 second half and remained
weak until the end of the 1990 first quarter. Meanwhile, the
price of propane, an important feedstock or raw material,
soared following the extremely cold weather in December.
   Operating profit from specialty chemicals rose 33%,
Goodrich said. Aerospace reported a 57% rise in operating
profit, but more than two-thirds of this increase resulted
from reversal of a previously established reserve, following
Goodrich's victory in a patent infringement suit brought by a
competitor.
   Analysts expect a sharp improvement by Goodrich in
subsequent quarters because of rising demand and higher
prices for PVC. Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. said that for 1990, he expects Goodrich to earn $3.75 a
share, which would be a decline from 1989 net of $172.4
million, or $6.48 a share. But last year's results reflected
a first-half boom in PVC, and 1989 profit was partly shielded
from taxes by investment tax-credit carryforwards, which were
exhausted by year end.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Goodrich shares closed at $42.375, up 12.5 cents.
