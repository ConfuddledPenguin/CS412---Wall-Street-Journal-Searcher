   ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. posted a
net loss of $8.9 million, or 48 cents a share, for its fourth
quarter, ended Jan. 29, after taking a $14.5 million charge
for the planned sale or franchising of its fast-food
restaurants in Arizona.
   In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Karcher had net income
$4.2 million, or 23 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter
rose 6% to $118 million from $111.3 million.

   The company said it is considering disposing or
franchising some or all of its 40 Arizona restaurants, which
have had losses of about $5 million a year. "It has become
apparent that the Arizona market does not make economic sense
for corporate operations," said Donald F. Karcher, president
and chief operating officer. "The future investment required
would have been prohibitive in view of the expected return."
Karcher and its licensees and franchisees operate 553
restaurants in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Japan.
   In addition to the one-time charge, results for the latest
fiscal year were hurt by generally weak conditions in the
restaurant industry, including heavy discounting and use of
coupons, plus inflation of food prices, Mr. Karcher said.
   For the year, net income fell 73% to $5.6 million, or 30
cents a share, from $20.8 million, or 97 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $511.3 million from $445.9
million. Prior-year per-share figures were adjusted to
reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid last July.
