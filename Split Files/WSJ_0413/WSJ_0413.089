   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said it extended for a second
week the shutdown of its Tempo and Topaz car-assembly plant

   The Oakville, Ontario, production facility, which was
closed this week because of slow sales, is now scheduled to
reopen April 23. About 2,200 hourly employees are affected by
the temporary closing.
