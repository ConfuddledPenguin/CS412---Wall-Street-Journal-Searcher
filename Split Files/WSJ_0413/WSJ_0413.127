   Analysts expect Peugeot S.A., France's sole private-sector
auto maker, to announce next week that its 1989 group profit
climbed by roughly 13% to about 10 billion francs (about
$1.78 billion) despite a debilitating strike last September
and October that shaved about three billion francs from group
revenue.
   Group profit totaled 8.85 billion francs in 1988. Peugeot
announced last February that 1989 group revenue rose 11% to
152.96 billion francs from 138.45 billion francs in 1988.

   Most Peugeot-watchers are bullish about the auto group's
performance this year. Group revenue in 1990 is expected to
increase to more than 160 billion francs, while group
earnings are seen reaching 12 to 13 billion francs.
   Peugeot is scheduled to release 1989 earnings figures
Wednesday.
   The strike at assembly plants in Sochaux and Mulhouse cut
about 60,000 vehicles -- mostly from the 205 and 405 models
-- from the production of main unit Automobiles Peugeot in
1989 and tainted an otherwise positive year for the company.
