   For George Preston, the Lincoln Highway -- that 3,119-mile
stretch between Atlantic City, N.J., and Astoria, Ore. -- is
no lonesome trail.
   That's why the Belle Plaine, Iowa, historian has
established George's Story Line, a 900-line toll-call
telephone service that takes callers down his favorite memory
lane. Unlike some other stories popular with 900-line
callers, Mr. Preston's tales are rousing rather than
arousing.

   And they're all about a highway most drivers know as U.S.
Highway 30 rather than the Abraham Lincoln Highway. (Much of
the highway hasn't officially been called the Lincoln Highway
since the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials started numbering highways in 1926.)
   The 79-year-old Mr. Preston has been gathering lore about
the highway since 1923, when his family purchased a gas
station on it and he began collecting maps from every state
along the route. He then began storing up stories told to him
by tourists and companies doing business on the road. "I've
got stories on every town along the highway," he says.
   Nearly every day, he tapes a three-to-five-minute message
for callers to 900-773-8111. No Garrison Keillor, Mr. Preston
delivers his stories in a gravel-voiced, grammar-wrecking
manner. One minute he rattles on about the first company to
operate a carwash on the highway (Skelly Oil Co.), and the
next he recalls the first president to appear on a Lincoln
Highway map (Herbert Hoover).
   Often, he tells listeners what travel -- and life -- was
like back when motorists had to stop frequently in winter to
refill car radiators with alcohol, the quick-to-evaporate
antifreeze of those times. "I can remember. . . ." a recent
tape began, as he recalled how drivers often got "lost so
bad" along the way that, in Chicago, police had to be
enlisted to "put people back on the highway." He rarely gives
his stories a time frame, preferring simply to say, "back in
them days."
   The line -- which costs callers $1.75 for the first minute
and 75 cents for each succeeding minute -- receives 50 to 100
calls a day. Mr. Preston gives his share of the proceeds to
charities, including a local volunteer fire department and a
new Belle Plaine library.
   And callers get more than old stories. He sends them a
free Lincoln Highway refrigerator magnet and bumper sticker.
