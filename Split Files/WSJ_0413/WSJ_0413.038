   LOS ANGELES -- Robert H. Smith's stock as a manager is
pretty high these days in banking circles. Unfortunately for
Security Pacific Corp.'s new chief executive officer, the
banks' stock price isn't very high.
   That may help explain why the 6-foot-3 Mr. Smith smiles
like a Cheshire cat at the mere mention of troubled crosstown
rival First Interstate Bancorp., which is considered
vulnerable to a takeover. Everyone in banking knows that one
way for Security Pacific to improve its stock price sharply
is to take over First Interstate.

   Mr. Smith knows that, too. "I have said and continue to
say that bringing together First Interstate and Security
Pacific could be a very beneficial transaction for
shareholders, the industry and banking customers," he says.
He rubs his chin and fiddles with his tie, smile broadening.
"But about all I can say beyond that is I'm studying my
options."
   Mr. Smith, 54 years old, took over as chief executive of
the nation's fifth-largest bank in January, succeeding
Richard J. Flamson, who remains chairman. So far, Mr. Smith
has received high marks from analysts for embarking on a
tough reassessment of the bank's far-flung operations, which
are among the most diverse in banking, and for telling
managers that controls must be stricter.
   Moreover, he shares Mr. Flamson's longtime objective of
building Security Pacific, which has $86 billion of assets,
into a super-regional giant that's big and strong enough to
take on both East Coast competitors and global rivals. Mr.
Smith says his goal is to see Security Pacific with banks in
35 states by the end of the decade; currently, it has banks
in six states.
   But Mr. Smith is bedeviled by the same fundamental problem
that frustrated Mr. Flamson during much of his 12-year stint
as chief executive: Despite generally strong performance,
Security Pacific's stock price is stuck at about book value,
a depressed level relative to its earnings. That fouls up a
lot of Mr. Smith's long-term plans, because a higher stock
price makes stock-swap acquisitions cheaper, and purchases
are crucial to Security Pacific's growth. Without a big move
-- such as a deal with First Interstate that would result in
a huge increase in size and ultimately could prove a profit
gusher -- many analysts wonder if Security Pacific can ever
light the necessary fire under its stock needed to make more
purchases.
   Mr. Smith got a distressing reminder of his problem
Wednesday, when the bank reported that first-quarter earnings
rose a healthy 5% to $188.4 million. The stock immediately
drifted downward before leveling off and winding up unchanged
at $35.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading; Wall
Street had been expecting better results. Yesterday, Security
Pacific closed at $36.50, up 62.5 cents.
   In an interview, Mr. Smith dances around the question of
whether Security Pacific would ever make a bid for First
Interstate, which is considered vulnerable because its stock
has been hammered by a string of huge surprise losses in
recent quarters. But it is known that Security Pacific's top
management believes it might be able to cut expenses at a
merged Security Pacific-First Interstate by as much as 30% in
about three years. Given First Interstate's lucrative retail
network and strong California operations, that kind of cost
savings would make a combination into a certain bonanza. "It
would be a real home run," says one of the bank's managers.
   Of course, First Interstate is attempting to restructure
itself and has said it wants to stay independent, so no deal
appears imminent -- with Security Pacific or with other banks
known to be interested in some sort of combination, such as
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and BankAmerica Corp.
   In the meantime, Mr. Smith says, he intends to boost
profits through a combination of squeezing costs,
restructuring low-return businesses and pushing the retail
side of the bank. People who know him say he's particularly
suited to that. Since joining the bank in 1961, he has held a
wide range of positions in many of the bank's major segments,
including heading up the retail banking operation, where he
was renowned as a cost-cutter. "Bob knows this company inside
out," says Mr. Flamson.
   Mr. Smith says he foresees "strong" earnings growth for
the company in 1990. He wouldn't make a specific earnings
estimate. He said the bank's 1990 losses in Arizona, where
the real estate market is moribund, will be "about half" of
1989's $140 million Arizona loss.
   Mr. Smith has already shown he isn't sentimental. Much of
his vision for Security Pacific seems to involve undoing
things for which Mr. Flamson and the bank were known. For
example, he's likely to decrease further its involvment in
capital markets, which Mr. Flamson charged into a few years
ago before beginning a retreat because of poor returns.
   Separately, Security Pacific unveiled a 10-year program
under which it will invest $2.4 billion in community
reinvestment, primarily thorugh lending for low and moderate
income housing and for small and minority-owned businesses.
   Banks are required by law to invest in lower income
communities, but community activists have frequently
complained that large institutions, including Security
Pacific, don't do enough.
   Security Pacific said the funds earmarked for the new
program represent an increase of about 20% annually in the
money it puts into such projects. In 1989, Security Pacific
said, it put $199.7 million into community reinvestment.
   Mr. Smith called the new program an "expression of our
goal and the important priority we place on community
involvement. . . . $2.4 billion is a lot of money."
