   Ivan Boesky is a free man, having served his three-year
sentence in two years. Not everyone got off so easily.
Federal judges in New York have spent recent weeks trying to
graft some concept of proportionality onto several Wall
Street prosecutions.
   Federal appeals judges rapped the wrists of Judge Leonard
Sand for his punitive sentencing of Lisa Jones, the
26-year-old former Drexel Burnham Lambert assistant. Miss
Jones was convicted of perjury and sentenced to 18 months by
Judge Sand, fully half the Boesky term. The appeals court
said Judge Sand shouldn't have added time to her sentence on
his highly dubious assumption that her perjury somehow caused
the prosecutors to expend more resources in their
investigation of Princeton/Newport.

   Perhaps not coincidentally, Rudolph Giuliani's successors
in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan have now decided
to settle for forfeitures of $3 million against
Princeton/Newport officials. The Giuliani team asked for a
whopping $21 million. This is the firm that was RICOed into
liquidation before trial.
   Judge Mary Johnson Lowe recently sentenced James Sherwin,
the former GAF official. "I have been a judge since 1972 and
I can't remember a case that has caused me more anguish in
attempting to fashion an appropriate sentence," Judge Lowe
said. There were three trials and millions spent in legal
fees before the government finally convinced a jury that Mr.
Sherwin had somehow fraudulently caused a 1/8-point movement
in Union Carbide stock several weeks before GAF sold its
shares.
   Judge Lowe called the offense "an aberrational happening."
But she said the jury decision "should be accepted and
respected by this court." So she sentenced Mr. Sherwin to
jail, but for the relatively light sentence of six months.
Judge Lowe earlier had refused to send trader Salim Lewis to
jail at all for his equally controversial alleged stock
manipulation, perhaps because Mr. Lewis pleaded instead of
insisting on going to trial.
   Next up is Judge Pierre Leval, scheduled to sentence
Robert Freeman next Tuesday. Mr. Freeman, recall, was the
Goldman, Sachs partner handcuffed at his desk by Mr.
Giuliani's forces along with fellow arbitragers Richard
Wigton and Timothy Tabor. Prosecutors eventually had to drop
all the original charges against the Giuliani Three, and even
apologized for the too-hasty arrests. Mr. Freeman later
agreed to cop a plea to one count of mail fraud based on the
oblique "Your Bunny has a good nose" line, referring to
problems in a takeover from admitted inside trader Martin
Siegel.
   Judge Leval turned down the prosecution request that in
addition to the single plea to the supposed crime, he take
into account allegations against Mr. Freeman that the
government never tried to prove against him. Mr. Freeman's
lawyers urged in a sentencing memo that jail time is
especially inappropriate because of the "suffering that Mr.
Freeman and his family have been compelled to undergo for the
37 months following the government's precipitous arrest, an
arrest which the government has since acknowledged was a
mistake."
   The granddaddies of disproportionate prosecutions remain
the cases against Drexel and Michael Milken. Drexel is
bankrupt, thousands of people are out of work, credit is
being squeezed in the U.S., yet there is still no trial date
set for Mr. Milken.
   Prosecutors had a good run against Wall Street in the
1980s. Now federal judges are doing their best to see that
some justice is done.
