   WASHINGTON -- President and Mrs. Bush paid $101,382 in
taxes for 1989, the president's new tax return indicates.
   Mr. Bush reported an adjusted gross income of $456,780 for
the year, returns released by the White House indicate. That
income includes $189,167 from his salary as president; $6,229
in salary for the time he spent as vice president in 1989
before his Jan. 20 inauguration; and $208,274 in income from
the Bushes' private trust.

   In addition, a net long-term capital gain of $36,068 from
the blind trust was reported.
   Mr. Bush has placed nearly all his personal holdings into
the blind trust, so the sources of his investment income
aren't disclosed to him nor listed in detail on the tax
return.
   The tax return also shows that Mr. Bush received $14,282
in royalties from his autobiography, "Looking Forward." White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Mr. Bush sent half
the proceeds as a contribution to the United Negro College
Fund and the other half to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston.
   Separately, Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, released tax returns showing they had adjusted gross
income of $133,696 for 1989, and paid federal income taxes of
$25,479. The Quayles' income included $106,526 from his
salary as vice president and $14,572 in dividend income from
Central Newspapers Inc. stock.
