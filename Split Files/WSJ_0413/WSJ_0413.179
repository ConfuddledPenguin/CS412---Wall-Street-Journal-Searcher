   Cincinnati's battle over the Robert Mapplethorpe
photography exhibition highlights a question critical to
defining obscenity: What are the city's "community
standards"?
   The courtroom drama to come will likely provide an unusual
examination of that issue and other legal tests intended to
clarify what has long been fuzzy legal ground.

   The exhibit of 175 works by the late photographer,
including a handful of homoerotic images, opened Saturday at
the Contemporary Arts Center, and a county grand jury
immediately indicted the museum and its director on criminal
obscenity charges. A federal judge Sunday stayed action
against the show until a jury trial is held.
   Hundreds of residents have gone to the streets, protesting
what one sign called "Censor-nati." Other citizens have
conducted letter-writing and telephone campaigns opposing the
exhibit.
   Harvey Zuckman, director of the Institute for
Communications Law Studies at Catholic University in
Washington, says the case could be a milestone for
legislators and artists fighting for understanding and
funding of contemporary art: "For the first time, a judicial
determination that this stuff isn't obscene."
   The outcome of the Mapplethorpe case will be determined by
how a jury applies a 1973 Supreme Court test of obscenity,
which many First Amendment lawyers consider among the most
subjective of legal standards. In Miller vs. California the
court ruled that an obscene work must be deemed by local
community standards to appeal to the prurient interests of
the "average person," to depict sexual activities in a way
"patently offensive" to that person, and must be judged to
have no artistic, literary, scientific or political merit.
   Many First Amendment attorneys expect the museum to
prevail on all counts. They don't think the community
standards issue will be problematic, despite reaction against
the exhibit and Cincinnati's history of aggressive
pornography prosecution. And the museum plans to base its
arguments primarily on the legal test involving "artistic
merit," which these attorneys see as a sure thing.
   In deciding the community standard issue, the jury is
assumed to "reflect" community values, says Marshall Nelson,
partner in Davis Wright Tremaine in Seattle. But the judge
will warn jury members "not to use their own reactions," says
Mr. Zuckman.
   In this test, the prosecution need not prove anything; it
can simply present the work. Hamilton County prosecutor
Arthur Ney wouldn't comment on the case. But Phil Burress, a
spokesman for Citizens for Community Values, which has
campaigned against the show, says he expects the prosecutor
to "lay those photos down in front of the jury."
   Rebuttal is up to the defense. H. Louis Sirkin, an
attorney for the museum, says he expects to call
psychologists to testify that the works wouldn't provoke a
prurient response in "the average person with a healthy
interest in sex." Mr. Sirkin also will point to the thousands
of visitors to the exhibit, say attorneys. In some cases,
lawyers defending a film, for example, have demonstrated
accessibility and tolerance in the community by showing local
box office receipts for a similar work.
   But Mr. Sirkin will also focus on the third test of
obscenity. A work can be judged "as absolutely patently
offensive as you want, but if an expert says it has serious
artistic merit, and the jury agrees, then it's not obscene,"
says Barbara Hoffman, partner in Steckler Hoffman in New
York.
   Both sides are expected to call experts to testify on
whether the work is art. Mr. Sirkin will bring in art
historians and critics, including some from the Midwest. A
1987 Supreme Court case ruled that merit must be judged by
national, not local, standards. The fact that the show is in
a museum, and presented with educational material, will also
be relevant. But there is some debate in the arts community
about Mapplethorpe's work; well-known critic Hilton Kramer
has questioned its status as art.
   One irony to the case: if the material is judged obscene,
its opponents could be liable for prosecution for using
federal mails to distribute it. The Community Values group
has been mailing copies of the photographs to raise the
hackles of sympathizers. Says Mr. Zuckman: "They could be
hoisted on their own petard."
