   Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest
commercial bank, said it plans to set up an investment bank
in Milan, Italy, that will specialize in management and
leveraged buy-outs. The value of the planned investment
wasn't disclosed.
   Union Bank said the move will mark its first direct
presence in the Italian market. It said it decided to
establish a unit that will focus on buy-outs because the bank
"sees interesting business possibilities, especially
involving medium-sized and small companies." A spokeswoman
said that a decision hadn't been made on when the unit will
be established but that three investment banking specialists
have been selected to set up the operation.

   Union Bank also said its 20% stake in Banco Internazionale
Lombarda of Milan won't be effected by the new investment
banking unit, because the Italian institution isn't active in
equity holdings, but concentrates instead on capital markets,
asset management, foreign exchange, treasuries, and hedging
instruments.
