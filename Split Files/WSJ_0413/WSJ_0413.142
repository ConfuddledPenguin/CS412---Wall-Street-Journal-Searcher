   Famous Restaurants Inc. said its improved earnings and the
troubled nature of the high-yield, high-risk "junk" bond
market mean that its chairman, president and chief executive
officer, Dennis B. Mullen, is no longer considering a
leveraged buy-out of the Scottsdale, Ariz., operator of
Mexican and seafood restaurants.
   In February, Mr. Mullen said he and possibly other
management members were exploring the feasibility of a
buy-out. Mr. Mullen said he hadn't made a specific offer for
the company.

   The company said preliminary results for the first 12
weeks of this year reflect earnings of $312,000, up sharply
from $36,000 a year earlier. Revenue rose 30% to $23.7
million from $18.2 million. Earnings were buoyed by the
acquisition last May of the Casa Lupita restaurant chain,
divestiture of unprofitable restaurants, and the opening of
other restaurants, Mr. Mullen said.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Famous
Restaurants shares closed at $1.50, down 6.25 cents.
