   WORK AND PLAY

   A University of Michigan study of how much time various
nationalities spend at work and at play shows that Japan lags
behind the U.S. in leisure time.
   American men spend on average 20.5 hours a week at
leisure, compared with 13.3 hours taken by Japanese men,
according to the study. The disparity is even greater between
American women, who take 21.8 hours of time out each week for
leisure, and Japanese women, who take just 10.6 hours.
   The study was based on surveys conducted between 1964 and
1987 in the U.S., Japan, the Soviet Union, Finland, Hungary,
Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Among other findings, it reported
that the work week ranged from 54 hours in the Soviet Union
to 33.4 hours in Denmark.
   Soviet women spent more time working than women in the
other countries, averaging 39.3 hours a week on the job and
27 hours a week doing housework. American women averaged 23.9
hours a week on the job and 30.5 hours a week working at
home.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA PARDONS BOMBER
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean cabinet agreed to pardon a North Korean
agent condemned to hang for blowing up a Korean Air Lines
jetliner in 1987 and killing all 115 people on board.
Officials said President Roh Tae Woo would soon release
28-year-old Kim Hyun Hui on the grounds she was both a pawn
and a victim of the communist North. Seoul's Supreme Court
last month had upheld the death sentence.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S PRESSURED STUDENTS
                                                                                                       

   The pressure of college-entrance exams has led to more
class hours and required courses in Japan's public high
schools, the Education Ministry said. According to a ministry
survey of Japan's 3,893 public high schools, 12.4% require
more than 35 hours of classes per week, up from 7.9% in 1982,
when the ministry urged high schools to reduce classes to 32
hours per week. The ministry also wants schools to limit
their academic year to 35 weeks, but 65.7% of the high
schools had more than 35 weeks of classes, the ministry said.
                                                                                                       

   ITALIAN BANK ACCORD
                                                                                                       

   After eight months of negotiations, the Federation of
Italian Banks and unions representing 320,000 bank employees
reached an accord in principle over a new, four-year labor
contract. The contract calls for an average monthly pay
increase of 356,000 lire ($289) and an extension of bank
opening hours to 35.5 hours a week from the current 32.5
hours. The unions have also agreed to keep banks open to 6:30
p.m. once a week to accommodate working people.
                                                                                                       

   KLM FARE CUT
                                                                                                       

   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is cutting the price of tickets
bought in the Netherlands for destinations in the U.S. The
reduced fare on a round-trip flight to New York from
Amsterdam will be 1,000 guilders ($530), compared with the
current fare of 1,400 guilders. The reduced fare for a
round-trip flight to Los Angeles will be 1,400 guilders,
compared with the current 1,734 guilders. A spokesman for the
airline said the move will coincide with a KLM campaign that
will advertise tourism to the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   SPEEDING ACROSS TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's cabinet approved the nation's largest public
project ever: construction of a high-speed railway system
across the island to relieve congested traffic on the
north-south freeway. Officials said the railway would cost
279.2 billion Taiwan dollars ($10.66 billion) and would be
built over 10 years. The 225-mile elevated rail will link
Taipei with the southern port of Kaohsiung. Travel between
the two cities will take 105 minutes on the high-speed train,
compared with five hours on the present railway line.
                                                                                                       

   SAFETY OF EUROPEAN FERRIES
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission is considering action to
remedy what many see as lax ferry-safety standards.
   Last weekend's disaster aboard the Danish-owned
Scandinavian Star underscored the need for harmonization and
toughening of design and safety procedures throughout the EC,
commission officials say.
   Member states in the past have rejected commission
proposals, arguing that the matter is best left to the
International Maritime Organization. Britain, however, has
been enforcing tougher ferry standards in the wake of the
Herald of Free Enterprise disaster off the Belgian coast
three years ago and is urging EC action.
   Responding to the deadly fire on the Bahamas-registered
Scandinavian Star, a maritime commission from Norway, Sweden
and Denmark decided to tighten inspection procedures for
foreign-flagged ships in Scandinavian waters.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Billionaire businessman Yoshiaki Tsutsumi said he would
resign as president of Japan's Olympic Committee to take
responsibility for a mix-up in national anthems at last
month's Asian Winter Games in Sapporo. During the games,
Japanese officials erroneously played the Mongolian and North
Korean anthems at a medal ceremony for a South Korean
speed-skater. . . . Only hours before ex-King Michael of
Romania was scheduled to fly from Geneva to Bucharest, the
Romanian government canceled his visa and asked Swissair not
to let him board the flight. The airline complied.
