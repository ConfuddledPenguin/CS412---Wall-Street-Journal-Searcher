   TOKYO -- Japan's steel production in March grew 2% from a
year earlier to 9.16 million metric tons, the Japan Iron and
Steel Federation said. This brought output in the year ended
March 31 to 108.1 million metric tons, the fifth-highest
level in history, up 2.3% from fiscal 1989.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. Steel
production exceeded the 100 million metric-ton level for the
third consecutive year. The steel industry was supported
strongly throughout the latest fiscal year by robust domestic
demand as Japan's economy continued to expand, a federation
official said.

   Production in March also represented an 11% increase from
February, when output fell 0.9% from a year earlier, the
first year-to-year decline in 12 months. The quick recovery
in March indicates the underlying trend toward higher
production continues, the official said.
