   Milwaukee County, Wis. -- $53 million general obligation
corporate purpose bonds, Series 1990 A, due Dec. 1,
1991-2009, apparently were won by a Prudential-Bache Capital
Funding group. The bonds, rated single-A-1 by Moody's
Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp., were priced for reoffering to yield from 6% in
1991 to 7.35% in 2008 and 2009. There are no term bonds.
