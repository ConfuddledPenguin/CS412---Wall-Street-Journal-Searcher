   Holders of a majority of the $270 million in junk bonds
issued by Univision Holdings have voted to accept a sweetened
tender offer from Hallmark Cards Inc., a bondholder
representative said.
   Hallmark, which holds a 63.5% equity stake in Univision,
earlier this month had threatened that Univision would file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection if the modified bid,
which still steeply discounts the bonds, wasn't accepted.

   The offer was slated to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT today.
   Wilbur Ross, the senior managing director of Rothschild
Inc. who represents holders of a majority of Univision's two
debt issues, said, "We are endorsing both the total amount of
dollars put on the table and the allocation of those dollars"
between classes.
   He said the vote makes it "a foregone conclusion the
tender offer will be a success," but he added that it's
unclear whether Hallmark will get tenders for the 90% of each
class it has been seeking.
   A Hallmark spokeswoman said the company is pleased with
the holders' decision but declined to comment further until
the tendered shares have been counted.
   Hallmark launched the tender offer in February after
Univision, the nation's biggest Spanish-language broadcast
concern, missed interest payments. The closely held Kansas
City, Mo., greeting-card concern created Univision with
partner First Chicago Corp., paying about $600 million for
eight television stations and the Univision network with
funds from the junk-bond offering and bank borrowings.
   Hallmark's original bid was widely seen as a low offer and
drew only a small fraction of the bonds despite repeated
extensions. As modified, the bid calls for holders of
Univision's $165 million in senior subordinated notes due
1998 to get 55.3 cents on each dollar of face amount, up from
45 cents earlier. Holders of $105 million in subordinated
debentures due 1999 will receive an aggregate of 37.95 cents
in principal plus accrued interest on each dollar of face
amount, up from 30 cents.
   Hallmark plans to hold the junk bonds and defer interest
payments due for several years.
   Hallmark has also reached a pact with a bank group headed
by Continental Bank Corp. under which the lenders loosened
terms on $315 million in loans to Univision. In addition, it
reached agreement with First Chicago, under which the
Univision co-owner will give up veto power and make other
concessions to Hallmark in exchange for provisions that will
tend to protect First Chicago's financial investment.
