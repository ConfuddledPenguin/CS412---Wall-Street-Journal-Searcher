   JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON (East Brunswick, N.J.) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it affirmed this health care company's
triple-A senior debt and related ratings following
announcement of a $125 million charge against its Latin
American operations. S&amp;P said the "largely noncash charge
reflects costs mainly incurred in Argentina and Brazil,"
while the company's global diversification "limits the impact
of any one economy."
