   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- American Savings Bank said it is
seeking a buyer for its AmSave Credit Corp. unit, which
specializes in commercial and lease financing.
   William G. Lillis, president and chief executive of
American Savings, said the move was in keeping with the
company's back-to-basics strategy. "We are focusing on our
core businesses, income-property lending and retail banking,"
said Mr. Lillis in a statement. "Our commitment to sell
AmSave is a major step toward the implementation of this
strategy."
