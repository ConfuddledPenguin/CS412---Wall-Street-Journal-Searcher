   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision placed
First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Warner Robins, Ga.,
in government receivership.
   First Federal, with $157.5 million in assets, was
insolvent primarily because of delinquent commercial real
estate loans and poor underwriting practices, the agency
said. As of Dec. 31, the thrift held $28.9 million in
delinquent loans, and was operating unsafely, the regulators
said.

   The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal government's S&amp;L
bailout agency, will act as receiver. First Federal will
remain open for business, and deposits of as much as $100,000
remain insured.
