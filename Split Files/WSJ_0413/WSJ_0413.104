   NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp.'s first-quarter net
income rose 29%, as the bank cut costs and its provision for
loan losses, while Bank of New York Co.'s net edged up 1.3%
despite a higher provision.
   Chemical's net climbed to $151.7 million, or $1.55 a
share, from $117.9 million, or $1.49 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Per-share profit reflected an offering
of 16.1 million shares in November.

   Interest the bank received on loans declined 12% on
factors including lower payments from Brazil and Mexico on
medium-term and long-term loans.
   Also, revenue from sources other than interest would have
been flat but for a $114.7 million gain before tax on the
sale of the bank's warrants and common stock in Florida
National Banks of Florida Inc.
   Frank DeSantis Jr., analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc.,
noted that Chemical was able to pare expenses, and its
provision for loan losses dropped to $70 million from $90.7
million. The provision for loan losses at the Texas Commerce
unit took "a big positive swing" to $15 million from $39
million, he said.
   Charge-offs of loans at the parent fell to $58 million
from $78.5 million, the bank said.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc. cut its ratings on a number
of Chemical Banking's securities, including the senior debt
to triple-B-plus from single-A-minus. The downgrades,
affecting $540 million of debt and $200 million of preferred
stock, reflect "a weakened operating environment" in
Chemical's primary markets, the New York metro area and the
Northeast.
   Bank of New York earnings rose to $102.3 million, or $1.38
a share, from $101.1 million, or $1.45 a share on fewer
shares a year earlier. The provision for loan losses climbed
to $63 million from $42 million in the year-earlier period.
   The bank said the return on average assets in the latest
period was nearly flat at 0.86% compared with 0.85%. The
year-to-year quarterly comparisons are the first that fully
take into account Bank of New York's merger with Irving
Trust, which was completed in December 1988.
   Chairman J. Carter Bacot said the company reduced loans
outstanding to less-developed countries to $552 million by
selling loans totaling $171 million, by reducing its Mexican
exposure by $86 million, and by charging off $31 million for
Argentine debt.
   The loss allowance for less-developed-country loans is
$330 million, or about 60% of the total loans outstanding.
Nonperforming assets at March 31, 1990, totaled $1.19
billion, essentially unchanged from Dec. 31, 1989.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chemical Bank's stock rose $1, to $24.375 a share, while Bank
of New York's slipped 37.5 cents, to $31.375.
