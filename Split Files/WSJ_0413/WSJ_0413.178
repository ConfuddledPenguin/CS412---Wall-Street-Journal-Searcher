   As president of Carnegie Mellon University, Richard Cyert
helped start a higher-education trend toward hotter pursuit
of corporate research funding.
   During Mr. Cyert's 17-year tenure, the Pittsburgh school
has tapped Digital Equipment Corp., Eastman Kodak Co.,
International Business Machines Corp., Westinghouse Electric
Corp. and many others. In the process, Carnegie Mellon's
research budget grew at one of the fastest rates of any U.S.
university -- to $121 million in the 1988-89 academic year
from $13 million when Mr. Cyert became president in 1972.

   But lately, Mr. Cyert says, Carnegie Mellon has turned
more to foreign companies -- even in projects originally
meant to give the U.S. a boost. In June, Mr. Cyert plans to
step down as president to return to Carnegie Mellon's
faculty, as head of an institute to study international
management. In a recent interview with staff reporter Gary
Putka, he faulted both business management and business
schools for some of the country's competitive ills. Here are
highlights:
                                                                                                       

   How has U.S. competitiveness changed in the years that
you've been leading Carnegie Mellon?
   There have been two phases. Up to about the last five
years, there hasn't been any question but that American
competitiveness has been going downhill. Over the last five
years there are signs we're moving in a better direction.
   Part of the blame goes to universities. Before World War
II, we had industrial-engineering departments. They taught
things like time-and-motion studies and plant layout. While
they weren't strong academic departments, they turned out a
lot of people who thought of their job as improving the
manufacturing process.
   Business schools came along at the end of World War II and
started using a lot of mathematical techniques, and they
drove these industrial engineering departments out of
existence. Then business schools began to concentrate on
marketing and finance. So for a long time there were very few
people being turned out who viewed themselves as
manufacturing people. The Japanese, on the contrary, turn out
scads of industrial engineers, and they don't have very many
business schools. As a former dean of a business school I
don't like to say that, but there's a big element there that
has hurt us.
                                                                                                       

   What are the hopeful signs?
   A lot of schools have gotten interested in manufacturing.
Business schools are joining more closely with the
engineering schools in trying to develop programs. Firms are
getting more interested in manufacturing. In the past, when a
firm came around recruiting, {students} interested in
manufacturing would get much lower salaries. That's changing.
   We see companies like Ford that are really interested in
improving quality and the cost of manufacturing automobiles.
There's a larger amount of research dollars coming into the
universities that has manufacturing implications.
                                                                                                       

   Are foreign corporations ahead of U.S. companies in
recognizing the value of American university research?
   I believe they are. They have a better feel for being able
to read something and transfer that knowledge to
applications. If you go into a Japanese operation, you'll
find as much as two to three hours a day is spent by
supervisors and others in production in reading the journals
and trying to get ideas that can be applied. Almost every
idea they have adopted has been in the academic literature.
The same thing is true of the Germans.
   The second point is that they are much more interested in
finding out what is going on in academic institutions. We
have many more representatives of foreign firms coming around
to our robotics institute, wanting to talk to our
computer-science people and our electrical-engineering
people, than we do American firms. We go out and drag in some
American firms.
                                                                                                       

   Weren't you persuaded recently to take on some foreign
corporate research partners instead of American ones?
   We have a project where we're trying to develop the
ability to get a machine to translate language. We're
particularly interested in being able to speak into the
machine in Japanese, and have it translate in English and
vice versa. We've had difficulty in getting real interest
from American firms on it. I went to Japan, took along some
people from this project, and we put on some seminars. We got
significant support from the Japanese. Hitachi was a major
contributor. Matsushita also has gotten very interested. We
also have some Japanese scientists working on the project.
They're our Ph.D.s -- Japanese who got their Ph.D.s {at
Carnegie Mellon}.
   We started out in our robotics institute with the notion
that the Japanese would be excluded. It was my view in 1980
that our robotics institute could contribute to the saving of
American manufacturing. We got some support from American
firms, but we could not get the total support we needed. I
have now been much more willing to listen to Japanese firms,
and we're expecting some significant support from Japanese
firms. Siemens {of West Germany} has also been taken in. In
general, American firms will not support basic research.
                                                                                                       

   Haven't we seen more abuses in academic research since
business has become more involved?
   I wouldn't say the abuses have come from a relationship
between industries and universities. The abuses have come
from the fact that in many areas, more faculty members have
had business opportunities, and university administrations
have been lax. So you have the question of: Will that person
publish his results of his research, or does he want to hold
them back for proprietary purposes for his firm? The amount
of time spent on the firm may be shortchanging the students.
   You do have to be careful, however, about the intertwining
of business and the universities in that it's extremely
important for universities to do basic research, because it
isn't being done by the firms. The more businesses become
involved and emphasize short-run results -- applied research
-- you tend to divert the faculty from basic research.
                                                                                                       

   Has the great post-World War II American business school
expansion been a failure?
   I wouldn't say it's been a failure, but certainly its weak
spots have been exposed. Our business schools have let down
society by not doing a better job of truly studying
management. Looking at human resources and human-resource
development, looking at questions of how you improve
productivity, how you involve your work force to do a better
job -- these are the kinds of things we should have been
doing.
                                                                                                       

   Yet places like Yale are de-emphasizing the organizational
approach.
   I think that's a serious error. What's happening there is
those whom I'll call more discipline-oriented are in large
enough numbers so that they've driven the others out. Anyone
who's looking at management has to really lament what
happened there. The whole organization area -- even if you
can't develop strong theorems in that area -- is a crucial,
crucial area, and I think one abandons that at one's peril.
