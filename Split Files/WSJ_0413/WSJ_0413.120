   CINCINNATI -- The judge overseeing the bankruptcy-court
proceedings of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. approved an employee retention plan designed to
keep key managers from defecting from the retail companies.
   The plan will affect about 2,300 of Federated and Allied's
approximately 101,000 employees. They will be offered
employment contracts, termination agreements, enhanced
severance pay and bonuses. Federated and Allied, which are
units of Campeau Corp., filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code Jan. 15.

   The plan approved by U.S. bankruptcy court Judge J.
Vincent Aug Jr. will cost the companies about $10.6 million
in the first year and $11 million in the second year,
according to documents filed in federal bankruptcy court
here. In addition, $5 million a year will be available for
discretionary bonuses. Heads of stores, merchandise managers
and corporate vice presidents will be covered by the plan.
