   Tim W. Ferguson's March 6 Business World, "Prop. 65
Populism Is on the Prowl, but Don't Cry Wolf," gives
excellent insight into the elements of cancer causation and
thence the prevention desired so ardently by the proponents
of Proposition 65 in California and elsewhere. It turns out
that the goals of Prop. 65 to control cancer will not be met
at all through the expensive actions required by law in
California. Excellent, reliable and validated international
research on cancer causation provides the evidence for this
erroneous approach through Prop. 65.
   In the U.S. and the Western world generally, about 30% of
cancer deaths, specifically cancer in the lung, pancreas,
kidney, bladder and to some extent in the cervix, are
definitely associated with and caused by smoking of
cigarettes. About 5% of cancer deaths in the oral cavity and
esophagus are due to smoking and alcohol consumption or
chewing of tobacco. The traditional Western nutrition, high
in fat, low in fiber, and high in salt accounts for more than
50% of cancer deaths at important sites, such as the colon,
postmenopausal breast, pancreas (with smoking), ovary, uterus
and prostate.

   Clearly, the agents regulated by Prop. 65 are not on this
list. People believe they are protected by such legislation
and tragically they are not. What is needed is a change in
life style, which is slowly taking place. There are fewer men
smokers. As a result, the rate of fatal heart attacks (also
caused by smoking) has begun to drop, as has lung cancer in
men but not women. People have started to switch to lower-fat
foods but not to a sufficient degree to make a difference.
Existing data clearly show that a fat intake for cancer
prevention needs to be about 20% of calories rather than the
current 38%.
   Federal and state agencies find it easy to ban basically
innocuous and actually useful chemicals such as saccharin.
What is needed is for legislators and all concerned in the
consumer and environmental movements to be better informed
about causes of cancer, heart disease and stroke -- the major
killers in America -- so that appropriate effective actions
can be instituted to avoid the major part of the 500,000
annual cancer deaths.

   Mr. Ferguson asks if a regulation focused on identifying
trace levels of industrial chemicals that may cause cancer in
animals is "the best use of social capital." Clearly, if
one's goal is the reduction of human cancer mortality,
trace-chemical witch hunts are totally cost-ineffective.
   The premise of Prop. 65 in California -- that chemicals
that cause cancer in high doses in laboratory experiments
must be assumed to cause cancer in humans -- is antithetical
to the science of cancer epidemiology, which focuses on the
established causes of human cancer (among them, tobacco use;
alcohol abuse; overexposure to sunlight; radiation; certain
occupational and pharmaceutical chemicals; and specific
sexual and reproductive patterns, including multiple sexual
partners, which increase a woman's risk of cervical cancer;
and delayed age at first birth, which in some way augments
the chances of breast cancer).
   In judging cost-effectiveness of labeling foods, cosmetics
and other consumer products that may contain trace amounts of
a chemical that in high doses is an animal carcinogen, one
must ask how many cases of cancer are attributable to these
exposures? The actual answer here is unknown -- but the best
guess is zero.
   Clearly, tobacco products account for one-third of cancer
mortality in the U.S. and a label on these products is
appropriate. But are other labels really needed and
effective? For those who are "warning-philic" one might argue
that labeling beach chairs and swimsuits as to the dangers of
ultraviolet rays would be far more effective in reducing
cancer incidence than sounding an alarm about the latest
animal carcinogen of the week.
