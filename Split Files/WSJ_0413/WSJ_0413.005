   Frederick F. Reichheld addressed the issue of loss of
customers by a company due to dissatisfaction with a product
or service (Manager's Journal, March 12). He says, "Few
companies make customer retention part of their business
objectives." Very true. Responsible executives wax eloquent
about quality and customer service in staff meetings and
memos. Management consultants exhort their clients to make
"customer service" their top priority. But nobody, in my
opinion, seems to address the fundamentals behind quality and
customer service.
   While organizational experts cry their hearts out
emphasizing that the most important asset of a company is its
human resources (i.e., its employees), the decimation and
demoralization of the American work force during the 1980s by
a spectrum of companies have made their (surviving) employees
very bitter. Employees try to do everything to retain their
jobs, but they do not have single-minded commitment to
enhance quality or serve the customer better since they
constantly live with the fear of losing their jobs regardless
of how well they perform their tasks.

   Quality of product or service is the result of actions of
motivated employees. If fear and authority, rather than
respect and reward, rule over the employees in an
organization, then quality and service are bound to become
casualties. Where are the management consultants? Are the
consultants advising their clients about this serious issue?
If so, what is the response? If not, why not?
