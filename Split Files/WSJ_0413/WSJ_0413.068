   CHICAGO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed $9.5
billion of debt issued by Household International Inc., one
of the nation's largest consumer finance companies, on review
for possible downgrade, because of concerns about expansion
strategies, holdings in commercial real estate and highly
leveraged transactions.
   The rating concern cited Household's planned growth
strategy and the potentially risky assets of its main
operating unit, Household Finance Corp.

   News of the possible downgrade sent Household shares
tumbling $2.75, to $46.50 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, when turnover in the issue was
stopped by the exchange, pending news from the company, but
trading in the issue didn't resume. In a detailed statement
released before the market closed, Household denounced
Moody's assessment.
   Household has been building a large regional thrift
organization through its Household Bank unit, aimed at
customers with a higher income level than that targeted by
Household Finance, a leading consumer loan company. Moody's
said this project has entailed heavy infrastructure and
acquisition costs, including an increased dependence on
short-term borrowed funds and a rise in what the industry
calls corporate good will -- premium prices paid for bank or
savings assets that cover customer additions, location and
staff recognition but are carried on the negative side of
cash balance sheets.
   Moody's also said it will evaluate the adequacy of
Household's capital basis, including that of each of its
units. In the past two years, Household has spun off its
manufacturing interests to concentrate on financial services.
   Household's chairman and chief executive officer, Donald
C. Clark, said in a statement that he is "very disappointed"
with Moody's action. Substantial investments in new business
have contributed to consistently higher earnings by
Household, according to Mr. Clark's statement. Household last
year earned $239.5 million, including $21.1 million in
discontinued operations, or $6.47 a share, compared with the
year-earlier $246.7 million, including $63 million in
discontinued operations, or $6.80 a share.
   Earnings of Household Bank were positive last year, Mr.
Clark's statement said, and are expected to increase this
year. Good will is being written off over an aggressive
schedule of eight to 10 years, he said.
   Household's commercial real estate portfolio totaled $720
million, or less than 3% of $26.2 billion in assets at the
end of last year, according to Mr. Clark. He said the
portfolio is well-diversified geographically and by type of
property, and has little exposure in the Northeast and none
in New England.
   Highly leveraged transactions are focused in an
acquisition finance portfolio totaling $1.1 billion, or 4% of
assets, Mr. Clark said. The majority of these credits are
secured through senior debt, and Household hasn't experienced
any credit losses in the area, he said.
   Household's statement also took a jab at Moody's for
giving seven times as many downgrades as upgrades among
financial institutions rated in the 1990 first quarter.
   Analysts expressed sympathy for Household's position.
"Moody's never tells a company what it expects ahead of
time," said Lawrence W. Eckenfelder, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco. He
estimated that, even if negotiations between Household and
Moody's couldn't prevent a downgrade, Household earnings
wouldn't drop by more than five to 10 cents a share.
   Robert B. Albertson, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
called the Moody's move "an overreaction to the {phrase},
highly leveraged transaction. Household is a very strong
company with a very positive strategy that will decrease its
reliance on leverage through the planned growth of Household
Bank."
   "Household has one of the best records in the industry in
consumer and commercial finance, especially consumer
finance," Mr. Albertson said. "Moody's is just missing the
most important part of the picture."
   Moody's spokesmen were unavailable to comment.
   Moody's rates Household's senior debt at single-A-3 and
Household Finance's senior debt single-A-1. Also under review
are shelf registrations, subordinated notes, preferred stock
and commercial paper for Household International and
Household Finance; Euronotes issued by Household Finance
Corp. Ltd. (Canada); and preferred stock of Household Global
Funding Inc.
