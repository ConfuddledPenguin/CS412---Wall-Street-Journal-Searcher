   Paramount Pictures made peace with bargain-theater owners
by slightly modifying a pricing formula adopted last summer
that exhibitors said would force them to charge more at the
box office.
   After the policy took effect with the release of
Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," some
discount movie theaters stopped screening Paramount films.
Now most of them are expected to resume showing Paramount
films without raising prices.

   It looks as if the hiatus hurt the theater operators more
than Paramount, one industry observer said.
   Practically speaking, the change will make most Paramount
movies available to discount movie houses four months after
they are released, a month sooner than under last summer's
policy.
   Paramount Communications Inc.'s film unit said the revised
policy strikes a balance that meets discount movie theater
owners' needs and "allows us a fair return on our enormous
investments" in the films. Movie makers have complained that
discount theaters cannibalize first-run theaters. Discounters
say their customers wouldn't be going to the movies at all if
their prices, $1 to $2, weren't so low.
   Paramount's revised pricing formula specifies that films
are available on a percentage of box-office gross basis four
months after theatrical release. The old formula required a
per-capita payment up until 30 days before videocassette
release. Under the per-capita payment requirement, a theater
owner must pay the studio $1.05 for each adult admission (75
cents for children and senior citizens) or 35%, whichever is
higher.
