   Everest &amp; Jennings International Ltd. said it expects to
post a $41 million, or $5-a-share, net loss for 1989 and said
it needs a $55 million credit line and a $15 million cash
infusion to continue operating.
   Barre L. Rorabaugh, president and chief executive officer
of the maker of wheelchairs and other medical equipment, said
he was "very confident" that the company could work out the
credit line and cash infusion.

   The Camarillo, Calif., company attributed the
larger-than-anticipated year-end loss to operating and
restructuring costs. It said new product startup costs in the
U.S. and delays in new product shipments, a $2.2 million
write-down in inventories in the United Kingdom and a
provision against a note receivable also contributed to the
loss. The loss includes $15 million in costs for
restructuring the company's manufacturing, marketing and
financial operations.
   For 1988, the company had net income of $2 million, or 25
cents a share. The company said sales were about $187
million, compared with 1988 sales of $191.2 million.
Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a Hong Kong investment
firm, has said it controls 56.6% of Everest &amp; Jennings. It is
70%-owned by Brierley Investments Ltd., a publicly traded New
Zealand-based firm.
