   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered the credit
ratings of 155 companies in the first quarter -- nearly three
times as many as the number of companies given higher credit
ratings.
   S&amp;P said preliminary figures show it lowered ratings on
$75 billion of debt in the first quarter, while raising
ratings for $41 billion of debt issued by 55 companies. The
credit-rating service cited negative trends for junk-bond
issuers as one reason for the downgrades affecting industrial
companies.

   Among U.S. financial-services companies, reduced credit
ratings exceeded the number of improved ratings for real
estate, life-insurance and health-insurance companies. Rating
changes for banks were "decidedly negative," S&amp;P said,
because of sharp increases in bad loans for real
estate-related ventures.
   Separately, S&amp;P said municipal credit quality deteriorated
in the first quarter, largely reflecting downgrades on debt
ratings of New York State and Connecticut and their agencies.
   S&amp;P said ratings on $23.8 billion of municipal debt were
lowered, while ratings on $1.4 billion of debt were raised.
In the quarter, 87 ratings were lowered, while 29 were
raised, compared with 61 lower ratings in the fourth quarter
and 50 upgrades.
