   TOKYO -- Seventeen years ago, when Southland Corp. came to
Japan to spread its 7-Eleven chain, Japanese retailers
eagerly took notes and diligently tried to emulate the new
concept. Now, the student thinks it can give its old teacher
a few lessons.
   The agreement last month by 7-Eleven Japan Co. and its
parent, Ito-Yokado Co., to buy 75% of Southland for $400
million suggests that retailers may be ready to do what
Japanese manufacturers have long been famous for: taking an
American concept, attacking it with ruthless efficiency, and
managing it better than the creator.

   "When it comes to coming up with new business concepts,
Americans are No. 1," says Koichi Hori, vice president and
director of Boston Consulting Group Inc. But, he says, "after
a few years, the Japanese become better at it."
   Like Ito-Yokado, other Japanese chains are starting to buy
American operations. A few months ago, Kyotaru Co., a
700-unit takeout sushi and restaurant chain, agreed to pay
$105 million for Restaurant Associates Inc., which owns a
number of well-known restaurants in the U.S., including Mamma
Leone's. Five years ago, Skylark Co., Japan's biggest
family-restaurant chain, bought hamburger chain Red Robin,
which has 57 outlets in the U.S. Sales have grown at around
8% for the past few years, says a Skylark spokesman.
   Taking the adapted principles of success in Japan back to
the U.S. is no easy task. Japanese chains must manage U.S.
personnel differently, says Ernest Higa, executive vice
president of Y. Higa Corp, which operates Domino's Pizza
here. "They should be very, very concerned about the people
issue."
   For 7-Eleven Japan, the cultural hurdle is just one the
company must clear. It is assuming a portion of the debt load
that led Southland to sell the stake in the first place.
Competition from Circle K Corp. and National Convenience
Stores Inc., among others, is tough, and many gasoline
retailers have entered the fray by adding convenience outlets
to their pumps.
   Just what 7-Eleven Japan intends to do to the U.S.
operations isn't clear. "It's a complete blank piece of
paper," says Hidetoshi Akiyama, a spokesman for the Japanese
chain.
   Analysts agree that the Japanese methods can't be
implemented directly to the U.S. operations. The hallmark of
Japanese management style, however, isn't jumping in with
strategies to restructure companies they bought but spending
time and money researching and making adjustments, analysts
say.
   The key to success for 7-Eleven Japan, which estimates
sales at 780 billion yen ($4.9 billion) for the year ended
Feb. 28, is a centralized computer system that links its
3,940 stores nationwide. The chain took up the system eight
years ago. Instead of simply logging sales data, 7-Eleven
used the computer to chart consumer trends.
   "We found for the first time that we had to change the
range of products we had for every single store," not just by
region or size of the store, says Mr. Akiyama. Outlets near
schools should have a large stock of boxed lunches, for
example, while stores in residential areas sell more
groceries.
   Sales data were coordinated with the chain's computerized
delivery system. As a result, 7-Eleven stocked some of its
stores as often as three times a day, keeping inventory small
and ensuring that the sandwiches and rice balls were fresh.
   Data on deliveries helped 7-Eleven spot potential new
business, Mr. Akiyama says. Noting that many
convenience-store shoppers were young, single Japanese doing
their shopping after the banks were closed, the stores
started accepting payment of gas and electricity bills. The
Japanese stores, however, don't have bank teller machines, as
many of the U.S. outlets do. But the Japanese stores handle
overnight delivery packages and will start accepting
insurance forms for mopeds in the next few months.
   The Japanese chain intends to spend 10 billion yen on
further improvements for the computer system in the next few
months. Southland barely has the system past the experimental
stage. Southland has said that debt costs have kept it from
investing in computers as it would like.
   Now, 7-Eleven Japan hopes to introduce the system to the
7,000 Southland stores in the U.S. and Canada. The company
won't comment on how much the implementation will cost, or
how soon it will be done. Analysts say that although 7-Eleven
Japan and Ito-Yokado are both cash-rich companies, they first
must get Southland's financial house in order.
   Like 7-Eleven, other U.S.-born chains such as Denny's and
Mister Donut, which developed in Japan through ties with
Japanese companies, are surpassing the American operations in
sales per store.
   Denny's Japan Co., a 343-store chain also in the
Ito-Yokado Group, bought the Japanese operation in 1984 from
the American chain. The Japanese chain installed a computer
system in all its restaurants and used it to create a wider
variety of menus than in the U.S. chain. It also instructs
waitresses to serve a glass of water and give a hot towel to
every customer that arrives. "The Japanese are concerned
about little details," says Ichiro Yamamoto, a Denny's
spokesman.
   Average sales for a Japanese Denny's totaled 223 million
yen last year ($1.4 million) while the American Denny's
averaged about $1 million, says Mr. Yamamoto, even though
U.S. outlets are larger and more of them are open 24 hours
than in Japan. Now, a regular program brings American Denny's
managers to Japan to study the menus and services.
   Duskin Co., Japan's biggest chain operation, started the
Mister Donut chain in Japan under a licensing agreement. The
company says profits improved six years ago after it bought
the Japanese operations from International Multifoods Corp.
of the U.S. Sales growth rose by as much as 25% a year,
rising especially in new outlets styled after American diners
of the 1950s, complete with jukeboxes and checkered floors.
Monthly sales per Japanese outlet average 10 million yen,
says a Duskin spokesman, or 2.5 times as much as an American
outlet.
   International Multifoods offered to sell the entire chain
to Duskin, but the Japanese company decided not to bid for
it. "It's easy to draw a picture on a blank canvas, but it's
harder to draw on top of somebody else's work," says
Shigeharu Komai, Duskin's president. Instead, the company
decided to expand into Asia, buying operating rights in the
region.
   Japanese chain operators in general believe that major
American presences, such as McDonald's and Kentucky Fried
Chicken, provide better service in Japan than they do in the
U.S. "Here, the consumer is more demanding," says Mr. Higa of
Domino's Pizza, noting that Japanese fast food outlets have
more workers behind the counters than in the U.S. "The
consumer orientation is toward better service."
   7-Eleven Japan is confident that it can turn around its
ailing parent company and expand in the new market. "When we
first learned the know-how from Southland, we didn't apply
everything exactly as they did," says Toshifumi Suzuki, the
president of 7-Eleven Japan. Now, as the Japanese chain gives
advice to the U.S., he says, "we have to think about how
things should be in the U.S."
