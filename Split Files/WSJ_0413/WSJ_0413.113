   Louis deSabla thinks he knows why his New Age newspaper,
Pathways, is prospering while some businesses that promote
natural foods, personal growth and other rituals of the
neo-1960s life style have flopped.
   The Takoma Park, Md., publisher doesn't let his idealism
blur the bottom line. "People out there in New Age
never-never land expect God to create their income," he says.
"It never works."

   To some, the label "New Age" brings to mind latter-day
flower children eating alfalfa sprouts and listening to
terminally mellow recordings of ocean waves and whale mating
calls. But entrepreneurs such as the 38-year-old Mr. deSabla
are focusing on age-old business methods as well as New Age
brown-rice recipes.
   As they evolve, the entrepreneurs are thriving. "I've
gotten to be a little more of a capitalist," says Mr.
deSabla. "My daughter goes to private school and I drive a
Volvo. And I've taken up golf. Zen golf, of course."
   New Age entrepreneurs are also learning to profit from
growing mainstream acceptance of many values and interests
shared by the New Age movement, including environmental
awareness, nutrition, a variety of physical fitness
techniques and self-improvement, all underwritten by yuppie
affluence.
   "We've found a way to bring the value system of the New
Age into the marketplace," says Tom Chappell, president of
Tom's of Maine Inc., whose toothpaste, shampoo and other
personal-care products are challenging mass-market brands in
some East Coast stores.
   David Thorne, publisher of Boston-based New Age Journal,
says New Age companies are "stressing their environmental
sensibility, and this value-added approach actually helps
sell products. People are willing to pay more money because
they feel their values are aligned with the store."
   Mr. Thorne lists natural food grocery chains, such as
Bread &amp; Circus in the Boston area, and "socially responsible"
mutual funds, such as Calvert Social Investment Fund of
Washington, as being in the mainstream of the New Age
movement, which stresses social and environmental concerns as
well as personal growth and alternative life styles.
   Mr. deSabla's nine-year-old quarterly tabloid newspaper is
quintessential New Age. Its 80-plus pages serve as a sort of
New Age bulletin board for the nation's capitol, carrying
listings for massage therapists, acupuncturists, holistic
veterinarians, macrobiotic cooking classes and a travel agent
offering "metaphysical tours around the planet."
   But like many New Age survivors, Mr. deSabla's business is
firmly grounded in generally accepted accounting principles.
A self-described "child of the 60s" who previously worked as
an executive recruiter in California and as a benefits
negotiator for the National Education Association, he says he
aims his newspaper at readers and advertisers like himself:
"People who decided to hang up their pinstripe suits and live
alternatively."
   Mr. deSabla's New Age publishing formula is simple: Keep
advertising rates cheap; make the newspaper a resource guide
that's a must for advertisers because readers won't throw it
away; and use the paper to promote your other ventures.
   Pathways is free. Readers snatch up the 40,000-copy press
run in days. It's full of ads. Mr. deSabla doesn't have an ad
salesman.
   A full-page ad costs $600. Revenue from advertisers runs
about $35,000 an issue, which amply covers the $15,000
production costs. "I'd say 85% of our advertisers are on an
annual contract," Mr. deSabla says. "We do one mailing a year
and everything just comes back. We've never felt the need to
launch a big sales effort."
   New Age papers in a number of cities follow much the same
strategy. Among them: Common Ground in San Francisco, Thought
Trends in Atlanta, Free Spirit in New York and Catalyst in
Salt Lake City.
   To keep his desktop publishing system from gathering dust
between editions of Pathways, Mr. deSabla started a monthly
mainstream community newspaper in Takoma Park. Circulation
has hit 20,000. Once a year he stages a "Natural Living Expo"
at a local armory that, with little overhead, brings in
$20,000 from gate receipts and vendors. The show, a one-day
New Age bazaar, is heavily advertised in Pathways.
   He also runs weekend retreats on the East Coast, called
"Medicine Wheel Gatherings," where several hundred persons
pay $20 to sleep in a tent and listen to Native American
elders demonstrate tribal folkways.
   Others, such as Mr. Chappell, the toothpaste manufacturer
from Kennebunk, Maine, have found that their ideas are
gaining a broader following. The Tom's of Maine products have
extended their reach beyond health-food stores and into major
pharmacy and grocery chains with a marketing campaign that
promotes the products' natural ingredients and the company's
refusal to do testing on animals.
   The credo of the New Age customer, according to Mr.
Chappell: "Don't just give me a toothpaste that has colors
and tastes good, but one that also has human and
environmental dignity."
   Mr. Chappell's products sell for considerably more than
competing mass-market brands. Nevertheless, Tom's of Maine
sales should hit $11 million in the fiscal year ending this
June, Mr. Chappell says, up 35% from the previous year.
   "It doesn't take much market share before you change how
people think," he says. And, the entrepreneur adds: "The New
Age consciousness is firmly based. I'd say it's adaptable to
at least 25% of Americans."
