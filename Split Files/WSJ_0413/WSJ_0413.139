   Despite a 57% boost in fiscal first-quarter sales, ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif., reported a net loss
of $6.5 million, or 54 cents a share. A year ago, the company
reported net income of $2.9 million, or 19 cents a share.
   The company said it had an operating loss of $7.8 million,
due to unfavorable currency adjustments stemming from a weak
dollar, realized investment portfolio losses, increased
expenses due to its 1989 acquisition of Flow Laboratories,
and intensified marketing by pharmaceutical companies. A year
earlier, earnings from operations totaled $722,000.
