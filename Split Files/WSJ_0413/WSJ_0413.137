   TOKYO -- Officials of West European and Japanese official
development banks expect that Eastern Europe's economic
changes will lead to faster growth in Western economies, a
Dutch banking official said.
   He added that funding for Eastern European economic
changes wasn't expected to crowd out other economic
activities.

   M.J.L. Jonkhart, president of Da Nationale
Investeringsbank of the Netherlands, said Eastern European
political and economic changes were one of the main topics
discussed in a conference this week of Western European and
Japanese institutions specializing in long-term credit.
   Asked if funding of East European changes would crowd out
some other economic activities, he said, "I don't think so .
. . . The economic consequences are such that they have a
productive influence. They will in principle to a large
extent be self-financing."
