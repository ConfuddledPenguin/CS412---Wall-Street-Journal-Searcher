   A federal judge fined Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. $480,350 for
two counts of conspiring to trade on inside information and
securities fraud.
   The securities firm could have been fined $500,000 on each
count, but Judge Charles Haight Jr. said that imposing a
large fine on both counts would have been unfair because the
two convictions stem from one incident. In an unusual ruling,
the judge fined the firm $480,350 on each count, but said it
only has to pay the fine once. As a result, the fine will
stand even if one of the two convictions is overturned on
appeal.

   Federal prosecutors had urged the judge to order a
"substantial fine" but had not been more specific. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howard Heiss, one of the prosecutors on the
case, declined to comment on the size of the fine.
   Marcus Schloss, a trading firm on the New York Stock
Exchange, was convicted of the two counts in July in
connection with its purchases of stock in American Brands
Inc. in March 1986. The firm made illegal profits of $9,825.
Marcus Schloss has said it is appealing the conviction. The
firm was acquitted on securities fraud charges involving its
trading in three other stocks.
   That case marked the first time that a Big Board member
firm had ever been convicted of insider trading. A specialist
trading firm, such as Marcus Schloss, acts as a market maker
in certain stocks.
   In determining the sentence, Judge Haight said he took
into consideration a settlement Marcus Schloss reached with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 1988. In
that settlement, which involved trading in American Brands
and other stocks, the firm turned over alleged illegal
profits of $136,900 and paid civil penalties of $273,800.
   Of those SEC penalties, however, only $19,650 was directly
related to the American Brands trading. Judge Haight, in
federal court in Manhattan, said he deducted that amount from
the fine he considered appropriate for the criminal
conviction. At the sentencing, Marvin Schwartz, an attorney
for Marcus Schloss, said it would be "double hitting" for the
criminal fine not to take into account some of the civil
penalties paid to the SEC.
   Judge Haight said he believed the reduced fine would still
send a message to the securities industry. "Trading while in
possession of material, confidential, nonpublic information
is a crime. . . . It constitutes an affront to the fair
operation of the marketplace," the judge said.

   NEW JUDICIAL PROCEDURES may be needed in cases involving
secret documents, says the independent counsel in the
Iran-Contra investigations.
   Congress may have to set special procedures, with
curtailed individual rights, to avoid problems with
disclosing classified documents in cases such as the
Iran-Contra prosecutions, Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh
said.
   Mr. Walsh suggested in an interview that Congress may want
to restrict certain defendants' rights to a public trial or a
jury of ordinary citizens because of the reluctance of
intelligence agencies to surrender classified material. The
attorney general, acting on behalf of the intelligence
agencies, can unilaterally bar the disclosure of classified
documents.
   "The picture is not happy," said Mr. Walsh, whose office
recently won the conviction of former National Security
Adviser John Poindexter for coordinating the cover-up of
covert U.S. arms sales to Iran and secret White House support
for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. "The question you come
down to," Mr. Walsh said, is: "Do you have to go to some
special system of justice like the military has?" Military
courts have restrictions on defendants' rights not found in
the civilian judicial system.
   Mr. Walsh's suggestion isn't new. Jack Friedenthal, dean
of George Washington University's law school and an expert on
legal evidence, said that "restrictions (on rights at trial)
perhaps should be the cost of holding sensitive government
positions."
   Another alternative, Mr. Walsh said, is "forcing greater
flexibility on the (intelligence) agencies in dealing with
documents." Mr. Walsh has criticized the Bush administration
for being overly zealous in protecting documents deemed
secret by the Central Intelligence Agency. He was forced to
drop conspiracy and fraud charges against Mr. Poindexter and
other defendants because of the government's concern about
disclosing secret documents.
   The independent counsel said he will submit a report to
Congress on this and other matters at the conclusion of the
Iran-Contra investigation. Meanwhile, Mr. Walsh reiterated
that he may bring additional indictments later this year.
   He is expected to recommend that Mr. Poindexter be
sentenced to prison for coordinating the cover-up of the
Iran-Contra affair. The other convicted defendants have not
received prison terms.
   Mr. Poindexter was convicted on five felony counts,
including making false statements and obstructing
congressional inquiries.

   AIDS TEST MANUFACTURER drops lawsuit against government.
   University Hospital Laboratories Corp., manufacturer of a
controversial home kit that tests for infection of the AIDS
virus, settled its suit in federal court against the Health
and Human Services Department and the Food and Drug
Administration.
   Under the terms of the settlement, the FDA must decide
within 120 days whether to approve the company's kit. The
company's chairman, Elliot Millenson, a vocal critic of the
FDA approval process, said the settlement was tantamount to
approval. "The public health benefits are so compelling that
there's little doubt that the product would be rejected," he
said. The product would allow consumers to perform blood
tests on themselves and mail them anonymously to the company.
Results would be retrieved by calling a toll-free phone
number and giving an identification number.
   But FDA spokesman Brad Stone described the outcome as more
uncertain. "It's not a guarantee that we're going to approve
the product," he said. "What it does say is that we will
review it."
   Mr. Millenson first sought FDA approval in 1987 after
clinical trials. But the FDA withheld the application on the
ground that tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome
should be marketed only for use in a hospital or clinic.
   Under the terms of the settlement, FDA will reconsider
that decision.

   CO-OP AND CONDO DIRECTORS have broad authority to make
building policy, New York's highest court rules.
   The state's Court of Appeals ruled that cooperative and
condominium boards are shielded from judicial scrutiny by a
standard similar to the business judgment rule. The rule
prohibits judges from second-guessing actions taken by
corporate directors no matter what the result, as long as
their decisions were reasonable, legal and made in good
faith.
   "Application of a similar doctrine is appropriate because
a cooperative corporation is -- in fact and function -- a
corporation, acting through the management of its board of
directors, and subject to the Business Corporation Law," the
court wrote in a unanimous opinion. The court noted that New
Jersey, Washington and Colorado have adopted the same
standard.
   The case involved an action brought by tenant-shareholder
Ronald Levandusky challenging the board of One Fifth Avenue
Apartment Corp. in New York. At the board's request, a court
ordered Mr. Levandusky not to relocate a steam pipe in his
apartment. His attorney, Irwin Brownstein, said he had not
read the opinion and had no comment.
   One Fifth Avenue's attorney, Arthur Abelman, predicts that
the decision should diminish the amount of litigation brought
by tenant-shareholders challenging board decisions.

   COMPROMISE IS REACHED on SEC's efforts to join Drexel
creditors' committee.
   Attorneys for the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. creditors' committee
told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman that they have
agreed to resolve the matter on an interim basis. The interim
agreement will at least postpone a court fight over the SEC's
efforts to join the committee.
   Drexel filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
in February, and the SEC maintains it is the firm's largest
creditor because Drexel owes it $150 million as part of a
settlement last year of civil charges. The creditors'
committee and the U.S. Trustee's Office, a Justice Department
branch that administers bankruptcy proceedings, have opposed
the SEC's unprecedented request to be made a member of the
committee.
   Under the interim agreement, the SEC will be able to
consult with the committee's attorneys and with the
committee's chairman "to share information and ideas
regarding the conduct of the Chapter 11 case." The SEC will
also be notified of matters on which the committee plans to
make a formal decision -- except for issues involving the
internal functioning of the committee and anything relating
to actions that the committee may take against the SEC.
   In the event the agreement doesn't work out, a hearing on
the SEC's original motion is set for June 12.

   TWO BUSINESSMEN and their Connecticut companies plead
guilty to federal tax charges.
   Peter M. Brant, 43, of Greenwich, Conn. and Joseph Allen,
48, of Manhattan, and their companies, the Bato Co. and
Riviere Du Loup Newsprint Ltd., entered the pleas in federal
court in Bridgeport, Conn., and agreed to pay $2.4 million in
fines.
   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said Messrs. Brant and
Allen pleaded guilty to willful failure to maintain records
from which their taxable income and tax could be determined.
Bato and Riviere Du Loup pleaded guilty to two counts each of
making and subscribing false tax returns for two years. The
two men were accused of charging substantial personal
expenses to their companies, which then reported the expenses
as business deductions.
   Bato and Riviere agreed to pay maximum fines of $1 million
each and Messrs. Brant and Allen agreed to pay maximum fines
of $200,000 each. Mr. Brant will also pay $250,000 in taxes
due and a civil fraud penalty of $125,000.
   Neither Mr. Brant nor his attorney were available for
comment. Mr. Allen's attorney did not return phone calls.
