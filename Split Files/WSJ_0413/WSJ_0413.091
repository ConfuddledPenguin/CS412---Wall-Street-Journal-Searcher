   Several mall retailers reported better-than-expected sales
for March, given this year's late Easter holiday season.
   Analysts estimate sales at stores open at least a year
rose an average of 3% to 4%, or about the same rate as
inflation. But the analysts said the results suggest April's
showing will be much stronger because of Easter's shift into
April this year from late March. The analysts, who favor
combining the two months for comparison purposes, predict a
same-store increase averaging about 6% for the period.

   "The numbers show a great deal of underlying strength in
spending," said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc. "In the
beginning of February, most people thought consumer spending
was going to be quite sluggish."
   The March results also suggest that department stores and
mall specialty stores that sell apparel may be gaining market
share. "Malls are doing better than strip centers," said
Thomas Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. "All of the
price promotions and additional advertising in the fourth
quarter has clearly brought consumers back into the mall, and
they are staying there."
   Mr. Tashjian and other analysts noted that mall stores are
ringing up respectable sales gains now, without having to
slash prices as often as they did over the Christmas season.
"There appears to have been a decline in promotional
activity," said Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities.
   Because of a difference in their fiscal calendars, only
about half of the nation's big retailers reported March sales
yesterday. Gap Inc. led the pack with a 12% increase in
same-store sales. Limited Inc.'s same-store sales rose a more
modest 4%, disappointing some analysts.
   Last week, several big retailers, including Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co., Woolworth Corp. and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., reported
generally weaker results. Two exceptions were Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and J.C. Penney Co., where same-store sales rose 12% and
8.7% respectively.
   K mart Corp., a big discount chain, said sales at stores
open at least a year in the U.S. and Canada declined 1.1%. K
mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said "sales were strong in the
first two weeks of March," but "weakened in line with
expectations" because of the late Easter holiday.
   Same-store sales rose 8.2% at Dayton Hudson Corp., which
operates the Target and Mervyn's discount chains in addition
to its Dayton Hudson department store division. At May
Department Stores Inc., same-store sales rose 2.7%. Neiman
Marcus Group Inc.'s same-store sales rose 2.3%. And Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said its same-store sales declined
2.4%.
