   WAYLAND, Mass. -- Candela Laser Corp. said it is
considering redeeming its 8% convertible subordinated notes
with a total principal amount of $3,625,000.
   The notes are convertible into 375,148 shares of common

position.

   The maker of medical laser systems said the closing price
of its stock has exceeded the required threshold, enabling it
to call the notes at its option. Candela has 4.6 million
shares outstanding. It filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission covering the stock issuable upon conversion of the
notes.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Candela
Laser shares rose $1.125 to $14.875.
