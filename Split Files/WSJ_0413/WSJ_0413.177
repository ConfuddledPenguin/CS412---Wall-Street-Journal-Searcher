   Four retail and supermarket chains in Western states said
they will adopt strict standards for products making
environmental claims to address consumers' mounting concern
about misleading advertising.
   The retailers said they have designated an independent
consulting company to review product claims and award a
"Green Cross" seal of approval to products that promote
recycling and reduce waste and pollution.

   The chains sponsoring the program are Campeau Corp.'s
Ralphs Grocery Co., based in Compton, Calif., with 143 stores
in Southern California; Sacramento, Calif.-based Raley's,
with 58 stores in Northern California; Phoenix, Ariz.-based
Abco Markets Inc., with 75 stores in Arizona; and Portland,
Ore.-based Fred Meyer Inc., with 125 stores in seven Western
states.
   The retailers said they planned to announce the program at
a news conference scheduled for this morning in Washington.
   Kevin Davis, vice president of advertising for Ralphs,
said retailers are adopting the program because customers are
confused by conflicting advertising claims and are pressing
stores for guidance in choosing products that are truly
"environment friendly."
   "We are interested in making sure that claims are
authenticated before we support them with in-store
advertising," Mr. Davis said.
   However, some environmentalists expressed concern that
retailers were rushing to launch a national environmental
seal program as a marketing ploy riding on publicity
surrounding Earth Day.
   Lisa Collaton, staffer with Environmental Action
Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group, said she was
concerned that product standards adopted by the retailers
might not be valid or could conflict with efforts by other
agencies. She noted that Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes
plans to launch a similar national program known as Green
Seal next month, and that government-sponsored programs are
under consideration.
   "Our concern is that the retailers may be rushing this
program to get a marketing advantage," before a consensus has
been reached on definitions and standards for labeling green
products, Ms. Collaton said.
   Mr. Davis said retailers felt compelled to respond quickly
to consumers' concerns, but that Green Cross could be
modified later to conform to national standards that might be
developed. He said he expected other retail chains would join
the program and that products would be submitted for review
within 30 to 60 days.
   The four retailers have designated Scientific
Certification Systems Inc., of Oakland, Calif., to develop
standards, review products and issue a "Green Cross" seal. To
qualify for the seal, products would have to contain at least
50% recycled material, or other materials, such as wood or
cotton, that are considered "sustainable." The recycled
content would have to be from consumer waste, not plant
scrap.
   In addition, product and packaging manufacturers would
have to meet all federal, state and local environmental
regulations to get the seal. The manufacturers would also
have to nearly eliminate plant emissions of any substances
known to cause cancer or reproductive damage.
   Products making advertising claims would be encouraged to
submit those for review by Scientific Certification, Mr.
Davis said. Stores would promote products whose claims have
been verified, he said.
   Manufacturers would pay fees to Scientific Certification
to have their products, labeling and production facilities
reviewed for compliance with Green Cross standards. Linda
Brown, a vice president of Scientific Certification, said the
company is employee-owned and has no financial ties to
retailers or manufacturers. A division of the company,
Nutriclean, certifies to retailers that produce meets FDA
standards for pesticide residues, is organic or meets other
advertising claims.
   Craig Merrilees, of the National Toxics Campaign Fund, a
Boston-based environmental advocacy group, said the standards
proposed by the retailers would be tougher than any existing
labeling programs used by manufacturers or retailers, such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the U.S. and Loblaws Supermarkets
Ltd. in Canada. He said his group helped in developing tough
standards that could lead to "significant changes" in product
design and manufacturing.
   "This is not going to be an easy test for products to
pass," Mr. Merrilees said.
   Cheryl Perrin, vice president of public affairs for Fred
Meyer stores, said: "We must provide an incentive for
manufacturers to integrate recycled materials into their
products whenever possible." Julie Weeks, quality assurance
manager for Ralphs, said the retailer wants to "communicate
our customers' concerns back to the manufacturers."
