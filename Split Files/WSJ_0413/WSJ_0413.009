   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. agreed to sell its
mutual fund custodial business to Investors Bank &amp; Trust Co.,
a 77.3% owned unit of Eaton Vance Corp. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The transaction is part of the troubled bank's efforts to
reduce its asset-size and raise cash to meet federal capital
regulatory standards.

   The transaction would substantially boost the size of
custodial operations at Investors Bank, which had $7 billion
under custody prior to the agreement. The Bank of New England
operations to be sold have $22 billion in mutual fund assets
under custody.
