   NEW YORK -- The man who made "Cats" sing is lining up a
chorus of investors for more than one show.
   Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer of hit musicals "Evita,"
"Cats" and "The Phantom of the Opera," among others, is
attempting to raise as much as $20 million in a private
placement offering to wealthy individuals. The offering is
the largest of its kind in the theater and the first offering
for more than one play. If successful, it may open up a new
source of money in the increasingly expensive and risky
business of live theater.

   Mr. Webber's extravagant productions have made lots of
money for investors, but this offering warns of substantial
risks. Still, Mr. Webber and his advisers are betting that
the composer's impressive record in producing mainstream hits
will attract investors willing to buy units of $50,000 each,
even though they won't know ahead of time every production on
which the money will be spent.
   In a prospectus being circulated by Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. and Mutual Benefit Financial Service Co., a
unit of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., investors are
offered the chance to put their money into "financing the
production of musical and dramatic plays." According to the
offering document, about three-quarters of the money will be
used for Mr. Webber's plays, both on Broadway and for touring
productions around the world. But about $4 million or so will
go for a "blind" fund, producing non-Webber musicals and
plays chosen by Mr. Webber's London-based Really Useful Group
Inc.
   The securities firms, lawyers and consultants on the
offering are tight-lipped about details. But theater experts
say the Webber offering is being closely watched in the
industry. "If this offering works, it opens the possibility
of a lot of people doing something like it," says Paul
Woerner, an entertainment attorney with Leavy, Rosenweig &amp;
Hyman. "It took someone who was willing to assume the
enormous risk and expense of putting together an offering: If
this goes, their offering literature will become the form
everybody uses."
   Although limited partnerships to raise money for movies
became popular in the '80s, Broadway producers had a hard
time getting similar concepts through the New York attorney
general's office. Finally, after several years of lobbying
and work sessions between attorneys and producers, the rules
were changed in November 1988 to allow theatrical offerings
for more than one play. But the Webber offering is the first
to take advantage of the change.
   "I'm surprised it took this long," says Elizabeth Block,
the assistant attorney general who specializes in theatrical
financing. She adds that "the theater industry made it clear
all along that this wouldn't necessarily be a common thing,
and they wanted the first one out of the box to be a good one
for investors. They didn't want the industry to get a bad
name." Ms. Block says that until now, the biggest investment
fund that she has approved for a single show was about $8
million for the flop musical "Carrie."
   It isn't clear that the Webber fund will be a winner for
investors. The offering documents say that about $4.2 million
will go toward a U.S. road show of "Phantom of the Opera,"
with another $1 million going to the French production of the
smash hit. But investors won't get any money from the
continuing Broadway and London productions, and Mr. Webber
now plans a movie of the play that may reduce appetites for
theater tickets.
   More than $6 million of the $20 million maximum is to be
spent on the Broadway production of Mr. Webber's newest
musical, "Aspects of Love," and $1.3 million is going to the
Canadian version of that show. But the just-opened Broadway
show received some of the most negative reviews of Mr.
Webber's career, with some critics even suggesting that it
may snap the composer's winning streak. Although the offering
document says the show opened with more than $10 million in
advance Broadway ticket sales, it isn't clear yet that this
show will be a long-running megahit like "Cats" and
"Phantom."
   Although the document doesn't disclose revenues for any
shows or project future revenues, it does say that "Aspects"
would have to run for a minimum of 74 1/2 weeks to a capacity
house before investors could start making a profit. As the
document points out, few plays ran that long in the 1988-1989
season, and "few {of those that did} played to capacity
audiences."
   Perhaps the biggest gamble for investors involves Mr.
Webber's future plans. The composer has announced his
intentions to stop writing musicals for the foreseeable
future and turn his efforts to making movies. That's why,
according to Mr. Webber, he's buying back the public stock in
Really Useful Group, which has jumped in value as profits
from "Cats" have continued to roll in. "The profits from past
shows will fall over time, and he doesn't want to have to
write more musicals just to puff up the profits of Really
Useful," says Robert Kretowicz, a financial adviser to Mr.
Webber at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London.
   That means that the "blind" portion of the new theater
fund will go into non-Webber shows selected by Really Useful,
and the offering documents show that only one out of seven
non-Webber shows so far produced by Really Useful has made
money for investors. Several are still running.
   Nevertheless, many Broadway veterans are delighted that at
least an attempt is being made to bring a new source of
funding to the theater.
   "I think this is great," says Miles Wilkin, chairman of
Pace Theatrical Group, which mostly puts on touring
productions of Broadway shows. "People view investing in
Broadway as a major crapshoot and anything that upgrades
investment in theater as legitimate business is very
positive. For us, most shows outside New York make a modest
or better profit. and I've often thought that a blind pool
could be put together that would combine a New York premiere
with some less risky touring productions," Mr. Wilkin says.
   Less optimistic observers point out that few producers and
playwrights have Mr. Webber's track record, making it much
harder to float such a fund. Veteran producer Arthur Cantor,
who is trying to save money these days by putting on one-man
shows, says that if Broadway figures such as choreographer
Jerome Robbins and playwright Neil Simon wanted to raise
funds in a blind pool, "investors would jump right in." But
"it's a short list."
   "The cost of doing plays is too high," argues producer
Emanual Azenberg. "This won't change that, or make better
plays. Besides, plays are not like movies: There aren't as
many ways to make money on a flop," he adds.
   Some argue that theater pools may take out too much of the
fun for investors. Entertainment lawyer Elliot Brown says: "I
have put a lot of investors in a lot of shows, and they do it
because they love a particular project and they love going to
opening night and hanging out in the theater. This sort of
turns theater into a flinty-eyed investment, and that may
take the romance out for some people."
