   With technology and financial stocks leading the way, the
over-the-counter market ended the holiday week higher, but
not yet fully recovered, analysts cautioned.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 2.78 at 436.31, for a
0.06% gain. Advancing stocks outpaced decliners by the week's
largest margin, 1,068 to 797, as volume rose to 141,412,600
shares from 133,820,400. There were 118 new highs and 87 new
lows set for the day.

   The high flier for the day was Northeast Bancorp, which
soared 8 to close at 40 1/2 on reports the Stamford, Conn.,
bank is negotiating the book value on which its planned
merger with Bank of New York is based. There had been doubts
the merger would go through.
   Robert C. King, senior vice president of OTC trading for
Robinson Humphrey Co. of Atlanta, says the week was marked by
a rebound in some of the battered regional bank stocks, with
Bank South up 1/2 at 10 1/8, Colorado National, up 1/8 at 14
5/8 and Midlantic Corp. of New Jersey holding steady at 16
1/2. The Nasdaq Financial 100 Index, which includes the
market's largest regional bank stocks, rose 3.41, to 387.25.
   Technology stocks gained early in the day as Intel pleased
Wall Street with earnings on the high end of expectations,
but ended off slightly on profit-taking. Intel joined other
technology stocks such as Microsoft and Sequent in testing
yearly highs in morning trading, before closing off for the
day as investors left the market early for the long Easter
weekend.
   Intel closed off 1/4 at 42 1/2, Microsoft was off 1/4 at
120 3/4 and Sequent fell 1/4 to 26 1/4. Also trading heavily
was Apple Computer, up 3/4 to 43 1/4.
   The Nasdaq 100 index, which tracks the market's largest
technology stocks, gained 0.7% yesterday and 1.7% for the
week, beating the composite index.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton technology analyst Paul Johnson
says he thinks the annual peaks of high-quality companies
such as Intel and Apple will be tested as their earnings
encourage investors. Intel reported higher-than-expected
first-quarter earnings of 73 cents a share, up from 52 cents
a share a year earlier. Apple is expect to report quarter
earnings next week.
   But Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak calls the recent
strength in the technology sector "very tenuous." The
economy, he says, is too sluggish to support strong growth in
all but the strongest companies that are enjoying "boomlets"
in demand for their products, such as Intel's 32-byte
products.
   Preston Athey, manager of T. Rowe Price's emerging-growth
stocks fund, says he hasn't forgotten the few "torpedoes"
that recently shook the sector: the earnings disappointments
of Oracle, Legent and the Big Board's Network Equipment
Technologies.
   "The technology sector can be a graveyard for aggressive
managers who get too far out on a limb," Mr. Athey says.
   Candela Laser ended up 1 1/8 to 14 7/8. The company filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the issue of
stock related to the potential conversion of subordinated
notes.
   The laser maker says it hasn't decided whether it will
call the $3,625,000 principal amount of 8% convertible notes,
but a decision is expected in a week. The company is also
expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on April 26.
   Iomega fell 7/8, to 4 1/4, on heavy volume after the maker
of computer disk drives reported net income of $2.5 million,
or 15 cents a share, on sales of $29.1 million, compared with
net the year ago quarter of $1.6 million, or nine cents a
share, on sales of $24.8 million.
   In other areas, Pic 'N' Save was among the day's most
active stocks closing up 5/8 at 14 1/8 with more than eight
times average volume changing hands. Late Wednesday, a
partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder, a former
strategist for T. Boone Pickens and an adviser to Marvin
Davis, disclosed that it holds a 6.6% stake in the company
and plans to make a bid for the retail-discount chain. The
company's shares traded actively last week on speculation
about Mr. Batchelder's interest.
   Improved earnings lifted U.S. Bancorp's shares 1 1/8, to
28 3/4. The bank reported first-quarter net income of 85
cents a share, up nearly 20% from year-earlier income of 71
cents a share. Shares of the Portland, Ore., company rose 1
1/4Wednesday on heavy volume.
   Burnup &amp; Sims added 5/8 to close at 15 5/8 after
announcing its shareholders would receive both a stock
dividend in a new telecommunications company, and shares
representing closely held National Beverage Corp., which will
become a publicly owned company.
   Shares of J. Baker continued to tumble in heavy trading
following Ames Department Stores' announcement earlier this
week that it plans to close 74 of its 680 stores. The
footware retailer is an Ames supplier. J. Baker closed off 1
3/4, or 13%, at 12 1/8.
