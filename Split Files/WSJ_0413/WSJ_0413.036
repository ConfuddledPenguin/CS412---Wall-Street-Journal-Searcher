   MANAMA, Bahrain -- Saudi Arabia has opened its fledgling
domestic bond market to offshore banks in the Persian Gulf in
a new move to increase trading, bankers said.
   The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (Sama), the kingdom's
central bank, has told domestic banks that it will permit
trading in its so-called "development bonds" in offshore
centers such as Bahrain and Dubai.

   Previously the secondary market in the government bonds
had been restricted to domestic banks.
   "It's a fairly major concession," one Saudi banker said.
"Any major financial institution with an outlet in Bahrain
and Dubai will now be able to trade the bonds," he added.
   Bankers said the concession reflects Sama's determination
to make a success of the bond program, which has been used
since 1988 to finance the kingdom's substantial annual budget
deficits.
   Saudi Arabia began considering changes in the program last
year after the kingdom's banks showed increased reluctance to
take up all the fortnightly issues.
   For the moment, dealing will be open only to banks with a
branch presence in one of the Gulf Co-operation Council
states, or overseas banks that have a Saudi shareholding.
However, bankers said they believe the change is only a first
step towards the full internationalization of the bond
program.
   Bankers say the bond program will likely appeal to
offshore banks already active in the Saudi riyal deposit or
currency markets and to the major Gulf institutions such as
Arab Banking Corp., Gulf International Bank and National Bank
of Abu Dhabi. However, they say it may be some time before
the offshore banks get heavily involved in Saudi bond
dealings.
   Earlier this year six Saudi banks started acting as market
makers in the bonds, quoting continuous prices on
screen-based communications systems during banking hours.
Domestic Saudi banks are being encouraged to market the bonds
to state companies and private citizens.
   Saudi Arabia plans to issue 25 billion riyals ($6.6
billion) of bonds in 1990 to finance this year's expected
budget deficit. The kingdom has run substantial deficits in
every year since 1983, but the bond program wasn't introduced
until 1988 when it became clear that Saudi Arabia needed an
alternative to drawing on its foreign reserves to finance the
deficits.
   Diplomats estimate that the kingdom has issued about 80
billion riyals of bonds since the program began.
   Officially the bonds pay a return linked to the profit on
various development projects in Saudi Arabia, thus overcoming
the Islamic prohibition on interest payments. In practice,
however, the bonds have a fixed spread over equivalent U.S.
Treasury instruments.
