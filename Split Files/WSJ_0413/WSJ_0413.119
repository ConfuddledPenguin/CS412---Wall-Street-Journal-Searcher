   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau admitted that returns from
the 1990 census are lagging badly, in part, because Americans
are treating the forms like another piece of junk mail.
   Nearly two weeks after the April 1 target day, the bureau
said only 57% of the 103 million households that were mailed
census forms have returned them. The bureau is hoping for a
minimum 70% return rate by mail. It plans to count the
remaining households in a massive, and costly, household
canvass this spring and summer.

   Census Director Barbara Bryant said each 1% of the return
rate that falls below the 70% goal will cost taxpayers an
extra $10 million. The money will be spent to hire and pay
extra door-to-door enumerators. At the same time, census
officials concede that tens of thousands of Americans haven't
received their 1990 population forms due partly to erroneous
mailing lists.
   Census officials were prepared for a poor response rate
from low-income neighborhoods and areas with high immigrant
populations. But Ms. Bryant expressed surprise at the number
of affluent households ignoring their forms.
   "We understand that over the last 10 years, the American
people have been bombarded by direct and junk mail," Ms.
Bryant said. She called the census form "one piece of mail
that counts."
   Population totals from the decennial census are used to
allocate seats in the House of Representatives and state
legislatures. They are also the benchmark for handing out
billions of dollars in government grants.
