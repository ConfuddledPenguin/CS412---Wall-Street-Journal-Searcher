   HOUSTON -- Wainoco Oil Corp., an oil and gas exploration
and production company, said it agreed to buy all the U.S.
oil and gas properties of Tredegar Industries Inc. of
Richmond, Va., a diversified maker of plastics and aluminum,
for $16.5 million in a transaction to be completed by July.
   Tredegar said it expects to incur an after-tax loss of
about $4 million, or 35 cents a share, on the sale. The
properties are in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas,
and Wainoco said they hold net proved reserves of about 1.6
million barrels of oil and 6.9 billion cubic feet of natural
gas, 97% of which are developed. Wainoco said the purchase
will increase its U.S. oil production by 93% and its U.S. gas
production by 46%.
