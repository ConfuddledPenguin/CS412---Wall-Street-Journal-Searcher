   Somebody in San Francisco ought to give Mikhail Gorbachev
a videocassette of "The Music Man" to watch on the flight
home. He'd get a big kick out of Professor Harold Hill, a man
of dynamism and charisma.
   Professor Harold Hill, you recall, showed up in River City
with a winning smile, a twinkle in his eye, and the promise
of perestroika in his satchel. "My friends you've got
trouble, right here in River City, with a capital T]"
Corruption will be rooted out. "A pool hall is the devil's
playground." As salvation, Professor Hill plans to give River
City a boys' band -- "not just any old band, but a boys'
band" -- with 76 trombones, 110 cornets and big bassoons.

   All that the people of River City have to do is sacrifice:
Pay handsome Harold Hill dearly for all these shiny brass
instruments, which will soon arrive by train from some
faraway place. Marian the Librarian was the town's wisest
person, and at first she resisted Professor Hill's
blandishments. But by the time the cold tide of reality began
to turn against the complex con man, she became his biggest
defender. They had developed good personal chemistry.
   The people of River City, as well other American citizens,
have just been offered a trade bill (with most-favored nation
status tossed in as a possible bonus), an unverifiable
chemical arms agreement, a promise to agree on a cut in
strategic arms and so on. But Professor Gorbachev has yielded
nothing on Germany, on Lithuania, and has offered only a
promise to buy American grain he most likely will badly need.
Mr. Gorbachev in his press conference yesterday morning said
he discovered this weekend that he can do business with Mr.
Bush. He'd like Marian too.
   We don't doubt that purely at the level of domestic U.S.
politics, Mr. Bush probably made gains in terms of public
popularity. There even may be something to be said for Mr.
Bush's disposition to let the role of bad cop fall to
Congress; it is, we suppose, one way of building consensus.
Much of the game remains to be played, and Mr. Bush is a
notably patient man. Still, the evolution of the Soviet Union
is at a crucial juncture, and it's disconcerting to see Mr.
Bush boosting Mikhail Gorbachev's baloney.
   A great deal is being swept under the rug of
Bush-Gorbachev "chemistry." While President Bush did
carefully restate the historic U.S. policy of not recognizing
incorporation of the Baltic nations into the Soviet Union, he
gave Mr. Gorbachev his trade agreement despite his trade
blockade of Lithuania. There is no way to verify the chemical
arms treaty, and "framework" agreements are intrinsically bad
negotiating.
   The more serious problem is that "chemistry" wraps U.S.
policy around one man, not around a set of principles or
objectives in U.S. Soviet relations. In fact, Mr. Gorbachev
has been running a balancing act between Soviet hardliners
and the reform forces he helped set loose. Lately the
reformers have been gaining, and Mr. Gorbachev has had to
boost the hardliners. For every Yeltsin or Lithuania that
appears, Mr. Gorbachev feels compelled to appoint a Pamyat
leader to his personal counsel or send us a gaggle of
anti-Semites who have demonstrated no ability to win popular
elections in their own country.
   It is getting way past time for the West's leaders to look
past Mr. Gorbachev's surface political sheen and recognize
that he is no longer producing forward movement. Instead, Mr.
Gorbachev is sounding more than ever like a traditional
Soviet politician. On Sunday, his rambling answers on German
reunification, Lithuanian independence and the emigration of
Soviet Jews were laden with caveats and threats ("what about
Vienna?"; "Israel should heed"; the Lithuanians are
besmirching his constitution). It all recalls the glacial
time-frame of a Leonid Brezhnev. History, however, is on a
tighter schedule.
   While Mr. Gorbachev demands more time at home for his
"radical" economic reforms (doing the right thing would
obviously destabilize the Communist Party, his only political
constituency), the nation is being driven to civil
insurrection by the predictable failure of those reforms.
Soon, events are probably going to force people such as
George Bush to choose between Mr. Gorbachev and the
democratic, free-market radicals who have been winning
elections.
   At the end of "The Music Man," the local population has
become discontented and increasingly furious at the
realization that Professor Hill won't be able to deliver on
his promise of a boys' band. The most radical among them want
to tar and feather him. Panicked, the endlessly resourceful
Professor Hill gathers the boys together and in one lesson
teaches them to play broomsticks, shovels, and pots and pans.
As they march into the street, Professor Hill tosses his
baton into the air, the camera frames it against the sky, and
it descends to display a boys' band in dazzling marching-band
uniforms, playing a rousing version of "76 Trombones."
Another happy ending.
   Professor Gorbachev hopes to assemble his own pick-up band
from various elements: the tatters of the Soviet economy, the
wish for a "regulated market economy," the nationalities
restive under Soviet rule, the enormous cost of his bloated
military machine and support of places like Cuba, and the
ambitions of the best of the Russian people to join the
world. We doubt that chemistry with George Bush is likely to
provide him a Hollywood ending.
