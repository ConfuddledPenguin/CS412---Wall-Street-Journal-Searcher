   MACON, Ga. -- Charter Medical Corp., as part of an effort
to trim costs, said it will close about 25 outpatient
counseling centers and idle about 600 employees across the
country.
   Charter, a psychiatric-care company, went private in a
1988 buy-out and recently encountered problems in its fiscal
second quarter, ended March 31, when it posted a $67 million
loss on revenue of $475.2 million. The year earlier, Charter
had a $14.6 million loss on revenue of $397.3 million.

   The most recent figures, which included a $35 million
pretax charge for accounting problems, raised some concerns
on Wall Street about the company's ability to service its
debt. At the time, Charter said it would cut capital
expenditures and other costs to ensure its ability to meet
its payments.
   The company's executive vice president for human resources
and development, Rod Laughlin, said yesterday that the
current closings and terminations reflect efforts to cut
costs as well as seasonal layoffs in the hospital business.
Patient loads, he said, typically lighten in the early
summer.
   Charter has between 250 and 300 counseling centers across
the country, Mr. Laughlin said, and a total of about 20,000
employees. The layoffs, he said, some of which will come
through attrition, involve primarily administrative positions
as opposed to those involved directly in medical care. All
the moves are expected to be completed in the current
quarter, he said.
   Mr. Laughlin said the company doesn't expect to make any
further closings or dismissals.
