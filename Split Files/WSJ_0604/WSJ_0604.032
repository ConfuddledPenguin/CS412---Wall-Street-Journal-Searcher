   A few years ago, while doing a story about the spate of
books by and about Mikhail Gorbachev, I phoned the American
publisher of one of these perestroika potboilers. What I
wanted to ask him was: Why did all the photos in his book
show the General Secretary, as he then was known, without the
famous Gorbachevian splotch? In every illustration, the
carapace gleamed unblemished as a baby's bottom.
   The publisher at first denied that this was so but finally
admitted that the photos, which he had obtained from a Soviet
news service, did indeed appear airbrushed. I told him it
seemed a curious thing, in this age of glasnost. Didn't it?
The publisher quickly lost patience and snapped: "Are you
trying to tell me Reagan doesn't dye his hair?"

   That swift leap into irrelevance is typical of the Soviet
apologist, or, in the publisher's case, of anyone who wants
to squeeze a buck out of Americans' interest in Soviet
affairs. Vladimir Pozner, whose memoir, "Parting With
Illusions" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 324 pages, $19.95), rides
the best-seller lists these days, is an unwholesome blend of
both: a Soviet apologist intent on making a buck. And the
swift leap into irrelevance is his favored polemical dodge.
   Mr. Pozner, of course, is something of a celebrity in the
U.S., the first Russian under 350 lbs. allowed by Soviet
authorities to appear regularly on U.S. television. He has
faced his daunting mandate -- to convince the American people
of communism's essential docility -- with admirable poise:
His background perfectly suits him to selling the unsalable
to a people who will buy almost anything.
   Young Vlad was raised in Manhattan by a Russian father and
French mother, who later repatriated with their teen-age son
to Moscow. There Mr. Pozner worked as a Soviet journalist,
filing reports of happy Ukrainian milkmaids and handsome
Lithuanian conscripts for Soviet Life, a glossy propaganda
sheet marketed exclusively in the West. Later, in the early
'70s, Radio Moscow asked him to broadcast a daily talk to
America called, with typical Soviet elegance, "Vladimir
Pozner's Daily Talk."
   When American television discovered him in the dicey early
Reagan years, he was ready. Phil Donahue, Ted Koppel and
others quickly embraced him, for despite his somewhat oily
looks he spoke American English better than most Americans
and was even, on occasion, moved to admit the unwisdom of a
few notorious Soviet boo-boos -- the Stalinist purges, for
example, and the hyperactive collectivization of agriculture.
Faced with boners of more recent vintage, such as the downing
of KAL 007, Mr. Pozner clung to the Motherland; but by the
(shall we say?) less-than-hardnosed standard of network news
departments, he was a revelation, a goldmine of good copy.
   Alas, that gift fails him in his memoir. He admits in
"Parting With Illusions" that he didn't want to write a
memoir at all -- and sure enough, he hasn't. A floss of
narrative passes from chapter to chapter, adorned with the
obligatory maudlin confessions ("There have been times of
intense pain, of loneliness, of insecurity . . . "); the
crackerbarrel chin-pulling ("Isn't it amazing that death
shocks us? Birth doesn't yet death is as natural as birth");
and the lame humor (I'll spare you) familiar to readers of
the celebrity memoir.
   But the book differs from, say, the late Sammy Davis Jr.'s
"Yes I Can" in that its bulk is given over to communist
apologetics, of the sort that never fails to floor Phil
Donahue when Vlad appears on his show. Only here they last
much longer. (One puts down the book with renewed affection
for the soundbite.) Again, the quick change of subject, the
sudden leap, is his metier. Certain facts of Soviet history
-- such as its unmitigated moral horror -- are hard to avoid,
so Mr. Pozner gives a nod in their direction and then quickly
goes on the offensive.
   Sure, says Mr. Pozner, Stalin killed millions, but what
about the Hollywood Ten? Yes, there has been some censorship;
but what about those high-school libraries that ban "Catcher
in the Rye"? Andrei Vishinsky? A lot like Mitchell Palmer,
no? You think the KGB goes overboard? Tell it to the CIA] And
so on.
   This is pretty sordid stuff, but I suspect it works on a
certain kind of weak-minded American -- Larry King is a big
Pozner fan. And to be fair, the book affords a few small
pleasures. Only the most hardhearted reader could fail to
feel a frisson of delight when Mr. Pozner writes, "By 1947, I
was getting beaten up at Stuyvesant High for being
pro-Soviet." And there are moments when his vaunted command
of the American idiom fails him, as when he refers to some
capitalist as "Mr. Rich Bitch."
   But these are not enough to redeem what is -- not to put
too fine a point on it -- a squalid little slab of pulp. A
best-selling squalid little slab of pulp, to be sure, but
even Vlad admits that "my popularity in the United States
came as a great surprise to me." As we say in the USA, join
the club.
