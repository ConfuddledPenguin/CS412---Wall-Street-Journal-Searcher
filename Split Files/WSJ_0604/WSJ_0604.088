   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission last Friday
sent 500,000 European currency units ($607,150) in emergency
aid to refugees in the Soviet republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan. The aid was to be handled by the Belgian branch
of a French medical charity, Doctors Without Borders.
   The money will provide medical aid to about 30,000
Armenians who fled to Armenia from Azerbaijan following civil
unrest there last January, and to 15,000 Azerbaijanis who
left Armenia for Azerbaijan.
