   NEW YORK -- Economists are pruning second-quarter gross
national product forecasts, in light of flat May payrolls.
   Data jockeys are particularly concerned about slowing in
the service sector, which so far has managed to buoy the
economy, while manufacturing, construction and business
spending flagged. The outlook for GNP, or the value of the
total output of the nation's goods and services, wasn't very
hearty before the jobs report appeared: The consensus called
for annual growth of about 2% in the current quarter. MMS
International Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said it
lowered its own GNP estimate to 1.8% from 2.3%, in the wake
of last Friday's weaker-than-expected employment numbers.

   "The economy looks increasingly unbalanced," Donald
Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said.
"Trade's the only thing holding it up." Mr. Straszheim had
been predicting an annual growth rate of 2.7% for
second-quarter GNP. "That looks too high {now}. We'll have to
mark it down," he said, declining to pinpoint the markdown
yet. "It's going to be more than a haircut, but {GNP} will
still be a positive number." He is sticking to his
weak-but-no-recession outlook, but noted that some other
economists may cross over into the negative-GNP range this
quarter, on the basis of recent soft data. Economists in the
positive camp said that, in addition to decent export levels,
consumer spending appears to be besting its first-quarter
average, at least so far this period.
   But David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
Ltd., New York, questioned whether softness in May service
jobs presages softness in consumer spending. "Consumers may
be cutting back on discretionary services," he said. "If they
stop spending, the economy is in deep trouble."
   Analysts get little help in foretelling spending patterns
from this week's thin calendar: May auto sales and April
consumer credit. Car sales are believed to have been weak
again, and consumer credit is expected to have increased by
about $2.3 billion, following March's $2.6 billion gain.
   Through April at least, consumers were besting the average
they spent in the first quarter, Nomura's Mr. Resler said.
But he added, "Consumer spending and trade hold the key for
keeping the economy out of recession." Mr. Resler, who had
been predicting a 2% growth rate for GNP in the current
quarter, said he "will notch it down, maybe a half a
percentage point or so."
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. economist Stephen S. Roach also
lowered his GNP outlook, in the wake of May's employment
data. "Real GNP growth in the current quarter now seems
likely to be closer to the 1.5% to 2% range, rather than the
3% figure we had been carrying," he said in his weekly
newsletter.
   "Trends in the service sector are particularly
disturbing," Mr. Roach said. He noted that that during the
first five months of this year, job growth in private,
service-producing industries has averaged only 118,000 --
about 25% below the average pace for the second half of last
year. Economists noted that while the jobs report was soft,
they expect slightly higher May industrial production,
largely owing to overtime worked in the auto industry.
   The weaker employment data last Friday all but swamped any
positive reaction to a stronger report from the nation's
purchasers. In fact, Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch found
something most discouraging in the purchasing managers'
report: lower inventories in May. The decline may indicate
that manufacturers are operating with tighter and tighter
inventory these days, through better control methods. If so,
the building-for-inventory boost that many economists expect
to help second-quarter GNP isn't realistic.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said the
May inventories index fell "significantly" to its lowest
level since January 1983.
