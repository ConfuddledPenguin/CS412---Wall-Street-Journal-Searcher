   Is Dogged by Crises in Soviet Union

   ST. PAUL, Minn. -- He alighted from his Ilyushin 62 jet to
the strains of "Stars and Stripes Forever." He gestured bulky
cameramen out of his way to greet a mob of Americans,
including protesters. He charmed politicians, artists and
industrial leaders over corn cakes, Canadian walleye and
Wisconsin veal.
   Though Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev luxuriates in
his image as the pathfinder of perestroika, his trip here
yesterday to the soggy Midwestern plains and today to the
Pacific Coast and California's Silicon Valley fits
comfortably into a traditional political and diplomatic
pattern. He is only the latest in a long string of
politicians to seek political support at home through the
cheers of crowds abroad.

   And so when Mr. Gorbachev strode across fortuitously named
Summit Avenue into the governor's mansion, tooled through the
streets of the Twin Cities, and met with Midwestern farm and
business leaders in a gleaming, modern hotel, he was
following a path established when Peter the Great first
traveled West nearly three centuries ago.
   But like Peter the Great's voyages, Mr. Gorbachev's trip
is a working vacation from his troubles, with reminders every
time he passed a St. Paul supermarket -- boneless sirloins,
ready for the grill, are on sale for $2.99 a pound at
Knowlan's Market here this week -- of the food,
manufacturing, political and cultural crises that await him
when he returns tomorrow. Last week alone, he faced a
challenge from his rival Boris Yeltsin, the new president of
the Russian republic, and the threat that several regions
would refuse to send food to Moscow.
   The result is that, for all his public triumphs
barnstorming the U.S. this week, there were hints here in
Minnesota that Mr. Gorbachev is under siege in Moscow.
   "The act is getting a little bit old this time," says
Michael Sheehan, who does speech coaching and provides poise
instruction for Democratic politicians. "It's like going to a
Broadway show with the first replacement cast: It's still
being done very well, but it doesn't have the surprise and
freshness it did the first time."
   It did have bluntness, however. Mr. Gorbachev complained
about his own "military-industrial complex" and, almost
sheepishly, asked for U.S. investment, telling American
businessmen, "You won't lose your money in the Soviet Union."
The Soviet leader admitted to a roomful of committed
capitalists that "our old system became weak," adding that
"there has been some damage done to our economy."
   Mr. Gorbachev's itinerary underlined his struggles. Peter
the Great traveled West in 1697 to learn shipbuilding -- he
actually helped lay the hull of a ship -- to help imperial
Russia build a navy and boost its flagging war against the
Turks in the Crimea. Mr. Gorbachev traveled West to learn
about computers and corn yields to help boost his country's
economic base as it creates the foundation of a more
market-oriented society.
   But unlike Peter the Great, who traveled incognito, Mr.
Gorbachev and his handlers choreographed every step, even
going so far as to build in room for the spontaneity that has
become his trademark. When he abandoned his motorcade and
took to the streets outside the black iron spikes of the
governor's mansion, he defused the anger of Baltic
demonstrators who were calling for the freedom of Lithuania.
One of the protest leaders pronounced herself "excited" by
Mr. Gorbachev's gesture.
   Not least among his entourage was Oleg Uralov, who holds
the remarkable title of deputy minister of cinematography of
the U.S.S.R. and also is the chief executive officer of a
Soviet firm called Videofilm.
   "The primary goal here is to portray Gorbachev as a man,
as a human being," says Mr. Uralov, whose language is studded
with the cheerful catechism of perestroika. "Landscapes were
not the decisive factor in the intinerary."
   But the Gorbachev visit was far from that innocent. It
wasn't a coincidence, for example, that Mr. Gorbachev's aides
specifically requested that Raisa Gorbachev visit a family
with four children, a dog and working parents. Thus did
Steven and Karen Watson and their home at 4841 Garfield Ave.,
South Minneapolis, gain their shimmery moment in the
spotlight.
   The Soviets know, moreover, that the most enduring moments
of Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the U.S. in 1959 were the
glimpse of the general secretary munching a hot dog and the
sight of him picking up silage (and smelling it) on Roswell
Garst's farm in Coon Rapids, Iowa.
   "Gorbachev's people are as concerned about the `visuals'
as American advance people," says David Van Note of North
Conway, N.H., who was pressed into service here because of
his work in the Democratic presidential candidacies of John
Glenn in 1984 and Bruce Babbitt in 1988. "They know the
pictures have to convey the theme Gorbachev wants to convey
at home. He wanted the business meeting to look like a
business meeting. We're not talking about people who don't
know the value of media coverage to convey an idea."
   That doesn't mean that the campaign-style trip Mr.
Gorbachev is completing today will play in the Politburo or
even in Pinsk.
   National leaders who seek political boosts outside their
borders seldom win more than temporary blips in their
support. When Benjamin Disraeli -- his star fading, his
country beset with economic problems and his party threatened
by a rejuvenated William Gladstone -- traveled to the
Congress of Berlin in 1878, he patched up Europe for a
generation and returned home to be the first to use the
gilded phrase "peace with honor." It didn't help much.
   Richard Nixon didn't find the solace or salvation he
sought when he traveled to Egypt in June 1974, drawing huge
crowds in Cairo and Alexandria as the House Judiciary
Committee girded to vote on the articles of impeachment and
as the Supreme Court prepared to hand down an 8-0 decision
forcing the president to hand over taped conversations to the
Watergate special prosecutor. "He wanted to show he was still
respected and honored abroad," says Stephen Ambrose, a
University of New Orleans biographer of Mr. Nixon. "The trip
was designed to let it soak in that if Nixon left, we'd be
stuck with Jerry Ford."
   But Mr. Gorbachev did provide a bravura performance, at
least for domestic consumption in the U.S.
   "He's not like most of the Democrats -- he's willing to
take on Bush now and then on issues," says Frank Mankiewicz,
a former campaign adviser to the late Robert Kennedy, and
former Sens. George McGovern and Gary Hart. "And while an
American politician would have tried to hide that birthmark,
he makes a thing of it. His instincts are great."
