   Tokyo stock prices finished lower in moderate trading
Friday after posting gains in the two previous days.
   Meanwhile, London share prices peaked at the close of
moderate trading, tracking Wall Street's firming and scoring
late-day gains on unconfirmed rumors of a takeover bid in the
brewery sector.

   Investors in Japan took profits ahead of the weekend on
domestic demand-related shares, many of which advanced
strongly earlier last week, traders said. Construction
companies were broadly lower. Shipbuilding and steel issues
also declined, while some electrical and mining shares
firmed.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues closed down 239.68
points at 32891.12. The index advanced 204.54 points
Thursday.
   At mid-morning in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index was up
85.88 points to 32977.
   Friday's volume on the first section was estimated at 700
million shares, down from 805 million shares Thursday.
   Declining issues Friday outnumbered advancing issues 541
to 426, while 152 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which gained 18.65 points Thursday, was down
9.19 points, or 0.38%, at 2426.55.
   The second section index, which advanced 35.96 points
Thursday, was up 36.34 points, or 0.91%, to close at 3974.62.
Volume in the second section was estimated at 29 million
shares, up from 18 million shares Thursday.
   Stock prices moved lower in the afternoon. Traders said
investors decided to secure profits on stocks that advanced
in the past few days ahead of the announcement of U.S.
employment data later Friday. The figures, along with the
U.S.-Soviet summit talks in Washington over the weekend, were
expected to affect the direction of exchange rates.
   While they took profits on construction and shipbuilding
shares, investors actively hunted for speculative shares as
well as individual stocks with strong earnings outlooks,
traders said.
   "The market mood was bullish. Investors showed strong
interest searching for stocks with high potential to
advance," said Masami Okuma, a senior trader at UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew International.
   Main buyers last week were individuals and corporate
investors, while most institutional investors took profits on
the recovery in stock prices, said Atsushi Koishihara,
general manager of stock trading at Taiheiyo Securities.
   Active selling by institutional investors in previous
weeks helped reduce selling pressure and made stock prices
resistant to sharp falls, Mr. Okuma of UBS Phillips said.
   The market is expected to firm this week because brokerage
houses are planning to trade actively as they usually do in
the first part of a month, according to some traders.
   In London, the rumors of a brewery takeover bid
precipitated heavy buying in the sector, particularly for
Allied-Lyons shares, as speculation mounted that it was the
focus of a predator. The rumors were unsubstantiated.
   In addition, strong stock futures trading lent support to
shares, as did the continued shortage of stock in the hands
of marketmakers and rumors of a cut in U.S. prime lending
rates.
   The combined effect of these factors sent dealers home
convinced that this week will see robust trading.
   "We'll break through 2400 {on the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index}" early this week, predicted one
trader.
   At the close of Friday trading, the 100 Share Index was up
26.3 points at 2371.4. Its low of the day was reached early
in the session, when the index fell 12.4 points.
   The narrower Financial Times 30 Share Index was up 27.4
points at 1882.4. Volume was 499.3 million shares, above the
466.2 million issues that changed hands Thursday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
ended trading at 2411.0, up from its close of 2379.0
Thursday. Similarly, dealers expected Wall Street to perform
strongly this week.
   Allied-Lyons rose 26 pence to 500 ($8.42) on the rumors.
However, company spokesmen couldn't be reached to comment.
   The entire brewery sector profited from the speculation,
particularly as marketmakers were short of stock in the
sector, following Thursday's brisk buy activity in Guinness
shares. Bass gained 20 pence to #11.04. Guinness gained a
further seven pence to 776.
   Other shares performing well Friday included Rothmans,
which said it was considering the acquisition of the
Theodorus Niemeyer BV group of companies from Gallaher Ltd.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of American Brands Inc.
   One trader said the market took the news well and assumed
that this would signal Rothmans' exit from South African
markets. Rothmans gained 39 pence to 732.
   Shares that fell included Rank, which fell 15 pence to 803
on news that it had bid #512 million ($860.7 million) for
Mecca Leisure.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan. Shares were
lower in Paris, and South African gold stocks closed down.
   Prices closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Seoul and Taipei. They were mixed in Wellington and Manila.
