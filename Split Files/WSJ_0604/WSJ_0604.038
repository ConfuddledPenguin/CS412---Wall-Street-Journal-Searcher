   BEIJING -- Travelers to this orderly city are welcome this
season to visit the Gate of Heavenly Peace, from which
Tiananmen Square takes its name. From the front of the gate
hangs the usual portrait of Mao Tse-tung, commanding the
square. All around are public security agents to ensure there
will be no democratic turmoil to interfere with your climb to
the Tiananmen balcony above. There, the grandeur of China is
on show. Under Tiananmen's imperial yellow roof, looking
south across the huge square, you can stand where Mao stood
in 1949 when he founded his communist People's Republic and
declared, "The Chinese people have stood up."
   Then you can descend to the street where last June 4 the
Chinese people were shot down.

   This first anniversary of the Tiananmen uprising, Beijing
wears a tidy facade that makes it easy to forget the heroic
events of last year. There's a big official effort on to
spruce up the city for the Asian Games, to be held here in
September. Pictures of the panda mascot decorate shops and
billboards. Where tanks rolled toward Tiananmen Square the
roads have been mostly repaved, the sidewalks relaid, the
shops replastered.
   Where protesters shouted and waved banners for democracy,
it's now hard to strike up even a casual conversation. The
Chinese know that anyone seen speaking with foreigners can
expect to be questioned by security agents. With the public
held hostage, the government is slathering on a cosmetic
smile. The Public Security Bureau, last year besieged by
angry workers, now keeps its gates wide open and adorns its
steps with red, purple and yellow potted flowers. Hotels have
been ordered to fly red banners that say "Greeting guests
with smiles and hospitality." They have also been supplied
with computers that tie in to the Public Security Bureau --
to better keep track of the guests. Tiananmen Square has been
closed for this anniversary. But mostly the square is open
again, even after dark, to anyone who cares to share it with
armed police guards.
   Coming up from Hong Kong this past week, I thought it
important to avoid harking back too much to last year's
revolt. The big question is what might lie ahead. But
revisiting this tightly controlled city, I see that last
year's uprising offered the best clue to China's future. It
was only during those few weeks that the Chinese were able to
sidestep their government, talk openly with each other, and
tell the world what they wanted for their country.
   The details of mass revolts are rarely simple, and there
has been much debate outside China this past year over
precisely what the demonstrators hoped to achieve. But one
thing is clear: Just as Mao in the 1920s had a vision that
eventually led to his 1949 victory, these people also had a
dream. The flag that flew from a building near the square
said "democracy." And the white statue that for five days
faced off against the portrait of Mao, and came to symbolize
the movement, stood for liberty.
   This is crucial to remember. It tells us what the people
of Beijing were willing to die for. I have often heard it
argued this past year that all the demonstrators really
wanted were honest officials and greater freedom of speech --
not the overthrow of the Communist Party. Yes, they demanded
an end to corruption and lies. But an end to corruption and
lies means the end of the Communist Party's
self-justification for existence. No one knows this better
than the Chinese people, whose insistent cry last spring was
"Tell the truth."
   The prime truth in China today is that communism has
proved itself a costly fraud. The Chinese people rank among
the poorest in the world, as well as among the most
repressed. The vaunted stability conferred by the party is
also an illusion. There is no provision for orderly
succession, there are no independent institutions of law. No
one knows what might happen when 85-year-old Deng Xiaoping
dies or fades away. Nor is it clear what post his successor
might occupy, since Mr. Deng resigned his last official post
earlier this year. China's government is one of the least
stable on earth.
   It is also one of the most hated. The wide avenues of
Beijing offer a reminder that last year's movement --
accompanied by demonstrations in scores of cities across
China -- was no simple student protest. It was a mass revolt.
To block the army from entering Beijing required citizens
ready to occupy the streets for miles in every direction --
for two solid weeks. When they rushed out at virtually every
major intersection to face gunfire and armored personnel
carriers during the final showdown, they were not protecting
their homes. They were protecting what they knew was the
soldiers' target -- Tiananmen Square, and the goal of freedom
that it stood for.
   For now, China is back to communism as usual, with Party
Secretary Jiang Zemin grinning in a Barbara Walters interview
and dismissing the Tiananmen revolt as "much ado about
nothing." Deng Xiaoping, dictator to one-fifth of humanity,
makes his erratic appearances to scotch rumors that he is
dead. Premier Li Peng hates bourgeois liberal ways, but
welcomes President Bush's decision to renew
most-favored-nation trading status with China. President Yang
Shangkun takes time away from overseeing the ideological
purification of the People's Liberation Army to tour South
America and announce that he's found lots of friends there.
   None of these party leaders speaks for the people of
China. Nor do they offer any grand plan that might lure
people their way. Thanks to its infiltration of the army and
the local work units, the 47 million member party creaks on,
resurrecting its absurd model heroes and cookbook slogans.
"Better Red than expert" is one of the latest mottoes of the
army, where professional soldiering officially ranks second
to politically correct thinking. But Mao's vision of a nation
striving to build the New Socialist Man stirs almost no one.
It had shriveled long before the Chinese army fired on
China's people last year.
   To build socialism, the Chinese endured the horrors of the
Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and the Cultural
Revolution from 1966 to 1976, in which tens of millions died
and hundreds of millions suffered. They emerged from this
hell in the late 1970s to see their noncommunist neighbors
enjoying the Asian economic miracle. And that was what they
wanted. "Take your Diogenes lamp and go wandering around
looking for a true communist. It will be hard to find one
under 50 years old," says one Western diplomat based here.
   The government has no coherent plan to reform the
faltering system. Late last year the party spat forth old
Stalinist cant about replacing market reforms with strict
central planning. Farm enterprises, where freer markets had
served as the main force for development this past decade,
were to be rubbed out. Credit and raw materials were to be
rechanneled mainly to unprofitable state enterprises.
   Now, after almost a year of no economic growth, the party
has backed off and is again making noises about a "managed"
private economy. But the two vital steps of freeing prices
and institutionalizing property rights have been scratched
from this leg of the long march. China's economic policies
are adrift. The main think tanks, where some of the country's
brightest people were planning the moves toward a market
economy, have been broken up. And political reform is dead in
the water.
   This is a vacuum that cannot last. It may be that the fuse
of the next revolt is burning far from Tiananmen Square,
where the regime will not lightly allow people to gather
again. The next firestorm may begin in the richer, coastal
provinces of Guangdong or Fujian, which trade heavily with
the outside world and want nothing to do with China's central
government. It could begin with the Moslems in the western
province of Xinjiang, where at least 22 people died last
month in a separatist revolt and the Beijing government has
stepped up its "security measures." It could start in the
southwestern city of Chengdu, where unemployment combined
with anger over the Beijing massacre ignited riots last June.
Or in Shanghai, where protesters last spring built their own
Statue of Liberty, and backed down only under serious threat
of martial law.
   How long before China rises again is hard to say. But it
must come soon. Tiananmen disclosed publicly what most people
knew: that China's communists have outlived their time. They
have nothing left to offer a country that has been struggling
since the start of this century to join the modern world. And
though China's people lack a detailed agenda, they have
already replaced Mao's communist vision with their call in
Tiananmen Square for democracy.
   This is a country whose long history dwarfs many of the
world's great events. But the world outside is moving faster
than ever before. Observing the prosperity of the West,
following the overthrow of communism in Eastern Europe, the
upheavals in the Soviet Union, and even Burma's vote a week
ago for democracy, the Chinese people know how badly they are
falling behind. They need not reinvent the institutions of
democracy; they need only seize the chance to adopt them.
   The tragedy of June 4 went far beyond the killing in the
streets. The tragedy is that such movements do not always
succeed the first time, and every day lost means further
waste of the great nation that China could be. When I
returned from Beijing last June, after watching that fierce
struggle for freedom, a friend up there sent down a poem,
entitled "Spring Dawn," by an eighth-century Chinese poet,
Meng Haoran. It speaks today not only for a people silently
mourning its loss at Tiananmen, but also for a nation
struggling to awake:
                                                                                                       

   Oversleeping in spring I missed the dawn,
   Now everywhere the cries of birds are heard.
   Tumult of wind and rain had filled the night --
   How many blossoms fell during the storm?
