   LOS ANGELES -- Hotel Investors Trust elected director John
D. Morrissey, 53 years old, president and chief executive
officer, filling the posts vacated by John F. Rothman, 55,
who resigned in March.
   Shares of Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate investment
trust, and Hotel Investors Corp., a hotel-management concern,
are paired for trading. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Friday, Hotel Investors shares closed at $3.50,
unchanged.

   When Mr. Rothman resigned, the companies had said they
didn't plan to elect a replacement, since they are selling
most of their assets in order to pursue other business
interests. But a spokeswoman said Friday that the companies
will still retain about a third of their assets, and that
"the board therefore thought it was necessary to have a
president and CEO." Hotel Investors has been in negotiations
for the asset sales in recent months.
