   IN BUSINESS, getting ahead means knowing how to appear
bright, savvy and ready to contribute something essential --
even when you are not. The key, of course, is knowing the hot
slogans, ersatz verbs and technical jargon of the day.
   Think about it. Imagine you were the executive who first
used the word "synergy" and saw it flower throughout memos,
meetings, speeches and exchanges in the wash and board rooms.
That's power. Of course, maybe you're not into synergy.
Perhaps you interface instead. Or impact as a verb all day
long in a way that helps you achieve superbity. Whatever.
Just be assured: As we barrel down the road to the office of
the future, you're going to need an arsenal of argot. Here,
for a minimal charge, are some of the power words to come.

   ERGATROIDS (n.): These successful executives of the future
will be people who work a lot, work smart, work fast, work
all the time. Work work work. Not an erg will be wasted.
                                                                                                       

   FRITZED (v.): By the year 2000, every human being will
have a computer in his face. And most will have a color
monitor capable of producing 126,987,651 colors, thanks to a
technically suspect process called interlacing.
Unfortunately, interlacing may also produce -- in some
cheaper models -- a vicious flicker. Workers who are forced
to watch this rapidly pulsating image for more than six hours
straight find themselves hypnotized, staring at the screen
and thinking about the nature of existence until their brains
are literally sucked into the operating system of the
machine. After this they are unfit for anything but
participation in focus groups. This process becomes known as
fritzing, since people who have been fritzed seem to answer
to nothing but "Hey, Fritz]"
                                                                                                       

   SPHINXES (n.): Derived from the Greek mythical beast,
which killed any guy who came up with the wrong answer to a
question so cryptic that it didn't really have an answer to
begin with. In the future, the most dreaded executives will
be the sphinxes -- financial types in charge of shrinking
budgets in a shrinking economy. Funding will be tight, and so
will they. Ask why you can't get that new hardware approved,
and they'll just cock an eyebrowand eat your budget line.
                                                                                                       

   POWER TROUGH (n.): By the turn of the century, people will
be so sick of the traditional business lunch that
alternatives will develop. Originating in a Los Angeles deli,
the hot dining trend will involve the sharing of meals at
foot-deep communal food reservoirs running the length of the
eating establishment. Diners will merely pull up a chair and
bib and "hit the trough." When superagent Morton Janklow is
seen "troughing it" with a group that includes Henry
Kissinger and Boris Yeltsin, the power trough becomes a
national institution, supplanted in 2014, when the
food-pellet craze reaches its apogee.
                                                                                                       

   TWEENER (n.): Tweening is the process by which a computer
transforms one geometric form into another. Tweeners will be
individuals who become whatever seems advisable, people who
are willing to eat the end of an octopus's tentacle simply
because they are dining with others who do. Common usage
includes: "Let's get Chuck to OK this. He's such a tweener."
                                                                                                       

   COTTAGEHEADS (n.): Throughout the 1990s, increasing
numbers of people will be forced off the corporate rolls and
condemned to work in their basements, attics and breakfast
nooks, without benefits. Many of these will claim they enjoy
it, and perhaps they will. But extended isolation from the
lunching, munching and grindstone-nosing will take their
toll. Those who can't hack it will be known as cottageheads
-- hairless, querulous, bug-eyed eccentrics, pale from lack
of sunlight, poorly dressed in last decade's outfits, ever
searching for a human being willing to talk for more than the
length of a phone call.
                                                                                                       

   RETROGONZO (n.): RG for short. A derogatory term referring
to older Americans in their 40s who listen to lite rock in
their offices, wear what hair they possess horizontally, and
use expressions like "man," "babe" and "giving something
back" in polite conversation. This quaint evocation of prior
decades makes them the butt of young, hungry snipers in their
20s whose idea of long-term thinking extends all the way to
supper.
                                                                                                       

   PFAFFNERED (v.): The job of tomorrow will be a cluster of
duties that once belonged to up to 23.4 managers with three
support staffs. People who lose focus and get confused will
find themselves pfaffnered by these awesome obligations.
                                                                                                       

   NUNs (n.): This will be the name for the growing number of
ergatroids who shun the use of one of the most powerful
former business tools: social drinking. Instead, they will
adopt a rigid policy of taking Nothing Until Nightfall. Those
who are unable to live by these strict standards flock to
careers in sales and public relations, where they belong.
                                                                                                       

   HEARTHLINGS (n.): Good news] There will the rare
enlightened companies who move into the future with a whole
new outlook. They will grant generous maternity and paternity
leaves, offer lucrative profit-sharing schemes, and implement
other inventive and humane improvements. If you are among the
lucky hearthlings ensconced in these new age lifecorps, you
will enjoy greater security and have more fun than people
were meant to have while making money, not spending it. Won't
that be nice?
