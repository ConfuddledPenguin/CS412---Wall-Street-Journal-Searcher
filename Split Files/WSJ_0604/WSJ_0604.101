   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Investors who lost $192 million
in junk-bond investments by the collapse of American
Continental Corp., parent of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
Association, are close to a settlement with a law firm for
the company, lawyers said.
   Lawyers for Charles H. Keating Jr., former head of Lincoln
and chairman of American Continental, are negotiating with
lawyers for 11,500 bondholders who have sued to recover their
losses.

   Almost 22,000 small investors purchased American
Continental bonds at Lincoln's 29 Southern California
branches. The bonds became worthless after the parent company
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code in April 1989 and federal regulators
seized the thrift unit.
   Ten federal lawsuits, filed on behalf of 11,500
bondholders, were consolidated into one lawsuit.
   A settlement could be completed as early as tomorrow, said
Ken Feinberg of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler
Inc., the firm representing Mr. Keating. A lawyer for the
bondholders said he agreed.
   Any signed settlement is subject to final approval of
federal and state judges hearing the bondholders' lawsuit.
