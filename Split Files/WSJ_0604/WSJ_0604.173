   NEW YORK -- Investors are about to get another opportunity
to join in the baseball card craze without having to worry
about such things as how to value a Mickey Mantle rookie
card.
   Fleer Corp., which describes itself as the third biggest
of six national marketers of sports cards, plans an initial
offering this week of 1.7 million common shares, representing
an 18.5% stake.

   In one sign of investor interest, lead underwriter Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. has been talking about an issue
price of $13 to $15 a share, rather than the $11 to $13
originally expected.
   And even at $13 to $15, the issue would be fairly priced,
says Al Hadhazy, senior analyst for the newsletter New
Issues. There could be more attractive initial public
offerings in the pipeline, he says, but Fleer has strong
fundamentals including a tripling of annual sales between
1986 and 1989.
   "I like the stock," says Robert Natale, an analyst who
tracks new issues at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. At $13 to $15 a
share, he says, the stock would be "less attractive but still
{would have} appeal."
   As interest in baseball cards and other sports
collectibles has boomed, so have Fleer's sales, especially of
its baseball cards packaged with team stickers. On a pro
forma basis, revenue last year was $83.4 million, and net
income was $6.9 million.
   In this year's first quarter, the company's pro forma net
was $6.8 million, or 74 cents a share, compared with $2
million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales climbed
to $40.2 million from $20.6 million.
   The company says in its preliminary prospectus that a
"substantial majority" of its revenue and earnings are
generated in the first half of the year from baseball card
sales.
   Meanwhile, the leading baseball card concern, Topps Co.,
had record sales and net in its year ended March 3. Net was
$37.6 million, or $1.20 a share, on sales of $246.4 million,
after fiscal 1989 net of $28 million, or 89 cents a share, on
sales of $198.8 million.
   A Topps spokesman said he couldn't estimate the company's
share of the baseball card market. In calling itself the No.
3 company, Fleer says in its preliminary prospectus that "the
current market leader has a significantly larger share of the
market for baseball cards than any other entity."
   If the increased interest in baseball card collecting
continues, competition is sure to heat up further, says Mr.
Hadhazy of the New Issues letter. "Any number of companies
can jump into the ball game at any time," he says, and he
doesn't expect Fleer to maintain its growth rate of the past
four years.
   And what if enthusiasm for the cards wanes? Fleer
acknowledges that its sales can be "significantly impacted by
changing consumer tastes and interests."
   Mr. Hadhazy says, "I wouldn't say I'm ready to call it a
fad, but in terms of speculative frenzy, baseball cards are
right up there."
   However, Mr. Natale of S&amp;P says, "It's a faddish business,
but it's also a perennial one." Collectors aren't the only
purchasers of the cards, he points out. Fleer, in fact, says
its primary market is "the young consumer, aged six to 16."
   Fleer markets its baseball and other sports cards under
non-exclusive license agreements with players' associations
and representatives of leagues and teams.
   Fleer says in the preliminary prospectus, "Although there
can be no assurance that new licenses will be granted . . .
the company anticipates that it will obtain new licenses on
terms acceptable to it." Future licenses, however, could be
granted to other companies, and analysts say it's possible
that sports leagues or player groups might eventually decide
to market the cards themselves.
   Fleer began selling baseball cards in 1981. It introduced
basketball cards in 1986 and expects to begin marketing
football cards this summer. The company also makes bubble
gum, mostly marketed under the Dubble Bubble brand, as well
as Razzles, a gum product pressed into the form of a tablet.
   An investment group led by Charterhouse Equity Partners
acquired Fleer last August through a holding company, Charter
Confectionary Inc., for $55.4 million. Charter Confectionary
was merged into Fleer in April of this year. The company says
it doesn't have any current plan to begin paying dividends.
Proceeds from the stock sale will be used to reduce debt.
