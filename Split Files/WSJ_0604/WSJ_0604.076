   DALLAS -- Southland Corp., the troubled 7-Eleven retailer,
is rapidly approaching two crucial dates in its efforts to
restructure $1.8 billion in publicly traded debt and avoid
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   In March, the company agreed to sell 75% of its equity for
$400 million to its Japanese partners, contingent on it
restructuring its debentures and preferred stock outstanding.
Its proposed debt exchange offer, however, has drawn vigorous
opposition from bondholders and has yet to clear the
Securities and Exchange Commission so that it can be put to a
vote.

   Meanwhile, beginning June 14, either Southland or its
Japanese investors, Ito Yokado Ltd. and Seven-Eleven Japan
can cancel the agreement at any time, although neither has
indicated it plans to do so. And on June 15, Southland must
decide whether to pay $69 million in cash interest due on two
of its debt issues and additional pay-in-kind interest due on
another issue. If it chooses to forgo the interest payments
while it tries to restructure the debt, it will have a 30-day
grace period before bondholders can try to force it into
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Southland hasn't yet said whether it will pay the interest
on the debt. But Friday it said that as part of its agreement
with the Japanese, it won't issue a pay-in-kind stock
dividend on its 15% cumulative exchangeable preferred stock
while it tries to swap that stock for new preferred and
common stock. Failure to pay those dividends for six quarters
would allow preferred stockholders to elect as many as two
directors to Southland's board.
   The company issued that preferred stock to its common
shareholders when it went private in a $4.9 billion leveraged
buy-out in 1987. That heavy debt load and disappointing sales
and earnings have strained the company's liquidity, making a
debt restructuring and capital infusion necessary.
   Southland said that it is in negotiations with bondholders
and their advisers, including Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., to
restructure its debt but it wouldn't elaborate on those
discussions.
   Bondholders, however, who have opposed Southland's planned
swap since the day the company described its plans, believe
that Southland's current proposal "is totally unacceptable,"
said John Gordon of Deltec Securities Corp. who is leading a
bondholders' group representing a majority of Southland's
debtholders.
   Mr. Gordon said that a steering committee of about six
institutions made a counterproposal to Southland last week,
although he wouldn't provide any details. "The bondholders as
a group are willing to agree to a restructuring that restores
this company to full financial health as long as it is a fair
one," Mr. Gordon said. But, he said, "I would be hard pressed
to think of an initial exchange offer that could be more
offensive" than Southland's current offer, which was filed
with the SEC in April.
   Among other issues, bondholders are enraged that Southland
plans to replace its current debt, much of which pays cash
interest, with zero-coupon debt that doesn't pay cash
interest and matures at later dates. In addition, under the
plan, the founding Thompson family and companies they control
would continue to own 15% of Southland's equity, giving them
a higher value for every dollar they invested in Southland
stock than many bondholders will receive. Bondholders would
own 10% of the restructured company under the plan.
   Mr. Gordon said he doesn't yet know how willing Southland
is to bend on its offer, but he said that if Southland wants
to defer its June 15 interest payment, it needs to win the
favor of bondholders soon. "I frankly think the next week is
the time when we will know whether we have any real basis for
a consentual restructuring," he said.
