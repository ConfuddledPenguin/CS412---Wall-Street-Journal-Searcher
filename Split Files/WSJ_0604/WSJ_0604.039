   Capital Cities/ABC's plan to slash the audience-size
guarantees it usually promises advertisers is prompting the
other two major networks to come up with similar plans --
despite ferocious resistance from advertisers.
   National Broadcasting Co. said in a statement Friday that
ABC's plan, which virtually factors out recent declines in
audience ratings, is "both actionable and equitable." It
added that it is "taking a closer look at their approach,
along with some others." David Niles, vice president of re-
search at the No. 1 network, said the General Electric unit
hoped to put together its own plan discounting TV's shrinking
audience by the end of this week.

   CBS, too, is accelerating efforts to slice guarantees made
to advertisers regarding audience size. "We're looking at the
ABC proposal and exploring other ideas of our own as well,"
said Jerry Dominus, a CBS senior vice president. He said CBS
hoped to come up with its own plan "within a week or so."
Added David Poltrack, a senior vice president, "At this
point, we feel the current system isn't a reliable guide and
not one that we can recommend."
   Ad executives and analysts continue to insist that ABC's
plan and others like it are doomed to failure. The plans came
about because A.C. Nielsen ratings have shown a steep decline
in audience levels, with viewers apparently deserting the
tube in droves during the first quarter. All three major
networks insist that the Nielsen data are flawed, and the
plans they're fashioning for setting ad rates are meant to
factor out the declines. But advertisers claim the Nielsen
data are perfectly accurate.
   "I don't think {the ABC plan} can possibly fly," says
James Dougherty, an advertising analyst with County NatWest
Securities. The networks have complained about Nielsen's
figures before, he notes, yet the numbers "have never been
confirmed wrong. I can't see any responsible agency or
advertiser allowing ABC to do that."
   As reported, ABC last week shattered tradition by coming
up with its new plan to sell ad time. ABC and its fellow
networks have a pile of cash at stake: Typically, they
guarantee advertisers that their programs will reach a
certain number of viewers. If ratings fall below the
guaranteed level, the networks must make up the difference
with additional free commercial time, called "makegoods." The
ratings slide this year was so severe that in the first half
of this year alone, the estimated value of their makegoods
reached $150 million to $200 million.
   ABC's plan would slash the amount of free time it must
give advertisers if audience levels fall. The plan compares
current ratings with an average of the three previous years;
a particular program's ratings would have to fall more than
the average audience fell over those three years in order for
the advertiser to be entitled to makegoods.
   While NBC and CBS are looking at ABC's new system, they
also are examining other alternatives to the traditional
audience-guarantee system. The result is likely to be a
mishmash of approaches that will cause chaos during the
coming "up-front" buying spree, when advertisers buy network
time for the fall season.
   In making its announcement last week, ABC said it was
opening the up-front season. But industry executives said
that if anything, ABC's plans and those under consideration
by its competitors would slow down the process as advertisers
attempt to interpret the new plans. At CBS, Mr. Poltrack
figures the up-front market won't start until the latter part
of this month, and adds, "certainly this kind of wrinkle
would make that slower than what has traditionally been the
case."
   Executives at both CBS and NBC were scrambling late last
week to evaluate ABC's plan and to compare it to those they
already had under consideration. NBC, for example, said that
one plan it is considering would take into account data other
than the national Nielsen ratings, such as local Nielsen and
Arbitron figures. The local data showed that the number of
female viewers in the 18-to-49 age group was flat to down
slightly in the first quarter. By contrast, the Nielsen
ratings showed that group plummeted by 6% to 10%, depending
on the time of day.
   "We're exploring ways of calibrating or looking at trends
in local markets and somehow relating that to the national
numbers," Mr. Niles said.
   CBS initially hoped Nielsen would devise an alternative
ratings system itself. The Committee on Nationwide Television
Audience Measurement, a coalition of the three networks and
the National Association of Broadcasters, had asked Nielsen
to introduce an alternative system that could be used in
conjunction with the current people meter system. But Nielsen
last week told the networks it couldn't provide any
experimental system until next March at the earliest, CBS's
Mr. Poltrack said, adding, "That whole idea is going up in
smoke. Now we're looking at the ABC proposal and exploring
other ideas."
   Advertisers say they will resist any new ad-rate plans. If
the networks insist on slashing guarantees, the advertisers
say, they'll demand compensation. For example, they might try
to negotiate lower than normal ad rates or better placement
in programs, media executives suggested.
   Says Rich Hamilton, a senior vice president at ad agency
D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, "ABC is going to have to be
willing -- and I think ABC knows that it will need -- to
negotiate on the particulars of the announcement. Whether
they go back to the same kind of guarantee system that
existed in the past is going to be negotiated individually by
agencies and advertisers."

   McCann Wins 3 Accounts
                                                                                                       

   McCann-Erickson picked up three new accounts -- including
a big assignment from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph -- that
together add about $30 million to the agency's billings.
   The AT&amp;T assignment, a consolidation of the company's
facsimile machine business, will bill about $15 million to
$20 million. McCann beat three other shops to win the
account, which will include advertising AT&amp;T's fax services
and products.
   McCann also picked up the film account from Agfa Corp.'s
photo division. Billings haven't been determined.
   And the agency was named to handle Nordica S.p.A.'s $10
million ski boot and apparel account. The multinational
account will be serviced out of McCann's New York and Milan
offices. McCann is an Interpublic Group agency.

   IBM: International Business Machines Europe said it added
Lintas:Europe to its European ad-agency roster. IBM said
Lintas, through its Paris office, would handle a special
assignment that it declined to identify. It said, however,
that its agreement with Lintas doesn't affect its
relationship with GGK, which handles IBM accounts in Europe.
Billings weren't disclosed. Lintas is an Interpublic unit.
                                                                                                       

   VIRGIN ISLANDS: The U.S. Virgin Islands this week will
