   In his attempt to portray the massacre by the crazed
Israeli gunman as an extension of the Israeli government's
plot to exterminate Palestinians, Alexander Cockburn points
to several examples of Israeli extremism ("Gunman Deranged?
No More Than Israel's Anti-Arab Policy," Viewpoint, May 24).
   Mr. Cockburn quotes an account from the May 18 edition of
the Hebrew daily Ha'aretz that says that the president of
Israel, Chaim Herzog, and the military commander of the West
Bank, Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, attended a celebration in
Elkana honoring Rabbi Moshe Levinger, head of the Gush Emunim
(who was convicted of negligent manslaughter when he
indiscriminately fired his gun and killed an innocent
Palestinian after his car was pelted with rocks). In fact,
there was no such account in Ha'aretz or any other Israeli
newspaper on May 18 or any other day. Why? No such ceremony
honoring Rabbi Levinger ever occurred. There was indeed a
celebration in Elkana, at which both Gen. Mordechai and
President Herzog were in Elkana -- but it was to mark the
13th anniversary of the founding of the settlement by the
Labor Party. It had nothing whatsoever to do with Rabbi
Levinger.

   Mr. Cockburn also quotes Rabbi Moshe Neriya as saying that
"the rabbi enjoined every Jew `to shoot {Arabs} left and
right without thinking and without hesitation.'" In fact,
what Rabbi Neriya said, according to a transcript of his
interview, was as follows: "As someone who has tasted the
feeling of being under a rain of heavy rocks, whose life was
in danger, of being killed or severe injury, I know how
someone who defends himself feels. . . . When you are
attacked {by murderers}, it is not the time to think but to
shoot right and left and to bring about the dispersal of the
murderers who are upon you." To twist Rabbi Neriya's
statement into a call for mass murder is an outright lie.
   Mr. Cockburn also alleges that Knesset member Rehavam
Ze'evi and Deputy Foreign Minister Binyamin Netanyahu support
"mass deportation of Palestinians." In fact, Mr. Netanyahu is
flatly opposed to such a policy. Mr. Ze'evi, a former Labor
Party member, supports a mutually agreed upon population
exchange with Arab regimes, similar to the Greek-Turkish
exchange of the 1920s. Without getting into a discussion on
Mr. Ze'evi's views (which I personally consider to be
patently ridiculous and extremist), Mr. Ze'evi is against any
forced exile, contrary to Mr. Cockburn's allegation. The only
major Israeli figure who supports forced exile is Meir
Kahane, who -- Mr. Cockburn neglects to point out -- has been
barred from running for office and who is boycotted by the
press.
   Mr. Cockburn also quotes Israel Shahak as a human-rights
authority. The problem is that Mr. Shahak is so extreme in
his views that Israeli human-rights organizations have been
forced to distance themselves from him. Mr. Shahak is no more
of an authority on Israeli human-rights violations than
Lyndon LaRouche is an authority on U.S. human-rights
violations.
   Mr. Cockburn alleges that the Israeli gunman may not have
been really crazy as evidenced by the interview conducted
with his neighbors by Newsday reporters. What Mr. Cockburn
neglected to say was that his own family said he was
disturbed and that he was dishonorably discharged from the
Israeli army.
   There is no doubt that racism and extremism exist in
Israel and that the repression of the Palestinian uprising
has been brutal. But Israel can no more be held to blame for
the actions of a madman than the U.S. can be blamed for the
actions of the crazed killer who walked into a McDonald's
several years ago in California and shot 21 people to death.
   Racism and extremism can be found in every society -- from
Egypt's ruthless repression of the Christian Copts to the
Sudan's continued enslavement of blacks to the scores of
unarmed young black men shot by white policemen across the
U.S. Any society covered by the media's same one-sided
scrutiny as Israel has been would end up being demonized in
the eyes of the world. The question for journalists -- who
have at their disposal the world's largest magnifying lens --
is whether Israel is really worse than these other societies
or whether there is a hidden agenda present in the selective
focus on Israel and the dangerous absence of any similar
focus on any other society.
   Mr. Cockburn entertains no such questions. In his
obsession with Israel, he has turned a blind eye to much
worse inter-Arab brutality and the celebration of Jewish
deaths in Arab society.
   As I wrote in my May 22 editorial-page article,
commentators who blame societies for individualized acts of
violence usually have an ideological agenda. In Mr.
Cockburn's case, the agenda may also be financial. It ought
to be remembered that several years ago (in a case
well-publicized at the time) Mr. Cockburn secretly took
$10,000 from an organization that had been funded primarily
by the governments of Iraq and Libya and by a bank known as
the PLO's bank.
   I want to thank Mr. Cockburn for confirming the
correctness of my original thesis.
