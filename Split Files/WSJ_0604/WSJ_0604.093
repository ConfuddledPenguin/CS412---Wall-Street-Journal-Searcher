   EDMONTON, Alberta -- The government of Alberta said it
intends to privatize the Alberta Government Telephones
Commission after passage of legislation that would
restructure AGT financially and legally.
   The Alberta Treasury said all AGT debentures outstanding,
payable in Canadian and U.S. funds, will continue to be
unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the provincial government.

   Under the restructuring, all AGT assets, including
investments in nonregulated entities, will be owned by wholly
owned subsidiaries of a new holding company. A public
offering of common shares in the holding company would
follow.
