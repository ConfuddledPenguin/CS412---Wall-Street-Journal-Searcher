   BOULDER, Colo. -- Daisy Systems Corp. said some of its
bondholders filed a petition in federal court in Denver
seeking to force it into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
   The struggling maker of computer-aided engineering
stations has been in default on $118 million in debt for
several months, starting with missed interest payments last
November. Much of the debt was incurred when Daisy acquired
Cadnetix Corp. for $200 million at the end of 1988. About $40
million of the debt is in the form of secured loans, with the
balance comprising two series of convertible debentures.

   A Daisy spokeswoman said bondholders and the secured
creditor, Heller Financial Inc., have held a series of
discussions to avert the bankruptcy filing. But a one-year
statute of limitations on the right to file the action,
created by the Cadnetix acquisition, expired May 30. The
petition was filed before the deadline, according to the
spokeswoman, but negotiations continue "and meanwhile we are
operating our business as usual."
   But disappointing sales and resulting losses have
continued the company's liquidity problems. Daisy posted a
loss for the first quarter ended Dec. 31 of $18.3 million, or
$1.03 a share, wiping out remaining shareholder equity.
Second-quarter results continued the trend, as the company's
net loss widened to $21.6 million, or $1.08 a share, from
$10.4 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
slumped to $33 million from $47.2 million.
   Daisy closed Friday in over-the-counter trading at 37.5
cents a share, down 12.5 cents.
