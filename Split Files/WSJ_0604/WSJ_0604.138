   PORTLAND, Ore. -- PacifiCorp said it temporarily stopped
open-market purchases of its stock in order to allow a quiet
period for setting an exchange ratio related to the $250
million stock and cash acquisition of North-West
Telecommunications Inc.
   PacifiCorp, an electric and telephone utility, has been
buying its stock to accumulate the about 10.5 million shares
it will need at current prices to complete the North-West
purchase.

   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, PacifiCorp closed at $21.50, unchanged.
   As reported, PacifiCorp's agreement to buy the La Crosse,
Wis.-based telephone company calls for it to pay North-West
holders $225 million of PacifiCorp common stock plus $25
million in cash.
   PacifiCorp had about 247.1 million common shares issued at
March 31. However, of that total, it held about 7.5 million
shares in treasury for the North-West transaction. A
spokesman declined to say how many shares PacifiCorp has
repurchased since March 31.
   PacifiCorp said it ceased repurchases on Friday and
expects to value its stock for the North-West transaction
based on open-market trading in 10 trading days between June
5 and June 18. After that latter date, it may resume
repurchases, PacifiCorp said.
   A spokesman said the suspension of repurchases isn't
related to PacifiCorp's $1.82 billion all-cash bid to acquire
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. That offer, made last month, has
been rejected by Pinnacle West, an electric utility based in
Phoenix, Ariz.; however, PacifiCorp has hinted that it may
pursue Pinnacle West despite its board's opposition.
