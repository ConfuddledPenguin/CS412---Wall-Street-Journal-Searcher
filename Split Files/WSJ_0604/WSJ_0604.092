   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank said it will
guarantee a $20.4 million loan to Israel Aircraft Industries
Ltd. for the purchase of equipment from U.S. suppliers.
   The Israeli government-owned aerospace company plans to
buy aircraft engines, test equipment and other machinery for
manufacturing, modifying and repairing commercial aerospace
products. The Ex-Im Bank said the Garrett Engine Division of
Allied-Signal Aerospace Co., a Phoenix, Ariz., subsidiary of
Allied-Signal Inc., will be the primary supplier of the
equipment, which is valued at about $24 million.
