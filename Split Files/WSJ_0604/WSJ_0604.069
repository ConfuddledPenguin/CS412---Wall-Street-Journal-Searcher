   These should be good times for companies that view their
employee pension plans as a source of ready cash.
   After years of bitter litigation, they've pretty much won
the right to tap into those plans and grab any accumulated
surplus -- that is, any money beyond what is needed to pay
pensions.

   "If a company jumps through the right hoops, it can take
it," says Robert Nagle, a pension benefits lawyer in
Washington. The payoff can be worth millions.
   Companies, though, don't always jump through the right
hoops. So workers now are pressing lawsuits designed to show
on a case-by-case basis that a company can't take the surplus
because it hasn't met all the requirements for doing so.
   Last year, for example, a federal court in Milwaukee
rejected Wisconsin Porcelain Co.'s bid to siphon off its
pension surplus, concluding that it hadn't complied with some
of the plan's prerequisites. Other potentially important
cases are pending in Richmond, Va., against Mead Corp., and
in Houston against Chevron Corp. Meanwhile, Congress, which
previously has taken steps to limit employer access to
pension money, is considering whether it should impose
additional restrictions.
   "I guess you could say employers won the war, but the
battles are still raging," says Norman P. Stein, a University
of Alabama law professor who has represented employees in
several pension-fund suits.
   At issue are so-called private-sector defined-benefit
pension plans, under which an employer promises a worker
specified annual retirement income. The plans are funded
through employer contributions, projected to cover the
company's liabilities. When the stock market soared in the
1980s, the value of many pension funds, which invest in the
market, also rose, often creating huge surpluses.
   Federal pension law requires that as long as a plan is in
effect, its funds must be used only to benefit participating
workers and retirees. But the law also lets companies
terminate a plan any time as long as they meet existing
pension obligations.
   In some cases, companies take the surplus, then simply
start a new pension plan to cover future obligations. But
without any cushion, employees complain, a pension plan is
vulnerable to downturns in the stock market and can't provide
periodic cost-of-living increases for retirees.
   In other situations, employers don't restart the pension
fund, but instead offer workers lump-sum payments, or buy
annuities that pay fixed yearly amounts in retirement. In
effect, employees stop accumulating pension benefits.
   But employers say the surpluses exist because they have
successfully managed their pensions, so they should have
access to the spoils. And the spoils have been huge. In the
1980s, some 2,000 companies grabbed an estimated $20 billion
in surpluses. Thousands of plans still haven't been
terminated -- and some analysts say 80% of those are
overfunded, by a total estimated at up to $600 billion.
   "It's like a magnet," says Michael S. Gordon, a Washington
lawyer who has handled pension-fund cases. "The surplus is
sticking out there like a big neon sign, saying, `Someone
come and get me.'"
   Courts generally have said employers own the extra money
so long as certain conditions are met. The pension plan must
specify, for example, that the employer can take the surplus.
Most employers are careful to include such language in their
plans, but any uncertainty in the wording usually draws a
legal challenge from employee groups.
   Mr. Stein of the University of Alabama says he is involved
in a case where the formal pension plan gives the employer a
right to take the surplus but in an accompanying summary
description of the plan the employer promises not to do so.
"We're arguing that the employer should be bound by
representations made in the summary," says Mr. Stein.
   Conflicting language also lies at the heart of the
Wisconsin Porcelain case. The company decided in 1988 to end
its pension plan and recapture a $4.2 million surplus. It
relied on an amendment to its plan, approved by six "managing
partners," that authorized it to take any excess money.
   But an employee group said the amendment was invalid
because a clause in the plan required all partners to approve
big changes, and 91 "general partners" didn't sign. U.S.
District Judge John Shabaz agreed. The company is appealing.
   Employees in the Chevron case are attacking still another
problem, growing out of Chevron's 1984 acquisition of Gulf
Oil Corp. Gulf's pension plan clearly didn't contain language
authorizing the company to claim any surplus. But Chevron's
plan did. In 1986, Chevron merged the two plans. It then laid
off thousands of employees, giving them severance pay from
funds in the merged plan, including an estimated $200 million
of surplus from the Gulf plan, former Gulf workers allege.
Chevron also used the Gulf surplus to pay supplemental
benefits to Chevron retirees, the suit says.
   Plaintiffs argue that under federal tax laws, Chevron's
actions amounted to a termination of the Gulf pension plan.
And since the plan didn't authorize the company to take the
surplus, they say, it reverts to Gulf's employees. The
class-action suit, brought on behalf of 40,000 former Gulf
employees, seeks to recover the surplus, which it estimates
at several hundred million dollars.
   Chevron says it didn't terminate the Gulf plan, so the
surplus isn't up for grabs. The case is scheduled to go to
trial next month in U.S. District Court in Houston.
   "There probably will be some law made in this case
concerning a company's obligation in these mergers," says H.
Lee Godfrey, a lawyer with Susman Godfrey in Houston, counsel
for the plaintiffs.
   Employees in the Mead case aren't focusing on the
employer's legal right to claim a surplus. Instead, they say
Mead first must pay additional benefits, which would reduce
the size of the surplus left for the company. In 1983, Mead
sold its Lynchburg Foundry Co. subsidiary, terminated the
unit's pension plan and claimed an $11 million surplus. The
employees contend the sale and termination unfairly kept them
from later qualifying for full early-retirement pay provided
for in the pension plan.
   They had argued that full pay should be awarded anyway,
because it's the kind of "benefit" that pension law requires
employers to satisfy before claiming any surplus. Last June,
the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that argument, but it
remanded the case to the federal appeals court in Richmond to
decide if certain other pension-law requirements -- covering
contingent "liabilities," for instance -- obligate Mead to
pay full early-retirement benefits.
   Despite such cases, some experts contend employees are
fighting a losing cause in the courts. They say workers stand
a better chance in Congress, where legislative committees
have been considering proposals that would tighten the
circumstances under which employers could recoup pension
surpluses. But the litigation isn't likely to end soon, says
Evelyn Jo Wilson, another Susman Godfrey lawyer involved in
the Chevron case.
   "It would be astonishing to me if people just stopped
bringing cases," she says. "There's too much money at stake
-- and too much pain involved."
