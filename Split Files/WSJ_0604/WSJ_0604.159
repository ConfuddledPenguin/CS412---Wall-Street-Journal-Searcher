   The Sierra Club is now unabashedly in the muck of partisan
politics, trying to defeat two California initiatives
tomorrow that would end the gerrymandering that ensures
Democratic advantage in drawing election districts. A TV ad
shows a hand pulling an oil-sodden otter from the water. Then
actor James Garner (sic transit "Maverick") says the
initiatives "could let big business exploit our oceans, trees
and few remaining wilderness areas. The Sierra Club says no
on 118, no on 119."
