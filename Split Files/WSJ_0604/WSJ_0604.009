   REDMOND, Wash. -- Nintendo of America Inc. filed a
copyright infringement suit Thursday against the South San
Francisco-based Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. The dispute is over
"Game Genie," a new video device Galoob will unveil soon that
can turn even the least nimble-fingered Nintendo game player
into a pro.
   Nintendo complains that Game Genie, a "video game
enhancer," makes Nintendo games too easy to play -- by
instilling the games' characters with wizardly powers to
avoid dangers and literally fly over obstacles. Simply by
plugging the Game Genie into a Nintendo home-video hardware
unit, players can make the main characters jump higher, float
over objects and even enjoy "infinite lives." With Game
Genie, the characters in Super Mario Brothers -- Nintendo's
best-selling game -- become truly supermen.

   Earlier in May, Galoob announced its plan to start
shipping Game Genie. Nintendo, which has also fired off a
round of copyright infringement suits recently against
several other competitors, immediately put Galoob on notice
that it considered the Game Genie a threat to its copyright.
   Galoob responded by filing a suit against Nintendo in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco on May 17, asking for a court
order that declares Game Genie does not infringe on
Nintendo's copyrights.
   "Nintendo is denying game users the right to make the
choices they want to make," says Steven M. Klein, executive
vice president and general counsel of Galoob. "If you're a
seven-year-old kid who plays 24 hours a day, that's one
thing," he says, but non-whiz kids -- himself included -- can
play for months and wind up nowhere. Super Mario Brothers,
for example, has eight levels, or "worlds," but "I've never
been able to get to the end," complains Mr. Klein.
   That's the whole point, says Howard Lincoln, Nintendo's
senior vice president, who also confesses that he's not good
enough at Super Mario to make it to the end either. "It's
supposed to be a challenge," he says. "With Game Genie, I can
get to World 8 in 13 seconds. Where's the fun in that?"
   Nintendo officials fear that, by making it too simple,
players will get bored and quit playing. It's "like giving
candy to a baby," Mr. Lincoln says.
   Nintendo's suit asks for unspecified damages and a court
ruling that the Game Genie infringes on its copyright. But
the complaint doesn't ask to stop shipment of the device. Mr.
Lincoln said he expected that Nintendo would ultimately seek
such an injunction.
   Galoob said that its initial research finds "very strong
interest" in Game Genie. The company plans to ship hundreds
of thousands of the genies to the stores by next month, where
the devices will retail at about $50.
