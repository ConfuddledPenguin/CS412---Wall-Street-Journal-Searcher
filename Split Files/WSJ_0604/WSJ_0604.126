   Allianz AG Chairman Wolfgang Schieren said the West German
insurance giant's planned investment in East Germany will
total at least one billion marks ($589.2 million).
   Mr. Schieren said in an interview with the weekly business
magazine Wirtschaftswoche that the sheer costs of Allianz's
plan to buy into the East German insurance market also have
made it less controversial, because "in the Bonn Economics
Ministry, as well as at the Cartel Office, people realize
that financially strong companies are needed for the economic
reconstruction of East Germany."

   Allianz said in late March that it intended to take a 40%
stake in East Germany's state insurance monopoly. In the face
of strong criticism, Allianz repeatedly asserted it isn't
intent on monopolizing the newly opened East German insurance
market. Mr. Schieren said that "we don't want to buy a state
monopoly to continue it as a private monopoly, but all
insurance companies from West Germany and other foreign
countries can start in East Germany at the same time."
