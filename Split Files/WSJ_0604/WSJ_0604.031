   Steel is on the rebound -- at least for now.
   Following nearly a yearlong freefall, prices for steel
products are on the rise, and so is demand. Some steelmakers
are restarting blast furnaces that only in March were down
because of slack business, and are recalling workers
furloughed since last fall.

   Although the industry doesn't expect to recapture
immediately the profit or shipment levels of 1987, 1988 and
early 1989, steel executives are more confident about 1990
than they were at the beginning of the year. Barring a strike
in the auto industry -- steel's big customer -- "business
should be reasonably good" this year, says David Hoag,
president of LTV Steel Co.
   About this time last year, steelmakers began nervously
watching prices tumble, signaling the end to a two-year
world-wide recovery in steel. By August, world spot prices
for standard rolled steel had fallen about 10%, and
steelmakers began boosting discounts by $20 a ton on sheet
steel products, marking the first broad-based price drop in
recent years.
   Now the nation's largest steelmakers are effectively
increasing prices. In April, the spot price of steel had
risen to $418 a ton, from $407 a ton in March, according to
AUS Consultants. And the price of hot rolled and cold rolled
steel, used to make everything from appliances to cars, is
slated to rise by $15 a ton and $20 a ton, respectively,
effective with July 1 shipments.
   "I think we've stemmed the erosion," says Thomas Graham,
president of USX Corp.'s USS division. Major steelmakers even
wrested an average 1% increase from General Motors Corp., the
largest steel consumer, even though the tough auto maker, in
the wake of its own disappointing performance, wanted to
slash prices.
   It isn't only the big integrated steelmakers moving to
recapture margins lost over the past nine months. Mini-mills,
which make steel with scrap or recycled steel, increased
prices on rebar and structural products used in construction
between $5 and $20 a ton following a year long decline in
those prices. Stainless sheet and strip prices likewise were
increased between 5% and 8%, marking the first price boost of
those products since July 1988.
   Two factors triggered the recent price increases: brisk
demand and rising costs of raw materials, such as zinc and
nickel. Steel industry analysts, while noting that shipments
won't reach last year's 84-million-ton level, have
confidently boosted their 1990 estimates to more than 80
million tons from earlier estimates of about 78 million tons.
   After watching direct shipments to car makers steadily
drop on a year-ago basis by double digit percentages,
including a 33% drop in January, auto makers are gearing up
for full production. WEFA Group's Christopher Plummer expects
a 20% increase in second-quarter auto production, compared
with the depressed first quarter. And John Tumasoz, an
analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.,
expects robust auto production to continue through September
in advance of labor talks with United Auto Workers, in the
event there is a strike.
   But auto makers aren't the only ones driving steel demand.
Oil producers, drilling more wells, need steel pipe. Farm
equipment makers are building more huge steel-plated combines
and tractors. Steel service centers, which spent much of last
year drawing down inventories, are beginning to buy steel
again. The average daily shipping rate for that $24
billion-a-year industry is running nearly even with last
year's record pace. And, notes Mr. Tumasoz, an expected 7% to
8% increase in 1990 capital spending should translate into
more across-the-board business.
   Moreover, there are fewer imports chasing after these
orders. "Imports are down rather significantly," according to
LTV's Mr. Hoag. Imports have dropped to about 15% of the
market from a recent high in October of 20.7%.
   Still, the welcomed upturn is being viewed cautiously by
those who know too well the industry's cyclicality. Some
steel distributors wonder whether car makers will remain
strong past the third quarter, noting that they don't see the
same high levels of overtime that characterized recent years.
   "It's better than it was in the second half of 1989 but
not as good as it was a year or 18 months ago," says Andrew
Sharkey, president of the Steel Service Center Institute, a
trade group that represents 85% of the steel service center
industry. He says members worry that rising interest rates
could slow down the already sluggish construction industry.
Steel service centers account for more than 20% of all direct
purchases from steelmakers.
   And Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for DRI/McGraw-Hill,
expects the average steel prices to drop 3% in 1990 and
imports to rise throughout the rest of the year. Indeed, if
world spot prices continue to drop, and the Europe market is
stuffed with excess steel, foreign steelmakers may
increasingly look to the U.S. to ship their product.
   "That could nip this rally," says Peter Marcus, a steel
analyst with PaineWebber. Still, Mr. Marcus remains confident
that steel will be relatively strong in the U.S. through
1992.
   The fact that major steelmakers posted profits at all
during the past four dismal quarters is impressive, some
note. John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants, says
the industry has slashed fixed costs by 20% and variable
costs by 10% since 1986. The steel industry, he says, is
"structurally improved."
