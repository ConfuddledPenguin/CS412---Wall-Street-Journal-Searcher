   Interests linked to Texas investors Sid and Lee Bass have
sued Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., alleging that the securities firm
defrauded them of more than $52 million in an October 1989
rights offering by First Executive Corp.
   The litigation, filed early last month in Fort Worth
federal court, surfaced publicly only recently. It seeks
unspecified actual and punitive damages as well as recision
of the purchase of First Executive securities. At March 31,
Airlie Group held an 8.9% stake in First Executive, which
isn't named as a defendant in the suit.

   A Kidder Peabody spokesman disputed the suit's allegations
and said "we don't think the complaint is well grounded and
expect that our view of the matter will prevail."
   The plaintiffs include two personal holding companies
bearing the brothers' names -- Sid R. Bass Inc., Lee M. Bass
Inc.; Airlie Group L.P., a limited partnership based in
Greenwich, Conn., whose general partners are investor Dort A.
Cameron III and a holding company operated by Fort Worth
investor Thomas Taylor; and Mr. Cameron individually.
   The action by the Bass brothers' interests and Airlie is
the latest of a number of suits relating to the rights
offering of First Executive, a Los Angeles-based insurance
holding company. Much of the earlier litigation has been
consolidated as a purported class action in federal court in
Los Angeles.
   The Bass brothers and Airlie allege that Kidder, a General
Electric Corp. unit described in the suit as in financial
straits last year and badly in need of the estimated $5
million in fees that would result, underwrote a $284 million
"exotic securities package" for First Executive. The package
consisted of rights units which entitled holders to buy a
package of convertible preferred stock and warrants to buy
common stock.
   The suit alleges that the prospectus related to the issue
omitted key information about First Executive. Not long after
the successful securities sale, First Executive disclosed
that its junk bond holdings were overvalued by hundreds of
millions of dollars. Insurance regulators rejected a
complicated securities transaction intended to boost legally
required reserves. And an anticipated $460 million sale of
First Executive's New York unit fell through.
   First Executive's stock price plummeted from about $12.25
a share when the rights offering was completed to as low as
$2.25 a share earlier this year.
   First Executive stock closed Friday at $2.50 a share in
over-the-counter trading. The company, noting that it isn't
named as a defendant in the latest lawsuit, declined comment.
