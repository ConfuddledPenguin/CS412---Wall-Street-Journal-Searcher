   General Motors Corp. has started recalling about 410,000
1985-model cars that exceed the federal exhaust standard for
carbon monoxide, the Environmental Protection Agency said.
   The models are the Buick Electra, Century and Somerset
Regal; the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency, Calais and
Cutlass Ciera and Cruiser; and the Pontiac Grand Am. All have
3.0- or 3.8-liter multiport fuel-injected engines.

   The repair, which should take about 30 minutes, is free.
The EPA discovered the problem during routine testing. To
correct it, GM will install a modified computer memory chip
to alter the engine's air-fuel calibration.
   Excessive amounts of carbon monoxide -- a byproduct of
incomplete fuel combustion -- can weaken heart contractions,
and can be particularly harmful to people with lung disease,
anemia or cerebral-vascular disease.
