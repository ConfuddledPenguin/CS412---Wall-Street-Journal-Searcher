   WASHINGTON -- Perry Mason might have called it "The Case
of the Shrinking Docket."
   The Supreme Court's docket is dwindling in a number of
significant ways, and no one -- not even the justices -- is
quite sure why.

   Privately, a number of justices say there is no collective
effort to cut back on their workload. Nor is there agreement
among legal experts about whether the relative lull
represents a profound change in the court's caseload or is
just an aberration.
   But many lawyers who practice regularly at the high court
agree on one thing: The justices are turning down plenty of
good cases.
   For the current term, in which hearings have ended and
decisions will be issued until late June, the justices heard
132 hourlong arguments. That is 19 hours less than they had
allotted and 13 hours less than they heard last year, which
itself was relatively light in volume. Five years ago, they
heard 24 more hours of arguments.
   Moreover, at the justices' present pace of granting review
to cases, their calendar will be even more sparse in the next
term, which will begin Oct. 1.
   In order to give lawyers time to write briefs, cases that
are granted Supreme Court review in the spring typically are
argued in the fall; those granted review in the fall are
typically argued in late winter or the following spring.
   The justices have only four weeks before their summer
recess, and they have 44 hours of argument to fill for
October and November. To date, they are 15 hours short; they
would have to accelerate the granting of cases significantly
to fill the time.
   Even more problematic are the 24 hours allotted for
argument in December. The December calendar usually is filled
with cases granted review the previous spring, but since the
justices appear unlikely to fill even the November argument
calendar, they aren't likely to have enough cases ready to
hear in December. And they probably won't be able to fill the
gap with cases that are granted review in October. The
court's rules allow a total of 82 days for both sides to file
briefs, so cases granted review in October ordinarily
wouldn't be ready for argument in December, unless the
justices speed things up.
   It isn't just granted cases that are down. The court has
two kinds of petitioners: those who must pay the $300 fee to
file, and indigent people -- usually prison inmates -- for
whom the fee is waived. Not surprisingly, as prison
populations rise, the number of unpaid appeals is increasing.
But curiously, as the volume of litigation continues to
mushroom in state and federal courts, the number of paid high
court appeals this term -- 1,851 -- is 80 fewer than last
term and 108 fewer than two years ago.
   Most likely many factors are contributing to the shrinking
docket. One factor is that Congress a couple of years ago
eliminated a certain type of appeal that the court had
relatively little discretion to reject; that gave the court
more control over which cases it will hear.
   In addition, one theory is that Justice Antonin Scalia,
who joined the court in 1986, tends to vote to hear only
cases he considers sufficiently important, while retired
Chief Justice Warren Burger was more inclined to vote to hear
them simply because he disagreed with the appeals court.
   Another theory is that the numerous appeals court judges
appointed by President Reagan are deciding cases on narrower
grounds than before, giving the high court less to examine.
   Whatever the cause, the justices give no indication that
they are worried about the lull; many experts say the court
previously was deciding too many cases.
   But a look at some cases that have been denied review adds
to the mystery; although such judgments are subjective, a
number appeared to offer issues that could have used a high
court solution.
   Recently, the court let stand a federal appeals court
ruling requiring the state of Georgia to defend itself at a
trial against charges it isn't providing enough funds for
criminal defense lawyers who represent indigent defendants.
The ruling deeply divided the judges of the appeals court in
Atlanta, and nine other states backed Georgia's appeal, which
raises constitutional issues.
   Another case the court rejected presented a recurring
question about whether federal labor law pre-empts certain
state employment lawsuits. The appeal was filed by General
Motors Corp. in a dispute with 32 former employees who
accepted layoffs with severance payments and who then sued
the company for refusing even to consider rehiring them. The
justices let stand the ruling of a federal appeals court in
New Orleans that the workers may sue for damages under state
law and aren't required to take their case to the National
Labor Relations Board.
   In still another case, the justices refused to settle an
important dispute over federal copyright law. A ruling by a
federal appeals court in New York severely limited authors'
use of unpublished letters, diaries, and other material. The
ruling sharply split that court's judges and brought cries of
protest from historians, authors and other researchers. But
the high court refused to hear the appeal by publisher Henry
Holt &amp; Co.
