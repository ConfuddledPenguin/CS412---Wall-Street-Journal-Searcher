   It was the late 1950s, it was the Wanchai district of Hong
Kong, and a Chinese bar girl was explaining to a tall,
puzzled American that she could not possibly be the nice girl
he'd met earlier in the day. "What a nice girl you met on
ferry doing in a place like this I like to know for goodness
sake," she tells him, ending with her favorite expression.
Her name, of course, was Suzie Wong, and the part would
launch an unknown 21-year-old named Nancy Kwan into stardom.
   Three decades after she first shimmied across the screen
and into William Holden's grudging heart, Ms. Kwan still
looks young enough to catch a sailor's eye -- a testament no
doubt to the Oriental Pearl Cream she now hawks on late-night
TV.

   Shortly after "The World of Suzie Wong," she put her Royal
Ballet training to good use as the scheming nightclub
performer Linda Low in Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Flower Drum
Song." Like the good-hearted Suzie, Linda was somewhat
pre-Betty Friedan in her outlook ("It's nice to have outside
accomplishments . . . but the main thing is for a woman to be
successful in her gender"); she sings the film's big song, "I
Enjoy Being a Girl."
   Ms. Kwan has gone on to prove herself decidedly more
diverse, having branched out into producing and writing in
addition to acting. But she too enjoys what life's given her
and thus has little time for modern complaints that the
cheongsam she wore as Suzie Wong -- the traditional
tightfitting, high-collared, Chinese slit sheath -- was
exploitative.
   "I still think it's very feminine," she says, conceding,
however, that "if you don't have the right figure, it
accentuates all the wrong places."
   Today home for Ms. Kwan is a modest ranch house tucked
away in Sherman Oaks, Calif., far removed from the hustle and
bustle of her native Hong Kong but filled with more Chinese
pieces than the emperor's palace. Toward "The World of Suzie
Wong" she exhibits a healthy indifference tinged with
appreciation for the opportunity. It was, she says, "just a
job," and indeed she tried out for the part on a lark only
after director Ray Stark spied her hanging around her uncle's
film studio during a school holiday from Britain. Of co-star
William Holden, she has only praise for an actor who was
"exceptionally generous" with others. "He was a man's man and
a woman's man if you know what I mean," she says. Her
Cantonese upbringing compels her to add that he "was a good
businessman, too."
   For though born of an English mother and now carrying an
American passport, Ms. Kwan was raised a daughter of the
Celestial Kingdom. Her Chinese name is Kwan Ka Shen, from a
family that traces itself back to Kwan Kung, a general so
renowned for his uprightness that his red-faced visage adorns
many a police station and shop. She relates how, as a young
student, she had intended to join a demonstration against one
of the many British-run Hong Kong clubs that wouldn't allow
Chinese as members. Her father, a famous local architect,
asked her not to, and out of filial piety, she did what any
Chinese girl would have done. She obeyed.
   Not long after "The World of Suzie Wong" made her a star
she left Hong Kong for work reasons but returned in the 1970s
to start up a production company called Nancy Kwan Films. In
the interim she's also kept up her acting career, appearing
in everything from the pilot for the old TV series "Hawaii
Five-O" to "Miracle Landing," the recent CBS docudrama about
the 1988 Aloha Airlines flight that survived losing its roof
in midair.
   It's been three years now since Ms. Kwan's visited Hong
Kong, but she eagerly quizzes a former resident about
prospects come the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from London
to Beijing. Like most Chinese, she is glad to see the end of
colonial rule; like most Hong Kong Chinese, she has her
worries. "I am Chinese and Hong Kong people are Chinese," she
says, fingering a jade bracelet. "Nevertheless, I wouldn't
like to see its special identity swallowed up by China."
   These days, however, her ethnic pride takes the
characteristically American form of volunteer work for such
organizations as the Association of Asian Pacific American
Artists. Things have changed considerably since the days when
Caucasians played Charlie Chan, but the organization remains
concerned about the public image of Asians. She also works on
behalf of the Vietnamese boat people, as well as heading up
public liaison for the Asian American Voters Coalition.
Although Asian Americans treasure the freedoms that have
enabled them to prosper in their new home, Ms. Kwan notes
that they have been reluctant to get involved in politics
because they by and large come from "police states where
politics get you in trouble." She reports proudly that the
White House requested a copy of her speech to an October AAVC
conference in Washington.
   For similar reasons she also is pleased about her upcoming
part in Frank Vinh Noan's "Endless Love." The story revolves
around an American separated from her Vietnamese husband and
infant daughter by the fall of Saigon, and Ms. Kwan plays the
Chinese-Vietnamese U.N. official fighting to bring them back
together. In the process she falls in love with a well-known
anti-war reporter now feeling some guilt pangs about the
consequences of the American defeat there. What makes this
film different from the dozens of others about Vietnam is
that this is the first seen through the eyes of a Vietnamese.
In addition to landing one of the lead roles, Ms. Kwan will
be co-producing the project, to be shot this summer, probably
in Thailand.
   Too soon the interview winds down, and it comes time to
ask for an autograph. Admitting to some wariness about the
press ("words never seem to turn out the way I said them"),
she nonetheless takes pen in hand and bends over a photo, a
formal portrait of her grandfather dressed in his imperial
robes. "A word is worth a thousand pictures," she writes, and
a reporter suggests that while flattering it's probably
untrue. The observation draws a mischevious smile. "Of course
it's not true," she says.
   For goodness sake.
