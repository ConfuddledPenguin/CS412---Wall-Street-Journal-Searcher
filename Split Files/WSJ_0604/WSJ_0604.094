   LONDON -- Mecca Leisure Group PLC soon may pay the
ultimate price for a 1988 takeover gamble.
   Financially weakened by debt from that acquisition, Mecca
is the target of a hostile #512 million ($859.4 million)
offer from rival British entertainment giant Rank
Organisationrank PLC.

   Rank said it would offer 90.9 pence ($1.53) of new Rank
ordinary shares for each ordinary Mecca share. The
bingo-parlor and entertainment concern swiftly rejected
Rank's offer, saying it "has excellent long-term prospects as
an independent operator" and that Rank's offer undervalues
the company.
   Mecca's shares, however, traded Friday at just 87.5 pence
on London's stock exchange, up 3.5 pence from Thursday but
still below Rank's offer price. And before rumors of a
possible bid began circulating in early May, Mecca shares
were trading at just 58 pence.
   Two years ago, Mecca paid about #700 million for
Pleasurama PLC, a much larger casino and leisure concern and
owner of the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain. Mecca, which
also operates vacation parks and nightclubs, since has
struggled to integrate the Pleasurama operations and weather
a decline in U.K. consumer spending. Debt taken to finance
the acquisition has hurt its earnings.
   Analysts say Mecca's days of independence may be numbered.
"I really don't see what they can pull out of the bag," said
Julie Feaver, an analyst at British brokerage County NatWest
WoodMac. "There's nothing they can really say" to keep
shareholders' loyalty, she said, and a friendly counterbid is
unlikely.
   Mecca could win a reprieve if the U.K. government decides
to launch a monopoly investigation. Such an inquiry appears
likely, as Mecca and Rank together would own 20% of Britain's
bingo parlors and would account for 30% of the spending in
them, Ms. Feaver said. But the government is likely to
approve the deal eventually, she said, as long as Rank agrees
to sell some bingo halls.
   Rank, which is much larger than Mecca, had pretax profit
of #291.1 million on sales of #1.09 billion in the year ended
Oct. 31. Rank's interests include trailer parks, leisure
centers, a 50% stake in the Rank Xerox copy-machine maker and
film and television services. Mecca had 1989 pretax profit of
#91.1 million on sales of #588.4 million. Analysts estimate
Mecca's debt at #460 million. In January, the company said it
would try to reduce debt by raising #250 million through
asset sales.
   Rank said there would be "extensive benefits" in combining
the two companies, citing potential savings on marketing and
operations. Rank's shares tumbled after Friday's announcement
to 803 pence, down 15. Analysts attributed the drop to the
prospective issue of new stock. Rumors of a possible Rank bid
for Mecca had sparked concern that Rank might pay too much,
but "at this price, {the offer} seems sensible," said Max
Dolding, an analyst at James Capel &amp; Co. here.
