   MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Mediagenic said it agreed to a
long-term payment of the $6.6 million in patent infringement
court damages that, as previously reported, a federal court
awarded earlier this year to Philips Consumer Electronics
Company, a unit of North American Philips Corp.
   Under the agreement, the entertainment software company
will pay Philips monthly installments of $150,000 from July
1990 to Dec. 1993, with a balloon payment at Dec. 31, 1993.

   The suit was originally brought by the Magnavox Company
(now Philips) against Activision (now Mediagenic). The patent
at issue expired in 1989.
