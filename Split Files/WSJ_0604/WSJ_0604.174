   ARGONNE, Ill. -- The Department of Energy's Argonne
National Laboratory is scheduled to break ground today for
the $456 million Advanced Photon Source, a device that will
generate X-ray beams 10,000 times brighter than those from
any existing source.
   The new-generation synchrotron, an aluminum circle
two-thirds of a mile in length, will succeed DOE's Brookhaven
National Laboratory on Long Island as the world's most
powerful X-ray source.

   Synchrotrons, originally developed for particle research,
produce powerful X-rays as a by-product of accelerating
electrons through magnetic fields. Scientists can use such
rays to determine the precise positions of atoms in chemical
reactions.
   The Argonne device will produce X-rays with higher
energies: There are "more photons, or light particles, in the
beam so you get data faster," said a lab spokesman.
Scientists will be able to "do experiments at APS in a few
hours that would require months at Brookhaven," he added.
   Experiments at the Argonne lab aren't scheduled to get
under way until 1996, however, by which time a slightly less
powerful machine now under construction in Europe will be
operational, and another device in Japan will also be
starting up.
   Argonne is operated by the University of Chicago for the
DOE.
   The lab says the APS will be "fundamentally for basic
research." The spokesman, however, stressed that it is
"research that's expected to produce lots of practical
results," in fields such as computer science, ceramics,
chemistry and physics.
   Argonne said scientists from companies including
Allied-Signal Inc., Exxon Corp., International Business
Machines Corp., and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories have helped plan and design the facility, and
have indicated interest in using the facility when it's
completed.
