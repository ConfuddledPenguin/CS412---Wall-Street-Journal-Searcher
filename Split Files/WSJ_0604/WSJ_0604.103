   Lawson Mardon Group Ltd., Toronto, said its European
folding carton division acquired two West German carton
manufacturing operations in a transaction valued at about
16.5 million Canadian dollars (US$14.1 million).
   Both companies, W. Cordes and Hanse Druck, produce cartons
for the tobacco, confectionary and cosmetics industry in
Europe, said Lawson Mardon, a packaging and printing concern.
