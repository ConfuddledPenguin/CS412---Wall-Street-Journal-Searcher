   In 2000, there will be 81.6 million baby boomers between
the ages of 35 and 55. But there will only be 56.1 million
people between 20 and 35 for them to manage. One result: In
2010, the typical large business will have half as many
management levels and one-third as many managerial positions
as it does today.

   What Paperless Office?
                                                                                                       

   Computers will definitely eliminate some paper. But there
will be plenty left. By 2000, U.S. businesses will still need
a space equivalent to all of the office space in Pittsburgh
to file the 120 billion sheets of new paper they will
generate every year.

   Talk, Talk, Talk
                                                                                                       

   Despite fax machines and electronic mail, businesses will
still be addicted to the telephone. One prediction:
Businesses will double their use of long-distance telephone
service by 2000.

   Milk Break
                                                                                                       

   To keep new mothers working in the office, more companies
will be offering breast-feeding breaks as part of their
package of benefits.

   Ballot Boss
                                                                                                       

   Companies, concerned about declining morale and
productivity, may allow employees to select supervisors by
vote.

   Pencils Down
                                                                                                       

   Drug testing will proliferate in the workplace -- but it
will be less invasive. Within 20 years, most companies will
give workers periodic performance-based tests -- gauging such
things as short-term memory or object recognition -- to see
whether they are impaired by drugs.

   Cleaning Up
                                                                                                       

   Between now and 2000, about 556,000 janitorial and
maid-service jobs will be created. That's more than the
combined new jobs for computer programmers, accountants and
auditors.

   Just Relax
                                                                                                       

   Employers will increasingly provide mental-health days to
give workers some relief from job stress.
