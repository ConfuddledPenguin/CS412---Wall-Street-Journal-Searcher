   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Televideo Systems Inc. said it has
signed two joint-venture agreements to market the company's
computer systems in the Soviet Union.
   The agreement, which also involves West Germany's ABM
Computer Systems, will provide computers to the city of
Moscow and the Ministry of Construction. The companies will
offer computers and computer parts for resale through a
computer store chain in Moscow that will be set up as part of
the venture. Terms weren't disclosed.

   Televideo said it doesn't expect the venture to be
profitable for about two years. Initially, it expects to
provide 1,000 to 2,000 systems a month.
   As part of the agreement, Moscow is providing land near
the Kremlin that the joint-venture parties will develop into
a hotel and office complex for western visitors and a source
of hard currency earnings.
