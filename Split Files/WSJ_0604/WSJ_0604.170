   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NCNB Corp. acquired most of the
remnants of the failed National Bancshares Corp. of Texas,
based in San Antonio, increasing its stake in the state by
purchasing $1 billion in assets and assuming $1.5 billion in
liabilities.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved NCNB's
proposal to assume the deposits and secured liabilities of
nine of the 12 bank subsidiaries of National Bancshares. The
banks are expected to reopen today as units of NCNB Texas
National Banking Corp.

   Since its entry into Texas in 1988, the ever-aggressive
NCNB has grown to be the largest bank in the state by picking
up sundry pieces from the Texas banking disaster. With this
acquisition, NCNB Texas will have $31.4 billion in assets and
250 branches in 77 communities.
   In a statement, Kenneth D. Lewis, president of NCNB Texas,
called the transaction "a major step in NCNB's expansion
strategy and an excellent addition to our trust business." He
said it doubles the number of locations in San Antonio, which
NCNB considers an attractive market, and gives NCNB a
presence in seven new communities. The FDIC said the nine
bank units are based in Austin, Boerne, Corpus Christi,
Houston, Kerrville, Mission, San Antonio, Sequin and Uvalde.
   Under terms of the transaction, the FDIC will infuse
$581.2 million into the assuming bank and will retain assets
of the failed banks with a book value of $613.7 million, the
agency said. NCNB agreed to pay a premium of $59.5 million
for the $1.5 billion in deposits it is assuming.
   Until the end of April, it appeared that National
Bancshares would be acquired by Equimark Corp., the
Pittsburgh bank holding company. Under a recapitalization
plan drafted in mid-1989, Equimark agreed to invest or raise
about $116 million of new capital for National Bancshares. At
the same time, the FDIC was expected to invest about $250
million to eliminate the negative net worth -- assets minus
liabilities -- of subsidiary banks and cover losses from
problem assets.
   In late April, however, the FDIC unexpectedly scuttled the
plan rather than bow to bondholders' demands that it sweeten
its offer. Some banking industry observers also speculated
that the recapitalization failure owed as much to Equimark's
problems at home as it did to recalcitrant bondholders.
Buffeted by the weak commercial real-estate market, Equimark
had a $15.4 million loss in the first quarter.
