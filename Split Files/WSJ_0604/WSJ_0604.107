   Affiliated Publications Inc., publisher of the Boston
Globe and a stable of trade magazines, said it has agreed to
acquire 80% of A/S/M Communications Inc., publisher of Adweek
magazine.
   The purchase price was not disclosed, but industry
executives familiar with the transaction estimated the
Boston-based Affiliated paid about $17 million for the stake
to a group of private holders. Kenneth Fadner, president of
A/S/M, is the largest holder; he will continue in his post
and retain a substantial portion of the remaining 20%.

   Adweek, started in 1978, has been battered by a decline in
advertising by media companies. A/S/M, attempting to ease
financial difficulties, had quietly folded seven publications
in recent months, and had been seeking an outside investor to
provide cash.
   Affiliated is acquiring Adweek, Adweek's Marketing Week,
and Photo District News. All of the A/S/M titles will become
part of BPI Communications Inc, Affiliated's specialty
publishing subsidiary.
   Adweek will be a strategic addition to BPI
Communications's growing group of media and
entertainment-related magazines. BPI also publishes The
Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Back Stage, American Film,
Photo Design and Interiors.
