   BRUSSELS -- Belgian glass maker Glaverbel said it raised
its stake in U.S. flat-glass producer AFG Industries Inc. to
26.6% from 19.7%.
   Glaverbel owns all the preferred shares of AFG, which it
acquired as part of a management buy-out of the U.S. concern
in 1988. It has said it wants to acquire a controlling stake.
