   This is an interesting time of year in TV-land, a time
when armchair executives get to examine -- and scoff at --
the choices the networks have made for the fall season.
Although there weren't any shocking errors this year, like a
cancellation of "Twin Peaks," the lesson of "Peaks" has yet
to be understood. Programmers still don't quite believe that
they can, that they must, dare to be experimental, even
wacky. (Perhaps the lone exception is ABC's "Cop Rock," half
police story, half opera.)
   In the meantime, two fine hour-long dramas, "Equal
Justice" (ABC) and "Shannon's Deal" (NBC), have not made the
fall schedule. "Justice" (still airing Wednesdays at 10 p.m.
EDT) is the other side of "L.A. Law," the prosecutors' side.
Set in a big-city D.A.'s office, the show has "Law's" large
cast and revolving story lines, but a much grittier flavor
(more like "Hill Street Blues").

   Co-created by its executive producer, Thomas Carter,
"Justice" may lack "L.A. Law's" sense of oddball fun, but the
subject it portrays is grimmer. These are not high-gloss,
high-roller clients, but junkies, muggers and cheap rip-off
artists -- the everyday dross of a legal system that's so
overburdened it creaks. "It's a revolving toilet," says one
character. "Flush 'em down, they come right back up."
   If "Equal Justice" is harsh, it's certainly more in touch
with reality than most shows on TV. "Justice" is unafraid to
kill off the girlfriend of a main character in an early
episode, unafraid to feature a junkie struggling with
addiction. The characters are richly, fully drawn -- young
assistant district attorneys who signed on for idealistic
reasons but now are stuck trudging through the garbage: "One
day I was studying the Constitution, the next I was
prosecuting rapists."
   This is a world of compromises, a world in which the ends
are always justifying the means. All sorts of dubious deals
are struck as the ADAs fight to put people away, and climb
over each other on the way to the top: "We all gotta crawl
sometimes," says one. "It toughens the knees." In the
black-and-white world of television, "Justice" is a study in
gray.
   "Shannon's Deal" (reruns may air this summer) is perhaps a
step closer to run-of-the-mill TV fare -- a down-and-out
lawyer takes on various cases that come his way. But, as
created by John Sayles, this series stands out because of
top-grade writing. Shannon is a reformed gambler; his "deal"
is that he's lost his money, his high-paying corporate job,
and his wife. He's starting over with a wonderful secretary
he can't afford to pay, and cheesy clients who say things
like, "He made a move on me and I greased him." "I wouldn't
say `greased' in court," says Shannon. "It doesn't convey
your deep sense of remorse over the tragic incident."
   One especially well-crafted installment was "Words to
Music," guest-starring the real-life singers Iggy Pop, Tanya
Tucker and David Crosby. A young country songwriter's lyrics
get stolen, and Shannon plunges headlong into the world of
music. The writers have a blast, taking swipes at everything
from punk rock (a ballad called "Search and Destroy") to
country ("the only kind of music where trucks and trucking
play a major role").
   Both "Shannon's Deal" and "Equal Justice" display the kind
of intelligence infrequently seen on TV. And both are being
relegated to backup status, only to be resuscitated if other
shows falter.
   What are these other shows? What are the exciting series
that will air instead? We'll only be able to see them in the
fall, but here's a cross-section of what lies ahead from the
three networks, as described in their own press releases.
Remember, these shows were approved by real network
executives:
   "`America's Funniest ... Part II,' in which the producers
of the original hit series go out to capture the rest of
what's funny about America."
   "`Married People,' about three generations of couples --
newlyweds, baby boomers and `longweds' -- who share a New
York brownstone and learn a lot about love and marriage from
each other."
   "`Baby Talk,' based on the hit movie `Look Who's Talking'
and starring Connie Selleca as a young, single mother
determined to raise her baby son while trying to find him a
perfect father. The baby's thoughts are expressed through the
voice of Tony Danza."
   "`Going Places,' {which} tells of four talented and
energetic young people who move to Los Angeles to work on
their first TV show."
   "`Hull Street High': This musical comedy follows the
unpredictable events at Cordell Hull Street High School. . .
. Music lurks around every corner and there's no telling what
pandemonium might break loose."
   "`Four Alarm Family' . . . a half-hour comedy about a
widower who finds raising his kids a full-time job.
   "Unfortunately, he's already got one . . . as captain of
the local firehouse. And that's a good thing, because with
four kids, it's always a four-alarmer at his house."
   "`The Hogan Family' . . . a family that thrives on the
love, support and humor that comes from being together."
   "`The Hammersmiths' is a comedic and poignant one-hour
drama {about} a large, boisterous family who share a great
sense of humor and an ability to snap back from life's
tragedies. But that aside, they're as different as can be,
with ongoing clashes of style, interests, attitudes and
priorities which only their deep love for each other can
overcome."
   "`The Green Machine' . . . is a one-hour drama about a
diverse group of top-notch professionals who have been
specially selected to fight against threats to the world's
ecological balance."
   No wonder "Equal Justice" and "Shannon's Deal" didn't
stand a chance.
