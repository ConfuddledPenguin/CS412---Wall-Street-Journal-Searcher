   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to eliminate an
export declaration form for most Canadian goods bound for the
U.S.
   The decision will benefit more than 15,000 Canadian
exporters, by eliminating the need for more than 200,000
documents each month, the government said.

<TEXT>
   The move was made possible by a U.S.-Canada agreement,
whereby each country will use the other's import statistics
to produce its export figures.
   The U.S. and Canada have more bilateral trade than any
other pair of countries. Their merchandise trade in the first
three months of this year totaled US$42 billion.
