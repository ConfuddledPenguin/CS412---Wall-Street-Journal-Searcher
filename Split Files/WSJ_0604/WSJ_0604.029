   As a former journalist who covered the semiconductor area
of the electronics industry, I especially appreciated your
May 4 page-one feature "Partnership in Peril" about John
Hall's experiences with Japanese businessmen.
   In the late 1960s a strong consensus concluded that the
Japanese semiconductor capabilities were so comparatively
crude that their best hopes for catch-up (technological
parity and commercial success) rested on acquisition or
theft. After Mr. Hall, the Japanese suddenly possessed strong
capabilities.

<TEXT>
   We underestimated Japan's determination in chips, cars,
consumer appliances and more. Many of us knew the danger of
Soviet political infiltration, but did not see Japan's
economic infiltration.
   We have no evidence that the Japanese have any sense of
business integrity that extends to the rest of the world,
that their "word" in deals or agreements is credible, or that
they practice free enterprise as a two-way street.
   I fear that the opening of Japan's markets will be even
narrower than the opening of Russia's and that we will have
to wake up to the serious risks from a Japan that cannot be
trusted, that is supremist and economically imperialistic.
