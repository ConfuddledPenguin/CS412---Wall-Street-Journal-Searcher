   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and
BanPonce Corp. said the commissioner of financial
institutions of Puerto Rico issued conditional approval of
the two institutions' proposed merger.
   The banks -- Puerto Rico's two largest -- said they filed
a motion for reconsideration with the commissioner, because
the approval contains restrictions they consider "highly
burdensome."

   A Banco Popular spokesman said the major conditions
imposed on the merger include an 18-month period of oversight
by the commissioner's office; no charges for transactions at
automatic teller machines; no increases in interest rates and
finance charges on loans to small companies with $500,000 or
less in debt; and a requirement that two-thirds of local
deposits be used to finance local loans.
   Banco Popular and BanPonce have agreed to the merger in a
transaction valued at $324 million. Under their agreement,
which has been approved by stockholders of both companies,
BanPonce holders will be able to exchange each of their
shares either for shares in the new entity or for cash. In
each case, the exchange is valued at $56.25 a share.
