   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., a
hotel-casino company, reported net income for its first
quarter ended April 30 rose 1.1% to $19.2 million, or 70
cents a share, from $19 million, or 64 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Average shares outstanding in the latest quarter declined
to 27.5 million from 29.9 million a year earlier.

   Revenue climbed 4.6% to $133.3 million from $127.5
million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Circus Circus shares fell $1.625, to close at $61.125.
   The company said operating results at its Circus
Circus-Reno location in Nevada "rose markedly" from the
year-earlier period, when performance was soft because of bad
weather. The company's two properties in Laughlin, Nev., also
posted increases in operating results.
   But the company's three Las Vegas properties had
"moderately lower" results in the quarter, reflecting a drop
of "several percentage points" in casino revenue, the company
said. Walk-in traffic at Circus Circus-Las Vegas was hurt by
competition from Golden Nugget Inc.'s new Mirage resort on
the Las Vegas Strip, Circus Circus said.
