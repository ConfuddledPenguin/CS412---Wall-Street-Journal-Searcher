   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- For book lovers -- those who prefer
bookstores that sell more books than video games and party
favors -- there is good news from the American Booksellers
Association's annual convention.
   Bookstore owners attending the convention, which runs
through tomorrow, say the overriding trend in bookstores
today is bigger stores that carry a broad selection of
titles, including previous titles by authors and books by
emerging writers.

   "The trend is breadth: The public is interested in
everything," says Edward A. Morrow Jr., president of the
American Booksellers and owner of the Northshire Bookstore in
Manchester Center, Vt. Mr. Morrow says that the vast
expansion in bookstores in the 1980s, coupled with the
demographic growth of book-buying, well-educated yuppies, has
led to an increase in book sales in many areas, from computer
and self-help books to literary fiction.
   Mr. Morrow says that he added non-book items to his own
stock in years past "for defensive reasons, because margins
were better. But now, it's so important to have depth to be
competitive that we're looking to cut back in stationery and
maybe games, so we'll have more room for books."
   Not only are independent bookstore owners re-emphasizing a
broad, thoughtful selection of books, but the big bookstore
chains are also adding titles. The two biggest chains, B.
Dalton, a unit of closely held BDB Inc., and the Waldenbooks
unit of K mart Corp., are adding titles in their mall stores
and expanding smaller chains, such as Brentano's, which is
owned by Waldenbooks, that have more books, a classy image
and lots of service.
   The most extreme shift is that of Crown Books Corp., a
discount chain based in Landover, Md., which has grown to 260
stores by selling a limited selection of mostly best sellers
for discounts as high as 40%.
   Crown is just starting to build a series of Super Crown
stores, which have three times as many titles as the old
stores, or about 30,000, says President Robert Haft. Two
Super Crown stores that opened within the past three weeks
near Washington offer discounts even on specially ordered
books. The ambiance of the stores, with piped in classical
music and benches that encourage browsing, isn't what Crown
is known for.
   Mr. Haft, who says people tend to spend about one-third
more money at the new, bigger stores, says: "We just listened
to our customers. They said they loved our prices but there
were more books they wanted to read. I think it's a trend
reflected in all kinds of retailing. People don't just want
low prices, but also service and selection." Mr. Haft says he
has signed leases for four more Super Crown bookstores, and
if they do well, more will follow.
   Among the hundreds of exhibitors' booths here, there are
plenty of non-book products vying for booksellers'
attentions. There are half a dozen booths offering fancy
bookmarks alone, plus others selling videotapes, games,
stuffed animals, rubber stamps, post cards and
answering-machine audiotapes featuring impersonations of
movie stars. There is even a patented invention by housewife
Patty Sremba of Anaheim Hills, Calif., called a Sunbuddy, a
little paper device retailing for $1.99 that pops up to shade
a paperback book from the sun.
   Even while the staffs of New York publishing houses moan
about the tackiness of Vegas, there seems to be a consensus
among the bookish crowd that this ABA convention has been
more respectful about books than some in years past. "It
seems like there was more frivolity at earlier conventions;
lots of fitness celebrities and people dressed as cartoon
characters," says novelist Mark Childress. "This year, it
seems like everybody is running around trying to get galleys
{uncorrected, pre-publication copies of books} before they
run out. The focus is on the books."

   Proof of the mass popularity of bookstores comes from a
new national poll, released by the ABA at the convention.
   Bernard Rath, executive director of the Booksellers
Association, says that 93 million Americans visit a bookstore
at least once a month, according to a national telephone
survey conducted by Wirthlin Group. Of those who visit a
bookstore at least once a month, says Mr. Rath, about 54% are
women; and 62% of the visitors are between the ages of 18 and
44. New England and the Pacific region stand out for their
share of bookstore traffic.
   Since the ABA hasn't conducted such a survey before, it
isn't clear whether people are visiting bookstores more or
less often than in the past, but bookstore sales have been
climbing rapidly, says Mr. Rath. A recent ABA/Commerce
Department report showed an increase in retail bookstore
sales to $5.1 billion in 1987, from $3.1 billion in 1982.
Sales are expected to reach $7.2 billion in 1990. st

   Amid the optimism, Mr. Rath, the ABA executive director,
sees several discouraging trends. The survey on bookstore
visits showed that only half the 93 million Americans that
enter a bookstore monthly actually buy a book. Mr. Rath
believes that publishers and booksellers have to band
together to aggressively promote reading.
   One possible tool for promoting books and reading is a new
weekly television series, "First Edition," conceived by a
group of public television producers. At a meeting in the
convention center Saturday, Mr. Rath presented the idea to a
small group of influential bookstore owners, hoping to get
them to help commit some funding that could then be added to
anticipated corporate and foundation support.
   The new show would be produced by KQED, a public
television station in San Francisco. The producers emphasize
that this wouldn't be another talking-heads show with
professorial writers blathering on. Marjorie Poore, vice
president for national production at KQED, says the show is
modeled more on the syndicated "Entertainment Tonight" than
news shows on public television. It would feature visits to
authors at their homes; reports on industry trends, gossip
and best sellers and reviews, says Ms. Poore.
   Booksellers and publishing executives in the room wondered
if publishers would have enough money in their promotional
budgets for such a venture. Even if funding is found, Ms.
Poore says, "First Edition" probably won't get on the air
before fall of 1991.

   There is little doubt among convention-goers about what
will be THE big book this fall: "The Plains of Passage" by
Jean Auel.
   It certainly isn't because Ms. Auel's publisher, the Crown
Publishing unit of Random House, threw a party for 1,000
people on Saturday night, complete with wild-animal sounds
and a ballroom-sized copy of the book's cover. (Actually, it
wasn't the cover but a movie backdrop from the film "The Old
Gringo.") This is Ms. Auel's fourth book in a series about a
couple living in the Ice Age that started with "Clan of the
Cave Bear" in 1979. Her last offering, "The Mammoth Hunters"
came out five years ago, and her fans have been eagerly
awaiting the next book.
   Tom Simon, a Waldenbooks vice president, says "People have
been asking for this book for years. Thousands of people have
called Waldenbooks to reserve a copy of this, and it won't be
out for months."
   In general, booksellers take for granted that new novels
by all the big guns, such as John Updike ("Rabbit at Rest" is
out this fall from Knopf) and Jackie Collins will
automatically be published in huge quantities, heavily
advertised and sought out by fans. Thus, they are pretty sure
to be best sellers. Betting gets much trickier when it comes
to books, however promising, by little-known authors.
   But one author who may make the leap to bestsellerdom this
year is Mr. Childress, whose third novel, "Tender," is
getting special treatment from Harmony, a unit of Random
House's Crown Publishing. Bruce Harris, an executive vice
president of Random House, says the novel, about an Elvis
Presley-like rock star, "just got everybody excited at Crown
when they read it." When a copy was sent to Stephen King, the
bestselling author contributed a blurb calling the book "the
best rock 'n' roll novel I ever read."
   Mr. Harris decided to promote the book heavily, including
a 15-city author tour this fall, plus a party at the ABA
convention. Trying to create a buzz about the book among
booksellers, "Tender" is the only book he's handing out in
galleys this year. Mr. Harris recalls that a decade ago, he
handed out galleys at the ABA convention of "Clan of the Cave
Bear;" he hopes "Tender" will be a "surprise" best seller,
too.
