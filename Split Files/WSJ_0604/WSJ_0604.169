   LA JOLLA, Calif. -- Intermark Inc.'s fiscal fourth-quarter
loss widened to $14 million, or $1.54 a share, from $7.2
million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue in the period ended March 31 rose 69% to $277.7
million from $164.7 million, mainly reflecting the
consolidation of Intermark's results with those of Triton
Group Ltd. Intermark owns 52% of Triton's stock, and the two
firms recently agreed to merge, pending various approvals.

   Intermark had operating profit, before interest expense,
minority interest and taxes, of $4.7 million. A year earlier,
it posted a $14.6 million operating loss, including a $16
million provision for store closings at its Sunbelt Nursery
Group Inc. unit.
   Intermark said interest expense climbed to $14.1 million,
including $6.4 million from Triton, compared with $8.2
million a year earlier. The quarter also included a $4.3
million loss attributable to Munson Sporting Goods Co.
Intermark sold its stake in the wholesale sporting goods
distributor in February.
   For the year, Intermark posted a net loss of $10.7
million, or $1.20 a share, compared with net income of
$215,000, or one cent a share, in fiscal 1989. Revenue grew
39% to $945.5 million from $681.9 million. Operating profit
rose 21% to $47.3 million from $39.1 million.
   Intermark and Triton holds interests in numerous operating
companies in retailing, restaurants, real estate and other
industries. Intermark said the strongest operating
performances in fiscal 1990 were from Sunbelt Nursery, which
contributed $10 million of profit in contrast to a $22
million loss the year before, and from Pier 1 Imports Inc.,
whose contribution jumped by 12% to $48 million.
   "While the fiscal year 1990 loss is disappointing, we feel
good about the progress made by our partner companies during
the year and about the general health of our business," said
Charles R. Scott, Intermark chairman and chief executive
officer. "The growth in operating income during 1990 is a
clear indication of the strength of our companies."
