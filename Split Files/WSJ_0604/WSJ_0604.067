   Ire Over Allergy Drug Ads
   Is Nothing to Sneeze At

   THE COMPETITION is having a severe reaction to a new
marketing ploy for a popular allergy remedy.
   Warner-Lambert Co. is fuming over a new public-service TV
ad campaign co-sponsored indirectly by archrival Marion
Merrell Dow Inc. The ads dramatize the possible danger of
driving under the influence of over-the-counter
antihistamines, some of which cause drowsiness. The ads make
a none-too-veiled comparison to drunken driving.
   For Marion Merrell, the payoff is obvious: Its Seldane
prescription drug, touted as a non-sedating allergy medicine,
awaits Food and Drug Administration approval to become an OTC
drug.
   Marion Merrell formed a group called the Allergy Council
of America that is the official co-sponsor of the campaign,
along with the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. The company says the federal agency knew it
was involved. The ads don't mention Seldane.
   But Warner-Lambert sees the campaign as a direct attack on
OTC medications like its Benadryl product, which causes
drowsiness in some consumers.
   "This is a scare tactic," says Cathy Segal, senior
products manager at Warner-Lambert. "Consumers recognize and
read labels and understand that products have certain side
effects." Warner-Lambert also charges that Marion Merrell's
public-relations firm planted articles bad-mouthing such OTC
antihistamines in consumer and trade magazines.
   Marion Merrell says it hired the PR firm "to help raise
awareness of the fact that people should read labels and
follow the instructions on packaging."
   Still, the spokesman doesn't dispute that the campaign is
running concurrently with print advertisements touting
prescription Seldane. "There may be some indirect connection
made in consumers' minds between the two ads," he concedes.

   Soccer Sponsorships
   In U.S. Need a Kick
                                                                                                       

   THE U.S. TEAM will play in the finals of the World Cup
soccer championship this year for the first time since 1950
-- but only three companies have signed up to cheer them on
with sponsorships.
   The U.S. Soccer Federation, which directs activities of
the U.S. team, says it isn't disappointed with the paltry
showing of support. With the 1994 World Cup to be held in the
U.S., the group says corporate interest in soccer should
balloon in coming years.
   Sports-marketing specialists aren't so sure. "Soccer by
now should have taken off. . . . It's had every opportunity,"
says David Burns, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service
in Chicago, which helps clients find athletes to endorse
their products. "But it's at a standstill, and I don't see
any encouragement."
   As a spectator sport, soccer hasn't attracted many U.S.
fans. The North American Soccer League collapsed in 1985. The
Major Indoor Soccer League still exists, but only six teams
play in the league. This year's World Cup, which will be
played in Italy, begins June 8.
   Federation executives point to the big audience soccer can
reach. For example, last December's draw of World Cup
match-ups attracted a world-wide TV audience of more than 600
million, the federation says. (The draw was seen in the U.S.
in limited markets on a cable network.)
   The corporations signed up as sponsors -- Anheuser-Busch
Cos., Chiquita Brands Inc. and Adidas USA, which paid a total
of about $1 million among them -- aren't concerned that
soccer isn't a big hit in the U.S. "Soccer still has a long
way to go," admits Ken Chartier, national manager of
promotions at Adidas, a unit of Adidas Germany. "But we're
interested in staying with it."
                                                                                                       

   Pitches on Value Stick
   In Consumers' Minds
                                                                                                       

   AD CAMPAIGNS promising low prices and value catapulted
three major retailers into the top 10 for print campaigns of
1989, according to a new survey of consumers by Video
Storyboard Tests Inc.
   Calvin Klein Industries Inc.'s sensual ads promoting its
fragrances and underwear, among other things, again took top
honors as the most outstanding print campaign. But consumers
polled by the ad-tracking firm put a high price on value
advertising by naming as their favorites the campaigns of
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., K mart Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. The
three made the top 10 for the first time.
   Many of those retailers' campaigns featured ads promoting
products with prices specified. J.C. Penney, for example,
featured Stafford men's suits with their price tags. Sears
ran ads with the theme "Your money's worth and a whole lot
more."
   Other campaigns making the top 10 included ads for Camel
cigarettes, Nike, Marlboro, Ford, Estee Lauder and Revlon.
   Many other campaigns that ranked in the top 50 also tapped
the value theme. Auto ads with cash-back offers, airline ads
for low fares and cosmetics ads with free samples were named
by many of the 24,000 consumers polled.
   "Value" was the most compelling reason consumers recalled
ads in 1989, says Dave Vadehra of Video Storyboard.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   GOING UPSCALE: Parker Pen USA, known mainly for its
inexpensive gift-set pens, this month will introduce a line
of luxury pens costing up to $325. . . . Wheeler Inc., which
uses pickup trucks to display larger-than-life versions of
such products as Absolut vodka, is expanding from its New
York base. Trucks recently started rolling in Boston, Los
Angeles and San Francisco, and later this year will hit
Chicago and Miami.
