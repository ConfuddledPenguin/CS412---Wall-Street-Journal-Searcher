   NEW YORK -- Borden Inc. said it will restructure its food
businesses in Japan over the next 18 months, moving toward
full ownership and control of its product lines.
   The producer of food, packaging and consumer and
industrial products said it makes and distributes Borden
brand ice cream, cheese and margarine in Japan. The company
until now has licensed Borden's margarine and ice cream to
Meiji Milk Products, a Japanese company. Borden also had a
joint venture manufacturing operation for cheese, which was
distributed by Meiji.
