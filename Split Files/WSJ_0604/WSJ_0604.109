   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- BioTechnica International Inc. said
its BioTechnica Agriculture unit received the first federal
approval to begin field-testing genetically engineered corn
plants.
   The company said the tests, approved by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, are scheduled to begin next week
near Lisbon, Iowa, at its cornbreeding station.

   BioTechnica disclosed that its corn plants have been
modified to contain "marker" genes that enable scientists to
track the inheritance of artificially introduced genes in
genetically engineered plants. In January, the company said
it was the first to incorporate foreign genes successfully in
corn plants. Corn is one of several major grain crops in
which inserting new genes has proved difficult. But
BioTechnica hadn't previously disclosed what kind of gene was
involved.
   A marker gene has little economic importance and is
inserted to enable scientists to determine whether foreign
genes have been incorporated and are inherited in a plant. A
typical marker gene would confer resistance to a certain
herbicide; plants incorporating it are identified by their
survival when exposed to the herbicide. BioTechnica declined
to identify the marker gene used. In April, DeKalb Genetics
Corp. and a joint USDA-Monsanto Co. team separately said they
also had inserted marker genes in corn.
   BioTechnica also disclosed that it is trying to engineer
corn genetically to produce high levels of the amino acid
lysine, a building block of protein.
   And the company said it is developing corn, soybean,
alfalfa and wheat plants that have been genetically altered
for improvements, such as increased insect resistance, yield
or nutrition.
