   Most North American newsprint producers pushed through a
scheduled price increase of slightly more than 5% Friday, the
first good news in two years for struggling newsprint makers.
But if labor negotiations in Eastern Canada are settled
without a strike, prices could slide back to pre-increase
levels, some industry executives and observers said.
   "It looks like {the increase} has a better chance of
sticking than it did two months ago," said Homer Taylor, vice
president, supply, at Knight-Ridder Inc. Mason Sizemore,
president of the Seattle Times, said five of his six
newsprint suppliers raised their prices, and, "As far as I
know, it's going through."

   Led by Toronto-based Abitibi-Price Inc., which said it
expects the price boost to hold, most North American
producers earlier this year announced the increase for June
1. Producers raised the benchmark Eastern U.S. list price of
standard newsprint 5.4%, or US$35 a metric ton, to $685 a
metric ton. A similar increase was announced in other
markets, where the pricing system is slightly different. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   Newsprint now is sold at about a 19% discount from list,
so the price increase raises transaction prices, or actual
selling prices, to about $555 a metric ton from about $525 in
the East.
   When the price increase was first announced, many
newsprint buyers said it had little chance of going into
effect. But the supply of newsprint has tightened in the past
several weeks, newsprint buyers said, as publishers built
inventory in anticipation of a possible strike at mills in
Eastern Canada. U.S. publishers buy more than half of their
newsprint from Canadian mills.
   Any strike would first hit Montreal-based Stone
Consolidated Inc., a unit of Stone Container Corp., Chicago.
The Canadian Paperworkers Union targeted certain Stone
Consolidated mills for negotiation of contracts that will
then set the pattern for settlements at other Eastern
Canadian mills. A Stone Consolidated spokeswoman said that
negotiations on contract language began last Thursday, and
that once those points are settled, discussion of salary
issues will start. The union is seeking wage increases of 8%
a year in each of two years.
   Canadian newsprint producers in particular are desperate
for a price increase. "The average Canadian company isn't
making money" at current prices, said Brian Topp, an analyst
at Capital Group Securities Ltd. in Toronto. Along with
facing higher labor costs, Canadian producers continue to be
hurt by the high level of the Canadian dollar, valued against
the U.S. dollar.
   Analysts said that, without a strike, producers will have
to curtail production to make the price increase stick. While
U.S. output has increased this year, Canadian mills have
already cut some production. Canadian newsprint output in the
first four months of this year dropped 2.6% from a year
earlier, according to the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association, an industry group. Canadian mills operated at
94% of capacity through the end of April, compared with 97% a
year earlier.
   Meanwhile, Canadian producers of market pulp continue to
make sharp cuts in production to keep prices for their major
premium grade pulp from falling. Canadian producers of market
pulp operated at just 77% of capacity in April, as production
fell 11% from a year earlier. For the first four months,
Canadian market pulp production fell 8% and shipments
declined 13%.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of newsprint and
of market pulp.
