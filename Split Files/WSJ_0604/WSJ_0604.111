   BOSTON -- Genzyme Corp., a biotechnology and
pharmaceutical concern, and the Amoco Biotechnology Co. unit
of Amoco Corp., Chicago, said the previously announced
agreement to sell their interests in their Gene-Trak Systems
joint venture to Hoechst Group AG of West Germany was
terminated without reaching terms.
   The companies said they now are free to negotiate with
"other interested parties"; none was identified. Gene-Trak is
developing tests for food-borne pathogens and infectious
diseases, using nucleic acid probe technology, the companies
said.
