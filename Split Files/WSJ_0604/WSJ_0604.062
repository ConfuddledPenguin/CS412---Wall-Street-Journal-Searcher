   MONTREAL -- Domtar Inc., as expected, named Jean Campeau
chairman and Pierre Desjardins president and chief executive
officer, succeeding James H. Smith, who held all three posts
and is retiring from the paper and building products concern.
   The appointment of Mr. Desjardins, 48-year-old president
of Labatt Breweries of Canada, Toronto, a unit of John Labatt
Ltd., is effective Sept. 1, when Mr. Smith, 58, will remain
chairman until Mr. Campeau's arrival Nov. 1.

   Mr. Campeau, also 58, is stepping down as chairman and
general manager of Caisse de Depot et Placement, the Quebec
government's pension-fund agency. Mr. Campeau (who isn't
related to the Toronto businessman Robert Campeau) will leave
Caisse de Depot on June 30, after 10 eventful years at the
agency.
   Mr. Campeau is already intimately familiar with Domtar,
because Caisse de Depot and another Quebec government agency
hold a controlling 44% stake in Domtar.
   Mr. Campeau, who has been a hands-on manager at Caisse de
Depot, is expected to take an active role at Domtar. There is
considerable speculation here that Mr. Campeau will take
advantage of a consolidation of the Canadian forest products
industry in the next few years to add to Domtar's businesses.
   Mr. Campeau said in a prepared statement that he is
"honored to be chosen to preside over the development of this
Quebec multinational {company}." He declined to elaborate.
   At Labatt, a spokeswoman said a successor to Mr.
Desjardins won't be named for at least three weeks.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Domtar shares closed at $10.875, unchanged.
