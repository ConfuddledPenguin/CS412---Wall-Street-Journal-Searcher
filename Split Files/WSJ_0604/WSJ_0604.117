   LOS ANGELES -- MGM/UA Home Video, a unit of MGM/UA
Communications Co., said it reached a sponsorship agreement
with Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Downy fabric softener on a $21
million marketing campaign for the videocassette release of
the animated film "All Dogs Go to Heaven."
   The promotion is similar to last year's $8.5 million
campaign for the videocassette release of "The Wizard of Oz,"
MGM/UA said. As with "Oz," Procter &amp; Gamble will offer a $5
rebate on the $24.98 purchase price. The television portion
of the campaign will begin Aug. 29 and run through Christmas.
