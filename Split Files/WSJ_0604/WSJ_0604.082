   NEW YORK -- Here's one big reason why stock prices climbed
to record levels last week: Earnings expectations for this
year and next are rising.
   After studying first-quarter earnings reports, many
analysts are starting to make much higher 1990 and 1991
corporate earnings forecasts. This trend is especially
evident in three sectors of the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index, according to Zacks Investment Research-technology,
basic materials and noncyclical consumer goods.

   "Something had to cause this eruption in stock prices. It
wasn't just excess cash; analysts turned more optimistic on
earnings," says Benjamin Zacks, executive vice president of
Chicago-based Zacks.
   As for other sectors, profit expectations for energy
companies are flat, while the outlook for utilities is
significantly lower, Zacks says. The profit outlook for
financial companies is improving from a low point, and
forecasts for industrial and cyclical consumer companies are
rising moderately.
   "First-quarter earnings were not as disappointing as the
prior several quarters," Mr. Zacks says. "That provided some
room for optimism for analysts looking at the remainder of
the year and into 1991."
   Analysts say that although their estimates are based
partly on the details of each company's situation, some broad
trends could be discerned in the first-quarter reports: Many
companies are seeing strong earnings in foreign markets where
economic growth is robust; and companies with strong
franchises such as Philip Morris, whose brands include
Marlboro cigarettes and Miller beer, were able to hold the
line on prices despite increased competition.
   Mr. Zacks says analysts don't expect a big jump in
second-quarter earnings but are looking to the third and
fourth quarters and particularly to 1991.
   Strong earnings give stocks a lift both because they mean
dividends may climb and because they raise the value of a
company's assets.
   John Bogle Jr., a vice president at State Street Bank &amp;
Trust Co., Boston, helps manage about $1.5 billion with a
strategy partly based on earnings expectations. "We are
seeing more upward revisions than we did a few months ago,"
he says.
   As an example, he says average 1990 earnings expectations
for Storage Technology have risen to $2.26 a share from about
$1.97 a month ago, based on an analysis of forecasts
submitted to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System.
   The percentage of analysts raising their earnings
forecasts on technology companies rose to 45% in the week
ended May 25 from 35% in the week ended April 13, according
to Zacks. In the stock market, meanwhile, the Dow Jones
Technology Sector Index rose 6.9% from mid-April through
Friday.
   Among consumer companies, Procter &amp; Gamble's 1990 earnings
are projected at $5.05 a share now, compared with less than
$5 a few weeks ago, according to Mr. Bogle. The average
forecast at Philip Morris, also in the non-cyclical consumer
sector, is up to $3.76 a share from $3.65 three months ago,
he says, and more than half of the analysts following the
company have raised their estimates.
   Among basic materials companies, Vista Chemical now is
expected to earn $5.92 a share this year, compared with
forecasts averaging $5.42 a share three months ago, Mr. Bogle
says. At the same time, estimates for Phelps Dodge, a big
copper producer, have jumped to $10.26 a share from $9.11.
   Overall, 36% of the revisions of earnings estimates for
basic materials companies are now positive, compared with 27%
in mid-April, Zacks says. Basic materials stocks, however,
have risen just 2.3% since mid-April, trailing the 5.2% gain
in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index.
   Aggregate earnings estimates for 1990 and 1991 for
companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index show the
same trend. For 1990, the "bottom up" or company-by-company
forecast by analysts covering all 500 stocks is up about 12%
from last year, and the "top down" forecast by economic
strategists shows a 7% increase. Zacks says its analysis of
4,000 stocks, which includes many small issues, shows
expectations of a 16% rise in earnings.
   Moreover, some analysts now say that a rally in growth
stocks -- shares of companies that have a five-year record of
earnings growing 20% annually -- may be just beginning.
Brooke Cobb, manager of Putnam Investors Fund, says investors
now face "an old-fashioned earnings-momentum type of market."
   The change in the way analysts are looking at companies is
subtle but important. Last year, buy-outs were a dominant
theme, and analysts attempted to assess companies for their
private market value, cash flow and other takeover-related
properties.
   "UAL ended that class of analysis," says Mr. Cobb,
referring to the failed buyout of the airline holding
company. "Earnings momentum models and people who invest on
that basis are doing better."
   What's striking is that shares of many high-growth
companies are not trading at large price-earnings multiples.
The average share in a growth-stock index developed by Putnam
Management Co. is trading at a 10% to 15% premium to the
current P-E ratio of the S&amp;P 500.
   "That's a historic low; in the 1972 `nifty 50' era, these
stocks traded at 55 times earnings, or at a 300% premium to
the market," says Mr. Cobb.
   Why are so many stocks with strong earnings prospects
trading relatively cheaply? Mr. Cobb says it's because
takeover-related valuation models were used by some investors
long after they had become irrelevant. Besides, the earnings
outlook was grim in the first quarter, and interest rates
were rising. That combination made cash a more attractive
investment early this year than growth stocks, he says.
   But now, interest rates are falling, making returns on
growth stocks more competitive. The yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond fell to 8.4% Friday. Mr. Cobb says he thinks
several growth stocks can make strong price advances in days
to come. He points out that PepsiCo is trading at a slight
premium to the market, but its earnings expectations continue
to climb. And he says that in their search for strong
earnings growth, many investors will turn to smaller
companies.
   "There is rally potential in a number of growth stocks --
both large and small," Mr. Cobb says.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its third record
close of the week, rising 24.31 to 2900.97 in active trading.
For the week, the industrials were up 80.05 points, or 2.8%.
   Trading was influenced by indications of a slowing economy
and expectations that interest rates will fall. Traders found
their evidence in a report of nearly flat job growth in May
and in a bond market rally.
   The S&amp;P 500-stock index also finished at another record,
adding 1.93 points to 363.16. For the week, it gained 8.58
points, or 2.4%.
   Separately, S&amp;P reported that the number of corporate
dividend increases in the first five months of this year was
down 21% from a year earlier and the number of companies
omitting payouts doubled, continuing an eight-month trend.
   Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook, a
weekly stock-market newsletter, said the data reflect the
recent squeeze on profits and a sharp drop in hostile
takeover activity. In the current market environment,
"companies don't feel the need to please shareholders" with
generous dividends, he said.
   The dividend yield for companies in the S&amp;P 500 dropped to
3.4% from 3.6% in late April, Mr. Kaufman said, adding that
he expects the rate to hold at 3.4% for the rest of the year.
A yield below 3% is a signal that the market may be headed
for a decline. A few months before the October 1987 crash,
the dividend yield had slipped to 2.6%.
   Among the stocks not participating in Friday's rally was
L.A. Gear, which fell 21.7% and was the most active Big Board
stock at 6.6 million shares. The athletic-shoe company said
it expects to report that second-quarter per-share earnings
fell at least 34% from a year earlier. The stock fell 8 1/2
to 30 3/4.
   Large block trades pushed Varity into the second most
active position. It rose 1/8 to 3 3/8 on five million shares.
   Among other active issues, Philip Morris jumped 1 1/8 to
43 1/4 on 2.5 million shares, Westinghouse Electric advanced
7/8 to 37 1/4, and Upjohn surged 1 1/2 to 40 1/8.
   Some technology stocks that have led recent rallies sat
this one out. International Business Machines fell 1/2 to 119
1/2 and Digital Equipment lost 1 to 91 3/4.
   But Commodore International gained 1 to 9 1/8, Compaq
Computer rose 1/2 to 119 3/8, Cray Research gained 1 3/8 to
48 1/2, and Unisys closed 1/2 higher at 15.
   Expectations of lower interest rates helped several bank
stocks, as did Argentina's announcement that it will resume
interest payments on its $60 billion of foreign debt.
Citicorp was up 1 1/4 to 24, Chase Manhattan gained 1/2 to
27, Manufacturers Hanover advanced 1 to 37 5/8, J.P. Morgan
moved 1 1/4 higher to 38 7/8, and Chemical Banking was up 5/8
to 28.
   BankAmerica gained 3/4 to 31 3/8. Resolution Trust Corp.
will allow it to acquire Western Savings &amp; Loan Association,
Arizona's second largest thrift, for about $80 million.
   Oil prices slipped Thursday, and oil stocks fell Friday.
Exxon lost 1/4 to 47 3/4, Mobil was off 1/2 at 62 3/8,
Chevron fell 1/2 to 69 1/2, Amoco closed 1/8 lower at 52 3/4,
Atlantic Richfield fell 1/4 to 118, and Sun closed at 39 1/4,
down 7/8.
   Texaco and Unocal bucked the trend. Texaco rose 1/4 to 59
3/8, and Unocal was 3/8 higher at 29 7/8.
   At Wal-Mart Stores, Chairman Sam Walton said it will be
possible to double the number of stores to 3,000 over the
next 10 years. Mr. Walton also projected more than $30
billion in sales this year, compared with $25.8 billion last
year. Wal-Mart closed 2 higher at 58 3/8.
   May Department Stores predicted record earnings and sales
for the year, but its stock finished 3/8 lower at 57 1/2.
   Tribune rose 1 3/8 to 44 3/8. Goldman Sachs moved the
stock to its "focus list."
   Burlington Resources gained 1 1/4 to 43 5/8. Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said investors may have been
reacting to test results from a Burlington unit's discovery
well in the Austin Chalk Trend in Texas. The company said it
is too early to call the discovery significant.
   Lowe's finished 1 1/4 higher at 48 1/2. The company told
analysts that 1991 earnings could be higher than previous
estimates.
