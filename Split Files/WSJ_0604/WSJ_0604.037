   PARIS -- Airbus Industrie said Iberia Air Lines of Spain
placed a firm order for eight of the European aircraft
manufacturing consortium's A-321 passenger jets, following
through on a memorandum of understanding announced in July.
Financial details weren't disclosed, though people in the
industry estimate the price of an A-321 is slightly less than
$50 million.
   The planes will be delivered beginning in mid-1994. The
A-321 is a stretched version of the A-320, a short-haul to
medium-haul aircraft that is scheduled to enter service in
1994. Airbus said Iberia took an undetermined amount of new
options on additional aircraft.
