   THE OFFICE OF TODAY: An employee arrives in the morning
full of hope, sits behind a desk -- and feels sick. It's easy
to see why.
   On the left side of the desk, the in-basket totters under
a load of fresh paper work. Some of it has spilled onto a
three-ring binder hogging a couple of square feet of
adjoining space. It's a procedures manual; everybody has one,
and nobody uses it.

   The employee's eye moves past the Rolodex (many entries
are out of order and others are illegible); the gee-whiz
telephone with its advanced features that have never been
mastered; and a stack of legal pads and notebooks. The
employee's gaze rests finally on a formless heap of paper
that has settled over the whole right-hand side of the desk.
Somewhere in there are crucial warehouse inventory reports
and faxes that need responses. The remaining work space, a
tiny, irregular oval, is lightly dusted with paper clips,
notes and a scattering of pens, some of them defunct.

   And the office of the future, say 10 years or so from now?
Still a mess. But different. Much different.
   Paper won't disappear, but there will be tons less of it
on the desktop. Instead of the bulky personal computer next
to the desk, a single worker may have many computers that
won't look -- or function -- at all like what's available
now. And there is the prospect of an electronic organism we
can call Hydra, the office equivalent of the nine-headed
monster that Hercules slew as one of his labors.
   Experts in computers and office applications are by no
means in unanimous agreement about the exact shape of the
office of the future. But their differences are overshadowed
by general agreement on broad developmental themes.
   Today's office workers have to take action to plug
themselves into the electronic-information flow. Tomorrow's
workers will have to take action to cut themselves out of it,
and their bosses might raise an eyebrow if they do.
   One reason: Cellular modems will vastly expand the reach
of computer communications. Right now anyone who isn't
connected to a wire, telephone or otherwise is blissfully out
of touch. With the wireless communication that cellular
technology makes possible, it will be hard to hide.
   Many experts believe that this development, and others
paralleling it, will lead to networks enmeshing people and
their computers around the clock and around the world.
"You'll be reachable, no matter when it is, no matter where
you are," says Norman Weizer, senior consultant at Arthur D.
Little Inc. "The problem will be how much privacy you want."
Some related predictions:
   -- Few computers will have on-off switches; they will be
on all the time, receiving phone messages, storing electronic
mail (e-mail, as it's called, will become as important as the
telephone), and nagging their principal users to reply.
Moreover, workers will be equipped with locaters; their
office computer will be able to raise them -- on the golf
course, at the movies, wherever and whenever. In big offices,
a single human secretary manning an electronic locater board
will be able to tell the boss where everybody is at any
moment.
   -- Wherever you are, your work can be with you; the
"office in a briefcase" will be reality. Even if they're only
going down the hall, executives will carry a pocket-sized
phone and often a lightweight, full-featured computer as
well. The computer will have a cellular modem, allowing it to
stay in touch with its parent at the office. "We're not
talking about Dick Tracy's wristwatch computer here," says
Mr. Weizer. "But it'll be pretty close."
   For the people who love to wheel and deal on their car
phones, this new world will be a dream of connectivity come
true. For anyone who hates the very idea of being tied to
even such a simple device as a beeper, it will be a
nightmare.
   Tomorrow's desktop will have its own special kind of
litter, if Mark Weiser is right. He is head of the computer
science laboratory at Xerox Corp.'s famed Palo Alto Research
Center, where many advances in computing during the 1980s
were shaped. Mr. Weiser sees an office not piled with paper
but strewn with computers.
   "By the year 2000, the personal computer as we know it
will start to die away," he predicts. "When you walk into an
office, you won't see a recognizable computer: no monitor, no
obvious keyboard. But in fact, you'll be looking at several
hundred computers. They'll be all over -- on files, in
drawers, on other computers."
   Some will be small but powerful "notepad" computers. Each
will be dedicated to a special task or tasks, and each will
be able to recognize its user's handwriting, which will be
scrawled directly on its screen surface with a stylus. One
may be used for drafting correspondence, for example, while
another will hold information on customers. Still others may
be "scrap computers" used to record an executive's random
thoughts and jottings -- even doodles -- in electronic form.
   Mr. Weiser envisions even tinier machines, high-tech
"Post-it" computers that will allow users to add their
comments, data, and even voice messages to just about
anything in sight. Such a computer may cling to an optical
disk that holds accounting data, for instance, giving its
user details of seven accounts that must be modified during
the next accounting cycle. And all these computers will
communicate with one another via cellular linkups, so that
documents zip from place to place invisibly.
   Most other experts, however, believe that workers 10 years
from now will still depend mainly on one computer rather than
many, and will still be typing at keyboards at least some of
the time. But they agree with Mr. Weiser on other important
elements. Predictions:
   -- Computer screens will be flat, not the bulky vacuum
tubes of today. They could be hung on walls like pictures,
or, more likely, be set unobtrusively into desktops.
   -- Handwriting recognition will indeed flourish, as Mr.
Weiser believes, and there will be some note-pad and similar
computers in the office environment. Desktop computers may
have a note pad as well as a keyboard. Because the technology
isn't intimidating -- it works just like a pen and paper --
note-pad computers will become invaluable for secretaries,
journalists, and others who deal with people.
   "Can you imagine sitting across from someone and tapping
away at a keyboard while they're talking?" asks Jerry Kaplan,
a computer pioneer whose Go Corp. is developing a note-pad
computer. "This technology will break through the barriers
that computers have raised between people." The combination
of the accessible flat screen and handwriting recognition
will induce even technophobic chief executives to make much
greater use of computers.
   -- Computers will also be able to communicate through
voice, though the experts are split on how prevalent this
will be. Many envision computers that accept certain voice
commands (that's possible already) and perhaps even computers
that take dictation. Pierre Hessler, director of marketing
and services at International Business Machines Corp., raises
the possibility of computers that hook into telephones and
translate foreign languages as they are spoken.
   But will users take to applications like this? Mr. Weizer
of Arthur D. Little is skeptical. "People don't like talking
to machines, and they don't like machines talking to them,"
he says.
   Aside from looking different, computers in 2000 will be
vastly more powerful. Most experts predict that everyday
desktop computers will pack at least the power of today's
mainframes -- 100 mips, or millions of instructions per
second -- and possibly a lot more. Some of this muscle will
be directed at making computers faster, but a lot will go
toward making them far more versatile and much easier to use.
Some of the things more power will bring:
   -- Almost all computers will have color displays that
approach photographic quality and are extremely intuitive --
so easy to understand that someone with no training at all
could look at the screen and easily see how to get a desired
result. Some experts, including Paul Saffo of the Institute
for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., suggest that the
computer will take on multiple personalities, depending on
what the user wants it to do. Instead of calling up a
scheduling program, for example, an executive may hit a
single button that summons a computer "secretary," who will
remind the executive of a Thursday squash game. Or the
executive may simply touch a tiny picture, or icon, on the
screen representing a secretary.
   -- Computers will be able to handle video images easily.
Video capability is important for "multimedia" computing, the
mixing of data with sound and images, but it may also open
the door to video communication.
   By 2000, the computer will be closely linked to the
telephone, and the two may have merged entirely. People will
still communicate by voice but improved telecommunications
technology (known as Integrated Service Digital Network, or
ISDN) will allow live pictures and lots of data to be
transmitted too. These will start popping up on computer
screens. Says Franklin Reece, chairman of Boston-based
USTeleCenters Inc.: "In 10 years we're going to know people a
lot better. We'll be looking at each other when we talk, and
we'll have their kid's birthday and their favorite food at
our fingertips."
   -- With so many computers hooked together and so much
information flying around, data security and data integrity
will be big issues. Lots of computing power will be devoted
to keeping records safe from tampering: Before it allows
anyone to open a file or change a document, a computer may
ask for voice identification, a thumbprint or a retina scan.
   -- Computer programs using artificial intelligence will
sift through the avalanche of information and present it in a
way tailored to the precise needs of the user. "People will
get a competitive edge just from the way they sort through
information," says computer columnist John Dvorak. "Those who
have better methods will keep them secret, sharing with only
a few friends." Bond traders, for example, will jealously
guard proprietary software that isolates the nuggets of
information on which they buy and sell.
   Computers and telephones aren't the only machines that
will get closer together. By 2000, most office technology
will be digital -- allowing different parts of it to
communicate in a common language.
   To many experts, this suggests an inevitable merger of
several machines that now operate separately because they
don't understand each other. In time, they say, we probably
won't be able to point to any office machine (except perhaps
the coffee maker) and define its purpose with a simple
phrase.
   Fax machines, all the rage now, won't exist. To send a
letter, a picture or graph -- all of which will be generated
on a computer screen -- around the world, users will need
only to push the "send " button on their computers to achieve
a paperless transmission. As for copiers, they, too, will be
submerged as recognizable entities, transformed into the
scanning and printing arms of a unified, computerized work
organism.
   That organism, some experts say, could easily take the
shape of a single desktop machine performing many functions.
"A machine like a Hydra won't be multifunctional because it's
designed to be multifunctional," says Jim Ivy of Ricoh Corp.,
which is experimenting with such devices. "It will be
multifunctional because that's where the technology naturally
leads."
