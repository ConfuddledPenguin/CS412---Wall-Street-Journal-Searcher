   ROCKY RIVER, Ohio -- SIS Corp. said it withdrew its plan
of reorganization from U.S. bankruptcy court because the
financing needed to fund the plan couldn't be obtained.
   SIS said its next plan will propose the sale of the
company's assets and won't provide any payments to company
shareholders. The court has instructed the company to file a
new plan within 45 days.

   Until the sale of assets occurs, the company said it will
continue to operate its chain of Sisters Chicken &amp; Biscuits
restaurants.
   The company has been under bankruptcy-law protection since
February 1989.
