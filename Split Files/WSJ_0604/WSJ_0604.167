   Some commodity traders stake real money on the idea that
price patterns for many commodities repeat themselves about
the same time each year.
   Such seasonal price action once was detectable only with
painstaking and haphazard study. Today, computers sniff out
such patterns easily.

   Pacific Research Center in Eugene, Ore., a wholly owned
operation of Stotler &amp; Co., a Chicago-based futures broker,
looks for seasonal trades with a high probability of being
profitable. Recently, the firm issued its recommendations for
12 seasonal trades that begin in June and have been
profitable at least 80% of the time over the past 15 years.
(Seasonal reliability for Treasury notes and Eurodollars
could only be checked for eight years because their contracts
have only been trading that long.)
   In many cases the seasonal price pattern can be attributed
to the seasonality that affects all agricultural commodities.
For example, prices for some agricultural commodities drop
just after their harvest begins. However, traders who use
seasonal price patterns don't look for explanations but
reliable repetition. Surprisingly, even when a price pattern
becomes well-known among traders it doesn't necessarily
disappear -- contrary to what market theorists assert.
   John Crane, research director at Pacific Research Center,
urges traders not to buy into every highly repetitive
seasonal trade without considering other factors. "We suggest
to clients that they try to combine our seasonal work with
other technical studies before taking a trade," he says. If,
for example, short-term price moves in the market being
studied are going in the same direction as the seasonal
pattern, he says traders can be more confident that a trade
will work.
   "Sometimes we will pass up a seasonal trade completely if
the price patterns of the commodity seem to be out of line,"
adds Mr. Crane.
   Just because a seasonal price move has demonstrated high
reliability in the past is no guarantee that it will do so
again. For that reason Pacific Research Center has used its
computer to calculate an optimum amount of money that should
be risked on each seasonal trade. If a seasonal trade goes
the wrong way and produces a bigger loss than the amount
shown in the table accompanying this story, Mr. Crane
suggests abandoning the trade. Pacific Research uses closing
prices only to determine profits and losses.
   Mr. Crane also recommends that when a seasonal trade has a
paper profit at least equal to the average amount shown in
the table, traders should protect that profit with an order
that would close out the position at a price that would leave
at least half the profit intact.
   "Many times I have seen seasonals quickly move to a profit
and then give up most, or all, of that profit in subsequent
days," he says.
   The report prepared by Pacific Research Center gives not
only the data shown in the nearby table but also shows for
each year studied the maximum profit and the biggest loss
produced during the trade. In addition it gives the dates
these profits and losses were made. Mr. Crane says readers
who wish to receive a copy of the June report may call
800-365-8000, or write to Pacific Research Center, 85180

   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Precious Metals
                                                                                                       

   Gold futures fell to new life-of-contract lows Friday,
further darkening the metal's already-gloomy situation.
Traders this week will be watching to see if and where
underlying support develops to brake the decline.
   The latest pressure on gold came from reports that the
Soviet Union has run out of hard currency and has asked for
credit extensions to pay for a number of commodities it has
bought, analysts said.
   The belief among traders is that the Soviet Union has been
swapping gold with foreign banks to obtain hard currency,
said William O'Neill, vice president of research for Elders
Futures, New York. Foreign banks, in turn, are hedging the
swapped gold to protect themselves against a loss in value
while they hold it, further depressing prices, he said.
   "We'll likely see more of this in coming months, and this
doesn't take into consideration South Africa, which has
foreign exchange problems of its own," he said.
   Mr. O'Neill also observed that traders have been
negatively conditioned by the two recent big Saudi Arabian
sales of gold that caused prices to plunge, and they're
braced for another round. "This is keeping a damper on
investment enthusiasm," he said.
   However, Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious
Metals Advisors, of Toronto, notes that the National
Commercial Bank of Jeddah, which was credited with making the
big gold sales, mightn't do it again. "The Saudi Arabian
Monetary Authority and the Saudi royal family, {which hold}
significant gold reserves and investments, could not have
been pleased to see the metal's price fall so sharply," he
says.
   The National Commercial Bank has important ties to the
central bank and the royal family, "so much so that a word
from the authorities could guarantee there are no further
disruptive dealings," Mr. Nichols says.
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   This is the week for OPEC numbers -- estimates of May
production and perhaps even preliminary indications for June.
The Paris-based International Energy Agency will release its
estimates of May crude oil volumes for the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Some other OPEC output
monitors may be out with early-June guesses.
   These reports are important because they could signal the
direction of petroleum prices over the summer. Most analysts
agree the major factor now in determining the price outlook
is how much OPEC trims its output to shrink the world oil
glut. And most forecasters are bearish after the
roller-coaster oil market that sizzled briefly last week
before its gasoline-fed rally collapsed.
   But some, such as Fereidun Fesharaki of the Resource
Systems Institute at Honolulu's East-West Center, see oil
prices recovering. "Although the reduction in oil production
has been slow in the OPEC countries," Mr. Fesharaki said,
"the reduction is nevertheless real and {the} impact of such
cuts will soon be observed." In the U.S. cash market, he
expects West Texas Intermediate crude to rise $1 a barrel in
June to $19 and by another $1.75 in July before falling back
some to $20 in August.
                                                                                                       

   Grains &amp; Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Today analysts will try to determine whether last week's
dry weather allowed Midwest corn farmers to complete their
rain-delayed planting.
   Analysts expect the weekly progress reports issued by the
Midwest states today to show that corn farmers have nearly
completed planting their fields. The general rule of thumb is
that most Midwest fields must be planted by June 1 for the
corn crop to obtain maximum yield. After that date, many
farmers will shift their fields to other crops, such as
soybeans.
   If the weekly reports show that a significant amount of
corn fields haven't been planted as planned, analysts will
trim their estimates of the corn harvest.
   Grain traders will also watch interest rates this week. A
drop would imply that a deflationary mood is building in the
financial markets -- which might signal that commodity prices
would come under downward pressure.

   SEASONAL FUTURES TRADES recommended by Pacific Research
Center, listed in a table accompanying the commodities story
in yesterday's edition, should have said to buy September
Eurodollar futures on June 25 and sell them on July 20. The
table misstated this trade recommendation.
