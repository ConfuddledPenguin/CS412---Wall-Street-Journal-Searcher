   WASHINGTON -- President Bush emerged from the latest
superpower summit with his foreign policy stalled by Mikhail
Gorbachev's unwillingness or inability to compromise on
German unification and Europe's future.
   The meager results of the four days of talks raise serious
questions about whether the U.S. and Soviet presidents can
meet the historic goals they set in December at Malta: to
sign two major arms-control pacts and settle Germany's future
in a series of meetings scheduled for the rest of this year.

   The disappointing outcome leaves in doubt whether Mr. Bush
will be able to fulfill his top foreign policy objective,
which is to lock in these sweeping agreements remaking the
face of Europe on Western terms while Mr. Gorbachev remains
powerful enough to conclude them.
   Despite Mr. Gorbachev's public protests to the contrary,
it seemed clear during the summit that he is worried about a
challenge to his power from maverick Russian leader Boris
Yeltsin and uncertain how to deal with the demand by tiny
Lithuania for independence from the U.S.S.R. He complained
about both in bitter terms during meetings with U.S.
officials, who were dismayed by his new rigidity.
   "I think the summit was a triumph for Gorbachev," said
Richard Perle, the Pentagon's top strategist during the
Reagan administration. "He came here weak, managed to appear
strong, collected concessions on arms control and trade, and
gave up nothing."
   Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, a leading Congressional
Democrat on foreign affairs, termed the summit a success for
improving the tone of superpower relations, but conceded that
"the two big issues there are still there. I didn't see any
discernible movement" on Germany or Lithuania.
   One of the administration's top foreign policy officials
said after the summit that "I don't think things have
advanced very much, certainly not in any substantive sense.
Our impression is that Gorbachev still hasn't come to terms
with the changes in Germany and Europe and they still don't
have specific positions."
   Mr. Bush and his aides put a brave face on the meeting,
heaping lavish public praise on Mr. Gorbachev, whose
popularity has been sinking at home. Both men stressed they
had grown closer personally. The U.S. president tried to
boost Mr. Gorbachev's standing by signing a trade agreement
the Soviet leader repeatedly pleaded for as a political
symbol. Moreover, Mr. Bush suggested that his decision on
whether to send the trade pact to Congress for approval won't
be linked to Mr. Gorbachev ending his economic embargo on
Lithuania, but only to passage of a new Soviet emigration
law.
   Yet the Soviet leader refused to budge on the U.S. demand
that a united Germany be a full member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and that a conventional arms pact be
signed to formally seal the Red Army's retreat from Eastern
Europe.
   "I'm not sure we narrowed" differences over Germany, Mr.
Bush said at the concluding news conference, at which both
leaders spoke.
   U.S. officials saw glimmers of hope in two stands Mr.
Gorbachev took in private talks on Germany. In one meeting
the Soviet leader said he agreed in principle with Mr. Bush
that the German people have the right to pick their
alliances. Such a Soviet position could clear the way for a
vote by Germans to join NATO.
   But Mr. Gorbachev didn't explain in subsequent meetings
what he meant, Bush administration aides said, and the U.S.
isn't sure how meaningful his remarks were. He pointedly
avoided repeating them at the closing news conference. Some
U.S. officials think he simply blundered and was straightened
out later by his staff.
   Mr. Gorbachev also suggested overcoming the German impasse
by having NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the East bloc military
alliance, meet to solve the issue. But the proposal was
vague, and U.S. officials aren't sure how it would work.
   Offsetting those vague glimmers of hope, Mr. Gorbachev
seemed at yesterday's press conference to toughen his stands
on three key matters:
   -- On Germany and NATO, the Soviet leader issued a vague
threat that if a united Germany were to enter the Western
alliance, the U.S.S.R. would review its recent military
cutbacks and arms control concessions. "Then we should go
back and see where we are," he said. "What's happening to our
security? What should we be doing with our armed forces,
which we are both reforming and reducing?"
   -- On Lithuania, Mr. Gorbachev asserted that it could take
as long as seven years to negotiate the Baltic republic's
secession, instead of the two to three years he'd recently
suggested.
   -- On emigration by Soviet Jews, he threatened to slow or
halt the issuance of exit permits unless Israel stopped
settling the emigrants in occupied Arab territory. "Either .
. . our concern will be heeded in Israel and they will make
certain conclusions. Or else we must give further thought to
it in terms of what we can do with issuing permits for exit."
   Mr. Gorbachev's comments on Jewish emigration are likely
to further fuel an emotional debate about Mr. Bush's decision
to sign a trade agreement with the Soviet Union at the
summit. Mr. Bush had entered the summit uncertain about
whether he would agree to sign it, both because the Soviet
legislature still hasn't passed a new emigration law required
before the Soviets can receive most-favored nation trade
status, and because of unhappiness over Lithuania.
   But in the end, Mr. Gorbachev won American approval of a
trade agreement, partly by making unusually intense personal
appeals directly to President Bush. He urged completion of
the trade pact three separate times in his private meetings
with Mr. Bush, administration officials said. At the same
time, lower-ranking Soviet officials were suggesting that if
Mr. Gorbachev didn't get the trade agreement he wanted, he
wouldn't sign a five-year agreement to buy millions of tons
of grain from the U.S., a sale that politically potent
American farmers badly want.
   The combination of Mr. Gorbachev's appeals and the threat
against a grain deal convinced Bush aides that Mr. Gorbachev
needed the political boost of the trade agreement more than
they suspected.
   Just before the deal was signed, Secretary of State James
Baker bluntly told Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze that the trade pact could be challenged by
American lawmakers unless Mr. Gorbachev lifts his economic
embargo against Lithuania and opens serious negotiations with
the breakaway republic. Despite such warnings, Mr. Bush
acknowledged yesterday that the U.S. hasn't received any
"assurances" from Mr. Gorbachev that the embargo will be
lifted. But administration officials said the president came
away from a long, private talk with Mr. Gorbachev reassured
that the Soviet leader will try to find a politically
palatable way out of the Lithuania deadlock.
   Still, American conservatives will be incensed by Mr.
Bush's decision to sign the trade deal without winning in
return any guarantees that Lithuania will receive its
freedom. They will be further angered by Mr. Bush's
indication that he won't link the situation in Lithuania to
his eventual decision about sending the trade deal to
Congress for approval.
   The American right also is likely to gripe that Mr.
Gorbachev gave up too little on arms control. The meeting had
been billed as an "arms control" summit at which it would be
announced that the major issues in long-range nuclear missile
talks, called START, were settled. There also were
predictions of major progress on conventional arms talks,
which are really an exercise aimed at legally affirming the
Soviet retreat from Eastern Europe.
   But even the summit's progress in arms control was less
than expected. To be sure, the two presidents did sign
treaties curbing chemical weapons and nuclear arms testing.
They also issued a statement listing agreements on a START
treaty. But three of the four major START issues unresolved
at the summit's outset were still hanging when the meeting
ended. Two of these -- limits on tests of heavy missiles and
on the Soviet Backfire bomber -- are considered critical by
American conservatives, who fear the U.S. will wind up giving
the Soviets too much leeway.
   The conventional forces talks moved ahead slightly during
the summit. The two sides apparently agreed on a definition
of what constitutes a tank and made progress on the issue of
destroying excess weapons.
   But the Soviets are indicating that their willingness to
reduce their traditional edge in conventional arms depends on
the outcome of the dispute over Germany. Moscow can't flatly
block German unification unless it unleashes its 380,000
troops in East Germany to stop it by force, something the
U.S. hardly expects. But Mr. Gorbachev can deny the new
Germany full sovereignty and freedom in its probable capital,
Berlin, by refusing to relinquish rights over Germany the
U.S.S.R. acquired as a World War II victor. And he can refuse
to set a firm date for withdrawing Soviet forces from East
German territory.
   To try to calm Soviet fears about Germany in NATO, Mr.
Bush trotted out nine uncontroversial American ideas, such as
ensuring that Germany not build nuclear weapons, and
presented them as a package. But the U.S. effort to give Mr.
Gorbachev a political fig leaf for losing Eastern Europe
seemed to fail, at least for now.
   One reason may be that Moscow, in its separate direct
talks with West Germany, is trying to extract a large
economic and political price for Soviet acquiescence in
unification. Any early agreement by the Soviets could lower
the ultimate price Bonn would pay.
