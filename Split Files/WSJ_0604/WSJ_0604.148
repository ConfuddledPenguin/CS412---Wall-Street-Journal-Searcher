   Manville Corp. was ordered to return to federal bankruptcy
court to consider making major changes in the funding and
operation of the trust that the company formed to pay
asbestos claims.
   The order, issued jointly by a U.S. district judge and a
New York state judge, criticized the fund as being
inadequately funded and unfairly administered. The changes
recommended by the judges could have implications for
thousands of Manville asbestos personal-injury claimants
nationwide.

Helen Freedman also left open the possibility that they will
lift a court order preventing asbestos victims from suing the
company, rather than the trust. The judges said they were
wary of taking such a step because it might hurt the company
that funds the trust.
   The judges estimate that the trust will need $7.5 billion
to pay pending and future claims. "There's no way (the
company) is putting enough money in the trust to take care of
$7.5 billion in claims," Judge Weinstein said. "At most the
trust appears to be worth $1.5 billion. . . . The 100,000
claims and the limited access (to funds) cries out for a more
workable and compassionate system."
   The judges said the best way to temporarily cover the
trust's shortfall may be for the company to advance the trust
from $200 million to $300 million.
   Trust and company officials wouldn't comment on details of
the judges' proposals. Previously, trust officials have said
that a shortage was expected in the early years of the trust.
Manville will begin making regular payments to the trust in
August 1991.
   The judges directed the company and the trust to meet with
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland, who approved
Manville's 1988 Chapter 11 reorganization. It was the
formation of the trust that enabled Manville to emerge from
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Judge Weinstein and Justice Freedman gave the company five
weeks to take up the matter with Judge Lifland, and 10 days
for the trust to file a report in response to the proposals.
   The Denver company, which was holding its annual meeting
as the judges issued their order, tried to put the best face
on the matter, focusing on indications that the judges aren't
eager to lift the injunction barring suits against the
company.
   "We are pleased that the judges agreed that the most
important element of the plan is the provision which prevents
suits against the company and directs all settlements to the
(trust)," Manville said in a statement. Manville said the
injunction, which was part of the bankruptcy reorganization
plan, allows the company to provide maximum value to
shareholders, including the trust, which holds 50% of the
company's common stock and eventually could hold 80%.
   "Suits against Manville would substantially reduce the
value of the trust's assets," the company said. Officials
said they wouldn't be able to comment further until the
middle of this week.
   In their order, the judges also said, "The trust's funds
must be stretched by cutting administrative costs and fees to
both its own and plaintiffs' attorneys." The judges also
recommended changes in the way the trust ranks claimants.
Rather than giving priority to early claimants, the trust
should pay the sickest individuals first, the judges said.
Currently, new claimants aren't expected to be paid for
nearly 20 years, no matter how severe their illness or how
long ago they were diagnosed.
   Separately, Manville named Tom Stephens, president and
chief executive officer, to the additional post of chairman,
succeeding George C. Dillon. Mr. Dillon, who became chairman
of the company while it was still under Chapter 11
proceedings in 1986, will remain a director and chairman of
the executive committee.
   At the annual meeting, Mr. Stephens reiterated a forecast
that the sluggish construction and automotive industries will
push Manville's earnings down in 1990.
   The company also said it agreed to buy Fiskeby Board AB, a
unit of Kooporativa Forbundet Industri AB. Terms weren't
disclosed. The company said Fiskeby, which supplies
paperboard to Sweden, other Scandinavian countries and the
U.K., will complement Manville's purchase in April of DRG
Cartons Ltd., a large beverage carton maker in the U.K.
