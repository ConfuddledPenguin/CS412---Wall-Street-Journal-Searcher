   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. director Murray Pezim said the
company will announce today an improved offer for Stikine
Resources Ltd., upping the ante in a battle for control of a
Canadian gold property.
   Mr. Pezim also said Corona, based here, will announce
plans to spin off its gold assets into a separately listed
company that would offer to acquire all the shares of Prime
Resources Group Inc. Prime Resources is Stikine's partner and
the operator of the promising Eskay Creek gold project in
northwestern British Columbia. Corona already owns 20% of the
stock in Prime Resources, of which Mr. Pezim is chairman.
Prime Resources and Stikine are both based in Vancouver.

   Mr. Pezim's disclosure unravels efforts by Corona's
management to keep the news under wraps until this morning.
Trading in shares of Corona, Stikine and Prime has been
halted since last week.
   Mr. Pezim, who is also honorary chairman of Corona, has
been in hot water before with the company's management. In a
fiery 1987 boardroom battle, Mr. Pezim, commonly known as
"the Pez," was ousted from an executive position amid
management charges that he had talked to the media about
proposed Corona transactions that hadn't been considered by
the Corona board.
   A Corona spokesman wouldn't comment on the accuracy of the
latest disclosures, but said Corona Chairman Ned Goodman was
"very concerned" about Mr. Pezim's statements. "Murray talked
when he shouldn't have," the spokesman said.
   According to Mr. Pezim, Corona will offer 6.5 Corona Class
A shares and two Prime Resources shares for each share of
Stikine.
   The revised Corona offer would have an indicated value of
about 257.3 million Canadian dollars (US$219.6 million), or
C$75.69 a Stikine share, based on market prices before the
trading halt went into effect. This is higher than a rival
bid by Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver, which has offered
C$229.5 million, or C$67.50 for each Stikine share. Placer is
offering cash with a share alternative.
   Despite a possibly higher offer from Corona, analysts
weren't convinced that the Placer bid would be the less
favorable of the two. The gap between the bids "is quickly
closed when one considers one {offer} is cash and the other
isn't," said Egizio Bianchini, an analyst at Nesbitt Thomson
Deacon Inc.
   Corona's previous offer involved a complex plan under
which it would acquire a 44.6% stake in a company that was to
be formed from the merger of Stikine and Prime Resources. In
exchange, Corona was to issue to Stikine holders a package of
securities that analysts valued at anywhere from C$65 to C$70
a Stikine share.
   Mr. Pezim said that under Corona's plan to spin off its
gold assets, shareholders will receive one share in the new
gold company for every 2.27 Corona shares currently held.
   Corona is one of North America's biggest gold-mining
concerns, with production last year of about 680,000 ounces
of gold. The company also has interests in industrial
minerals and oil and gas.
   "At the end, Corona will control 45%" of the new gold
company, Mr. Pezim said. He said the gold subsidiary will be
based in Vancouver, with Peter Steen, Corona's president and
chief executive, serving as chairman of the new company. John
Ivany, president and chief executive of Prime Resources, will
serve in the same roles at the new company, Mr. Pezim said.
   Mr. Pezim said the new gold company will then bid to
acquire Prime Resources, offering one share of the new gold
company for each Prime Resources share.
