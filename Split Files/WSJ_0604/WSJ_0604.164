   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -- Genentech Inc. said it conducted an
AIDS-vaccine experiment that protected two chimpanzees from
the virus.
   In its anouncement, the company broke the tradition of
silence before publication of results. A full report is
scheduled to appear in the British journal Nature in the
middle of this month.

   Scientists inside and outside the company called the
experiments a step forward, but one requiring years of
refinement before a practical vaccine is at hand. "These
findings provide encouragement that an AIDS vaccine may one
day be developed, but work on the project, if successful,
will take several years," Genentech acknowledged.
   In the experiment, scientists vaccinated two chimpanzees
with a gene-spliced copy of the virus's outer coat, called
gp120. Then the vaccinated chimps, along with an unvaccinated
control animal, were "challenged," or exposed to a live
infectious dose of the same strain of the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome virus, reportedly the IIIB strain. Seven
weeks later, the control animal showed signs of infection.
The vaccinated animals, however, still haven't shown signs of
infection more than six months after exposure.
   Although a Genentech release declared the work to be a
"first," the test came to light after similar work by Marc
Girard of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who announced at an
April meeting in Colorado that he had immunized two chimps
against infection by using a mixture of several proteins from
the AIDS virus.
   Previously, U.S. researchers in Boston and New Orleans had
reported success in shielding primates against simian AIDS by
innoculating the animals with killed-virus vaccine.
   Genentech's success is sufficient to revive the company's
vaccine program, which was relegated to the back burner for
about two years. Early setbacks and failure to induce
protective immunity in chimps had led Genentech to scale back
the work to a basic research project in mid-1987. Now, it has
been restored as a major development project, a spokesman
said.
   Genentech said it plans to test the vaccine in people as
soon as the company completes arrangements with federal
agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An
announcement is expected this summer. The company plans tests
in both uninfected volunteers, as well as in infected people,
to see whether the vaccine has a role in allaying the course
of disease in those already exposed.
   "It's potentially a promising lead," said Daniel Hoth,
head of the AIDS program at NIAID in Bethesda, Md. However he
cautioned against too much enthusiasm because only two
animals were used and because the challenge was made with
precisely the same strain used to make the vaccine -- unlike
a real world situation in which an individual might be
infected by any of several different strains.
   Competitors also lent credence to the report, saying it
confirms and adds to the body of knowledge about protective
immunity in animals.
   "This experiment confirms work done by {our collaborators
at} Merck &amp; Co., and by Marc Girard at the Pasteur," said
Scott Putney, director of molecular biology at Repligen Corp.
of Cambridge, Mass., which has a major vaccine program. He
asserted that the test lends suppport for Repligen's focus on
a tiny portion of the virus coat called "the loop," which
many believe will be the key part of any protein-based
vaccine.
   "That's where the action is," Mr. Putney said, explaining
that he believes it's the loop that sparks the body's
production of neutralizing antibodies against the virus. He
added that his group at Repligen is trying to overcome the
problem of the AIDS virus's many strains by making a
"cocktail" vaccine designed to spark immunity against 80% of
such strains.
   A full report of the vaccine experiment is scheduled to
appear in Nature on June 14. Normally, any pre-publication
promotion is prohibited by the editors of scientific
journals. "It's a little unusual. It's not a normal action
for Genentech," said Denise Gilbert, a securities analyst
with Montgomery Securities.
   However, Genentech spokesman Jack Murphy said the company
got permission to make a brief early announcement because "we
wanted to be able to discuss our full development program" a
week before publication at the company's annual meeting on
June 8. At that meeting, Genentech shareholders are expected
to vote on the proposed $2.1 billion merger with the giant
Swiss drug firm, Roche Holding Ltd.
   The vaccine work was led by Genentech scientists Phillip
W. Berman and Timothy J. Gregory, in collaboration with Jorg
Eichberg, director of chimp studies at the Southwest
Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio, Texas.
