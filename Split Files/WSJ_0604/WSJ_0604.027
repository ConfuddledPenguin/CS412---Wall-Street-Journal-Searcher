   TOKYO (AP) -- Toshiba Machine Co., which the U.S. and
Japan penalized in 1988 for exporting sensitive machinery to
the Soviet Union, now says it doesn't know what happened to
an earlier shipment of high-tech equipment that may have made
its way to China.
   A Japanese magazine says the machinery, used for making
computer memory chips, reached China, despite an
international agreement at the time that prohibited the
shipment of such equipment to the communist nation.

   Toshiba Machine says it sold the equipment in 1985 to a
company in Hong Kong, but that it doesn't know where it went
after that.
   Toshiba Machine suffered U.S. and Japanese sanctions when
it was disclosed it had sidestepped the same agreement, known
as COCOM, in exporting sensitive machinery in 1984 that
allegedly permitted the Soviet Union to make submarines
quieter and more difficult to detect.
   In 1988, Washington barred the parent company, the
electronic-goods company Toshiba Corp., which holds 50% of
Toshiba Machine, from bidding for U.S. government contracts
for one year, and Toshiba Machine was banned from exporting
anything to the U.S. for three years. Japan blocked Toshiba
Machine indefinitely from exports to communist countries.
