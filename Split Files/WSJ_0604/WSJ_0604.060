   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it will consider
lowering its ratings on debt and preferred stock of Xerox
Corp. and several of its subsidiaries.
   About $2 billion of the parent company's debt is affected.

   S&amp;P said its review is a result of the possible effect of
problems at the company's Crum &amp; Forster insurance unit.
Separately, S&amp;P said it will consider lowering its rating on
Crum &amp; Forster's claims-paying ability, citing uncertainty
about the quality of the company's reinsurance arrangements
and continuing weakness in the property-casualty market.
   S&amp;P said it was concerned about Crum &amp; Forster's potential
for producing charges against Xerox's earnings, and its
possible need for capital infusions from the parent. It also
said it will review Crum &amp; Forster's ability to contribute to
dividends to Xerox, a business equipment and financial
services concern based in Stamford, Conn.
   Aside from the Crum &amp; Forster rating, which is double-A,
S&amp;P placed on its CreditWatch list: Xerox's senior debt,
rated single-A-plus; its subordinated debt, rated single-A;
its preferred stock, rated single-A-plus; Xerox Credit
Corp.'s senior debt, rated single-A-plus; and Xerox Credit
Overseas Finance NV's senior debt, rated single-A-plus.
   In a statement, Xerox said: "We are obviously disappointed
at this announcement and will meet with representatives of
Standard &amp; Poor's in the near future. Our balance sheet is
healthy and we have sound strategies in place to improve
financial performance and shareholder value."
