   WASHINGTON -- A growing group of conservative Republican
senators is pushing a capital gains tax plan that would cut
the rate on the sale of assets more deeply than President
Bush's proposal.
   The effort, which is being backed by business lobbyists,
is designed to put pressure on budget negotiators, not only
to include a capital gains tax cut in any deficit-reduction
plan, but to be sure the cut is deep and significant.

   The proposal, sponsored by Sens. Robert Kasten (R., Wis.)
and Connie Mack (R., Fla.), also is a measure of the
confidence of the forces behind a capital gains tax cut that
the levy will be reduced this year.
   "The problem is not one of ultimately getting such a cut,"
the senators said in a letter to their colleagues, "but to
make certain that the reduction is the best possible under
the circumstances." So far, 13 senators, all Republicans,
have agreed to sponsor the legislation. They include Sen.
Phil Gramm (R., Texas), who is a negotiator in the budget
summit.
   The Kasten-Mack plan would cut the capital gains tax rate
to 15% for both individuals and corporations on assets held
for more than one year. The more complicated Bush plan would
give a 19.6% top rate to individuals only on assets held for
longer than three years. The current top capital gains rate
for individuals is as high as 33%.
   Both Republicans and Democrats say a capital gains tax
reduction is likely to be part of any budget-summit agreement
this year that also includes a major tax increase. Budget
talks are continuing, but moving slowly, and haven't yet
seriously broached the question of taxes.
   Supporters of a capital gains tax cut have been concerned
that President Bush might weaken his own capital gains plan
in order to obtain a budget compromise, and are using the
Kasten-Mack package to make their point. The details of the
plan probably won't become law.
   "The capital gains bill out of the summit might be weak
tea," said Mark Bloomfield, president of the American Council
for Capital Formation. "The Kasten-Mack proposal is a healthy
development to try to insure that it is stronger than that."
