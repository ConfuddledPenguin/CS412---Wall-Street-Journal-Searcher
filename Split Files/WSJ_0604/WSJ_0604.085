   TOKYO -- Japanese companies, especially banks, are looking
closely at the possibility of offering securities through
private placements in the U.S., now that the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission has eased disclosure requirements.
   Until recently, many Japanese companies were wary of
offering securities in the U.S. because of SEC rules that
required them to make extensive disclosures of important
financial data. On April 30, however, the U.S. eased those
requirements in an amendment known as Rule 144a.

   The change is aimed at simplifying private placements of
unregistered securities. It allows companies to place
securities with institutional investors whose securities
investments total $100 million or more without making full
financial disclosures. They need only provide the same
materials that they offer to regulators in their home
countries.
   The rule change promises to create a large secondary
market in unregistered securities among big financial
institutions. About 4,000 U.S. investors qualify to trade in
the new, unregistered securities. If the securities are
liquid, or easily traded, companies will have an easier time
selling them and thus will be able to obtain funds more
cheaply through private placements than they can now.
   The maiden test of the new rule came last week -- as the
Swedish industrial and construction equipment maker Atlas
Copco AB completed a 1.3 billion Swedish kronor (US$212
million) equity offering that included a portion placed in
the U.S. under Rule 144a.
   U.S. investment banks now have seized on the new rule to
approach normally secretive Japanese companies with the
possibility of underwriting private placements in the U.S. So
far, says Clive G.N. Galliver, a vice president at CS First
Boston (Japan) Ltd., Japanese companies are studying the
modification with "a great deal of curiosity, but also a
great deal of caution."
   Still, he predicts, "once several transactions have been
done, I think Japanese companies will have the comfort level
to go forward."
   Among the companies most closely studying the possibility
are Japanese banks. Many of them still have to meet tough new
international capital standards that will come into full
effect in 1993. But, with Japan's stock market off sharply in
the first quarter and a resulting temporary suspension of
Euromarket offerings by Japanese concerns, their prospects of
meeting those standards have been clouded. Their shortage of
equity capital already has prompted some banks here to start
curtailing their lending.
   Japanese banks concede the SEC rule modification has added
a new alternative for raising funds and they say they are
willing to take advantage of it. But, with the stock market
still feeble, the market situation itself isn't favorable.
   "Who would be willing to buy them now?" asks a senior
official at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. He also pointed out that the
image of bank stocks in the U.S. isn't very positive.
Mitsubishi is the only Japanese bank to list its stock on
Wall Street, using American Depository Receipts.
   An official at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. says the mood
of American investors will determine whether Japanese banks
go ahead. "Given the current situation, I think Japanese
companies, including banks, want to increase their fund
raising in the Yankee market, but it depends on how American
investors would respond to it," he says.
   The creation of another source of funds for Japanese
companies comes at a crucial time. The plunge in Japanese
share prices early this year brought stocks down as much as a
third from their peak at the end of 1989 and prompted Japan's
securities houses to declare a temporary moratorium on new
equity-linked financings. Sherman S. Abe, another senior
official at CS First Boston here, says Japanese companies
probably won't consider U.S. private placements until that
suspension is lifted. Once they start raising money again,
Japanese companies are likely to seek a lot. Last year,
Japan's major companies raised nearly 25 trillion yen
(US$164.23 billion) of funds through equity sales.
   Companies most likely to place equity in the U.S. are
those with strong growth potential, the kind of companies
American investors like. The regulatory change is "most
attractive to some of the smaller high growth companies . . .
because their fundamental story is exciting," CS First
Boston's Mr. Galliver says.
