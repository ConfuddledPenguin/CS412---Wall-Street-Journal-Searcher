   LONDON -- The packaging and paper company Jefferson
Smurfit Group PLC, Ireland's largest industrial concern, said
it will purchase the corrugated case operations of Cie.
Generale de Papiers S.A. of France for about 235 million
francs ($41 million).
   Smurfit said the planned acquisition, its first in France,
"represents an important step in Smurfit's stated aim of
expansion in Europe." The deal requires approval by the
French company's shareholders.
