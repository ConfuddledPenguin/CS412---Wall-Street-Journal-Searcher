   TOKYO -- Sales of cars, trucks and buses in Japan
increased 6.1% in May from a year earlier, to 444,040 units,
a new record for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers'
Association reported.
   Sales of midsized passenger cars in particular have been
rising, helped by introduction of a 3% consumption tax in
April last year; that tax replaced a heavier commodity tax,
and lowered sticker prices of midsized cars more widely than
those of small-sized cars.

   Among manufacturers, sales of the two largest car makers
in Japan posted healthy increases. Toyota Motor Corp. posted
an 8.4% rise, to 194,199 units. Nissan Motor Co. gained 5.5%
to 103,420 units. Sales by the two makers accounted for 67%
of total sales in May.
   Mitsubishi Motor Corp. sales were up 3.3% at 27,606 units;
while Mazda Motor Corp. sales rose 10.9%, to 36,172 units.
