   Regulators also took over Investors of Florida Savings
Bank, Deerfield Park, Fla., and placed it in receivership.
The thrift had assets of $282.6 million and negative tangible
capital of $1.1 million.
   Both institutions will be run under the direction of the
Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency set up last
year to sell off and liquidate hundreds of failed thrifts.
   Separately, the RTC said it sold the deposits of
Spindletop Savings Association, Beaumont, Texas, to First
City, Texas Beaumont, also of Beaumont. Spindletop Savings
had total assets of $243.9 million and total liabilities of
$352.3 million.
   First City will pay the RTC $10,000 to assume $288.1
million in 9,800 deposit accounts. First City will buy $22.4
million of Spindletop's assets and will have options to
acquire most of the remaining assets.
   The RTC will give First City $271.9 million to back the
deposits and will retain $221.5 million of the assets. The
RTC expects its ultimate cost from the transaction to be
$250.1 million.
