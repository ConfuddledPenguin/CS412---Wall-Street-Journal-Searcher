   NEW YORK -- The technology stock rebound is no fluke, say
a number of analysts who argue that the rally will persist
and perhaps reawaken the broader small-stock market from a
seven-year stupor.
   "My guess is that the technology sector will be the bait"
to lure fund managers back to the shares of smaller
companies, says Elliott L. Schlang, a vice president of
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, Cleveland.

   For May alone, the Nasdaq 100 index of diverse
over-the-counter stocks rose 15.6%. The index includes some
of the large computer and other technology stocks.
   "I think by fall, we'll have enough evidence to say
whether the small-stock rally is for real," adds Preston
Athey of T. Rowe Price Associates' $1 billion New Horizons
Fund. If technology stocks survive the summer without
collapsing, "you could see some real fireworks" by late
autumn.
   Skeptics say they have heard such wishful thinking before,
pointing to rallies in exchange-listed stocks that repeatedly
eluded smaller issues. But market professionals point to some
signs that 1990 may be different.
   "I think there's a very high probability that tech stocks
will continue to outperform the market," says Roger B.
McNamee, manager of the T. Rowe Price Associates Science &amp;
Technology Fund.
   This year's initial quarter was the first quarter since
1983 that the technology group has outperformed the market,
Mr. McNamee says. While he expects the surge to slow in the
typically lethargic summer season, he remains decidedly
upbeat about the group's prospects.
   Over-the-counter technology issues lately have
outperformed not only larger stocks as a group, but also
other OTC stocks. Mr. Athey notes that the Pacific Stock
Exchange index of high-technology issues is up 18.1% this
year. The Nasdaq Industrial Index of 2,789 issues is up
9.86%.
   Technology stocks still look cheap. On average, valuations
of technology issues relative to the S&amp;P 500 are the lowest
in 20 years, according to Mr. McNamee.
   His favorite stocks are leaders in their markets, among
them: Oracle Systems, a maker of regional database software;
Sun Microsystems, a technical workstations maker; Chips &
Technologies, a vendor of chips used in making IBM-compatible
microcomputers; Quantum, a disk-drive manufacturer; Vitalink
Communications, a vendor of networking equipment; and Mentor
Graphics, a maker of engineering and design software systems.
   With normal growth rates of 20% a year or more, technology
companies are much more attractive during periods of sluggish
earnings for larger companies, Mr. McNamee says. He doesn't
expect a significant rebound in the earnings of larger
companies until next year.
   Typically financed more with stock than with debt,
technology companies are less vulnerable to credit squeezes.
That's attractive when many larger companies are facing debt
headaches and uncertain economy.
   "Investors have an incredibly difficult time telling the
difference between which companies have skinned their knees
and those that have shot themselves in the head," Mr. McNamee
says. Investors who can tell the difference can take
advantage of quick sell-offs in stocks with disappointing
news. For instance, Mr. McNamee bought "a ton" of Adobe
Systems shares after that stock dropped 15 1/4 in one day
following bad news. Mr. McNamee says that Adobe is a leader
in its market although its revenue occasionally is
unpredictable.
   Mr. McNamee cautions that with the typical summer slowdown
and normal volatility, technology issues may lose as much as
20% as they ratchet their way higher. But he's optimistic
they will end the year ahead of the market.
   Managers of small-stock funds such as Mr. Athey and Alan
Radlo, manager of the $750 million Fidelity OTC Fund, are
looking for opportunities among companies with steady
earnings growth.
   Mr. Radlo says he's finding opportunities in the oil
service, health care and medical technology fields. He says
he looks for companies with 15% to 20% annual average growth
in earnings, but adds that he's willing to pay 15 times his
estimated 1991 earnings for companies with a 20% to 30%
growth outlook. With independent and major oil companies
spending more money for oil and natural gas exploration,
there's opportunity among oil service companies, he notes. He
likes Oceaneering International, Atwood Oceanics and Cliffs
Drilling, among others.
   Health care stocks are relatively safe in eras of economic
uncertainty, Mr. Radlo adds. He prospects not only among
companies developing products that may be revolutionary, but
also among service-oriented concerns. Among biotechnology
companies, he likes Amgen and Biogen. Applied Bioscience
provides critical drug testing services. Westmark
International makes non-invasive monitoring devices, such as
ultrasound systems.
   As a group, the financial sector isn't as tempting but Mr.
Radlo says he has found attractive banks with increasing
returns on assets and steady or shrinking nonperforming
loans. He likes Bancorp Hawaii, First Security, which
operates in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, U.S. Bancorp in Oregon
and First Commerce in Louisiana. Among insurance companies,
he finds W.R. Berkley of Greenwich, Conn., and Cincinnati
Financial attractive.
   Mr. Schlang of Prescott Ball says investors are finally
recognizing the value he has found all along among smaller
companies with dependable earnings growth.
   The 22 over-the-counter stocks recommended by Mr. Schlang
in his Great Lakes Review newsletter rose an average 30.2%
last year, he says-proof that there's value to be found in
overlooked, smaller companies with steady earnings growth.
Those include Arbor Drugs, Bob Evans Farms, Calgon Carbon,
Chempower, Drug Emporium, Gibson Greetings, Jacobson Stores,
Kimball International, Juno Lighting, Lawson Products, LDI
Corp., Lilly Industrial Coatings, Medstat Systems, Oil Dri
America, Roto-Rooter, RPM Inc., Sanford Corp., Schulman,
Stryker and Tuscarora Plastics.
   Mr. Schlang says he thinks those shares can move even
higher. "The gap between the Dow {Jones Industrial Average}
and the companies I focus on is too broad," he says. "Either
the Dow has to give in," he adds, or the medium-sized
companies have to climb higher.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Over-the-counter stocks rallied Friday in brisk trading.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.16 to 462.13, or 0.7%.
Advancing shares led declining shares by a wide margin, 1,132
to 737, as volume picked up to 168.1 million shares from
157.3 million Thursday.
   Technology stocks remained active.
   Sensormatic Electronics added 1/8 to 14 1/4 and was the
day's most active issue. Seagate rose 1/4 to 15 7/8, Conner
Peripherals advanced 7/8 to 25 5/8, Quantum gained 1/2 to 20
7/8 and Tandon edged up 1/16 to 2 3/4.
   Nike slid 5/8 to 77 7/8, dropping in sympathy with L.A.
Gear, which plunged on the New York Stock Exchange after the
footwear maker released a disappointing earnings outlook.
