   DALLAS -- An Amalgamated Transit Union adviser proposed
that Greyhound Lines Inc. appoint a new management team and
allow striking ATU members to return to work under the old
contract while the union structures an employee buy-out of
the GLI Holding Co. unit.
   In a letter to Greyhound Chairman Fred G. Currey,
investment adviser Brian M. Freeman said ATU employees would
work under the terms of the contract that expired March 1
until the end of the year while the ATU structures an
employee stock ownership plan.

   While offering no specifics on financing, Mr. Freeman said
the plan would be "premised on a long-term labor contract
that assures stability and on mutual agreement on terms for
creditors, stockholders and other stakeholders."
   Mr. Freeman also said that the ATU, which represents 9,400
Greyhound employees, had identified "an experienced team" to
run the company during the interim but didn't give any names.
He suggested that the company declare a moratorium on certain
debt payments to obtain working capital, and that both the
union and the company hold in abeyance their claims against
each other.
   Greyhound officials declined to comment, saying they
hadn't yet received a copy of Mr. Freeman's letter.
Previously, officials at Greyhound, whose stock isn't
publicly traded, have said the company isn't for sale and
that they aren't interested in negotiating with Mr. Freeman.
   Greyhound has had huge losses because of the ATU strike.
In addition to certain lease payments, the company missed a
$9.8 million May 15 interest payment on 13% senior notes due
in 1995. Greyhound, which recently made a tender offer to
redeem about $191 million in face amount of debt for about
$86 million in cash, has said it may file for bankruptcy-law
protection if the company can't complete a financial
restructuring.
