   THE ROBOT'S GLORY days are over.
   Forget that old vision of the factory of the future with
automatons humming away in eerie, unmanned buildings while
they churn out world-beating widgets. U.S. companies have a
new script for the future factory, and robots, while still
having a supporting part in the drama, have lost the lead
role.

   The secret to competitive manufacturing, the new scenario
goes, lies less in heavy automation and more in using
computers to gather information from the factory floor and
swap it with information from every other aspect of a
business -- from the sales department to product engineering
to the shipping docks.
   Consider how Motorola Inc. makes and sells its Bravo
pocket pagers. On May 5, a salesman in Foster City, Calif.,
types an order into his Macintosh computer for 150 black
Bravo pagers, specifies the unique code that will cause each
pager to beep and asks for delivery in two weeks. The order
zips over phone lines to a mainframe computer in a new
factory in Boynton Beach, Fla. The computer automatically
schedules the 150 pagers for production May 15, orders the
proper components, and, on the day after assembly, informs
the shipping docks to express-mail them to Pacific Telesis
Group in California.
   Motorola's two-year-old operation is, in manufacturing
parlance, "computer integrated." Simply put, the factory's
machines and computers speak the same language as the
computers in sales and shipping. The payback: Using mostly
the same type of machines that populate the company's older
factory floors, the Florida facility makes pagers at the same
cost as does Motorola's Singapore plant, which has cheaper
labor but isn't computer integrated. And the domestic plant
can deliver, overnight, custom-built pagers that used to take
nearly six weeks to supply.
   Computer-integrated manufacturing, or CIM, is increasingly
the U.S. manufacturer's mantra. Most manufacturers have
appointed CIM managers. A $35 billion-a-year industry has
sprung up to supply CIM equipment and software, according to
Advanced Manufacturing Research, a Cambridge, Mass., research
firm.
   No wonder. CIM dangles the promise of a comeback for
American manufacturers, who for a decade have been criticized
as being inept. And it does so at a relatively small cost.
CIM demands innovations that are heavy on software and
networking technology, where the U.S. is strong, and light on
robots and machines, where Japan is stronger. "If we get our
act together," says Jerry McCracken, manager of industrial
programs at San Francisco's Bechtel Group Inc., "this is one
of the few areas left where we can get our competitive
advantage."
   But getting it together may be a tall order. More a
philosophy than a technology, CIM (pronounced sim) requires a
company to break down barriers between departments, to
streamline with quality control and just-in-time
manufacturing, and to give every machine and employee the
ability to talk with each other and "watch" a product as it
moves through the entire corporate pipeline. "CIM is a
cultural change: People that over the years have learned to
work separately need to find ways to work together again,"
says Rody Salas, senior vice president of Allen-Bradley Co.
"The computer is being used as a tool that allows you to
integrate these functions that have been separated over the
years."
   The academics, manufacturing executives, vendors and
consultants who support CIM dissociate themselves from
America's automation fetish in the 1970s and 1980s, when
doomsayers warned of a robot gap with Japan and companies
spent billions of dollars to replace humans with machines.
Those robots were meant to cut labor costs; CIM's main goal
is to improve competitiveness by cutting the time it takes to
turn ideas into products and to get existing products to
market. "The idea is to cut cycle time so you can catch the
crest of the wave" of demand, says CIM-systems manager Keith
Turner of Levi Strauss &amp; Co., "rather than following behind
and picking up the pieces."
   One trouble with robots is that although they are great in
factories that churn out masses of a single product, they are
of less use in today's "flexible manufacturing" facilities.
Such a flexible factory is Apple Computer Inc.'s new
Macintosh plant in Fremont, Calif., which uses little
automation equipment but can assemble four different Mac
models at one time. By using CIM to tie the factory's
computers into sales and delivery systems, Apple plans to
switch to what it calls "build to order," which allows the
company to make only what customers have requested and
eliminate the need for large inventories.
   Another problem with robots was that they often merely
took over the same inefficient tasks that humans had
previously performed on poorly run assembly lines. What's
more, companies tended to create "islands of automation" that
affected only specific tasks. That meant a design computer
here, an assembly robot or testing machine there, maybe a
bar-code reader at the shipping bay. But these "islands"
didn't share information about where a product was in the
pipeline.
   That's what Federal-Mogul Corp. found last year when it
took a hard look at its oilseal factories. The Southfield,
Mich., autoparts company was getting battered by U.S. and
foreign rivals that could develop new seals in under 10
weeks; it took Federal nearly 18. In April 1989, Federal
hired Ernst &amp; Young, the consulting firm, to find out why.
   The firm found chaos under a veneer of automation. Federal
had invested heavily in automation, but departments were run
as fiefdoms whose employees barely communicated and whose
machines didn't understand each other's data. After a
salesman sent in an order for a new seal, the paper work
typically spent weeks unnoticed on an engineer's desk.
Blueprints sat for weeks more in manufacturing. And salesmen,
ill informed of the factories' capabilities, often would
agree to sell a part that was impossible to make, causing
costly delays. Federal "was a traditional hierarchical
manufacturing organization," says Lawrence Smith, Federal's
manager for technical services. "We saw that if it continued,
the seal group would be out of business."
   Ernst &amp; Young prescribed a heavy dose of CIM that stripped
divisions of their autonomy and reorganized them into
"business-unit teams." The teams -- comprising salesmen,
distribution experts, and engineers from manufacturing,
testing and product design -- had to see a product through
from order to delivery. Federal bought software to connect
its islands of automation, tying together its work stations,
personal computers and milling machines.
   Now a salesman taps into a computer that will quickly tell
him whether the part can be built and how much a new seal
will cost. The system schedules the part for manufacture or
sends new-part dimensions to a design computer, which
generates electronic blueprints that flow directly into
factory machines. Without introducing a single new robot,
Federal trimmed to 20 days the average time it takes to turn
around a new product; in urgent cases it can do it in three
days. And the cost was only "several million dollars,"
Federal says, because relatively little capital investment
was involved.
   Military spending cuts and fierce competition for fewer
defense contracts were what spurred McDonnell Douglas Corp.
to spend $10 million to begin introducing CIM to a Florida
missile factory in 1989. Tomahawk missiles once traveled
through the plant accompanied by a two-inch-thick manual. The
company installed computer systems that automatically
schedule manufacturing tasks, keep track of labor, and send
instructions to computer screens at work stations along the
assembly line, thus doing away with paper. Workers have time
to do 30% more work now that they don't shuffle paper, says
Walter Kurgas, deputy director of the Tomahawk operation.
   Results like these are spurring a broad range of
industries to consider CIM. Bechtel, for instance, has helped
introduce CIM in a British potato-chip company, in Egypt's
state petroleum works and in a California jail, where
automated carts deliver food and laundry. Early CIM converts
-- McDonnell Douglas, Hewlett-Packard Co., Digital Equipment
Corp. and Allen-Bradley, to name a few -- are doing a brisk
business selling the know-how they've acquired to CIM
neophytes.
   Still, CIM is tall on talk but short on reality. On close
inspection, most companies are implementing only pieces of
CIM. Motorola's pager plant, for example, hasn't yet tied
information from the factory into an accounting system. Only
11% of the manufacturers in a recent Ernst &amp; Young survey
rated themselves as "high-level users" of CIM.
   And technological roadblocks sometimes remain. Levi's,
which wants to integrate most aspects of its business by
1992, has found gaps that defy integration by computers.
Fashion designers can use computers to create new fashions,
but pattern makers must still take those concepts and
manually cut patterns that are then converted to computer
code and sent to cutting machines on the factory floor.
   Technology, however, isn't the real problem. In a survey
of Fortune 500 manufacturers by Advanced Manufacturing
Research, 70% of the respondents said that people were the
main stumbling block to integrating manufacturing; only 9%
cited technological snafus.
   At McDonnell's missile plant, for instance, the accounting
department has been reluctant to accept computer-generated
accounts of how much labor was spent making a missile, says
Mr. Kurgas. Under the current system, a worker fills out a
time card by hand and mails it to labor accounting, where
someone checks it for errors and then punches the data into
that department's computer. Under the proposed system, a
computer would read a code on a worker's employee badge,
record the worker's time and send it directly to the
labor-accounting computer. Accounting-department employees
"are reluctant to change what they currently have until you
systematically prove to them it does at least as well," Mr.
Kurgas says. "There develops a consistent and considerable
roadblock until you prove what you set out to do."
   Another people problem for CIM companies: Suppliers must
be let into the integration game so they can automatically
keep tabs on what parts the manufacturer needs when. Although
fraternal ties with vendors have been common for decades in
Japan, U.S. companies "tend to regard the supplier as their
enemy," says Terry Ozan, national director of manufacturing
services at Ernst &amp; Young.
   Changing that view is tough, as DEC found last year when
it began a program of sharing its CIM expertise with its
suppliers. Its aim was to help them refine quality and create
more reliable delivery schedules to match DEC's demand for
just-in-time deliveries at its disk-drive plan. For decades,
executives have been told to keep suppliers at arm's length,
the better to squeeze them for lower prices and to keep them
from leaking secrets. But, says Walter Bonin, a DEC planning
manager, suddenly the company is supposed to do a turnabout
and condone sharing of production information and technology
with suppliers. "Flags have been raised in the legal
department" and in the purchasing department, he says.
   For defense contractors, the Pentagon is a party to be
reckoned with. It is pressing McDonnell and other contractors
to develop CIM systems that allow the Defense Department to
"watch" a missile go through the entire manufacturing process
to ensure that contractual requirements are being met. The
department "also wants to look through us to our major
contractors with same visibility," says Mr. Kurgas.
   Making these and other changes is wrenching for many
companies, and CIM believers concede that theirs is a
yearslong pilgrimage. Their ultimate goal is an elusive
nirvana called computer-integrated enterprise, or CIE. That
means that a company must reach beyond manufacturing to hook
together sales, factories, shipping, procurement, accounting
and even outside suppliers into one gregarious computerized
family. "We talk about the CIM journey," says Keith Glick,
manager of engineering at DEC's disk-drive factory in
Colorado Springs, Colo. "It's the journey to enterprise
integration."
   Can most companies successfully reach that destination?
Mr. Turner, Levi's CIM manager, acknowledges that problems
lie ahead. "The biggest drawback to CIM," he says, "is that
you're searching for the Holy Grail. You may never find it."
