   Schools Should Be Totally Free Market

   John E. Chubb's proposal for reorganizing the delivery of
public education to incorporate the choice and incentives of
free markets ("A Blueprint for Public Education," editorial
page, June 6) is almost identical to Milton Friedman's famous
1962 voucher proposal. Unfortunately, Mr. Chubb does not
fully bite the free-market bullet. In his scheme, parents
would not be allowed to supplement the voucher amount
received from the government agency. Mr. Chubb is worried
that allowing supplementation would produce "too many
inequalities within the system." However, this result is not
at all obvious, and it may even be that inequality would be
less with supplementation.
   The liberal establishment notwithstanding, many low- and
moderate-income families feel so strongly about education
that they would want to supplement the voucher amount if it
would mean a higher-quality education for their children. The
choices of these families would help to reduce inequality in
educational opportunity. Some parents from higher-income
levels would also supplement, mostly to keep their children
in the private schools they are already attending.

   Of course some of these families might react to the
voucher and supplementation by moving their children to an
even-higher-quality school, tending to cancel out the
reduction in inequality just noted. However, the way to
handle this problem would be to make the amount of the
voucher vary inversely with income. The ability of upwardly
mobile families with low incomes to upgrade their children's
education would become more nearly equal to that of families
with higher incomes.
   But even if allowing supplementation would increase the
amount of educational inequality somewhat, is this any reason
to deny some low-income families the opportunity to improve
their children's life chances by dint of their hard work and
saving? Other than this flaw, Mr. Chubb's plan is a
commendable one. Why seriously diminish its effectiveness
because of a misdirected concern about inequality? I am sure
that a poll of the poor would find them favoring
supplementation.

   Mr. Chubb uses good logic -- except for one very glaring
omission: Nothing was said about the right all effective
schools should have (and private schools have always had) to
expel students for various academically related or moral
causes and without fear of being charged in such cases with
racial discrimination.
   If students are to be motivated for effective study, they
should not be allowed to view education as a right; they must
see it as a privilege. Each "average" student, thanks to his
school experience, should realize that it is an
accomplishment just to be able to stay in his school; he is
therefore motivated toward this end -- with good study
habits, a cooperative attitude, etc. Without this power for
schools, Mr. Chubb's logic merely rearranges the failed
liberal philosophy and bureaucracy in education -- somewhat
like blowing the dust on a table instead of actually removing
it.

   Mr. Chubb rightly identifies government as the "cause {of
many of} the schools' problems in the first place." It is
interesting that he then suggests a complex, governmentally
administered funding and organizational scheme as the
solution.
   The root problem in government's involvement in education
is the notion that wise public officials can appropriate our
money and decide better than we how to spend it. Socialism
has failed for a lack of just these wise officials.
   As one already overburdened by a senseless educational
bureaucracy, I suggest we leave the resources and
decisionmaking at the local or regional level. It is the
communities' right and duty to define and meet their own
educational needs.

   Mr. Chubb and Polly Williams ("Teachers vs. Kids,"
editorial, June 6) are both right: The government is the
problem in our education system. But as radical as their
ideas may seem to some, they don't go far enough. A
school-voucher or "choice" system still leaves the state in
control -- tax money will continue to be taken from citizens
and "scholarship" amounts or vouchers "given" to each child
in a more or less arbitrary way.
   We all grew up with an existing public-education system,
and its justification is deeply ingrained in the American way
of thinking: Everyone agrees that literacy is crucial.
However, we must recognize that education (the transfer of
knowledge) is a service, subject to the same economic
principles that govern the market of any other commodity or
service; there are suppliers (schools, teachers, book
publishers) and customers (children and parents); the service
delivered has a cost (salaries, school maintenance,
materials) and a price (tuition); and suppliers must have an
organization that, if run efficiently, will generate a profit
(meaning the benefit to the customers will be greater than
the costs incurred in providing that service).
   So, why keep this important service under government
control and not open it up to the self-regulating
efficiencies of the free market? Why not let entrepreneurs
invest in a business (schools) and allow them to offer a
specific service (curriculum) at a certain price (tuition)?
Competition and free enterprise will result in the most
efficient allocation of resources, and the customers
(students) will get the best service for the lowest cost to
society.
   However, the issue is not that the current system is
inefficient (which it is); the real issue is the principle
that the government does not have the moral right to dictate
to individuals how or what they should be taught, and it
should not be in the "education business." Only when this
idea takes root in the American spirit and the
public-education system is totally dismantled will we achieve
a sound, self-regulating and efficient education system.

   Mr. Chubb's proposal gets this parent and taxpayer's
support. It addresses several of my greatest concerns about
the educational system. As a parent who has lived through two
teachers' strikes, a year with a tenured teacher who was less
than productive, and three failed school bonds in the state
of Ohio, and who was educated in the state of Mississippi
during the 1950s and '60s when nepotism and discrimination
were creating educational disaster for the state, I will
endorse any measure that restores control to the consumers of
education: parents and students.
   With current technology, schools no longer need to be
large and rigid. Mr. Chubb's proposal for reduced control and
restrictions would help generate community alternatives that
haven't existed since the consolidations of the early 1950s.
Loss of community schools had many consequences. They once
served as meeting places for public debate, where parents
could meet with teachers in a non-threatening environment and
establish common goals and agendas.
