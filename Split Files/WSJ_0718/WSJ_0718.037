   International Business Machines Corp. is considering the
sale of low-technology businesses, such as electric
typewriters and keyboards, in a buy-out that could total
about $3 billion, Wall Street and industry executives said.
   The possible sale of the businesses is the latest sign of
a new urgency among IBM executives to make each business
stand on its own to strengthen the company's financial
performance.

   As part of a cost-cutting campaign, the computer giant has
been looking for ways to get out of marginal businesses and
has simply decided that it can't make some of these
low-profit-margin items as inexpensively as its competitors
can, the executives said. In addition, these businesses are
no longer central to IBM. While electric typewriters, for
example, were once a mainstay of IBM's office equipment
business, they were supplanted in the 1980s by the
proliferation of desktop computers and other word processing
systems.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, IBM closed at $120.75, down $1.625.
   In Armonk, N.Y., an IBM spokesman declined to comment. The
industry executives cautioned that many details remain to be
worked out before a sale can be completed. Still, they said
that IBM is talking with a potential buyer, and that an
agreement may be announced by the end of this month. The
possible buyer's identity couldn't be confirmed.
   The current plan provides for a leveraged buy-out, with
some employees getting equity -- an arrangement that, while
commonplace in the 1980s, would be unusual for a business
owned by IBM.
   A leveraged buy-out also would raise some troubling issues
for IBM, because such transactions are sometimes followed by
layoffs to cut costs and help enable the acquirer to repay
the debt used in the purchase. Yet a key tenet of IBM's
culture is a tradition of no layoffs. When IBM has sold
businesses in the past, it has tried to allay employee fears
on that subject, and IBM's concerns about employee morale are
apparently part of what remains to be worked out.
   Besides typewriters and keyboards, the computer industry
executives said, the sale also could involve low-end
printers. All three products are made at IBM's plant in
Lexington, Ky. The number of employees there wasn't
available. IBM has already turned over much of its typewriter
marketing and service to other companies. It also backed away
from a similar business, copiers, by selling most of the
operations to Eastman Kodak Co. two years ago.
   The move would be embarrassing for IBM, because it spent
several hundred million dollars a few years ago to modernize
and automate the Lexington facility, and touted it as an
example of how a U.S. manufacturing facility could compete
with the Japanese.
   Still, IBM executives have indicated they will bite the
bullet, if they must, to cut costs. In the fourth quarter,
IBM took a $2.4 billion charge to cover a reduction of 10,000
jobs and some plant consolidations. It also has been pruning
operations where possible; just last week, it said it was
selling its automated teller machine operations into a joint
venture with Diebold Inc., after capturing only about 5% of
the worldwide market.
   A Wall Street source said IBM is being advised on the sale
by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the securities unit of
American Express Co. Advisers for the potential buyer are
believed to include the investment banking unit of J.P.
Morgan &amp; Co., as well as the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit of
General Electric Co.
   Executives of Shearson, Morgan and Kidder all declined to
comment.
   Any sale of these typewriter, keyboard or printer
businesses would underscore IBM's intention to get out of
marginal businesses, because, while IBM has sold assets it
built up in ventures with other companies, it rarely parts
with home-grown businesses such as these.
   IBM's business as a whole has performed better than
expected this year, with earnings up 6.8% in the first half
to $2.45 billion, or $4.26 a share, on a revenue rise of 9.8%
to $30.68 billion. But IBM isn't out of the woods yet.
   Sales of mainframes declined in the second quarter, and
IBM must manage a ticklish transition late this year and next
year, as it moves to a new generation of mainframes that the
company is expected to announce this fall. Customers often
stop buying products while they pause to evaluate new ones,
creating an awkward slowdown in sales.
   IBM's mainframe competitors also have been taking market
share away from the company in the past couple of years, and
some industry executives worry that the new generation of
machines expected from Amdahl Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. may
accelerate that erosion of market share. Mainframes account
for roughly half of IBM's sales and nearly two-thirds of its
earnings, so any problems in that area would ripple through
IBM's business.
   Even while announcing solid earnings on Monday, IBM
Chairman John Akers cautioned in a statement that "much
remains to be done this year."
