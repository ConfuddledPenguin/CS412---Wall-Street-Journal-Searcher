   The name of God is often invoked in court, but now a court
may have to decide what God's name is.
   Fittingly, the venue will be religious. The Judicial
Council, high court of the United Methodist Church, has
agreed to hear arguments this fall on whether some church
members -- those who prefer not to think in terms of a
masculine deity -- can be excused from addressing or
referring to God as "Father" in church prayers.

   For America's nearly nine million Methodists, the issue is
a pressing one. That's because their church is now deep into
the revision of its official "Book of Worship," which sets
forth details of Sunday morning prayers and rituals.
   But the committee doing the updating is deadlocked on
whether to amend prayers to include alternative "nongender"
terms that would be placed in parentheses following
references to God as Father. For example, "almighty God"
could be substituted for "almighty Father," while "Father,
Son and Holy Spirit" could be replaced by "Creator, Redeemer
and Sustainer." Each congregation would be allowed to make
its own choice.
   And that would be dangerous, warns the Rev. Ole Borgen, a
retired bishop in Wilmore, Ky., who is a committee member.
"It's not an incidental thing that God is called Father" in
the Bible, he says. If that language is altered, "then we
begin to form God in our own image."
   But Bishop Susan M. Morrison of Philadelphia, who heads
the committee, says "many images of God" are appropriate in a
culturally diverse denomination like the Methodists. She
acknowledges that a recent survey found that most Methodists
want no change in the church's masculine imagery for God.
However, a majority of those polled were over 55 years old.
   "Are we writing a book for people who have been in our
church for years and, of course, should be heard?" asks
Bishop Morrison. "Or are we writing a book for future
generations?"
   The Judicial Council -- composed of five lawyers and four
ministers -- is scheduled to meet Oct. 24 in Denver and is
expected to rule within days.
   The last time the Methodists tinkered with tradition, the
issue never made it to the court. That was in 1986, when a
committee revising the church hymnal voted to drop the old
favorite "Onward, Christian Soldiers." About 11,000 people
wrote to protest, and the hymn soldiered on.
