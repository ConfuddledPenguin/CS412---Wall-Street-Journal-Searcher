   STAMFORD, Conn. -- As Xerox Corp. re-examines its foray
into financial services, all options remain open, including
complete withdrawal from the business, Xerox's top two
executives indicated in interviews.
   Although they stressed that no final decisions have been
made, the executives said Xerox will leave any
financial-services segment that doesn't promise an average
annual return on equity of at least 15%. They don't yet know
how many segments -- if any -- will make the cut.

   "There aren't any sacred cows," said Xerox President Paul
Allaire, who will become chief executive officer Aug. 1.
"Everything we do is to make money. If a business doesn't
make money now, and doesn't have a game plan to make money,
then we won't invest in it."
   In 1989, Xerox's insurance and financial operations --
excluding Xerox Credit Corp., which finances the company's
office-equipment sales -- returned 12.4% on equity. That
matches the 12.4% return on assets reported by Xerox's $12.4
billion-a-year office-equipment arm, but the two sectors have
been moving in opposite directions.
   "That probably means financial services will be smaller,"
said Mr. Allaire. "But anything we have left will be
profitable."
   Mr. Allaire's comments, coupled with similar remarks from
David Kearns, Xerox's chairman and current chief executive,
underline the speed with which Xerox is backing away from its
$5.2 billion-a-year financial-services business, once seen as
the antidote to a faltering office-equipment operation.
   Battered by efficient Japanese competitors, Xerox's share
of its bread-and-butter U.S. plain-paper copier market -- a
market it invented -- dropped to an all-time low of 8.5% in
1985. But the company has climbed steadily back since then,
reaching a 15.2% share in 1989, according to Dataquest Inc.
   Now Xerox is poised to bet its future on a multifunction
machine that would combine copying, printing, scanning and
facsimile by treating documents as electronic data rather
than transitory images. That device will lead to a rebirth of
Xerox as "the document company," said Messrs. Allaire and
Kearns.
   Still, both men said they won't be pressured into haste by
Wall Street analysts, who have been pushing for an exit from
financial services for some time. They said that given the
current depressed market for financial-service businesses,
cost-cutting and shrinkage may be better shortterm options.
"We aren't going to do anything dumb or precipitous," said
Mr. Kearns.
   Analysts were pleased but cautious. "The mere fact that
they're extremely interested in de-emphasizing financial
services will be viewed very positively," said Eugene Glazer
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "But that's just the first part
of the equation."
   Xerox has already started disengaging from several
finance-related businesses. In April it walked away from its
investments in troubled VMS Realty Partners, a Chicago real
estate concern, taking a $375 million charge. The company's
Crum &amp; Forster Inc. unit stopped writing personal lines of
insurance, and in May Xerox put much of its third-party
financing and leasing operation on the block.
   Messrs. Allaire and Kearns said such paring of
financial-services activity will continue. And they promised
there won't be any money from Xerox's revitalized
office-equipment area used to prop up financial services.
