   MANITOWOC Co. (Manitowoc, Wis.) -- Fred M. Butler, former
senior vice president and chief operating officer, was named
president and chief executive officer. Mr. Butler, 55 years
old, succeeds P. Ralph Helm, who will continue as chairman.
Manitowoc is a crane and ice machine manufacturer and ship
repairer. Mr. Helm, 64, is relinquishing his other positions
to focus on developing a new line of cranes before his
retirement, the company said. Manitowoc said G. Michael
Decker, senior vice president and chief financial officer,
and Jeffrey R. Cooke, senior vice president of
administration, have resigned "because of philosophical
differences as to the long-range strategy of the company."
The company said that Messrs. Decker and Cooke resigned in
response to the company's decision to develop the new line of
cranes. "They felt that there shouldn't be any new line, but
the board agreed with myself and the chairman that there
should," Mr. Butler said. The two executives who resigned
weren't available for comment.
