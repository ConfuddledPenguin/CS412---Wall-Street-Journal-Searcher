   NEW YORK -- Insiders at Hewlett-Packard Co. sold $5.6
million of the company's shares between mid-May and mid-June,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   In total, 17 executives and one director trimmed their
holdings by 118,275 shares, the filings show. Altogether, the
sales represented 9% of total officer holdings in the Palo
Alto, Calif., computer company.

   The wave of selling began May 16, the day the company
reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, prompting a
6% drop in the price of Hewlett-Packard stock over the next
two days. May 16 also was the day that some insiders were
freed to sell shares granted to them in 1985, said Ann
Baskins, assistant secretary.
   Five years ago "our board approved some significant gifts
{of stock} to the top people in the company," but sales of
the shares were restricted until May 1990, she said. In
addition to the open-market sales, insiders "surrendered to
the company" 69,000 shares to pay taxes on the 1985 stock
grant, she said. The surrenders trimmed insider holdings by
6%.
   The insiders sold at an average price of $47.34 a share,
SEC filings show. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Hewlett-Packard shares closed at $47.875,
up 12.5 cents.
   The largest sale was by David W. Packard, a director and
son of the company's chairman. He sold 21,060 shares June 12
at $48.63 a share; he retains 559,539 shares, SEC filings
show. Executive Vice President Richard Alberding sold 17,500
shares, 30% of his total holdings. Mr. Alberding declined to
comment; Mr. Packard couldn't be reached for comment. The
other insiders sold between 181 and 14,960 shares.

   THE GOOD BOOK: Two insiders at Bible publisher Thomas
Nelson Inc. purchased 134,510 shares in June for over $1
million, SEC filings show.
   They paid about $7.50 a share, according to the filings.
In trading on the over-the-counter market, Thomas Nelson
shares closed yesterday at $8.50, down 12.5 cents.
   Sam Z. Moore, president of the Nashville, Tenn., company,
bought 42,846 common shares and 14,816 Class B shares June
20. The private purchases increased his holdings, according
to the company, to 1,037,085 shares. He couldn't be reached
for comment.
   Brownlee O. Currey Jr., a Nelson director who is chairman
of the Nashville Banner newspaper, privately purchased 76,848
common shares the same day, raising his stake to 100,000
shares. Mr. Currey said he sees Nelson as in a turnaround
position. In the mid-1980s, the company diversified into the
cookbook and greeting card businesses, and "they didn't work
out the way we hoped," he said. The company reported losses
for fiscal 1985 and 1986.
   But in the fiscal year ended March 31, earnings were 60
cents a share, compared with 46 cents a year earlier, on a
20% revenue gain. The firm has returned to its "main business
-- the Bible business," said Mr. Currey.

   CHART TOPPER: The largest purchase in this week's Insider
Trading Spotlight chart was part of a previously reported
increase in the amount of Kollmorgen Corp. stock held by a
group including Tinicum Inc. The group raised its stake in
Kollmorgen, a Simsbury, Conn., manufacturer of motors and
electro-optical systems, with open-market purchases of
707,100 shares between May 11 and June 12, SEC filings
disclosed earlier.
   Now, separate SEC reports show that 378,807 of those
shares were purchased by Eric Ruttenberg, a Kollmorgen
director and a principal in Tinicum, a New York investment
group. Mr. Ruttenberg, who paid $4.2 million for the shares,
said he bought them on behalf of Tinicum because "we like the
company."
   Kollmorgen stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange at $12.125, down 25 cents.
