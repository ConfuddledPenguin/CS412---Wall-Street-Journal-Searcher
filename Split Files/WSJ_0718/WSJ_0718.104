   WASHINGTON -- The Senate, seeking a tougher U.S. stance in
multilateral trade negotiations, voted overwhelmingly to
subject imported textiles, apparel and footwear to a highly
restrictive system of global quotas.
   The measure would effectively scrap the 38 bilateral
textile and apparel accords that the U.S. has negotiated
recently with its trading partners and sharply reduce the
growth of such imports, except those from Canada and Israel,
to 1% a year. The volume of these imports has been growing at
an average of 3.5% annually in recent years.

   The bill was approved on a 68-32 vote, the largest
majority the Senate has given a textile-quota bill in recent
history. Similar legislation passed by 60-39 in 1985 and by
59-36 in 1988, and was vetoed by former President Reagan.
President Bush said he opposes the Senate bill, and U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills said she would recommend a
veto of the bill. If the president did veto the legislation,
Senate aides said that some of the senators who voted for it
would switch sides in an override attempt.
   However, the bill's sponsors acknowledged in more than two
days of debate that their real purpose was to keep pressure
on Mrs. Hills in the current round of negotiations under the
auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The
sponsors fear that Mrs. Hills will allow greater access to
the U.S. textile market in exchange for other trade benefits
the U.S. is seeking in the multilateral talks.
   "Don't leave us hanging out to dry," pleaded Sen. Jesse
Helms (R., N.C.), one of the bill's champions.
   Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking Republican of the
Senate Finance Committee, called the bill a "turkey," and
Sen. Slade Gorton (R., Wash.) twice tried to gut it through
amendments. But the still-powerful Senate textile caucus
headed by Sens. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and Strom Thurmond
(R., S.C.) fought off all attempts to thwart the bill's
purpose by sizable margins.
   In the House, the bill's fate is uncertain. Rep. Marilyn
Lloyd (D., Tenn.), who heads the House textile caucus, has
mustered nearly 250 co-sponsors for the measure. But the
caucus admits to some difficulty in getting the bill cleared
by the Ways and Means Committee's International Trade
subcommittee before the August recess. They acknowledge that
neither subcommittee Chairman Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.) nor Ways
and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) supports the
bill.
