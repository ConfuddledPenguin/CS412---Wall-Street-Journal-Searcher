   WASHINGTON -- A congressional report warned that
technological innovation in the world's securities markets
"could outpace the capability of market participants to
comprehend and control its effects."
   The report by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment, entitled "Trading Around the Clock," also said,
however, that technological innovation "could contribute to
sustained liquidity and expansion." While the study
acknowledges that government involvement in U.S. markets is
controversial, it recommends that "at a minimum,
encouragement, facilitation and leadership from government
will be needed," particularly in the area of setting
standards for information technology.

   The report, by Congress's technological arm, attempts to
outline questions facing the securities markets as they grow
increasingly international.
   The study contends that Congress may have to "articulate a
clear statement of the national interest for the guidance of
regulators." It cautions that market players often use the
market with the most lenient structure for trading and
contends that "one need is to prevent the erosion of the
framework of prudential regulation that Congress has erected
since 1934."
   It adds that U.S. regulators may need to "actively
encourage market officials to take a long-term view of market
development, and U.S. regulators themselves may have to be
encouraged to do so by the U.S. Congress."
