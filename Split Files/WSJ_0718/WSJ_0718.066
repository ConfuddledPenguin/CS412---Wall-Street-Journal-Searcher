   MINNEAPOLIS -- Honeywell Inc., benefiting from a
restructuring effort and a favorable tax ruling, reported
stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter results.
   The maker of control systems had net income of $99.1
million, or $2.58 a share, up 32% from $74.8 million, or
$1.73 a share, the year earlier. Profit from continuing
operations climbed 54% to $92.4 million, or $2.40 a share,
from $60 million, or $1.39 a share. Sales rose 2.1% to $1.55
billion from $1.52 billion.

   Honeywell said its "continued solid performance" reflects
the "benefits of our profit-improvement plan and continued
strong market conditions" for its industrial and
commercial-flight systems.
   New tax regulations reduced the tax the company must pay
on the earlier sale of a portion of its stake in a Japanese
joint venture. The company said it had been projecting a 37%
tax rate for 1990; as a result of the ruling, it lowered that
projection to 30%. The adjustment allowed the company to pay
a tax rate of just 22%. Earnings would have been $1.96 a
share without benefit of the tax break.
   Martin Sankey, First Boston Corp. analyst, noted that
Honeywell's earnings were "operationally, modestly stronger
than expectations" on Wall Street but that the tax advantages
were more of a surprise.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Honeywell shares jumped $3.50 to close at $110.50.
   For more than a year, Honeywell has been streamlining
operations as part of a program to boost profitability. It is
pursuing plans to spin off its defense business and has
trimmed its work force. One effect of the restructuring has
been to reduce interest expense, which in the latest period
fell 18% to $28.9 million.
   Honeywell's industrial business showed a sharp increase in
profitability, as continuing strength in industrial
automation systems -- process control systems used in
factories -- more than offset softer markets for the
industrial-parts business. Pretax earnings for the segment
rose to $60.5 million from $46.1 million.
   The company's space and aviation business, which includes
commercial flight systems, military avionics and space
systems, showed an even stronger upturn, with pretax profit
increasing to $52 million from $29 million.
   Honeywell noted that orders for the segment, excluding
results from units disposed of since last year, "were down
moderately," largely on a downturn in orders for space
systems.
   Weakness in U.S. residential building contributed to a
decline in pretax earnings at the homes and buildings
operation to $41.9 million from $42.8 million.
