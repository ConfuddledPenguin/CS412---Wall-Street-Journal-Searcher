   Where Does the Real Danger Lie for Fund Investors?

   Many investors consider a mutual fund risky if its share
price zigzags wildly. This is why so many investors avoid
stock funds and instead leave their money in money market
funds and bond funds. But specialists warn that the really
worrisome risk isn't volatility, but inflation.
   "If you're 40 years old and investing for your retirement,
then investing in fixed-income funds is a much riskier
approach," Kenneth Gregory, who runs a San Francisco
investment advisory firm, Litman/Gregory &amp; Co., says. "By the
time inflation and taxes are taken into account, the chances
of beating inflation are much lower" than with stock funds.

   At first blush, Vanguard Money Market Reserve -- Prime
Portfolio seems like a safe investment. The fund has never
had a down quarter. In the past 15 years, the fund's worst
return for any of the 60 quarters was 1%.
   Twentieth Century Select, on the other hand, is the sort
of fund that can leave investors lying awake at night. This
growth-stock fund posted losses in 17 of the past 60
quarterly periods. In the 1987 fourth quarter, which included
the Oct. 19 stock market crash, it got pounded for a 23%
loss.
   Compared with Vanguard Prime Portfolio, Twentieth Century
Select is the riskier investment, right? If risk is equated
with wild price fluctuations, this certainly is true.
   But if risk is defined instead as preserving capital
against the ravages of inflation and Uncle Sam, then Vanguard
Prime Portfolio turns out to be a real loser. In the past 15
years, the Vanguard Prime Portfolio money market fund posted
an average annualized return of 9.1%, barely ahead of the
6.1% annualized inflation rate. Deduct taxes, and the
money-fund investor made hardly any money at all. By
contrast, Twentieth Century Select posted an annual return of
23.1% over the past 15 years, easily outpacing both inflation
and the tax man.
   Though most stock funds have posted some atrocious
quarterly and 12-month returns in the past 15 years, the
results look far more respectable if an investor stuck it out
for at least three years. "The longer the period, the more
the odds are in your favor," say Mr. Gregory, who, in
addition to his investment counseling business, writes a
mutual fund newsletter, the L/G No-Load Fund Analyst.
   Investors have known for years that some investments are
more volatile than others. But the debate about risk took on
a sharper focus in the 1970s, when the so-called betas became
a favorite Wall Street investment concept.
   A beta measures a stock or stock fund's volatility
relative to the stock market, as measured by the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index. The S&amp;P 500 has a beta of 1.
Twentieth Century Select, which is more volatile than the S&amp;P
500, has a beta of 1.3. A low-risk fund such as Vanguard's
Wellington Fund, which holds both stocks and bonds, has a
beta of 0.74.
   "People look at our funds and say they're too volatile,
based on our betas," Robert Puff, a member of Twentieth
Century's five-man stock-picking team, says. "But common
stocks are not meant to be short-term investment vehicles.
People should think about stocks the same way they think
about their home."
   Part of the problem, Mr. Puff says, is that many investors
buy stock funds near market peaks, and then don't have the
patience to hang on through a market slump. "One of the major
determinants of a mutual fund investor's success is totally
outside the control of the mutual fund company, and that's
the decision of when to invest," he says. "The biggest risk
is putting all of their money to work at the peak of the
market."
   One way to avoid this problem, Mr. Puff says, is to use
dollar cost averaging, investing fixed amounts at regular
intervals, regardless of what is happening in Neff's Windsor
Fund, both of which have good long-term records but poor
recent performance. The two funds are closed to new
investors. Investors who want to invest with Michael Price
can buy Mutual Beacon, which has been managed by Mr. Price
since 1985. One drawback: It has a steep $50,000 minimum.
   John Neff's talents are available through a publicly
traded dual-purpose fund called Gemini II. Gemini II has two
classes of shares outstanding, income shares and capital
shares, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
can be bought and sold just as any other stock. The income
shares get all the dividends kicked off by the fund, while
the capital shares pick up all the capital gains. Taken
together, the two classes of shares are trading at a minute
discount to the value of the fund's portfolio.

   Over the past 15 years, some top-performing stock funds
have produced dismall short-term results. But those investors
who hung on through the rough patches ended up with decent
long-term performance.
