   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein turned his threatening
rhetoric away from Israel and toward neighboring Persian Gulf
nations, threatening to use force if they continue driving
down the price of oil by exceeding production quotas.
   Speaking on Iraqi television, Mr. Hussein said some gulf
leaders had been "inspired by America" to take part in a plot
to depress Arab oil revenues.

   "Raising our voice against the evil is not the final
resort if the evil continues," he said. "There should be some
effective act to bring back things to their right place. . .
. Iraqis will not forget the proper saying that cutting necks
is better than cutting (our) means of living. Oh God
Almighty, be witness that we have warned them."
   Although these threats are stronger than some he made in
the past, this isn't the first time Mr. Hussein has indicated
he has his eye on the leadership of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. In a long-running effort to
dominate the Middle East, the Iraqi president was moving in
that direction a decade ago -- until sidetracked in late 1980
by the war with Iran. Since the cease-fire in that war, his
aggressiveness within OPEC has resurfaced.
   On the basis of its oil reserves, second only to Saudi
Arabia's, Iraq already was a power in OPEC. But its oil
installations were badly damaged and its production capacity
curtailed by the eight-year war with Iran.
   For more than two years now, Iraqi oil officials have been
taking increasingly bigger roles in OPEC affairs. More
recently, President Hussein's strategy has been to force up
oil prices. In that regard, he blames Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates for "economic warfare" against Iraq and others
because of the world oil glut brought on by their chronic
cheating on OPEC quotas. Since February, the Iraqi president
has been threatening retaliation against such overproducers.
A few weeks ago, he wrote harsh letters to the rulers of
Kuwait and the UAE, demanding they reduce output.
   Now, Mr. Hussein's belligerence may be a product of Iraq's
postwar economic squeeze. With its war debt estimated at as
much as $80 billion, Iraq is the most dependent on oil
revenues of all the major OPEC members. A reconstruction
program, which has seen the rebuilding of the former
frontline cities of Basra and Faw, as well as a vast military
buildup, has been hampered by this year's decline in oil
revenues.
   Revenues have fallen some 20% from last year's estimated
$15.5 billion level. Oil provides around 95% of Iraq's
foreign exchange earnings, and over a year every $1 drop in
the price of oil costs Iraq an estimated $1 billion.
   Moves against overproduction by the United Arab Emirates
and Kuwait started at the Baghdad Arab summit last May. The
United Arab Emirates has been overproducing its OPEC-set
production quota by about one million barrels a day and
Kuwait by some 200,000 barrels a day. Partially as a result,
oil prices have fallen from OPEC's benchmark target of $18 a
barrel to as low as $14 a barrel. Prices have recently come
back to $15 a barrel following pledges by Kuwait and the UAE
to adhere to OPEC quotas.
   In his television speech, Mr. Hussein said that since the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the U.S. is seeking
to become the only world superpower and aims to control Gulf
oil.
   "Saddam Hussein has been speaking as though he's the head
of the Arab world," said Don Kerr, a Middle East expert at
the Institute for Strategic Studies in London. In April, Mr.
Hussein threatened to "burn half of Israel" with chemical
weapons if it attacked Iraq. "He has been the voice of the
Arabs standing against Israel, against Western economic
imperialism, and here again he is the voice of the Arabs
against the venal agents of the Western powers," said Mr.
Kerr.
   But Mr. Kerr doesn't expect the gulf states to be much
intimidated by Mr. Hussein's threats. "Arabic rhetoric always
is colorful, so it's natural in the region for people to
discount what they are hearing," he said.
