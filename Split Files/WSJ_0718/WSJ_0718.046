   A BLOW FOR SABENA

   The Brussels Commercial Court found Sabena World Airlines
guilty of violating a European Community competition law that
prohibits concerted practices that prevent, restrict or
distort competition.
   SWA, the new Brussels-based joint venture between Sabena,
British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, has a virtual
monopoly on traffic rights out of Belgium. In its decision,
the court prohibited SWA from winning new takeoff and landing
slots at Brussels airport for an indefinite period,
regardless of appeals.
   This interdiction could seriously undermine SWA's
expansion plans and cause its two airline partners to lose
interest. British Airways and KLM each paid $50 million last
year for 20% stakes in the venture, leaving the rest to
Sabena, now a holding company. Their idea is to transform
Brussels airport into a major European hub by increasing
flight frequencies and adding new routes that link secondary
cities via Brussels.
   Sabena said it would appeal the court's decision to limit
slots. KLM and British Airways declined to comment.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN TAX CHANGE
                                                                                                       

   South Korea plans to curtail tax favors granted to foreign
businesses starting next year, the Finance Ministry said.
Officials said the ministry has drafted a plan calling for
granting tax favors only to foreign businesses investing in
high technology; even for those companies, the tax-exemption
rate would be cut to 50% from the present 100%. Finance
Ministry officials said the proposed changes are intended to
ensure fairer competition between Korean and foreign
companies.
                                                                                                       

   OVERCROWDED FEZ
                                                                                                       

   Morocco said that the ancient city of Fez was falling into
decay through overcrowding and that 100,000 residents would
have to leave. The population has swollen from 120,000 to
over 300,000 without any new houses being built, said Moulay
Ahmed Alaoui, minister of state without portfolio. Local
authorities have set up a private company to build 25,000
apartments in satellite towns over the next five years to
house 100,000 people now living within the city walls. "Some
houses formerly occupied by one family are now occupied by 30
families, with as many as three families living in one room,"
he said.
                                                                                                       

   RICE PRICE INVESTIGATION
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Fair Trade Commission has started an investigation
into alleged price-fixing collusion among 12 rice wholesalers
in Hokkaido, a Japanese news agency said, quoting commission
sources. The wholesalers handle rice marketed outside control
of the government; more than 50% of Japanese rice is priced
by such wholesalers. The sources said the case may affect the
government's plan to further deregulate rice distribution,
including the planned formation of rice exchanges in Tokyo
and Osaka.
                                                                                                       

   SPANISH BANK MERGER
                                                                                                       

   Two of Spain's largest savings banks, Caixa de Pensions
and Caixa de Barcelona took a major step toward merging into
the nation's biggest financial institution. The two
Barcelona-based banks successfully passed the first obstacle
in their path by winning approval from the Catalonian
regional government. The merger, which must be authorized by
Spain's Finance Ministry, would create one of Europe's
biggest banks. Combined deposits of both banks are estimated
at more than four trillion pesetas ($39.48 billion), said a
Caixa de Pensions spokesman.
                                                                                                       

   OPENING UP VIETNAM
                                                                                                       

   Vietnam has amended its foreign-investment law to let
private groups cooperate with foreign organizations, the
official Vietnam News Agency said. Only state entities were
allowed such contacts under the original law issued in 1987.
The report said the amendment opened the field to private
groups "except in some areas reserved for the state sector
such as {the} defense industry and economic or technological
branches of strategic significance for the economy."
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN TO BAN DRIFT NETS
                                                                                                       

   Japan will stop drift-net fishing in the South Pacific
this season, said the Japanese Embassy in Canberra,
Australia.
   The statement, drafted by Tokyo's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, said Japan would suspend drift-net fishing in the
coming 1990-91 season, a year before the date set by a United
Nations resolution.
   Drift nets have been criticized by conservationists for
indiscriminately killing marine life. Australia has joined
many other Pacific nations in calling for their use to be
banned.
   Hailing Japan's decision, New Zealand Prime Minister
Geoffrey Palmer said: "This announcement removes a very
significant irritant from discussions with Japan about the
scope for environmental and other cooperation in the region."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Australian teen-agers are risking their lives by taking to
sewers on bicycles and skateboards in imitation of the stars
of the U.S. TV series "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," police
in Melbourne said. In one recent incident, 18 officials spent
four hours chasing a group of children through sewers; the
children escaped. . . . The Sherpas, a tribe of mountaineers
and high-altitude guides in Nepal, want Mount Everest to be
renamed for a Nepalese climbing hero, said a Japanese news
agency. The mountain was named after Sir George Everest, a
British surveyor general of India.
