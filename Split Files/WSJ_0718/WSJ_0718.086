   Polaroid's net income dropped to $32.9 million, or 45
cents a share, from $42.7 million, or 62 cents a share, in
the year-ago period, as sales declined to $475.6 million,
from $486.6 million. Earnings dropped even though the
company's effective tax rate dclined to 31%, from 41% in the
1989 second quarter.
   Shipments of instant film dropped, as retailers lowered
inventory, the company said. Camera sales were flat. "Higher
levels of investment in marketing and in new product
development" also cut into profit, the company said.
   For the first six months, Polaroid's net income fell 5.7%,
to $64.7 million, or 89 cents a share, from $68.6 million, or
87 cents a share, on a lower number of shares outstanding.
Sales dropped 1.8%, to $911.8 million, from $928.9 million.
