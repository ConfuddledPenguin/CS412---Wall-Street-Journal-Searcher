   WASHINGTON -- The nation's industrial production rose
modestly last month, bolstered by a jump in utility output
during a torrid late-June heat wave, the Federal Reserve
reported.
   Industrial output grew 0.4% in June following a 0.6%
increase in May. With the rise in production, the country's
factories, utilities and mines used more of their capacity in
June: 83.5%, up from 83.3% in May.

   The modest growth in output was higher than many analysts
expected, but it still left economists disagreeing over the
state of U.S. industrial health.
   The 2.1% leap in utility output, largely due to a surge in
air conditioner use, was obviously temporary. And another big
factor, a substantial increase in automobile production,
probably won't continue either, several analysts predicted.
Car companies have been fattening inventories in anticipation
of contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, which
get under way today.
   "This is actually confirmation, if we needed any at this
juncture, that the economy is running low and slow and
probably will continue to do so because the increases in
industrial production and capacity utilization are related to
factors that are temporary, not fundamental," said David
Littmann, senior economist at Manufacturers National Bank of
Detroit.
   But while auto and utility production accounted for
three-fourths of the total increase in output, according to
the Fed, a number of other categories also posted small
gains. Production of paper, chemicals, appliances, television
sets, fuels, furniture and business equipment all rose.
   "I'm encouraged," said Stephen Roach, senior economist at
Morgan Stanley in New York. "I think these data do reflect a
gathering of momentum in the manufacturing sector. I think
that could be an important swing factor to an improved tone
in the U.S. economy."
   U.S. manufacturing, hurt by the Fed's efforts to fight
inflation by keeping interest rates high, has been ailing for
more than a year. Just a few weeks ago, the Labor Department
reported that factory employment continued to decline in
June, the 14th month of the past 15 in which it has dropped.
   But Mr. Roach said the decrease doesn't entirely reflect
weakness. "I think the job cuts are largely restructuring
driven by a manufacturing sector that wants to compete in the
global economy." He cited recent strong productivity gains in
manufacturing as one reason behind continued improvement in
output.
   "We're still looking at a manufacturing sector that
overall is in transition to leaner, meaner stuff," Mr.
Littmann said.
   Recent government reports have suggested to some analysts
that the worst may be past for many manufacturing industries.
Factory orders grew substantially in May. Exports continue to
improve, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
Moreover, the Fed last week eased its grip on credit for the
first time since December, allowing a pivotal interest rate
to fall slightly.
   Still, most analysts expect continued improvement in
manufacturing to be gradual.
