   PARIS -- Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine will pay about
three billion francs ($540 million) for its planned
acquisition of a 25% interest in Spain's Cia. Espanola de
Petroleos and slightly less than one billion francs for 3.2%
of Banco Central, according to a newspaper interview with a
senior official of the state-controlled French energy group.
   Alain Guillon, president of the group's Elf France unit,
said in an interview with the business daily La Tribune de
l'Expansion that both purchases are aimed at reinforcing the
group in southern Europe, in line with its drive to have
marketing and refining operations in areas where it is
present in exploration and development.
