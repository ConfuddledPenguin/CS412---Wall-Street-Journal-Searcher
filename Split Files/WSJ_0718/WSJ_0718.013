   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co., a chemical concern, said
it agreed to form a joint venture, effective Aug. 1, with
Kansai Paint Co. of Osaka, Japan, to supply coatings to
Japanese and South Korean auto makers with operations in
North America.
   Du Pont said that the venture, Du Pont-Kansai Automotive
Coatings Co., will include auto parts suppliers in its
market, and that it is the first in North America between
U.S. and Japanese suppliers of auto finishes. Du Pont will
own 60% of the venture, for which it projected first-year
sales of about $40 million.
