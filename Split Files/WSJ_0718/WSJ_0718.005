   There are eight kinds of eyes in nature -- ranging from
flies' multifaceted orbs to our own fast-focusing versions.
Now researchers are working on a ninth.
   A robot eye to emulate human vision remains a distant
dream -- scientists still don't know much about the higher
brain-processing involved in seeing. But an emerging
technology called binary optics promises to help replicate
some of the eye's basic, scene-interpreting functions,
revolutionizing machine vision.

   That's just one of dozens of applications for the
technology, say binary-optics researchers. Their to-do list
includes making advances in medical lasers, cameras,
high-definition television, surgically implanted eye lenses
and the creation of three-dimensional images. The advent of
binary optics "compares to the invention of the microchip in
importance," declares Jack Blais, president of Optical Filter
Corp., Natick, Mass., which makes parts for military
night-vision systems and other products based on the
technology.
   That remains to be seen. But the technology does represent
a leap in optics analogous to the leap in electronics when
researchers began etching tiny circuits on silicon chips.
During the past few years, companies such as Texas
Instruments Inc., American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., Honeywell Inc.,
Rockwell International Corp., Perkin-Elmer Corp., Polaroid
Corp. and General Electric Co. have placed research bets on
binary optics. Largely an offshoot of federally funded
defense research, the technology is rapidly becoming yet
another high-tech front on which U.S. companies will face
stiff competition from Japanese and European concerns.
   Sometimes called diffractive optics, it combines
refraction, the bending of light by lenses, with diffraction,
the breaking up of light waves by sharp edges or narrow
apertures; credit-card holograms are based on diffraction.
Among other things, the combination promises high-quality
optics made with cheap, plastic lenses fabricated by
computer-controlled machines.
   For instance, single refractive lenses typically cause
aberrations, such as bending blue light more than red.
Engineers traditionally solve the problem in cameras and
other devices by adding corrective lenses. With binary
optics, however, the corrections are made by carving
diffraction patterns -- many fine, staircase-like notches --
on the surfaces of conventional lenses. That enables a
single, cheap lens to do what once required multiple,
high-quality ones.
   At Polaroid and other companies, for example, "there's
been a big kick during the past two or three years" to
develop inexpensive, plastic camera lenses based on binary
optics, says Peter Clark, a Polaroid researcher. Similarly,
various companies are working on cheaper lens systems for
laser printers, compact disk players and other devices in
which light beams must be channeled and focused. Researchers
caution, however, that problems remain to be worked out
before the new technology can be used commercially.
   Another variation on binary optics involves placing arrays
of microscopic, optical components on computer chip-like
devices to meld, redirect or otherwise manipulate light rays.
This form of the technology is being explored by Rockwell,
AT&amp;T and other companies for optical computing, in which
light beams would be used to carry massive flows of
information without cumbersome wires.
   The idea of combining refraction and diffraction isn't
new, but the computer-design and fabrication technology to
make it practical "really came together" only recently, says
Michael Morris, a researcher at the University of Rochester's
Institute of Optics. One of the enabling technologies is a
computer-driven, lathe-like machine that rotates lenses on
cushions of air and notches them with diamond-tipped cutting
tools. Binary optics researchers also have borrowed
techniques from integrated-circuit-making to plant rows of
tiny lenses and other optical parts on silicon chips.
   One of first major consumer products based on the new
technology is expected to be implantable replacements for eye
lenses. Cataract and other patients whose damaged natural
lenses are replaced by plastic ones can see distant objects
but can't focus on nearby things without glasses. Using
binary optics, Minnesota Mining's 3M Vision Care unit has
developed "dual-focus" lenses enabling patients to clearly
see both near and far objects. The company says it plans to
begin marketing the lenses in the U.S. next year.
   At the other end of the binary-optics spectrum, Chromatek
Inc., based in New York, plans to use the technology to
distort vision. With the help of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Lincoln Laboratory, a leader in binary-optics
research, it is developing eyeglasses that would give a
three-dimensional look to specially colored television or
movie images. Chromatek, contends a spokesman, soon "will be
able to make glasses for pennies that are far better" than
the red-and-green spectacles previously used for 3-D effects.
   Perhaps the technology's most intriguing prospect,
however, is its potential for shedding light on problems that
have stymied progress in robot-vision research. For years,
scientists have tried to simulate the eye's ability to pick
out important things in images, such as edges and moving
objects, by translating thousands of dotlike picture
elements, or pixels, into numerical data and analyzing them
with sophisticated computer programs. But in the real world,
scenes change much faster than computers can analyze them. To
replicate only our edge-perceiving abilities with this
approach, according to one estimate, would require millions
of personal computers working in parallel. And that's just
for one eye.
   Binary optics promises seeing devices that work more like
our eyes, says Wilfrid Veldkamp, a researcher at MIT's
Lincoln Lab who is spearheading work in the area. He
envisions chip-like devices with thousands of tiny optical
and electronic components that would simulate certain of the
eye's nerve cells, called the amacrine layer. The cells help
pre-process and simplify images before they are sent to the
brain. The approach, which he has dubbed amacronics, would
drastically cut the amount of data to be analyzed for motion
and edge detection. "We probably won't solve the mystery of
the eye in my lifetime," he says. "But we're building a
technology that will get us to the type of things the eye
does."
