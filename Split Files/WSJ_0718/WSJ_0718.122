   NEW YORK -- Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. named a new head of its
junk-bond research group a day after announcing that it will
advise regulators on the sale of a sick thrift's $3 billion
junk portfolio.
   The General Electric Co. unit named Joseph V. Amato to
succeed Stephen J. Albert as head of junk, or high-yield,
research. Mr. Albert will be director of corporate credit at
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., another GE subsidiary.

   In an interview, Mr. Amato, a senior analyst in Kidder's
junk group for five years, says his biggest challenge is
"stepping through the mine fields" of the battered junk
market and avoiding "other deals that are going to fail."
   Although the junk market has rebounded recently, triggered
by gains in some RJR Nabisco Inc. issues, Mr. Amato says he
isn't "convinced the market is all back to normal."
   Monday, Kidder announced that it will advise savings and
loan regulators on the sale of the huge $3 billion junk-bond
portfolio of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, Beverly
Hills, Calif.
   Kidder, for its part, isn't any stranger to regulatory
pressure. In April, the firm sold its junk bonds, bridge
loans and other merchant bank holdings to GE Capital Corp.,
GE's big corporate finance unit, for $750 million, under
pressure from credit rating companies and the New York Stock
Exchange to shed some of its risky investments.
   Just weeks before the sale, Kidder hired two junk-bond
traders from Salomon Inc., including Thomas Bernard. Mr.
Amato will report to Mr. Bernard, a managing director and
Kidder's head of high-yield sales.
