   Major U.S. drug makers reported higher earnings for the
second quarter as a result of increased sales, cost-cutting
measures and new products.
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. led the field, posting a 26% increase in
earnings, followed by Upjohn Co. with a 21% upturn, and
Pfizer Co., whose earnings rose 11% from the year-earlier
quarter.

   Higher earnings had been expected from the pharmaceuticals
concerns, and analysts were pleased with results at Lilly,
which exceeded most analysts' estimates. Because one-time
items boosted Upjohn's earnings, however, that company's
results generated some investor disappointment.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Upjohn
shares fell 50 cents each, to $41.50. Pfizer closed up $1.125
at $69.25. Despite its strong earnings, Lilly closed down
87.5 cents at $88.875.
                                                                                                       

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Record-high world-wide sales contributed to the surge in
second-quarter earnings for Lilly. The Indianapolis
pharmaceuticals giant said the rapid growth of its
anti-depressant Prozac paced sales, which grew 24% to $1.225
billion from $986.6 million a year ago.
   Lilly said that among other contributors to its growth
were the anti-ulcer drug Axid, the antibiotic Ceclor, and
Humatrope, the growth hormone that earlier this month was
reported to decrease the debilitating effects of aging.
   The company's medical-instrument systems segment had
another strong quarter, led by the Cardiovascular Systems
unit, which is benefiting from regulatory difficulties
encountered by a competitor.
   The company said cancer diagnostics led to increased sales
in its Hybritech unit for the quarter. Lilly's acquisition of
Pacific Biotech Inc., a developer of immunodiagnostic-testing
products, also was completed during the second quarter.
   "This is a very high quality {earnings} quarter," said
Jerome Brimeyer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. He
attributed the drop in Lilly's stock yesterday to either
large profit-taking or reaction to rumors of a suit involving
the drug Prozac.
                                                                                                       

   Upjohn Co.
                                                                                                       

   Upjohn, helped by one-time items, reported a jump in
earnings from the previous year. The Kalamazoo, Mich.,
company posted revenue of $805 million, up 11% from $728
million a year ago.
   Strong sales in the U.S. and Europe, and cost-cutting
measures implemented in 1989 helped boost quarterly earnings,
the company said. U.S. sales rose 9% to $487 million from the
previous year; foreign sales climbed 13% to $318 million.
   In addition, a $43 million pension credit and other
nonrecurring charges raised pretax earnings by $28 million,
or 10 cents a share, the company said. The pension credit
involved lump-sum payments to employees who took advantage of
an early-retirement program announced last year.
                                                                                                       

   Pfizer Inc.
                                                                                                       

   Pfizer said second-quarter sales rose 15% to $1.5 billion
from $1.3 billion in the period a year ago.
   In the quarter, Pfizer said health-care product sales
surged 26% on the strength of some new products. The company
said it received more than $165 million from sales of its new
cardiovascular drugs, Procardia XL, Cardura, Minipress XL and
Norvasc; the anti-fungal drug Diflucan; and the Monorail
Piccolino coronary angioplasty catheter, which is used to
clear arteries.
   Pfizer said it expects the benefits from new products to
continue, saying it anticipates having six new drugs approved
by the Food and Drug Administration during the next two
years.
   The company said its specialty-chemicals sales grew 4% in
the quarter, but animal-health sales were flat and
consumer-product sales dropped 2%. Specialty minerals sales
fell 20% but would have increased 13% if not for the sale of
a pigments business.
