   WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is being asked to learn a lesson from its
snafus with the Hubble Space Telescope: When it comes to
space, follow the military.
   Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), who heads the Senate science
and space subcommittee, chewed out NASA for failing to
conduct tests the military routinely conducts on spy
satellites. At a hearing today, a Senate appropriations panel
plans to probe NASA's test procedures.

   But telescope scientists and former NASA officials say the
Pentagon is at the root of some of Hubble's problems. The Air
Force limited the number of NASA managers who could oversee
Hubble early in the program, the scientists and officials
say. They add that the space agency, facing cost overruns and
schedule delays, counted too heavily on Pentagon inspectors
and Hubble contractors to catch problems with the telescope.
   "There was a problem of constraining costs from day one"
with Hubble, says Rep. George Brown, (D., Calif.), a senior
member of the House Science and Space Committee and a former
member of the Intelligence Committee. "NASA kept trying to
squeeze an extra buck, {while} cost is no consideration to
the military."
   Moreover, say optical scientists appointed by NASA to look
at the Hubble flaw, NASA made a fundamental error in its
testing program. Once the agency rejected the military tests
as too expensive and unlikely to yield the precision data it
wanted, it didn't substitute simple tests that could have
caught Hubble's defect.
   "Replacing common sense with sophistication was part of
the problem," says John Mangus, a NASA optics expert who is a
member of the Hubble review board. "There are sanity checks
you {can} use."
   Bill Colvin, NASA's inspector general, says he fears that
the lack of controls that let Hubble's problems go undetected
for 10 years, still dogs the space agency. "I have concerns
about the space station -- that we will repeat the same
mistakes," he says.
   NASA's problems with the $2.5 billion Hubble surfaced late
last month when the agency found a defect in one of the
orbiting telescope's mirrors. That problem leaves Hubble
myopic and puts off for at least three years half the
experiments astronomers had planned. But the problems began
in 1977 when Perkin-Elmer Corp.'s optics division, purchased
last year by the Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors
Corp., won a $63.4 million contract to build the mirror and
pointing system.
   According to an investigation by the House Appropriations
Committee in 1983, the Air Force insisted that NASA restrict
to 90 people -- half its usual staffing -- the number of
people who could oversee the project. The Pentagon "wished to
limit the number of NASA personnel `penetrating' contractors
who were also working on classified Department of Defense
projects," the report said. At the time, Perkin-Elmer was
believed to be making the optical system for the KH-9 spy
satellites.
   The restrictions ended in 1979, the report said, but NASA
was slow to increase its Hubble oversight staff. From 1979
through 1981, when Hubble's mirrors were being polished and
tested, only three NASA personnel oversaw work at
Perkin-Elmer's Danbury, Conn., optics facility, says John
Rich, who heads the Hughes subsidiary.
   "NASA couldn't put the numbers of technical people in the
plant to monitor {the project} as they usually do," says
James Beggs, who headed the space agency in the early 1980s.
   Instead, he says, NASA depended on Air Force inspectors
who were at Perkin-Elmer to look after Hubble. Rep. Brown,
who has reviewed both military and civilian space programs,
says the longstanding rivalry between the Air Force and NASA
may have gotten in the way. (The Air Force declined to
comment.)
   Neither Perkin-Elmer nor NASA discovered that one of the
Hubble mirrors was seriously flawed. To guard against such a
mishap, Sen. Gore and Rep. Brown say the Pentagon insists on
an elaborate test for military satellites in which mirrors
are aligned as they would be in space to ensure the mirrors
are accurately formed.
   NASA rejected that test because it was costly and because
the agency didn't feel the test would yield accurate enough
information on the quality of the Hubble mirrors. Optics
experts say the military test isn't crucial -- if substitute
tests are used. But NASA and Perkin-Elmer rejected the
substitutes, too.
   The defect in Hubble was so coarse -- as much as 25 times
worse than the prescribed accuracy -- that a number of simple
tests could have caught the flaw, including one holding a
knife's edge to the mirror and measuring the shadows it
casts.
   Richard Harms, a scientist at Applied Research Corp.,
Landover, Md., who oversaw a second of Hubble's five
instruments, says he had to fight for months in the mid-1980s
just to get NASA to do a so-called lens-cap test. That test
involves shining a light in the front of the telescope to
make sure it comes out the back -- the equivalent of making
sure you remove a lens cap on a camera before snapping a
picture.
   "The reasoning was if you can't do a test that meets
specifications, why do the test at all," he says. "The reason
is you test to the best capability to guarantee you don't
have a horrible error."
