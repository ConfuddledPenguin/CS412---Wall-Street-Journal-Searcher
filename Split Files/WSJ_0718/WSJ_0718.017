   OSAKA, Japan -- A top Kubota Corp. executive, responding
to allegations that the Japanese company fraudulently
obtained U.S. computer technology, said two Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs brought the charges only after their private
demand for a $7 million payment was refused.
   Last Thursday, the founders of a supercomputer graphics
company filed a lawsuit in Superior Court in Santa Clara,
Calif., alleging that Kubota forced the merger of their
company with another -- a combination that became Stardent
Computer Inc. They alleged that Kubota then began to transfer
the technology to one of its subsidiaries.

   But Masahiro Yoshida, a Kubota managing director, cast
events in a different light in an interview at the company's
headquarters here.
   He characterized the allegations as "bold-faced lies" and
portrayed Kubota as the savior of a struggling U.S.
technology company that couldn't find U.S. capital. Kubota's
only mistake, Mr. Yoshida indicated, was perhaps naively
stepping into a high-technology market characterized by rapid
ups and downs and heated personality clashes -- much
different than the staid Japanese market.
   Mr. Yoshida displayed a copy of a letter dated June 1,
1990, and signed by Joseph Alioto, attorney for Allen Michels
and Matthew Sanders, the co-chairmen of Stardent who filed
the suit. In the letter, various grievances the pair had
against Kubota were outlined, and a request was made for a
payment of $3.5 million apiece, to be paid in the form of a
five-year consulting fee. The letter indicated the two men
would quietly leave the company without bringing charges if
they received the money.
   "If we had paid the money they had demanded at the
beginning, does that mean we can pay money to steal American
technology?" Mr. Yoshida asked.
   Mr. Michels acknowledged that Mr. Alioto sent a letter to
Kubota proposing a $7 million settlement, which the two
considered "reasonable." But other evidence of Kubota's
alleged wrongdoing emerged after the letter was sent, he
said.
   As to accusations that the pair is presenting "bold-faced
lies," Mr. Michels said, "That's why we have courts. We have
a significant amount of evidence that we feel will back up
our complaints."
   Mr. Alioto said the pre-suit request for a settlement that
Mr. Yoshida referred to was disclosed in the suit and didn't
constitute a big disclosure.
   Mr. Yoshida's remarks were the company's first detailed
response to the allegations, although Kubota apparently plans
a strong counteroffensive. The company has scheduled a news
conference in Tokyo Friday to discuss the matter. Mr. Yoshida
said Kubota hadn't yet formulated a legal strategy because
the company hasn't yet seen the lawsuit.
