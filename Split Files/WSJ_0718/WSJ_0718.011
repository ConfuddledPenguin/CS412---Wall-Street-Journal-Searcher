   OTTAWA -- Canada's merchandise trade surplus widened to
958 million Canadian dollars (US$826.9 million) in May,
partly because of an increase in motor-vehicle exports to the
U.S., Statistics Canada, a government agency, said.
   In April, the surplus totaled C$371 million.

May exports and supplied 70.5% of Canada's imports.
