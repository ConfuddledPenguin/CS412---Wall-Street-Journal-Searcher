   AKITA, Japan -- Seiichi Suda's business is booming. The
electronics factories the entrepreneur owns are operating
flat out, and Mr. Suda is feeling prosperous enough that he
just bought a slick new $60,000 Nissan Infiniti, with
ash-gray leather seats and a telephone.
   Guzzling an iced coffee to fight off the summer heat in
this coastal city 400 miles north of Tokyo, the voluble
49-year-old laughs when he remembers how uneasy he felt last
winter. Tokyo's stock market was plunging relentlessly. More
than $1 trillion in capital, the equivalent of one-third of
Japan's annual output, was wiped out. The world's second
largest economy seemed at risk.

   "I was so fearful then," Mr. Suda recalls. "I worried for
the economy and my business. But now it seems like a bad
dream. It means nothing."
   As Mr. Suda's personal experience shows, the market
battering that traumatized big investors in the first three
months of this year has proven surprisingly painless to
Japan's, and the world's, economy. The effect of the plunge,
declares Yasuyuki Yoshida, a senior analyst at Mitsubishi
Research Institute, was "just psychological."
   In fact, the Japanese economy continues to grow, having
roared ahead at an annualized rate of 10.4% in the first
quarter. The 44-month expansion, powered by buoyant corporate
and consumer spending, is Japan's second longest in modern
times. Analysts generally expect the Japanese economy to grow
at least 4.5% to 5% for 1990, not as fast as in the first
quarter but a very healthy clip. Next year, Japan seems all
but certain to extend its streak beyond the record 57-month
Izanagi Boom of the 1960s.
   The strength of Japan's economy is also reaching abroad:
Imports are surging, and exports from Japan, aided by a weak
yen, are on the rise again. Bolstered by such fundamental
strengths, the Japanese stock market has recovered more than
half of its first-quarter losses, closing yesterday at
33172.28, up 150.55.
   In fact, some economists now say the stock plunge may have
been just the tonic Japan's economy needed to ward off a bout
of inflation that could have brought growth to an abrupt
halt. "There was a dual economy in Japan: the financial
economy of the stock market and the real economy," says Kengo
Inoue, manager of the Akita branch of the Bank of Japan and
the central bank's former head of domestic economic research.
"The financial economy was inflated before the crash. Some
people may have thought that it was sustainable. We never
did."
   It was the Bank of Japan's decision to impose the higher
interest rates that triggered the stock-market dive. The aim
of raising rates was to curb asset inflation -- inflation
that critics say the Bank itself had fed by wrongly trimming
interest rates to all-time lows in early 1987. When last year
ended, share prices were towering at nearly quadruple their
levels of five years earlier. Japanese land prices had also
surged, doubling in five years.
   Fearful this asset inflation would trigger price inflation
and choke economic growth, the Bank of Japan last year began
constraining credit by raising interest rates. The financial
markets at first ignored the rate increases, but in early
January began unraveling. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks
didn't bottom out until it reached 28002.07 April 2, some 28%
below its record close of 38915.87 at the end of 1989.
   Nonetheless, the bank's strategy now appears to have
worked, almost beyond anyone's expectations. Prices lately
have stabilized. The latest wholesale price statistics show a
meager 0.9% year-to-year increase for June; in January, by
contrast, producer prices were up 2.6% from a year earlier.
   To be sure, there are weak spots in Japan's economy that,
along with higher interest rates, could work to slow Japan's
economy later this year. The tight labor market is a prime
example. There are currently 141 jobs for every 100
applicants in Japan (the highest ratio in 16 years), which is
forcing many manufacturers to spend more than planned on
automating their factories. Still, national wage negotiations
earlier this year locked in moderate wage increases for many
workers at least through next April, reducing the risk of
wage-fed inflation.
   Most important, consumer and corporate confidence has
withstood the shocks of both the stock-market crash and
higher consumer interest rates, which are now double levels
of a year ago. (Mortgage rates, for example, are now as high
as 10%.) Few people have curtailed spending in light of lower
stock prices. One reason is that individuals aren't
especially big stock owners in Japan -- they own one share in
five, whereas adults in the U.S. own one in four -- and thus
weren't big losers in the market plunge. The Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. estimates in one scenario that the
negative effect of this year's market decline on personal
consumption will be only 0.2% -- hardly enough to dent
Japan's economic progress.
   Itoko Akiyama's experience illustrates the resilience of
the Japanese consumer. With the money she made investing in
stocks over five years, the Japanese housewife bought a new
red Mercedes-Benz, remodeled her suburban Tokyo apartment and
dressed her three teen-agers in the latest fashions. After
the market soured, Mrs. Akiyama's stockholdings were worth
25% less, but will she stop spending? "No," she says, after
finishing a lunch with a friend at an elegant downtown Tokyo
restaurant. "I still have plenty of profits. And the market
will recover."
   Such confidence is just what government planners here want
to hear. Small investors like Mrs. Akiyama are taking profits
and continuing the consumer-spending spree driving the
economy. Non-investors are spending more of their rising
wages.
   In May, after the stock market had about gotten through
its bad patch, consumers put on a show of strength: retail
sales jumped 12.5% from a year earlier. Luxury cars are in
such demand that for some of them, buyers must wait as much
as a year for delivery. Even housing starts have shrugged off
the interest-rate increase; they were up 31% in April from a
year earlier after climbing 60% in March.
   Corporations have remained just as free-spending, as a
tour around Akita, a port town on the Sea of Japan, makes
clear. Akita Electric Co., a Hitachi Corp.
semiconductor-making subsidiary, initially planned to spend
$200 million on new machinery this year. But, driven by
strong sales, a need to keep pace with new technologies and
hopes of offsetting its labor supply problem with more
automation, the company has decided to raise that spending to
$400 million.
   "This is a competitive industry," says 66-year-old Kogo
Sato, who set up Akita Electric 20 years ago. "To compete, we
have to spend." Like many big Japanese companies, Hitachi can
afford to. The five-year boom on Tokyo's stock market made it
easy for big companies to raise fresh funds, and many big
concerns, including Hitachi, Toyota Motor Corp. and
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., are sitting on billions
of dollars in cash. More than 32 Japanese companies earned
profit of more than $70 million each last year simply on the
income from their cash hoards.
   Seiichi Suda, the electronics business owner, demonstrates
how most businessmen barely broke stride during Japan's
recent rise in interest rates and stock market turmoil.
Energetic and sporting a crew cut, Mr. Suda subcontracts
assembly work from Japan's giant electronics makers. His
small empire includes six separate electronics companies and
a pair of insurance concerns employing a total of 1,800
people and generating sales of $150 million a year, quadruple
sales of five years ago. Mr. Suda estimates that, in another
five years, sales could top $330 million.
   Even though he borrows two-thirds of the money he uses for
new investments, he says higher interest rates haven't
deterred him. "I'm trying to improve efficiency so I can
compete with bigger companies," he says. "Business is great,"
he adds. "You can't stop just because interest rates go up."
In a May survey, the Bank of Japan found that Japanese
manufacturers invested 16.5% more than they did the year
before.
   That willingness to spend could be a long-term boon for
Japanese companies, economists say. Rivals in the U.S. are
facing a possible crunch because of lenders' caution, while
competitors in Europe will be focusing much of their
investment on the East bloc. Heavy corporate investment now
in research and new equipment could help Japanese companies
gain an important lead over international rivals.
   For the moment, though, Japan's spending is generally good
news for its trading partners, since the country's domestic
demand -- the combined spending of consumers and corporations
-- has been strong enough to pull along some other economies,
too. Japan's imports in 1989 grew to $210.8 billion, up 12.5%
from the previous year. Its exports were up 3.9% to $275.2
billion.
   Exports have lately shown signs of faster growth. Despite
the Bank of Japan's higher interest rates, investors haven't
been induced to put more money in yen. The currency has
remained relatively weak, dipping at one point as low as 160
yen to the dollar, about 12% below its average level in 1989.
   The weak yen means Japanese products are cheaper for
buyers overseas, and that has been spurring exports,
economists say. In the first quarter, exports surged at an
annual rate of 38.7%. The weak yen also means that Japanese
companies' earnings from foreign operations will jump this
year in yen terms. Nikko Securities Co. recently estimated
that total corporate profits for Japanese companies in the
year ending March 1991 will climb 4.1%, after rising 8% in
the year ended March 31.
   "Corporate earnings should set a record for consecutive
years of growth," concurs Nomura Securities Co.'s research
unit. The record now is five years, from 1965 to 1970.
   All of which has helped the stock market recover a good
deal. In a reversal of gloomy forecasts in April, many
analysts now expect the economy to remain on track and the
Nikkei index to end 1990 even higher than where it closed at
the end of 1989.
   "There are many happy people," says Harumi Ichiki, a
director of Sumitomo Life Research Institute Inc., a think
tank. "This year's pay rises are higher than last year's,
there is almost full employment, people can enjoy overseas
travel, and the country is the world's biggest creditor
nation. It's hard to say we aren't happy."
