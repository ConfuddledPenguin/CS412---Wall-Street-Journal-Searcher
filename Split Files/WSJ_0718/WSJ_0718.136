   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is once again
rolling out its 0% financing gambit in an effort to spur
sales of certain 1989 and 1990 model cars and trucks.
   Chrysler began offering the 0% rate on 24-month loans
yesterday, replacing a 2.9% rate for two-year contracts it
had offered since June 1. Chrysler first offered 0% financing
on short term contracts in April 1989.

   But the offer, which runs indefinitely, probably won't
help most shoppers. Even without finance charges, many
consumers can't afford to pay off a car within 24 months, and
Chrysler isn't offering similar discounts on longer-term
loans. Finance charges stay at 7.9% for 25-month to 48-month
loans and 10.9% for 49-month to 60-month loans.
   Among the vehicles covered by the 0% financing offer are
1989 and 1990 Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport-utility
vehicles and Comanche pickup trucks. Also affected are the
1989 and 1990 Plymouth Sundance, Dodge Shadow, Plymouth
Acclaim and Dodge Spirit compact cars.
   Meanwhile, Chrysler said that beginning Monday it will
increase daily production by 17% at its Sterling Heights,
Mich., plant that builds the Shadow and Sundance.
   So far this year, Shadow sales have dropped 13% and
Sundance 25%. Inventory levels are relatively high for both
cars.
   But Chrysler said it has received an increase of dealer
orders for the 1991 models due out this fall because the cars
are gradually replacing the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon
models -- which were discontinued in February -- as
Chrysler's low-priced, entry-level compact vehicles. Dealers
are anticipating higher sales of Shadow and Sundance models
once they get rid of the leftover Omnis and Horizons.
