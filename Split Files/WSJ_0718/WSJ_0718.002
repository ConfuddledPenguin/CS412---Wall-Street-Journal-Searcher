   Lewes, England -- Los Angeles is hardly an unfamiliar
landscape to most of the world. It is seen too often on
television and in movies to be that. So Peter Sellar's notion
of using the city as the setting for a production of "The
Magic Flute" might have seemed almost banal had it originated
anywhere but here. But at the Glyndebourne Festival, bastion
of upper-crust British opera-going, Los Angeles might as well
be Pluto.
   Glyndebourne luxuriates verdantly in East Sussex, an
80-minute train ride south of London, where an atmosphere of
stuffy upper-class insularity has pervaded the festival for
more than 50 years. Audiences don evening dress and devour
lavish picnics on the lawn during the long intermission. And
Mozart opera is revered.

   Into this rarefied preserve, Mr. Sellars, the young
American director who thrives on shaking things up, has,
depending upon your point of view, either trespassed on a
pure and noble tradition or breathed some much needed new
life into it. Most British critics have rallied behind the
Spirit of Glyndebourne Past. Max Loppert of the Financial
Times called the production "the flattest, laziest, emptiest
piece of work in festival history."
   Mr. Sellars obviously has succeeded in disturbing the
serenity of Glyndebourne, but he has more in mind than that.
In a welcoming note to the audience he announced his goal of
staging "the struggle within each character between the flesh
and the spirit." Coming from the man who already had achieved
something similar at his much-discussed stagings of Mozart's
three Da Ponte operas for the PepsiCo Summerfare festival in
New York, this was not just program chatter.
   At PepsiCo, Mr. Sellars also used modern settings. But the
dramatic power of those productions sprang from deeper causes
than the transformation of Don Giovanni into a Harlem drug
dealer, the transplantation of Figaro's marriage from an
18th-century villa outside Seville to modern Manhattan's
opulent Trump Tower, or the devolution of "Cosi fan Tutte"
from 18th-century Naples to an American seaside diner of
today.
   Vivid and provocative as these changes of scene may have
been, Mr. Sellars's greatest directorial stroke was to infuse
his mundane modern characters with nobility of spirit and to
make their crises as moving as those of periwigged creatures
of the aristocratic past. Mr. Sellars did that not through
visual effects and shocking dislocations of time, but by
relying on the music to show character and emotion.
   People who don't like Mr. Sellars's work -- and the opera
world seems pretty evenly divided between those who do and
those who don't -- often object to the way he underscores
nearly every musical phrase in an aria with some sort of
exaggerated expressive gesture. But that also is the source
of the dramatic vitality of his work. And since music is a
more universal language than words for conveying feelings,
Mr. Sellars's outlandish updatings generally work well, even
when they contradict the letter of the libretto.
   At Glyndebourne, Mr. Sellars never expected his modern-day
scenic trappings to fit perfectly with the opera's fairy-tale
surface or its many layers of symbolism underneath. Instead,
what he came up with was a group of not-so-strange characters
in a strange land.
   Tamino is a kid in blue jeans lost at the Los Angeles
airport. The Queen of the Night is any mother fighting to
hang on to her rebellious daughter. Papageno, though
anachronistically retaining his traditional bird-catcher
garb, suffers like everyone else, his suicide attempt no
longer farcical but truly disturbing.
   Sarastro's temple looked like an underground garage.
(Adrianne Lobel's ingenious set was divided horizontally. The
top half featured pastel postcard projections of Los Angeles,
as if the scenes were played out on a billboard on Sunset
Blvd.) But here Mr. Sellars became a bit fuzzyheaded about
just who the priests were, leaving the impression of a
Synanon group or a spiritual cult. Tamino is led underground
by three boys on skateboards.
   Without exactly spelling it out, Mr. Sellars seemed to be
presenting Tamino and Pamina as drug addicts undergoing
rehabilitation. And Monostatos pursued them in a three-piece
suit, like a narc.
   But what separates this "Flute" from Mr. Sellars's other
Mozart productions is that he was not in the mood to explain
himself, as he usually does. "The Magic Flute" is a mystic
and mysterious opera, and in an effort to keep it so, Mr.
Sellars discarded all the spoken dialogue from the libretto.
This left behind a series of purely musical scenes, some of
them brilliant.
   Tamino and Pamina's trial by fire and water is perfectly
and lucidly set in front of a raging fire in the Malibu hills
overlooking the Pacific. Papagena's transformation from a
dying old woman in a wheelchair to a young woman is a
heart-rending, easily comprehensible image of renewal.
   But Mr. Sellars also can be too mysterious, keeping the
audience guessing where the lines are drawn between fantasy
and reality. And sometimes he appears to do things simply
because they look good, as with the obscure hand gestures
(based on the signing of the deaf) that his characters
perform in sync with the music.
   Still, Mr. Sellars seems on his way toward creating a
rarity in the opera world, a really satisfying "Flute." And
it is to Glyndebourne's credit that it supported him in the
effort with a young and convincing cast headed by Kurt
Streit, an eloquent Tamino, and James Maddalena, an intense
Papageno. Lothar Zagrosek conducted with the urgency this
show requires.
   Following its final sold-out performances this month, the
production will tour Britain in the fall, be videotaped for
the BBC and the home market, and return as part of next
summer's all-Mozart festival here. Glyndebourne's official
appetite for Mr. Sellars and California apparently has not
been appeased even by the prospect of a repeat of this year's
turbulence. Festival planners are hoping to get Mr. Sellars
to create a new opera with the U.S. composer Tod Machover
based upon Thomas Pynchon's recent novel of post-hip life,
"Vineland." But the notoriously farouche Mr. Pynchon so far
has shown not the slightest inclination to give Glyndebourne
the rights to his book.
