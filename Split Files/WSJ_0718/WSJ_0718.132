   LONDON -- Wait till next year] That's the rallying cry in
the British stock market, where many investors are talking of
a Utopia they hope will follow a sluggish next few months.
   The question for investors now is how fast the government
of Margaret Thatcher can reverse the British inflationary
spiral. The first sign of progress -- an interest rate cut --
is expected sometime between autumn and early 1991.

   In the intervening months, some think stocks could fall
about 5%, as the strong pound undermines export earnings and
high interest rates keep squeezing profits in construction,
real estate and retailing. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100 Index, at 2415 yesterday, is expected to drift down
toward the mid-2200s in coming weeks.
   Nevertheless, "the market will hit 2700 before it hits
2200," predicts James C. Fisher, a fund manager with Scottish
Amicable Investment Managers Ltd. of Glasgow, which now has
about half its #9 billion ($16.22 billion) of managed assets
in U.K. stocks. The index could hit 2700 "on the first move
downward in interest rates" around year end, he says.
Currently, Britain's base rate is 15%.
   Britain's stock market has long tracked America's,
shuddering in October 1987 and 1989 and rallying this year in
January and late spring. Restraining the market now are
Britain's slow economy (1% growth is forecast for this year)
and inflation (currently 9.8%).
   The tough times mark the first real setback in a decade
for Mrs. Thatcher's free-market economics. In response, the
Tory government, facing a general election by mid-1992, has
scripted a plan to restore the economy by first restoring
confidence. "It's election economics," says Alexander
Hammond-Chambers, vice chairman of Ivory &amp; Sime PLC, an
Edinburgh fund manager.
   Britain is expected soon to join the European Monetary
System's exchange-rate mechanism, or ERM, where the pound
would be aligned in a narrow band of assigned values with
West European currencies. Although the move would stabilize
sterling, talk of Britain's joining has sent the pound up
sharply, giving the government a politically safe
anti-inflation tool. (A strong pound lowers the cost of
British imports and boosts export prices. Higher prices cut
sales, crimp profit and make it easier for British companies
to resist high wage demands.) Once the high pound cools
inflation, money managers believe Britain will join the ERM
and couple entry with a rate cut.
   "Inflation should peak in August, be down to 8.5% by the
end of the year and to 6% by mid-'91," predicts John K.
Thomson, senior investment manager of Edinburgh-based
Standard Life Assurance Co. Britain's largest mutual insurer
with #21 billion under management, Standard Life is pumping
an average #14 million of new money into the U.K. stock
market weekly. "Once we go into the ERM, I see the market
moving ahead," he says, adding: "We're favorably disposed
toward equity investments."
   Mr. Thomson thinks takeovers of British companies will
increase once Britain enters the ERM. Leading candidates will
be companies with good distribution in the U.K. and on the
Continent, such as financial services and food-manufacturing
concerns. Transport companies such as British Airways,
Tiphook and Peninsular &amp; Oriental also should benefit from
Europe's economic integration, he says. But the strong pound
makes him "quite cautious" about textile companies with heavy
overseas sales such as Courtaulds, Coats Viyella and Dawson
International.
   Reduced international tension has cast a pall over
defense-oriented stocks such as British Aerospace and
Britain's General Electric, which isn't related to General
Electric of the U.S.
   Richard Kersley, equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Securities, says that with rates likely to fall to 11%
in a year's time, he's "more positive {on} interest-rate
sensitive companies" such as retailers Marks &amp; Spencer,
Kingfisher and W.H. Smith Group; building-materials supplier
Redland; and Taylor Woodrow, a major builder. The strong
pound has made "a short-term sell" of drug maker Glaxo, with
47% of its sales in the U.S., he says. Barclays has switched
RTZ from "buy to hold." He thinks other internationally
oriented British companies such as SmithKline Beecham,
Reuters, Burmah, Cable &amp; Wireless and Rothmans International
will be hard-pressed to sustain recent strength.
   Mick Brewis, an investment manager at Edinburgh-based
Baillie Gifford, bought Grand Metropolitan shares recently.
"It's in a stable area -- food, and I think they'll get
benefits out of the Pillsbury acquisition," he says. He's
cool toward small companies, saying it pays to be "cautious
in a recession environment. We've reduced our exposure to
small building companies and retailers."
   But Scottish Amicable's Mr. Fisher reckons that lower
interest rates should revive the British building and
real-estate industries. About #1 billion of the firm's #4.5
billion in the U.K. stock market is in companies with market
values below #150 million. "The ones that will survive are
the guys who've been in the business for years," he says.
Such companies include Polypipe and Heywood Williams Group
(building materials); Vibroplant, a construction-equipment
leaser; Johnston Group, an engineering concern, and home
builders Persimmon and Bellway.
