   Saudi Arabia's oil company made another discovery of light
crude oil south of the kingdom's capital city of Riyadh.
   On tests, the discovery well, the Al-Hazmiah No. 1, flowed
at a rate of 4,300 barrels a day, according to Hisham Nazer,
Saudi oil minister and chairman of Saudi Aramco, the oil
company.

   This is the sixth oil find by Saudi Aramco -- most of it a
high-quality type that is much in demand world-wide -- in the
kingdom's central province in the past 13 months.
   But earlier hopes of high government officials that these
finds would prove to be linked into one vast giant field --
bigger even than the kingdom's Ghawar, the world's largest --
are fading.
   Recent interviews with geologists and other oil
exploration experts familiar with the drilling effort in
Saudi Arabia's central province confirm that the finds appear
to be separate fields. Also, they are relatively small by
Saudi standards. They are expected to hold reserves of around
500 million barrels each, minor additions to Saudi Arabia's
proven oil reserves of more than 250 billion barrels, or
one-fourth the world's total.
   Still, the finds are significant. They are turning up new
oil reserves well away from the original concessions held by
the old Saudi-American consortium of Aramco in the main oil
province of eastern Saudi Arabia. Exploration experts noted
that the source rock of this new oil is a Silurian shale
believed to be 300 million to 350 million years old, compared
with some 250 million years for the source rock in the
original producing area to the east.
   More important, much of the oil in the vicinity of the
discoveries isn't only light in density but also low in
sulfur content. That makes it a "sweet" crude, a high-quality
grade that is similar to Louisiana's sweet crude. Several
attractions permit these crudes to draw premium prices. They
pollute less than the heavier high-sulfur grades that are
generally produced in the Middle East. They also yield more
preferred fuels such as gasoline.
   Mr. Nazer confirmed that the Al-Hazmiah well's oil tested
free from sulfur and that its gravity measured 48 degrees API
(American Petroleum Institute). The higher the gravity, the
lighter the oil. The lightest crude Saudi Arabia currently
produces in commercial quantities is Berri, which is 39
degrees API. But the chief Saudi crude, Arabian Light,
measures only 34 degrees. The kingdom's other crudes are even
more dense.
   A mix of sweet crudes would improve the kingdom's revenue
base. Although it is the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi
Arabia restricts its output to 5.4 million barrels a day
under the quota system of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. The drop of some $4 a barrel in OPEC's
oil prices in recent months has reduced Saudi Arabia's
revenue by more than $20 million a day.
   Individuals close to developments said Saudi Aramco has
two drilling rigs operating in the area south of Riyadh. The
kingdom is understood to have plans to spend at least $500
million over the next five years in developing fields there.
   Mr. Nazer said the Al-Hazmiah well is about 130 miles
south of Riyadh. It is only about six miles south of the
Al-Howtah field, the first discovery in the central province.
Depths of the discoveries range between 6,000 and 9,000 feet,
Mr. Nazer said.
