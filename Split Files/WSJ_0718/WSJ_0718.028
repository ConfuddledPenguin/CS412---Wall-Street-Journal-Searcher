   NEW YORK -- A group of asbestos victims in Virginia asked
a federal appeals court to halt efforts by a U.S. judge in
Brooklyn, N.Y., to overhaul the Manville personal-injury
trust.
   The asbestos victims, who recently won court judgments
totaling $60 million against the trust, asked the court to
lift a stay ordered last week barring the trust from making
any payments. The stay was issued by federal Judge Jack B.
Weinstein in Brooklyn, who is pressuring the trust to
restructure its financing to make up for its huge shortfall
in cash.

   In their appeals-court filing, the Virginia plaintiffs
said that Judge Weinstein overstepped his jurisdiction and
that changes in the structure of the trust are prohibited
under bankruptcy law. The trust was set up in 1986 to enable
Manville Corp. to emerge from bankruptcy-law proceedings; the
trust, which generates funds largely through its ownership of
Manville stock, is independent of the Denver-based company.
   Robert R. Hatten, an attorney for the Virginia plaintiffs,
said his clients are being unfairly penalized by Judge
Weinstein's efforts to change the trust.
   "These people all proceeded through every step set forth
in the Manville reorganization plan. They followed everything
they were told to do" in making claims against the trust, Mr.
Hatten said. Now that a federal court in Virginia has entered
judgments in the cases, however, "we've had the rug yanked
out from under us," he said.
   In ordering the stay on payments by the trust, Judge
Weinstein said the stay could be lifted Aug. 6 if the trust
comes up with a way to restructure its financing and change
the way it pays claimants. But Mr. Hatten said that the stay
was likely to be renewed and that changes in the trust's
financing could hurt the Virginia plaintiffs' efforts to
collect their money.
   "The district court {in Brooklyn} acted in unprecedented
fashion by undertaking, without a motion by any party and
without a fair opportunity for affected claimants to protect
their rights, to stay payments and executions of judgments
that were about to go forward across the U.S. under the terms
of the confirmed Manville reorganization plan," the
plaintiffs said in their filing.
   The filing asked the appeals court to rule that Judge
Weinstein lacks authority to change the trust radically
because it was part of a bankruptcy-court reorganization.
   "Even if the trust does ultimately run short of current
funds . . . such a circumstance doesn't give a district court
the power to substitute another reorganization plan that it
favors," the plaintiffs said in their appeals-court request.
   Meanwhile, attorneys for plaintiffs and defendants in
other asbestos cases questioned the validity of a federal
judge's order in Cleveland Monday setting up a nationwide
asbestos class-action lawsuit.
   Lawyers on both sides said motions were likely to be made
to overturn the order by Judge Thomas D. Lambros. But they
also said that it is unclear what the immediate impact of his
order will be.
   "It's vague enough that no one knows exactly what he
means," said John Kazanjian, an attorney for the Center for
Claims Resolution, which represents several former asbestos
makers.
   In issuing the order, Judge Lambros said a national class
action is necessary because the defendants don't have enough
money to pay all the claims.
   Several attorneys, however, dispute Judge Lambros's
assertion, and they say the judge failed to take necessary
steps to determine whether enough money or insurance coverage
is available among all the defendants. "Many of the
defendants would violently disagree," said Gita Rothschild,
an attorney for Owens-Illinois Inc., Toledo, Ohio, a former
asbestos maker. "A handful of defendants have said they lack
the money or insurance coverage."
   Another issue is whether a judge can simply order a class
action without a hearing on who will make up the class. Judge
Lambros was unavailable for comment.
