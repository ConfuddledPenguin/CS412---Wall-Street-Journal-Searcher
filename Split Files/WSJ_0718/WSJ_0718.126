   WASHINGTON -- President Bush would veto civil rights
legislation pending in the Senate, Chief of Staff John Sununu
said soon after senators voted to limit debate on the
measure.
   The 62-38 vote, which sets up a vote on the bill as early
as tonight, was followed by accusations by Republican
senators that the Democratic majority used a strong-arm
procedural move when the White House and GOP senators were
negotiating in good faith.

   Mr. Sununu accused Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), a
leader of the proponents of the bill, of reneging on an
agreement to use substitute language that would have made it
clear that the measure wasn't intended to result in hiring
quotas. The issue of quotas has been the main problem
Republicans have had with the legislation.
   "The bill as crafted right now is a quota bill, and the
president has said he will veto that quota bill," Mr. Sununu
told reporters.
   But Mr. Sununu, mindful of the political damage the
president would suffer if he is perceived as a foe of civil
rights protections, emphasized the White House's willingness
to accept a bill if the Senate returns to the compromise
language. "The president is eager to sign" an acceptable
bill, Mr. Sununu said.
   At about 9:00 EDT last night, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell (D., Maine) said negotiations on the bill
would continue and that both parties agreed to 12 hours of
debate beginning at 10:15 this morning.
   Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.), who earlier suggested with
some sarcasm that perhaps he should be replaced as the Senate
GOP leader because of the eight Republicans who voted with
the Democrats in cutting off debate, said last night: "It's
worth one last shot, one last effort."
   The cloture vote, in which the eight Republicans and one
Democrat strayed from party lines, indicated that the civil
rights bill would pass easily. But the vote also fell five
short of the two-thirds vote needed to override a
presidential veto.
   Mr. Kennedy denied that he reneged on an agreement with
the administration, saying neither he nor the president had
ever said a deal had been "locked up." Paul Donovan, the
senator's press secretary, said, "There was never a meeting
of the minds on this, and there was never a final agreement."
   The Civil Rights Act of 1990 is designed to nullify five
Supreme Court decisions last year that the bill's advocates
say severely hurt efforts to achieve equality in the
workplace. It is the top agenda item for the civil rights
community and the target of strong opposition by business
groups.
   Immediately after the cloture vote, Mr. Dole said that the
Democrats' decision to "shove it down {GOP} throats"
threatened bipartisan cooperation. He warned that there
wouldn't be any action in the Senate "until we have some
agreement," adding, "we're going to run this place in a civil
manner."
   Mr. Mitchell, trying to show that the bill wasn't being
railroaded, outlined efforts by Democrats to work with
Republicans on the measure.
