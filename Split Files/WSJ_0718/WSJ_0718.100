   NEW YORK -- In a wild final hour of trading, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average surged from a 21-point loss to close
unchanged at 2999.75 -- a fraction shy of the 3000 mark.
   It was the second consecutive day the industrial average
failed to cross 3000.

   At around 3 p.m. EST profit-taking in several leading
growth stocks combined with futures-related selling to drive
the industrial average lower, and what seemed decisively away
from the 3000 mark for the day. By 3:30 p.m., the average was
off about 20 points. Then one of the most powerful influences
on the average -- the Chicago Board of Trade's Major Market
stock-index futures -- came into play.
   Donald Selkin, futures analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, said stock-index arbitrage programs in the MMI
shot the Dow industrials back up to the 3000 level in the
final half-hour of trading. That view was confirmed by
traders in Chicago who make markets in MMI futures.
   Said one: "There was a lot of activity out here, and a lot
of liquidity." The MMI, when active, has a powerful impact
over the Dow industrial average because it contains 17 of the
30 Dow industrial stocks.
   Mr. Selkin said MMI buy programs were set off by a number
of large futures traders who are trying to buy back contracts
they had sold "short" earlier. This buying pushed the futures
to a large premium over the underlying stocks. Arbitrage
traders, then, started selling the more expensive futures and
buying the stocks underlying the MMI, vaulting the Dow
average 20 points higher in minutes.
   Mr. Selkin also noted that the number of outstanding
futures positions in the July contract, which expires this
Friday, has steadily increased over the past few weeks, to
9,544 after Monday's close. Normally, the number of
outstanding positions decreases before expiration. The rise
in open MMI positions shows that investors are starting to
use the futures as a hedging vehicle again. That's not
surprising because many money managers are holding a small
group of growth stocks, some of which are components of the
MMI, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble and Merck.
   Mr. Selkin also noted that the large amount of open
positions points to the possibility of a volatile expiration
in the July futures this Friday.
   Before the final-hour fireworks, investors focused on
earnings. There was good news for some stocks in the Dow
industrial average. Coca-Cola Co. reported that
second-quarter profit was up 19% from a year earlier; the
stock jumped 1 7/8 to 47 1/4.
   Among other Dow industrial issues, Chevron advanced 1 to
75 7/8 in response to Pennzoil's disclosure that it will
purchase 3.9 million additional common shares, boosting its
8.8% stake in the company to just below 10%. United
Technologies continued to attract buyers, rising 1 5/8 to 62;
American Express gained 1/2 to 31 3/8; Sears Roebuck added
3/4 to 34 1/2 and Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber rose 1/2 to 30 1/8.
   But outside of the Dow industrials, the scene was grim.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered
advancers, 877 to 643. Broader market indexes spent most of
the day lower, and closed that way: Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index fell 1.43 to 367.52 and the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index dropped 0.64 to 200.49.
   Sellers pounced on United Telecommunications after it
disappointed investors with second-quarter earnings. The
stock fell 8 3/4 to 29 1/2 on nearly 12 million shares,
making it the most active Big Board issue.
   GTE, whose second-quarter earnings were a milder
disappointment, dropped 3/4 to 28 1/4 on 3.6 million shares.
While the company reported an 11% increase in net income, its
earnings of 54 cents a share were slightly below the range of
analysts' estimates.
   Another issue hit with forceful selling was Lowe's, which
retreated 6 to 41 3/8 on 1.9 million shares. Oppenheimer &amp;
Co. removed the stock from its list of recommended issues;
also, Dean Witter Reynolds lowered its earnings estimate for
the fiscal second quarter, citing pressure on the company's
gross margins.
   The plunge in Lowe's -- a home improvement retailer --
broke investors' confidence in several key retail-related
growth stocks.
   Home Depot tumbled 1 3/8 to 41 5/8; Wal-Mart Stores eased
3/4 to 35 1/2, and Woolworth slipped 3/8 to 35 3/4.
   International Business Machines fell back 1 5/8 to 120 3/4
as 1.7 million shares changed hands. It had risen 1 3/8
Monday following a well-received earnings report for the
second quarter.
   Other technology issues also lost ground, including
Unisys, which dropped 3/4 to 12 1/4 on 1.5 million shares.
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Rick J. Martin attributed
the sell-off to "false rumors" that Unisys was having trouble
placing a debt offering and that an analyst was predicting
the company might cut its dividend. Company officials
couldn't be reached for comment on the speculation.
   But Honeywell, whose second-quarter earnings from
continuing operations climbed 54% from a year ago and were
better than expected, rallied 3 5/8 to 110 3/4.
   Manufacturers Hanover gained 3/4 to 31 5/8 despite
reporting that second-quarter operating earnings dropped 12%.
Separately, the Federal Reserve Board permitted the bank
holding company to handle futures and options brokerage.
   Other bank stocks to move higher in the wake of quarterly
reports included NCNB, which gained 1 3/8 to 37 7/8; Wells
Fargo, which went up 1 1/2 to 80 1/8, and Dime Savings Bank
of New York, which added 3/8 to 6 3/8. Bank of New York,
whose second-quarter earnings were off 39% from a year ago,
fell 1 1/8 to 27 1/2.
   Chase Manhattan rose 3/8 to 21 1/8 on 5.4 million shares,
with dividend-related trades by institutions apparently
responsible for the bulk of the activity. While the stock now
carries a dividend yield of 11.6%, the company hasn't yet
declared its next quarterly dividend, and there is
speculation that Chase may reduce the payout because its
operating earnings for the first and second quarters have
fallen short of its dividend expense.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.19
to 364.39. Volume totaled 13,339,000 shares.
   Divi Hotels advanced 5/8 to 2 3/4. The company is in
discussions for the possible sale of its Caribbean
resort-hotel business to Accor of France.
