   French state-owned steel group Usinor Sacilor S.A. said it
provisionally agreed to buy one of the largest U.S.
steel-trading companies, extending its recent aggressive U.S.
acquisition drive.
   A Usinor-Sacilor offical said the Paris-based company had
signed an agreement with U.S. investment group Blackstone
Group to buy Edgcomb Corp., provided Edgcomb cleaned up its
balance sheet by buying back about $150 million in debt
outstanding before Aug. 10. The purchase price wasn't
disclosed.

   If the sale goes ahead, it will be the French group's
fourth move in the U.S. this year and follows a wave of
takeovers by Usinor-Sacilor in Europe and the U.S. last year.
   The official said that Usinor-Sacilor has now developed a
strong position in the U.S. stainless steel market and that
Edgcomb, which as a trading house has strong links with major
U.S. steel clients, would give the French group a vantage
point from which to study the flat steel market.
   Edgcomb had 1989 sales of about $600 million and and a
work force of about 1,600, he added. Blackstone acquired
Edgcomb last year in a leveraged buy-out.
