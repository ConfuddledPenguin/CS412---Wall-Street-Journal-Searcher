   SEVEN NATIONS REACHED an accord paving the way for German
unification.
   Resolution of the Polish border issue almost ensures that
a single new German state will be formed by year's end. The
accord -- which came during a meeting in Paris of the four
World War II allies, the two Germanys and Poland -- came one
day after the Kremlin withdrew objections to a united
Germany's membership in NATO. The border deadlock was broken
when the two German states pledged to sign a treaty
recognizing the current Polish border quickly after
unification. They also vowed to conclude a second treaty
later that would cover other aspects of relations with
Poland, including economic guarantees.
