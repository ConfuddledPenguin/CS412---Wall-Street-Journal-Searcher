   MILAN -- Enimont S.p.A. said it sold its pharmaceutical
unit Sclavo S.p.A. for 100 billion lire ($82.5 million) to
Marcucci Group, an Italian maker of blood derivative products
and vaccines.
   The sale was expected after Enimont re-acquired complete
control of Sclavo in May from former partner U.S. firm Du
Pont Co. At the time, Enimont rejected Du Pont's offer to
take control of Sclavo, saying the company played a strategic
role in Italy's national health network and therefore should
remain in Italian hands.

   With the acquisition, the Marcucci group will enlarge its
Italian market share to 50% from 33% and become one of
Europe's leading producers of pharmaceutical products derived
from blood, an Enimont spokeswoman said.
