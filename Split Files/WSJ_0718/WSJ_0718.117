   Perkins Foods PLC, London, said it has agreed to buy two
Dutch food manufacturers, Bakker Lekkerkerk Holland B.V. and
K.B. de Souffle Specialist B.V., for an initial 71.6 million
guilders ($38.4 million).
   Perkins, which is attempting to build an integrated food
manufacturing and supply network across northern Europe, said
it will pay for the purchases through the issue of 30 million
convertible preference shares, expected to raise #28.9
million ($52.1 million).

   The company said Bakker will allow it to move into the
Dutch market for daily delivery of chilled, fresh food
products to supermarkets. De Souffle is a maker of frozen
filled pancakes with distribution in the Netherlands and West
Germany.
   A further 3.9 million guilders may be paid to the Dutch
companies depending on future profitability, Perkins said.
   Perkins added that it intends to seek a listing on the
Amsterdam stock market.
