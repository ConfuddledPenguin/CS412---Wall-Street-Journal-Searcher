   DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Premark International Inc. said it will
take an after-tax charge of $15.9 million, or 50 cents a
share, in the second quarter for certain restructuring
actions at its Tupperware unit.
   Premark said that while its earnings for the quarter will
"decline substantially" compared to the year-earlier as a
result of the charge, the company doesn't expect to report a
loss for the quarter.

   In the second quarter of 1989, Premark, a consumer and
restaurant concern, earned $23.7 million, or 68 cents a
share, on sales of $657.9 million.
   Earlier, Premark said it expected lower earnings for the
quarter, as "declining dealer activity remains a challenge
for Tupperware's U.S. business, and difficult industry
conditions hamper its food equipment group's domestic
operations" as well as certain other businesses.
   The company said on a pretax basis, it expects to save
about $25.8 million through 1992, and $12.5 million annually
after that, as a result of actions associated with the
charge.
   These actions include the elimination of more than 300
jobs at Tupperware's U.S. manufacturing plants and the
closing of a plant in Rhode Island, the company said. In
addition, it said Tupperware's Orlando, Fla., headquarters
will trim its staff by about 15%, or 100 workers.
   Premark said the moves will help improve results in the
near term, as well as "position the company to generate
increased growth and broaden its customer base over the long
term."
