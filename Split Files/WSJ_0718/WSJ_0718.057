   HALLE, East Germany -- The world's longest-serving foreign
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, grins as his small air
force jet sets down at the airfield nearest the East German
farm village of Reideburg, where he was born.
   He recalls his family's Sunday outings to the same
airfield in 1936, for joy rides in a single-engine Junker 43.
"It cost just five reichsmarks to circle the airfield and
return," he says.

   By age 15, he was a member of the Hitler youth, like most
Germans his age, and he manned anti-aircraft guns. By 18, he
had entered the army, the Nazis had been defeated and he was
an American prisoner of war. Then he was bedridden for two
years with tuberculosis. His family moved west in 1952 to
escape communism.
   Now 63 years old, Mr. Genscher has been instrumental in
forging an historic opening to the Soviet Union that has
removed the last barriers to German reunification. It took
more than 50 hours of meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in 10 cities around the world this year
to lay the groundwork, but the result will transform the two
nations' relations.
   Germany will be whole and remain a member of a
less-military Western alliance, and the Soviets have won a
commitment for an unprecedented level of German economic,
political, scientific and technological cooperation.
   Mr. Genscher's foreign ministry officials complain that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is getting too much of the credit for
merely harvesting the crops planted by Mr. Genscher. In weeks
to come, they plan to highlight the foreign minister's role
in advance of the all-German elections where his Free
Democratic Party, the junior coalition partner in Bonn, will
have to fight to maintain its government position.
   For most of the Reagan administration, "Genscherism" was
considered by many in Washington to be a dangerous, naive
capitulation to the Soviet Union -- a route to West German
neutralism.
   "Now Genscherism has become a broad, mass movement," the
foreign minister says as he drives through the East German
countryside in his armored gray Mercedes 420. He defines the
term as his "successful" effort to change the East by working
more closely with it.
   So why were so many so suspicious of Mr. Genscher?
   "Perhaps it was because no one could imagine it would turn
out this way," he said. "Many thought it would first lead to
a drifting away of the Germans (from the West). I've always
thought there is too little faith in the West in the power of
freedom. Also, I am from this area, and I understood better
what was going on." Even before barriers started falling, Mr.
Genscher would come to Halle each year for a secret
pre-Christmas visit to friends and relatives.
   He points out the window to the village of Reideburg,
toward the farmhouse where he, his mother and his grandfather
were born, and drives by the flat-roofed stone church where
he was baptized.
   In 1943, the 15-year-old Genscher was sent with the rest
of his class to man the anti-aircraft guns near town. "I was
on the radar equipment," he said. "It was fascinating
technically. None of us ever knew such things existed until
we were sent into the field." But he backpedals
diplomatically when asked how many British and U.S. planes he
brought down. "The planes flew higher than we could shoot and
our radar failed when they dropped (aluminum) strips," he
said.
   Mr. Genscher's tour is informal. The planning was
uncharacteristically ad hoc -- the expected escort of East
German police didn't show, and Mr. Genscher's driver
improvised from a stack of maps.
   Mr. Genscher has slowed little since a heart attack a year
ago and several bouts with exhaustion since then. Now, he is
buoyant. Mr. Genscher has come to his home region to help his
Free Democratic party, also known here as the Liberals,
inaugurate a new local affiliate. He has been West Germany's
foreign minister for 16 years, but his party often has
struggled to gain enough votes to join coalitions, first with
Social Democratic Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and now with the
Christian Democrats' Helmut Kohl.
   The party meeting is an hour from his birthplace in
Zerbst, a town of 40,000 which was the birthplace of Russia's
Czarina Catherine the Great. Mr. Genscher recalls mentioning
her to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as one of Germany's
contributions to Russian history. Mr. Gorbachev replied that
she, after Peter the Great, had been the most important of
the pre-revolutionary leaders.
   "The people of the Soviet Union should know, that a
unified Germany isn't only an opportunity for the Germans,
but it is also a chance for German-Soviet relations, with
prospects for the next century," he tells them. He shouts
encouragement to "liberals," telling them that just because
socialism failed doesn't mean that Germany should throw in
its lot with conservatives. In East Germany, he must take
votes from Mr. Kohl. If the Christian Democrats score too
well, Mr. Kohl might cast aside his troublesome coalition
partner.
   Mr. Kohl and Mr. Genscher have crossed swords often in
past weeks, and one individual in the chancellery complains
that the foreign minister doesn't always fully brief them on
his meetings with the Soviets. "We have almost totally
stopped exchanging papers on Genscher's meetings, and now
virtually the only reports Kohl gets are given to him in
person," says an individual in the foreign ministry.
   Mr. Genscher leaves the party meeting to a standing
ovation. But his driver gets lost again, this time in front
of a rickety wooden ferry that crosses the Elbe.
   The ferry is slow. The foreign minister signs autographs.
He balks at detailing his own role in recent history, but his
aides say that he several times prevented new Cold War
icicles from forming.
   When the Soviets shot down Korean Air Lines flight 007 on
Sept. 1, 1983, the incident threatened to end the 35-nation
Confererence on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which Mr.
Genscher regards as one of the most important contributors to
change in the Soviet bloc. He made dozens of phone calls
around the world to prevent the U.S. from pulling out of a
CSCE meeting in Madrid to protest the Soviet action. One
senior U.S. official credits Mr. Genscher for keeping the
conference on track.
   Even more importantly, Mr. Genscher challenged Mr. Kohl to
stop the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan to agree
to the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons at its
summit in Brussels last year. Mr. Genscher was convinced that
such a move would allow the Soviet military to block Mr.
Gorbachev's intentions to make peace.
   He won U.S. backing to scrap the modernization.
   It was at that meeting that Mr. Genscher formed a close
relationship with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. Mr.
Baker "is a man who talks plainly, without detours," says Mr.
Genscher. "I can accomplish more in one hour with Baker than
I can in three hours with anyone else."
   Mr. Genscher simultaneously enjoys a close relationship
with Mr. Shevardnadze, which often has enabled him to act as
unofficial liaison between the Soviet and the American.
   The time for reflection passes. His driver is facing
another decision at the fork of another unfamiliar road.
Before Mr. Genscher can press on with reunification of
Germany or revival of his birthplace, he has to find his way
back to the airport. The foreign minister takes control of
the map and issues directions.
