   When Russian troops liberated his native Hungary toward
the end of World War II, the first thing John Lukacs noted
was their sense of inferiority. Soviet officials were stiff
and uncomfortable at receptions, and overreacted to
criticism. This was a case in which the conquered
condescended toward the conquerers.
   Russian soldiers, Mr. Lukacs says, mistook toilets for
wash basins and eau de cologne for scented vodka. "During the
eighteen months that I spent under Russian occupation I did
not meet a single Russian with whom I could talk more or less
intelligently, and not one who spoke an intelligible French
or English or even German," he writes in his autobiography,
"Confessions of an Original Sinner" (Ticknor &amp; Fields, 328
pages, $19.95).

   Hungary would have been transformed by a long-term German
occupation because German culture would have bled into
Hungarian life, he says. "As matters turned out, after more
than forty years of Russian occupation, the Russian influence
on the culture and civilization of my native country has been
zero."
   Mr. Lukacs managed to emigrate to the U.S. just after the
war. Settling outside of Philadelphia, he has spent a
productive life as a historian, writing among other things,
"Budapest 1900: A Historical Portrait of a City and Its
Culture" and "Philadelphia: Patricians and Philistines,
1900-1950." Being a historian has many advantages, but it
makes for boring memoirs. So Mr. Lukacs has instead written
an intellectual history about himself, rereading his own
diaries with evident pleasure in order to show how he became
a self-confessed reactionary.
   When Mr. Lukacs describes himself with that unpleasant
word, he means that he sees things he loves conquered by
their cultural inferiors. At one point he lists some of the
"inanities" he reacts against: sex education, Star Wars,
opinion research, quantification, abstract art and the GNP.
Elsewhere, he rails against shopping centers, political
movements and of course the media. Every day in every way,
the world is getting dumber and dumber.
   Mr. Lukacs frequently dances on the precipice of
crankiness, and sometimes goes over. He is asinine when he
goes out of his way to declare the movie "Casablanca"
imbecilic, or to announce that reading the New York Post
makes him feel like he is covered by grease.
   But he acknowledges that what a person's ideas are is less
important than how he entertains them. And on the whole, he
wears his reactionary identity skillfully. In the first
place, he displays a virtue of reactionaries -- fierce
independence of mind. Hell for Mr. Lukacs would be finding
himself intellectually fashionable, and then being feted for
it at Disney World.
   He also has the advantage of being learned and frightfully
intelligent. His book, elegant and high-minded, is studded
with pointed observations.
   Here is a lance that should deflate some intellectual
pride: "All my life I have been interested in how people
think. This kind of interest may not be reactionary, but it
is surely different from the psychoanalytic `why?' -- the
latter being but a premier version of the most pestilential
intellectual habit of the twentieth century, which is the
attribution of motives. I know something (not much) about my
motives; about the motives of others I know much less."
   "Henry Adams," he writes elsewhere, "who claimed to
represent the mindset of the eighteenth century, concluded
that history would now accelerate very fast. . . . He mistook
the speed of communications for the movement of ideas; the
first had become very fast, the second very slow."
   Pragmatists who seek a middle ground between extremes
might take note of this Lukacsian observation: "Just as two
wrongs do not make a right, the opposition of two stupidities
does not mean that the truth is somewhere in the middle: what
it means is that the atmosphere of discourse has been clouded
and corrupted beyond reason."
   The problem with Mr. Lukacs is not that he is too
intelligent; it is that he is intelligent about too many
things. It is one thing to be discriminating about Henry
Adams, but the same scrutiny ruins the fun of watching Johnny
Carson. A person who is unable to take a vacation from rigor
is a prisoner of self-consciousness. "Confessions of an
Original Sinner" is a superb guidebook to a rich intellect,
but Mr. Lukacs often misses the spirit of popular culture.
This book does not exactly glide along on a cloud of carefree
whimsy.
   Mr. Lukacs doesn't acknowledge that the things he disdains
make possible the things he savors. A society that does not
have efficient marketing mechanisms (shopping centers) is not
going to be able to afford university presses. A country
without mass culture is not going to have middle-class
colleges, such as Chestnut Hill College, where Mr. Lukacs
teaches.
   It's possible to watch MTV in the morning, build Star Wars
in the afternoon and still savor Lukacs in the evening. Maybe
Mr. Lukacs could set up a regimen for himself -- enforced
stupidity for an hour a day. A few rounds of mini-golf and
one gains a new perspective on things.
