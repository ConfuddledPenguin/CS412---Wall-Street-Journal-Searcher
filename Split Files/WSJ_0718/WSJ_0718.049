   GULF STATES UTILITIES CO. -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it raised the ratings on about $2.4 billion of
senior debt of this Beaumont, Texas-based utility. In making
the upgrade, the ratings concern cited the recent settlement
of a four year-old legal dispute related to power purchases
from Southern Co., Georgia. Moody's raised the ratings on
GSU's first-mortgage bonds and secured pollution control
revenue bonds to Ba-2 from Ba-3, and raised the unsecured
pollution control revenue bonds, Eurodebentures and
convertible debentures to Ba-3 from single-B-1. Ratings on
the utility's preferred and preference stock were confirmed
at Caa.
