   CLEVELAND -- TRW Inc. reported a 10% decline in
second-quarter profit because of increased interest costs and
a higher tax rate.
   The automotive-parts, aerospace and electronic-services
concern said that operating profit rose 4%, and that its
major businesses "continue to perform well in a persistently
difficult environment."

   Net income dropped to $63 million, or $1.01 a share fully
diluted, from $70 million, or $1.12 a share, in the 1989
second quarter. The company traditionally reports share
earnings on a fully diluted basis.
   Sales rose 14% to $2.1 billion from $1.84 billion.
   Interest costs rose to $46 million from $38 million in the
year-earlier quarter, reflecting higher borrowings, mainly to
finance acquisitions.
   Sales of auto and truck parts jumped 20% to $1.04 billion,
mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other
occupant-restraint systems. The group's operating profit rose
8% to $84 million. Higher engineering, product-development
and start-up expenses in the restraints business, weaker car
and truck sales in North America, and the unsettled Brazilian
economy limited the gain in operating profit, TRW said.
   TRW's space and defense segment reported a 9% rise in
sales to $862 million, and a "slight" increase in operating
profit to $61 million. Reduced government funding on certain
programs and a stretchout of others contributed to the
group's lower profit margins, as did higher investment to
develop future business, the company said.
   Sales of information systems and services rose 5% to $190
million, but operating profit declined about the same
percentage to $18 million. The company blamed a sales decline
at units performing maintenance service on electronic
equipment produced by other companies, and costs of
downsizing those businesses.
   For the first half, TRW reported net of $120 million, or
$1.93 a share, down 14% from $139 million, or $2.24 a share,
a year earlier. Operating profit rose 5%, TRW said. Sales
rose 13% to $4.09 billion from $3.63 billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
TRW fell 25 cents to close at $46.875.
