   DALLAS -- Southmark Corp said it ceded control of 33
limited partnerships to two former executives and
restructured mortgages that Southmark held on some assets
owned by those partnerships.
   Southmark also hired the former executives, John W.
Galston and Eugene H. Rosen, to provide investor-relations
services on 53 additional partnerships for which Southmark
remains general partner. The two had been engaged in proxy
fights to replace Southmark as general partner of its
privately held partnerships. Mssrs. Galston and Rosen
resigned two years ago as top managers at the company's
Southmark/Envicon syndication arm.

   The men, now principals of Limited Partner Investor
Monitoring Committee, Inc. (LPIMC), began their proxy
contests last year after Southmark filed for bankruptcy law
protection. The real-estate and financial services
conglomerate lost 33 of the contests.
   Under terms of the settlement, LPIMC will replace
Southmark as general partner of those partnerships. In
addition, Southmark will reduce interest rates and
subordinate principal on the partnership-related mortgages
the company holds so that the properties can handle their
debt service again. The parties agreed to drop their
lawsuits, and LPIMC agreed not to challenge Southmark's
control of the other 53 private partnerships.
   The restructured mortgages are held by Southmark's wholly
owned San Jacinto Savings Association, or are to be
contributed to the Houston thrift as part of the company's
plan of reorganization, confirmed by a bankruptcy court judge
Monday. A Southmark spokesperson said the settlement won't
have a material effect on the plan.
