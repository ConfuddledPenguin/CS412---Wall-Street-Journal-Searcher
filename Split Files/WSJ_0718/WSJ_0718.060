   It's company picnic season again. Time, too, to entertain
clients. Golf outings, Outward Bound expeditions, tennis
tournaments, that sort of thing.
   This year, though, a group of lawsuits may prompt some
companies to take a second look at the outings -- and
specifically at their liability if something should go
horribly wrong.

   Next month marks the two-year anniversary of one of the
worst tragedies the ad industry has seen. A white river
rafting trip on Canada's Chilko River, hosted by a DDB
Needham executive and attended by 10 other advertising
heavyweights, turned to disaster when the raft overturned,
killing five people.
   Now, three suits have been filed against DDB Needham and
others on behalf of victims' families. The first of the three
-- brought by the family of James Fasules, who was a retired
DDB Needham executive -- is scheduled to come to trial Nov. 5
in federal district court in Chicago.
   In light of the cases, companies "are looking at the work
and play aspect of their business a little closer in terms of
responsiblity," says John Kralovec, an attorney with the
Chicago law firm of William D. Maddux &amp; Associates, which
represents the widow of rafting victim Gene Yovetich, a DDB
Needham executive. "The first {Fasules} verdict will have a
real impact."
   The Chilko case brings up the tricky question of when a
business trip becomes a social outing, and vice versa -- a
distinction that will probably become an issue in the trials.
And the suits will almost certainly cause some chilling
effect on the most dangerous outings, such as rock climbing
and wilderness expeditions, that some companies sponsor for
clients.
   The pending cases already paint a grim picture for
companies sponsoring potentially dangerous outings.
Typically, firms hosting trips that could be risky ask
participants to sign a waiver -- but the Chilko cases suggest
that isn't always enough.
   Chilko participants did in fact sign waivers in a
Vancouver airport shortly before beginning their trip. But so
far, DDB Needham has been unsuccessful in trying to get the
suits dismissed based on the waivers. A federal judge in
Cincinnati -- where a suit on behalf of victim and former
Procter &amp; Gamble executive Robert Goldstein is pending --
said the waiver was too broad and ambiguous. A judge in the
Fasules case came to a similar conclusion.
   The lesson, says Stanley Chesley, the Cincinnati lawyer
representing Mr. Goldstein's family, is "if it's dangerous
enough to require a waiver, {companies} shouldn't be doing
it. They're going to be held accountable."
   Whether firms heed that advice remains to be seen. Bob
Wolf, chief executive officer of ad agency Chiat/Day/Mojo,
recalls a People magazine-sponsored trip he took a year and a
half ago to Yosemite. "It seemed like a tame exercise," he
says, "until we went rock-climbing. I would think all those
companies will take a hard look at all those boondoggles and
say, `What if somebody killed themselves?'" Yet, he adds, he
"probably would" do it again: "No one expects anything like
this to happen."
   At Time Warner, which publishes People, a spokesman says
the company still has outings, but "we have been looking into
the whole phenomenon of outings and coverage even prior to
the rafting incident." He says Time Warner's legal and
insurance departments review suggested outings before they
take place.
   The Chilko case also is prompting companies to think twice
about the most mild-mannered outings, such as company picnics
and softball games. Felix Kent, a New York attorney who
represents ad agencies, says that in light of the disaster,
"questions have come up about what happens on company
picnics, company outings, and to what extent does the company
have liability." While "I'm not sure any agency has changed
its practices, there certainly have been questions. Companies
have examined their insurance policies to see to what extent
they're covered."
   Several ad executives said they are indeed sponsoring
fewer outings. Yet the impetus isn't the sobering events at
Chilko, they said. Instead, it's plain economics.
   Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor, for one, stopped hosting
an annual golf tournament about three years ago, partly
because of its high cost and partly because "everybody's
working hard, and clients value their free time more than
they did 10 or 20 years ago when they had more of it," says
Jack Taylor, vice chairman.
   At D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, "the accident, tragic as
it was, hasn't influenced decision-making relative to client
entertainment," adds Roy Bostock, chairman and chief
executive. He, too, says that entertaining "just isn't a part
of the business anymore. People can't take five or six hours
during the day and play golf. There are just more important
things to do in helping clients."
   Mr. Bostock says that a couple of years ago, some DMB&amp;B
executives tried to organize a golf outing at Shinnecock, a
world-class golf course on Long Island. "It was canceled," he
says. "As much as people would have liked to have done it,
they couldn't find the time."

   Hidden Messages for Kids
                                                                                                       

   American kids receive a barrage of hidden advertising
messages from such powerful marketers as Coca-Cola, Disney
and Procter &amp; Gamble, according to a study released yesterday
by Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports.
   Topping the consumer group's list of gripes with corporate
marketers is the practice of distributing free teaching
materials, which are actually thinly disguised ads, according
to the report. The study also singles out licensing
agreements, celebrity product endorsements, commercially
sponsored kids clubs, "advertorials" and the placement of
such products as cigarettes and alcohol in movies.
   In the report, Grey Advertising Senior Vice President
Carol Herman is quoted as saying: "You've got to reach kids
throughout their day. . . . You've got to become part of the
fabric of their lives." A Grey spokeswoman says that the
agency wasn't asked to participate in the report, and that
Ms. Herman's comments were taken out of context.

   SNEAKER REP: Reebok's much-publicized contract
negotiations with pop singer Madonna, who was to star in a
new ad campaign for the sneaker company, have been called
off, Reebok said yesterday. In a brief statement, Reebok said
it couldn't come to an agreement with the singer on "timing
and schedules," in part because of her concert tour. Reebok
declined to elaborate or to say if other issues, including
financial terms, were part of the problem.
                                                                                                       

   CHIAT SELLS UNIT: Chiat/Day/Mojo agreed to sell its
Jessica Dee Communications public relations unit to a Jessica
Dee management group led by general manager and creative
director Patrice Tanaka. Jessica Dee left the company, which
she had sold to Chiat in 1987, last year. Terms weren't
disclosed.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: Twin Tire Systems Inc., Dallas, tapped Ayer's
Dallas office for its ad account. Billings weren't disclosed.
