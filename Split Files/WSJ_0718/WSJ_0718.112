   NEW YORK -- The first computerized auction of high-yield
junk bonds produced a trickle of trades yesterday, enough to
satisfy some of the giant institutions that participated in
the sale.
   The auction was organized by Joel Greenblatt, a
32-year-old money manager who founded New York Securities
Auction Corp. this year. Mr. Greenblatt had recruited
institutions such as Fidelity Investments, Mutual Shares
Corp. and Trust Co. of the West to list bonds for sale.

   People familiar with the auction said about $80 million
face value of bonds were offered for sale yesterday. Many
were distressed-company bonds that traded at big discounts to
their face value. Estimates were that about 40% of the bonds
attracted purchase bids, with about one-quarter of the bids
leading to actual sales.
   "I think we did pretty well," Mr. Greenblatt said. "We
traded enough to cover our costs." He added that some Wall
Street firms showed a willingness to use his system, even
though it competes with their bond-trading desks.
   "This is another tool for us" to use in bond trading, said
Howard Marks, a managing director at Trust Co. of the West.
Future weekly auctions may produce brisker volume, Mr. Marks
predicted.
