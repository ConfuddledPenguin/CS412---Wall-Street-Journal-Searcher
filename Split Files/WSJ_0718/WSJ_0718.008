   Reversing a general malaise in earnings, several big
regional banks reported record net income for the second
quarter and only modest increases in loan problems.
   Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One Corp. and Norwest Corp.,
Minneapolis, boasted record profits, with earnings rising 14%
and 12%, respectively.

   One-time gains on asset sales helped fuel results at San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Mellon Bank Corp.,
Pittsburgh. Wells Fargo's results gained 58%, and Mellon's
net more than doubled.
   Noting the positive response by the banks' share prices to
the news, Michael Plodwick, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence,
Morgan Grenfell Inc., said, "The quality banks -- and they're
few and far between -- are getting recognized."
   Meanwhile, major banks continued to struggle with rising
loan problems and weak commercial loan demand. Citicorp's
earnings were down 37%, in line with analysts' expectations,
as bad loans continued to rise. A $100 million restructuring
charge at Manufacturers Hanover Corp. resulted in a 69% drop
in earnings. And though Chemical Banking Corp. saw its loan
quality improve, earnings were off 12%.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Citicorp was up 12.5 cents, closing at $21.875. Manufacturers
Hanover closed at $31.625, up 75 cents. Chemical rose 37.5
cents to $24.375. Norwest fell 12.5 cents to $20.875.
   Wells Fargo gained $1.50 to close at $80.125. Mellon
closed at $25.875, up 37.5 cents. And Banc One rose 12.5
cents to $29.125.
                                                                                                       

   Citicorp

   Sluggish corporate finance activity in the U.S. coupled
with a hefty provision to cover possible loan losses combined
to produce another weak quarter for the U.S.'s biggest
banking company.
   Nonperforming assets, particularly commercial real estate
loans, climbed at a slower pace than at several of Citicorp's
big competitors that have reported earnings in recent days.
Commercial nonperforming assets, including foreclosed real
estate, climbed to $4.5 billion, up 24% from first-quarter
levels. Total nonperforming assets, including developing
country loans, stood at $8.4 billion at the quarter's end.
   Net charge-offs of commercial loans declined 32% to $92
million. Analysts found reassurance in the fact Citicorp's
charge-off for highly leveraged corporate loans was only $52
million in the quarter, slightly below the first-quarter
level. Federal bank examiners recently conducted a targeted
review of such loans, and some analysts had braced themselves
for an unpleasant surprise. Citicorp also wrote off $631
million of Brazilian loans, as required by federal
regulators.
   The loan-loss provision was $473 million, down from $570
million in the first quarter.
   Judah Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst, said:
"There were no outsized increases in any problem areas.
That's encouraging. Still, Citicorp has got to accelerate its
asset sales to rebuild capital, demonstrate further moderate
rises in problem real estate loans and bring its overhead
expenses for its commercial bank in North America into line
with its revenue."
   Meanwhile, Citicorp's robust global consumer banking
business, led by its credit cards and New York branch system,
continued to hum along, chalking up $266 million in profit, a
28% increase. Commercial banking in developing countries
posted a 44% increase in profit to $138 million.
   However, losses in the information business widened to $54
million, and earnings for commercial banking in Europe, North
America and Japan remained an anemic $42 million.
                                                                                                       

   Chemical Banking Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Bucking a general deterioration in loan quality, Chemical
reported an improvement in loan health. Nonperforming assets
fell $245 million to $3 billion, including $268.2 million in
mandated charge-offs of Brazilian and Argentine loans.
Excluding developing country loans, charge-offs totaled $63.7
million, about $12 million less than the year-earlier
quarter.
   Though higher than some analysts' estimates, Chemical's
results were below the year-ago level, despite a lower
loan-loss provision and lower tax expenses.
   Both interest income ($510.2 million) and non-interest
income ($338 million) fell from a year ago, primarily
reflecting the absence of interest payments from Brazil and
lower gains on venture capital investments. Also, the net
interest rate margin, or difference between what the bank
earns and pays on funds, widened to 3.18% from 3.02% in the
first quarter.
   Also counter to an industrywide trend, Chemical said its
corporate finance fees were "substantially" above the
first-quarter level.
                                                                                                       

   Manufacturers Hanover
                                                                                                       

   The restructuring will chop the payroll by 7%, or about
1,400 jobs, and lead to the closing or reduction in size of a
number of unspecified businesses. A spokesman wouldn't say
where the cuts would come. According to one bank executive,
staff at the bank's Geoserve unit, basically its data and
transaction processing business, will be trimmed 20%.
   Looking ahead, the cuts are expected to save about $125
million a year on a pretax basis. The company said the bulk
of those savings won't be realized until next year.
   Excluding the charge, Manufacturers earnings declined 12%
to $93 million from $106 million, reflecting slack corporate
loan demand and the absence of interest payments by Brazil
and Argentina.
   Nonperforming loans, excluding developing country loans,
climbed $84 million from first-quarter levels, or 10%, to
$915 million. It is believed that the increase is
attributable to $153 million in troubled loans to developer
Donald Trump. Total nonperforming loans slipped 14% to $2.47
billion, reflecting $450 million in charge-offs of loans to
Brazil and Argentina.
   The company's $83 million provision to loan-loss reserves
matched the net charge-offs for domestic loans.
   Commenting on the reserves, Chairman John F. McGillicuddy
said, "We believe that our reserve for possible credit losses
is adequate to cover risks inherent in the refinancing
country portfolio."
                                                                                                       

   Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Wells Fargo's earnings jumped because of a $116.5 million
pretax gain from the partial sale of its investment advisory
business to a joint venture with Nikko Securities Co., Japan.
Without the special gain, profit would risen 11% to $163.8
million, or $3.06 a share.
   Such "core" earnings growth in the current hostile bank
environment "is very good," said Donald Crowley, an analyst
for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.
   Wells Fargo's 29% return on assets, excluding the special
gain, is one of the two or three highest returns among big
U.S. banks.
   The main concerns about Wells Fargo relate to its large
portfolios of leveraged buy-out and commercial real estate
loans. Regulators recently completed an examination of the
LBO loans, and Wells Fargo reported a jump in nonaccruing LBO
credits to $292 million from $160 million in the previous
quarter.
   But nonperforming real estate assets didn't increase
overall, troubled construction loans fell, total
nonperforming assets increased by only $110 million, and "the
LBO examination has now come and gone," said Richard
Fredericks, an analyst for Montgomery Securities. Wells Fargo
also recently passed an examination of its commercial real
estate loans.
                                                                                                       

   Mellon Bank Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Earnings, excluding a $74 million gain on the sale of a
consumer finance unit, were flat at $68 million, or $1.19 a
share.
   Analysts said the results were in line with expectations,
but they differed on Mellon's performance. "In these
turbulent times in banking, relative stability is pretty
good," said Lacy Schockley, an analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. But Charles Cramner, an analyst at
Shearson Lehman, said: "It's a pretty weak quarter. The real
problem for Mellon is they aren't generating much in
revenue."
   Like most banks, Mellon was hurt by the deteriorating real
estate market. Mellon's nonperforming domestic real estate
loans surged 53% from the first quarter, to $330 million.
That increase was offset when Mellon removed from
nonperforming status its investment in Grant Street National
Bank's senior preferred stock. That move enabled Mellon to
take $71 million in assets off nonperforming status.
   Overall, nonperforming assets increased 5%, to $603
million.
   Frank V. Cahouet, Mellon's chairman and chief executive
officer, characterized the quarter as "a period of continued
progress," and he cited the completion in May of Mellon's
purchase of branch offices from Meritor Savings Bank as a
critical step in building the bank's Mid-Atlantic market.
                                                                                                       

   Banc One Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Banc One was bolstered by its growth in Texas, reporting
higher earnings despite a big increase in loss provisions to
cover bad real estate loans in the Midwest.
   Banc One also said it completed an offering of 10 million
shares, and most of the $282 million in proceeds will be used
to retire short-term debt. Despite the rise in nonperforming
loans, John B. McCoy, Banc One's chairman and chief executive
offering, said the stock offering wasn't a requirement by
bank regulators, but was a move to improve the company's
capital position.
                                                                                                       

   Norwest Corp.
                                                                                                       

   With $26.8 billion in assets at June 30, Norwest said
profit rose mostly because of a strong performance at the
national finance unit. Profit at Norwest's banking operations
was lower than planned, the company said, reflecting higher
loan losses.
   The company said net interest income surged 15% to $298.8
million from $259.2 million a year earlier, reflecting growth
in loans and other earning assets.
   Nonperforming assets edged up to $229.5 million from
$214.5 million at March 31. In the second quarter, Norwest
set aside $59.5 million for future loan losses and charged
off $67 million of loans.
   The reserve for losses stood at $321.3 million at June 30.
