   ZURICH -- Switzerland's trade deficit in June narrowed to
516 million francs ($363.9 million) from a revised May gap of
889 million francs, the government announced.
   In June 1989, the deficit was 974 million francs.

   While exports in June, at 7.6 billion francs, were little
changed from the levels in the previous month and in June
1989, imports slowed somewhat, to 8.18 billion francs in June
from 8.6 billion francs in May and 8.8 billion francs the
previous year.
