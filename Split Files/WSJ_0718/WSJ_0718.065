   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it will
challenge as a violation of federal antitrust law the
proposed sale by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. of a
Hollywood film laboratory to the British leisure and
entertainment firm Rank Organisation PLC.
   Twentieth Century is a unit of Fox Inc., which is owned by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. of Sydney, Australia.

   Rank's acquisition of Deluxe Laboratories "would tend
substantially to lessen competition" among specialized film
labs that serve the Hollywood movie studios, the department
said in a statement. The statement didn't say when or where
the department intended to file a lawsuit to try to block the
transaction, and officials weren't available to comment
further.
   Rank owns Film House Group Inc., a major Canadian film
lab. By acquiring Deluxe, Rank would control roughly half of
the $140 million U.S. market for producing prints of major
feature films, the Justice Department said.
   Fox Inc. issued a statement saying, "We intend to
vigorously resist the Justice Department challenge." Rank
agreed to acquire Deluxe in March for about $150 million in
cash.
   Rank, the largest processor of film in Europe, completed
its acquisition of Film House last April from Cineplex Odeon
Corp., which is 49%-owned by MCA Inc., paying about $113
million in a two-step transaction over two years. In 1988,
Rank paid about $120 million for a video-duplicating venture
from Bell &amp; Howell Co., Columbia Pictures Entertainment Co.
and Paramount Pictures Corp.
   Rank also owns a 50% stake of MCA Inc.'s new theme park,
Universal Studios Florida, which it also bought from Cineplex
Odeon, for $150 million.
   Rank's interests include Pinewood Studios in England,
movie production, distribution and exhibition, a giant film
library, hotels, restaurants and recreation facilities. Its
film and television businesses reported income of $61.8
million last year, about one-fourth of the companywide total,
on sales of $350.7 million.
