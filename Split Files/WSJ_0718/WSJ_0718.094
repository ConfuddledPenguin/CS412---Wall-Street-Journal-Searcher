   Tokyo stocks darted higher on arbitrage buying during the
last two minutes of trade, traders said.
   After wavering near 33000 points for most of the day, the
Nikkei Index shot up on buying linked to stock-index
arbitrage, performed by one of the Big Four Japanese
brokerage firms and by a U.S. brokerage firm giant, traders
said.

   In London, meanwhile, share prices closed higher but off
the day's best levels, as a midmorning romp higher ran out of
steam on mild profit-taking.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues advanced 150.55 points
to 33172.28 Tuesday. However, in early trading in Tokyo
Wednesday, the Nikkei retreated 75.08 points to 33097.20.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 600
million shares, in line with 609.9 million shares Monday.
   Winners outnumbered losers 505 to 409, while 217 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section added 7.15 points, or 0.30%, to 2407.31.
   The second section index retreated 45.66 points, or 1.02%,
to 4431.50. Volume was estimated at 24 million shares, down
from 33.7 million shares Monday.
   Traders said that trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has
neared a turning point, as volume has shifted away from
over-the-counter and second section shares, and as the value
of trading on the first section has improved moderately.
   Paul Muller, manager of international equity sales at
Schroder Securities, noted that the developing trend shows a
move out of smaller, short-term stocks and cautiously into
value-driven, medium-sized stocks.
   Kevin Haag, a trader in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities, added that interest is beginning to focus on
domestic, medium-capital construction and housing and other
issues.
   But, Mr. Haag noted, "it's still a little early for
large-caps," in which heavier volume is needed before a
strong recovery is seen on the Nikkei Index.
   With short-term interest rates remaining at high levels,
institutional investors are still reluctant to move funds
aggressively back into stocks, observers said.
   Meanwhile, rumors continue to surface on whether the Bank
of Japan will maintain its monetary policy and not raise the
official discount rate in the near future as central bank
Gov. Yasushi Mieno indicated would be the case on Monday.
   On the other hand, the stock market has grown a bit more
bullish, as eased U.S. rates from the Federal Reserve Board's
move Friday have taken some of the pressure off the yen.
Traders also noted that U.S. economic indicators and budget
data continue to show trouble ahead for the U.S.
   The traders pointed out that a sudden, large recovery
wouldn't be healthy for the market. But a steady transfer of
funds from short-term, small shares and money market
instruments into medium-scale holdings is viewed favorably.
   Before last-minute arbitrage buying, the Nikkei Index was
caught in a narrow range near 33000 points. The index wasn't
reflecting active buying on the larger shares, as investors
were selling their smaller holdings at the same time, traders
said.
   Benefiting from the buying were shares such as Kuraray, up
40 yen to 1600 yen (27 cents to $10.79), and Toray, up 17 yen
to 800 yen. Fuji Photo Film added 30 yen to 4950 yen.
   Medium-capital construction and housing shares were
popular. Nippon Hodo rose 110 yen to 3780 yen, Maeda
Construction added 100 yen to 2220 yen, Misawa Homes rose 70
yen to 2900 yen, and Sekisui House added 50 yen to 2150 yen.
   Pulp and paper issues were also higher. Jujo Paper gained
100 yen to 870 yen, while Oji Paper rose 50 yen to 1170 yen.
   But Sony slipped 100 yen to 8980 yen, TDK fell 160 yen to
7430 yen, and Fanuc dropped 100 yen to 7550 yen. Most other
high-technology blue chips were similarly lower.
   In London, shares shot higher in the early going, as an
overnight advance in New York inspired some fresh
position-taking in London. But the gains were short-lived, as
a mediocre opening on Wall Street and some second thoughts
about the U.K. economy gave way to selected profit-taking in
some of the blue-chip leaders.
   However, analysts were quick to add that they saw no heavy
selling pressure. "There's no real disinvestment going on,"
one director said. "People are hesitant to part with any
large lines of stock because they feel they'll have to buy it
back later at a higher price."
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
8.5 points to 2415, off the intraday peak of 2430.6. The
Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 12 points to 1912.9.
Volume was 493.6 million shares, compared with 346.9 million
issues a day earlier.
   Yesterday's biggest loser was Reuters, as dealers said one
large U.S. brokerage firm took the stock off its recommended
buy list. A total of 1.2 million shares changed hands as the
shares dropped 32 pence to #12.82 (58 cents to $23.10).
   Shell Transport &amp; Trading slipped 6 pence to 479 pence.
Brokerage firm Hoare Govett Ltd. in London cut second-quarter
profit estimates for the oil giant, with expectations for net
profit now at #890 million on a current cost basis compared
with a previous #940 million.
   The rest of the oil sector presented a mixed picture.
British Petroleum shed 5 pence to 331 pence, Enterprise was
unchanged at 658 pence, Lasmo slipped a penny to 415 pence,
Ultramar gained 6 pence to 340 pence, while Burmah shed 2
pence to 661 pence.
   In corporate news, food retailer Asda increased 4 pence to
119 pence after announcing pretax profit fell 27% last year.
Investors were relieved the result wasn't worse, said
analysts, in a year when the company spent #704 million on 60
Gateway stores and reorganized the group's distribution
system.
   Storehouse fell 3 pence to 123 pence. Sir Terence Conran,
former chairman, sold his 4.9% stake in the company.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris and
Amsterdam. Zurich and Madrid ended lower. Prices were mixed
in Milan, Frankfurt, Brussels and Stockholm. South African
gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Taipei, Wellington
and Manila, and lower in Hong Kong and Singapore. Seoul was
closed.
