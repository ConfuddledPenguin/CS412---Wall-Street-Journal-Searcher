   Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said it plans to begin
reorganizing its business footholds in the U.S. next month in
response to expansion as well as diversification of its local
business activity.
   As the primary change, officials said, Mitsubishi Electric
Sales America Inc. and Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc.
will merge, keeping the name of the latter.

   Until now, Mitsubishi Electric sales handled electric home
appliances, and Mitsubishi Electronics dealt with electronics
parts. However, Mitsubishi Electric noted a need to merge the
companies, as products like high-definition television blur
the boundaries between the two. The new company will be in
Cypress, Calif.
   In an attempt to better generate funds while hedging
exchange risks, Mitsubishi Electric will also establish a
finance company called Mitsubishi Electric Finance America
Inc. in Cypress. It will be capitalized at $3.3 million.
