   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department, which slashed the
allowable level of worker exposure to asbestos in 1986,
proposed reducing the limit again.
   Acting under a court order, the department's Occupational
Safety and Health Administration proposed cutting the
permissible exposure limit for asbestos in the workplace in
half. The new limit would be an average of 0.1 fiber per
cubic centimeter of air over an eight-hour period.

   The short-term limit would remain at an average of one
fiber per cubic centimeter of air over a 30-minute period.
   OSHA believes the proposed new level "will significantly
reduce worker deaths from cancer resulting from exposure to
asbestos," said Assistant Secretary of Labor Gerard Scannell,
who heads the agency. The standard would cover about 706,000
employees in general industry, mostly in auto repair, and as
many as 1.4 million workers in construction, including
building renovation and maintenance, OSHA said.
   In 1986, OSHA reduced the maximum level for asbestos from
two fibers to 0.2 fiber per cubic centimeter of air, but
labor unions sought a lower limit. A federal district court
in February 1988 told the agency to re-examine several
issues, including the maximum permissible exposure level.
   Responding to the court order, OSHA also proposed
requirements for specific controls over asbestos in
activities such as automobile brake and clutch service,
regardless of the exposure level. It also proposed requiring
owners of buildings in which demolition, renovation and
asbestos-removal are conducted to notify employers, workers
and OSHA of activities involving asbestos and how they plan
to trim exposure risks.
   The agency also proposed to expand a requirement that
construction companies employ individuals trained to ensure
compliance with the standard; to require more stringent
cleanup by asbestos-removal companies; to ban high-speed
buffing of asbestos floor tile; to narrow an exemption for
small-scale, short-duration operations; and to add limited
exemptions for roofing, floor-tile removal and operations in
which it isn't feasible to erect a protective enclosure for
workers.
   The proposal would eliminate a requirement that employers
begin monitoring workers' health when exposure to asbestos is
at half the maximum level allowed. OSHA said it doesn't
believe it's technologically feasible to measure exposure at
half the proposed level of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of
air. So, it will continue to require monitoring at the 0.1
fiber level.
   OSHA proposed allowing manufacturers to use respiratory
equipment for workers to meet the reduced levels until those
employers can no longer use asbestos under a planned
phase-out of the material in manufacturing. The Environmental
Protection Agency has ordered the phase-out, which is due to
be in full effect in August 1996. Construction firms would
have to use engineering controls.
   OSHA will accept comments on the proposal postmarked
through Sept. 25, and it plans a hearing on Oct. 23.
