   LOS ANGELES -- The high-end faucet business treated
Barbara Nyden Rodstein nicely.
   Friends dubbed her "faucet queen to the stars," as her
fancy fixtures found their way into the Reagan White House
and the homes of Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Barbra
Streisand. And she is to be featured in a segment of
television's "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" that will
show off her Bel Air home, brightly colored designer clothes
and two Rolls-Royces.

   But lately, she also has been learning a tough business
lesson: Shopping your small company to a big competitor can
land you in hot water.
   The lesson began when Ms. Nyden Rodstein's negotiations to
sell her bath-fixtures company, Harden Industries Inc., to
Nortek Inc. fell through in 1988. Ms. Nyden Rodstein is now
locked in a legal battle with Nortek in which she claims that
the Providence, R.I., manufacturing conglomerate stole her
company's top-selling faucet designs and tried to drive her
out of business.
   Says Ms. Nyden Rodstein of her experience with Nortek:
"It's like they're going after a butterfly with a hammer."
   Nortek executives declined to comment for this story,
citing company policy about discussing continuing litigation.
But in court filings, the company has denied Harden's
allegations, which include trademark infringement,
misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition.
Nortek's chairman and chief executive, Ralph Papitto, has
said in filings in federal court here that Harden's case "is
built on outrageous lies and unfounded speculation."
   Harden's claims aren't uncommon for a small company that
tries to sell itself to a big one. The courts are filled with
lawsuits by entrepreneurs who allege that a potential buyer
stole their secrets or roughed them up in other ways.
   Nortek first approached Harden about a possible sale in
April, 1987, shortly before Ms. Nyden Rodstein's husband and
co-manager of the company, Harvey Rodstein, died of cancer.
Mr. Papitto said that he was looking "to purchase a company
which produced `top-of-the-line bathroom faucets and
fixtures,'" to complement Nortek's lower-priced
Universal-Rundle unit, Harden claims in its lawsuit, filed in
March 1989 in federal court here. Harden agreed to discuss an
acquisition and entered into a confidentiality agreement with
Nortek allowing the big company to pore over Harden's
financial records, marketing and sales plans, and lists of
sales representatives, customers and suppliers.
   Shortly after the acquisition talks began, Mr. Papitto
"insisted upon and secured the opportunity to tour the
manufacturing facilities in Taiwan of Harden's principal
supplier," Ming Chin Enterprise Co., the complaint alleges.
Harden claims that even while acquisition talks were
continuing, Nortek "secretly contracted with Ming Chin . . .
to purchase Harden's top-selling lines of faucets and
bathroom fixtures," and sell them as its own.
   The acquisition talks broke down in January 1988 after
Nortek lowered the price it was willing to pay for Harden.
"When our audit was completed, we discovered that Harden's
profitability was only about half of that which had been
orally represented to us," Mr. Papitto said in the court
filings.
   By July, Nortek had set up its own upscale bath fixtures
company, Raphael Ltd., and began selling faucets made by Ming
Chin, which had stopped doing business with Harden the month
after negotiations with Nortek fell apart. (Harden claims in
court filings that Ming Chin's work became suspiciously
shoddy in the months before the acquisition talks ceased.
Ming Chin has sued Harden claiming Harden hasn't paid it
nearly $1.8 million. Harden denies that it owes Ming Chin the
money.)
   Harden says it was particularly irked that Ming Chin was
making faucets for Raphael with Harden molds. Nortek doesn't
deny that Ming Chin used the molds, but says they are the
property of Ming Chin, not Harden, and that it was therefore
free to use them.
   Raphael did, however, instruct the Taiwanese supplier to
"obliterate all evidence of the Harden name before shipping
the fixtures to Raphael," and even bought a grinding wheel
for the purpose, according to Nortek's statements in the
case. Nortek concedes that "Raphael has inadvertently, and to
its considerable dismay, shipped a handful of fixtures which
did bear the Harden trademark."
   The result has been chaos for Harden, Ms. Nyden Rodstein
says. "Our retailers are confused. They look at a faucet and
they don't know whose it is." She says quality control and
product liability are big concerns. "If there's a problem
with a Raphael faucet, my reputation suffers." Harden now
requires customers to show proof of purchase when they have
complaints about a product. "We never had to do that before,"
she says.
   In addition to using the same molds, Raphael featured
pictures of all of Harden's top-selling faucets in its own
catalog and lured away several of Harden's sales
representatives, Harden's suit alleges. To get Harden's
customers to buy Raphael products, "defendants informed
Harden's customers that Harden was `going out of business,'
or `into bankruptcy' and that Raphael had purchased the
leftover inventory of Harden faucets," the suit adds. Nortek
has denied those allegations.
   Ms. Nyden Rodstein says her company has been especially
battered by the rumors that it is closing shop, resulting in
"a serious decline in our business," though she won't
quantify it. Her attorney, Jerald R. Cochran, says only that
Harden has made a "$10.5 million settlement demand" to
Nortek, excluding attorney's fees. Barring a settlement, the
case will probably go to trial next March, Mr. Cochran says.
   Still, Ms. Nyden Rodstein says that "the biggest and most
horrendous part is behind us." In federal court here, Harden
won a preliminary injunction against Nortek last year to stop
distributing faucets bearing Harden's name. Harden also
introduced a new line of streamlined fixtures called
"Metropolis" that "wouldn't be confused with anyone else's,"
Ms. Nyden Rodstein says. And she was named businesswoman of
the year by the Los Angeles chapter of the National
Association of Women Business Owners in March.
   Ms. Nyden Rodstein, who talks of having been "too poor to
even have a doll" during her childhood in Chicago, was
involved in male-dominated industries including trucking and
pneumatic tools before starting Harden in 1982 with a $5,000
investment. She says that venture began after she went
hunting for faucets for her husband's dressing room and
realized there was profit to be had in high-end bathroom
fixtures. "Brass was selling for just 35 cents a pound, and
yet a six-pound solid-brass faucet was selling for $350," she
says.
   Having to struggle up through some tough industries, she
says, may be to her advantage in the tussle with Nortek.
"Stuff like this can ruin your lunch," she says.
