   DENVER -- Newmont Gold Co. said it reduced its production
costs at some of its operations and mines in Nevada,
countering an industry trend of rising costs. It also said it
will increase production of gold to 1.7 million ounces in
1990, up from a projected 1.54 million ounces.
   The company also said it repaid all its debt to its banks
and its 90% owner, Newmont Mining Co., in the second quarter.
Newmont Gold had about $83.7 million in short-term debt on
March 31.

   The company declined to estimate second-quarter earnings,
but a spokesman said results will "probably be better than
most estimates." Net income was $27.8 million, or 27 cents a
share, on sales of about $139 million, a year earlier.
   The nation's largest gold producer said it has increased
productivity, lowered supply costs and improved recovery
rates in its northern area mines and mills of the Carlin
Trend, a rich gold-bearing formation in north-central Nevada.
The company said its cash costs of producing an ounce of gold
fell below the $224 reported for the first quarter.
   For the second half, the company projects its cash costs
per ounce of gold will average about $200, and the average
cost for the year will be about $210. The company had
projected its cash costs would be about $240 an ounce for the
year.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Newmont Gold
shares rose 75 cents to $45.25. Newmont Mining shares rose
62.5 cents to $46.75.
   The reduction in mining cost "is very unique," said John
Tumazos, analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He figures
the average pretax cost of mining an ounce of gold (including
cash costs and non-cash expenses) has increased steadily over
the past three years to about $330 an ounce from about $250
an ounce. Gold mining costs have increased because of higher
prices for cyanide and other reagents, higher taxes in
Nevada, stricter environmental controls and higher
exploration costs, he said.
