   A Southern Co. unit lost a round in its elated to Georgia
Power Co.'s Vogtle plant. Georgia Power filed the appeal
following a lower court's decision to uphold the
disallowance, which the commission said was justified in
light of certain "imprudent and excessive" costs.
   A Georgia Power spokesman said his company was reviewing
the latest court decision and hadn't decided whether it would
appeal. He said the company can ask the appeals court to
reconsider its decision, and if Georgia Power loses there, it
can still appeal to the state supreme court.

   If Georgia Power ultimately loses, Atlanta-based Southern
has said it would have to take an after tax write-off of
about $200 million. That would be in addition to a $229
million write-off taken in 1987, after the total budget for
the plant exceeded a self-imposed cap.
