   NEW YORK -- Not yet.
   For the third consecutive trading session, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average poked above 3000 but failed to hold its
ground at the close. Yesterday, the industrials spent most of
the morning above 3000, then fell below as investors
collected profits in stocks that had led the now-ended
four-day run-up.

   In the last half-hour of trading, program buying sent the
industrials on a frenzied 20-point dash back to just above
the 3000 level, but they slipped at the final bell. The
average finished unchanged at 2999.75, echoing the record set
Monday. Broader market measures closed lower.
   Bonds were little changed, and the dollar ended lower,
both in light activity, with investors finding little
motivation in yesterday's economic news to trade. Most of the
action in currency markets was centered on non-dollar trades.
   Several stocks with big gains during the four-day rally,
which in retrospect ended Monday, were attracting a lot of
sell orders yesterday. Among them: Nike, Wal-Mart Stores and
Compaq Computer.
   A.C. Moore, research director at Argus Research, cited
profit-taking and a directionless bond market for the failure
of stock prices to continue pushing higher. Program trading
was a wash, pushing prices lower in the afternoon and then
abruptly higher at the close. Much of the late program buying
was related to Chicago futures trading in the Major Market
Index, which mimics the Dow industrials.
   "It's been a very heady couple of days," said Andrew
Riley, head of U.S. equity research at Yamaichi
International, "so it shouldn't be any surprise that the
market" didn't continue advancing to new records. In the four
sessions ended Monday, the Dow industrials climbed 108
points, or 3.8%.
   In effect, "We've made the 3000 mark," Mr. Riley added.
"It doesn't matter any more. It will waffle back and forth,
stand back, then go higher. The interesting thing is that the
volume came back as this move up started" late yesterday.
Volume totaled 176.8 million shares, up from 149.4 million
Monday.
   Peter Canelo, chief strategist at Bear Stearns, said one
key to a higher market is the dollar. "It has shown a bit of
weakness, and that keeps the international investor from
coming in," he said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks were mostly lower. Decliners outnumbered advancers,
877 to 643.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year
bond held at 8.45%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, it was quoted
at 1.6440 marks and 147.80 yen, compared with 1.6547 marks
and 148.15 yen Monday.
