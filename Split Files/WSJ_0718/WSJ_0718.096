   McLEAN, Va. -- Cordatum Inc. said it has filed for
financial reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, citing pending tax liens and inability to
arrange refinancing.
   At the same time, Cordatum's two principal stockholders
sued the company in U.S. District Court in Eastern Virginia,
claiming fraud and securities and exchange violations.

   Cordatum, a high-technology and professional services
company, said it is unable to negotiate repayment of a
$150,000 loan from Signet Bank in Baltimore, Md., and that it
owes the Internal Revenue Service approximately $45,000 in
unpaid taxes, penalties and interest for fiscal years 1985
through 1989.
   The company said that three directors resigned this
morning, along with the acting chief financial officer, Bill
A. Short. The directors were Richard S. Hickok, James S.
Gracey and George G. King. Messrs. Hickok and King were named
to the board last February.
   The two principal stockholders, Commonwealth Acquisitions
Inc. and Trautman &amp; Co., claimed in a federal lawsuit that
the company and its former chief executive officer, Merle C.
Garvis, concealed "material information concerning taxes and
other obligations" in connection with the company's initial
securities offering in August 1989. Commonwealth and Trautman
control 88% of Cordatum.
   The suit seeks $10 million in compensatory and punitive
damages. Mr. Garvis could not be reached for comment.
