   PROSPECTS brighten for physician assistants, a career
category the Labor Department pegs for 28% job growth in this
decade.
   PAs, who must work under a doctor's supervision, tackle
about 70% of typical medical procedures, such as physical
exams and patient histories, freeing up doctors for more
complex tasks. They're allowed to prescribe medicine in 26
states. Specialized PAs even stitch up patients after
surgeons finish operating.
   Enrollment in two-year PA courses, after ebbing for
several years, increased 10.4% last year, according to a
University of Iowa study. The U.S. has 52 accredited
programs, and about 22,000 graduates are already practicing.
The American Academy of Physician Assistants, Alexandria,
Va., says most PAs work in group practices or in hospitals.
   "In practical terms, a PA acts like a physician at a
fraction of a physician's salary," says Dr. A.S. Freedberg,
who worked with a PA at Harvard University Medical School's
Boston health clinic.
   The lower salaries offer a cost-effective way for
physicians to expand their practices, says the American
Medical Association in Chicago. Many PAs earn about $35,000
to $45,000 a year, similar to the range for nurse
practitioners. A general practice doctor earns about $94,600.
   The government also reaps cost savings from PAs. Work done
by PAs in hospitals and nursing homes is reimbursed at a
lower rate by Medicare. Providers using PAs are reimbursed at
par or slightly below a physician's fee in 41 state-run
Medicaid programs.
   PAs are sought not only by crowded city hospitals, but by
rural clinics. Many PAs, saddled with less tuition debt than
doctors, can afford to work in communities of up to 250,000
people.
                                                                                                       

   Home Intravenous Care
   Catches On Rapidly
                                                                                                       

   GIVING patients intravenous treatments in their homes
costs 25% to 50% less than similar care in hospitals,
analysts say.
   Patients pay about $300 to $350 a day for home nutrition
infusions. By contrast, the average patient bill at community
hospitals in the U.S. is about $789 a day, says the Health
Insurance Association of America, a Washington-based trade
group of 320 commercial health insurers.
   In the past decade, the home-treatment industry has grown
rapidly as more patients opt for antibiotics, chemotherapy
and nutrition care at home and more doctors gain confidence
in the service. Analysts expect the market to hit $2.5
billion next year.
   "We're finding the fastest-growing segment is in
antibiotic {and antiviral} treatments, especially in the last
year because of AIDS treatments," says a spokesman for
Caremark Homecare, a unit of Baxter International Inc. in
Deerfield, Ill., that claims about a third of the market.
   The home treatments are started by a visiting nurse, who
sets a catheter in a patient's arm or leg and teaches the
patient how to connect a feeding tube, for example, from a
nutrition drip. The prescribing doctor receives and monitors
reports from the nurse.
   "If the patient is stable, home infusion is cheaper,
because there isn't the hospital overhead," says Neal
Bradsher, medical analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. Casts a Cold Eye
   On Prostate Expenses
                                                                                                       

   CONVENTIONAL surgery for swollen prostate glands is
targeted by the U.S. as an "overpriced procedure."
   The federal Health Care Financing Administration, which
sets prices for Medicare payments, complains that the
procedure typically costs about $3,594 to $5,513, plus
surgeon fees.
   Urologists say the condition, which doesn't always lead to
surgery, affects about 50% of men by age 60 and 80% to 90% by
age 80. As the population ages and even more men are
affected, pressure seems sure to increase from Medicare and
private insurers to lower treatment costs.
   Mary Ellen McCarthy, pharmaceutical analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, predicts these pressures will drive down
expenditures for prostate surgery by 1995 to about $3.4
billion from about $4.8 billion, while alternative treatments
will grow to about $1 billion from $30 million.
   In anticipation of this shift, less-invasive procedures
are cropping up. Intra-Sonix Inc., Burlington, Mass., awaits
federal approval for its miniaturized ultrasound and laser
technology that surgeons would use to visualize the shape and
size of the prostate and then to zap it with a cauterizing
laser beam. The targeted tissue is discarded by the body in
two to three weeks.
   The Intra-Sonix procedure is estimated to take 10 minutes,
requiring one day in the hospital and costing about $1,000,
plus surgeon fees. By contrast, the 368,000 conventional
surgeries done last year averaged a one-hour operation and
6.4 recovery days in a hospital, says the American College of
Surgeons in Chicago.
   Rival treatments that show promise are enzyme-blocking
drugs to shrink the prostate, hyperthermia to heat the tissue
and a balloon device that squeezes the prostate from within
the urethra to widen the passage.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   HEALTH INSURANCE brokers and employee-benefits consultants
overwhelmingly expect the trend toward managed care, or
third-party review of primary-physician care, will keep
expanding through the 1990s, according to a survey
commissioned by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. . . . Top
executives of large hospitals earn 90% of the base pay of
corporate executives and 83% of total cash compensation,
concludes a poll by William M. Mercer Inc. of 168 executives
in the largest U.S. hospitals.
