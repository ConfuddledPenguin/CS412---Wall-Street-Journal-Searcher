   SOLON, Ohio -- Keithley Instruments Inc., which makes
electronic test and measurement instruments, said that for
its third quarter ended June 30, it expects to post a decline
in per-share earnings from the year-earlier 17 cents, when
net income was $611,000. It didn't specify earnings but said
sales rose 5% to $24.2 million from $23.2 million.
   Keithley cited higher operating expenses and a higher tax
rate for the earnings decline. The company said orders were
lower than expected and slightly below those of a year
earlier, principally because of a weak semiconducter market.
