   MAN AG said that sales for the year ended June 30 climbed
11% to about 19 billion marks ($11.48 billion) and that it
will raise its dividend.
   The West German engineering concern didn't specify to what
level it would raise the dividend, but said it would be the
third increase in three years.

   Meanwhile, MAN said it has accepted the West German
Federal Cartel office's decision forbidding the company from
taking over the Spanish truck maker Empresa Nacional de
Autocaminoes S.A. in partnership with Daimler-Benz AG.
   MAN had planned to acquire a 60% stake in Enasa from the
Spanish state holding company Instituto Nacional de
Industria, which would retain 20% and also acquire an 8%
share in MAN. Daimler would buy the remaining 20% stake and
manage Enasa jointly with MAN, but the Cartel Office rejected
the agreement due to the joint management element.
   No details were provided on earnings for 1990, but MAN
said capacity was "fully utilized" last year, which led to a
"renewed improvement" in earnings.
   In the year earlier, MAN's group net profit rose 25% to
about 252 million marks from 201.7 million marks a year
earlier.
