   TOKYO -- Japan's longstanding taboo on rice imports
suffered another blow, as a high-ranking member of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party said at least some easing of the
import ban appears to be inevitable.
   Toshio Yamaguchi, chairman of an LDP research committee on
economic adjustment issues, specifically suggested allowing
imports to meet up to 5% of Japan's domestic demand within
the next few years, according to reports in major Japanese
newspapers. Mr. Yamaguchi's comments constituted the most
specific endorsement so far by an LDP leader of some
liberalization of the rice market, at a time when opinion
surveys have shown a majority of the general public backing
such a move. Opening the market for Japan's traditional food
staple was widely considered almost sacrilegious just a few
years ago, and has become an increasingly central issue in
U.S.-Japan trade relations.

   An aide to Mr. Yamaguchi said over the weekend he couldn't
confirm the exact wording of Mr. Yamaguchi's remarks, which
came at a seminar Friday for industrialists and government
officials in the summer resort town of Karuizawa. But the
aide also made no effort to deny the gist of the remarks --
which touched off angry reactions from party officials
involved in agricultural policy. Japanese newspapers reported
over the weekend that Mr. Yamaguchi, when confronted by two
former agriculture ministers and another senior party
official, politely refused to retract his statement.
   Officials at LDP headquarters said Mr. Yamaguchi's
comments reflected his personal views, and insisted that the
party's support for the import ban is unchanged. But Mr.
Yamaguchi's statement appeared to be consistent with recent
indications that some government leaders are moving to pave
the way for a shift in official policy.
   Barriers to agricultural trade will be at the center of
the current round of multinational trade talks in coming
months. And Japanese press reports from the summit meeting in
Houston indicated that Japanese officials were interpreting
the carefully worded communique on agricultural issues to be
consistent with partial liberalization of rice trade.
   According to the reports, President Bush for the first
time personally raised the rice issue with Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu in Houston. Mr. Kaifu, in Colorado Springs
following the summit, told Japanese reporters over the
weekend that Mr. Bush hadn't made any specific demands. But
Mr. Kaifu also indicated that other countries weren't willing
to accept the Japanese argument that the need for "food
security" justifies the rice import ban.
   Mr. Kaifu, who was widely quoted during elections earlier
this year as promising to import "not one grain of rice," may
feel politically secure enough to consider moderating that
position partly because of other public-relations victories
achieved at the summit. Mr. Kaifu gained at least tacit
acceptance of Japan's decision to resume government aid to
China. And he won public acknowledgement of the importance of
settling Japan's territorial claims against the Soviet Union,
stemming from Soviet occupation of four small islands off the
coast of northern Japan at the end of World War II -- an
emotionally charged issue in Japan.
   Hints that political leaders were trying to lay the
groundwork for a shift on the rice policy began last month,
when Komeito, an opposition party often allied with the LDP,
said it would consider supporting partial liberalization of
the market. Noboru Takeshita, a powerful former prime
minister, publicly praised the Komeito stance as
"courageous," which some observers took as a sign that the
LDP was preparing to soften its position.
   Whether Mr. Kaifu or other officials will be courageous
enough to satisfy U.S. advocates of agricultural trade reform
is another question. The limited opening suggested by Mr.
Yamaguchi would allow imports of around 500,000 tons of rice,
based on recent consumption levels in Japan. U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter was quoted over the weekend by the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest economic newspaper, as
saying that opening only 5% of the rice market wouldn't be
acceptable.
