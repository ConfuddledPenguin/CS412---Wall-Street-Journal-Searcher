   Live Entertainment Inc., a Van Nuys, Calif., maker and
retailer of entertainment software products, joins the big
board Wednesday, under the symbol LVE. It previously traded

   Nuevo Energy Co., an independent oil and gas company based
in Houston, began trading last week as an initial public
offering under NEV.
                                                                                                       

   Joining the Amex, Essex Financial Partners L.P., a
Virginia Beach, Va., multistate savings and loan holding
company, begins trading limited partnership units on Tuesday,
under ESX.
                                                                                                       

   Foundation Health Corp., a Rancho Cordova, Calif., managed
health care services company, began trading last week as an
initial public offering under FH.
                                                                                                       

   Helionetics Inc., a maker of electronic power conditioning
products in Irvine, Calif., began trading under ZAP. It also
trades on the Pacific Stock Exchange, and previously traded
over-the-counter.
                                                                                                       

   Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a French pharmaceutical and chemical
company, began trading contingent value rights on a
"when-issued" basis, under RCV.WI.
                                                                                                       

   Tecogen Inc., a Waltham, Mass., maker of packaged
co-generation systems and gas-fueled air conditioners, which
previously traded over-the-counter, begins trading Thursday,
under TGN.
                                                                                                       

   Universal Zoltronics Corp, a Mt. Kisco, N.Y., maker of
high-voltage power conversion systems, which also previously
traded over-the-counter, begins trading Thursday, under UVL.

   The contingent value rights are being issued in connection
with Rhone-Poulenc's purchase of a majority stake in Rorer
Group Inc., on the basis of one right for each share not
owned by Rhone-Poulenc. The Amex expects them to be
distributed by the end of the month, when Rorer will be
renamed Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc. In the event the shares of
this company are trading below $98.26 on July 31, 1993, the
right requires Rhone Poulenc to pay holders the difference,
to a maximum $46.26 a right. The rights would cease trading
on that date, unless Rhone Poulenc extends them one year with
a maximum value of $44.14.
                                                                                                       

   Separately, the Chicago Board Options Exchange said
Cadence Design Systems Inc., a San Jose, Calif., maker of
software for integrated circuit design automation, and UJB
Financial Corp., a Princeton, N.J., banking company began
trading under CDQ and UJB, respectively.

   CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS being issued on the American Stock
Exchange in connection with Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of
a majority stake in Rorer Group Inc. are scheduled for August
distribution. Their maximum value at July 31, 1994, if Rorer
extends them one year, would be $54.12 each. Yesterday's
edition incorrectly stated the distribution date and maximum
value.
