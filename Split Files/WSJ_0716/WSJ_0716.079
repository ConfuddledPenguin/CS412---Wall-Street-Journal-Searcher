   PARIS -- Two of the siblings who had fought for control of
the famed Gallimard publishing house have agreed to sell
their shares to a bank, setting the stage for the family to
lose majority control, an investment firm said Friday.
   Terms weren't disclosed. If the sale is completed, it
would place 54.3% of the shares in France's largest
independent publishing house in outside hands, marking the
end of 79 years of family control.

   Francoise Gallimard and her brother, Christian, have
agreed to join their younger sister, Isabelle, in selling
their shares to the state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris,
according the international investment bank Henry Ansbacher.
   Ansbacher was retained by Francoise in January to
determine the value of the publishing house.
   Francoise, 49, and Christian, 46, had been trying to wrest
control of the company away from another brother, Antoine,
42, the firm's president and its largest single shareholder.
   According to Ansbacher, Francoise and Christian decided to
follow their younger sister's example by selling their
shares, giving Banque Nationale de Paris a total of 36.8% of
the Gallimard shares. Other outside shareholders control
17.5%.
