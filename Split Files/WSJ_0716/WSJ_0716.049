   This takes the cake. House Democrats Friday, in the name
of fiscal responsibility, voted to freeze the office expenses
appropriated for former Presidents. Rep. Andy Jacobs was
bellowing something about "millionaires." Tension between the
executive and Congress is natural, but it seems more than a
little gratuitous for these Members to be reaching back to
whack four American Presidents.
