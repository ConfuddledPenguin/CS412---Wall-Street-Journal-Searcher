   PARIS -- Bernard Tapie and his lead banker are promising
today to confound the skeptics who said he would have trouble
completing his takeover of West German sporting goods giant
Adidas AG.
   After a week's negotiations, his lead banker said it has
arranged the financing package that Mr. Tapie had said he
would disclose today. Credit Lyonnais's Societe de Banque
Occidentale unit announced Friday that it has more offers of
funds than Mr. Tapie needs. (One of Mr. Tapie's other main
banks, Credit Agricole, said Friday that it didn't have
enough information to make a decision.)

   Although Mr. Tapie has refused so far to disclose the
price of the Adidas purchase, it seems likely to be well
above the 889 million French franc ($160.5 million) market
valuation of Bernard Tapie Finance S.A., his main holding
company. So far, the flamboyant French financier hasn't
explained how he will fund the takeover or how it will affect
his other companies.
   Because of that, French securities regulators last week
ordered trading suspended in Bernard Tapie Finance and its
two listed subsidiaries, industrial scale-makers Terraillon
S.A. and Testut S.A. It was after the suspension that Mr.
Tapie promised to disclose financial details today.
