   Anti-nuclear politics are influencing purchases of medical
equipment at some hospitals.
   Upset over General Electric Co.'s involvement in the
manufacture of nuclear materials for weapons, Huguley
Memorial Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, purchased $2.7
million of diagnostic equipment from a GE competitor. For the
same reason, Central Kansas Medical Center in Great Bend,
Kan., shunned GE medical equipment and made orders of about
$1.8 million with another manufacturer.

   "GE's nuclear involvement played a 100% role in our
decision," says Roger Baker, the head of the radiology
department at Huguley Memorial Hospital. Based on his
recommendations, he says, the hospital administrators last
year purchased a CT scanner from Philips N.V., a Dutch
company, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine from
Diasonics Inc., whose MRI business now is owned by Toshiba
Corp. "Under no circumstances would I have accepted GE
machines. If it would have come to that, I would have put my
job on the line," he says.
   Such boycotts are part of a campaign started by a Boston
activist group, Infact, in June 1986. The group has published
a list of nine hospitals around the country that it says are
shunning GE medical equipment, at an estimated loss of $7.2
million since the boycott began. (Infact says the boycott has
spread to GE's appliances and light bulbs as well. It
estimates the total impact at $60 million.)
   However, other manufacturers to which hospitals are
turning, including Philips and Siemens AG, are also defense
contractors. "It is a difficult situation," concedes a
spokesman for Physicians for Social Responsibility, a group
of doctors and health-care professionals based in Washington
that endorsed the GE boycott last September. "But it's
important to single out one company to send a message to all
others. We also realized that because GE has substantial
business in medical equipment in the U.S., the boycott would
be effective."
   GE declines to discuss details of the boycott, saying the
impact has been negligible. Nevertheless, the Fairfield,
Conn., company, with annual revenue of $55 billion, is
concerned enough that its marketing managers accompany
salesmen in negotiations with hospitals that raise the
nuclear issue. "The salespeople aren't the best qualified to
present our position in this matter," says Ford Slater, a GE
spokesman.
   GE's position, he says, is that the company is "simply
following the nation's defense policy." Mr. Slater says the
marketing people also underscore GE's involvement in
community and philanthropic activities to show GE as a
company concerned with community welfare, not one
contaminating the environment with radiation, as the
activists claim.
   GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr. asserted at the company's
stockholder meeting recently that it was the nation's "strong
defense policy" in the 1980s that "brought about the changes,
to a great extent, in Eastern Europe. And we are proud of the
part that we played in participating in that change."
   The boycott has raised the question of whether health care
is being compromised by anti-nuclear policy at the boycotting
hospitals. GE, which has a dominant share of the medical
diagnostic equipment market in the U.S., asserts it is. "We
believe that GE medical systems are used by so many
health-care institutions because they were judged on their
capacity to help provide a superior level of patient care,
and that this is the proper criterion for evaluating such
technology," GE says in letters it has sent to some
hospitals. "Quality of care will surely suffer if political
criteria are substituted."
   Mr. Baker, the radiologist at the Huguley Memorial
Hospital, disagrees. Other machines "are just as good," he
says. "The images {produced by the machines} are a little
different. It's something you get used to." Moreover, he
says, the Diasonic MRI machine was priced $250,000 lower than
GE's, and the Philips CT machine it purchased was $500,000
lower. Still, he says, "there was a lot of pressure from the
members of the hospital administration committee to buy GE"
because other hospitals in the area had purchased GE
machines.
   Mr. Baker says the hospital committee investigated
diagnostic machines made by all major manufacturers and
eventually "accepted my recommendations."
   Central Kansas Hospital leased its MRI machine from
Diasonics in the fall of 1989, at a cost of $1.4 million over
five to seven years. "We did take performance as one of our
criteria. We wouldn't buy equipment that was inferior," says
Gemma Doll, a Dominican sister who was the head of the
hospital board when it decided to boycott GE equipment.
   "GE sent its representatives to try to convince us to buy
their machines," she says. "They pointed out GE's community
activities. But we felt we had to take a stance."
   A shareholder proposal calling for GE to get out of the
nuclear business -- it makes neutron "triggers" for weapons
and nuclear fuels for commercial power plants -- has come up
at GE annual meetings in one form or another every year since
1980. The proposals have never managed to garner more than
10% of the vote cast at the meetings. At the stockholder
meeting in April, the latest proposal received 6.2% of the
votes.
   But the nuclear issue dominated the public discussion
portion of the meeting. Despite a repeated urging by Mr.
Welch that shareholders move on to another topic, activists
persisted. Says a spokesman for Infact, where three dozen
full-time staff are involved in the GE boycott: "It's a
campaign that won't go away."
