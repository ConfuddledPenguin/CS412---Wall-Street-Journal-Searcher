   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The government raised active
interest rates, or the rates banks charge on loans, to 43%
Friday, a 10 percentage-point rise.
   Officials said passive rates should rise above 35%.
Passive rates are what banks pay the consumer on savings
accounts and money-market funds.

   The move was designed to stop the decline of the bolivar,
which in the past two weeks has fallen to record levels,
stopping just short of 50 bolivares to the dollar. The
government hopes the higher interest rates will encourage
investment in savings accounts and money-market funds, and
slow dollar purchases, the central bank said.
   The government slashed active interest rates only six
months ago, saying that the bolivar was stable at about 42 to
the dollar. But when banks began paying passive interest
rates of as low as 20% -- while inflation is running at about
35% -- people began to buy dollars instead.
