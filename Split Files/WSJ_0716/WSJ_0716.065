   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Armed Services Committee's $289
billion defense spending bill takes some cautious first steps
toward slimming down the military, but it avoids the most
painful budget-cutting decisions confronting the Pentagon.
   Despite voting to eliminate 100,000 active-duty troops,
more than 42,000 civilian jobs and $10 billion of new
hardware purchases in fiscal 1991, the committee postponed
final decisions on how, or even whether, to proceed with
major weapons programs.

   The bill, announced last Friday, delays full-scale
development or procurement of the Air Force's C-17 troop
transport and Advanced Tactical Fighter, a fleet of new
carrier-based attack planes and superquiet attack submarines
envisioned by the Navy, and the Army's proposed LH
helicopter.
   Lawmakers said the cuts reflected a new "fly before you
buy" strategy intended to more thoroughly test equipment
before it enters full-blown production.
   Significantly, though, none of these top-priority programs
-- carrying a total price tag of about $200 billion by the
late 1990s -- were killed. Neither the lawmakers' comments
nor documents released by the panel indicate the committee's
long-term intentions involving those high-profile weapons.
   Likewise, the panel sidestepped thorny questions about
long-term troop withdrawals from Europe, South Korea and
elsewhere -- all of which are bound to be hotly debated as
the bill winds its way through Congress. The committee did
mandate bringing home 50,000 American troops from Europe by
the end of 1991. But Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) said GOP
opposition blocked his bid to lock in deeper troop cuts there
by 1995. "We are going to revisit that again on the floor,"
he told reporters.
   Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) described the committee's
spending plan as a "manageable glide path toward a major
restructuring of our military establishment and the way it
does business." The committee cut $18 billion in spending
authority from President Bush's defense budget for the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1. But critics in the House and even some
members of his own committee are pushing for between $3
billion and $6 billion in additional cuts.
   The panel realized some relatively easy savings by
canceling more than a dozen smaller programs, including a
troubled air-defense system for the Army and certain chemical
bombs and munitions. Many of the items already were targeted
for cuts by the Pentagon.
   Other proposed terminations, though, are likely to end up
in bitter floor fights. Proponents of the so-called National
Aerospace Plane, intended to take off from a regular airport,
fly faster than any previous aircraft and go directly into
Earth's orbit, once again are expected to seek Vice President
Quayle's help to retain Pentagon funding for the ambitious
research project. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which is funding part of the work, has argued
that the project will die without hefty Pentagon support.
   Lockheed Corp., the prime contractor for a proposed
multibillion-dollar, jam-resistant satellite communications
network slated for termination by the committee, is gearing
up to try to save that program. Alan Chase, Lockheed's vice
president for business development, said that company
officials were "dismayed, if not shocked" by the panel's vote
to cancel the Milstar program, which has been supported by
both the administration and Congress.
   The company had been counting on Milstar to keep revenue
strong at a time when many of its major aircraft lines are
winding down. Although budget figures for Milstar remain
classified, it was expected to be the major factor in the
growth of Lockheed's surveillance, verification and
communications business. The company had projected revenue in
that segment of its operations to increase to $4.5 billion
annually by the mid-1990s from $3.25 billion last year.
   The panel's bill also includes:
   -- About $3.7 billion, or $1 billion less than the White
House requested, for the Strategic Defense Initiative. Some
lawmakers proposed using language that blasts the
administration's hefty SDI spending plans as "thoroughly
unrealistic," rules out "significant increases" for SDI in
the foreseeable future, and urges the Pentagon "to adjust its
plans appropriately." Sen. John Warner (R., Va.), the ranking
GOP member of the committee, told reporters that the
committee merely "postponed the battle to the floor" of the
Senate.
   -- A nonbinding timetable to slash nearly 500,000 of the
country's 2.1 million active-duty troops over the next five
years, with the Army taking the biggest percentage cut. It is
slated to shrink more than 30% by 1996 under the committee's
scenario. But lawmakers, as expected, rejected Pentagon
proposals for comparable cuts in reserve forces; and they
added nearly $880 million to the White House's request for
equipment earmarked for reserve units.
   -- A 25% cut in the military's intelligence-gathering
budget over five years, starting with a 5% reduction in
fiscal 1992. As part of that effort, Sen. Warner said,
lawmakers will study "whether or not there are many
overlapping and redundant" operations that should be
eliminated.
   -- Reducing funding for the B-2 Stealth bomber to $3.75
billion, or about $400 million less than the Pentagon wanted.
The Air Force still would buy two of the radar-evading planes
in 1991.
   -- Eliminating all funds to deploy nuclear-tipped MX
missiles on specially equipped railroad cars, a decision
expected to be opposed by many GOP lawmakers.
   -- Adding more than $830 million to help clean up
pollution from military facilities and, for the first time,
focus the attention of Pentagon researchers on world
pollution problems.
