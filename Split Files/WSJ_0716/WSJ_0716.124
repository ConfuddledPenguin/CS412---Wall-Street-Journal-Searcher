   Moulinex S.A. of France, an appliance concern, said its
consolidated revenue for the 1990 first half climbed 17% to
2.51 billion francs ($457.2 million) from 2.15 billion francs
a year earlier.
   The company said that the revenue rise was helped by the
launch of a new line of household air conditioners in the
Spanish market and that the increase was only 4% after
adjustment for changes in the company's structure.
