   SEOUL, South Korea -- Samsung Group's recent announcement
that it plans to open an auto assembly plant in Korea next
year has sparked strong opposition from the nation's five
existing auto makers and posed a difficult choice for the
government.
   Samsung Heavy Industries, a unit of Samsung Group, South
Korea's major business conglomerate, has announced plans to
build 1,200 large-sized commercial vehicles in Korea next
year and to boost output to 3,800 units annually by 1995.
Parts would be supplied by Nissan Diesel of Japan.

   The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association, however,
has asked the government to reject Samsung's application for
permission to import technology to make the vehicles.
   The government's power to stop new entries into the auto
business was abolished recently as part of a new industrial
liberalization policy. The government can, however, restrict
imports of technology if they are deemed to be harmful to an
industry or the economy in general.
   KAMA, which represents Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo Motor
Co., Kia Motors Co., Ssangyong Motor Co. and Asia Motors Co.,
said Samsung's entry into the commercial vehicle business
would create a serious oversupply problem that would damage
the domestic auto industry.
   Analysts note, however, that although Korea is well
stocked with auto makers, the four Korean concerns that make
large commercial vehicles are unable to supply more than
about 70% of the 20,000 trucks and 10,000 buses that Koreans
buy each year.
   In Japan, by comparison, four companies meet a domestic
demand of 100,000 vehicles, analysts say.
   Because of the high sensitivity of the issue, the
government is now faced with a very difficult choice, says
Huh Kyung, assistant director at the ministry's
transportation machinery division.
   By opposing Samsung's application, Mr. Huh says, KAMA is
asking the government to reverse its free competition policy.
   "Basically, it is against the ongoing liberalization
policy of the government to reject private projects," Mr. Huh
says. He adds that the government might have to delay the
decision.
   While the ministry considers Samsung's application, the
five auto makers are mounting major lobbying and public
opinion campaigns opposing it.
   In a proposal to the government, KAMA predicted that
Korea's commercial vehicle market, which currently enjoys
growing demand due to an extraordinary construction boom,
will face a sharp decline in demand beginning next year and
will be oversupplied by 1992.
   KAMA also asserted that some of the Nissan technology
Samsung plans to use has already been imported by Ssangyong
Motor Co. Duplicating the technology would be detrimental to
the local economy, the proposal warned.
   Analysts note, however, that behind the auto makers'
strong opposition is their concern about a possible entry by
Samsung into passenger car business.
   Despite Samsung's denials, analysts here believe that
Samsung's commercial vehicle project is a first step toward a
venture in the passenger car business, which has been the
group's major goal for many years.
   In the mid-1980s, Samsung vigorously sought a business
partnership with Chrysler Corp. for the manufacture of
passenger cars. The deal was aborted at the last moment by a
government law prohibiting repeated or excessive investment
in certain areas. Recently, the group unsuccessfully
contacted Honda Motor Co. and other foreign automakers for
technical and other assistance.
