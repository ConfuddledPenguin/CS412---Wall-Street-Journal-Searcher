   SEOUL -- South Korean political squabbling neared 12-month
highs last week, and in reaction, the Korean stock market
neared its 12-month low.
   Fistfights in the National Assembly, strong threats by
minority opposition party assembly members to resign en masse
and the nation's media on a protest strike, while unusual
even for Korea, aren't enough to imperil the nation. But it
was serious enough to worry the already jittery Korean
investor and accelerate the fall of the bear market. The
market fell about 4% this week, ending Saturday at 689.19
points, just slightly above the 1990 low of 688.66 recorded
April 30.

   With the market again breaking the psychological 700
barrier, Korean securities firm analysts are again predicting
that the market will continue to fall to about the 650 level,
where it was right before the 1988 summer Olympics here. At
that point, Korean stocks will be bargains, as measured by a
price-earnings ratio, and the market should begin its long
awaited rebound. Analysts are reluctant to be quoted saying
that because it invokes the ire of Korean investors who
attack brokerage houses whenever the market falls.
   Worries about inflation or the government tightening
credit in order to cure it is worrying investors. But, in
general, the economic news from Korea is good.
   Instead, it is clear that political news is what is
manhandling the market. At the center of the tumult last week
was the ruling party's broadcast "reform" bill, which it
railroaded through the National Assembly Saturday. The bill
creates a third nationwide television network, the first that
isn't government-owned. Advertisers have been agitating for a
third network to provide more advertising time in an
extremely tight market. However, opposition politicians who
strongly opposed the bill say it doesn't give that third
network enough independence from government control.
   The government counters that it must meddle to prevent the
business conglomerates that will jointly own the station from
lowering the standards of programming. But Koreans are
distrustful of the government's motives because the
government still interferes with news reporting despite
general democratic reforms.
   Because the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, a recent
creation of the merger of three conservative parties, has a
73% majority in the National Assembly, the bill was pushed
through despite objections. The ruling party also pushed
through 25 other bills.
   For the past year, the market has seemed immune to
economic news and any attempts by the government to stimulate
the market. In fact, some measures of the government have
been followed by a further decline in the market. A recently
created stock market stabilization fund tried to shore up the
market Friday and Saturday, but it failed as the individual
investors who dominate the Seoul exchange went on a selling
spree.
   Union workers at the Korea Broadcasting System, Munhwa
Broadcasting System and even the Christian Broadcasting
System and the Roman Catholic Radio Pacis decided to go on
strike. The stations are still broadcasting. But the strikes
are worrisome to the government because officials fear that
because the strikes have such a high profile, they may touch
off other strikes in the country. A political strike at the
Korea Broadcasting System last spring was blamed by the
government for provoking a strike at the Hyundai shipyards
that the government suppressed with force.
   The ruling party has said it won't accept the resignations
of the opposition politicians, but opposition party officials
say they will resign to provoke a crisis. They also vow to
take their protests to the street.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   In Tokyo, stocks closed higher, backed by scattered early
morning buying in oil stocks and high-technology shares later
in the afternoon, traders said. The Nikkei index of 225
issues closed at 32644.37 points, up 69.05.
   At mid-morning Monday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had
advanced another 256.65 points to 32901.02.
   Trading on Friday was quiet despite considerable strength
for Japanese bonds from the yen's rally. The currency's
advance stemmed from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan's comments Thursday that the Fed was poised to ease
its policy to offset a possible credit market tightening,
traders said.
   Share prices in London finished a mild session stronger as
an inspiring start to Wall Street and futures-led buying
underpinned an otherwise dull market. The Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index rose 11.7 points to
2382.2.
   Some dealers were clearly surprised that the broad-based
index was able to post any gain, in light of the fact that
the recent slew of corporate downgradings and profit warnings
hasn't yet abated. But traders said the downgradings would
only be significant for sentiment if and when they started to
affect stocks perceived as blue-chip, quality earners and
those known as the "backbone" of British industry.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Madrid; lower in Stockholm
and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks closed
above Thursday's levels.
   Prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Taipei, Wellington and
Singapore, and lower in Sydney, Seoul and Manila.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
