   World technological competition in both manufacturing and
services is increasing rapidly, requiring a high level of
technical sophistication on the part of companies' senior
management. However, we in the U.S. have a competitive
disadvantage in having fewer technologically oriented chief
executives than our principle trading competitors, Japan and
Germany.
   The U.S. selection process for CEOs is different from
those in either Japan or Germany. As a result, American
companies end up with more financially oriented types. This
country's universities turn out proportionately fewer
engineers -- and many more MBAs than either competitor.

   What to do?
   On occasion drastic action is required. As a board member
of a heavy machinery company, I watched a non-technical CEO,
with no competent technical advisers, almost put the company
under with over-cost and under-featured products made with
obsolete manufacturing processes. It took forever (or so it
seemed) for the board to handle the issue because many of the
board members were buddies of the chief executive. Others
were non-technical types who had difficulty understanding the
problem. But after some false starts, we miraculously found
within the company a technically competent engineer, who was
fast becoming an excellent businessman and made him CEO. In
four years he has turned the company around in spectacular
fashion.
   This approach is not commonly taken because identification
of potential CEOs within the technical ranks of a company is
rarely done. It is also of little use to hope that American
culture will suddenly begin to require increased technical
capabilities from CEOs. Nor is it feasible for the
non-technical CEO to go to a few seminars and master the
subject.
   A more practical solution to the technology-management
problem is for the non-technical chief executive to get one
or more trusted advisers (at senior staff or preferably
senior operating levels) who are technically competent --
particularly in application.
   I served in such a role at Ford Motor Co., from the late
1950s into the late '60s. I started as a translator of
technical terms at senior executive meetings. Surrounded by
the then-ubiquitous financial-control types (we called them
"bean counters" or "beanies"), I decided to learn how to
discuss technical issues such as product features, quality or
manufacturing issues in financial terms.
   The beanies had enormous political power at Ford, and so
it was the better part of valor to join them rather than
constantly fight. Of course it didn't hurt that my team put
some useful customer features in our products -- disc brakes
and radial ply tires among them. We also cleaned up some
serious product quality problems: leaking windows, power
steering pumps and transmissions. But these advances might
have been less appreciated had I not learned to express their
importance in language the beanies could understand.
   I was also interested in getting the support of sales and
manufacturing types to get my ideas sold (sometimes against
resistance to change), but this meant learning to translate
my technical message into yet another language. I well
remember being asked in the seemingly endless efforts to get
approval for the original "Mustang" (for which I was project
manager, and Lee Iacocca the sponsor) what the net,
"non-substitutional" increase in vehicle sales volume would
be with the car -- that is, the number of cars that could be
sold without cannibalizing our existing market. Since the
Mustang was a completely new vehicle concept, no one really
knew.
   One of the corporate market research types was given the
question of substitution to answer. He knew from me that the
stand-alone break even volume was about 84,000 units. A week
later he reported that the increased volume, net of
substitution, would be 86,000 units. I called and asked him
how he got the number. He said he liked the car and its
concept. Networking worked]
   We sold well over 400,000 units the first year, and to
this day I really don't know what the net volume was. But
since the gross margin on the Mustang was so high, we made a
ton of money in total.
   The trusted technical advisers should have the following
essential characteristics:
   -- The ability to understand and explain in simple, clear
language the latest technologies;
   -- The ability to translate relevant technology into
company-relevant business objectives;
   -- The ability to network widely into non-technical
company sectors (i.e. sales, manufacturing, finance);
   -- A strong track record of putting new technology
successfully into practice.
   The latter point is crucial. A track record of success in
the marketplace with a new technological innovation is a
must. Too many non-technical CEOs turn to their heads of R&amp;D
for technical advice. If the head of R&amp;D has not had the
experience of working in the marketplace, his or her advice
will not be peppered with the patience and appreciation of
complexities one develops through real marketing experience.
New technology in use involves many more issues than R&amp;D]
   Identification of technical advisers is itself an art.
CEOs looking for such advisers must take the time to pinpoint
those in the company who actually drive new technology into
practice and who can explain the innovation to non-technical
types. If the CEO spots such people among the company's
younger engineers, he should help to get them started up the
ranks.
   Having dealt with a never-ending series of financial types
in my own life, I eventually concluded that they do have the
company's best interests at heart and are well meaning. Their
problem is that financial control and measurement is all they
know. But important measures of customer satisfaction or
market share are not quantifiable before a new product goes
to market; too often the financial types do not realize that
beans must be earned before they are counted.
   That's where the technological advisers should come in.
The technologists can straighten out the bean counters before
they undercut a new product. But the technologists can do so
only if they are either operating at the top levels of
management or are directly advising at that level -- with at
least as much influence as the beanies. That's where the
Japanese and Germans have America beat. Proven technology
advisers can help the U.S. get ahead of its competitors'
power curve.
