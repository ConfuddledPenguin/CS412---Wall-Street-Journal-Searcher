   Federal antitrust regulators asked a U.S. court to block
R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.'s planned $487.5 million
acquisition of a commercial-printing venture owned by
Meredith Corp. and members of West Germany's Burda family.
   The Federal Trade Commission said it "has reason to
believe" the acquisition "could substantially reduce
competition in high-volume publication rotogravure printing"
in the U.S.

   If the agreement is frustrated by the FTC lawsuit, its
collapse would seem unlikely to seriously damage either
Chicago-based Donnelley, the nation's largest commercial
printer, or Meredith, a Des Moines, Iowa, publisher of such
magazines as Ladies' Home Journal and Better Homes and
Gardens. The deal has already been significantly delayed by
an unusually lengthy FTC review.
   But the FTC's move underscores the increased rigor with
which the commission has been scrutinizing proposed mergers
in recent months, compared with the relatively passive stance
it held when dominated by appointees of former President
Reagan. FTC Chairwoman Janet Steiger ordered the more
aggressive review policy when she took office in late 1989.
   Friday's move thus seems likely to be keenly noted by
other companies planning to merge within an industry. ConAgra
Inc., which is seeking to buy another food company, Beatrice
Co., from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., recently disclosed
that completion of its proposed $1.34 billion deal is being
delayed by an FTC request for additional information. A $190
million tender offer for JP Industries Inc. by British
auto-parts maker T&amp;N PLC has similarly been twice extended
because of an FTC review.
   Throughout the FTC review of their plan, both Donnelley
and Meredith had continued to express confidence the deal
would proceed. Both indicated on Friday that they will carry
the fight into the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C.,
where the FTC filed its lawsuit.
   And both sounded miffed: In Des Moines, Meredith President
and Chief Executive Officer Jack D. Rehm issued a statement
saying the company is "extremely disappointed that this
action will further delay closing on a transaction which we
feel is both proper and legal." Donnelley's chairman,
president and chief executive John R. Walter said in a news
release that the company's "case is strong and we believe the
planned acquisition is legally proper."
   The acquisition of the Meredith/Burda venture would be the
largest ever for growth-minded Donnelley, which is considered
among the best-managed and most technologically advanced
companies in the fragmented printing industry.
   The announcement in late December of the pact for the
Meredith/Burda venture was seen by some industry experts as a
signal that Donnelley was ready to undertake a more
aggressive acquisition strategy. Indeed, Mr. Walter said in
Friday's release: "Acquisitions are one important element of
our growth strategy and we are continuing to pursue other
acquisition opportunities both here and abroad."
   If the transaction doesn't proceed, says Rita Spitz, an
analyst with William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago, "it's a lost
opportunity, {for Donnelley} but they'll find other things to
do."
   Ms. Spitz said that if the acquisition doesn't go through,
she would trim her projection of Donnelley's annual rate of
growth to about 10% from 13%, "but that assumes they don't
buy anything else. . . . They would love to buy in Europe,
because they have only 7% of their sales overseas, and most
of their major clients are global companies."
   Meredith's broadcast operations, and to a lesser extent
its magazines, have recently felt the impact of a nationwide
dip in advertising. Part of the reason for the company's
agreement to sell its 50% stake in the Meredith/Burda venture
was the heavy capital outlays the printing operation
requires. Meredith indicated in December that it would weigh
a share repurchase plan with proceeds from the planned sale,
as well as looking at possible acquisitions and "continuing
to launch new properties" in its magazine line.
   J. Kendrick Noble, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said a
possible collapse of the deal wouldn't have much impact on
Meredith. "They're in pretty good financial shape," he said,
adding that the company hasn't committed itself to any
significant expenditures of the expected funds.
