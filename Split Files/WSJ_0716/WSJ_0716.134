   Lincoln N.C. Realty Fund Inc. said in Palo Alto, Calif.,
that it resumed negotiations with Silverstone Partners over a
possible tender offer by Silverstone to acquire Lincoln.
   The announcement is the latest in an on-again, off-again
series of negotiations between the companies. Lincoln
rejected an offer by Silverstone, a closely held Los Angeles
partnership, in April. Lincoln in February signed a letter of
intent to be acquired by Silverstone but Lincoln terminated
the letter in March because Lincoln's banker couldn't confirm
the financial fairness of the transaction.

   Lincoln, a real estate investment trust, said the
companies would negotiate the exact terms of a tender offer,
in which Silverstone would purchase as much as all of
Lincoln's common shares and warrants outstanding.
