   CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc., a futures brokerage company
whose chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, also is chairman of
the Chicago Board of Trade, apparently is having financial
difficulties.
   The firm hasn't been able to maintain the minimum amount
of capital required by the Board of Trade to support its
current level of customer business, exchange members said.

   They said rumors about the firm's financial health were
widespread at the exchange, but the exact problem wasn't
known. One futures trader who clears, or processes, his
trades through Stotler said the company was returning an
unknown amount of funds to certain customers Friday in order
to reduce the capital "cushion" Stotler is required to
maintain. Other futures industry officials said they believed
Stotler was seeking a capital infusion late last week.
   Neither Mr. Mahlmann nor Thomas Egan, Stotler's chief
executive officer, returned repeated telephone calls to the
firm Thursday and Friday.
   If a quick fix can't be found to boost Stotler's capital,
the exchange or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has
the power to force a futures brokerage firm to bow out of the
customer business, or accept orders for liquidation of
positions only.
   Stotler, which remained in operation as of late Friday, is
a pillar of the grain-trading establishment at the Board of
Trade, tracing its roots to an Illinois grain firm founded in
1919. The firm has about 300 branches and affiliates lining
Main Streets of small towns throughout the Midwest.
   But like most local futures trading firms, it is minute
compared with the multi-billion dollar behemoths of Wall
Street, which increasingly dominate the fast-growing
financial futures segment of the industry. Stotler had
shareholders' equity of $8.5 million as of March 31,
according to its latest financial statements. During the
1980s several old-line futures firms folded or merged with
other firms in response to competitive pressures.
   The company's capital deficiency appeared to be the result
of Stotler and its subsidiaries not providing adequate
reserves against a rising amount of funds in customer
accounts, according to the head of another Board of Trade
firm, who asked to remain anonymous. He said the firm is
rumored to be in a dispute with regulators, at the Board of
Trade, the CFTC, or both, over the classification of assets
Stotler was using to support its customers business.
   Commodity regulations require that futures brokerage firms
maintain cash or liquid assets, such as government
securities, in a separate account equal to at least 4% of
so-called segregated customer funds. The required set aside
can be higher depending on a firm's configuration.
   Restrictions are put on a firm's activities when its
capital falls below the equivalent of 7% of customer funds.
The dispute may be over the relative liquidity of the assets
Stotler is counting as capital, exchange members said.
   Stotler's capital levels don't appear to have been
suddenly reduced by any significant trading losses in the
futures markets, exchange members said.
   Mr. Mahlmann, while not active in the day to day
management of Stotler, owns about 10% of the company's stock,
according to a prospectus prepared at the time of the
company's initial public stock offering in 1988.
   Despite focusing most of his attention on exchange duties
in recent years, Mr. Mahlmann has been at Stotler "night and
day" for the past few days, a Board of Trade employee said
Friday.
   The Board of Trade doesn't publicly disclose when member
firms, most of which are closely held, fall below net capital
requirements.
   Stotler Group's stock didn't open for trading Thursday on
the American Stock Exchange; on Thursday morning, the Amex
said there was "news pending" about the company. The stock
last traded at $7.875 a share; trading in the stock remained
halted Friday.
   Stotler Group went public in August 1988 at $11 a share in
a stock and debt offering that raised more than $20 million
in capital for the firm, according to the prospectus.
