   Micron Products Inc., New York, said unsecured creditors
of its troubled Numedco Inc. subsidiary have moved to force
Numedco into bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Micron said the creditors filed a complaint in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Philadelphia. Rather than undergo
involuntary proceedings, Numedco will ask for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, Micron said.
Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate, with
protection from creditor lawsuits, while working out a plan
to settle debts.

   Kuno Laren, chairman of Micron, said Numedco, which has
been unprofitable for seven quarters, has been attempting to
sell assets to satisfy secured debt. Mr. Laren estimated that
the unsecured creditors, unpaid since June 6, are owed $3
million.
   Micron is a maker of medical products; Numedco, which is
curtailing operations, has been a distributor of medical and
surgical supplies. According to Mr. Laren, the parent company
hasn't guaranteed any of Numedco's unsecured debts.
   Micron said its manufacturing business remains profitable
"and will continue."
