   The Roy, Utah, company attributed the net income rise to
increased gross margins stemming from better manufacturing
performance and product-cost reductions. Iomega said its
gross margins were 48% in the quarter, compared with 41% in
the year-ago period. The company said its improved margins
allowed it to invest more in sales and marketing and in
research and development in the period.
