   Ciba-Geigy AG, Switzerland's largest chemical and
pharmaceutical concern, said 1990 first-half sales fell 2.3%
to 10.89 billion Swiss francs ($7.83 billion) from 11.15
billion francs a year earlier.
   But in local-currency terms, sales rose 4%. The difference
in the percentage changes owes to the Swiss franc's
appreciation the dollar, yen and pound.

   Typical of most Swiss companies, Ciba-Geigy didn't
disclose first-half profit or provide an outlook for
second-half sales. But it said it will disclose first-half
earnings in an interim report to shareholders in mid-August.
   Despite the overall first-half sales decline, sales in the
pharmaceuticals division, which accounts for the largest
share of the total, rose 3% to 3.13 billion francs. The
agricultural division's sales slipped 3% to 2.79 billion
francs. In local-currency terms, pharmaceuticals sales were
up 11% and agricultural sales were up 3%.
   Ciba-Geigy in 1989 earned 1.56 billion francs, up 18% from
1.33 billion francs in 1988.
