   TENS OF THOUSANDS MARCHED in Moscow to demand greater
democracy.
   The protesters walked to the Kremlin's walls just two days
after the conclusion of a Communist Party congress at which
Gorbachev consolidated his control of the party's center but
lost some of the party's best-known progressive members, who
quit. The Soviet president issued a decree yesterday that
would grant all groups access to television and radio but
still maintain Moscow's control over the airwaves in all
republics. Gorbachev met with visiting West German Chancellor
Kohl concerning a unified Germany's military status, and both
said they were near an accord.

such as "bullying."

20% of their company's shares on special terms.
