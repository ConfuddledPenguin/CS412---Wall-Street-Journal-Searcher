   First New York Business Bank Corp., New York, said
second-quarter earnings plummeted after additions to its
loan-loss reserves in a soft New York metropolitan area real
estate market.
   The holding company for First New York Bank for Business
said net income was $61,000, or two cents a share, against $1
million, or 27 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. It
said it added $3.9 million to reserves. The quarter's results
also reflect a one-time gain of $2 million on the sale of a
leasehold.

   For the six months, First New York reported net income of
$794,000, or 21 cents a share, against $1.9 million, or 51
cents a share, the year before.
   Martin A. Simon, chairman, said that "in light of current
economic conditions, especially in the real estate area, the
company's priorities for the first six months were to
strengthen our capital ratio while maintaining high loan loss
reserves." The loss reserve now stands at 1.36% of loans, and
total capital is 8.34% of assets, the company said. Total
assets at June 30 stood at $712.2 million.
   First New York stock closed Friday at $5, up 37.5 cents,
in national over-the-counter trading.
