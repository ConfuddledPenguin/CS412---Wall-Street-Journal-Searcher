   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. said it is beginning a $6.9
billion refinancing today that will retire many of its most
troublesome junk bonds by open-market purchases and an
exchange offer.
   The vast refinancing package is designed to shore up the
tobacco and food company's balance sheet and ward off a
potential financial crisis. As much as $4.45 billion of
high-yield junk bonds will be retired under the plan, along
with more than $2 billion of other costly forms of debt.
These borrowings will be replaced by a mixture of lower-cost
bank debt, preferred stock and new equity.

   RJR's launch of the plan comes after six months of intense
negotiations by the company and its controlling shareholder,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. Securities analysts and
executives who have worked on the refinancing say they
believe it will relieve debt pressure on the company and
allow RJR's equity holders to achieve healthy profits.
   Final details of the plan were hammered out in a series of
weekend meetings. As negotiations were wrapped up last night,
RJR was forced to make several modest concessions in the plan
to satisfy bondholder interests. The dividend rate on a new
preferred stock being issued by RJR, for example, was raised
to 11 1/2%. RJR had originally told its commercial bankers
that the new preferred stock was likely to carry a 10%
dividend.
   RJR also was forced to accept slightly higher interest
rates than it wanted on junk bonds that will remain
outstanding after the repurchase. One issue, the 14.07% reset
bonds of 2007, will carry a new interest rate of 17%.
Another, the 14.07% reset bonds of 2009, will carry a new
rate of 17 3/8%. Those rates were set by a neutral investment
bank, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., after
RJR's advisers and bondholders' representatives disagreed on
the appropriate rate.
   Still, RJR and KKR officials voiced jubilation at the
overall terms. "We are pleased," said Henry Kravis, a KKR
partner. Louis Gerstner, RJR's chief executive officer,
called the refinancing package "a comprehensive, creative
program."
   The refinancing plan's chief objective is to purge away
most of the reset bonds of 2007 and 2009. These bonds have
proved an immense headache to RJR since they were issued as
part of KKR's record $26 billion buy-out of RJR in February
1989. That's because the bonds' interest rate must be reset
so that they trade at full face value. The bonds had sunk to
a deep discount earlier this year, raising the prospect that
RJR might have to accept a painfully high reset rate of 20%
or more to meet its reset obligations.
   Starting today, though, RJR will have billions of dollars
at its disposal to sweep away the reset bonds. RJR last night
confirmed widely circulating reports that it has raised $2.25
billion in new bank debt, $1.7 billion in equity from KKR and
$1.15 billion from existing bank credit lines to help buy
back the reset bonds and other high-cost debt. RJR also said
it will issue $1.8 billion in new convertible bonds.
   In practical terms, RJR said the refinancing can begin
today with open-market purchases of the reset bonds of 2007.
Some $1.7 billion of cash is earmarked for such purchases,
either in the open market or "by other means," presumably a
tender offer. RJR said it could add $350 million to the
repurchase kitty if it wants to.
   The next stage of the refinancing, RJR said, will be an
exchange offer for as much as 85% of the reset bonds of 2009.
RJR will offer holders $800 million in cash and $1.6 billion
face value of a new convertible preferred stock yielding
11.5%.
   The preferred will be convertible into RJR common at $9 a
share. That's 44% above the $6.25 a share that KKR and its
partnerships are paying for their additional $1.7 billion
equity investment in RJR. It's a more modest 22% above
Friday's New York Stock Exchange closing price of $7.375 for
RJR warrants, which are practically equivalent to RJR common.
(There isn't any public market yet in RJR common.)
   RJR said it expects to file the exchange offer with the
Securities and Exchange Commission shortly and expects to
begin the offer in September. Assuming there aren't delays,
the offer is likely to be open about a month.
   To complete its refinancing, RJR plans to spend $1 billion
to retire increasing-rate notes that currently carry a 15%
interest rate. It also will spend $1.15 billion to pay off a
bridge loan made by its banks. Finally, $200 million of
preferred stock will be issued to a KKR partnership in
exchange for retiring $200 million of an about $600 million
bridge loan that KKR has outstanding to RJR.
   Once the recapitalization is completed, RJR's Mr. Gerstner
said, the company's debt-to-equity ratio should improve to
5:1, from 23:1 on March 31. "There's a real sense of
accomplishment and excitement," he said last night. "This
adds substantial equity to the company."
   RJR said its total debt will decline to slightly less than
$20 billion.
   Mr. Gerstner declined to speculate how RJR's junk bonds
might react to the formal launch of the refinancing program.
But in recent weeks, RJR's bonds have soared as details of
the plan gradually emerged. The reset bonds of 2007 were
quoted Friday at $871.25 for each $1,000 face amount, while
the reset bonds of 2009 were quoted at $1,061.25 for each
$1,200 face amount. Those bonds are by far the most widely
held junk bonds around, with tens of thousands of holders.
