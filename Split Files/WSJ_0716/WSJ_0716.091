   Accor S.A., which agreed late last week to acquire Motel 6
L.P., has seen the future of the hotel business and it's a
no-frills overnight package.
   In a news conference and interviews on both sides of the
Atlantic, executives of the French company and the U.S. chain
of economy motels said the alliance will make Accor a global
force in budget lodging, which they termed the fastest
growing and most profitable segment of the industry.

   The Motel 6 purchase almost doubles the number of rooms
owned by Accor, prompting Gerard Pelisson and his longtime
co-chairman Paul Dubrule, to proclaim Accor the world's
biggest hotel group with 132,000 rooms, well ahead of
Marriott Corp.'s 109,600. Mr. Pelisson dismissed Holiday
Inns, with its 350,000-room inventory, as "nothing more than
a booking service now," because of its large number of
franchised rooms. Best Western apparently would fit in that
same category.
   While analysts said they generally approve of Accor's
strategy, some worry that the expensive Motel 6 purchase
could be a risky jump. Accor's past U.S. experience has been
disappointing and the U.S. lodging industry is beset by a
glut of rooms and shrinking margins.
   But the French seem unable to resist the huge U.S. market.
This purchase is the latest in a string of expensive French
investments in U.S. industries, including Groupe Michelin's
recent purchase of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. and
Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s acquisition of Rorer Group Inc.
   Accor agreed last week to acquire the budget hotel chain
for $22.50 per limited partnership unit, valuing the company
at $1.3 billion. The French company negotiated the
transaction with Motel 6's controlling shareholder, Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co.; Accor will also assume about $1 billion
in debt.
   For its money, Accor will get a chain of bargain-basement
roadside motels currently spread across 42 states in the U.S.
Motel 6's down-market ambitions match Accor's cut-price
Formule 1 hotels, started in Europe three years ago.
   Both chains cut the costly extras that more traditional
hotels offer, such as bellhops or bouquets, and for the most
part stick to the basics: an automated reservation service
and a bed in a room. While Formule 1 hotels don't even
provide bathrooms for each room, tucking them down the hall
instead, Motel 6 has actually been on something of an
amenities binge of late -- adding color televisions and
telephones to many otherwise -- spartan rooms.
   Both companies are convinced that the best opportunities
in the industry are in the segment occupied by Motel 6 and
Formule 1. "The market is huge," said Georges Lemener,
director of the office of the chairman for Accor, who was in
New York. "And the competition is mostly mom-and-pop
operations." In the midscale and luxury-price markets, he
added, intense competition and increasing costs are squeezing
profit margins.
   Accor is already building Formule 1 hotels in Europe at
the rate of about one a week and, according to Accor's
financial director Michel Baillon, will aim to add about 75 a
year to Motel 6's existing 554 hotels. Accord also plans to
introduce the Motel 6 format in Canada and Mexico. Accor aims
to reach a world-wide total of about 2,000 Motel 6 and
Formule 1 hotels by 1997.
   Accor's expansion plans represent a sharp increase from
the 30 to 40 new hotels Motel 6 has averaged in recent years.
The rapid expansion will more than double the company's
budget for new construction to about $225 million a year,
said Joseph W. McCarthy, president and chief executive
officer of Motel 6. But Mr. Lemener insists that the
expansion, which will be accomplished largely through new
borrowing, won't be burdensome for Accor, which has a strong
balance sheet. "Don't forget, in the low end of the market,
we are cash-positive immediately," he said.
   Accor is in relatively good financial shape after a 3.6
billion franc issue ($655 million) of shares with warrants at
the beginning of the year, analysts said. In addition, Accor
will carry only part of the load of the $1.3 billion
purchase. It plans to set up a new holding company to own
Motel 6, in which it expects to have only an initial 40%
stake alongside several large French banks. This holding
company, with an initial capitalization of two to three
billion francs, will fund the Motel 6 purchase by issuing
convertible bonds, which will be taken up by its partners.
   The expansion also makes economic sense, Mr. McCarthy
believes, because it will increase Motel 6's recognition
among potential customers and lead to increases in occupancy
rates. "There's almost a billboard benefit every time you add
a property to a community you haven't previously been
represented in," he said.
   Analysts generally remain bullish on the high-earning
French group, but the company's ambitious growth strategy
also worries some of them. "I don't like it. The business is
more and more competitive and some of the bigger names are
already moving down-market," said Lorna Statham, French share
analyst with Citicorp Investment Bank in London.
   She also pointed out that Accor's new exposure to the U.S.
market could make it yet another victim of the dollar
exchange rate, like other French groups dependent on sales in
dollars.
   Analysts also worry that the acquisition could tip Accor's
activity away from high-margin businesses like catering, and
too much toward low-margin hotels. Before the Motel 6
acquisition, hotels represented 45% to 50% of Accor's sales
and profits.
   Ron Littleboy of Nomura Research Institute said he was
surprised by Accor's move because, like many analysts, he had
expected Accor to concentrate on acquiring the Pullman hotel
chain, controlled by Franco-Belgian holding Cie.
Internationale des Wagons-Lits &amp; du Tourisme. Last month
Accor took a small stake in Wagons-Lits through a joint
holding company with Belgium's Societe Generale de Belgique.
   Mr. Littleboy said that, although still positive on Accor,
he was worried that oversupply in the U.S. could squeeze
hoteliers' margins there further. He said revenue in the U.S.
budget hotel sector was growing at a slim annual 2% to 3% and
was unlikely to pick up significantly. "Prices are under
pressure," he said, but added, "Accor is good at running
hotels. This could be a timely acquisition."
   Michael Mueller of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco,
thinks the deal will prove a winner. "The unit economics are
very attractive," he said. "Gross margins in these hotels are
45% to 50%." And while the overall U.S. lodging market is
glutted, the economy segment is undersupplied, he said. "The
midpriced hotels have priced themselves out of the market,"
he said, citing the typical cost of a Holiday Inns room --
about $65 to $70 a night-compared with Motel 6's average room
cost of $26.60. "There is a very large segment of the
population that doesn't have many alternatives" for
reasonable lodging, he said.
   At their Paris news conference Friday, Messrs. Pelisson
and Dubrule sketched the profile of the budget hotel guest as
young, sports-minded students, or cost-conscious pensioners
who still enjoyed traveling. "People are living longer and
longer. It's a considerable market in the developed world,"
Mr. Pelisson said.
   Nevertheless, the U.S. market hasn't been kind to Accor in
the past. Its more-upscale Sofitel and Novotel chains have
failed to make headway there and last year Accor sold its two
midrange Ibis hotels in Georgia, leaving it with only a
handful of U.S. hotels.
   In 1989 it posted a 15.5 million franc loss in the U.S. on
overall group operating profit of 1.19 billion francs. Group
sales in 1989 were 19.9 billion francs, of which the U.S.
accounted for 4%.
   Mr. Pelisson and Mr. Dubrule, who have run Accor as an
even-handed double act for the past 23 years, attribute their
hitherto disappointing U.S. performance to a market
"polluted" by property speculators taking advantage of tax
breaks to build new hotels at every opportunity.
   This has helped cause a radical shakeup among American
hoteliers. In little over a year, several of the U.S.'s
best-known chains have been sold, including Hilton,
Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, Ramada Inns and now Motel 6.
And the bidders for these properties, for the most part, have
come from outside the U.S.
   Analysts are concerned that, given the state of the hotel
market and Motel 6's heavy debt load, Accor is paying a high
price for the U.S. group.
   But Mr. Pelisson said that Motel 6 was fairly priced at
only 10.5 times gross operating profit (net income before
taxes, interest and depreciation), well below Bass PLC's
purchase of Holiday Inn, which was 13.2 times gross operating
profit or Seibu Season's Intercontinental acquisition, at 17
times.
   "It is the lowest multiple of all hotel acquisitions in
the past five years and we have growth potential in the next
five years we didn't feel they had in those other
acquisitions," Mr. Lemener said. "We're not saying it is a
cheap price, but we feel we got value for our money."
