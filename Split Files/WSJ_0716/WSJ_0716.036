   WASHINGTON -- The Army, as part of a budget-cutting drive,
said it will phase out reserve officer training programs at
50 colleges and universities across the U.S.
   The announcement is a symbolic turning point for the Army
as it struggles to bring personnel and spending plans in line
with post-Cold War budget realities. While the schools
involved have produced relatively few officers in the past
few years, the service's civilian and uniformed leaders
nevertheless debated for months whether to cut politically
popular officer-training programs. Such programs give the
military high visibility on campuses while providing large
amounts of scholarship aid to students.

   The move means that nearly one out of every eight Army
Reserve Officers' Training Corps units nationwide will be
disbanded by the fall of 1991. The affected schools are in 27
states and range from Dartmouth College and other large
institutions to such small schools as Bemidji State
University in rural Minnesota.
   Army ROTC programs also will be consolidated at dozens of
other campuses, but officials said details of those shifts
haven't been worked out. So far, Air Force and Navy brass
have avoided closing officer-training units because they face
proportionately smaller long-term cuts in the number of
officers and enlisted troops.
   Over the next five years, the Army will need at least
20,000 fewer officers than envisioned under earlier budget
scenarios. Well over half of the reduction will be realized
by cutting the projected number of newly commissioned ROTC
officers.
   Kim Wincup, the Army's top personnel official, said in a
recent interview the Army is determined to reduce by 20% the
number of new officers produced by ROTC programs. Currently,
ROTC programs turn out about 7,400 second lieutenants a year.
   But before the announcement, Maj. Gen. Wallace Arnold, who
runs the Army's ROTC programs, said that "every student with
an {ROTC} scholarship will be allowed to get a commission."
To achieve the cutbacks, the Army intends to recruit fewer
new cadets, reduce the number of nonscholarship students
taking ROTC courses, and increase competition among graduates
seeking active-duty assignments.
   If Congress demands deeper personnel cuts than the Army
currently plans, ROTC is certain to go through another
shake-up, and thousands of additional would-be officers will
be encouraged -- or forced -- to leave the program.
