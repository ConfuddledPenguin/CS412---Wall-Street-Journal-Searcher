   SEOUL, South Korea -- Automobile exports more than doubled
in June, but were still below last year's levels, the Trade
and Industry Ministry reported.
   South Korean auto makers sold 27,240 cars overseas in
June, compared with 12,365 cars in May. The June total was
down 2.2% from a year ago, the ministry said.

   June sales growth, although helped by Hyundai's
introduction of a new subcompact, Scoupe, was based on
recovering demand in the U.S. market, officials said.
