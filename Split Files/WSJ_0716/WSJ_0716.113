   MINNEAPOLIS -- MEI Diversified Inc., which is redefining
its name, is seeking to enter the employee leasing and beauty
salon businesses but is backing away from a medical products
acquisition, its president said.
   "We're a company in transition," Donald E. Benson said,
disclosing that MEI no longer is committed to acquiring
LecTec Corp., which makes medical tape, sensors and other
devices. "We've come to the conclusion that in relation to
other transactions pending that we should not give up those
three million shares" LecTec would cost. Still, he said MEI
may take a minority position in LecTec.

   MEI hopes to close by mid-August on the acquisition of a
chain of department-store beauty salons, which would
represent about $400 million in annual revenue. It is looking
also into the employee leasing business, by which MEI would
buy employees from small companies and then lease them back.
Mr. Benson indicated that MEI is pursuing an unidentified
entity that would become the nucleus of that business.
   He said such rebuilding efforts are likely to result in a
slightly larger loss for the year than in 1989, when MEI lost
$5.5 million, or 29 cents a share, on sales of $205.4
million. While he wouldn't quantify the anticipated loss --
it depends partly on a pending audit following the recent
sale of its snack and candy businesses -- Mr. Benson said he
expects the second half to be flat to slightly profitable.
   MEI reported a first-quarter loss of $4.5 million, or 24
cents a share, on sales of $44.7 million. In the second
quarter MEI sold its candy and snack units to Ezaki Glico Co.
of Osaka, Japan, for $58 million. Mr. Benson said those units
were becoming slim-margin commodity businesses.
   It is understood that MEI has hired Salomon Brothers to
seek buyers for its nut business, which represented about
one-third of first-quarter revenue.
   MEI expects to retain a healthy balance sheet, with
perhaps $75 million in cash and equivalents after the pending
salon acquisition, Mr. Benson said.
   He said that while the acquisition will cost $50 million,
about $25 million in Essanelle Salon Co. debt would be
immediately refinanced, reducing MEI's cash outflow to $25
million. The acquisition also includes Glemby Co. and Maxims.
Terms call for Regis Corp., which owns Essanelle and Maxims,
to retain a 20% interest.
   Because nearly 2,000 beauty salons, in such department
store chains as Sears, Bloomingdales, May Co. and Saks Fifth
Avenue, would be acquired, MEI is seeking approval for the
acquisition under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law. Still,
the acquisition represents only about 4% of the total salon
market, Mr. Benson said.
   MEI would become essentially a holding company should the
pending transactions occur, Mr. Benson said. He added that
MEI has no plans to retire debt or redeem its shares in the
foreseeable future.
   The LecTec situation has changed because MEI believes it
could achieve better leverage elsewhere, Mr. Benson said.
Still, MEI could end up with a position in the
medical-products field, because it lent LecTec $45 million to
acquire New Dimensions in Medicine, a unit of Baxter
Healthcare Corp. That loan was secured with New Dimensions
stock.
   Mr. Benson said LecTec is expecting an investment banker
to advise its management soon on its various options. Should
MEI take a position in LecTec, Mr. Benson said it probably
would be in the range of 700,000 to one million of LecTec's
3.2 million shares outstanding.
