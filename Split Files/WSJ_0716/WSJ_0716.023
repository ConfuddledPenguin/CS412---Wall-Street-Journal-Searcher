   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America said its directors
voted to accept all provisions of Pennsylvania's new
anti-takeover law. The legislation, signed into law April 27,
allows publicly owned concerns to exclude themselves from all
or part of its anti-takeover provisions within 90 days of
passage.

   Alcoa also said its directors acted to redeem all rights
outstanding under the company's 1986 shareholder rights plan.
These rights currently trade with Alcoa common stock. A
redemption price of five cents per right will be paid Aug. 25
to shares of record Aug. 3.
