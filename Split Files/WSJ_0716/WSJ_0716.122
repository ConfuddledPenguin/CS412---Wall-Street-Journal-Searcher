   In the first round of legal-fee requests in the Drexel
Burnham Lambert Group Inc. bankruptcy case, lawyers have
asked the court to approve payments of $6.3 million for their
first 14 weeks of work.
   A hearing on the fee applications -- from attorneys for
Drexel, its creditors and its shareholders -- is set for Aug.
15 before U.S. Judge Howard Buschman III in federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. Drexel filed for
bankruptcy-law protection Feb. 13.

   The documents reflect the combative relationship between
Drexel and its creditors' committee. Drexel's attorneys take
credit for rapidly moving to maximize the firm's assets. The
creditors' lawyers say they have investigated possible
wrongdoing by management -- mostly related to $250 million in
bonuses paid shortly before Drexel folded. Drexel has said
the bonuses were proper.
   In its application, Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, the
Cleveland-based law firm for the creditors' committee,
described itself as the "watchdog of this estate." Jones Day,
which has been working on the case since Feb. 28, billed $2.6
million, including $456,521 in expenses. The firm rang up
11,916 hours, at an average of $157 an hour. Working on the
case were 16 partners, 36 associates and 28 other
professionals.
   Drexel's law firm, Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges of New York
presented a bill for $2.8 million, including $408,282 in
out-of-pocket expenses. The law firm has already received a
retainer of $1 million from Drexel. Led by partner Alan
Miller, Weil Gotshal's attorneys and professionals logged
12,742 hours, at an average billing rate of $192 an hour,
according to the filing. The firm said 26 partners, 49
associates and 61 other professionals worked on the case.
   Milgrim Thomajan &amp; Lee, the New York law firm for the
Drexel shareholders' committee, is seeking $711,119,
including $68,122 in expenses, for the work it has done since
it was retained on April 12. The 3,708 hours the law firm put
in on the case were billed at an average of $173 an hour.
Working on the case were 12 partners, 22 associates and 14
other professionals.
   Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, special counsel for Drexel,
presented a bill for $158,289, including $31,797 in expenses.
The New York law firm said it is mainly advising the company
on matters relating to investigations by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, federal grand juries and congressional
subcommittees. Cahill Gordon said 17 partners, eight
associates and 11 other professionals worked on the case at
an average rate of $203 an hour.

   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PRESS CONFERENCES on thrift-fraud
indictments come under fire.
   Defense attorneys are decrying the media events, saying
the extraordinary publicity will endanger their clients'
rights to fair trials by prejudicing future jurors.
   Last week the Justice Department held simultaneous press
conferences in Dallas and Washington, D.C., to announce the
indictment of Edwin T. McBirney III, former owner of the
defunct Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas. Mr. McBirney's
defense lawyer, Paul Coggins, called the press conferences
"unconscionable."
   "A trial of an S&amp;L executive in this climate is as hard as
a trial of a black revolutionary in the 1960s," Mr. Coggins
said.
   U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of Dallas argues that public
interest in thrift fraud justifies the press conferences,
especially for a case involving a thrift failure as large as
Sunbelt's. The Dallas thrift left a $2 billion hole when it
failed in 1987. "A case of this magnitude deserves national
attention," he said.
   The Justice Department did bow to fair-trial concerns last
month when it canceled press conferences on the indictment of
Don R. Dixon, former owner of defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan
Association.
   The indictment in Dallas came in the midst of the criminal
trial of Mr. Dixon's former accountant, Wellington O.
Rothwell, and the accountant's real estate partner, Rosswell
H. Westmoreland. Mr. Dixon had been mentioned frequently in
the trial, and defense attorneys threatened to seek a
mistrial if the Justice Department used the Dixon press
conferences to rail against thrift fraud.
   Justice Department attorneys, after meeting with the trial
judge, agreed to cancel the press conferences. Messrs.
Rothwell and Westmoreland were convicted less than two weeks
later, and some jurors admitted that they had learned of Mr.
Dixon's indictment through the media and had discussed it
during their deliberations.
   Defense attorneys for Messrs. Rothwell and Westmoreland
have filed a request for a new trial, charging that the
timing of Mr. Dixon's indictment unfairly prejudiced the
jury.
   Mr. Collins, the Dallas U.S. Attorney, said the indictment
"was purely coincidental" and was timed to avoid triggering
the statute of limitations. The press conference was
canceled, he said, "in order to help ensure that we were not
putting that case at risk."
   The Justice Department did manage to stage a media event,
however. Prosecutors allowed Mr. Dixon to remain free without
posting bond, but in return asked that he eschew the usual
low-key surrender to authorities at the Dallas federal
courthouse, where cameras are banned.
   Instead, Mr. Dixon surrendered at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation headquarters in Dallas so that news media
cameras could capture him in handcuffs.

   FILIPINO SEAMEN may receive $40 million in wage case,
judge says.
   A federal judge in Tacoma, Wash., said he is likely to
award more than $40 million to 21 seamen who allege that a
Japanese shipping company defrauded them by not paying their
full wages, according to lawyers on both sides of the case.
   Judge Jack Tanner proposed the award at a hearing Friday
but has not yet issued a formal ruling. The award would be
among the largest ever granted in a U.S. maritime wage case,
according to lawyers familiar with the case. The plaintiffs'
demands in the case -- which included about $27 million in
punitive damages -- is close to what the judge has suggested
he will award.
   The plaintiffs worked on a ship that hauled lumber between
Japan and the U.S. They allege they were forced to sign two
sets of payroll receipts. One set showed wages that complied
with international standards; the other showed the seafarers'
actual wages, which were allegedly about one-fifth of the
amount on the false wage statements.
   Lawyers for the ship's owner, Delica Shipping S.A., admit
to the double bookkeeping but argue that the seamen willingly
participated in the sham. "These folks knew exactly what they
were getting into," said Joseph Stacey, a Seattle lawyer who
represented Delica. "They got 100% of what they were
expecting to receive."
   The case is also unusual because all the parties in the
suit are foreign. According to court documents, the ship was
registered in the Republic of Vanuatu by Delica, a Panamanian
corporation owned by the Japanese shareholders of Inui
Steamship Co. A federal law makes U.S. wage regulations
applicable to "foreign seamen while on vessels in the harbors
of the United States of America."
   But some maritime-law experts say the law shouldn't be
interpreted to allow foreign seamen to bring wage disputes in
a U.S. court simply because their ship docks here
temporarily. Paul Daigle, chairman of the U.S. Maritime Law
Association's Committee of Maritime Personnel, said U.S.
judges shouldn't be "the arbiter of what's right and decent
and moral in the Far East."
   But Scott Stickney, a Seattle lawyer for some of the
Filipino seamen, disagrees. If foreign shippers don't pay
their seamen at internationally accepted rates, they can cut
costs sufficiently to "undermine American maritime trade," he
said.

   MISSOURI OFFICIALS FEAR court decision will restrict
municipal agencies.
   Ruling in a job-bias case, the Missouri Supreme Court
ruled that local human-rights commissions in Missouri aren't
authorized to hold hearings and impose remedies. But some
officials are concerned that broad language in the opinion
could be interpreted to similarly limit the authority of
other city agencies.
   "We've got hundreds of local agencies that decide all
sorts of ordinance violations," says Howard Wright, city
attorney in Springfield, Mo., which has petitioned the court
to clarify its holding. "The implications of that kind of
decision would be extremely far-reaching."
   The case involved Betty L. Shortt, who was fired from her
job in the Springfield office of Yellow Freight Systems Inc.,
an Overland Park, Kan., motor carrier. Contending she was
discriminated against because of a disability, Ms. Shortt
appealed to the local human-rights commission, which ordered
the company to reinstate her with back pay. A lower court
ruled the commission exceeded its authority and recently the
Missouri Supreme Court agreed, saying it could find "nothing"
in the state's constitution or statutes authorizing
municipalities to enforce such remedies.
   Springfield contends the ruling will encourage "needless
litigation" to test the authority of municipal agencies. But
Ronald Sandhaus, an attorney for Yellow Freight, said, "I
don't think their fears are well-founded."
   The Missouri Legislature may be asked to step into the
debate, some officials say.

   NEW JERSEY ATTORNEY LIABLE for frivolous suit, judge
rules.
   In a first for the state, an attorney who filed a motion
-- and not just a client -- was ordered to pay the
opposition's fees when an argument was ruled to be frivolous.
   An attorney for Sheldon Karabell, a Pennsylvania doctor,
claimed that Caesars Hotel Casino in Atlantic City took
advantage of his client's compulsive gambling habits.
   Dr. Karabell said the casino, a unit of Caesars World
Inc., knew of his compulsion but lured him to the gambling
tables with free drinks, lodging and helicopter rides from
his home. The casino then encouraged him to gamble on credit
in his "diminished capacity," Dr. Karabell alleged. He and
his lawyers, the Philadelphia law firm of Dolchin, Slotkin &amp;
Todd, made the claims after Caesars sued in New Jersey state
court to recover its $540,000 in winnings.
   But in fact-finding interviews with his attorneys present,
Dr. Karabell conceded that only his wife and doctor knew of
his gambling compulsion, that complimentary travel and
lodging had no effect on him and that he never got drunk when
he gambled, said Atlantic City attorney Lloyd Levenson, who
represents Caesars.
   Superior Court Judge John Himmelberger dismissed Dr.
Karabell's claims as frivolous in May. Last week he ordered
Dr. Karabell, his lawyer Joel Todd and Mr. Todd's law firm to
pay $24,203 in costs and fees. New Jersey's 1988 law
permitting such sanctions does not specify who should pay
them.
   Mr. Todd said he is considering an appeal and that his
case was filed in good faith under existing federal case law.
