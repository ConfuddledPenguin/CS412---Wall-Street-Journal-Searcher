   NEW YORK -- In the battle to pull in new mutual-fund
customers, Prudential-Bache Securities is planning a new
strategy: Let 'em in free.
   Prudential-Bache, which runs the country's 13th largest
fund group with $17 billion in assets, has asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to sell its
mutual funds to customers of other broker-sold mutual funds
-- without charging a sales commission.

   A Prudential-Bache spokesman declined to comment on the
filing, noting that the SEC still hasn't declared it
effective. But others note that, while Prudential-Bache, a
unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, may be the
largest fund group ever to make such an offer, its offer
isn't unique.
   "We've done it for three years, and we're not the first,"
said Edward Mahoney, president of AMEV Advisers Inc., which
allows owners of other broker-sold funds to buy AMEV funds,
provided they show proof that they sold the other fund within
the previous 60 days.
   The idea is to allow a broker to switch a customer between
funds without the client's being charged two sets of
commissions.
   What has Prudential-Bache got to attract other fund
customers? Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Co., a Boston mutual-fund
research firm, gives high marks to Prudential-Bache's utility
fund, its intermediate-term government-bond fund and its
convertible-bond fund. But overall, Kanon Bloch ranks
Prudential's fund family as 40th out of 94.
