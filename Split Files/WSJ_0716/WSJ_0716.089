   Philip Morris Cos.' $3.8 billion takeover bid for
Switzerland's Jacobs Suchard AG has big international
investors upset. The reason: favorable treatment for Klaus
Jacobs, Suchard's Swiss majority shareholder.
   Money managers and analysts say the proposed acquisition,
which gives Mr. Jacobs a 120% premium over other
shareholders, is a pointed example of the risks of investing
in foreign markets, especially as a minority shareholder.

   "The big issue here is the lack of minority shareholder
protection in many Continental European countries," says
Rudolf Leuthold, a managing director at J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc. in London. Says Joni Nelson, a
partner at Rogers &amp; Wells, a New York law firm: "It shows the
difference between how shareholder rights are perceived in
Continental Europe and elsewhere."
   Money managers warn that U.S. pension funds and other
investors, who are currently investing billions of dollars in
European stocks, could find themselves in similar situations
if local laws aren't changed.
   Philip Morris has agreed to purchase from Mr. Jacobs all
the voting shares of Colima Holding AG, a closely held
company that holds 62% of the voting rights in Suchard.
Through Colima, the U.S. tobacco and food company is making a
cash tender offer for the balance of the shares outstanding
-- there are five classes -- of Suchard, a Swiss coffee and
chocolate company.
   It will pay 1,660 Swiss francs ($1,184) for registered
shares and 8,500 francs ($6,063) for bearer shares, the par
value of which is five times that of the registered shares.
Both classes carry voting rights. Philip Morris also is
offering to pay 758 francs for participation certificates,
which have no voting rights. These prices -- as well as those
for warrants outstanding -- represent a premium of 26.7% from
the average daily closing price for the six months ending May
25.
   By contrast, Philip Morris is paying Mr. Jacobs 3,644
francs for each registered share, a huge 120% premium from
the 1660 francs being offered everyone else.
   "We, along with a number of investors, aren't terribly
happy, but there's not much we can do," says David Thomas, a
director at Equitable Life Assurance Society in London.
Britain's big Prudential Corp. PLC also is grumbling. And on
behalf of British institutions, the Association of British
Insurers has complained to the Association of Swiss Stock
Exchanges.
   "You have a U.S. company buying a Swiss company that has
U.S. shareholders who appear to be being discriminated
against," says Francis Finlay, chairman and chief executive
officer of Globe Finlay Inc., a New York-based international
money management firm.
   In U.S. and British takeovers, all shareholders generally
must be offered the same price. But that's not the case in
many European countries. Besides Switzerland, portfolio
managers specifically point to West Germany, the Netherlands
and Sweden as countries where foreign and minority
shareholders often get a raw deal.
   Philip Morris says it doesn't know how much of the 36%
minority stake is held by non-Swiss investors. Suchard
executives in Zurich didn't return telephone calls. "It is at
times like this that you get irritated that you are a
minority shareholder," says Henry de Vismes, head of
international investments at Citicorp's Citibank private
bank, which doesn't own any Suchard shares.
   Particularly upsetting to some investors is the fact that
Mr. Jacobs' 62% voting power represents no more than 30% of
Suchard's capital. And, says Sarah Lavers, an analyst at
Schroder Securities Ltd. in London: "If you look at any other
food company, the bid for the {Suchard} minority shares is
undervalued."
   Money managers say that in almost all other recent big
food acquisitions, purchasers paid a per-share price that was
at least 19 times earnings. But in the Suchard deal -- even
though Philip Morris's total costs come to a multiple of 26
-- the U.S. company's offer to minority shareholders
represents a price-earnings ratio of only 14.4 for registered
shares and 14.8 for bearer shares. Mr. Jacobs' stake, on the
other hand, is being bought at a multiple of 31.7, according
to a British investor.
   "One feels they {Philip Morris} didn't play fair as a U.S.
or U.K. company should," says Schroder's Ms. Lavers.
   And there's a pitfall for minority holders who might
choose not to sell. The offering document states that Philip
Morris intends to use a large chunk of Suchard's earnings to
boost the Swiss company's growth, which "may entail a
reduction of dividends." J. P. Morgan's Mr. Leuthold says:
"This is very prominently placed in the offering document and
amounts to a threat. You'd think that a company like Philip
Morris, which is a consumer-products manufacturer, would be
concerned about its image."
   Globe Finlay's Mr. Finlay concludes: "Our clients are left
with the option of being an oppressed minority or a
disadvantaged seller."
   A spokesman for New York-based Philip Morris argues that
the purchase of Mr. Jacobs's stake and the tender offer are
two separate transactions. He also notes that Swiss
authorities have ruled that Philip Morris's offer complies
with a voluntary takeover code adopted by the Swiss
exchanges' association last September. It calls for all
shareholders to be treated equally.
   The spokesman adds: "Although we aren't required under
Swiss law to go any further {after buying the majority
stake}, we are making an offer at a 27% premium."
Furthermore, he contends that after subtracting Mr. Jacobs's
acquisition of parts of Suchard that Philip Morris doesn't
want, his net receipts drop to 2,352 francs a share, a
premium of 42%, rather than 120%. Philip Morris regards its
acquisition and Mr. Jacobs's repurchases as a package deal.
   Dean LeBaron, trustee at Batterymarch Financial Management
in Boston, asserts that a controlling stake in a company "is,
in fact, worth a substantial premium."
   Mr. Leuthold of J.P. Morgan agrees that a majority stake
is worth more. "But," he contends, "120% seems to be plainly
excessive." Others see Philip Morris's contention that Mr.
Jacobs is really getting only a 42% premium as a red herring.
"It was his choice to buy back parts of the business; that
doesn't mean other shareholders should get penalized," says
Ms. Lavers of Schroder Securities. Some analysts also argue
that while Philip Morris's tender offer might pass muster
with Swiss authorities, the company is maneuvering on
technicalities.
   Still, not everyone is angry at Philip Morris. William
Green of RCB Trust Co., a manager of money managers in
Stamford, Conn, says that the tobacco company is merely
acting in the best interests of its shareholders. He also
sees a silver lining in the Suchard deal in that it could
accelerate further liberalization of the Swiss stock market.
   Rosalind Altman, chief international strategist at N.M.
Rothschild International Asset Management Ltd. in London
(which is related to Philip Morris's adviser), says: "This is
an encouraging step; nobody lost money." In the past, that
hasn't always been the case in Switzerland and other
Continental European markets. Shareholder rights "is an issue
that's very important for the future of European stock
markets and international investors," she adds.
   Penny Dobkin, Boston-based fund manager of the Fidelity
Europe Fund, says: "Just because we're American doesn't mean
our rules are right or that they are going to be accepted."
Due to receive 758 francs for each Suchard participation
share she bought at 600 this spring, she says: "I'm getting a
good gift."
   Nicholas Bratt, managing director at Scudder Stevens &amp;
Clark Inc., points out that most people who invest in Swiss
stocks are professionals and should know the risks. "You knew
you were going to be treated as a second or third-class
shareholder, and you made a conscious decision," he says.
   Noting that foreigners are still being offered a chance to
sell at a profit, Rogers &amp; Wells's Ms. Nelson says: "People
who have been given a Jaguar seem to be complaining that they
didn't get a Ferrari."
