   PARIS -- The chemical group Rhone-Poulenc S.A. announced
Friday that it has received a capital injection of 4.68
billion francs ($852 million) from the French government and
two state-owned companies that will help it trim its debt and
finance a recent acquisition binge.
   The financing will cover 3.4 billion francs directly from
the government, 850 million francs from the banking group
Credit Lyonnais and 425 million francs from the insurance
company Assurances Generales de France. Rhone-Poulenc said it
will use 1.4 billion francs of the money to reduce its debt
burden, while the remainder will finance its purchase of 35%
of the pharmaceuticals group Roussel-Uclaf S.A. from the
government earlier this year.

   Analysts had widely anticipated the fund raising after the
group decided to continue its brisk acquisition drive this
year despite heavy outlays that helped raise its debt by more
than 6.3 billion francs in 1989 to 20.6 billion francs.
   The particular structure of the capital boost had also
been anticipated as a way of making sure that the state's
control over essentially all of the voting power at
Rhone-Poulenc isn't diluted.
   As a result of the capital boost, Rhone-Poulenc will also
have room to issue as much as 2.5 billion francs of
additional nonvoting shares to the public, although the group
said it has no such plans for the immediate future. This is
because French companies are allowed to issue nonvoting
securities for as much as 25% of their voting capital.
