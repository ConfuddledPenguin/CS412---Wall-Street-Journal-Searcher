   WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted 916 for a bill designed to
ensure disabled people access to a broad range of work,
commercial and social activities. President Bush is expected
to sign the bill.
   The legislation, considered by some to be the most
significant civil-rights measure in more than 25 years, would
ban discrimination in public accommodations, employment,
ground transportation and telecommunications. The measure
would cover all but the smallest establishments and
employers.

   "For generations, society has viewed people with
disabilities as citizens in need of charity. . . . Today, we
are shedding these condescending and suffocating attitudes,
and widening the door of opportunity," said Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor Committee.
   The Senate vote backed a compromise wrapped up by
House-Senate conferees and approved Thursday by the House,
377-28. The final agreement included protection for workers
afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome; an
earlier version would have permitted employers to transfer
them.
   The bill also deleted an amendment that would have let
disabled job seekers or employees sue members of the Senate
for alleged job discrimination. While such suits would be
possible against private employers, disabled people alleging
discrimination by members of Congress would have to take
their complaints to special House and Senate boards.
