   SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. said it signed a
letter of intent to sell the assets and business of its
Multiwire division to Winthrop Investment Corp., a New York
financial holding company.
   Terms weren't disclosed. But Kollmorgen said the sale,
taken together with the recently reported sale of the
discrete wiring part of its PCK Technology division, wouldn't
significantly affect results.

   A maker of motors and electro-optical systems, Kollmorgen
earlier had said it would close the Multiwire division if it
failed to find a buyer.
