   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Faced with stagnant growth, Kay R.
Whitmore, Eastman Kodak Co.'s new chairman, is hitching the
company's future on an emerging technology.
   Mr. Whitmore, who two years ago pushed for Kodak's foray
into pharmaceuticals, now says the company's impetus for
growth must be electronic imaging. That's a switch for top
management at Kodak, which for years has focused on
traditional film photography, its core business for more than
a century.

   But with that aim comes great risk. Kodak has thrown its
hat into the ring with Sony, Canon and Matsushita, rivals
that have considerably more knowledge of electronics than
Kodak. It's a race that even the most optimistic Kodak
watchers doubt the company will win.
   "Once you move to electronic imaging, you must be
successful in electronic hardware, and why should one think
that Kodak will be successful in that?" says Eugene Glazer,
an analyst at Dean Witter.
   "There's a dozen companies already superior to Kodak" in
electronic hardware.
   But Mr. Whitmore, who also became chief executive officer,
believes his hand has been forced by the eclipse of
traditional photography. The absence of new technology has
damped picture-taking activity. Also hurting film and paper
demand is slow birth rates, which means fewer toothless
smiles to photograph.
   "To protect the long-range viability of our photography
business, we've got to get into electronic imaging," Mr.
Whitmore said. "The question is how to do that in a way that
creates value and doesn't consume all your resources. That's
the challenge for this management group."
   Kodak is now spending one-quarter of its $1.3 billion
annual research and development budget on electronic imaging;
the technology broadly refers to filmless cameras that record
pictures on computerized disks then play the images on
display screens. In years past, electronic imaging had been a
divisive issue at Kodak because many employees feared the
technology would replace the company's traditional
photography business of film and paper.
   But Mr. Whitmore has calmed concerns, for now, by saying
Kodak will strive to be leaders in both areas. "He's taken a
definitive stand," says Roger Van Heyningen, who supervises
Kodak's electronic imaging research efforts.
   Kodak managers have recognized for more than 20 years the
impact this new field could have on the company. But past
chief executives had ducked taking a definitive stand on its
importance, insiders say. By contrast, Mr. Whitmore, in his
very first speech a month ago to employees after taking over
the reins from Colby Chandler, said Kodak will have as its
aim "being the world's best in both electronic and
{traditional} imaging," Mr. Van Heyningen says. "It was very
encouraging."
   What that means in practical terms, though, is still
unclear. Kodak has already introduced some hybrid products,
which combine film and electronics. So, too, have the
Japanese. But the day when electronic imaging plays a major
role at Kodak, if ever, is well past year 2000. Kodak's own
internal forecast is that by 2010, 30% of all pictures will
be captured through electronic means rather than film, as the
expense of systems fall and amateurs use them.
   Meanwhile, the 57-year-old Mr. Whitmore has few fast
horses to ride in Kodak's other core businesses of
information systems, chemicals and pharmeceuticals while it
waits for electronic imaging to develop. That means
bottom-line improvements are likely to come from lowering
costs and trimming fat, although Wall Street complains that
Kodak uses the liquid diet approach when liposuction is
needed. Last year, Kodak eliminated 10,000 positions and now
has 137,000 employees.
   Kodak's Sterling Drug unit, which the company hoped would
offset slow growth in photo sales, remains a question mark.
Mr. Whitmore is betting that Sterling will develop new drugs,
and the unit is pursuing research ventures with other drug
companies. At best, however, Sterling won't make a meaningful
contribution to earnings until the second half of the decade.
   Mr. Whitmore's ability to position Kodak could be severely
hampered by the settlement of a patent lawsuit that Kodak
lost to the Poloroid Corp. Damages will be determined by a
U.S. District Court in Boston, although no one knows when the
ruling will be made. Mr. Whitmore said if the judgment falls
in the range of analysts' estimates -- from $1 billion to $2
billion -- Kodak won't have to sell assets. Many analysts
believe Kodak will have to take such steps if the company has
to pay more than $2 billion, and Sterling is usually
mentioned as the most likely candidate.
   Mr. Whitmore denied rumors that he had put Sterling on the
block, but he declined to say how Kodak would pay
higher-than-expected damages. Asked which business segment he
was least enamored with, he responded, "Today I'm enamored
with all of them."
