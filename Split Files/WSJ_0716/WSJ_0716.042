   MONTREAL -- Blaming soft prices and rising costs, Alcan
Aluminium Ltd. said second-quarter net income fell 66% from a
year earlier, a steeper drop than analysts expected.
   Alcan said net was $84 million, or 35 cents a share,
compared with $244 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue in the second quarter was $2.17 billion, compared
with $2.4 billion in 1989.

   "It's a classic situation: Costs are rising, the commodity
price is dropping, and their margins are being squeezed,"
said Julian Baldry, an analyst at Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.
in Toronto.
   Mr. Baldry, who has been bearish on aluminum stocks since
last year, said Alcan's earnings will continue dropping
quarter-over-quarter in the second half. He expects Alcan to
report third-quarter net of 31 cents a share and
fourth-quarter net of 25 cents a share. He said his estimate
is based on aluminum ingot prices falling to about 60 cents a
pound by the end of the year. Aluminum ingot prices averaged
about 70 cents a pound in the second quarter.
   Alcan's earnings were "worse than I had feared," said
Thomas Van Leeuwen, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
But Mr. Van Leeuwen and other U.S. analysts see an
improvement in the second half. "There isn't any reason to
think that things will be as glum in the third quarter," Mr.
Van Leeuwen said.
   Attention this week will be on Alcan's two big
competitors. Aluminum Co. of America will report its
second-quarter earnings today, an Alcoa spokesman said.
   Reynolds Metals Co. will report today or tomorrow, a
Reynolds spokesman said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Alcan
closed down 62.5 cents at $23.25. But while Alcan shares
slipped Friday, Alcoa and Reynolds followed the broader
market higher. Alcoa closed up 50 cents at $68.75, while
Reynolds closed up 25 cents at $63.25.
   Alcan said shipments of aluminum ingot in the second
quarter rose slightly to 202,000 metric tons from 197,000
metric tons a year earlier, while shipments of fabricated
products dropped to 379,000 metric tons from 396,000 metric
tons. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   Alcan said earnings in Latin America fell significantly in
the second quarter because of economic conditions in Brazil.
The company said that profit was down in Europe as well,
largely because of an economic slowdown in the United
Kingdom. Earnings in North America were down from a year
earlier but showed some improvement over the first quarter,
the company said.
   "While metal prices in the second quarter were
unsatisfactory, industry fundamentals remain stable, with
inventories under control and operating rates high," said
David Morton, chairman and chief executive officer. He added
that continuing, albeit slower, economic growth "gives us
reason to be confident in our outlook for the industry and
Alcan."
   For the first six months, Alcan had net of $256 million,
or $1.09 a share, compared with $513 million, or $2.21 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue was $4.36 billion, compared
with $4.70 billion. Total shipments of ingot and fabricated
products in the first six months were about flat at 1,148,000
metric tons, compared with 1,150,000 metric tons a year
earlier.
