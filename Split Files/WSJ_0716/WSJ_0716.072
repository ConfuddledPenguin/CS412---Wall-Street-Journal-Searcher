   NEW YORK -- Bird Inc., meeting with financial analysts
here, said it expects earnings from continuing operations to
be 45 cents to 50 cents a share for the second quarter,
compared with one cent a share in the corresponding quarter
last year.
   Despite depressed conditions in the housing market, the
building materials distributor said its performance improved
with the help of concentration in its repair and remodeling
sector, and with its plant modernization programs.

   In the year-ago second quarter, ended June 30, 1989, a
$5.3-million gain on the sale of one of Bird's units, plus a
tax-loss carryforward of $3.3 million, brought final net
income to about $9 million, or $2 a share. Sales were $32.7
million.
   Final results for the 1990 second quarter are to be
released later this month.
   Earnings from continued operations for the first six
months of 1990 are expected to be approximately 60 cents a
share, compared with 11 cents in the year-ago period.
   The Westwood, Mass., concern said that it plans to sell a
40% interest in its Housing Group in a private placement of
securities. The offering is managed by C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc.
