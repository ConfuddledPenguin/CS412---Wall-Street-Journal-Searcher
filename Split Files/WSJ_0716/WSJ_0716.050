   LONDON -- Britain's pound sterling for a time last week
became the darling of the foreign exchange markets, having
moved to a nicer neighborhood, in the vicinity of $1.80 and
three deutsche marks. Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major,
hobnobbing with the likes of EC President Jacques Delors in
Houston, nonetheless felt it necessary to reassure the
British industrialists back home. Not to worry, he said, a
stronger pound will do British industry no harm.
   One wonders why reassurance was necessary. Strong
currencies have certainly done no harm to the industries of
France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Austria, to name a few
examples. The four are tied to the Deutsche mark and they
have learned to like it. France, Ireland and Holland are part
of the EC's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Austria is not a
member of the EC but would like to be and fixed its schilling
to the mark long ago. Last year, it enjoyed a 4% growth in
GNP, as did, for that matter, Germany. Holland did even
better and Ireland, too, hit a 4% growth rate.

   If having a strong currency did none of these countries
any harm, what exactly is England's problem? It's a bit hard
to say. Both England and the United States enjoyed strong
growth in the mid-1980s, when both had put their currencies
on a much stronger footing. There has been a significant
learning curve in England since the bad old days of Labor
governments, when the conventional wisdom was that a country
could devalue its way to prosperity, but the idea that a
strong currency makes industry "uncompetitive" dies hard.
Over time, and sometimes after not very long, it does just
the opposite, forcing fundamental improvements in industrial
efficiency and damping down inflation and the consequent wage
demands.
   There are some technical aspects to Britain's inflation
problem. Financial deregulation in the 1980s -- all in the
interest of enhancing London's role as a major international
capital market -- has left Britain more vulnerable to "hot
money flows." Bank of England operatives claim that the lack
of any controls over the movement of capital makes it harder
to manage the pound. When real interest rates in England are
raised, for example as part of the Bank's efforts to
discourage borrowing, the hot money comes flowing in from
abroad, defeating efforts to restrict the supply of money and
credit, and hence, the bank's efforts to contain inflation.
   It also is often argued that British inflation is not as
high as it seems, because the rate was affected by the new
community services tax, which is included in the Consumer
Price Index. Whereas the CPI reading is approaching double
digits, the underlying inflation rate, by various estimates,
is only 6% to 6.5% annually.
   But somehow these arguments don't hold up very well when
used by those who insist that Britain is not yet ready to
enter the ERM. For one thing, why is it that the countries
that do belong to the ERM have so little problem with hot
money flows? For another, 6.5%, although not as high as 9.5%,
still is high compared to the rates the ERM countries have
been enjoying. Moreover, it is high enough to cause the
British economy and Mrs. Thatcher significant problems. For
example, British labor is again getting restive under the
pressures of inflation.
   When the pound began its recent rise, there was much
speculation that Britain was preparing to enter the ERM,
which no doubt further contributed to the currency's
strength. But Mr. Major, while reassuring British
industrialists, also tried to discourage the idea that entry
into the ERM was imminent. Market hopes were further dashed
by that strange outburst by Britain's Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, Nicholas Ridley, who managed to get
himself quoted in the Spectator Thursday as having uttered
violently anti-German remarks. He equated any surrender of
British sovereignty to giving it to Adolph Hitler, which
didn't sound much like the Thatcher administration was ready
to enter a monetary union dominated by the Dmark. Mrs.
Thatcher later took Mr. Ridley to the woodshed and said his
views were not the views of her government.
   Mrs. Thatcher was probably genuinely shocked at her
secretary's remarks, especially after having just returned
from an economic summit that went surprisingly well. But
quite possibly she has not yet chomped down on the bullet
that entry into the ERM represents. The Brits are in a bit of
a muddle in that they don't seem willing to throw in with the
continent on this issue and yet they bridle at suggestions
from the continent that maybe European Monetary Union (EMU)
will just have to go along without them, on a two-track
system. Mr. Major's alternative idea, creating a new "hard"
European Currency Unit (ECU) that would be publicly
circulated as money that could be spent in any of the 12 EC
member nations, has received a polite reception from the EC,
but there is little sign that the other members are prepared
to back off on the Delors plan for monetary union. The Major
idea has some merit, as it happens, in that it would give the
ECU a public test, supplementing the use already being made
of ECUs as a unit of account in commercial transactions. But
Britain still risks the possibility that the EMU will go
trotting off without her.
   Indeed, the Delors plan, which was endorsed by the EC
Council of Ministers in Madrid just over a year ago, came
into play at the beginning of this month. Stage one is a
relatively easy one, calling for full liberalization of
capital movements within the community and greater
cooperation of member nations on economic and monetary
policy. There is no hard and fast timetable for stage two but
the requirements get a lot tougher. At that point a European
System of Central Banks (ESCB) would be set up and the
process of transferring monetary policy decision making from
national authorities to this new EC creature would begin. The
third stage of the plan calls for locking exchange rates
irrevocably and transferring all monetary power to the ESCB.
At that point the ESCB would also control exchange market
interventions involving non-EC currencies.
   The merits of a single currency are fairly obvious. The
time and money spent exchanging currencies and trying to
hedge against exchange rate fluctuations is very costly to
industry, and for that matter, to individuals. There are
legitimate worries that the ESCB would conduct monetary
policy at the level of the lowest common denominator, giving
all of Europe inflation, but the Germans are determined not
to let that happen, or at least seem so.
   So the question is, what is England waiting for,
particularly given the good track record of the other ERM
nations? Maybe it is waiting for the likes of Mr. Ridley to
give their OKs. Maybe it will happen tomorrow. Presumably,
Mrs. Thatcher knows the answer, but she isn't telling.
