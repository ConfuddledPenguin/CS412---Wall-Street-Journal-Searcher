   Bowing to political pressure, a Commerce Department agency
said that by September it will propose a standard for
computer security that experts say will be a boon for the
high-tech industry.
   John Lyons, director of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, the agency in charge of producing a
standard, said Friday that work on a proposed standard should
be completed "in a matter of a few weeks" and will be
published "by the end of summer."

   The standard should help the spread of electronic-data
communications by encouraging computer-network operators to
install a single method of ensuring that documents sent via
computer networks are authentic and haven't been altered. But
because such an approach to security, called public-key
cryptography, also provides a defense against computer
snoops, it has prompted opposition from the National Security
Agency, the nation's chief electronic spy.
   Members of Congress and officials in the computer industry
have complained about opposition from the NSA.
   The NSA, one of the government's most secretive agencies,
declines to say publicly why it fears such improvements in
electronic communications. Mr. Lyons says the NSA's
objections turn on national security concerns, but he
wouldn't be specific.
   RSA Data Security Inc., a tiny concern in Redwood City,
Calif., controls the most widely used approach to public-key
cryptography. Experts say the federal government probably
should adopt RSA Data's approach, since it is popular in
Europe and catching on in the U.S.
   But there are other alternatives. "Technically, its an
open question," said Willis Ware, a computer scientist at
Rand Corp. who chairs a Commerce Department advisory
committee on computer security.
   Mr. Ware said that while RSA Data "has got a corner on the
marketplace," there may be weaknesses in the company's
approach to security that are only known by the NSA.
