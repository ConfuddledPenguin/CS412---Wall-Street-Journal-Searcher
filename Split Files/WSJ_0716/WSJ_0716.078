   NEW YORK -- The U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Nomura
Securities Co. named Robert Levine, a top Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. official, to head a new department to conduct credit
research and design new fixed-income products for
corporations.
   Mr. Levine's hiring is a key step in Max C. Chapman Jr.'s
effort to convert Nomura's American operations from a
mediocre broker-dealer to a competitive U.S.-style investment
bank. Since he became co-chairman of Nomura's U.S. unit in
October 1989, Mr. Chapman has been pulling Nomura away from
being a firm that mainly acted as a middle-man buying and
selling stocks and bonds for customers to one emphasizing
aggressive asset and liability management.

   At its core, credit research involves determining how much
debt a company can carry and still operate successfully. But
Mr. Levine said that he and the team he will build would go
beyond that, "assessing corporate strategies with an eye to
evaluating different options that a corporation has." Credit
research, he added, "is really the engine that drives the
assessment of corporate securities."
   At Kidder, which he joined in 1977, Mr. Levine was a
managing director and president of Kidder, Peabody High Yield
Asset Management Inc., which Wall Street sources said managed
about $750 million. In 1989, he created the first publicly
underwritten asset-backed bond involving high-yield debt.
   Mr. Levine, 45, will be a senior vice president at Nomura
Securities International Inc., the U.S. subsidiary, beginning
today. He is the third senior Kidder executive to be lured
away by Mr. Chapman since he came to Nomura. Mr. Chapman is a
former president of Kidder.
   Two of Mr. Chapman's goals have been to develop Nomura's
capability to apply sophisticated, quantitative methods that
use computers to do securities trading and to assist U.S.
companies in converting their heavy debt loads to stock. He
also intends to aggressively manage and commit Nomura's own
capital, something that traditionally risk-averse Japanese
firms aren't known for.
   Mr. Chapman's efforts are especially important to Nomura's
parent company in Tokyo as well as its U.S. operations.
American securities firms such as Salomon Brothers Inc.,
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. -- all more
technologically advanced -- have invaded Nomura's own
domestic market using mathematically oriented techniques and
derivative instruments, such as futures and options, to trade
Japanese stocks in Tokyo.
   To address these issues, Mr. Chapman has already hired an
expert in derivative products, two of Wall Street's
best-known program traders and a leading trader of takeover
stocks, or risk-arbitrager.
   Mr. Levine, with a background in designing new bond
products for corporations, will fit into this group, said Mr.
Chapman. "High quality credit research is essential to our
efforts in committing capital and merchant banking," said Mr.
Chapman.
   Apart from some previous investments in U.S. leasing, real
estate and merger companies -- all of which are related to
its investment banking business -- Nomura hasn't actively
engaged in merchant banking, which involves taking a stake in
a company for investment reasons.
