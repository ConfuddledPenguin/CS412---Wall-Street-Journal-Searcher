   WASHINGTON -- The government's latest economic reports
suggest that inflation is somewhat under control and that
consumer spending may be experiencing a modest upturn.
   Producer prices for finished goods rose a moderate 0.2% in
June, following a 0.3% increase in May and a 0.3% decline in
April, the Labor Department said. In a separate report, the
Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.5% in June, the
first increase in three months.

   "These two reports give us a win-win situation at least in
the short term," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the
National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors in
Washington.
   The new figures may have contributed to the Federal
Reserve's decision to ease its grip on credit Friday for the
first time since December.
   For the most part, analysts said they were encouraged by
the June producer price figures even though, excluding foods
and energy, prices of finished goods rose 0.6%. About half
the increase was in tobacco and automobiles.
   However, on the down side, economists said a lower rate of
inflation often reflects a weakening in production stemming
from a slowdown in demand.
   In the 12 months ended in June, overall producer price
inflation was 3.1%, the department said.
   Prices of intermediate goods, which have had some
processing, declined for the second month in a row, falling
0.2% in June after a 0.1% drop in May.
   Prices of crude goods also decreased, plunging 2.4% last
month, after significant drops in the three previous months.
   The producer price index measures the prices factories and
other producers receive for their goods. It doesn't track
services.
   Also sparking a bit of hope for the strength of the
economy, retail sales totaled $147.82 billion in June, after
falling 0.6%, to $147.04 billion in May, the Commerce
Department said.
   "The retail trade report gives us more confidence that the
consumer has not totally withdrawn from the retail market,"
said Stacy Kottman, an economist for the Economic Forecasting
Center at Georgia State University.
   "Consumers are still being conservative; they are still
being cautious, but if we had had a fourth month of decline,
we would have to start talking recession," Mr. Kottman said.
   Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last more than
three years -- declined 0.1% in June, following a 0.3%
decline in May. Sales of nondurable goods increased 0.9% in
June, after falling 0.7% the previous month.
   Automobile sales edged up 0.1% in June -- for the first
rise in four months -- following a 0.2% drop in May.
   Furniture sales dropped 1.9%. Building materials sales
increased 1.3%. Purchases at apparel and accessory stores
moved up 0.7% and department-store sales jumped 2.9%.
   Excluding automobile sales, which fluctuate widely from
month to month, overall retail sales were up 0.7%.
   All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal variations.
