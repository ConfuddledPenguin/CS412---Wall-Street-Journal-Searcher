   LONDON -- Hungary's state mineral trading company,
Mineralimpex, and international energy trader Phibro Energy
AG have formed a joint venture international mineral trading
company, a Mineralimpex official said.
   The company, called Allcom Trading Co., began operations
July 1, trading "nonferrous ores, aluminum and oil products,"
the Hungarian official said.

   The official said Hungarian law prohibited the new company
from trading certain minerals, including iron ore and
domestically produced crude oil.
   The Mineralimpex official didn't specify the breakdown of
shares in the partnership, but Hungarian joint ventures
usually have been split 50-50 between Hungarian and foreign
partners in the past.
   The Mineralimpex official didn't give any further details
of the venture, and Phibro officials weren't available to
comment.
