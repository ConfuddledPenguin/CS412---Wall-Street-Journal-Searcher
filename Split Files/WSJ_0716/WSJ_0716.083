   DALLAS -- First RepublicBank Corp. said it appears to have
won sufficient votes from bondholders and shareholders to
confirm its plan to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.
   If the company's preliminary tabulation is upheld by the
federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, the vote would
represent a setback for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which in 1988 seized the First RepublicBank banking network
and sold it to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.

   The FDIC, which claims First RepublicBank owes the agency
over $1 billion, has requested that the judge appoint a
trustee to liquidate the company's remaining assets.
   First RepublicBank's plan, on the other hand, calls for
the company's assets to be managed and sold by a board of
directors controlled by creditors. Under the plan, the
company would establish a fund to pay the FDIC pending the
outcome of several lawsuits filed in federal district court
here challenging the propriety of the agency's 1988 bank
seizures.
   Richard Carrington, the company's chairman and chief
executive, called the vote "gratifying" and added: "It will
be interesting to see whether this particular event serves as
a catalyst in setting settlement talks" in the district court
cases.
   Meanwhile, a trial is set to begin today in bankruptcy
court to decide whether First RepublicBank's reorganization
plan or the FDIC's liquidation plan is in the best interest
of creditors. First RepublicBank isn't related to First
Republic Bancorp of San Francisco.
