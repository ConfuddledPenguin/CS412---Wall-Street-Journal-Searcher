   LONDON -- A leading minister's swift resignation over
anti-German remarks has spared Britain a crisis in its
relations with Europe, political analysts say. But the
publication yesterday of further high-level and unflattering
musings on the German character could continue to poison
relations over the short term.
   Nicholas Ridley, Britain's trade and industry secretary
and a close ally of Margaret Thatcher, resigned Saturday
following an interview in which he said that surrendering
sovereignty to the EC was like giving "it to Adolf Hitler."
He was replaced by Peter Lilley, a low-profile official who
is believed to share his predecessor's skepticism about the
EC, but not Mr. Ridley's xenophobia or clout.

   "Nick Ridley was one of the very last of Thatcher's
ministers who is not a total mediocrity," says Ben Pimlott, a
professor of politics at the University of London. He
describes Mr. Ridley's replacement as an "Identikit, B-plus,
moderately able young Tory on the make who no one has ever
heard of." As a result, he says, those who resist European
economic and monetary union have lost a powerful advocate and
"suffered a major defeat."
   Conservative colleagues of Mr. Lilley praised the new
trade secretary as a bright and able man who, like Ms.
Thatcher and Mr. Ridley, favors a cautious, free-market
approach to European unity. But press reports yesterday
shattered hopes that Mr. Ridley's resignation, and government
repudiation of his remarks, would make the incident no more
than a hiccup. A leaked memorandum revealed that Ms. Thatcher
held a meeting in March to assess the German character at
which ministers and leading academics listed, "as an abiding
part of the German character," the following traits: "angst,
aggressiveness, assertiveness, bullying, egotism, inferiority
complex, sentimentality."
   While there was consensus among the group that Germany was
no longer bent on world conquest, "the way in which Germans
currently used their elbows and threw their weight about in
the European community suggested that a lot had still not
changed." The memorandum ends on a patronizing note: "We
should be nice to the Germans."
   Foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, who was present at the
meeting, confirmed the content of the memorandum yesterday
but said in a television interview that "the verdict {at the
meeting} was overwhelming reassuring. . . . It is a fantasy
to suppose that we're going to be faced with a new Hitler or
a new Gestapo."
   The report, however, fueled suspicions that Mr. Ridley's
outburst last week reflected the opinions of Ms. Thatcher --
and of a large segment of the British population. In one of
many surveys over the weekend, 36% of those polled said Mr.
Ridley's comments about the Germans and French, though
undiplomatic, "reflected the views of most British people,"
while 34% disagreed (the rest had no opinion). Mr. Ridley
said the French were "behaving like poodles to the Germans,"
the Germans were "uppity," and that plans for European
monetary union were "all a German racket designed to take
over the whole of Europe."
   Analysts say the embarrassment over Mr. Ridley's remarks
may result in conciliatory, pro-Europe moves by British
officials and a more frank domestic debate about economic
union. Mr. Lilley's posture also will be scrutinized. At 46
years old, the former Treasury official is the youngest
member of the Cabinet and a member of No Turning Back, a
group of right-wing Torys. He also is "an English Gaullist
who believes strongly in sovereignty within the European
community," says David Nicholson, a Conservative member of
Parliament and longtime colleague.
