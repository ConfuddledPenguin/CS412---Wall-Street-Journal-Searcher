   NEW YORK -- Missing a deadline in an arbitration case can
throw Wall Street for a loop.
   Just ask Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

   In a ruling released last week, a New York state court
justice said Shearson can't force an investor to take a
dispute to its choice of arbitration panel.
   The reason: The big securities firm missed a 20-day
deadline to formally respond to the investor's request for an
arbitration hearing. It seems Shearson failed to file a
one-paragraph notice informing the court about where it
wanted the dispute heard.
   To some that might sound like a mere technicality. But
some lawyers and arbitration specialists say it happens more
and more with Wall Street securities firms being inundated
with arbitration claims, which have doubled from 1986 levels.
And it goes to the heart of a hot topic in securities
arbitration.
   Brokerage houses are "under the gun to come up with
substantive answers very quickly, and case management is poor
at the larger firms," says David Robbins, former arbitration
director at the American Stock Exchange who currently works
for a New York law firm.
   Many investors sign a standard agreement when they open an
account that binds them to arbitration, instead of court, in
case of a dispute with their broker. Most customers want to
have disputes resolved by panels that don't have strong ties
to the securities business. But the standard brokerage
agreements at most Wall Street firms often require investors
to take their cases to industry-sponsored forums, such as
that of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
   The Shearson case stemmed from a dispute with an
83-year-old investor who allegedly lost more than $600,000 in
his Shearson brokerage account during the 1987 stock-market
crash. The investor, William Wiedenmeier, wanted to bring the
case before the American Arbitration Association, which is
privately funded and considered by many to be more
sympathetic to investor claims.
   Shearson wanted to steer the case to an industry-sponsored
forum; it served a petition to the court to strike down the
investor's request to bring the case to the AAA. But Shearson
filed a formal notice to the court, informing it of the
firm's position, 24 days after the investor's petition. And
that, said Justice Irma Santaella, was "jurisdictionally
defective." New York state law says such responses are
required within 20 days.
   Shearson wasn't available for comment.
   Even without the technicality, however, Justice Santaella
has allowed investors to take their cases to independent
forums in other similar cases, arbitration specialists say.
