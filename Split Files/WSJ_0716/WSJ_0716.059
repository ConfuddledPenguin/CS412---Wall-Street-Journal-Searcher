   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged an "unknown" group of investors with insider trading
of Contel Corp. securities in connection with the company's
plan to merge with GTE Corp.
   Only about 30 hours after the accord between the two phone
companies was announced, the SEC received a temporary
restraining order from the U.S. District Court in New York
blocking 12 U.S. and foreign banks and securities firms from
disposing of Contel stock and options. The agency contended
that paper gains from transactions through the foreign banks
totaled nearly $1.1 million. Rudolph Gerlich Jr., an SEC
assistant enforcement director, said the agency expects
Contel trading profit through American Express Co.'s Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. unit, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and
Advest Inc. to total roughly an additional $1 million.

   None of the banks or securities firms are charged with any
wrongdoing. But they will be asked by the SEC for the names
of their customers, who will then be deposed by agency
lawyers as to why they bought the securities.
   The SEC said it was forced to move quickly -- even before
it could determine the identity of any defendant -- because
the options settle a day after they are sold. That means that
the money would be turned over to the investors and "the
money can be gone pretty fast," Mr. Gerlich said.
   The $6.2 billion deal, announced Thursday morning, was
preceded by purchases of thousands of Contel options
contracts on the American Stock Exchange floor, according to
SEC and Amex data. The SEC said in its complaint that for
July 5, 6 and 9, total Contel call option volume on the Amex
was 329 contracts. But during the two days before the
announcement of the deal, that volume jumped nearly 20-fold
to 6,546 contracts, the agency said.
   The SEC said that the defendants made their transactions
in accounts at the three U.S. brokerage firms and Credit
Suisse and Compagnie de Gestion, Geneva, through Swiss
American Securities Inc. of New York; Union Bank of
Switzerland, Geneva, through Execution Services Inc. of New
York; Confide Finance S.A. of Bellevue, Switzerland, through
Kidder, Peabody & Co.; and Simonbank of Dusseldorf, West
Germany, through Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co.
   The charges are the second major SEC insider-trading
complaint in the past few months focusing on investments
through Switzerland. In January, the SEC charged several
firms and investors with insider trading in Rorer Group Inc.
securities before that company's acquisition by Rhone-Poulenc
S.A. Those trades were done through Discount Bank Ltd. and
Cambio Valorenbank AG, Swiss banks that weren't charged with
any wrongdoing.
   Call options give an investor the right, but not the
obligation, to buy shares of stock at a certain price within
a given time. They generally move in tandem with the price of
the underlying stock.
   The charges came as little surprise to traders on the Amex
floor. "There was a completely different trading pattern in
the options" than usual, said one trader. An SEC official
said the pattern was so blatant that "you just couldn't miss
it."
   Securities lawyers remarked at the surge of volume.
"There's either some innocent person with a good explanation
or a real dumb person who's really in trouble," said
Washington securities lawyer Peter Romatowski.
   The accord between the two phone companies had been
brewing for several months, the SEC said. The agency's
complaint said GTE first considered Contel as a possible
target in late 1989 or early this year, but decided not to
contact the Atlanta-based company. In late April or early
May, Stamford, Conn.-based GTE renewed its consideration of a
deal, but Contel ended the talks after preliminary
discussions.
   Early this month, the talks reheated, and the two firms
agreed on July 5 that they would merge. Top executives agreed
to announce the accord on July 12. In the interim, draft
documents were exchanged between lawyers for the two
companies and GTE investment bankers were notified.
