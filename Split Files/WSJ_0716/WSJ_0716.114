   WASHINGTON -- At least a quarter of the world's population
-- or more than one billion people -- now live on less than
$370 a year, the World Bank says. The international agency
adds that the number of poor people could be cut as much as
40% by the end of the century if poor countries provide
income-earning opportunities and basic social services.
   In the meantime, developed countries should maintain or
increase their levels of aid, the World Bank says in its
annual development report. But the aid should be tightly
linked to a country's efforts to reduce poverty, the report
advises.

   More than half of the poorest peoples live in South Asia,
in countries such as India and Bangladesh, with most of the
remainder living in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
   The report, which is being released today, focuses on
poverty. It sets out a dual strategy for improving the lot of
the world's poor-people who survive on about a dollar a day
or less.
   But for poverty to be reduced appreciably, many developing
countries will have to alter their current policies, the bank
says. It is scathing about some strategies: "Many past
policies meant to benefit the rural poor have failed; land
reform barely helped the poor, except after wars or
revolutions; subsidized credit programs not only benefited
the rich much more than the poor but ran into serious
debt-repayment problems; and excessive taxation of
agriculture contributed to poor results."
   Too often, the report says, formal social security plans
and health policies have failed to benefit the poorest
people. It says that targeted food subsidies often work
better than general food subsidies, and also recommends
public-employment programs.
   Through such policies, some countries have had remarkable
success in shrinking poverty. For example, Indonesia reduced
the share of its population living in poverty to less than
20% from 60% in less than a generation, according to Lyn
Squire, who led the team that authored the report.
   Controlling population growth is another challenge facing
the poorest countries. The World Bank estimates that another
850 million people will be born in the remainder of the
decade. In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, fast population
growth threatens to worsen poverty.
   Donor countries too, will have to make sure they provide
enough aid to countries making serious efforts to reduce
poverty, the report says. On current projections, aid is
expected to increase 2% a year, according to the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That
implies aid will total $64 billion in the year 2000, up 25%
from $51 billion in 1988.
   World Bank President Barber Conable told reporters
recently that as "the Cold War wanes, developed countries can
afford more aid." He added that if developed countries cut
their military spending by 10% they could double their aid."
   If donor countries were more generous and pegged their aid
at the "widely accepted" level of 0.7% of gross national
product, aid could increase to as much as $144 billion by the
end of the century, the World Bank says. Among rich nations,
Saudi Arabia, the Scandinavian countries and Holland are the
most generous when aid is measured as a percentage of GNP.
Saudi Arabia's aid in 1988 totaled 2.7% of national output,
the World Bank says. Ireland and the U.S. are the least
generous, with aid totaling about 0.2% of GNP, the
international agency says, quoting OECD figures.
