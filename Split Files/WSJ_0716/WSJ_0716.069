   WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence analysts say the Soviet
Union's move toward democracy is probably irreversible, and
they believe the nation will become a multiparty democracy in
the 1990s.
   This assessment, according to senior administration
officials familiar with the intelligence analyses, is
tempered with warnings that the road to Soviet democracy will
be rocky. The analysts say that the Soviet economy is headed
for more chaos and fragmentation, that several of the 15
Soviet republics will be leaving the union and that the
Kremlin will face a new wave of ethnic violence and strikes
as national groups and independent trade unions gain power.

   Still, says a senior administration official, explaining
the intelligence community's view: "There's a real decent
chance that democratic trends will continue and be
consolidated. It's better than 50-50." The official says the
Soviet Union's current experiment with democracy at every
level of government "goes much deeper" than the attempts at a
liberal system during the feeble pre-Bolshevik Kerensky
government in 1917. And, the official adds, "It will be
harder to resist."
   This generally positive assessment reinforces President
Bush's and Secretary of State James Baker's personal
admiration for Mikhail Gorbachev, who unleashed the
democratization process and hopes to be its beneficiary, and
it may be one reason Mr. Bush is standing so firmly by Mr.
Gorbachev.
   Even if a hard-line dictator were to oust the current
regime, the intelligence community doesn't believe he could
block the march of democracy for more than a few years. "At
this point, they can't totally arrest it," the senior
official says.
   But in this analysis, the good news about democracy is
balanced by bad news for Soviet leaders on just about every
other front. U.S. analysts say that as power flows from the
Kremlin to Soviet republics and local governments, violence
will grow. "Newly enfranchised ethnic majorities will be
settling scores with local minorities," the official says.
   On top of these troubles, U.S. analysts take a dim view of
Soviet economic prospects. Exports of oil and weapons are
expected to keep falling, further squeezing the supply of
hard currency needed to finance imports of food and consumer
goods. The country's external debt and trade deficit are
expected to mount ominously.
   The intelligence agencies don't offer any precise
predictions on the political outcome of all this. Mr.
Gorbachev is expected to hang on to political control for the
foreseeable future, but the central government and party he
heads are expected to lose power. In any case, the analysts
say, he's unlikely to be in power for the decade or more that
will be required to carry out even those reforms that have
already been started.
   The intelligence agencies now take a generally more
positive view of maverick Russian Republic chief Boris
Yeltsin, who caused a stir Thursday by publicly resigning
from the Soviet Communist Party. Mr. Yeltsin used to be
written off as a lightweight demagogue. But, said the
official who discussed the agencies' analysis: "We overuse
the word `demagogue.' Yeltsin is a complex figure. He's the
most obvious national figure" among the reformers.
   The intelligence community concedes that some of Mr.
Yeltsin's behavior has been bizarre and self-destructive,
probably indicating a mild emotional or psychological
problem. But he is viewed as a first-rate political
strategist, someone who is more intelligent than he seems and
is worthy of U.S. respect.
