   Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management Inc., known for
picking winners in the treacherous over-the-counter market,
sees 1990 as the year when small stocks begin to regain some
of their former glamour.
   "It's a double-win situation," says Fred C. Applegate,
president of the six-year-old San Diego company. He expects
1991 earnings of the companies in the firm's two growth
portfolios to surge more than three times as fast as a
projected 5.2% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. And he says
there's finally evidence that investors are willing to pay
more for that rapid earnings growth.

   The firm manages $2.3 billion, most of it in two funds
holding small- and medium-sized stocks for more than 70
institutional clients. Its strong record has attracted even
such staid clients as the Sisters of the Holy Cross and Yale
University.
   Though small stocks have lagged the market for years, in
Mr. Applegate's view, "1990 is the year of transition." Over
the past 20 years, he says, investors have paid 50% to 100%
premiums over the market's multiple of earnings to buy
emerging growth stocks, which now sell at little or no such
premium to the market.
   "Small to medium growth (stocks) are starting to perform
better," he says, though he cautions: "Small by itself still
doesn't have the wind at its back."
   Neither Mr. Applegate nor Arthur E. Nicholas, chairman and
chief investment officer, are Johnnies-come-lately to the OTC
market. Since 1977, Mr. Nicholas's emerging growth investment
strategies have produced average compounded annual returns of
24.9%, first at San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank, where he was
a portfolio manager, and later at a $2.5 billion investment
subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp., where he was chief
investment officer. That's where he teamed up with Mr.
Applegate.
   The two spun off their own firm in 1984 with three clients
and $40 million to manage. The vastly larger firm now has two
growth-stock portfolios: an "emerging growth" group of
companies with market value below $500 million (the median is
$193 million); and a larger, "growth equity" group with a
median capitalization of $1.6 billion. More than half the
stocks traded over-the-counter. Through the end of May, the
portfolio of the smaller stocks rose 7.9% and the other one
jumped 13.9%, compared with a 0.9% climb in the Nasdaq
Composite Index and a 3.7% rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.
   A 100% annual turnover rate isn't unusual for the 30 to 50
stocks in the two portfolios. With both portfolios usually
fully invested in stocks, their managers seek companies
growing 20% to 30% a year. The firm also does in-house
analysis of improvement in earnings or narrowing of losses.
Here's a sampling of the firm's holdings:
                                                                                                       

   Intel is an example where earnings momentum is crucial,
according to Jack C. Marshall, portfolio manager of the
larger, growth equity group. He bought some shares last year,
before the semiconductor maker reversed a string of quarterly
earnings declines. Despite some disappointments, Mr. Marshall
says he became convinced Intel's business was improving as it
became a dominant supplier for desktop computers. Longer
term, he expects the company to grow at an annual clip of 20%
or more.
                                                                                                       

   Medco Containment Services, a Fair Lawn, N.J., provider of
low-cost prescription drug programs to employer health plans,
attracted Mr. Marshall earlier this year with revenue growing
at about 40% annually.
                                                                                                       

   Costco Wholesale, a membership warehouse merchandiser, is
praised for being quick to close weak outlets in one market
even while it expands in another. "They don't ride a lot of
their poor stores very long," Mr. Marshall says.
   Nicholas-Applegate generally avoids owning more than four
days' average trading volume of a stock, to ensure that it
won't be stuck with too large a position. "But if we really
like a story and everything is coming through as we expected"
there may be some exceptions, says Catherine Avery, manager
of the emerging growth portfolio.
   Ms. Avery's picks span a number of sectors, in keeping
with the firm's "bottom-up" approach to picking stocks of
companies with strong individual merits. She partook of the
recent offering of K Swiss, a maker of casual footwear that
she expects to grow more than 20% a year.
                                                                                                       

   Oregon Steel was chosen before reporting improved earnings
but after it became clear that the company would be a
supplier of materials for two large natural gas pipelines
approved by federal regulators, says Ms. Avery. As the only
West Coast supplier for the pipelines, which will terminate
in California, Oregon Steel is in a good position, she notes.
The balance sheet is in "good shape."
                                                                                                       

   Novellus Systems of San Jose, Calif., with 55% gross
profit margins, easily fits the Nicholas-Applegate profile. A
designer and maker of equipment used in producing
semiconductors, Novellus is expected to announce two new
products later this year and plans to expand into Japan, Ms.
Avery says. She calls the balance sheet "clean," projecting
per-share earnings of about $2 in 1990 and $2.50 to $2.75 in
1991.
                                                                                                       

   Immunex is one of her favored biotechnology stocks. The
company is due to appear this month before a Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel for review of its GM-CSF, a
product that stimulates output of white blood cells. While
the panel will review the use of the product in treating
recipients of bone marrow transplants, she says there is
widespread anticipation that it might eventually be used for
other treatments.
