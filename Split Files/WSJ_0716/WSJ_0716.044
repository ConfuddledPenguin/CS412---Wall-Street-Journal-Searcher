   Five and a half months after its launch as the nation's
first sports-only daily newspaper, the National is still
wrestling with problems ranging from getting late scores into
its various editions to squelching rumors that star columnist
Mike Lupica is leaving.
   Yes, the National is doing something about the late
scores, and no, Mr. Lupica says, he isn't leaving. But it
remains uncertain whether the National can find a day-to-day
audience and continue to woo advertisers after charter
discounts expire.

   The problem of late scores was in the spotlight last week
with the National's coverage of the baseball All-Star Game. A
rain delay stretched the game out so that 30% of the press
run for the New York market, including some in the city
itself, had nothing on it. The cover of those papers showed
the New York Jets' new No. 1 draft choice, Rob Moore. In
contrast, all of USA Today's readers in New York got a
front-page report on the game.
   That wasn't the National's first such problem. Often the
paper has been unable to provide all of its readership with
late scores, particularly from West Coast games. Because it's
an all-sports publication, says editor Frank Deford, "people
have placed us on a standard nobody else was {held to}.
People expected all of our editions to have everything" in
terms of late scores. But thousands of copies meant for
readers in the East and Midwest were going to press too
early. That has made it appear that competitors -- notably
USA Today and major metropolitan newspapers -- were beating
the National at its own game.
   The partnership that owns the National, headed by
publisher Peter O. Price, says it has found a solution.
Starting July 9 in Chicago and New York, the paper started a
late final edition, which goes to press at 3:30 a.m. Eastern
time. This edition became possible only after the National
added enough printing sites and worked out distribution bugs,
Mr. Price says. The paper is distributed by Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
publisher of The Wall Street Journal.
   The new edition already has made a difference. Last
Wednesday, about 70% of the National's New York circulation
of 90,000 got a swinging Jose Canseco on the cover and five
pages on the All-Star Game, with the final score, inside.
Without the new edition, Mr. Price estimates, only about half
of New York readers would have had a story on the game.
   "We promised our readers we'd be the ultimate sports
paper, and with the new final edition, we've delivered," says
Mr. Price.
   Gannett Co.'s USA Today had some problems with its own
All-Star game coverage. Gene Policinski, managing
editor/sports for USA Today, says at least half of the
paper's 1.8 million nationwide circulation got a front page
photo of Julio Franco and several stories of the finished
game inside. Other readers got stories of the game in
progress. On most nights, two-thirds of USA Today's
circulation gets all final scores.
   The National is still grappling with another challenge:
differentiating itself from the competition, notably USA
Today's statistics-filled sports pages. Already, Mr. Price
and Mr. Deford have trashed some of the novel ideas that were
supposed to set the National apart. Gone is a weather map
with forecasts for sports-mad cities and a "Real World"
summary of non-sports news. The "Playground" page, full of
crossword and trivia games, has been cut back, as has
international coverage. Posed cover photographs and
illustrations have largely been dropped in favor of action
photos.
   The National continues to focus on next-day coverage of
professional games, but tries to set itself apart with a
gossip page and local columnists and a sprinkling of
magazine-length feature stories, such as a piece on Lynette
Woodard, the first woman to play for the Harlem
Globetrotters. Added to that formula has been a once-a-week
color photo essay, such as one last week on pastoral scenes
from the Tour de France bicycle race, and articles by a
three-person investigative team, including a look at how
sports agents take advantage of clients.
   The National already has spent at least $25 million on the
launch and will spend millions more on its expansion beyond
New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Mr. Price says the purse
strings haven't been tightened by his rich partner, Emilio
Azcarraga, who owns the Mexican media company Televisa, and
has said he will spend $100 million to see the National fly.
   Mr. Price denies reports that the National will abandon
local coverage in major cities, saying research and focus
groups indicate local fans buy it when they want more
coverage than their local paper provides. Mr. Deford says he
is hiring columnists who will anchor each local edition. A
San Diego edition started up in June, with San Francisco to
follow by the end of this month, Dallas in August, Detroit in
September, Boston in October and more later.
   Mr. Price says circulation ranges from 175,000 to 200,000,
with roughly 90,000 in New York, about 40,000 each in Chicago
and Los Angeles, and the rest in other markets. On most days,
the paper falls short of its six-month target of 200,000
readers. Mr. Price says the National expects to hit that
level consistently by fall. He also claims its readers
average 32 years of age and $45,000 in household income,
making them richer and younger than readers of most daily
newspapers' sports pages.
   Hungry to build readership, the National has reverted to
some time-honored gimmicks. Last month, it started a "Win It
All" sweepstakes offering "hundreds of fabulous prizes" in
hopes of boosting newsstand sales. In September, it will add
bulk distribution of daily copies to airlines and hotels, a
method USA Today also uses to reach the business traveler.
Bulk circulation means the airlines and hotels buy copies at
a discount and give them to customers for free.
   The National is expected to apply for a certified audit by
the Audit Bureau of Circulations early next year, which
should enable it to draw more national advertisers.
   "We are still waiting for proof," says Richard Weigand,
media director for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS-Pacific in Torrance,
Calif., whose Toyota Motor Sales client is a charter
advertiser in the National. "We wouldn't be in the National
if we didn't think it had a good chance. But the longer I
wait for the audit, the antsier I get."
   As for Mr. Lupica, the National's fiery columnist who was
wooed from the New York Daily News, he is staying put. He
admits, though, that it hasn't been easy. "I probably had a
more difficult period of adjustment because of my own
diminished readership in New York," Mr. Lupica says. "But as
we get more cities, it will get better. We are finally coming
out of our shakedown cruise."
