   NEW YORK -- Pay raises in the U.S. will outpace inflation
next year more than any time in the past three years, a
survey by the Conference Board found.
   The Conference Board, an independent business research
group, said pay increases for U.S. salaried workers will
average about 5% this year and are expected to rise to an
average of nearly 5.5% in 1991. The findings were made in the
board's annual private-sector salary survey, which covers 537
companies in various industries.

   The board's current projection for the rise in inflation
for 1991 is 4.5%, while pay increases for exempt employees
are expected to rise to 5.5%. Exempt employees are workers
such as salaried professionals and supervisors who are
excluded from overtime provisions of the federal wage and
salary laws.
   The report noted salary increases would be greatest in the
diversified services and insurance industries, with gains
averaging about 5.5% this year and 5.6% in 1991. Wholesale
and retail trade companies reported the lowest salary
increases, averaging 5% both this year and next. Average
increases for nonexecutive salaried workers in manufacturing
will be 5% in 1990 and slightly higher next year.
   Executives will receive slightly higher pay increases than
other salaried workers both this year and next, with
increases averaging 5.5%.
   Of the companies surveyed, 82% are using at least one
variable pay program, the board said. Eligibility for
variable compensation that once was mostly limited to
executive and sales personnel is now being extended to other
employee groups, the board said.
   The variable pay programs "provide an alternative to fixed
salary costs while enabling employers to foster, enhance and
reward various forms of achievement," said Elizabeth
Arreglado, Conference Board compensation specialist.
   The most popular form of variable pay is special cash
awards for outstanding individual contributions, which was
used by 38% of those polled. About 30% offer incentive pay
for employees who reach specific performance goals; 29% use
recognition programs; 27% have current pay profit-sharing
plans; 23% give lump-sum merit awards; 18% offer team
incentives; 11% have gain-sharing and skill-based pay
programs; and 6% have two-tier pay plans.
