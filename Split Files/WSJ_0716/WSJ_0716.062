   NEW YORK -- Corporate credit quality fell sharply in the
second quarter, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said.
   The rating concern, part of McGraw-Hill Inc., said it
lowered ratings on about $190 billion of debt in the quarter
and raised ratings on $34 billion. The number of downgrades,
207, greatly exceeded the 50 upgrades.

   Two large debt issuers, Ford Motor Credit Co. and Chrysler
Financial Corp., contributed heavily to the volume of
downgraded debt in the latest quarter. "In addition, non-U.S.
corporate rating changes were all negative," S&amp;P said. It
also noted bank holding companies had 23 downgrades but only
one upgrade.
   Separately, S&amp;P said municipal credit quality remained
weak in the second quarter, largely because of downgrades
among housing issues and ratings of National Rural Utilities
Cooperative Finance Corp.
   S&amp;P estimated that it lowered ratings on $14.5 billion of
municipal debt and raised ratings on $8.8 billion. Downgrades
totaled 139 in the quarter, and upgrades 45.
