   New York's Public Service Commission staff recommended
that Nynex Corp.'s New York Telephone Co. unit reduce its
current rates by $81 million, rejecting the company's
proposed $919.7 million increase for next year.
   In a letter to the full commission, the staff said the
telephone-company unit of the New York-based
telecommunications concern had understated its 1991 revenue
forecast, failed to account properly for certain deregulated
operations' costs and improperly included excessive central
office equipment-removal costs.

   As an example, the staff said certain deregulated ventures
of the telephone company were charged to its regulated
operations, "thus inflating its need for rate relief."
   New York Telephone, in a statement issued Friday, said it
will file a rebuttal in about 11 days that will "demonstrate
that the trial staff's recommendations are grossly
inappropriate."
   "We're disappointed," said Robert T. Anderson, New York
Telephone's managing director of regulatory planning. "We'll
deal with the commission's allegations one at a time."
   A final ruling by the commission is expected in December.
   The staff previously rejected a $445 million
rate-settlement plan proposed by the company in early March.
Shortly afterward, the telephone unit presented the staff
with a proposal for a $965 million rate increase and for
subsequent increases over the next two years resulting in a
total boost of $1.4 billion for the three years.
   "This is not the first time the staff has suggested a
reduction," a spokesman for New York Telephone said. In 1985,
the company sought a $669 million rate increase. The PSC
staff recommended instead a $1.9 million rate reduction. New
York Telephone eventually got a $226 million increase.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Nynex
closed at $78 a share, down 62.5 cents.
   Separately, a federal appeals court in Washington handed
Nynex a victory, but one that carries the risk of further
public examination of transactions at Nynex's purchasing arm,
Materiel Enterprises.
   An appeals court panel sent back to Judge Harold Greene a
Nynex request for a waiver from the consent decree that broke
up the Bell System. The company sought the waiver to allow
Materiel Enterprises to sell telecommunications equipment to
companies and other organizations outside the Nynex family.
Judge Greene, who oversees the consent decree, rejected the
Nynex request in 1987.
   The appeals court panel said that Nynex presented a
"powerful argument for granting the waiver." The company and
the Department of Justice, which recommended granting the
waiver, argued that thousands of companies already distribute
telecommunications gear in an intensely competitive market.
   Nynex said it was pleased with the decision and awaits the
remand proceeding in which the waiver request will be
reconsidered. In March, the company announced that Materiel
Enterprises and its System Marketing unit would become units
of the phone companies rather than remain separate
subsidiaries. The announcement was made after the Federal
Communications Commission proposed a record $1.4 million fine
for $118.5 million in overcharges on goods and services that
Materiel Enterprises sold to Nynex phone companies. Details
of the changes haven't been worked out yet.
   The proposed fine and allegations of improper activities
involving Materiel Enterprises employees and suppliers are
certain to get a full airing in the remand proceeding as
opponents of Nynex's plans try to demonstrate what they say
is a tendency by the company to engage in anti-competitive
acts.
