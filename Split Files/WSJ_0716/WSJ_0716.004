   CHICAGO -- Wells-Gardner Electronics Corp., benefiting
from improved product mix, stronger demand and lower costs
for materials, expects to report second-quarter per-share
earnings climbed to a range of 19 cents to 23 cents, said the
company's chairman, chief executive officer and president,
Frank J. Myers.
   Getting a boost from both a big tax credit and the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, the maker of electronic products
expects to post net between $715,000 to $865,000. Net will
include a tax credit of between $265,000 to $340,000, which
will contribute about 7 cents to 9 cents a share.

   Those earnings would mark a sharp increase from the
year-ago net of just $1,000, or less than a penny a share;
the earlier period's results were hurt by a $107,000 loss
from discontinued operations.
   Sales in the latest period, Mr. Myers said in an
interview, will be up 61%, to about $14.5 million, from $9
million in the year-ago period when results reflected a soft
export market and higher costs for materials.
   Mr. Myers attributed Wells-Gardner's substantial sales
increase primarily to "greater demand" for the company's
large screen video monitors. Also contributing to the
increase is what he called the "outstanding performance" of
the video game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the success of
which has boosted demand for the company's video monitors.
   Early this year, the company re-entered the color
television business under a private-label contract with
Majestic Industries Inc., Mr. Myers said. The TV business is
expected to contribute about $10 million to annual sales. He
said the purpose of getting back into the television business
is its ability to make contributions to earnings and to help
the company put excess capacity to work.
   The re-entry followed the company's earlier
discontinuation of its switching power supply line and its
touch-screen panel operation in a move to concentrate on
video operations. Mr. Myers said the company's future focus
will be on moves designed to "improve efficiency."
   He said the company expects a "substantial increase" in
sales and at least break-even earnings in the third quarter
ending September 30.
   Mr. Myers concluded by saying, "Wells remains strong with
no debt" and is "positioned for profitable growth."
