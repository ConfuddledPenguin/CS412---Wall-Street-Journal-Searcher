   MADRID -- Spanish car sales plummeted 21% in June to
91,818 cars from 115,618 cars a year earlier, the Spanish
Association of Car Makers said.
   The result brought sales in the year's first six months to
542,184 cars, down 8.7% from 593,801 cars a year earlier.

   The drop in June sales exceeded even the most pessimistic
projections, which anticipated a 16% decline.
   The association said Spain's tight credit restrictions,
coupled with a value-added tax of 33%, has hit auto sales
hard.
