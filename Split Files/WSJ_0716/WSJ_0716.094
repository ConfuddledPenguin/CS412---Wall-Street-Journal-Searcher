   Federal bank regulators closed Permanent Savings Bank,
Niagara Falls, N.Y., and sold its deposits to Key Bank of
Western New York National Association.
   Under the terms of the transaction, Key Bank, of Buffalo,
N.Y., will assume $319 million of Permanent's deposits, and
will purchase $321.7 million in assets at a discount of
$499,000.
