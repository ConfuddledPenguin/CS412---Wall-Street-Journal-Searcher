   INITIAL OFFERINGS may increase at an even faster pace in
coming months.
   Some 132 companies went public during the first six months
of 1990, raising $6.9 billion, according to IDD Information
Services, a New York securities data concern. That's 28% more
offerings pulling in 16% more money than in the same period
last year, when 103 companies raised $5.9 billion. Some
investment bankers predict even sharper increases in the
second half of this year.

   Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco investment
bank, says it took five companies public in this year's first
half and already has plans to take eight more public in the
next three months. The recent strength of the stock market
has persuaded many investors to return to equities and the
stocks of small, emerging-growth companies, says Sanford
Robertson, managing partner. Investors, who last flocked to
new issues in 1983, once again are "looking to new stock
offerings as a major investment vehicle," he adds.
   The speculative companies that often signal the end of a
new issues market have yet to appear, says John Michaelson, a
managing director of Needham &amp; Co., a New York investment
banking firm. "It's still a selective market for going
public." Most of the companies that are going public already
have well-established businesses and strong managers, he
adds.
   The market for new issues also has benefited from the
strong market performance of many new issues recently.
Hologic Inc., a Waltham, Mass., maker of diagnostic X-ray
systems, was one of the star performers. Hologic shares,
which were first traded at $14 on March 1, have more than
doubled to $29.25.

   SMALL U.S. FIRMS in low-tech businesses are finding new
money in Japan.
   Although Japanese investments in high-technology U.S.
businesses have won the most attention, less glamorous
companies are getting some money, too. Chicago's MASI Ltd.,
which recently launched a joint investment banking venture
with Tokyo's Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co., says it recently
raised $45 million for two U.S. companies in mature
manufacturing businesses. One is a $30 million Illinois-based
rubber goods maker; the other a $70 million Iowa-based
machine tools company. Japanese corporate and individual
investors bought the shares in the two firms.
   Such companies often have a difficult time obtaining
financing from U.S. sources. But Japanese investors like them
because their shares are lower priced than shares in
comparable Japanese concerns, says Jack Campbell, a MASI
principal. The Japanese investors "want to put their money in
companies that do business in a predictable economic
climate," he adds.
   European investors also are looking to finance some mature
manufacturing companies here, says Chet Borgida, a partner at
Grant Thornton, New York. "Many of these investors are
risk-averse and looking for the stability that these
companies provide."

   PUBLICLY HELD TECH firms say private capital is getting
easier to find.
   Last December, Centocor Inc. raised $13 million entirely
from private investors, including Canaan Partners, Bessemer
Venture Partners and Morgan Capital Corp. Another
biotechnology concern, Enzon Inc., raised about $25 million
from private investors. Investors received new preferred
shares in the company and interest-bearing convertible stock.
   "Private markets offer companies access to investors that
often aren't interested in their public stock at that time,"
says Michael Goldberg of Montauk Capital, a New York
investment banker. For small companies out of favor with
public investors, "it's also less risky than trying to go the
public route," he adds.
   Private investors like these deals because the stock
they're purchasing is priced lower than the public stock. The
yields from these investments can be higher than many venture
capital deals, says Jeffrey Jay of Canaan Partners, a
Rowayton, Conn., venture capital firm. The value of Canaan's
investment in Centocor, for example, has increased fourfold
over an eight-month period.
   The financings also benefit existing shareholders because
the new capital allows firms to continue necessary research
without hurting profits.
   Dr. Goldberg, who currently is working on three private
placements for small public companies in health care, says
the number of such deals will increase. "It allows both the
company and the investor to be flexible in their financing.
And it turns out profitable for both," he says.

   THE TROUBLE AT U.S. THRIFTS has franchise owners
scrambling for capital.
   Franchise owners, who received much of the financing for
their businesses from savings and loan institutions and
commercial banks, are finding these institutions reluctant to
lend them money lately. The institutions and their regulators
often consider the loans, usually used to finance real estate
purchases and building construction, too risky.
   Bankers have tightened lending standards for franchise
owners, says Pat Boroian, president of Francorp Inc., a
consultant based in Chicago. As their assets have shrunk,
these lenders are under increasing pressure from regulators
to reduce new loans to franchises, he adds.
   A Minnesota bank, which last year received authorization
to lend as much as $200 million to franchises, has pulled the
plug on its program, Mr. Boroian says.
   In the last six months, applications from franchise owners
for financing have risen 10% at Franchise Finance Corp. of
America, one of the largest U.S. providers of capital to
franchises. Many of the new applicants are those that can't
get money from the S&amp;Ls, says Morton Fleischer, founder of
Franchise Finance. The Scottsdale, Ariz., company recently
raised $1.2 billion to finance real estate purchases by
owners of fast food franchises and truck stops.
