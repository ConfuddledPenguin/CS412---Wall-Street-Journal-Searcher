   Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein, a well-regarded San
Francisco agency that has long been trying to springboard
into the national limelight, may have finally succeeded.
Today, it is expected to be named to handle Heublein's $12
million to $15 million account.
   Industry executives say Goodby has been tapped to create
ads for Finlandia vodka and Jose Cuervo tequila, among other
brands. The win would finally give Goodby the national
platform it has been searching for. The seven-year-old agency
has built up one of the strongest creative reputations in the
ad business, but it hasn't had the kind of showcase national
accounts agencies need to break into the big leagues.
Executives at Goodby, which currently bills about $50
million, declined to comment. Heublein executives couldn't be
reached.

   Goodby would succeed giant Young &amp; Rubicam, whose Heublein
campaigns included visual puns such as an ad headlined
"Finnish line" picturing a row of Finlandia bottles. In
winning the prestigious liquor business, Goodby also
leapfrogged several other big East Coast players, including
Lintas and McCann-Erickson, which handles Heublein's Smirnoff
brand. The Heublein account would immediately become Goodby's
largest.
   Heublein also is expected to name another small shop on a
hot streak, Waring &amp; LaRosa of New York, to handle its
Christian Brothers brandy account, with billings of about $3
million. Charlie Traynor, a Heublein vice president of
marketing who handles the Christian Brothers label, confirmed
that assignment. "They're a very solid marketing-oriented
agency with a good creative record," he said, adding that
Waring's whimsical Perrier work -- it created the animated
"World's First Soft Drink" campaign -- "was one of our
reasons to select them as an agency for consideration."
   Goodby had handled the Christian Brothers campaign until
last year, when Heublein bought the brand and switched it to
Young &amp; Rubicam. Goodby had created some eye-catching ads
that also used visual puns, such as one picturing singer
Chuck Berry dressed in orange with the headline, "CB and
orange." Now, Goodby will have a chance to try out its ideas
on a larger scale.
   Goodby has a chance at following several other regional
agencies that broke onto the national arena. Hal Riney &amp;
Partners, the agency behind General Motors' Saturn launch,
Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and the old Gallo and Perrier
commercials, also started as a small San Francisco shop. In
fact, two of Goodby's three principals worked for Mr. Riney,
then the head of Ogilvy's San Francisco office, before
splitting off to form Goodby.
   Goodby's largest accounts had been the Royal Viking cruise
line business and the H.J. Heinz pet food account. A current
Heinz spot spoofs taste tests with a man-on-the-street
interviewer asking people to choose between two dog foods,
one of which is Heinz's Skippy brand.
   The clients that drew accolades in the ad business,
though, were small regional and local accounts, including the
University of California at San Francisco and the San
Franciso Examiner. Those eye-catching campaigns prompted
Advertising Age, the trade magazine, to name Goodby its
"agency of the year" for 1990. The only missing element, the
magazine said at the time, was "a high-profile national
account." Goodby has been trying -- before and since -- to
fill in the gap.

   Shifts at Margeotes
                                                                                                       

   Less than a year after awarding its $4 million account to
Margeotes Fertitta &amp; Weiss, Haagen-Dazs pulled its account
from the New York shop and put it back into review.
   Yves E. Coleon, Haagen-Dazs's vice president of marketing,
said a conflict had developed with Margeotes's handling of
the Godiva account. Godiva, which sells ice cream in some of
its stores, has been a client at Margeotes for 14 years.
   Mr. Coleon wouldn't say why it was that Haagen-Dazs didn't
determine Godiva to be a conflict when it first selected
Margeotes last August. He would say only that "the
sensitivity of the conflict was becoming more acute."
   He said the Grand Metropolitan PLC unit would hear pitches
from a number of different agencies for the account, with a
decision expected by September.
   Separately, Margeotes said it was assigned the ad account
for Commodore International's new CDTV system. Billings
weren't disclosed.

   HOTEL REVIEW: Best Western International, Phoenix, Ariz.,
put its $10 million ad account up for review. A spokeswoman
for the hotel chain said Thomas-Tvert, the small Phoenix shop
that currently handles the account, will participate in the
review along with a number of other ad agencies. The
spokeswoman said the review had been called simply to
"evaluate available creative opportunities."
