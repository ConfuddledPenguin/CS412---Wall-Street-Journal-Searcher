   Southeast Banking Corp., Miami, reported a second-quarter
net loss of $20.7 million, or 66 cents a share, reflecting a
previously announced surge in nonperforming assets.
   Southeast had net income of $32.3 million, or $1 a share,
a year earlier.

   In mid-June, Southeast said it expected to report a
second-quarter loss because of the worsening condition of the
Florida real-estate market. In line with that expectation,
the banking company said nonperforming assets rose to $619
million as of June 30, from $474 million at March 31. The
reserve for loan losses was boosted to $279 million, or 2.73%
of loans, from $258 million at the end of March.
   Nonperforming assets are loans that have been foreclosed
or are more than 90 days past due. Loan-loss reserves are a
fund that banks set aside to offset expected losses from bad
loans.
   For the first half, Southeast reported a loss of $77.5
million, or $2.41 a share, compared with earnings of $65.4
million, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier.
