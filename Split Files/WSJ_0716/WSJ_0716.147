   Cambrex Corp., a specialty chemical maker based in East
Rutherford, N.J., said it intends to become the majority
partner in a joint venture that would acquire part of the
textile-chemical business of American Cyanamid Co., a Wayne,
N.J., maker of chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
   The parties declined to disclose terms of the proposed
transaction. But Cambrex said the operations to be acquired
include Cyanamid's textile-chemical plant in Charlotte, N.C.,
and have annual sales exceeding $20 million. The deal is
subject to a definitive pact, board approvals and other
conditions. Cyanamid confirmed that the transaction outlined
by Cambrex is under negotiation, but it declined to say why
it would sell the textile-chemical operations.

   Cambrex's minority partner in the venture would be an
investor group led by L. David Moore, an executive most
recently with Interchem Inc., then an Atlanta unit of RTZ
Corp., London. Reached in Atlanta, Mr. Moore said he left
Interchem as president last October, shortly after it was
acquired by Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France.
