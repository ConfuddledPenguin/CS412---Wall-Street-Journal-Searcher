   BRUSSELS -- Italy asked the European Community Friday to
launch a broad debate with the U.S. and Japan on global
energy issues, including a discussion on imposing taxes on
energy consumption.
   In a report, the Italian government said the "rapid
growth" in global energy use demands a concerted
international effort to cut consumption, save energy and
promote renewable sources of it.

   "All these actions . . . need to be international with the
more industrialized countries taking the lead so as to
prevent serious consequences for the world economy," the
report said.
   The report assesses global energy output and consumption
trends. It will be discussed at a meeting in Rome today by
ministers responsible for energy matters of the 12 EC
nations.
   The energy document said the EC's energy goals until 1995,
drafted in 1985, are outdated because oil prices have dropped
sharply since then, and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl
shattered confidence in nuclear power.
   "However, the most important reason for rethinking all
energy matters is the concern over the environment that has
arisen in recent years and specifically the fear of a global
warming of our planet due to the action of greenhouse gases,"
the report said.
