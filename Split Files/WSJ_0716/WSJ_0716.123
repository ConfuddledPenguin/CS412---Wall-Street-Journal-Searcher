   BURLINGTON, Mass. -- Semicon Inc., citing declining sales,
said it won't be able to pay interest on its debt and may
file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, unless agreements can be worked out
with them.
   The semiconductor devices maker said it is holding
discussions with its banks and debenture trustee. A company
spokesman characterized talks as optimistic.

   For the year ended June 30, 1989, Semicon had net income
of $1.6 million, or 50 cents a share, on sales of $15.5
million. However, Semicon said, because of the continuing
recession in the semiconductor industry, its annual revenue
has shrunk to about $10 million.
   With sales at that level, the company said it has enough
money only to run the business in fiscal 1991, and not to
meet its debt service obligations.
   Semicon said it missed a $268,125 semiannual interest
payment due July 15 on its 13% convertible subordinated
debentures. The company said it is seeking to restructure its
debt, adding that unless it can reduce debt expense
significantly, it won't be able to continue as a viable
company.
   Semicon said it plans to release financial results late
next month.
