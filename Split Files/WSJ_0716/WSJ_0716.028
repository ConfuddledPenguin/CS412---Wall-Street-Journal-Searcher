   NEW YORK -- David A. Halperin, executive vice president of
the New York Mercantile Exchange, has accepted an offer to
become president of the Commodity Exchange, a person familiar
with the two exchanges said.
   Mr. Halperin declined to comment on his new job, pending a
meeting of the Comex board Wednesday. The board is expected
to vote on the appointment at that time.

   The Comex is the nation's largest gold, silver and copper
futures exchange. But it is a distant fourth in size behind
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
and the New York Merc.
   Mr. Halperin's stay at the Merc was short-lived, having
moved there last December 1989 from the position of executive
vice president at the Comex. Mr. Halperin took the job at the
Merc as part of the Merc board's reorganization plan for the
exchange.
   A senior official at the Merc said that the 47-year-old
Mr. Halperin will be missed, calling him "a top-flight
administrator."
   One Merc administrator thinks Mr. Halperin's departure
might be a roadblock in the current attempt to merge the
Comex and the Merc, New York's largest commodity exchange. He
noted that Mr. Halperin was a part of the core group at the
Merc who were privy to its negotiating positions in the
merger talks.
   Exchange officials have indicated that within a month or
so the discussions were expected to produce one or more
merger plans that would be presented to the members of both
exchanges for a vote.
   The last president of the Comex, Arnold Staloff, a former
senior official at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, was
brought in with considerable fanfare in August 1989. He
resigned May 1. Some say Mr. Staloff's resignation was due to
the highly charged political atmosphere of the exchange. Mr.
Halperin, having worked at the Comex for eight years, is
likely to be familiar with the environment.
   Before Mr. Staloff took the Comex presidency it was widely
believed that Mr. Halperin was a candidate for the job. Four
months after Mr. Staloff took office, Mr. Halperin left the
Comex to take the Merc position.
   Before becoming executive vice president at the Comex, Mr.
Halperin was senior vice president in the areas of finance,
administration and development. He is a certified public
accountant and, prior to joining Comex, worked as controller
of Columbia University and as an audit supervisor for Coopers
&amp; Lybrand.
