   By describing Friday's credit-easing move as a technical
matter, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has
signaled that further moves to cut interest rates shouldn't
be expected soon.
   The Fed took action that resulted in a modest cut in the
so-called federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge
on loans to each other. That move, which caused the rate to
drop to just over 8% from its previous level of 8 1/4%, could
cause other short-term interest rates to fall as well.

   The Fed's rate-cutting move came after a week of seemingly
contradictory pronouncements by the Fed chairman.
   In a private meeting with senators last week, Mr.
Greenspan argued that because the civilian jobless rate had
fallen to 5.2%, the Fed had little room to stimulate the
economy without sparking inflation.
   Then, in congressional testimony on Thursday, Mr.
Greenspan made the unusual announcement that the Fed might
ease modestly, not to help a sluggish economy but rather to
"offset" any effect of the credit crunch on bank-loan rates.
   The message behind those confusing statements: The Fed's
easing move should be viewed as a one-time correction and not
as the first of a series of easing moves.
   The Fed's action comes after weeks of intensifying
pressure from the Bush administration to cut rates. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady had even taken the unusual step of
complaining publicly about interest rates in a series of
recent interviews.
   Administration officials were pleased with the Fed's
action Friday. But they also understood that the Fed chairman
was doing so grudgingly. "There is a consistent pattern of
lagging" at the Fed, one official said. "This is better than
nothing, but it's late and insufficient."
   In any event, the Fed's move should ease the pressure Mr.
Greenspan will feel Wednesday, when he is scheduled to give
Congress his mid-year review of monetary policy.
   On Wall Street, the Fed's action was seen partly in a
political context. The move "certainly doesn't hurt
politically," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at
Chase Manhattan Bank. "It takes some of the pressure off the
Fed and alleviates some of the criticism . . . regarding Fed
restrictiveness."
   Despite Mr. Greenspan's elaborate qualifications, Mr. Fine
believes the Fed will have to take more rate-cutting action
this year. "I think further ease will come, but not for a
while, not until they see definitive evidence of a
sustainable moderation in inflation," he said.
   The credit-easing move had a calming effect on long-term
interest rates, which fell slightly after the Fed's action.
Nevertheless, some investment managers fear the Fed may be
easing too soon. "I think the Fed is a little premature" in
easing credit now, said Wayne F. Wong, managing director at
Marinvest Inc., a money-management firm based in New York.
"The faster you ease, the sooner inflation will come back."
   In explaining his plans to ease credit, Mr. Greenspan
cited bank data showing that rates banks charge on loans have
risen slightly relative to the federal funds rate. He also
noted that growth in the nation's money supply has been
sluggish recently. According to Fed sources, Mr. Greenspan's
conclusions were drawn partly from banking data that weren't
readily available to the public.
