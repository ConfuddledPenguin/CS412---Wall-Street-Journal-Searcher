   NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve's unexpectedly rapid
credit easing could undermine the feeble dollar, some
currency analysts say.
   While the Fed isn't expected to lower rates by much, it is
loosening at a time when central banks in other major
industrial nations are keeping their policies steady.

   Foreign exchange dealings have been what's known as an
interest-rate play recently, with the currencies of nations
with the highest rates drawing the most buyers.
   The dollar, one of the market's weakest performers, is
expected to remain a laggard.
   "I don't expect it to go zooming down," but the dollar has
room to fall a little more, says Carol Callanan, a corporate
foreign exchange adviser at Credit Lyonnais in New York. Last
week's intraday dollar low of 1.6310 marks was the lowest
level since mid-May, and the intraday nadir of 146.75 yen was
the lowest since late February.
   Late Friday here, the dollar traded at 1.6510 marks and
148.15 yen, up from 1.6340 marks and 147.30 yen late
Thursday. Compared with its week-earlier levels, the dollar
was just about unchanged against the mark but down 2.3%
against the yen.
   At midmorning on Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading
at 148.10 yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 147.42 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6575 marks, up
from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6417 marks.
   The dollar rose Friday even though economists say the Fed
sent the financial markets a clear sign that it was easing,
the first policy adjustment in six months despite frequent
Bush administration pleas for lower rates. Traders say the
dollar rebounded because it fell too far too fast Thursday,
when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan disclosed that easing was on
the way. When the Fed arranged weekend system repurchase
agreements Friday morning, it aggressively poured reserves
into the banking system.
   Many economists say the federal funds rate is moving down
to 8% from the 8 1/4% that had been the norm since December.
The federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge one
another on overnight loans, is carefully steered by the Fed
to control the banking system.
   The Fed has "definitely eased," says Chris Rupkey, an
economist at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. He called it "fairly
certain" the the federal funds rate now will average 8%.
   The impact of lower U.S. rates may begin to sink in soon,
some currency analysts warn.
   Easier credit in the U.S. means more bad news for the
dollar in the area of interest rate differentials.
   In the Eurocurrency market, three-month Eurodollar
deposits currently yield 8.19%, less than 8.25% for
three-month Euromark deposits and roughly 15% on three-month
Eurosterling deposits.
   The dollar still has an interest rate advantage over the
yen, with three-month Euroyen deposits yielding only 7.63%.
However, the differential has narrowed substantially
recently, and it may shrink more if speculation about likely
Bank of Japan tightening is borne out.
   One saving grace for the dollar is the belief that the Fed
won't let the federal funds rate fall any more than 1/4 of a
percentage point at this time, currency analysts say.
   The Fed chairman made it clear Thursday that any easing
would be for the sake of the strained banking system rather
than the limp economy. U.S. economic data released Friday
indicate that consumer demand remains lackluster while
inflation is still a problem. Retail sales rose 0.5% in June,
but some economists weren't very impressed with the gain
because it followed deep declines in prior months.
   The producer price index increased 0.2% last month after
increasing 0.3% in May. Excluding the volatile food and
energy sections, producer prices were up an unexpectedly
large 0.6%.
   Mr. Greenspan's thoughts about the economy will become
clearer after he gives his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins
monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee
Wednesday. "We'll probably see some slight {dollar} rebound"
if Mr. Greenspan confirms that Fed easing will be limited,
says Steven Wood, director of financial markets research at
Bank of America in San Francisco. But he said lower U.S.
interest rates probably will keep the dollar under pressure
for the rest of the year.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery jumped $6.30 to $364.40 an ounce in very
heavy trading. Estimated volume was seven million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
about $364 an ounce.
