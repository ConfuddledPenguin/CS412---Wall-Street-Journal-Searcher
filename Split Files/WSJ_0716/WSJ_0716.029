   McCormick &amp; Co. is "on target" for meeting its fiscal 1990
goal of about $1.31 a share in operating earnings, Bailey A.
Thomas, president and chief operating officer, said.
   Including a one-time gain of $6.3 million, or 15 cents a
share, from the sale of land, that target suggests net income
for the year of about $1.46 a share, or about $61 million.

   For the year ended Nov. 30, the Hunt Valley, Md.,
specialty foods company posted earnings from continuing
operations of $52.5 million, or $1.20 a share, including a
gain on the sale of Brazilian operations of about six cents a
share. A one-time gain on sale of real estate made net to
$135.5 million, or $3.09 a share.
   McCormick hopes to maintain its projected 15% growth rate
in per-share operating earnings for the next several years,
Mr. Thomas said in an interview. Key elements of that
strategy include a push to develop microwave seasonings for
the U.S. market and expansion of the company's international
business, particularly in Europe.
   Within the U.S., Mr. Thomas said, McCormick is committed
to using technology to increase its 40% share of the consumer
spice and seasoning market. The company's successful switch
from metal to plastic packaging, launched in 1987, is
complete, and the research department is now working on
microwave seasonings.
   Because microwave cooking times are so short, many
seasonings don't fully permeate the food. "The development of
a flavor in any form comes from the process of cooking," Mr.
Thomas said. "The longer you cook food, the stronger the
flavor."
   To lick the problem of microwave blandness, McCormick is
working on a "secret" process to create seasoning blends that
release their flavor much more quickly. "When you put it in
your microwave, it will taste like you cooked it for 45
minutes or even three hours," Mr. Thomas said. Over the next
few years, McCormick plans to introduce improved spices to
both consumers and food processors.
   International operations, primarily in Mexico and the
U.K., accounted for nearly a third of McCormick's $1.2
billion in sales in fiscal 1989. But the opening of Western
Europe's economic borders in 1992 offers greater
opportunities for McCormick to expand its foreign business,
Mr. Thomas said.
   "Many companies are asking us to assist them as they
expand overseas," Mr. Thomas said. Such big U.S. industrial
customers as McDonald's and Burger King in the fast-food area
and Kraft General Foods in food processing are asking
McCormick to build facilities overseas to serve their needs.
   McCormick would also like to tap more of the consumer
spice and seasoning markets in continental Europe.
Unfortunately, Mr. Thomas said, "the world isn't waiting for
McCormick to enter their spice markets," so the company will
probably have to acquire a local spice firm.
   "We won't pay a ridiculously high price," Mr. Thomas said.
"But we may be forced to pay in order to get an initial
presence on the continent."
   To keep current and future spice processing plants
adequately supplied, McCormick is also implementing a "global
sourcing" plan, he said. Working in partnership with native
growers and traders in such countries as Brazil, Turkey and
China, McCormick is trying to minimize the traditional price
volatility in commodity spices through steady supplier
relationships.
   "What we bring to the venture is the marketing and
technology," Mr. Thomas said. "What our joint-venture partner
brings is knowledge of the market," especially the local
political situation. Both partners benefit from the stable
price and long-term selling relationship.
   Because of such partnerships with suppliers in Israel,
Egypt, Morocco and the U.S., McCormick no longer has to buy a
six-month supply of basil and store it until it can be used,
Mr. Thomas said. "We get it as we need it."
