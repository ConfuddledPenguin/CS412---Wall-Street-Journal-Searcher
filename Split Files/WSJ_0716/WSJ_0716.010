   Howtek Inc., citing increased orders and sales of its
color-printing systems, expects to report a profitable second
quarter and predicts sharp sales and earnings growth through
1991.
   In an interview, Howtek President David Bothwell said the
company's second-quarter net income was about $400,000, or
five cents a share, on sales of $5.8 million. Mr. Bothwell
said he was "comfortable" with a recent analyst's estimate
that Howtek, of Hudson, N.H., will earn 75 cents a share this
year and $2 a share in 1991. He said he expects sales of $30
million this year, up from last year's $18.4 million, and he
estimated a "conservative" $48 million sales figure for 1991.

   Accounting isn't completed for the 1990 second quarter,
and Mr. Bothwell said sales and earnings could both be "a
little higher" than his projections when final results are
reported next week. In last year's second quarter, Howtek
posted a loss of $1.7 million on revenue of $4.5 million. The
company hasn't had a profitable year since it started in
1984. Its stock has been a controversial investment.
   Short sales of Howtek on the American Stock Exchange rose
969,937 shares in June, amid concerns about heavy competition
and the failure of past positive announcements to translate
into earnings. Past analysts' estimates have also proved
greatly over-optimistic. The Howtek short position was equal
to 107 times daily trading in the previous month, vs. the
average Amex stock's short ratio of 23% of daily volume.
   Mr. Bothwell declined to discuss the short position. He
attributed a recent price rise in the company's shares to
discussions with analysts in which the company has disclosed
its positive outlook. Howtek's shares, which traded as high
as $27 since going public in 1984, have risen to $13.75
apiece from a low of $9.375 last month. Trading volume has
also picked up sharply.
   "Howtek is now stepping out and telling its story," Mr.
Bothwell said. During a "transition year" of product
diversification, he added, "we were very quiet. Now we've
turned the corner. This will be our third consecutive
profitable quarter."
   Howtek reported net of one cent a share in the last
quarter of 1989, and two cents a share in the first quarter
of 1990.
   Mr. Bothwell said Howtek is benefiting from its newer
product lines and greater reliance on higher-margin
proprietary products. He said the company's Colorscan system,
used in the color printing of newspapers and magazines, has
become its fastest-growing area. The company's earliest
products were color printers and scanners that attempted to
aid desktop publishing in the office.
   In the second quarter, Mr. Bothwell said, Howtek shipped
and installed 14 Colorscan systems, priced at between
$150,000 and $300,000. Contract closings on 11 of those
systems took place at an American Newspaper Publishers
Association meeting in Las Vegas, Nev., last month, he said.
In 1989's second quarter, Howtek sold and installed two
Colorscan systems.
   Orders for a new printer and scanner designed for use with
personal computers have "exceeded our business plan
requirements," Mr. Bothwell said. "The interest in both
products is extremely high." He declined to give figures on
orders for the printer, which retails for $2,995, or the
scanner, which lists at $1,995. Both products are computer
peripherals and were unveiled at a trade show in April.
   Because of Colorscan and the initial reaction to the
color-printing peripherals, "we're comfortable forecasting a
60% to 70% growth rate" in sales over the next two years, Mr.
Bothwell said.
   Heavy expenses for marketing, and the acquisition of
inventory to meet orders and projected future demand, means
cash flow wasn't positive in the second quarter, Mr. Bothwell
said, despite the expected net of five cents. He said he
expected cash flow to turn positive in the third quarter.
   Asked about an accounting dispute reported in Howtek's
recent proxy statement, Mr. Bothwell said the company has put
the problem behind it. According to the proxy statement and
Mr. Bothwell, Howtek's board dismissed Deloitte in May 1989
after the accountants questioned certain accounting
practices.
