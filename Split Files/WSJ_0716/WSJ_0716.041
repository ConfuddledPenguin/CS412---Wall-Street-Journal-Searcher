   As a white South African with an M.A. in political
science, I would like to respond to your June 19 editorial
"Mr. Mandela's Friends." America's reception of Nelson
Mandela has been magnificent, but also, I fear, fatally
flawed. Americans forget that when Mr. Mandela left prison he
discarded more than his shackles. Sloughed off too was his
infallibility, a purity bred of 27 years in living martyrdom.
And speaking his first post-prison words into a microphone in
Cape Town, he willingly embraced a new and far more potent
role -- that of politician.
   This is being forgotten in his American deification, and
the oversight could prove costly. When a politician is given
adulation to the degree Mr. Mandela is receiving, an
abridgment of the political dynamic occurs: No longer are the
political hustings the field upon which a man is measured;
instead, in Mount Sinai-like fashion, pronouncements become
invested with a value that is more a product of their lofty
origin than their critical content.

   It might also be prudent for Americans to consider the
effect their welcome is having on the rest of South Africa,
and especially on the white community. By according Mr.
Mandela statesman-like recognition, the inference to white
South Africa is tacit: You have been discounted. You may have
de jure standing, but de facto we'd rather speak to Mr.
Mandela. We'll let you know what we decide next week.
   And this is a big mistake. No meaningful settlement will
ever grace South Africa unless all parties are involved. And
if you alienate the most powerful of these -- the whites --
you will find South Africa an impossibly difficult equation.
   Nelson Mandela may well be the answer, but let him do the
proving. In the game that is South Africa he remains a player
-- not a referee.

   Mr. Mandela's visit understandably generated much
attention and discussion. The effervescent, but respectful
acclaim he received came from all points on the demographic
spectrum with few exceptions. The breadth and intensity of
his enthusiastic reception by Americans transcend the
increasingly general acceptance of the urgent causes he
espoused.
   Why? Why this uncommon, public adulation -- even from some
individuals who had not been especially concerned about
apartheid, or sanctions, or politics, or civil rights in
South Africa? It's because we were in the presence of a
phenomenon.
   Here before us (either at public gatherings or on live TV)
was a political leader who passionately believes in a cause,
who spoke directly, reasonably, unambiguously, forcefully and
tactfully. He said what he believed; and, because of how he
expressed himself, many believed what he said.
   For too long in the U.S. we have endured (and encouraged)
politicians on national, state and local levels who tell us
what they perceive the public wants to hear. We tolerate
incumbents and candidates who avoid tackling the many
problems existing in our society and who prefer to occupy
themselves -- and us -- with fluff and puff. Rather than
confronting reality, our politicians seem to recoil from it.
   The criteria for a successful political speech, or TV spot
announcement, continue to be: 1) Say nothing, but appear to
say something; 2) don't offend or antagonize anyone; 3) play
upon people's emotions and feelings; and 4) collect campaign
contributions so that you can buy more TV time in which you:
1) Say nothing, but appear to say something; 2) don't offend
or antagonize anyone; 3) play upon people's emotions and
feelings -- and, of course, 4) collect campaign contributions
so you can buy more TV time.
   Is it any wonder that fewer and fewer Americans are
voting?
   Is it any wonder that we celebrate the forthrightness of a
Mandela?

   Your editorial was most welcome. One would think that Mr.
Mandela's identification with the African National Congress
qualifies him for sainthood. If the South African problem is
resolved without a significant input from Chief Gatsha
Buthelezi and his moderating influence, some form of
communism may ultimately result.

   You do not understand the political thinking in the Third
World. The fact is, irrespective of any impressions drawn
from some of the so-called "responsible, moderate" leaders,
Third World countries do not share any common interest with
the Western world, particularly, the U.S. To you, Moammar
Gadhafi and Yasser Arafat are terrorists. In Third World
countries they are nationalist leaders and freedom fighters
of their people. You will never understand the thinking of
the Mandelas, because to do so will be in conflict with your
political culture.
   By the way, who is Mr. Buthelezi? The Western press always
knows about leaders in Africa whom the Africans themselves do
not know about. How can somebody who was a favorite of former
President Reagan be a genuine African leader?
   Except in the U.S. nobody in Africa knows Mr. Buthelezi as
a leader of any kind. He is a chief among the Zulus, and his
supporters among his tribesmen are fighting other members of
the Zulu tribe who are opposed to him. The Western press
always looks for stooges in Africa. Currently, Mr. Buthelezi
and Jonas Savimbi are your favorites.
   Back in the days when Zimbabwe was known as Southern
Rhodesia, there was also a "responsible, moderate" African
leader named Bishop Musorewa. Whatever happened to him and
the millions of his followers in Southern Rhodesia now known
as Zimbabwe? He went the way of all stooges -- into oblivion.
   Have you forgotten that like Yasser Arafat, Mr. Mandela
was also once branded a terrorist because he stood for the
freedom of his people. History is the greatest equalizer.

   We have visited South Africa twice and can compare its
accomplishments with the profound poverty in Kenya, Tanzania
and Mozambique. In 1981 we were surprised to see integration
being established in many unexpected areas. Although we abhor
apartheid, we felt honest, constructive attempts were being
made to abolish it.
   This spring we returned to see if we might have
misinterpreted what we thought we saw earlier. But we were
reassured by the loving concern of so many blacks and whites
for their homeland. We also saw many changes in the easing of
restrictions on blacks. It was very apparent that the ANC
represents only a minor segment, if a very vocal one, of the
black population and that many stories appearing in our
papers are of incidents taken out of context.
   We ask why, if South Africa is such a terrible country, do
so many blacks pour into it from all over Africa and so few
leave?

   The recitation of Mr. Mandela's praise for terrorists is a
sad reminder that this courageous and intelligent man is
probably not the national black leader that South Africa and
the world need on the road to peace. His consistent calls for
the violence of sanctions and sabotage continue unabated, and
he seems unable to grasp that he must reach out to all South
Africans if a new society is to be created.
   A rereading of his eloquent statement at his early-1960s
trial gives an eerie sense that time has stood still for Mr.
Mandela while he was behind bars. Though those bars are gone,
nothing has really changed in his mind. Tragically, he is
still a captive of his own creation, the terrorist African
National Congress, with his radical wife guarding the gates.
Let us pray that he can break out.

   While on the other side of Los Angeles Mr. Mandela was
surrounded by 80,000 disciples, mostly black, cheering
"Mandela, Mandela," I looked down from my hotel room and saw
a ghastly example of a decaying democracy. Do those cheering
thousands know what tragedy there is in their own back yard?
Are they giving their money and performing their native
dances on behalf of the black, brown and white adults and
children sleeping on the streets in the City of Angels?
   The previous night, before retiring, I had looked down to
see rows of coffinesque cardboard boxes in the Bank of
America parking lot. I assumed they were there to be gathered
by trash haulers in the morning. But come morning, a tragic
scene greeted me: One by one the cardboard boxes began
shaking, then the flaps opened and from each, like a hatching
pupa, a man emerged and stepped out. But these men,
predominantly black, were not hatching into a world of
beauty. Instead, they wandered over behind a dumpster to
answer calls of nature.
   As these men had slept in their cardboard cocoons, Mr.
Mandela had slept with dreams of making South Africa
democratic. As these men wandered in their desolate world,
80,000 souls with their new Mandela T-shirts and buttons,
with their hero's face shining before them, had satisfied
their consciences by performing and providing Mr. Mandela the
funds to right the wrongs of apartheid.
   Have they dared to look at the tragedy on the streets of
America? Do they acknowledge how democracy has treated its
very own? Did Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Bradley drive Mr.
Mandela past the Mission on Main Street and hold his head
high and say, "Look what we have accomplished"? Wake up
America] Look behind the facade of Beverly Hills and North
Rodeo. Throw your Mandela money to your black brothers, with
their festering sores. Someday they may turn your palaces and
gaudy shops into furnaces. Mayors of American cities and
newspaper editors, look to yourselves. Don't wait for a
president or for representatives in Congress to help. They
are too far away and think only of their own welfare and
re-election.
