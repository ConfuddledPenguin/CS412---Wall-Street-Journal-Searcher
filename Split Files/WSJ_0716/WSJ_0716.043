   VALLEY FORGE, Pa. -- It's 9:08 a.m., and the opening bell
hasn't yet rung at the New York Stock Exchange. But Vanguard
Group Inc.'s money machine already is pulling in cash at a
rate of $115 million a day, much of it from small investors
betting that the stock market will go higher still.
   The phone calls are pouring in so fast that what Vanguard
calls its Swiss Army has been mobilized to answer them. This
army consists of reservists: employees such as Curtis
Hilliard, a Vanguard lawyer. No matter that he spent five
years with the Securities and Exchange Commission before
joining Vanguard to handle complex legal documents. Right now
he is fielding a call from a small investor in Scotch Plains,
N.J. Sometimes things get so busy, Mr. Hilliard says, that
"you see the chairman down here answering the phone."

   Overhead, a digital display keeps the troops posted on how
well the phones are being answered. At the moment, it shows
just one caller, who has been on hold for only two seconds.
In the battle among big mutual funds for the individual
investor's dollar, answering the telephone quickly can clinch
a sale, while a busy signal can send a frustrated buyer to a
competitor.
   This year most mutual funds are doing well. Stockbrokers
are scraping for business, but 1,100 mutual funds that invest
in stocks are being flooded with new money, as many small
investors seem to have shrugged off memories of the 1987
crash. Investors big and small have sunk $12.1 billion more
into stock mutual funds than they have withdrawn this year,
already outstripping the $5.8 billion net inflow for all of
1989. The money is helping to fuel a bull market in stocks
that on Friday pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above
3000; it closed at a record high of 2980.20 on volume of
nearly 220 million shares.
   If dollars continue to flow into the nation's $268 billion
pool of stock funds at the current pace, this will become the
industry's best year ever for stock-fund sales, topping even
the record year 1986.
   Vanguard, with $21 billion in stock-fund assets under
management, seems likely to become one of the biggest
winners. It already ranks as the third largest distributor
and manager of equity funds behind American Funds Group, with
$22 billion, and Fidelity Investments, with $43 billion.
Vanguard says net cash inflow into its stock funds so far
this year is running slightly ahead of 1989, a record period
for the firm, when it was flooded with cash after briefly
reopening its top-performing Windsor Fund to new investors.
   Despite predictions of slumping profits and industry
consolidation after the 1987 crash, earnings of mutual-fund
management companies have remained buoyant. Prices of shares
of publicly traded management companies such as Dreyfus Corp.
and Pioneer Group Inc. have rallied to within 25% of their
1987 highs, and the price on shares of Franklin Resources
Inc. hit an all-time high this past April. Few mutual-fund
managers laid off employees after the crash; nobody at
Vanguard got a pink slip.
   By contrast, shares of big stockbrokerage firms such as
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
Paine Webber Group Inc. are still trading at about half their
'87 highs. The brokers continue to report lower earnings,
layoffs and write-downs.
   A number of investors say they turned to mutual funds
after unhappy experiences with stockbrokers. Natalie Whitney,
a retired World Bank employee from Vienna, Va., began buying
stocks in 1975 through a large retail brokerage firm. The
outcome, she says, was "just horrendous. I had just got
divorced. He started putting me in shorts and margins, all
the sort of stuff that sophisticated people should be doing.
Within six months I was down to zero."
   She turned to mutual funds because, she says, they seemed
to offer good performance over the long run. Since then she
has put much of her money into six Vanguard mutual funds. She
says she picked Vanguard because she was impressed by its
long-term record and its low expenses.
   Marcia Lach, a retired marketing manager for Time
magazine, says her investing through stockbrokers "was one
disaster after another." So for more than 10 years, she says,
she kept her money in a money-market fund. Early last year,
she began putting it into stock mutual funds. Now, says Ms.
Lach, who lives in New York, she has a quarter of it in
Vanguard funds, which attracted her because of their
efficient record-keeping and low expenses.
   Many full-service brokerage firms are beginning to sense
that lots of small investors have lost interest in buying
individual stocks. Thus, a number of firms have started their
own stock funds. But many brokerage firm officials still
insist that a substantial number of investors value the
advice of a broker.
   Baltimore's Legg Mason Inc., a regional brokerage firm,
has continued to generate healthy earnings and gets few
customer complaints. But Chairman Raymond Mason concedes that
the fund managers are tough competitors. "The beauty of being
a Vanguard or a Fidelity is that they offer everything, so
they always have something that's doing well," he says. "The
brokers don't know what to do. They've been whiplashed by
1987 and all they've gone through. If the markets perform
well, they'll get their confidence back. The brokers haven't
been pushing that hard."
   If anything, the crash may have helped the mutual-fund
companies. Individual investors, burned back then by brokers'
recommendations, seem less fearful of entrusting their money
to diversified mutual funds managed by professional portfolio
strategists. When the funds perform poorly, the small
investors tend to blame it on their own timing. "We didn't
find much in the way of recriminations after the crash," says
John Brennan, Vanguard's 35-year-old president. "Our
investors accepted it was their decision" to invest when they
did.
   Could the small investors' timing be off again? This year,
Mr. Brennan says, "the level of interest in equities is
significantly greater. Whether it's well-timed or not is
always the question."
   Adds Robert Christy, a Vanguard telephone representative:
"A lot of people seem to be getting back into the market,
though it doesn't seem like an opportune time to me. I look
at what people do and I say, should I do the opposite? Once I
did that. In March, I saw people getting out of international
{funds}, so I got in." The funds performed well during the
second quarter.
   Mr. Christy, who works in Vanguard's shareholder services
department, is preparing for the lunchtime onslaught of phone
calls between 12:30 p.m. to 1 p.m. The other busiest time is
between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., when shareholders -- anticipating
the close of the stock market -- call to switch money among
funds.
   Vanguard's first mutual fund, the Wellington Fund, is one
of the country's oldest, organized in December 1928. It took
the fund seven years to grow to $1 million in assets. "I
didn't eat so well in those days," says Wellington's founder,
91-year-old Walter Morgan, who still comes to the office
twice a week.
   Vanguard is unusual among mutual-fund management companies
in several respects. For one, it is owned by shareholders of
the funds it manages. For another, it relies far more than
most on word-of-mouth; by Vanguard's estimate, Fidelity
spends seven times as much on print advertising, and Dreyfus
six times as much.
   How do Vanguard's executives and employees profit? They're
all awarded a hypothetical stake in the company -- "phantom"
shares paying a yearly dividend. The amount depends on a
complex formula that compares Vanguard's investment
performance and its operating expenses with those of its
competitors. But the formula doesn't reward employees simply
for pulling in assets, because Vanguard doesn't want unhappy
shareholders who were lured into a fund they don't really
want to own. How much is this yearly dividend worth? A
$26,000-a-year junior supervisor typically would hold about
300 shares; this summer, such an employee got a dividend of
$12.98 a share, or $3,888.
   Fund Action, an industry newsletter, estimates that the
average fund manager earned $362,000 last year. Vanguard says
its fund managers' salaries are competitive with those of
other fund groups, adding that it gets its cost advantage
from greater efficiency and from the fact that the
shareholder-owned firm doesn't face the same pressures as its
competitors to turn a profit.
   Vanguard takes a tight-fisted approach to other costs,
though. Its bland suburban offices here offer a sharp
contrast to the more opulent digs of its competitors; some
Vanguard fund managers operate out of offices that are hardly
bigger than a closet. Last year, Vanguard trimmed one-eighth
of an inch off the size of its newsletter in order to save on
postage; the firm estimates the move will save it $50,000 per
mailing.
   The actual owners of Vanguard Group -- the shareholders of
its mutual funds -- collect no dividends, but benefit from
the low expenses. Vanguard imposes no up-front sales charge,
or "load," and its yearly expenses typically consume only
$3.50 per $1,000 invested in its funds, compared with a
mutual fund industry average of $10.90.
   Rival companies take a different tack. "We don't believe
it's necessary to be the lowest cost producer," says James
Riepe, a managing director with T. Rowe Price Associates who
worked at Vanguard from 1969 to 1981. "Vanguard has had some
funds that haven't done very well, and having a low expense
ratio hasn't helped those shareholders."
   As for performance, Vanguard ranks in the top 10% of all
fund families over periods of one, three, five and 10 years,
according to Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Co., a Boston mutual-fund
research firm; only American Funds Group gets a higher rating
from the research firm.
   For the modern mutual-fund company, however, making money
for shareholders isn't the only goal. It's just as important
to keep new money flowing in efficiently, helped along by
telephone representatives who answer calls promptly,
prospectuses that arrive in the mail only days after
requested and fund statements that are always accurate.
   Executives of Vanguard consider its aura of effortless
efficiency so important that they have contingency plans to
deal with a power outage, a snafu at the local phone company
or a snowstorm that keeps phone reps from getting to work.
The company's new $8 million data center has its own
electricity generators, and Vanguard has contracted with a
local supplier to provide diesel fuel should there be a
prolonged power cut. "The business has to go on," says Mr.
Brennan.
   Vanguard's biggest fear is what Chairman John Bogle calls
"the 202 scenario." That's a doomsday vision in which
Vanguard's phone system breaks down, shareholders panic, and
the half-mile-long road between Route 202 and Vanguard's
Valley Forge, Pa., headquarters is jammed with cars bearing
panicky shareholders anxious to reclaim their money in
person.
   April 1987 was the closest Vanguard ever came to that
nightmare. When the bond market plunged that month,
shareholders rushed to redeem their shares. On April 7 alone,
Vanguard's representatives answered 27,000 calls.
Shareholders, desperate to get through to a phone rep, were
kept on hold for an average of 80 seconds. A new telephone
system, introduced the year before, almost failed to handle
the volume of calls.
   So Vanguard created the Swiss Army, a force of lawyers,
accountants and money-market-fund managers who can be
mobilized to answer calls when they begin to back up. On Oct.
19 and 20, 1987, as the stock market collapsed and partly
rebounded, the Army fielded many calls. The average telephone
volume on those two days matched that of the previous April
7, but shareholders typically got to a rep in 20 seconds.
   This time around, there was little panic selling. Most
callers were interested in finding out how far the market had
fallen and assuring themselves that Vanguard was still in
business.
   The $115 million Vanguard now takes in on an average day
begins arriving at 6:30 a.m., when the mail is collected from
the Valley Forge post office. Other cash arrives by
electronic transfer directly from shareholders' bank accounts
or is collected at two centers that Vanguard maintains for
walk-in customers.
   Much of the money these days is going into the Vanguard
Index Trust-500 Portfolio, an index fund that buys and holds
the stocks that make up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. Index
funds are this year's hot product.
   Joe Feldman, an international tax consultant currently
based in Oxford, England, owns four different Vanguard stock
index funds. He chose Vanguard, he says, because "they are
the efficient player. They're the one with the linoleum
floors."
   Vanguard and other fund companies execute investors' buy
or redeem orders only once a day; a fund's share price is
determined after the markets close at 4 p.m. But investors
hungry for information have pushed the companies to operate
round the clock. After Vanguard's phone banks close at 5
p.m., an answering service takes over, typically fielding 750
calls a night.
   Many of the callers who speak with Vanguard's telephone
representatives seem mainly interested in talking about the
market. Sitting across the aisle from Mr. Hilliard, the
lawyer, is Jana Koser, a senior telephone representative, who
is taking a call from a Philadelphia man who wants to know
how Vanguard's giant Windsor Fund fared the day before. It
closed down 14 cents, Ms. Koser tells him.
   The caller goes on to chat. He says he has made his money
owning and managing apartment buildings and now has $400,000
in the mutual funds that he hopes to turn into much more. "I
try to swing for the home run," he says. "I'm fairly good at
it. But if I wind up eating the meatball, as they say, I can
always switch and hold for the long haul. After all, who
wants to lose money?" By the end of the conversation,
however, he admits to having lost money in his junk-bond fund
and his gold fund.
