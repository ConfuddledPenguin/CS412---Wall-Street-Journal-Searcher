   Do you remember where you were and what you were doing
when Deborah Norville joined the "Today" show, the historic
moment that would cost executives their jobs, martyr Jane
Pauley, and ignite nationwide fury? Probably not. History has
a way of sneaking up on little cat feet, like the fog, which,
as it happens, is what this particular piece of history most
resembles. Hard as it may be to believe now, some of us
mistook this event for a mere staff change on a morning talk
show. At best, one thought, "Today" has entered a younger,
blonder phase. Not till press and publicists got to work did
we understand that this was in fact the beginning of a great
epic.
   Here was a full-scale morality tale which unfolded, week
after week. Virtue triumphed in the end while the evil-doers
got their just reward, universal obloquy. All America
supposedly was aghast at the jettisoning of Ms. Pauley (a
mature woman with children, one commentator pointed out) in
favor of the lissome and childless Ms. Norville. Professional
tube watchers began to talk about Ms. Pauley rather as though
she were a humble victim, some welfare mother or feminist
radical denied tenure by the Harvard geology department
instead of the millionaire wife of a millionaire cartoonist.

   The press, which was mainly responsible for the growth and
nurturing of this entire mad saga, eagerly documented its
every detail. Ms. Pauley's farewell to "Today" was a major
media event of high suspense revolving in large part around
the question: What would the lady's often brusque co-host
Bryant Gumbel do, what would he say?
   Putative millions hoped against hope that he would stand
up for her, say something moving and significant as befit
this high occasion. As it turned out, what Mr. Gumbel said
was, "You know how I feel, Jane."
   Then the story's pendulum swung back, knocking Ms.
Norville off her perch with reports of ratings losses for
"Today," bulletins about Ms. Norville's lack of ease, rumors
of rancor among affiliate stations.
   Ms. Pauley, on the other hand, was said to be thriving.
She was now to be seen as a frequent anchor on NBC's
prime-time news, and, it transpired, she was a future
supernova for whom NBC now had big plans. In short, her
forced march away from "Today" was now to be viewed as hazard
of new fortune, fortune certain to be good.
   This week, however, Ms. Pauley's luck runs out again.
Anyone who wants proof should take a look at the new
prime-time show created for her and beginning tomorrow night
from 10 to 11 p.m. EDT on NBC. The name of this piece of bad
luck is "Real Life With Jane Pauley." In it, Jane and other
correspondents busy themselves scrutinizing supposedly
ordinary folk through the lens of pop psychology, while
buttressing the enterprise with statistics about things no
one in his right mind has any interest in measuring -- the
number of rolls of film Americans use in an hour, or how many
disposable diapers they throw away in that time, or the
percentage of the nation's traffic that passes over
interstate highways.
   The real ruling principle of this adventure, however, is
chaos. It begins with an inquiry about the lack of time in
the lives of several hard-working couples. Nobody has time to
eat, to sleep, to make love, so busy are these Americans at
their jobs, and a grim picture of so-called ordinary life it
is, too. You marvel, watching it, how so many Americans, with
so little time -- if this portrait is to be believed -- for
the necessities of life, found all that time to dwell on the
injuries done Ms. Pauley and the changes in the "Today" show,
as we have been assured they did.
   Part two surveys the overabundance of gadgets in American
life, a report also replete with statistics. We learn, from
lord knows what source, that 80% of Americans who have VCRs
don't know how to program them. But do not suppose there is
no social significance in this statistic. For Dr. Sherry
Turkel, MIT's cyber-Freud, is on hand to reveal that "our
life is full of objects that are stressful." She explains
that VCRs are stressful because we don't see how they work.
   Somewhere along the way here, we learn that Americans use
more than two million rolls of film a day and also that
"family albums fill up fast at this time of year." Ms. Pauley
imparts wisdom like this with aplomb. In such doings, she is
aided by correspondent Boyd Madsen, who tells us that there
are four million miles of roadway in the U.S., and then takes
us down one of them to visit a "unique American phenomenon,"
a man whose main claim to fame is a large bottle collection
and the fact that he lives in a makeshift house by the side
of the road. If this unique American phenomenon already is
beginning to sound like a lot of people who inhabit the
streets of our cities, you are not alone in thinking so. This
man also sings and dances. But Mr. Madsen announces
sorrowfully that this sort of American phenomenon is quietly
disappearing from our landscape. Let him visit my road.
   One considerably more interesting segment concerned an
adopted girl's search for her mother, who turns out, when she
finally finds her, to be a demented homeless woman. This
story, like most of the others here, reveals a good bit about
the mindset of this production, in which "real life" in
America turns out to be the dark, the marginal, the extreme,
the underside of that life. Ordinary life as it is actually
lived is, of course, a subject whose drama has yet to grab a
television producer.
   Someone must have sensed the need to get some sort of
weight into this production, and concluded that the way to do
it would be to deliver facts, which are at least reliable.
But what is one to make of naked data such as that every hour
in the U.S., "people eat three acres of pizza"? Or that 2,500
people per hour quit their jobs?
   Jane Pauley has the unenviable job of imparting all this,
and worse. What was to be a new start, NBC's first effort to
showcase its new-found old star, thus turns out to be
something closer to a repeat offense, if this first sampling
is any measure. To put the matter bluntly, with such friends,
Ms. Pauley may not need any enemies.
