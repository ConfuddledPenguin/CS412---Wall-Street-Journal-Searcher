   Ronald Kessler's account of an all-American boy who grew
up to be a KGB spy should provide some comfort to those who
lay awake wondering whether, in the Gorbachev era, espionage
literature will become passe. "The Spy in the Russian Club:
How Glenn Souther Stole America's Nuclear War Plans and
Escaped to Moscow" (Scribner's, 320 pages, $19.95) is in some
sense the nonfictional counterpart to John Le Carre's "The
Russia House." Both books suggest that even in the springtime
of European peace, the primary aim of U.S. and Soviet spies
will be unchanged -- to decipher the nuclear potential of the
other side.
   Mr. Le Carre's Soviet physicist aimed to uncloak the
Soviet arsenal and reveal its weakened dagger. Mr. Kessler's
true-to-life villain works the other side. Glenn Souther, we
are told in a dramatic first chapter, was potentially "one of
the most important spies in U.S. history."

   Mr. Kessler, a former reporter for this newspaper and for
the Washington Post, and a veteran espionage writer, zeroes
in on the central issue for any spy tale: motivation. Talking
to virtually everyone in Mr. Souther's life who mattered --
up until he defected in 1986 -- he finds that Mr. Souther's
Indiana childhood was far from the idyll it seemed. Though
popular in his church choir and a charmer of ladies, Mr.
Souther also was obsessed with practical jokes and liked to
don the uniform of a Confederate Army soldier. Mr. Kessler's
thesis -- that treason against the state was an expression of
rage against an icy father -- sounds cliched, but rings true.
   After joining the Navy in 1976, Mr. Souther immediately
began breaking rules by sending home classified pictures of
Soviet aircraft. Stationed in Europe as a petty officer on
the USS Nimitz, Mr. Souther read up on communism, decided
that U.S. society was flawed, and in 1980 walked into the
Soviet embassy in Rome and offered his services to the cause.
He then plunged into a world of secret drops, radio codes,
specialized cameras and invisible ink. After he confessed to
his Italian wife that he was spying on the "imperialists,"
she tried to alert the Navy, but was brushed off as an
unhappy spouse.
   After he divorced his wife, no novelist could have planned
Mr. Souther's career any better. He got an honorable
discharge, joined the naval reserve and enrolled in Old
Dominion University, majoring in Russian. It all was part of
a Soviet plan to enhance his chances at doing high-level
intelligence work.
   In 1984, he was assigned to the supersensitive naval
intelligence center in Norfolk, Va. -- which keeps a
computerized list of U.S. nuclear targets. In his job of
enlarging spy-satellite photos, Mr. Souther apparently had
free rein over the entire building, "a spy smorgasbord." As
Mr. Kessler says, "Souther had access to all of American's
nuclear war plans."
   The Navy comes off poorly, not only for ignoring a tip but
also for overlooking more than a few telltale signs. Mr.
Souther kept a library of books on communism and frequently
denounced the U.S. government. And he drew attention to
himself by spending far beyond his apparent means.
Incredibly, his security clearance was upgraded to top secret
even after he was convicted for jumping on a female college
student and biting her neck.
   Mr. Kessler shares a lode of spycraft -- such as how
satellite photos are analyzed -- and he recognizes that
"there is a conflict between good security and using
intelligence effectively."
   Where the tale breaks down is in Mr. Kessler's inability
to reach the most essential sources. His efforts to interview
Mr. Souther were cut off last year when the latter, out of
his element in Moscow, killed himself. Mr. Souther's KGB
contacts also are beyond the author's reach. The result is
that we see his spying at one remove, through the lenses of
associates and girlfriends. Mr. Kessler relates far too much
of their impressions and hurt feelings.
   How often did Mr. Souther meet his Soviet masters? What
secrets did he steal? Mr. Kessler reports that the Soviets
paid the deceased spy an uncommonly public tribute, comparing
him to the legendary Kim Philby. Pravda, in fact, praised him
for having had access to "plans of the U.S. Navy's operations
in a nuclear war." Thus, Mr. Kessler concludes that "while
the Soviets never flatly said Souther gave them America's
nuclear war plans . . . a reasonable person would conclude .
. ." But a conjecture based on a eulogy published in Pravda
surely is open to question.
   There also is the tiny matter that, since Glenn Souther's
defection, the Cold War has all but evaporated. Though Mr.
Kessler is sharp on the fine points of spying, one wishes he
had paid more attention to the larger question of what
changes may be in store for espionage now that West and East
feel so chummy. By almost ignoring these changes, "The Spy in
the Russian Club" seems oddly dated. Though most of it occurs
in the 1980s, the tale of a naval seaman who falls for
Marxist ideology and plunges into a world of invisible ink
seems, against the background of recent headlines, no less
remote than a story from the time of the czars.
