   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. said the Delaware
Supreme Court upheld the company's position that a bylaw
amendment requires an 80% majority vote.
   As a result, the company said a consent solicitation by a
dissident shareholder group, Centaur Partners Group, to
expand the board has failed.

   Centaur had proposed to amend the bylaws of the company to
increase the board to 15 directors from 12. Because Centaur's
solicitation fell short of an 80% majority, only three seats
will be up for election at the annual meeting July 25, as has
been planned since last year.
   Centaur said it was disappointed in the ruling, but would
try to elect three nominees to the board. National Intergroup
is a wholesale drug distributor.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
National Intergroup closed at $18.50, down 25 cents.
