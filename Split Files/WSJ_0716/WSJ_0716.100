   The Mountainview, Calif., concern said it expected to
report that revenue for the quarter ended June 30 fell
"substantially short" of the year-earlier quarter's.
IntelliCorp.'s net income in the year-earlier quarter was
$394,000, or five cents a share, on revenue of $6 million.
The maker of artificial-intelligence software cited an
unexpected slowdown in sales of its old product line. The
company said it is in the process of introducing a new
product line.
   IntelliCorp.'s stock closed at $4.75 a share, down $2.125,
in national over-the-counter trading Friday.
