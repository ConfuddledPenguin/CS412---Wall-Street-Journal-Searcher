   General Development Corp. said a U.S. District Court judge
in Miami rejected a plea-bargain agreement reached between
the company and the government involving an alleged
conspiracy to defraud thousands of home buyers.
   The ruling was another setback for the Miami-based
community developer, which filed for bankruptcy protection in
April and has laid off about 1,600 workers this year. A
spokesman said General Development, following the decision
Friday, immediately entered negotiations with the U.S.
attorney's office in Miami to work out a new plea-bargain
agreement.

   The rejected plea-bargain agreement between the company
and U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen had called for General
Development to make restitution estimated at $80 million to
$100 million over 25 years.
   But Judge Lenore Nesbitt, according to the General
Development spokesman, said the agreement "didn't give her
enough flexibility to determine an appropriate sentence in
light of the scope and severity of the charges."
   Under the same reasoning, Judge Nesbitt also rejected
plea-bargain agreements reached between the government and
General Development's former chairman, David F. Brown, and
its former president, Robert F. Ehrling.
   Attorneys representing Mr. Brown and Mr. Ehrling couldn't
be reached for comment.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney in Miami said the
government is prepared to go to trial, but added that
"substantial negotiations will take place over the next few
weeks."
   In March, the U.S. attorney unsealed a 16-count indictment
against General Development, its financing unit -- GDV
Financial Corp. -- and Mr. Brown and Mr. Ehrling. The
indictment, which culminated a two-year grand-jury
investigation, alleged that the company had schemed to sell
its Florida homes, primarily to out-of-state buyers
unfamiliar with market conditions, at grossly inflated prices
based on improper appraisals.
   Prosecutors said 9,600 to 10,000 home buyers were
affected. The company's appraisals were based on what
prosecutors say were other overpriced General Development
homes -- not properties in the community at large -- and,
thus, exceeded fair-market value, prosecutors said.
   Under the rejected plea-bargain agreement, General
Development pleaded guilty only to one of the 16 charges and
agreed to pay a fine of as much as $500,000. The company also
agreed to enter into a civil-consent decree enjoining it from
the fraudulent sales practices detailed in the indictment and
requiring it to set up a massive restitution program to pay
back allegedly defrauded homeowners by paying a part of their
mortgage payments. The company agreed to pay a maximum of
$2.5 million a year for the first five years and then pay the
balance in installments to eligible homeowners over an
additional 20 years.
   Mr. Brown and Mr. Ehrling also agreed to plead guilty to a
single charge that would have exposed each to a maximum
prison sentence of five years.
   In rejecting the agreements Friday, Judge Nesbitt noted
that the indictment exposes each of the two former General
Development officers to a maximum jail term of 115 years.
   The spokesman for General Development said Judge Nesbitt
has scheduled a hearing for Aug. 7 to review any new
plea-bargain agreement or, if necessary, to set a trial date.
