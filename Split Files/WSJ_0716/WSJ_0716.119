   Suffield Financial Corp., citing a continued sluggishness
in New England's real-estate market, charged off about $2.1
million in loan-loss provisions and posted a second-quarter
loss of $2.2 million, or 36 cents a share.
   This compares with a $472,000 profit, or eight cents a
share, the Suffield, Conn., bank-holding company reported the
year earlier.

   Suffield said it wrote off about $1.7 million of
nonperforming loans in the quarter and took the $2.1 million
charge to replenish its loan-loss reserves.
   "There has been no significant increase in nonperforming
assets during the second quarter," a company release said,
adding: "Nevertheless, we believe it is in the best interests
of the company to increase the allowance for loan losses
during these uncertain economic times in New England."
   For the six months, the company reported a loss of $5.4
million, or 90 cents a share, compared with earnings of
$988,000, or 16 cents a share, the year earlier.
