   Chrysler Corp. is delaying plans to market by next year a
midsized car built by South Korean auto maker Hyundai Motor
Co.
   Last year, Hyundai agreed to provide Chrysler with a
version of its Sonata sedan to sell as 1992 models through
Chrysler's Jeep-Eagle dealerships. But the No. 3 U.S. auto
maker said Friday that the two companies "have now agreed to
focus on a more highly differentiated version of the
successor to the Hyundai Sonata," which analysts don't expect
to arrive until 1994.

   Chrysler, of Highland Park, Mich., and Hyundai had already
planned to make their two versions of the car look different.
But they apparently decided further changes were needed that
couldn't be completed by the fall 1991 launch of the 1992
models.
   "The only way to be successful selling those cars through
Chrysler will be if Chrysler gives them their own distinctive
styling cues," said Christopher Cedergran, an analyst with
J.D. Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills, Calif., research
and consulting firm.
   A Hyundai official in Canada, where some Sonatas are
built, said his company expects delays of several months in
the Chrysler agreement, which calls for Chrysler to buy up to
30,000 cars a year.
   Still, Willy Lee, assistant to the president for corporate
planning at Hyundai Auto Canada Inc., said his company will
be able to deliver about 10,000 cars to Chrysler during the
arrangement's first year in 1991.
   Mr. Lee said the pricing of the cars is the primary
sticking point between the companies. He said Chrysler "is
requesting our parent company to share certain portions of
the incentives" that Chrysler thinks will be necessary to
sell the car in the U.S. Chrysler didn't comment on the
pricing issue.
   Hyundai hasn't been very successful selling the Sonata in
the U.S. to date. Last year in the U.S., Hyundai sold just
35,000 of the cars, which compete head-on with the Toyota
Camry and Honda Accord. Sales through June this year in the
U.S. and Canada are running even lower. "That may be an
element of the deal's being held back," Mr. Lee said.
   The slow sales have caused Hyundai's Bromont, Quebec,
plant to run far below its annual capacity of about 100,000
vehicles -- a problem the Chrysler deal was supposed to help
alleviate. Mr. Lee said the plant will assemble only 40,000
units this year. Hyundai is thinking about shifting some
Excel subcompact car production from Korea and possibly
adding a new minivan-type vehicle to make the Bromont
facility more efficient.
   Chrysler's talks on possible product marketing and
development ventures with Italian auto maker Fiat S.p.A are
further complicating the relationship with Hyundai.
   Chrysler officials and analysts said the Fiat talks may
result in Chrysler getting a version of a Fiat car that would
make the low-volume version of the Sonata less important in
Chrysler's line-up.
   The Hyundai venture was deemed important to Chrysler when
it was signed last year because Chrysler was the last U.S.
auto maker without ties to a car maker in South Korea. At the
time, South Korea was an increasingly important source of
low-cost cars. But that adavantage has slipped away from
South Korean companies recently because of rising labor and
other costs.
