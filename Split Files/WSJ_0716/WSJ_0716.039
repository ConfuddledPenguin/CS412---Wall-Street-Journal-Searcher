   THOMSON CSF, a French manufacturer of military equipment,
was selected by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service to provide the technological system for producing a
new generation of "green cards" for resident immigrants in
the U.S. The cards themselves will continue to be made in
Arlington, Texas. Thursday's edition incorrectly said the
cards would be made in France.
