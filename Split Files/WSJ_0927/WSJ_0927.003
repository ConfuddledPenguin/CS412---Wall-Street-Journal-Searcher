   NEW YORK -- The dollar was mixed yesterday as rumors of
war in the Persian Gulf competed for attention with policy
statements by monetary officals, leaving the market without
any clear direction.
   Toward the end of the New York session, the greenback was
higher against the yen and the Canadian dollar, but lower
against most continental European currencies.

   The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 136.84
yen, up from 136.72 yen late Tuesday in New York. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 1.5650 marks, down from
1.5725 marks.
   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 137.65
yen, up from the 137.40 yen close there Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5660
marks, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5675 marks.
   Wednesday's thin trading session was described as
indecisive and frustrating, as most dealers tried to keep
their slates clean ahead of accounting for month-end and the
close of the Japanese first half, both on Sunday.
   Bank traders grumbled that the market fluttered every time
a finance official spoke at World Bank and International
Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. And they said dealings
were prey to rumormongers.
   The dollar had already lost ground to the yen late
yesterday after an unnamed German monetary official said the
yen should appreciate against the mark and Japanese Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said the yen should rise against
both the dollar and the mark.
   "You don't have to study economics, just wait for one of
them to speak," said Ty Tan, a New York dealer with Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank, of the officials.
   Yesterday, the dollar stabilized against the yen but fell
against the mark when Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
pledged to the IMF that the high costs of German unity won't
lead to "any concession as far as monetary stability is
concerned."
   Mark bonds already yield more than their U.S.
counterparts, attracting purchases of the German currency.
   Meanwhile, wild stories, all unfounded, began flying right
from the start of Tokyo trading. One asserted that Iraq had
bombed a Saudi pipeline, another that the Iraqi occupiers
were destroying Kuwait's oil infrastructure.
   The London and New York markets matched those rumors with
tales claiming that Egypt had invaded Iraq and that Iraq had
stormed U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Baghdad.
   Oil markets in Europe and the U.S. whispered that the U.S.
had shot down an Iraqi plane. Another story, told opposite
ways, said that Iraq had issued an ultimatum to the U.S. to
get out of Saudi Arabia or that the U.S. had issued Iraq an
ultimatum to leave Kuwait.
   "The market doesn't have its own idea of where the dollar
should be, so it waits for rumors or makes them up,"
commented Ralf Weidenhammer, manager of treasury and
foreign-exchange operations at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
   The rumors were given some credence yesterday because of
real fears of war. The United Nations Security Council voted
late Tuesday to impose an air embargo on Iraq. The decision
extends sea and land embargoes, but doesn't authorize UN
forces to shoot down planes violating the ban.
   Amid the gloom, the market proved unwilling to pick a
favorite currency and stick with it. With investors in a
bearish mood because of the drawn-out standoff in the Gulf
and high oil prices, all nations seem to have a cloud over
them.
   The Canadian dollar came under late pressure when Finance
Minister Michael Wilson told the Ottawa parliament that
domestic interest rates could continue their recent declines
"if there is a continuation of the easing of inflation and
the easing of economic conditions." Three-month Canadian
government bills currently yield about 12.5%.
   The Canadian currency was quoted in late New York trading
at 86.48 U.S. cents, down from 86.88 cents previously.
   The dollar ended European dealings mostly higher as the
threat of Persian Gulf hostilities bolstered the greenback.
   In Asian trading, the greenback ended mixed. The volatile
session saw wide swings in the yen and sterling. The U.S.
currency finished Wednesday in Tokyo at 136.84 yen, up from
136.72 yen late Tuesday.
   The dollar began lower on Mr. Hashimoto comment about
exchange rates but then rebounded when it failed to fall
below 136 yen.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $406.60 an ounce, up $4.20. Estimated
volume was a heavy six million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$407.25 an ounce.
