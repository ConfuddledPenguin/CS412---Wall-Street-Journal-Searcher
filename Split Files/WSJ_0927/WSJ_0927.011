   NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence, which fell sharply in
August after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, remained at a
seven-year low in September.
   The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index
remained at 84.7 in September, the same level as the revised
August figure. The index had registered 101.7 in July. It was
in the 115-117 range in the first quarter.

   "With little or no progress in the Kuwait crisis, the
consumer's continued uncertainty is perhaps to be expected,"
said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's
consumer research center. Mr. Linden added that consumers are
"increasingly concerned that inflation and interest rates
will be rising. Concerned consumers are cautious spenders."
   In the latest monthly survey conducted for the board by
National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, consumers
expressed slightly less confidence about current business
conditions and job availability. On the other hand,
expectations for six months ahead showed consumers expect
slightly better business conditions and employment prospects.
The survey uses 1985 as a base of 100 and covers 5,000
households throughout the U.S.
   The survey found 7.3% expect to buy an automobile within
six months, down from 7.5% in August; and 2.9% expect to buy
a home in the next six months, down from 3% last month.
