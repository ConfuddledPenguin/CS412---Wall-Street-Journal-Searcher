   WASHINGTON -- Seeking to reassert itself in the
congressional debate on clean-air legislation, the White
House offered House-Senate conferees a compromise.
   In a letter sent yesterday to the leaders of the
House-Senate conference committee, Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), President Bush said,
"I fear that the slow progress and apparent course of the
conference committee may jeopardize enactment of this
critically important legislation."

   So far, the administration has had little influence in the
deliberations, which have produced just one major accord so
far: an agreement on curbing industrial sources of smog that
the administration considers too stringent. The president's
proposal, which accompanied the letter and contained elements
from both bills, marked both an effort to spur the slow talks
and avoid blame if the negotiations fail to produce a bill in
the remaining weeks of the congressional session.
   "It was the president's initial bill and his agreement
with Senate that got the ball 90 yards down the field," said
the presidential domestic-policy assistant, Roger Porter,
using a football metaphor that three other administration
officials also employed yesterday. "Now we're trying to
figure how to get the ball the last 10 yards."
   Responding to the letter, Rep. Dingell and Sen. Baucus
each emphasized his intention to pass a strong bill this
year. Rep. Dingell added that "I'm sorry they didn't get the
letter to us when the House and Senate passed versions of the
Clean-Air Act four months ago before Memorial Day."
   Mr. Porter said the administration's compromise would cost
industry between $22 billion and $23 billion in the year
2005, when its provisions would be fully in effect. That's
less than the $25.4 billion price tag for the Senate and
House bills, according to the latest White House estimate.
   Among other points, the White House proposal calls for
adopting the Senate's acid-rain provisions. Although both
bills would reduce annual sulfur-dioxide emissions by 10
billion tons from 1980 levels, administration officials
contend that the Senate provisions would be more workable.
   The administration also prefers a controversial Senate
approach for reducing the cancer risk that remains for nearby
residents after factories have applied the best available
technology to curb harmful emissions. On reformulated
gasoline, which would be required to be sold in the smoggiest
cities, the compromise takes provisions from both bills, with
modifications designed to reduce costs and increase
flexibility for industry.
   The White House also is urging the conferees to adopt
Senate language on industrial smog rather than the already
accepted House provisions. It also reiterated its opposition
to a provision designed to provide financial assistance to
workers who lose their jobs as a result of this legislation.
Officials have said adoption of this provision could prompt a
veto.
