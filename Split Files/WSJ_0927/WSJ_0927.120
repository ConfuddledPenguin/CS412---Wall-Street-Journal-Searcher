   Du Pont Co., which has interests in chemicals, fibers and
energy, said it is building a plant in Brazil for the
grinding and packaging of titanium dioxide pigment, an
essential part of paint, plastics, paper and other products.
   The Wilmington, Del., company declined to disclose the
size of the investment. The plant in Uberaba, about 200 miles
north of Sao Paolo, is expected to begin operating in late
1991 and to serve the Brazilian market. Du Pont said the
plant is being built on a company-owned, 235-acre site with
ample space for constructing additional processing units
later. Plans call for developing the site into a full-scale
manufacturing plant by the mid-1990s.
