   ROME -- Enimont S.p.A. must remain intact and Italian,
according to conditions set by the government's
Interministerial Committee on Industrial Policy.
   After a meeting here, the policy committee decided that
Enimont's operating units can't be stripped and sold off in
parcels if private partner Montedison S.p.A., which holds 40%
of the venture, acquires complete control of the
public-private chemical partnership.
