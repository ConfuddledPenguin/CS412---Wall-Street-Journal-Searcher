   Mitsubishi International Corp. said it teamed up with a
former executive of Walt Disney Co. to develop theme parks
and related businesses in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere.
   Under terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi International, a
subsidiary of Japan-based Mitsubishi Corp., invested in Steve
Baker &amp; Associates. Steve Baker, based in Orlando, Fla., is
headed by the 42-year-old Mr. Baker, who left the Disney
company in 1988 after 22 years and owns 25% of the firm.
Financial terms weren't disclosed.

   Although Mitsubishi isn't buying any assets and has no
theme parks on the drawing board as yet, it joins a growing
roster of Japanese concerns seeking a foothold in the U.S.
entertainment business. Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp.
is having discussions regarding a possible acquisition of MCA
Corp., which owns Universal Studios and theme parks, and Sony
Corp. bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and is
exploring the development of theme parks, among other things.
   Steve Baker &amp; Associates, a sponsorship and management
firm with nine employees, seven of whom are former Disney
executives, specializes in the theme park industry. The
company raises sponsorship revenue for entertainment and
leisure projects, such as Ocean Expo, a marineland water
park, under construction in Myrtle Beach, S.C., for Addcorp,
a theme park concern also based in Myrtle Beach.
   "Mitsubishi has been our client for 10 months and they
want us to introduce them to the theme park business," said
Mr. Baker, who previously served as operator of Disney's
Magic Kingdom theme park and ultimately became head of
corporate sponsorship for Disney's Epcot Center in Florida.
Mr. Baker developed and coordinated contracts for more than
40 American corporations represented at the Magic Kingdom and
Epcot.
   Mitsubishi International registers about $14 billion in
trade transactions annually, handling more than 25,000 items
from raw materials to advanced electronics.
   Although financial analysts said there is a possible glut
of theme parks, "it can be extremely healthy if you undertake
a project carefully," said Seth A. Schachner, assistant
manager of business development at Mitsubishi International.
   Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said
although there is an "abundance" of theme parks, "a well
thought-out park with a good location can still be
successful." Mr. Vogel estimated that admission for large
amusement parks in the U.S. last year totaled about $130
million.
   Mr. Schachner said the companies are "developing a number
of projects," although he declined to be specific and said no
timetable was set.
