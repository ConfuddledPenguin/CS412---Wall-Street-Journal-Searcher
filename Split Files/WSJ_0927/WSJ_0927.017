   HANCOCK, Mich. -- D&amp;N Financial Corp. said it is reducing
its third-quarter dividend to 7.5 cents a share from 15 cents
to strenthen its capital position.
   The dividend will be paid Oct. 25 to stock of record Oct.
9.

   "The reduction in the dividend was made to strengthen our
capital position," said D&amp;N's chairman, Kenneth D. Seaton.
"Our board of directors believes it is prudent and good
banking practice to conserve capital at this time in
recognition of the uncertain commercial real estate market
and associated risks that we, as well as other financial
institutions, are facing."
   In the first half, D&amp;N earned $2.8 million, or 76 cents a
share, up from $1.2 million, or 33 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   In other action at D&amp;N Financial's regular board meeting,
the corporation announced changes to the boards of the
corporation and its subsidiary, D&amp;N Savings Bank FSB. R.
Daniel Musser's recent resignation from the savings bank
board "due to other commitments" was accepted, and George
Schwartz and Richard Nelson were appointed to the D&amp;N
Financial board. The staggered terms of the D&amp;N Financial
board were adjusted and the term of director Joseph Bromley
will now expire at the 1991 annual meeting.
   D&amp;N Financial has financial services offices throughout
Michigan, as well as mortgage banking operations in Arizona,
Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina and Texas.
