   LONDON -- A team of West German and American scientists
has produced large quantities of a new form of carbon that
may occur naturally in space and could find important uses as
an industrial lubricant on earth.
   The new substance is dubbed "fullerite," after the late
architect and engineer R. Buckminster Fuller. Like his
geodesic domes, each molecule of the material is shaped like
a soccer ball.

   Exact uses of the material won't be known for months, as
all its properties aren't yet known. But it's likely to join
a growing list of exotic, man-made materials finding uses in
engineering, aerospace and other fields.
   One possible application is as an industrial lubricant,
according to Alan Mackay, a crystallographer at London's
Birkbeck College, where Mr. Fuller once worked. In its
powdered graphite form, carbon is already used to reduce
grinding and wear in some high-precision machinery.
   The hollow ball-shaped molecules may also find uses in
chemistry, as submicroscopic capsules containing the
ingredients for chemical reactions.
   Very limited quantities of the unusual, 60-atom carbon
molecules were first produced in 1985 by researchers at the
University of Sussex. But the latest advance, reported in
today's issue of Nature, a British scientific journal, brings
the substance closer to commercial application.
