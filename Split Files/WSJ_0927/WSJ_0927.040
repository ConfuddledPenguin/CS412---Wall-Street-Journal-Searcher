   Shelby Steele makes his living as an English professor,
but his skills are those of a thoughtful psychologist. This
combination of qualities -- the sharp insight and the
healer's sympathetic concern -- has helped him write one of
the best books about race that has appeared in America in the
past 25 years, "The Content of Our Character" (St. Martin's,
175 pages, $15.95).
   Many people see race as a political issue, a matter of
power and pressure, entitlements and law. Mr. Steele begins
from a very different place. He was driven to write this book
by what he saw as the emptiness of the political debate about
color. He touches -- often brilliantly -- on many of the
standard public concerns: affirmative action, the crisis of
black leadership, Marion Barry's drug trial, campus racial
problems. But for Mr. Steele, who is black, race relations
cannot be understood except by looking at what happens
between ordinary people in ordinary situations -- and at the
ways black and white people think about themselves.

   One of his essays grows out of an episode in a washroom in
which a black man guilt-trips his white friend into
overtipping the black attendant. Another chapter dissects the
fleeting fear Mr. Steele once felt that a white woman selling
newspapers might be rude to him. In fact, she was perfectly
polite, but he mines the moment for all it is worth,
painfully examining himself in order to diagnose others.
   All nine of his essays attempt to answer the same
question: Why, after more than 25 years of legal change and
ebbing prejudice, are so many black Americans worse off
today? Mr. Steele poses the question with a
characteristically delicate touch, scrupulously careful not
to overstate the case. Unlike many conservatives who write on
race, he makes poignantly clear that blacks still face plenty
of bias: He himself wears a tie and carries a briefcase to
ensure that no one mistakes him for a menial worker. Yet
unlike some liberal blacks, Mr. Steele also sees -- and
celebrates -- the enormous changes of recent decades. His
family leads an integrated, prosperous, middle-class life,
largely free of any truly hindering discrimination. But Mr.
Steele is determined to understand why many other blacks have
proved unable to take advantage of this freedom.
   His answer is a psychological one, slightly convoluted but
with a sharp ring of truth. In essence, he believes that the
new opportunity blacks face often proves so frightening that
many retreat into a kind of underachiever's sulk. Mr. Steele
does not exactly blame blacks for this; the sympathetic
therapist in him would not allow that. He just explains how
the self-defeating mechanism works: how centuries of
oppression have filled blacks with self-doubt, and how
integration sharpens this doubt by requiring that they
compete with whites. All too often, though, instead of trying
to succeed at school or work, blacks evade their fear of
failure -- what Mr. Steele calls their "inferiority anxiety"
-- by avoiding opportunities and withholding effort. Only
this, Mr. Steele believes, can explain blacks' low grades,
high dropout rate and limited business achievement.
   All of this would be troubling enough, but it is
disastrously compounded by a final twist: Blacks often
explain their failures by blaming whites. Instead of facing
their fears and self-defeating behavior, many pretend to
themselves that their only problem is white racism.
   A different kind of writer would call this pretense a lie
-- and an unusually poisonous lie at that -- but even here
Mr. Steele is more concerned than righteous, more
understanding than polemical. He is deeply pained by the many
blacks who have come to live by this distortion, wasting
their energy exaggerating the prejudice they face. They avoid
the challenges of integration, retreating at school and on
the job into self-segregated enclaves. Many even ostracize
successful blacks -- because their very success exposes the
lie that white racism is an insurmountable barrier.
   Mr. Steele's message for other blacks is simple: Take
responsibility for yourself. White handouts can only prolong
dependency. Blacks must turn away from the "illusion of
deliverance by others," he writes, for "no illusion weakens
us more." The future lies not in collective political action
or a race-based group identity but in ordinary individual
effort and achievement.
   These are simple, old-fashioned values, seemingly
innocuous enough, but in fact Mr. Steele's message is deeply
radical today. By questioning the notion of a race-based
group identity, he is challenging what has become most
blacks' primary belief: that assertive sense of racial
solidarity that underpins everything from the way many vote
to the way they dress and wear their hair. By suggesting that
racial consciousness may be less a strength than a trap, Mr.
Steele is urging blacks to rethink their lives. He also is
asking other Americans to reconsider key ideals -- to
question whether goals such as ethnic pride and "pluralism"
are not in fact more dangerous than we think.
   Already, in spite of himself, Mr. Steele is being drawn
into the political debate. Conservatives, thrilled by his
opposition to affirmative action, have rushed to claim him as
their own, while orthodox black leaders are scrambling to
discredit him. In fact, Mr. Steele has written a far better
book -- far more searching and more challenging -- than
either these self-styled friends or enemies give him credit
for. No one who reads it honestly and with an open mind will
ever think about race in quite the same way again.
