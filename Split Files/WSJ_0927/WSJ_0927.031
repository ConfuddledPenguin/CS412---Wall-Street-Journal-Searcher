   DAMASCUS -- Nachle Achkar steps into The Street Called
Straight to explain Syria's subtle stance in the Persian
Gulf.
   Perched at one end of the biblical road, the merchant
points to where the street dips and twists before losing
itself in the spice souk. "From here it looks crooked," he
says. "But move over a few feet and hold your head just so,"
he adds, squinting, "and it looks perfectly straight."

   With that, Mr. Achkar ducks into the shade, eluding
further queries about politics.
   Labyrinthine logic comes naturally in this city of cramped
alleys and whispered thoughts. But rarely have Syria's
contortionist skills been tested so severely. By lining up
against arch-rival Saddam Hussein, President Hafez Assad has
put Syria in the same tent as old and bitter foes, the U.S.
and its moderate Arab allies. He has pitted Damascus against
a neighbor that espouses three pillars of Syrian ideology:
Arab unity, shared Arab wealth and the Palestinian cause. And
he has sent troops to the front of a potential war in which
most Syrians would rather be in the opposing trench.
   "For years, Assad has been the odd man out in the Arab
world," says a European ambassador in Damascus. "Now, he's
the odd man in."
   Syrians sympathetic to Iraq remain, for now, a very silent
majority. One reason is that Mr. Assad's iron-fisted regime
tolerates little dissent, and has put it down brutally in the
past.
   Another reason is that Mr. Assad still is hard-line on the
one issue that really counts to most Syrians. Asked about the
"current Mideast crisis," a restaurant cook named Kasim
Hasoun instinctively responds by talking about the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, not the Persian Gulf. "If the
Zionists don't leave our land, we will have another war, for
sure," he shouts, angrily mashing chick peas.
   Reminded that war soon may break out on Syria's other
flank, Mr. Hasoun shrugs. The Gulf conflict "is a side show,"
he says.
   Syrians' tunnel vision, and their broad support for Iraq,
bode poorly for Mr. Assad's flirtation with the U.S. and
moderate Arab states. If Syrian troops join battle against
Iraq, the now-muted anger with Mr. Assad could flare into
violence. If Israel is drawn into the Gulf conflict, Syria
almost certainly will switch sides. And if the U.S. shows no
signs of pressuring Israel to negotiate over the occupied
lands, Syrians' demonized image of America will quickly
re-emerge.
   At his home in a shady quarter of Damascus, Defense
Minister Mustafa Tlas serves up hot tea and frosty views of
Syria's odd bedfellowship with the U.S. in the Gulf.
"American troops don't know why they are in the desert," he
says. The only reason he sees is that "the U.S. seeks
supremacy in the world." Syrian troops, by contrast, are
"doing a holy job" by defending Saudi Arabia.
   To Gen. Tlas, as to many Syrians, the U.S. is "the great
engineer," set to tighten the screws on Israel as soon as the
Gulf conflict ends. If Israeli-held territory isn't liberated
through diplomacy, "we will take it," he says.
   Nor have Syrians softened their views on terrorism, the
main obstacle to closer ties with the U.S. The mere mention
of Ahmed Jebril, the Syria-based Palestinian who is thought
to have bombed Pan Am flight 103, enrages officials. "We know
the bombing was a Mossad operation," Gen. Tlas says,
referring to Israel's secret service. As proof he offers the
"fact" that 30 rabbis canceled their seats on the plane just
before takeoff, along with the foreign minister of South
Africa.
   Western investigators say that's ridiculous, but such
conspiratorial notions are rife in a capital that regards
itself as the only true champion of the Palestinian cause.
Damascus is headquarters to the "rejection front" of
Palestinian groups opposed to any negotiation with Israel.
Media criticism of Saddam Hussein pales beside the vitriol
aimed at Israeli leaders, who are referred to as "the Zionist
enemy" and often labeled in cartoons with swastikas.
   The wellspring of Syrian bile toward Israel is the Golan
Heights, a strategic highland that Israel has occupied since
the Six-Day War in 1967. The hilltops now bristle with radar
and eavesdropping equipment, underscoring the Syrian sense of
vulnerability; on a clear day, Israeli patrols can see
Damascus across about 40 miles of arid plains.
   Just as Israelis fear Damascus's old dream of a "Greater
Syria," encompassing Israel, Syrians believe that Tel Aviv
craves an "Eretz Israel" stretching from the Nile to the
Euphrates.
   The border town of Kuneitra, destroyed by Israeli troops,
has been left by Syria as a pile of twisted metal and
concrete, a monument to the Israeli occupation. "Destroyed by
the Zionists," says a sign on a gutted hospital, where
busloads of Iranian tourists visited on a recent day. Nearby
is a statue commemorating Suleiman Khater, a crazed Egyptian
who gunned down seven Israeli tourists in the Sinai in 1985
and later died in prison.
   "Even a madman can be a martyr and folk hero if he kills
Israelis," says Mamdou Adwan, a poet and playwright who has
published verse about the Egyptian.
   Mr. Adwan is the rare Syrian who criticizes Mr. Assad's
authoritarian rule. Last year he even signed a manifesto
praising the vilified British author Salman Rushdie. But
asked if he or any other dissident has ever questioned
Syria's stance toward Israel, or its spending 55% of its
budget on arms to achieve "strategic parity" with the Jewish
state, Mr. Adwan laughs. "On this issue," he says, "I doubt
any Syrian has ever had a dissenting thought."
   As with so much in Syria, though, contradictions abound.
Fanatically anti-Zionist, Damascus also is home to 3,000
Jews, many of them prospering. The traditional Jewish quarter
now is heavily populated by Palestinian refugees, who, in
1948, moved into homes vacated by Jews fleeing to Israel.
   "The only thing we don't do together with our Arab
neighbors is pray," says Nassim Hasbani, celebrating the
Jewish New Year at one of the city's 18 synagogues last week.
While it remains hard for Jewish families to emigrate, visa
restrictions are easing, particularly on unmarried women.
   Syria's 280,000 Palestinians, for whom Mr. Assad is a
self-styled liberator, are kept on an even tighter leash.
Distrusted for their support of Yasser Arafat, another
longtime foe of Mr. Assad's, they are denied Syrian passports
and cannot vote for, or serve in, Parliament. A visit to the
closely watched United Nations refugee camps -- fairly easy
in Jordan and Israeli-occupied lands -- requires 10 days'
advance notice in Syria so officials can approve.
   Split vision extends to America. Despite two decades as
the Soviets' main client in the region, Damascus is the most
Western of Arab capitals. Young women in sleeveless blouses
and short skirts, an outfit that would be judged indecent in
Cairo or Riyadh, shop at stores called "Hallo Baby" or eat
ice cream at a parlor called "Alaska." Nightclubs abound, as
do cinemas showing Western movies. Each day at dawn, the line
of Syrians applying for visas to the U.S. stretches around
the block.
   "While Syrians understand the strength of our relationship
with Israel," says U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian, "they
also look at the U.S. as the city on the hill, the
avant-garde nation which is equated with what is new."
   As evidence of warming relations, he points to the release
of some Western hostages held in Lebanon, the toning down of
anti-American propaganda and the ready access U.S. diplomats
have to Mr. Assad, most recently during a visit to Syria by
Secretary of State James Baker.
   "But nothing is swept under the rug, including the issue
of terrorism and human rights," the ambassador says of the
new dialogue. "We're not playing softball here."
   Nor are the Syrians. As part of a growing cultural
exchange between the two countries, the managing editor of
the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, Fayez alSayegh,
recently spent a month touring the U.S. Back in his office in
congested downtown Damascus, he puffs on a Marlboro and puts
the finishing touches on a piece about Montana.
   "The plains are a green dress, embroidered with flowers,"
he reads aloud. Gazing dreamily out at the traffic, he waxes
eloquent about American hospitality (so sincere]), American
airports (so modern]) and American submarine sandwiches (so
big]). "It is a great country," he concludes, "except that
everything in America is subject to the will of the Zionist
lobby."
   It is this abiding anger at U.S. support for Israel that
kindles Syrian support for Iraq, which foreign diplomats and
Syrians say appears to be strong among three-quarters of the
12 million population.
   While many Syrians regard Saddam Hussein as a reckless and
brutal man -- there is little of the adoration for the Iraqi
leader obvious in Jordan -- they respect the guts and power
he has displayed in confronting the U.S. The anti-sheik
strain of Iraqi invective also strikes a chord in Syria, a
poor country often visited by rich Gulf Arabs in search of
drink and sex.
   "Saddam's only mistake," says one student at Damascus
University, "is that he didn't take the whole Gulf while he
had the chance. No Syrian wants to die defending harem sheiks
and Western oil supplies." The pro-Iraq reports on Jordanian
TV picked up in Syria have further fueled Iraqi support,
especially by Palestinians.
   Many Syrians also support Saddam Hussein simply because he
is the foe of their own leader. While Damascus is filled with
stickers and signs proclaiming "We Love Assad" (with a heart
in place of the word "love"), few Syrians express any
affection for their president. An austere figure with a taste
for documentary films and vegetarian food, Mr. Assad has
brought stability to a land that experienced 12 coups in the
two decades before he consolidated power in 1970.
   But his regime runs first and foremost on fear. Among Arab
states, Syria's secret police network is second only to
Iraq's. The Assad regime's brutality became obvious in 1982,
when the crushing of Moslem fundamentalists led to the
destruction of the city of Hama and the massacre of 10,000 or
more of its inhabitants.
   "Since Hama," says a Syrian academic, "public opinion has
stayed very private." While there has been some pro-Iraq
graffiti in recent weeks, no one has yet found evidence to
support reports of riots in eastern Syria.
   Nonetheless, there are signs of insecurity in Damascus. A
BBC correspondent who reported the rumored riots was kicked
out of Syria the same day. Palestinian groups sympathetic to
Iraq have been barred from distributing their literature. The
regime also has launched a rare public-relations campaign,
dispatching party officials to the provinces to defend
Syria's stance.
   While Mr. Assad argues convincingly that Iraq's annexation
of Kuwait undercuts Arab opposition to Israeli occupation,
the essence of his position is a 20-year-old blood feud with
Saddam Hussein over leadership of the Baath Party, and of the
Arab world.
   In an apparent gesture to public opinion, the state-run
Syrian media, which for years derided Saddam Hussein as a
"butcher" and "henchman," has treated the Iraqi president
gingerly since the invasion of Kuwait. And in a major speech
on the Gulf this month, Mr. Assad didn't mention Saddam
Hussein by name, referring only to the blunders of "our
brothers in Iraq," which he said had forced foreign forces to
enter holy Arab soil "to the benefit of the Arab nations'
enemies and in the interests of Zionism, which continually
hatches conspiracies."
   For now, Syrians have no choice but to accept this fig
leaf for Mr. Assad's desire to finally extinguish Saddam
Hussein, which he failed to do by supporting Iran in the
Iran-Iraq war. Most Syrians regard the sending of troops to
the Gulf -- 4,000 so far, expected to grow to 20,000 -- as a
symbolic gesture, though it could quickly become more than
that if shooting breaks out.
   Many Syrians also welcome the economic rewards they may
reap as a result of Mr. Assad's stance. At a time when Soviet
support is slipping, the Gulf states are likely to come to
the rescue of Syria's troubled economy. The European
Community also is planning new loans, and if Syria ever gets
off the State Department list of states supporting terrorism,
it could receive U.S. aid as well. As a modest oil exporter,
Syria already has profited from higher oil prices.
   "If the population has the view that economic paradise is
around the corner, that will go a long way to salving public
opinion," says a Western diplomat. Inflation is over 50% and
decrepitude is obvious throughout Damascus. Ancient buses
lack hoods and belch black fumes; the phone system is a
crackly tangle of crossed lines; even the presidential palace
has dim bulbs and broken elevators.
   But hiking up the six flights of stairs to his office,
presidential adviser Assad Elias warns against thinking that
Syria can be bought or easily influenced. "If good comes to
Syria materially from this, fine," he says. "But the only
payoff we are looking for is something concrete from the U.S.
on the Arab-Israel conflict."
   Mr. Elias and other Syrians want an international
conference leading to Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
lands. But Mr. Adwan, the poet, doubts that even such an
event would soothe Syrians' wounded pride and frustrated
dreams of greatness.
   With typical Syrian indirection, he tells an ancient story
about a knight named al-Muhalel who fights a bloody 40-year
war to avenge the murder of his brother. Peacemakers come to
him and ask, "What is it you want to end this war? Gold?
Camels? Women?" He tells them to ask the daughter of his
murdered brother.
   Her answer: "I want my father."
   Mr. Adwan drains his glass of arrack and smiles wryly. "We
want what we can't have," he says. "We want poetic justice."
