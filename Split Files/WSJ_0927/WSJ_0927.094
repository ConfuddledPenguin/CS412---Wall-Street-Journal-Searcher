   OTTAWA -- Canada and the U.S. have reached an agreement
aimed at reducing tensions between U.S. fishermen and
Canadian patrol boats.
   The clashes have occurred mainly in Georges Bank, a big
fishing ground in the Gulf of Maine, where some U.S.
fishermen who have been caught fishing in Canadian waters
have tried to outrun Canadian patrol boats. Disputes also
have occurred on the Pacific Coast, where Canadian fishermen
have been caught in U.S. waters.

   The agreement requires each country to prohibit its
fishermen from violating the fisheries laws of the other
country.
   "Fishermen who violate fisheries laws in the other country
will no longer be able to escape enforcement action by
crossing back across the border into their own waters,"
Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said. The accord
also will reduce tensions along boundary areas, he said.
