   MAN AG of West Germany, an engineering, machinery and
vehicles concern, said it agreed to sell its 76.91%
controlling stake in KM -- Kabelmetal AG, a major producer of
copper products, to Societa Mettallurgica Italia S.p.A., or
SMI, of Italy for 551.7 million marks ($350.9 million).
   SMI, a holding company controlled by the Italian
industrialist Luigi Orlando, is Europe's largest copper
producer with 20% of the market. MAN said it will receive
265.70 marks for each of its KM shares.

   The remaining 23.09% of KM is held by private investors.
KM shares are listed on the Frankfurt bourse and closed
Wednesday at 211 marks. In the year ended June 30, KM earned
eight marks a share on sales of 2.6 billion marks.
   An SMI spokesman said KM would remain a separate entity
and operate next to SMI's Europa Metalli-LMI S.p.A.
nonferrous metals unit. SMI doesn't plan to buy out KM's
minority shareholders, he said. "It will remain a listed
company."
   The sale is to be completed Nov. 2.
