   NEW YORK -- Investors knocked down stock prices, spooked
by rising oil prices and a rout overnight in Japanese stocks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.99 to 2459.65 in
moderate trading. Longterm U.S. Treasury bond prices were
flat in light activity. The dollar was mixed, also in thin
trading.

   Even though oil prices overseas were lower before U.S.
stock markets opened yesterday, the mood among traders was
negative because of the sharp drop in Tokyo stocks. The
Nikkei index plunged 4.75% on Mideast jitters.
   The decline in U.S. stocks nearly wiped out Tuesday's
32.67 point gain in the Dow industrials. "Everyone is looking
to get out now," said Christopher Pedersen, director of
trading at Twenty-First Securities. "People are looking for
2200" on the Dow, he added.
   Mr. Pedersen said another depressant for stock investors
was a report in this paper suggesting that investors
shouldn't take it for granted that the Big Three auto makers'
current dividend levels are sacrosanct. "That's not very
comforting," he said.
   Another blow to stocks was a sharp reversal in oil prices
soon after trading began. Crude oil futures for November
delivery ended the day up $1.14 a barrel at $38.67, after
being down briefly as much as $1 from Tuesday's close. Peter
Beutel, oil futures analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group,
said the initial oil price decline -- following a drop the
previous day -- was halted by some investors who saw the dip
as a buying opportunity.
   Oil prices kept moving higher on U.S. Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney's comments to a gathering of economists that
the embargo may be pushing Iraq to the brink of lashing out
militarily. Also, a spate of unconfirmed war rumors ran
through oil trading pits -- including one that Iraq had given
the U.S. 48 hours to leave the Mideast.
   While current oil supplies appear adequate, Mr. Beutel
said that traders are justified in bidding prices as high as
they are, since war remains a strong possibility, and an
Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabian oil fields is likely if
hostilities break out. "Saudi oil can't be replaced," he
said. "The only people with spare capacity on that level are
Iraq and Kuwait."
   While bond price movements were shallow, said Raymond W.
Stone of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates, those
movements nevertheless followed the opposite path of oil-up
in the morning on lower oil prices, down in the afternoon on
higher oil.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 155.6 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues overwhelmed
advancers, 1,119 to 421.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 9.12%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency fell to 1.5650 marks from 1.5725 marks and rose
slightly to 136.84 yen from 136.72 yen Tuesday.
