   Kinetic Concepts Inc., in restructuring its hospital
equipment rental operations, will lay off about 10% of its
1,500 workers and take a third-quarter charge of $6 million
to $7 million, or seven cents to eight cents a share, Dr.
James R. Leininger, chairman, said.
   Kinetic Concepts expects net income of $1 million to $1.5
million, or two cents to three cents a share, in the third
quarter, compared with $6 million, or 12 cents a share, a
year earlier.

   Revenue is expected to rise 32% to $59 million to $60
million from $44.6 million, the company said, largely as a
result of the acquisition July 2 of Medirec Inc., a Utah
medical rental concern with $50 million in annual sales.
   The layoffs address excess capacity in the national
network of 150 service centers and at headquarters in San
Antonio. The retrenchment will account for $1 million to $2
million of the charges.
   For the nine months, earnings will be about $13 million,
or 25 cents to 26 cents a share, compared with $18.9 million,
or 38 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said.
Revenue will rise to about $155 million from $130 million, it
added.
