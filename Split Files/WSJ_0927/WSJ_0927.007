   AN AIR FORCE engineering supervisor's statement before a
House subcommittee -- that a Northrop Corp. cruise missile
guidance component hasn't ever caused an operational
test-flight failure -- was contradicted by documentation
previously disclosed in The Wall Street Journal. Because of a
typographical error in yesterday's edition, the contradictory
nature of the statement wasn't indicated.
