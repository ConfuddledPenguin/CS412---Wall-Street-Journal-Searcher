   WASHINGTON -- Fewer than 10% of the nation's high school
seniors have the skills necessary to perform demanding jobs
or do college work, according to an analysis of national test
results.
   A comparison of results on tests given to students in the
fourth, eighth and 12th grades shows that schools are doing a
worse job today of teaching so-called higher order skills in
reading, mathematics and science than they were 20 years ago.

   For instance, the analysis said, on the latest tests given
by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which
measures what school children know, only 5% of high school
seniors could "synthesize and learn from specialized reading
materials." Only 6% can solve multistep math problems and use
basic algebra, and 8% showed on science tests that they can
"draw conclusions using detailed knowledge." In history, only
5% showed that they know and "can interpret relatively
detailed information and ideas."
   "These are skills we usually associate with the ability to
function in demanding jobs in the workplace or the capability
to do college work," said Emerson Elliot, the acting U.S.
commissioner of education statistics. A recent survey
reported that 75% of college faculty members believe that
students entering college lack basic skills.
   The new report, called "America's Challenge: Accelerating
Academic Achievement," is a collection of earlier test
results. Education Department officials said they issued the
report to help call attention to the nation's poor school
performance. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos called the
report "a compendium of disappointment." Noting that the
report is being released a year after President Bush and the
nation's governors held an "education summit" that produced
an ambitious set of goals for the year 2000, Mr. Cavazos
said, "This report indicates that we have a long way to go."
   Officials noted that the causes of the problems aren't
new: too much TV and too little homework, too much passivity
in the classroom and too little parental interest in how the
children do in school. The survey said that 56% of U.S. high
school seniors read a total of 10 pages or less each day for
all their course work.
   The survey of 20 years of test results does contain some
good news that reflects the "back-to-basics movement" of the
past decade. More students are mastering fundamental skills
such as basic math problems with whole numbers, and the gap
between white students and black and Hispanic students is
narrowing. But "very few students demonstrated that they can
use their minds well," the report said. Many students avoid
or can't find challenging courses in science and other
subjects, the report said.
   Chester Finn, chairman of the panel that runs the national
assessment, said low college entrance requirements are partly
to blame. "If colleges don't require chemistry, kids won't
take chemistry," he said.
