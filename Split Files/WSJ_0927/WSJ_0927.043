   SYDNEY, Australia -- Alan Bond resigned as chairman and
director of the company he founded, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.,
in an apparent move to pave the way for the foundering
concern to be restructured.
   Peter Lucas, a Bond Corp. director and the company's chief
spokesman, was named chairman.

   Mr. Bond in July foreshadowed his intention to step down
if European holders of certain Bond Corp.-related securities
would approve the proposed sale of the company's Australian
breweries. The breweries are one of the last remaining major
assets of a far-flung corporate empire that spanned property,
media and telecommunications, natural resources and brewing.
   Bond Corp. proposes to sell the breweries to its 58%-owned
unit Bell Resources Ltd., which in turn plans to sell half a
stake in the breweries to Lion Nathan Ltd., a New Zealand
brewer.
   The European investor group is expected to meet in London
Thursday, and some of those investors have been discussing a
plan to swap their debt for a stake in Bond Corp. If that
takes place, further changes in Bond Corp.'s management are
likely. As part of his commitment to the investor group, Mr.
Bond has said he will reduce his voting rights in Bond Corp.
to 25% from about 58% currently.
   A spokesman in London for the investor group wasn't
immediately available to comment.
   Even if the European investor group approves the
breweries' sale, it could still come unstuck unless a group
of investors that hold $510 million in debentures issued by
Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. in the U.S. agree to sell their
securities back to the company at a discount.
   Bond Corp. said several of its long-time executives also
resigned Wednesday. They include Tony Oates, who was in
charge of the company's finances, and Peter Mitchell, who
headed corporate development. The three men, though, plan to
stay on as consultants until the proposed breweries' sale and
shareholder restructuring are completed.
   As the company has run into financial trouble and
Australian securities regulators launched investigations into
its affairs, a number of directors have resigned.
   Some Bond Corp. watchers think the steps by Mr. Bond and
other executives to distance themselves from the company may
also be aimed at taking the steam out of a special
investigation into the company's affairs by Australia's
corporate watchdog. However, Charles Williams, deputy
chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission,
said the resignations won't affect the probe.
