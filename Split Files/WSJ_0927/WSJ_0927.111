   Federal Paper Board Co. reported substantially lower
fiscal third-quarter earnings, citing problems in a paper
mill expansion project.
   The Montvale, N.J., pulp and paper maker said net income
for the 12-week quarter ended Sept. 8 was $21.9 million, or
48 cents a share, down 55% from $49.1 million, or $1.06 a
share, in the year-earlier period. Sales were $294.2 million
compared with $295.3 million a year before.

   For the 36 weeks ended Sept. 8, the company reported net
of $95.3 million, or $2.07 a share, down 35% from $147.6
million, or $3.22 a share. Sales rose 4.4% to $928.2 million.
   Federal Paper Board said operating earnings were hurt by a
series of mechanical difficulties mostly related to the
expansion project at its mills. It also noted a
12-cent-a-share non-cash charge for the retirement of assets
associated with the expansion project and a decline in market
prices for paper pulp.
