   Small Businesses
   Fight Untaxed Rivals

   SMALL BUSINESS, sick and tired of competition from
tax-exempt groups and government agencies, is turning to the
states for relief.
   Congress has wrestled for years with the issue of business
activity by universities, churches, hospitals, museums and
the like. But it hasn't been able to agree on what action to
take. Small businesses want to discourage tax-free
organizations from selling goods and services not directly
related to their charitable purpose at below-market prices.
Nonprofit groups have vigorously fought such a restraint.
   With no federal bills emerging, the Washington-based
Business Coalition for Fair Competition, a coalition of 31
small-business trade groups, is circulating a 27-page model
bill to state legislatures. Many legislatures will begin new
sessions in January. Arizona, Colorado and Iowa have enacted
laws to discourage activities by government agencies, but
their statutes lack enforcement powers and don't cover
nonprofit groups.
   The model bill would make it state policy for government
agencies to refrain from competing with small business, and
would set up a panel with authority to force agencies to end
anti-competitive practices. The bill would also force
nonprofit groups to pay business and property taxes when they
compete with for-profit concerns, and would limit their
commercial activities.
   "With nonprofit groups, it's a little stickier," says
Theresa Stanion, who is the coalition's director. "I don't
think we can get nonprofits out of commercial activities. We
just want them to pay their taxes."
                                                                                                       

   Financing Floats In
   For Fish Farming
                                                                                                       

   AQUACULTURE is going swimmingly, some investors and
venture capitalists believe.
   Enthusiasts see a bright future in the cultivation of
seafood and plants in ponds, tanks and coastal-water pens
because sea catches can't keep up with the world's appetite
for fish and crustaceans. And increasingly, hard-nosed
managers are entering a field previously dominated by rice
farmers and marine biologists.
   Binghamton, N.Y., businessman Ara Kradjian and several
partners invested $5.5 million to start Naiad Corp. of
Liverpool, Texas, this year. President Tom Farrell says Naiad
is talking to venture capitalists about a possible $2 million
infusion.
   "We're looking for a more market-driven approach" than the
typical farmers' cooperative, Mr. Farrell says.
   While farmers often just grow and sell their fish, Naiad
does everything, growing catfish (and, soon, redfish, striped
bass and tilapia), processing it and marketing it. It expects
to finish building ponds on 4,000 acres in 1991, and
forecasts revenue will rise to more than $30 million within
three years from $13 million in its current start-up year.
   Andrew Davlin, publisher of The Aquaculture Industry
newsletter in Pauma Valley, Calif., says aquaculture has been
growing at between 20% and 25% a year in the U.S. and at 10%
worldwide in recent years. U.S. catfish production has soared
to 360 million pounds in the latest 12 months from one
million pounds annually in the 1960s, he says.
   "Professional people are coming in with marketing and
business know-how," Mr. Davlin says, attracting venture
capitalists. An early breakthrough: a $12 million investment
from eight venture-capital firms of Aqua Group of Clearwater,
Fla., in March 1989.
                                                                                                       

   More Entrepreneurs
   Opt to Own, Not Lease
                                                                                                       

   INCREASING numbers of small-business owners are opting to
own rather than lease office space. "The small-business
person almost has to buy" at some point, says John Mattimoe,
the Small Business Administration's assistant administrator
for finance and investment in California, as well as four
other Western states.
   The SBA, through direct loans and loan guarantees, is a
major player in small-business office purchases. Mr. Mattimoe
says that so far this fiscal year his region, the SBA's
biggest, has approved 2,825 loans, about 12% more than in the
comparable 1989 period. He says about 60% of those loans --
forming a substantial part of the increase -- were for the
purchase of office space and other business facilities.
   One company that switched is Arrowhead General Insurance
Agency of San Diego. Patrick Kilkenny, chairman and principal
owner, says Arrowhead had been renting for seven years before
buying a 13,000-square-foot headquarters a few months ago. He
says his company will be paying "much less" as an owner.
(Developers and brokers, however, caution that ownership
doesn't usually bring substantial savings right away.)
   SBA rules allow buyers to put down 10% of the purchase
price of business real estate, with banks and the agency
financing the rest through a 25-year note. Bankers say they
like such loans because federal guarantees protect them.
   Ownership offers tax advantages, bankers say.
Entrepreneurs who put the building in their name can deduct
interest and depreciation expenses on their tax returns. The
company pays rent, which it can deduct on the corporate tax
return.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   OF 1,500 entrepreneurs asked in mid-August by United Group
Information Services of Hurst, Texas, whether they thought
the U.S. is entering a prolonged recession, 43.1% said no and
42.5% said yes. . . . Only 8.5% of U.S. companies with fewer
than 100 employees export, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
That's up slightly from 8% in 1988, when a previous survey
was made.
