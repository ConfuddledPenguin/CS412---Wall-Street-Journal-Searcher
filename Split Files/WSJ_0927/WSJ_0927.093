   Tecumseh Products Co. said it will have a third-quarter
loss of about $14 million to $16 million, after taking a
$19.2 million charge for an environmental cleanup near a
plant.
   The Tecumseh, Mich., maker of compressors, engines and
pumps said the per-share loss will be about $2.50 to $3.

   The charge, which comes to $3.51 a share, goes to clean up
PCB contamination in the Sheboygan River near a Tecumseh
die-casting plant. The plant used PCB, a suspected
carcinogen, as a fire retardant in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Tecumseh had net income of $27 million, or $4.94 a share,
in the first half of 1990.
