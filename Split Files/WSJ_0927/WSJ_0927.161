   If It Looks Like a Bear and Walks Like a Bear,
   Chances Are That the Bear Market Has Arrived

   Attention investors: You are now entering bear territory.
   Investment pros usually define a bear market as a fall in
stock prices that lasts at least two months and drags down
prices at least 20%. We're just about there.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a peak -- actually,
twin peaks -- at 2999.75 on July 16 and July 17. Since then,
it has fallen 18% to 2459.65. A decline that pierces the 2400
level would make this a bear market by almost anyone's
definition.
   Indeed, some money managers and analysts have been saying
for weeks or months that a bear market is upon us. "The
Middle East crisis has unleashed a fearless, relentless bear
on the financial markets," Carmine Grigoli, chief strategist
for First Boston, wrote recently. "Until the crisis is
resolved, or the market moves to much lower levels, the bear
will not be put back into its cage."
   If broad measures of stock-market performance are used,
the current market qualified as a bear some time ago. For
example, the Value Line index, which includes some 1700
stocks (in contrast to 30 in the Dow industrials) peaked Oct.
9, 1989, and has dropped about 30% since then. The NASDAQ
Composite index of over-the-counter stocks peaked the same
day and is down about 27%.
   Assuming we're in bear country, what should investors
expect? Based on precedent, the decline will carry stock
prices considerably lower. In bear markets, stock prices
typically fall about 38%, and the decline usually lasts about
19 months.
   If a bear market started in July -- and it proves to be of
average ferocity -- investors can expect the Dow industrials
to drop to about 1860 by the end of next year. When would a
recovery start? If things flow normally, some time around the
beginning of 1992.
   And how will investors recognize the bottom when it comes?
One sign: Investing will become so scary that it seems like
an unnatural act. Another sign -- again, assuming that
history proves a guide -- is that stocks probably will have
sunk to prices not far from their book values, or assets
minus liabilities. And the average dividend yields on stocks
probably will be up near 6%.
   The market is a long way from such levels now. When the
Dow industrials almost reached 3000 last July, stock prices
were pretty rich, compared with book values and dividends.
Investors may have taken comfort -- false comfort, in
retrospect -- from the fact that stocks weren't as pricey as
they were before the 1987 crash. But those 1987 valuations
were some of the richest ever.
   Now that stock prices are falling, investors such as
Charles Brandes, president of Brandes Investment Management
in San Diego, look foward to hunting for bargain-priced
stocks. Mr. Brandes, whose accounts are about 50% in cash,
has begun doing a little buying, but says "the market hasn't
gone low enough yet" to really plunge in. He expects to do a
lot of buying if the Dow industrials fall to the 2000 to 2200
range. He wouldn't be surprised if stock prices fell even
further, but at those prices, he wouldn't mind being early.
   Like Mr. Brandes, a lot of investors are watching and
waiting. In fact, one feature typical of bear markets is low
trading volume. In that respect, a bear market is far
different from a crash. A crash -- a sudden, massive decline
on heavy volume -- feels like being clubbed over the head by
Arnold Schwarzenegger, but at least the damage is over with
all at once.
   A bear market is more like water torture. On
low-to-moderate volume, the market falls more often than it
rises, over a long period. Investors may not get hurt much on
any given day. But when they total the damage a year later,
it's likely to be worse than that of almost any crash.
   Of course, a new bear market could be milder or more
severe than typical. Frederic E. Russell, a money manager in
Tulsa, Okla., is relatively optimistic. "I would say we're in
a bear market until the uncertainty in Iraq is resolved," he
says. And he concedes that right now the market is
"unnerving, even to the calmest person."
   But if the Mideast crisis is solved through "some bold
action, either military action or an ingenious face-saver for
(Saddam) Hussein," then Mr. Russell thinks things could get
better in a hurry. "The economic forces are not so powerfully
entrenched that they couldn't be reversed," he says.
   More pessimistic is Charles Will, a money manager in
Louisville, Ky., who anticipates the one-two punch of a
recession and a bear market. "We're probably looking at
between 1500 and 2000" on the Dow industrials, he predicts.
   If stocks fell to 1.08 times book value, as is typical in
past bear markets, Mr. Will notes, the Dow industrials would
fall to below 1400. If stocks fell until they yielded 6.1% in
dividends -- again the typical level at bottoms -- the Dow
industrials would be selling at about 1700.
   At those levels, Mr. Will says, he would be an eager buyer
of stocks. But for the moment, he has only 15% of his
portfolio in stocks, 5% in bonds, and 80% in cash (meaning
safe, short-term investments such as Treasury bills).
   Only investor complacency has kept stock prices from
falling further, says Salomon Brothers, in a strategy letter
by Robert S. Salomon Jr. and colleagues. After all, the
market has risen in 13 of the past 15 years, and each of the
two declines was less than 5%. "Investors talk as though they
were nervous," Salomon says. "But most people are not
trading" as if they were. Salomon's prediction: "The Dow will
decline to 2100" within nine months.
   Robert Stovall, head of Stovall/Twenty-First Consistent
Return Trust, says he's worried about some things that have
nothing to do with the Mideast. "Will Gorbachev make it
through the end of the year?" he asks. "When you don't have
bread or potatoes in the capital city . . . he may not make
it."
   Mr. Stovall also worries about how much longer George
Bush's political honeymoon will last, about the shaky
condition of financial institutions, especially banks, and
about the economy. He says: "We are definitely on the cusp,
on the lip, on the fringe of a recession."
   So, Mr. Stovall concludes that we're in for both a
recession and a bear market. He notes that stocks usually
turn down a few months before a recession begins, and turn up
a few months before it ends, as investors look ahead to a
recovery. Still, he says, it could easily be "a year before
this is over with."
