   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Litton Industries Inc. said it
will redeem all $440 million of its floating-rate
subordinated notes due 2000 for their face amount plus
interest accrued to Nov. 15.
   Litton said last month it planned to redeem the notes when
it announced a $1 billion offering of zero-coupon bonds. The
redemption will be funded with the $258 million net proceeds
from that offering and from internal cash, Litton said.

   Litton, a diversified technology concern, said the notes
will be redeemed at company headquarters here or at the
Midwest Securities Exchange Clearing Corp. in New York.
Interest on the notes will cease to accrue after the
redemption date, Litton said.
   "The redemption will strengthen the company's balance
sheet and improve our positive cash flow," Litton said. A
notice of redemption will be mailed to noteholders within the
next few days, the company said.
