   OTTAWA -- The Canadian Senate is threatening to defeat the
government's proposed value-added tax, causing alarm in the
business community that has spent millions of dollars
preparing for the new levy.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson told the House of Commons
yesterday that businessmen are saying there will be "chaos"
if the tax is scrapped.

   Sears Canada Inc., a Canadian subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co., said it has ordered 3.5 million copies of its spring
catalog with prices based on the proposed tax taking effect
Jan. 1, as planned by the government. It has also purchased
about 1,000 new cash registers and reprogrammed other
equipment to cope with the levy.
   Coinamatic Group, which operates 70,000 coin-activated
laundry machines, said it has been converting its equipment
to take more quarters to cover the cost of the new tax. But
the company has suspended plans to raise its prices to cover
the cost of the value-added tax, pending the outcome of the
legislative battle, said Richard Adamson, the company's
financial vice president.
   The proposed tax was approved by the House of Commons last
April, but has encountered strong resistance from the
opposition Liberal Party in the Senate, an appointed chamber.
The Liberals hold 52 of the 104 Senate seats.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the Liberals are
threatening to undermine Canadian democracy, by frustrating
"the will of the duly elected representatives of the people,"
in the House of Commons.
   To try to get the tax bill through the Senate, he
threatened to use for the first time in Canadian history an
exceptional constitutional power that allows the government
to appoint eight additional senators.
   Such action would require the approval of Queen Elizabeth,
the British monarch who is Canada's titular head of state.
Buckingham Palace officials told the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. that the Queen would approve the appointment of
additional senators if her approval was requested.
   Businesses, on government instruction, have been
collecting the proposed goods and services tax since Sept. 1
on any transactions that include 1991 business. The National
Arts Centre in Ottawa said that if the tax bill is defeated
it will have to reimburse customers who have paid the tax on
tickets for 1991 productions. "We're waiting like everybody
else to see if the tax is adopted," said box office manager
Robert Cousineau. "It is a bit stressful."
   The new tax, which is to cover most goods and services,
was designed to replace an outmoded 13.5% tax that is applied
at the manufacturers' level on a narrower range of products.
   Manufacturers of some products, including autos, have said
their prices will decline if the tax change occurs. To
encourage car buyers to purchase now instead of waiting for
the proposed tax change, Mercedes-Benz Canada Inc. is
offering a 3.5% price cut until Dec. 31.
   The uncertainty about the tax has been heightened by the
plans of the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia to
fight the proposed tax in the courts. The two provinces claim
the proposed tax is unconstitutional and infringes on
provincial rights. British Columbia also has threatened to
challenge in the court any move by the government to appoint
new government supporters to the Senate to get the tax bill
passed.
