   MALIBU, Calif. -- Thanks in part to the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles, surfspeak is washing across the nation like a
stoked tsunami. That's like, you know, a totally awesome
wave.
   Surfspeak derives largely from Standard English and is
very closely related to Californian. In fact, it has become a
sort of classical language, by Malibu standards, dating all
the way back to the ancient 1960s, when the Beach Boys were
really boys and Ventures was a rock band instead of things
that capitalists finance. Surfspeak has occasionally basked
in national favor and seems to have inspired much of what is
known as Valley Girl talk, thus extending its influence over
young people around the country.

   Now the language is beginning to receive scholarly
attention -- mainly from Trevor "Coconut" Cralle, 29 years
old, who may be the world's leading authority on it. In the
six years since he graduated with a degree in cultural
geography from the University of California at Berkeley, Mr.
Cralle has combed almost every known surfing spot on the West
Coast, Hawaii and Australia in search of the perfect wave and
the most esoteric slang.
   Mr. Cralle, who works as a writer-researcher for the
California Coastal Commission, has compiled his research into
a thick manuscript, "The Surfin'ary: A Dictionary of Surfing
Terms and Phrases," and is shopping it around to publishers.
"A lot of empirical research has gone into this," says Mr.
Cralle, who abandons his easygoing surfer-dude manner and
adopts an intense professorial tone when talking about his
book.
   Mr. Cralle has his own research methods. He goes surfing
and interviews his subjects between catching waves. "It's a
good way to get their confidence." he says. "They know I'm
not just some goob from the Valley" -- that is, the sprawling
San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. He also has
scrupulously culled every new slang word he can find from
articles in magazines, books and newspapers, and has
conducted interviews in surf shops.
   The Surfin'ary is designed to preserve and document a rich
subculture, Mr. Cralle says. But it may also have great
appeal for surfing wannabes or poser hodads or nons
(non-surfers) who want to sound like surfers while avoiding
sunburn and salt water and who have never tried to toe up on
a stick (to surf). Even people who don't know the difference
between a goofy foot (their left) and a natural (their right)
can talk like thrashers (surfing showoffs).
   Many of the Surfin'ary entries describe waves, women,
surfboards and geeks (originally, carnival side-show freaks
who bit the heads off live chickens) who can't surf. There
are also terms for less glamorous aspects of the beach-party
life style. Vomiting, for example, is "talking to the seals."
   Some terms have a religious cast. A great ride can be like
"going to church" or visiting "in the Pope's living room." A
great wave or an attractive woman can be "just like death."
   Mr. Cralle endeavors to catalog every usage, no matter how
obscure. Gremmies (short for gremlins) are either "trainee
surf mongrels on their way to full surf Nazi status" or
"selfish undesirable pest(s)" who are constantly causing
trouble for other surfers.
   Mr. Cralle defines hodad as "a surfer who rarely goes into
the water but still talks, acts and dresses as if he were a
minor god of the sport," or "a greasy hot rodder with long
hair and sideburns . . . an ill-mannered beach bum who
doesn't surf . . . generally anyone surfers don't like."
   Some Malibu surfspeak seems to have seeped through Topanga
Canyon to the San Fernando Valley to become Valley Girl talk,
popularized in 1982 by rock musician Frank Zappa and his
daughter, Moon Unit. "The Vals thought words like `gnarly,'
`rad' and `tubular' were cool, so they took them home," Mr.
Cralle says. All three words are strongly approbative
adjectives.
   The slang was exported to the rest of the world by
television, movies and records. Writers for the TV shows and
movies mostly live near the beach and they write down what
they hear, says Albert Lewin, a screenwriter who co-authored
the "The Thesaurus of Slang" with his wife, Esther.
   Music groups such as Surf Punks and The Surf MCs also have
spread the slang. Surf Punks, a Los Angeles band, includes a
glossary with every album. The Surf MCs, from Berkeley,
combines elements of rap and punk; the group's anthem is
"Surf or Die."
   Some words and expressions have moved the other way, from
the media into surfspeak. A male dweeb is often called a
"Fred" or a "Barney" and a female dweeb is "Wilma," after the
Flintstone characters. The Flintstones also have given
surfing "Yabbadabba doo]" an exclamation of exhilaration akin
to "Cowabunga]"
   Surfspeak keeps changing as it loses expressions to Valley
Girl and other forms of slang. Language helps true surfers
"identify the geeks," says Rick "Rocking Fig" Fugnetti, who
produces a surf report for a Los Angeles radio station. "But
once the Vals pick it up the lingo has to change."
   Says Erin Martin, a 17-year-old resident of Newport Beach:
"These Val guys are totally gross. They think they're real,
but you can tell they're Barneys." She says "dweeby types"
often "snog right up" to her when she's wearing her "floss,"
or thong-backed bikini.
   Robert L. Chapman, a retired professor at Drew University
and author of a dictionary of American slang, says that
"Southern California is the richest place for new slang,"
though much of it is ephemeral, lacking "the staying power of
black slang," for example. Surfspeak, says Prof. Chapman, is
like a skyrocket. "It goes up with a big noise, explodes in a
very colorful way and then poof, it dies."
   Yet a few terms, such as "gremmie," and "hodad" -- have
survived for more than a generation. "Hang 10" -- to curl
one's toes over the end of a surfboard -- is still used, but
not by most surfers; the boards they ride today are too short
to permit the stunt without the surfer losing balance.
   "Cowabunga]" is another old word. It began as the greeting
that Buffalo Bob and Chief Thunderthud exchanged in the
popular 1950s television program for children, "Howdy Doody,"
and was picked up as an exclamation by surfers, says Mr.
Cralle. It spread to the nation through the "Gidget" surfer
movies and, later the "Peanuts" comic strip. Now the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles have adopted it as their war cry and
enhanced its popularity.
   But surfers still use it, too. "Cowabunga -- it's a pretty
good word. It's powerful and enduring," Mr. Cralle says.
Certainly, he adds, "it'll outlast the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles."
