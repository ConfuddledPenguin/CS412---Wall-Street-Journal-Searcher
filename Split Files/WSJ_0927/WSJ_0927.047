   Dear Mr. Gorbachev:
   Your economy is a shambles, everyone is afraid to lend
money to or invest in your People's Republic, government-run
services are costly and inefficient, your streets are filled
with potholes, there is political turmoil and anyone who can
leave your workers' paradise is packing their bags.
</LP>

   I sympathize -- we have the same situation here in
Philadelphia.
   A few weeks ago, the bond-rating agencies dropped
Philadelphia's debt rating to junk-bond status. Our Finance
Director says we'll run out of cash in 12 to 18 weeks. For
the past three weeks the city government has been unable to
sell $450 million worth of bonds needed to cover its deficit
-- the third in three years.
   Like yours, our government is the largest employer in our
region and controls a sizeable portion of the economy. In
order to pay for this, it confiscates a large chunk of the
citizens' wealth, and redistributes it, via a 5% gross wage
tax, ruinous property taxes, a "business privilege" tax, a
tax on gross business revenues, a 4.9% real estate transfer
tax and a host of others.
   Preliminary census figures released last week show that in
the past 10 years, Philadelphia has lost 9% of its population
to the surrounding suburbs. In 1940, six out of 10 people in
our region lived in the City of Philadelphia. Today, only
three out of 10 live in the city.
   The solutions offered by our mayor and the people who hope
to succeed him probably sound familiar to you: Philadelphia
needs to get more money from other governments; it needs "new
leadership" and "cooperation"; it must reform the system;
and, it must raise taxes and reduce services -- again. All
agree that the city's problems are not its own fault.
   I propose we adopt the proposals of free-marketeers in the
Soviet Union and begin by privatizing three of Philadelphia's
urban "collective farms": our sanitation department, our
school system and our mass transit agency.
   Philadelphia has the highest garbage collection costs of
any major city in the U.S., and we councilmembers get
complaints about the service constantly. In 1988, the city
government asked private enterprises if they could do a
better job. Two companies offered to collect the city's
garbage on time, at approximately half the price the city now
pays, saving $80 million a year. They backed their offers
with million-dollar performance bonds. The powerful garbage
collective here wouldn't let it happen.
   A few months ago, property taxes were raised again to
cover the $44 million deficit of the school system -- a
system in which only 28% of students passed a statewide test
of basic reading and math, and a system that operates some
schools in which not a single student passed. A system where
only 41% of the Class of '88 graduated, and where 37% of
Hispanic students drop out before their senior year. The
government school's test scores are much lower than those of
non-government schools that teach the same inner city
children. And the government schools operate at twice the
cost of the average non-government school. But when I suggest
that parents be given education vouchers so they can choose
among competing schools and decide where their education
dollars will be spent, I'm accused of being un-American]
   Even though SEPTA, Philadelphia's government-owned mass
transit agency, has the highest fares in the nation and
receives a $45 million annual subsidy from city taxpayers,
it's asking for even more money to cover its $30 million
deficit. SEPTA says if it doesn't get what it wants, it will
shut the system down or severely cut back service. Private
operators are ready to provide an alternative to the
government-operated system at savings of 40% to 60%, but they
aren't allowed to. Here in the Cradle of Liberty, it's
illegal to compete with government buses.
   All three of these government-operated monopolies are run
for the benefit of the managers and employees. Salaries are
not based on performance and budgets are determined by
political jockeying among committees with insufficient
information. Sound familiar? Large, central government
bureaucracies then force the citizens to buy poor quality
services in insufficient quantity at high prices. A lot of us
are excited to hear about your move to democracy, but
economic liberty is just as important.
   We used to understand the benefits of liberty here in
Philadelphia. As I walk to my office in City Hall, I pass an
old red-brick building with a bell in front of it. There are
always scores of tourists -- many from your part of the world
-- waiting in line to go inside this building and touch the
bell. They are just discovering something that many in
Philadelphia have forgotten. Not only is liberty right.
Liberty works.
   If events over there get you down, I invite you to come to
Philadelphia and touch the Liberty Bell with me. What it
stands for may help both of us solve our common problem.
