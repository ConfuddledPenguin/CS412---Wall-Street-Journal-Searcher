   NEW YORK -- As if rising oil prices weren't enough,
over-the-counter stocks had to fight a losing battle against
unsubstantiated rumors.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up every bit and more of
Tuesday's 0.74% bounce as the price of oil rose more than $1
to surpass $39 a barrel on the November contract.

   The index finished the day at 350.03, a loss of 4.75
points or 1.34%. The day was only slightly better at the New
York Stock Exchange where the Big Board composite index
dropped 1%.
   "We're a hostage to oil. Whatever oil does, we're doing
the opposite," says Steve Bliss, head of OTC trading at Mabon
Nugent &amp; Co.
   Barry Berman, head of equity trading at Robert W. Baird &amp;
Co, says trying to focus past so many negatives -- Iraq, the
federal budget, tight credit, economic weakness, inflation --
has given investors too many reason not to buy.
   "There is an absolute paralysis on the part of an awful
lot of portfolio managers who have been shellacked recently,"
says Jonathan Raclin, executive vice president for equity
sales, trading and research at Chicago Corp.
   Adding to the real worries yesterday were a series of
rumors that all proved untrue. Traders reported the market
was hurt by talk of: a coup in the Soviet Union; an ultimatum
from President Bush for Iraq to evacuate Kuwait; air battles
in the Middle East; and the storming of the U.S. embassy in
Kuwait. None of the rumors was substantiated.
   There were 1,255 declining OTC issues and just 654
advancers. Volume increased to 118.7 million shares from
Tuesday's 109.9 million shares.
   Already skittish, investors didn't tolerate any hint of
disappointing earnings, and Oracle Systems disappointed
investors for the second time in two weeks.
   The software maker began its downward spiral when it told
investors two weeks ago that earnings wouldn't meet prior
projections. When the market closed Tuesday, Oracle reported
that fiscal first quarter earnings were even lower than it
projected Sept. 7. The firm reported a net loss of 27 cents a
share, below the 20-cents-a-share loss it predicted two weeks
ago. A year ago, Oracle had net income of nine cents a share.
It was the day's most active issue, losing 1 1/8 to 6 1/4, a
18% drop to a new 52-week low.
   Selling abounded in just about every OTC sector. Banks,
insurance companies and other interest-rate sensitive stocks
sustained losses.
   Home Savings Bank's merger with H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. is
tied to the price of H.F. Ahmanson stock. Both companies said
the merger agreement is secure. But as H.F. Ahmanson shares
slid 1 1/8 to 13 1/8 on the Big Board, Home Savings Bank fell
2 1/4 to 12 1/2.
   There were plenty more losses in the banking sector.
Ameritrust was 1 1/4 lower to 11 7/8. CoreStates Financial
lost 1 3/8 to 26 1/2. Midlantic was off 1 to 7 7/8. Michigan
National closed at 22 3/4, down 1 1/4.
   Among insurance stocks, Cincinnati Financial continued to
fall off its peak. After holding its gains longer than most
in recent weeks, Cincinnati Financial shares have been
falling as investors take profits and amid concerns about the
value of its equity portfolio. Its shares closed 4 7/8 lower
at 73 1/4.
   Ohio Casualty shares fell 3 to 31. Provident Life eased
3/8 to 17 1/2. Safeco was down 3/8 to 27 7/8. St. Paul Cos.
slid 3/4 to 51.
   Kinetic Concepts dropped 5/8 to 2 1/2 after revealing it
will lay off 10% of its 1,500 workers and charge $6 million
to $7 million against third quarter earnings. With the seven
cents to eight cents a share charge, Kinetic Concepts
projects third quarter net income of two cents to three cents
a share, down from 12 cents a share a year ago.
   Meridian Bancorp shares fell 1 1/2 to 11 3/4 on its
announcement that it anticipates a net loss for the third
quarter between 86 cents and 96 cents a share, fully diluted.
Meridian said its dividend is secure. It blamed the loss on
increased reserves for possible loan losses and a charge for
the planned sale of its title insurance operations. In the
year-ago quarter, Meridian earned 56 cents a share, fully
diluted.
   A delay in Collagen's plans to spin off its Celltrix unit
will cut its first months profit in half, the company said
late Tuesday. Collagen indicated its first six months net
income is likely to be between 10 cents and 12 cents a share,
down from 23 cents a share in the period a year ago. The
biomedical company's shares dropped 2 to 16 7/8.
   Ashton-Tate said its board has authorized the repurchase
of up to one million of its 25.3 million common shares
outstanding. Ashton-Tate finished unchanged at 6 1/4.
