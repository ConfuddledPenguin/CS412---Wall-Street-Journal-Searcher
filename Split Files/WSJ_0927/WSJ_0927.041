   BONN -- West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
says a priority for the future united-German government must
be to rewrite the constitution to allow the nation to send
armed forces to aid in such places as the Persian Gulf.
   In an interview, the 62-year-old politician also confirmed
that Bonn is negotiating a hefty military aid package for
Turkey, in addition to West Germany's usual military
assistance.

   West Germany has been criticized in the U.S. for dragging
its feet in supporting military operations in the Gulf. This
month, after weeks of domestic wrangling, Bonn committed
itself to a package totaling 3.3 billion marks ($2.1
billion), half to aid U.S. forces and the rest to be divided
as economic aid among Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, the three
nations hurt most by the economic blockade of Iraq. The new
military aid package for Turkey would be separate.
   But even such efforts to deflect criticism have begun to
backfire. The aid package for Turkey, which one West German
news report suggests could be valued at 6.5 billion marks, is
at least partly based on military hardware Bonn will inherit
from East Germany after unification Wednesday. Mr.
Stoltenberg dismisses criticism that Bonn is using the
dissolution of East Germany's military as a convenient source
of aid for other nations.
   Bonn was embarrassed this week by reports, later
confirmed, that much of the equipment it's giving to the U.S.
will also come from East German storehouses. The defense
minister says it isn't decided which goods will come from
East Germany, but he didn't rule out the possibility that as
much as half of the material provided to the U.S. will come
from that former communist nation.
   Mr. Stoltenberg is clearly unhappy with a constitutional
provision that forbids Bonn from sending troops outside the
area of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But he says
there isn't any way around it, short of a constitutional
amendment. "I think this is a weak point. It's
unsatisfactory," he says.
   The issue is too sensitive for the West Germans to tackle
when all thoughts are on unification and united-German
elections in December. Mr. Stoltenberg, a leading member of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, says he
expects a new parliament to deal with the subject early next
year. By then the issue may be moot.
   Mr. Stoltenberg says events in the Middle East have
already taken away much of the euphoria associated with the
end of Europe's East-West confrontation.
   "The Gulf crisis makes very clear . . . that we still have
dangerous centers of tension in the neighborhood of Europe,"
he says. "Islamic fundamentalism, Arabian nationalism, the
buildup of a modern military potential -- including, as we
believe, chemical and biological weapons -- this is a very
dangerous combination and underlines for us the paramount
importance of our Atlantic alliance for the future." Mr.
Stoltenberg says a unified Germany, at least under the
right-of-center Christian Democrats, will remain firmly in
the Western alliance.
   The question is what the alliance will look like. Mr.
Stoltenberg says tighter economic and political links should
make for a stronger "European pillar" in Western defenses.
Indeed, the West German defense minister is unequivocally
pro-U.S. "There is no progress without a strong link between
North America and Western Europe," he says.
   Still, both sides of the Atlantic are getting ready for
deep cuts in European forces. Conventional arms talks between
NATO and what's left of the East's Warsaw Pact are expected
to cut numbers across the board; Germany has pledged to trim
the size of its unified forces to 370,000 within four years.
   But foreign troops stationed on German soil will remain
part of the West's defense equation, says Mr. Stoltenberg.
"We are prepared for a substantial reduction of American
troops in Germany and Central Europe, and I think it will go
beyond those 60,000 who are set to go out in the next few
years," he says, referring to a U.S. plan to shrink the U.S.
presence to 190,000 troops, from the current 250,000.
   "But we believe it's very important, even at a lower
level, to keep substantial U.S. forces in Central Europe,"
says Mr. Stoltenberg, who estimates that total foreign troop
presence in Germany in five years could be 150,000 to
170,000, compared with more than 400,000 today. He opposes
any single nation removing all of its troops, a move he says
would send the wrong signal about the future of the alliance.
   But while he's a firm believer in the alliance, Mr.
Stoltenberg doesn't see NATO expanding to include any of the
new democracies of Eastern Europe. Instead, he foresees an
era in which these nations cooperate with the West on a wide
range of issues through the much looser structure of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a grouping
that brings together East and West European nations, the
U.S., and Canada. Military matters, such as the Middle East,
can be dealt with much more easily in the United Nations, he
says.
