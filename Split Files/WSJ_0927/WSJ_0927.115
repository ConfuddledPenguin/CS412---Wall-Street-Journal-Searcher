   A new congressional report blasts the New York Stock
Exchange specialist system as too restrictive and urges
Congress to push the Securities and Exchange Commission to
re-examine exchange rules.
   The report, to be released today by the congressional
Office of Technology Assessment, doubts the international
competitiveness of the U.S. securities markets unless the SEC
rejects the monopolies created by the Big Board's so-called
Rule 390, which allows only specialists to make markets in
stocks. The issue goes directly to the heart of the Big
Board's trading system, focusing on the market makers who are
the exchange's buyers of last resort.

   Calling Rule 390 "increasingly burdensome" in an age of
global securities trading, the panel suggests the SEC
reconsider a 1979 decision that allowed the rule to continue
in operation. "The SEC has been criticized for this hands-off
attitude toward Rule 390," the report says. "Congress may
soon find it necessary to direct the SEC to reconsider."
   The OTA is a bipartisan investigative body that studies
technological issues for both houses of Congress. Its reports
carry little weight on their own but can force major change
if the ideas are pushed by Congress.
   If the SEC were to repeal Rule 390 -- considered an
unlikely scenario -- any exchange member could become a
market maker in any stock. That, in turn, could create a
system of trading that resembles the over-the-counter
markets. Moreover, it could accelerate electronic,
screen-based trading systems, which some critics of the
status quo say need to be an integral part of 21st century
trading.
   Richard Torrenzano, a spokesman for the Big Board, said
exchange officials hadn't yet seen the report and, therefore,
declined to comment on specifics. However, he said, "The
record of the past couple of years shows that specialists as
dealers have outperformed any other dealer system in the
world."
   He cited the October 1989 stock-market "mini-crash" when
the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points in
slightly more than an hour. At that time, specialists
"continued to trade and maintain fair and orderly markets
when many other markets were either closed or not
accessible," Mr. Torrenzano said.
   The SEC declined to comment.
   The study reopens the issue of the specialist system,
which has perplexed regulators for nearly two decades. In a
1975 hearing about Rule 390, the SEC found such restrictions
"impose burdens on competition" and that these burdens
weren't "necessary or appropriate for protection of
investors." The agency then proposed repealing Rule 390. But
after four years of debate, the commission withdrew its
proposal.
   The report also contends that even recent moves to require
higher capital levels for specialists "will still probably be
inadequate on days when volume peaks and huge order
imbalances appear."
   But specialists rebut that argument. "Specialists' capital
and the ability to stop crashes have nothing to do with each
other," said one market maker. "There isn't enough capital in
the world to stop a crash."
   Another specialist, Robert Fagenson, executive vice
president at Fagenson &amp; Co., said that specialists' capital
has grown since the 1987 crash, whereas overall capital on
Wall Street's trading desks has decreased. Moreover, recent
volatility in the market has "increased the importance of
auction market and agency trading of stocks, such as you find
on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange," he said.
