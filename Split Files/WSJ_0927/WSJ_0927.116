   The French arms and electronics group Thomson CSF reported
that its consolidated profit after payments to minority
interests fell 29% in the first half of 1990 to 1.07 billion
francs ($203 million) from 1.5 billion a year earlier.
   A finance official of the state-controlled group said that
one of the main elements behind the drop was a lower
contribution from minority-held units, essentially in the
finance sector. She said these operations generated only 525
million francs of profit in the first half, down from their
unusually strong year-earlier contribution of 825 million
francs.

   On an operating level, the group's main majority-held
units generated a 19% rise in consolidated revenue to 17.36
billion francs from 14.54 billion.
