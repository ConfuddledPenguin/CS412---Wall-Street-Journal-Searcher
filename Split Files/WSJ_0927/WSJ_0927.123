   LOS ANGELES -- California air-quality regulators today
will consider adopting the toughest smog laws in the country,
requiring automobile makers and oil companies to produce
lower-air-polluting cars and cleaner-burning fuels beginning
in 1994.
   In a two-day session that's being closely watched by the
auto and oil industries, the California Air Resources Board
will rule on proposals that would, among other things:
require car makers to produce electric cars by 1998; set the
nation's first standards for so-called "reformulated"
gasolines; and require gas stations to offer cleaner
alternative fuels, including methanol and compressed natural
gas.

   California, which has more smog than the rest of the
nation combined, is the only state with emissions standards
independent of those set by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency. Observers say the new standards, if
adopted by the Air Resources Board, could lead the way for
the rest of the country.
   But the new standards aren't likely to be adopted without
considerable opposition from businesses interests. "We think
the regulations for low-emissions vehicles are going a little
far," said a spokesman for Chrysler Corp., one of the several
auto makers that will testify at today's hearings. Dixon
Smith, general manager for strategic planning and business
evaluation at Chevron Corp.'s Chevron U.S.A. unit, said, "We
strongly object to the regulations that would mandate
gasoline suppliers sell specific volumes of alternative fuels
whether customers want them or not."
