   DALLAS -- MCorp said it intends to terminate its pension
plan, which covers about 7,000 current and former employees.
   The bank holding company, reorganizing under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, said the pension plan has assets of
about $80 million, or about $10 million more than current
obligations.

   Termination of the pension plan is subject to approval of
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and the Internal Revenue
Service. If the termination is approved, MCorp expects to
begin making distributions in the second half of 1991, a
company spokesman said.
