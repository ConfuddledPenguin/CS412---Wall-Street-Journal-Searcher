   The first two films of Ethan and Joel Coen, "Blood Simple"
and "Raising Arizona," were high-spirited, unrestrained
pieces of whiz-kid virtuosity. The brothers (Joel directing,
Ethan producing) were like a modern-day vaudeville act. You
could almost hear the barker: "And now presenting . . . the
dynamic duo, up from Minneapolis and into Manhattan . . . the
Coen Brothers]"
   Though much praised by many critics and appreciated by
audiences as well, the Coens were criticized in some quarters
for making pictures that were too cartoonish, maybe for
having too much fun. So now they've decided to show that they
are serious fellows, that they are capable of making Art.

   And their new movie, "Miller's Crossing," is artful
indeed. This elegiac gangster movie has some strong writing,
a somber beauty and very good performances all around. But
the Coens seem to have been intent on showing how restrained
they could be, and how deep. They've constructed their
gangsters the way a European who loves American movies (but
who in some fundamental way doesn't really understand them)
might: as brooding creatures with impenetrable psyches whose
every move contains some higher symbolism. In other words,
"Miller's Crossing" is a little pretentious.
   The story revolves around Tommy (Gabriel Byrne), the
enigmatic lieutenant of Leo, the powerful Irish boss in some
unnamed American city, in 1929. The fact that the city is
unnamed may be part of the film's problem. There is a lack of
specificity of detail that makes the picture too much of a
mood piece. There are too many reprises of the image of
Tommy's hat flying through the air, and too little
information about what's happening to whom, when.
   Tommy is a problematic main character because he operates
by keeping everything in. Mr. Byrne has a brooding intensity
but watching him watch everyone, and calculate what to do
next, becomes a little tedious (it doesn't help that Mr.
Byrne's strong Irish accent is somewhat difficult to follow
when he does speak).
   He and Leo have a falling out when Tommy tells Leo they're
involved with the same woman, only Tommy's sleeping with her
and Leo isn't. Tommy takes up with a rival gang, and ends up
setting off a major gang war. The story operates obliquely,
as a series of darkly poetic images that seem to hold a great
deal of significance though it isn't always easy to decipher
what the significance is.
   The woman, Verna, manages to be enigmatic and specific at
the same time. Played by the stage actress Marcia Gay Harden,
who shows enormous promise here in her first film role,
Verna's been hardboiled just the right number of minutes.
   It's Verna's brother Bernie, however, who's the real
catalyst of the action. He's called "shmatta," Yiddish for
rag, and he's the inconsequential little man who can detonate
a war. John Turturro, perpetrator of the amusing caricature
of a Jewish nightclub owner in Spike Lee's "Mo' Better
Blues," runs Bernie through the gamut -- from sniveler to
arrogant conniver, all to great effect.
   Albert Finney's Leo is a compelling figure; a quiet,
courtly man capable of great brutality. But Leo doesn't seem
to get a kick out of it. When he feels he has to inflict pain
it seems to pain him. It's an unpleasant but necessary part
of his job as the main man. Mr. Finney is masterful, as
always, and makes one wish there were more Leo and fewer
hats.

   The gossip columns reported the other day that Katharine
Hepburn didn't care for Clint Eastwood's new film, "White
Hunter, Black Heart." The picture is based on the 1953 Peter
Viertel novel that seemed very much to be the story of John
Huston and the making of "The African Queen," even though Mr.
Viertel said it wasn't.
   It's easy to see why Ms. Hepburn wouldn't like the movie,
since the representation by Marisa Berenson of an actress
called Kay Gibson who appeared to be modeled on Ms. Hepburn
is the weakest of imitations. In fact, we get the impression
that the camera rolled too early and didn't really film the
actors but instead shot the stand-ins used to set the lights
before the actual performers are brought on the set.
   The miscasting started at the top, with Mr. Eastwood
putting himself in the role of Pete Wilson, the compulsive,
arrogant John Huston-like director. Mr. Eastwood gets across
the director's bullheadedness but none of his legendary
charm. His Wilson's a stiff.
   Still, the film is an undeniably compelling portrait of
obsession. Mr. Eastwood's direction, though
characteristically dark, lays the story out with clarity and
intelligence. But the real power lies in the script, which
Mr. Viertel adapted from his book 30 years ago, and which
also was worked on by James Bridges and Burt Kennedy. The
language is tough, smart, sly and cruel. It would have been
great to see John Huston speaking it.

   VIDEO TIP: Peter Viertel accompanied John Huston to Africa
to work with him on the script of "The African Queen" about
two years before "White Hunter, Black Heart" was published.
That book, together with Ms. Hepburn's recent account of the
making of that film, are good preparation for the Huston
movie, which gets better and better with each viewing.
