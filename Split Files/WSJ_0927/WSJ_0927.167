   BUSH IS EXPECTED to request approval for a $7.5 billion
Saudi arms sale.
   The sale would be the first portion of a $20 billion
package that has stirred debate in Washington. Meanwhile, the
U.N. air embargo against Iraq got off to a confused start as
Jordan received Iraqi passenger flights. U.S. officials said
the U.N. might have to clarify the passenger-flight issue. In
Washington, Turkey's Ozal said he would support "armed
intervention" against Iraq, if it becomes necessary, provided
the action is cleared by the U.N. Cheney warned that Saddam
Hussein may try to use military force to break the
"stranglehold" of an international embargo.

   The Soviet parliament formally ended decades of religious
repression, giving overwhelming initial approval to a law on
freedom of conscience. The law forbids the government from
interfering with religious activities, improves the legal
status of religious groups and permits citizens to study
religion in homes and private schools.
                                                                                                       

   Soviet Defense Minister Yazov responded to reports of
suspicious troop movements in the Moscow area, telling

   U.S. consumers pay doctors more than twice as much as
Canadians do for the same amount of health services, a study
said, citing higher fees charged by U.S. doctors. But those
fees don't translate to comparably higher incomes because
U.S. doctors have higher overhead costs and a lighter
workload.

   A group of armed Mohawks surrendered to the Canadian Army,

ending apartheid irreversible.

   An experiment found that women who are more than five
years past menopause need to consume at least 800 milligrams

   Indian students ignored Prime Minister Singh's offer for
talks, and riots spread across northern India to protest a

would rather resign than rescind the policy.

   Tuition increases moderated at private colleges to 8% from
9% last year, a development that analysts said was linked to

   A study revealed that fewer than 10% of U.S. high school

job of teaching reading, mathematics and science than they
were 20 years ago.
