   In mask, gloves and goggles my dentist nears.
   It turns out that it's me he fears.
   All this garb is wise and preventist,
   But what protects me from the dentist?
   -- Margaret Knights Hultsch.

   Some companies get bigger and bigger --
   They buy others and really thrive,
   Until they must get smaller
   In order to survive.
   -- Joshua Adams.
