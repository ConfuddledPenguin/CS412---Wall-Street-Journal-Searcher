   Interstate/Johnson, one of the largest brokerage firms in
the Southeast, has had several quarters of declining revenue
and widening losses. In the quarter ended June 30, the
company had a loss of $1.4 million, or 20 cents a share, on
revenue of $31.9 million. The loss included a $750,000 charge
related to litigation.
   At the time of Mr. Redwine's resignation, the company said
it was reviewing its businesses and options to develop a
"strategic direction."
   Mr. Dalton had been chief executive officer of Interstate
Securities from 1968 to 1986 and chairman through January
1988 before the company's merger with Johnson Lane. In
addition to his position as chairman emeritus at
Interstate/Johnson Lane, Mr. Dalton has served recently as
chairman of the executive committee of the company's board.
