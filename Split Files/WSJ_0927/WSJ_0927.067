   Beijing -- Among the myriad souvenirs of the 11th Asian
Games on sale here are pins showing the jolly panda Panpan
playing Asiad sports. As he moves, Panpan's eyes flash with a
battery-fed red light. Panpan rows, Panpan plays baseball --
and Panpan the sharpshooter wields a rifle. This makes
Beijing residents gasp at what they suppose is a Hong
Kong-produced satire: Panpan as a People's Liberation Army
soldier whose eyes, as the Chinese expression goes, "have
turned red with killing."
   Live pandas, however, seem to share the Beijing public's
generally dim view of the Asian Games, which opened Saturday
and run through Oct. 7. Several months ago, pop singer Hu Yue
sang the official Asian Games tune, "Raise High the Torch of
the Asiad," in the panda cage at Tianjin Zoo. As Ms. Hu
crooned on live television, China's cuddliest creature, who'd
been lying decoratively in the background, rolled almost
imperceptibly forward and sank its fangs into the singer's
leg. The song dissolved in a shriek and the broadcast was
abruptly cut. The Chinese leadership, which is staking more
than half a billion dollars and an incalculable amount of
face on the 16-day spectacle, isn't about to let some
bamboo-muncher spoil the show.

   China has been planning for the Asiad since winning the
bid for the Games in 1986. If all goes well during the Games,
Beijing figures it has a fighting chance of hosting the
Olympics in 2000, a gold-medal event in international
prestige. Since June 4 last year, the preparations have taken
on a fresh urgency. The leadership sees the Asiad as a chance
to undo some of the damage it inflicted on China's image when
it ordered the tanks into Tiananmen Square.
   As a public relations exercise, the Games are aimed at the
right target. Despite ideological differences, Asian
countries -- some of which are in no position to chastise
China on human-rights issues -- have made far fewer official
noises over the violent suppression of the 1989 protest
movement than the West. Despite initial rumblings last year,
not one of the 38 countries invited has boycotted the Games,
though the Olympic Council of Asia voted to exclude Iraq
because of its invasion of Kuwait. (Several American
publications reported that Jordan isn't participating, but
China's Xinhua News Agency could not confirm this.) South
Korea, which does not have diplomatic relations with China,
sent advisers to help work out the logistics. Even Taiwan,
which arguably has more reason to boycott the Games than
anyone else, is participating, sending more than 400 athletes
as its largest overseas athletic delegation ever.
   Beijing has been given a major facelift for the event. In
August, road workers finished resurfacing Changan Avenue to
obliterate the tank treads from last year's violence. In
keeping with the avenue's new look, only vehicles officially
deemed attractive are allowed to cruise along it; Jeeps and
two-seaters have been banned as too downmarket for Beijing's
premier boulevard.
   According to one of the half-dozen books of Asian Games
trivia available here, 2.31 million workers toiled to plant
500,000 trees and 200,000 flowers, and lay down 480,000
square yards of lawn in the new Asian Games Village and
around the stadiums of the northern suburbs alone. They also
cultivated an additional 1.89 million trees, 700,000 flowers
and 2.4 million square yards of lawn in the eight other key
districts.
   Workers also applied fresh paint to buildings and walls
along major arteries in the capital as well as those close to
competition sites. New walls hide homes too ramshackle for
fresh paint to improve.
   Where it's possible that athletes or visitors might stray
into residential buildings, they've been given a touch of
interior redecoration. In one apartment block, workers
spray-painted the entire stairwell white -- including the
windows, the floor and a few bicycles that happened to be
chained to the railings. Foreigners call the result a
Potemkin City. The Chinese expression is earthier: "donkey
turds," meaning something that's shiny on the outside but you
know what in the middle.
   If the people of Beijing do not seem impressed with all
the construction and planting, perhaps that's because they
have to pay for it. Having been told that China's economy is
not doing as well as hoped and that they will have to tighten
their belts, they are not amused that they have been forced
to buy Asiad bonds to help foot the Games' $530 million bill.
   They also have had to put up with a whole slew of
campaigns to beautify the human environment. Parents are
forbidden to carry their children on bicycle handlebars.
Squadrons of citizens have been pressed into "volunteer"
service as traffic controllers, and stiff fines are forcing
Mad Max bicyclists into line. Even toilet attendants have a
mission: Enforce the rule that no more than six mosquitoes
inhabit any public toilet. Police are empowered to fine not
only spitters and litterers but also shop attendants who
don't wear ties. Beijing's surly waiters have been instructed
to be friendly, an order that that does not appear to have
had much effect.
   As an additional measure of preventive social medicine,
mental patients and neighborhood bullies have been put safely
under lock and key. Itinerant provincials have been rounded
up and sent home. The Beijing Housing Service Corporation for
Diplomatic Missions also has put in its oar, issuing
directives asking foreign residents to put their cigarette
stubs in ashtrays, lock their doors when going out and watch
that their children do not play with fire.
   Drivers of the more than 2,500 vehicles commandeered for
official use during the Games had to take special classes in
such subjects as traffic safety and foreign languages. One
taxi driver assigned to the Games happily demonstrated his
method for mastering the latter: "How do you do?" is
remembered as "rats' stomachs have poison" (haodu youdu).
That, he explained, is how you greet people in Japanese.
   The authorities hope that as many as 200,000 tourists will
visit Beijing during the Games. Once they've got them, they
are hitting them up. The Far Eastern Economic Review
estimated that taxi fares would rise almost 70% during the
Games, while already pricey hotel tariffs would rise 35%.
Tourists might feel ripped off, but they should be safe. A
massive anti-crime campaign was launched earlier in the year.
According to Liu Fuzhu, head of the Supreme People's
Procurate, there were 210,000 arrests nationwide between
January and May, a large increase over last year. The law and
order campaign intensified over the summer; Amnesty
International noted with concern that "secret executions have
been extensive."
   The unusually wet summer weather has prompted speculation
that Beijing will be rocked by an earthquake during the
Games, a possibility officially denied in late August by Li
Qinghua, spokesman for the State Seismological Bureau. With
breezy confidence, Mr. Li assured Beijing residents that not
only would no earthquake strike, but that the weather during
the Games would be the finest of the whole year.
   The weather may be the least of the authorities' worries.
They seem to fear that the citizens of Beijing will try to
take their revenge for the massacre of 1989 on the Games of
1990, particularly since the Communist Party has so obviously
staked its prestige on the Asiad. The head of the Chinese
Asian Games committee is, after all, Mayor Chen Xitong,
widely identified with the violent suppression of the 1989
protest movement and subsequent purges. The word in Beijing
is that the workplaces responsible for the distribution of
tickets to the Games have to provide the police with the name
of each person given a ticket together with his or her seat
number. Even the holders of the 200,000 passes issued to
workers, athletes, guests and so on are subject to security
checks each time they enter one of the Games' sites.
   Security measures can prevent sabotage, but not mockery.
"Do you know what `Panpan' {literally `hope hope'} stands
for?" asks one typically cynical Beijing resident. "They hope
the foreigners come, and they hope they bring lots of money
with them."
   Which brings us to another Beijing joke: "What's the
spirit of the Asian Games? Live for today, for there will be
no tomorrow."
