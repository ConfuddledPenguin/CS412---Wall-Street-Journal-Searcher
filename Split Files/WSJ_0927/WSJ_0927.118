   Dana Corp. of Toledo, Ohio, said it was taking a $10
million charge to increase the loan-loss reserves of its
Diamond Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary.
   The action will decrease Dana's earnings for the first
nine months by about 12%, the company said. That indicates
that the company expected to earn roughly $83 million for the
first nine months before the charge and now expects to earn
about $73 million. For the first three quarters of 1989, Dana
earned $111.4 million, or $2.73 a share.

   Despite the charge, Dana Chairman Southwood J. Morcott
said he was "pleased with our operating performance given
these turbulent times."
   In addition, Dana said it might have to inject up to $33
million in additional capital over the next year into Diamond
to cause it to exceed all of the increased regulatory capital
requirements. This action would have no effect on Dana's
profits, said Robert Richter, Dana's controller. Mr. Richter
noted that Diamond could take several other steps to meet the
capital requirements, and that the injection of capital was a
last resort.
