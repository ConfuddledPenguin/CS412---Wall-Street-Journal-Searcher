   LOS ANGELES -- First Capital Holdings Corp. said its board
authorized the purchase of as much as $20 million of the $120
million outstanding of its 13% senior subordinated
debentures, due 1999. The financial services holding company
said it considers its stock and its publicly traded debt
undervalued.
