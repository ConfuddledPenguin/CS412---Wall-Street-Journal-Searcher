   Warner-Lambert Co. said it signed a three-year contract
with the state of California to provide four additional
prescription drugs at discounts to Medi-Cal patients.
   Warner-Lambert's action follows similar moves by Merck &amp;
Co. and other drug makers in response to state and federal
pressure to cut health-care costs.

   Pharmaceutical companies previously had been offering
discounts on brand-name drugs only to big-volume purchasers,
such as hospitals. But budget deficits and rising
prescription-drug prices have led legislators to look for
ways to control costs of state and federal health-care
programs. That has put pressure on drug manufacturers to cut
prices, in order to keep their drugs on the state and
federally approved lists.
   Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said the
agreement with California covers four drugs made by its
Parke-Davis unit. They are lipid-regulating Lopid, oral
contraceptives Loestrin and Norlestrin and anti-anginal
Nitrostat. The company declined to disclose terms of the
agreement.
