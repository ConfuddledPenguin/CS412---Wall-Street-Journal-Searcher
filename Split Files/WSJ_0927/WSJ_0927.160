   A federal judge said General Electric Co. hid serious
doubts about its design of a giant nuclear-containment vessel
for a Washington Public Power Supply System
electricity-generating plant, in what he called an
"unconscionable" breach of GE's "duty of good faith and fair
dealing."
   The ruling removes a limitation of damages of about $110
million under terms of the 1971 contract covering WPPSS's No.
2 plant near Richland, Wash. It conceivably could also expose
General Electric to further litigation involving some of the
dozen plants in the U.S. where similar boiling-water reactor
designs are used.

   Judge Alan A. McDonald had sealed his ruling last June to
avoid causing bias in the jury that was due to consider a
$1.2 billion WPPSS suit accusing General Electric of fraud
and breach of contract.
   When the 10-member jury split in July and a mistrial was
declared in the case, tried in Phoenix, Ariz., the judge's
ruling remained sealed on the issue of whether General
Electric's liability under the contract terms should remain
capped.
   The ruling was unsealed yesterday by Judge McDonald in
Spokane, Wash., however, at the request of The Wall Street
Journal and of Clearing Up, a Seattle-based energy industry
newsletter.
   WPPSS has requested a new trial before Judge McDonald,
without a jury, on the broader issues of General Electric's
liability in the case. A spokesman for the utility called the
judge's wording "quite damning," and said the ruling "shows
that we were correct and prudent in investing five years of
effort in the case." He particularly noted that the judge
described some testimony by GE personnel as "forced,
sometimes forlorn and sometimes incredible."
   The judge said that "key personnel within {GE} were aware
of the existence of a number of serious, unresolved
questions" about the nuclear-containment system, but added
that "testing sufficient to resolve those questions wasn't
conducted" before the contract was signed.
   The judge, at General Electric's request, also released a
"special verdict form" showing eight jurors had voted that
the company hadn't "committed either fraudulent
misrepresentation or fraudulent omission" in dealing with
WPPSS. That vote, however, wouldn't be part of any new trial,
while Judge McDonald's removal of the cap on GE's liability
would be expected to remain in force.
   The judge used harsh language in critizing General
Electric for withholding from WPPSS "any doubts or questions
about the adequacy of its pressure-suppression system" in
negotiating the contract. The system, within the thick
concrete containment-vessel enclosure, is designed to prevent
the escape of radiation following a nuclear accident.
   Responding to Judge McDonald's ruling, a spokesman for GE,
based in Fairfield, Conn., said: "GE disagrees with the
court's ruling, believing it was an issue for the jury and
not the judge. We would have challenged it if there was a
need to do so. We believe it has no binding effect."
   "The outcome of the exhaustive five-month trial
convincingly shows that {the} WPPSS charges are without
merit," the spokesman added.
   Several other utilities with nuclear reactors and
containment vessels designed by General Electric have closely
watched the WPPSS case. Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. and
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. sent attorneys to observe
parts of the Arizona trial. General Electric has said that
the only similar lawsuit against it has been a $600 million
action filed by Long Island Lighting Co., owner of the
Shoreham nuclear plant in Brookhaven, N.Y. Jury selection for
the trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 5.
   The judge characterized as "a fairly sophisticated form of
Russian roulette" the comments of one witness who "pointed
with pride to the several start-ups as constituting a
full-scale test."
   Listing several internal company documents showing
problems that could crop up with the containment design,
Judge McDonald said: "General Electric knew these problems
should be examined but decided to adopt only an analytical
approach, because the full-scale tests required to prove that
the phenomena would not occur in its then present containment
design would be, I am quoting from the documents, `very
expensive.'"
   A "most telling piece of evidence," the judge said, was
one August 1968 company memorandum mentioning the need for "a
full-scale test" to answer one design question. There wasn't
any evidence presented to show the test was conducted, Judge
McDonald said, adding: "General Electric's witnesses to
explain this document were not believable."
   Other GE documents he cited, dating back to 1958, showed
that the company "was aware of certain phenomena that could
occur as a result of the normal or accidental operation" of
the system. A May 1958 preliminary test result that was cited
considered a containment-vessel phenomenon called "water
hammer," resulting from the collapse of steam bubbles. Water
hammer wasn't a problem in low-steam rates used in the test,
the document said. But it added that "it cannot be safely
concluded" that a full-scale steam discharge wouldn't "create
shock waves or forces which could be damaging," yet wouldn't
show up in the small-scale tests.
   WPPSS's claims against General Electric in the suit it
filed in 1985 aren't related to the 1983 default by the
utility on $2.25 billion of bonds issued for construction of
its nuclear units Nos. 4 and 5. Those units were abandoned
after being partially built.
