   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it may seek bankruptcy
court protection if bondholders don't approve by Oct. 22 a
debt-swap offer needed to complete a $430 million bailout by
the company's Japanese partners.
   The bankruptcy threat came as part of an announcement that
the debt-swap offer, which was to expire at midnight Tuesday,
would be extended for a fourth time, to Oct. 22, as well as
sweetened in a way designed to attract minority holders.

   Ito-Yokado Co., operator of the company's 7-Eleven stores
in Japan, also extended to Oct. 22 its offer to buy 70% of
Southland for $430 million, cash desperately needed by the
debt-laden convenience store operators.
   To complete the bailout, Southland needs tenders from
bondholders representing 95% of each of five classes of
notes. But Tuesday night it remained far short of that.
Approvals from one class, the 16.75% notes, remained as low
as 45.6%.
   To get around the 95% approval requirement, Southland said
it is considering filing a prepackaged bankruptcy plan. In
such a case, a company enters court with a reorganization
plan already approved by 50% of its bondholders representing
at least two-thirds of its debt. If the court approves the
plan, minority holdouts are legally bound to it.
   Southland predicted that it could complete a prepackaged
bankruptcy within six months. It also said that Ito-Yokado
"presently" was willing to consummate its bailout "within the
context of a prepackaged reorganization," if necessary.
   Southland said it amended the debt-swap offer to include a
cash-election option for holders of less than $300,000 of its
notes. The option gives such holders the right to trade their
existing notes for cash instead of new debt. For instance,
for each $1,000 principal amount of Southland 16.50% notes, a
holder could receive $227.87 in cash. Such holders would
still participate in the proposed transfer of 25% of
Southland common stock to bondholders. Observers say the cash
option is designed to bring hard-to-find minority holders out
of the woodwork.
   In July Southland, operator of about 6,700 7-Eleven and
other convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went into
default on debt taken on in its $4.9 billion 1987 leveraged
buy-out. Under its proposed bailout plan, Ito-Yokado would
get 75% of the company, bondholders would get 25% and the
founding Thompson family of Dallas would see its stake shrink
to 5%.
