   Ted Turner got to keep his Goodwill Games.
   The board of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. yesterday
voted unanimously to hold a third Goodwill Games in Leningrad
and Moscow in 1994, and to sell broadcast rights to about 20%
of the games to ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Terms
weren't disclosed.

   Turner Broadcasting, based in Atlanta, will air the rest
of the games on its cable networks, and -- unlike this year's
event -- it won't charge cable operators any special
surcharges to carry the games.
   The first two quadrennial games, in Moscow in 1986 and in
Seattle this summer, had losses totaling $70 million, so
approval by the large cable operators that control Turner
Broadcasting's board wasn't certain. But executives close to
the company said Mr. Turner was insistent that the games go
on, and the cable operators on the board, who were no longer
being asked to shoulder special carriage fees, relented.
   Mr. Turner said in a statement, "We are confident {that
the games} will only grow in stature during the next decade."
   Jack Kelly, president of the Goodwill Games, said ABC will
broadcast, on three consecutive weekends, a total of 15 to 18
hours of the 21-day event. That leaves Turner Broadcasting
with about 70 hours of programming on weekdays and weekend
evenings. No decision has been made whether Turner
Broadcasting will show the games on its Turner Network
Television channel or its superstation WTBS.
   Mr. Kelly said ABC and Turner Broadcasting will share the
premier events, like track and basketball, and the
less-glamorous sports, like judo and team handball.
   Though Mr. Kelly said the ABC pact is still being worked
out, an executive close to both companies said ABC had
offered Turner Broadcasting $20 million, plus production
expenses, to air virtually the same package -- including
three Saturday evenings -- for the Seattle games. But Turner
Broadcasting's board rejected the offer, because it wanted to
keep the games as a cable-TV exclusive, this executive said.
   The change of heart seems to have been motivated by the
games' large losses. Mr. Kelly said exposure on ABC will help
give the games more publicity -- a critical problem this
year. He said the board asked for "very conservative"
financial estimates for the 1994 games, and he obliged: His
budget of $70 million to $80 million is about 20% smaller
than the one for this year's games.
   "We've put together a business plan that doesn't show
anywhere near" the past losses, Mr. Kelly said.
   For ABC, the Goodwill Games will provide sports
programming -- albeit briefly -- for the dog days of
midsummer, when, except for baseball, the networks don't have
much to highlight on weekend afternoons. And despite the
first two games' disappointing ratings, Dennis Swanson,
president of ABC Sports, said "We're excited about. . .
having an event of its caliber as part of our 1994
programming line-up."
