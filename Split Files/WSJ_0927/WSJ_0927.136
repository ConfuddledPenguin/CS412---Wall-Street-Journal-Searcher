   The Resolution Trust Corp. has good news for holders of
certain securities secured by now-bankrupt thrifts: Interest
on bonds backed by letters of credit redeemed early by the
RTC will be paid up to the time the securities are redeemed.
   The RTC has the power to repudiate bonds issued or secured
by now-insolvent thrifts, and redeem or "call" them early.
When this happens, the RTC says it will prepay "an amount
equal to the outstanding principal amount or accreted value
of the secured obligations."

   Last April the RTC adopted a policy of paying interest up
to the time the bonds were repudiated, and not just up to the
date that the thrift was taken over. But it left unclear
whether it would do the same for bonds secured by
"collateralized letters of credit" issued by the busted
thrifts. Because of this, holders of those securities worried
about the possibility of losing months' worth of interest if
the bonds were called.
   About $840 million of collaterized letters of credit were
issued by thrifts currently in conservatorship, estimates
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. In most cases, the letters of credit
were issued by thrifts to secure tax-exempt bonds issued by
local housing agencies and sold to individual investors, says
S&amp;P's Francis Parisi.
