   An anonymous Manhattan writer quoted in the July 7 issue
of the New York Times:

   "If you have a plain Christmas creche, it violates the
First Amendment to pay for it with taxpayers' money. But if
an artist submerges the entire Christmas creche in urine, it
violates the First Amendment to forbid paying for it with
taxpayers' money."
