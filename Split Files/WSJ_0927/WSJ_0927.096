   WASHINGTON -- Rockwell International Corp. and
Westinghouse Electric Corp. said they agreed to work together
on the development of a nuclear thermal propulsion system for
use in the government's Space Exploration Initiative.
   The SEI is a plan for manned and unmanned lunar and Mars
missions. A nuclear thermal propulsion system would use the
heat from a nuclear fission reactor to raise the temperature
of a gas propellant, increasing the speed of a rocket.

   The two companies said they plan to define and pursue
technologies that will lead to the evaluation and application
of a nuclear thermal propulsion system.
   Rockwell applies advanced technology for products in the
electronics, aerospace and automotive and graphics
businesses. Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, is a
diversified technology company with interests in the nuclear
power industry.
