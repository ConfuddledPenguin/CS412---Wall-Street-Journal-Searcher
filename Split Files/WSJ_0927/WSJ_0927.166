   TOKYO -- The Japanese stock market's prolonged decline
accelerated to a drop of nearly 5% Wednesday, with Mideast
tensions apparently playing a significant, direct role.
   Meanwhile, London shares edged up, as prices lost earlier
gains following a sharp drop on Wall Street in late London
trading.

   For weeks, investors have blamed the sagging Tokyo stock
market on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the subsequent surge in
oil prices is tough on Japan, which imports almost all of its
energy. Wednesday, however, the investors were blaming Kuwait
itself as the Nikkei Index of 225 stocks plunged 1108.70
points, or 4.75%, to 22250.62.
   In trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell
another 222.75 points to close the morning session at
22027.87.
   "Kuwait was really selling" stock, said a salesman at
Nomura Securities Co. A British fund manager put the amount
at 30 billion yen ($219.3 million), spread over Tuesday and
Wednesday. Although government officials have said Kuwait's
government-in-exile has "tens of billions" of dollars in
Japanese stock and bond investments, the selling couldn't be
confirmed.
   "We don't discuss our investments," said a spokeswoman for
the London-based Kuwait Investment Office, the main
investment manager for the exiled Kuwaiti government.
   But the Japanese traders' reports appear to conflict with
Kuwaiti policy announced Friday by Sheik Ali al-Khalifa
al-Sabah, the exiled Kuwait finance minister. At a news
conference, Sheik Ali indicated that his government won't be
selling gold or stocks; instead, he said it will get needed
cash from its own cash reserves and from sales of short-term
market instruments "in various currencies." On Monday,
however, the KIO confirmed that as part of its normal
stock-trading operations it sold a #60 million ($112.2
million) stake in Britain's Mount Charlotte Investments PLC.
   In combination with fresh worries about an outbreak of war
in the Middle East and heavy arbitrage-related selling,
though, the rumors were enough to scotch a rally Wednesday
morning on Tokyo's stock market and batter share prices in
their ninth-biggest single-day decline ever and to their
lowest level in 32 months. The decline compounded a
418.51-point loss Tuesday. The benchmark Nikkei Index now is
off nearly 43% since its record finish of 38915.87 at the end
of 1989.
   Volume remained light at an estimated 350 million shares,
up from 252.6 million shares Tuesday. Some brokers said the
thin trading suggests the market has more room to fall.
"There has to be a certain amount of panic selling before the
market will reach its bottom," a Japanese analyst said.
   Losers widely outnumbered advancers 919 to 54, while 73
issues were unchanged.
   The composite Tokyo Stock Price Index of issues listed on
the first section dropped 67.92 points, or 3.95%, to 1651.44.
   The second section index fell 85.72 points, or 2.61%, to
3194.45. Volume in the section was estimated at five million
shares, up from 3.8 million shares Tuesday.
   On Wednesday, the market opened relatively strongly,
following upswings on Wall Street and in London. But a
Japanese news service report that interpreted remarks by U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker as suggesting that open
conflict with Iraq might be imminent triggered a bout of
selling, which was exacerbated by reports Kuwait was dumping
stock, too. The effect was to unleash a wave of selling.
   "The market is still very shaky," said Hank Sawa, a
strategist for Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd. Even
if there is a technical rebound to Wednesday's drop, he
predicts the market won't touch bottom until the Nikkei Index
hits the psychologically important 20000-point level. If it
falls below 20000, there's no telling where it could stop,
analysts say.
   In large part, that's because of computerized selling
programs. When the market fell below 23000 points Wednesday,
for instance, stop-loss orders by major institutional clients
quickened the pace of selling and rapidly drove the index
down to its closing level.
   That selling exacerbates pressure on individual investors,
who often have borrowed money to buy stocks on margin. They
put up only a small amount of cash, and brokers rely on the
stock they buy as collateral for the rest. If stock prices
fall, the investors have to put up more cash.
   With interest rates rising -- banks plan to raise their
long-term prime lending rate to 8.9% from 8.5% now -- the
need for investors to sell stock to raise cash is increasing,
analysts said.
   Even big corporate news wasn't enough to salvage the
market. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. dropped 70 yen to
1560 yen, despite its confirmation that it is holding talks
about acquiring U.S. film studio MCA Inc. And robot-maker
Fanuc Ltd. dropped 270 yen to 4800 after the company
announced plans to triple production at a new plant to keep
up with strong demand.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share
Index ended up 0.8 point at 2000, under the day's high of
2015.8. The Financial Times 30 Share Index closed up 6 points
at 1532.6. Volume was 410.3 million shares, compared with
412.4 million shares Tuesday.
   Although London remained firm for most of the day, and
comfortably above the 2000 level, traders had warned that a
marked decline on Wall Street would trigger a similar
reaction in London.
   "New York has held up better than London. The recession
there has not been fully appreciated by the U.S. market," one
trader said, adding that Wall Street eventually would fall
lower, bringing London down with it.
   Another poor day on the German stock market, which Tuesday
ended at a 16-month low, also diminished investor confidence
in London, traders said.
   While volume remained thin, traders said that institutions
were picking up small amounts of stock at the lower end of
the market. "This is hardly an expression of confidence in
the market," one trader said. "Institutions are only going to
commit {significant funds} to a rising market," another
trader added.
   The property sector had a strong day. Traders said there
was little turnover in the sector, and prices were simply
being squeezed higher from a shortage of stock. Traders added
that there was a general trend toward interest-rate sensitive
stocks that could stage a fast recovery when U.K. interest
rates eventually fall.
   MEPC PLC, the U.K. property investment and development
group, closed 8 pence higher at 428 pence, while Land
Securities gained 11 pence to 460 pence.
   Leisure industry group Brent Walker finished 7 pence
higher at 144 pence. The company has said its interim results
due Thursday will be in line with expectations, and the
market is generally optimistic, traders said.
   Advertising group WPP Group ended 46 pence lower at 369
pence. Traders said the fall was in line with the rest of the
advertising sector, but was accentuated by reports that WPP
client National Westminster Bank was reconsidering its
advertising strategy. A spokesman for the bank said he
couldn't confirm the reports.
   Profit-taking in the oil sector led to an easing of prices
in that sector, traders said. British Petroleum closed 7
pence lower at 353 pence, and Shell fell 10 pence to 457
pence.
   Associated British Foods, which Wednesday received
clearance from the U.K.'s Department of Trade and Industry to
put forward a proposal to buy assets of Berisford
International, saw its shares end 9 pence higher at 404
pence. Berisford closed 4 pence higher at 36 pence.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Brussels; lower in Stockholm, Helsinki, Oslo, Madrid; and
mixed in Zurich, Amsterdam and Milan. South African gold
stocks closed narrowly mixed.
   Share prices also closed mixed in Seoul, lower in
Wellington, Manila, Taipei, Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney.
