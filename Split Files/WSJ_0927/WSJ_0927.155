   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, giving the first
glimpse into its long-awaited plan to revamp deposit
insurance and the banking and thrift industries, said it
favors substantially shifting risk from the taxpayer to the
banks and depositors.
   Banks and thrifts would pay insurance premiums based on
the amount of their lending risk, would transfer riskier
activities to uninsured affiliates, and would tighten
underwriting standards for real estate loans. Depositors
would be limited to a particular number of insured accounts,
and pension funds and other big depositors would face limited
insurance coverage.

   Robert Glauber, undersecretary of the Treasury,
characterized his testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee as a "progress report" on the Bush administration's
deposit-insurance study. Nonetheless, "there are a number of
specific areas where we have begun to lean towards specific
conclusions," he said.
   The complex issue has been pushed to the front burner in
Congress by outrage over the savings-and-loan bailout, and
anxiety over the strained bank insurance fund. There is an
increasing appetite on Capitol Hill to tackle deposit
insurance and bank activities in one big legislative package
early next year.
   "We have to put this on the fast track, and clear the
track," said Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D.,
Mich.). He said Congress is awaiting a signal from President
Bush that the issue will be a priority next year. "If he is
willing to engage, we can really move this along," Sen.
Riegle said.
   The plan didn't specifically address some problematic
questions, such as whether to abandon the "too big to fail"
doctrine. Under that practice, banking regulators have
insured all deposits at large, failed banks, even accounts
that exceed the $100,000 deposit-insurance limit.
   Even that policy appears headed for revision. Both Sen.
Riegle and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of the
House Banking Committee, have opposed protecting all
depositors at large banks. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman
William Seidman have both expressed uneasiness with it.
   "That's very important for shaping the rest of the
deposit-insurance reform proposals," said Robert Dugger,
economist for the American Bankers Association. For one,
changing that policy would help make small banks more
competitive with large banks, which alone benefit from the
too big to fail policy.
   The administration is keeping mum on how it would carry
out its other ideas. Those matters, such as which bank powers
would be restricted to affiliates, and how to keep track of
the number of insured accounts, are relegated to the
full-blown study on deposit insurance.
   But altering those practices would change the industry
radically. Investment managers are already bracing themselves
for a narrowing of coverage for big pension funds, which are
currently protected up to $100,000 for each beneficiary.
Those deposits are likely to flee to insurance companies,
which sell competing instruments. "We anticipate some sort of
curtailment on exisiting coverage," said Steve Finegan of
Morley Capital Management, an investment manager.
   Shifting riskier loans to affiliates and subsidiaries
would probably cause an industry contraction -- at least in
the banking sector operating with deposit insurance. The
administration thinks that would be fine. "The problem is
that the amount of funds attracted into the banking system
may be far greater than the amount that can be deployed
wisely in traditional banking assets," Mr. Glauber said.
   Also, interest rates on loans generated at the banking
affiliates are likely to rise above current rates, because
they will be funded from higher-cost sources than bank
deposits.
   Overall, lawmakers and industry lobbyists were somewhat
surprised at how easily a general consensus appears to be
forming. "I'm really pleased to see things are further
advanced than I thought they would be even a month ago," said
Lee Peckarsky, a lobbyist for the National Council of Savings
Institutions. "To the extent that Congress focuses on this in
September, it sets the agenda for an early January start."
   Meanwhile, however, both Congress and the administration
refuse to propose specific funding for the savings-and-loan
cleanup, which will run out of cash by the end of the year.
The agency needs at least $20 billion to get through next
April, or else insolvent thrifts will remain open and
accumulate losses. The Treasury has drafted legislation for
three different funding proposals, but Congress is waiting
for the Treasury to endorse one.
   Mr. Glauber said any choice is fine. "There is no
ambiguity," said Mr. Glauber. "We need money before Congress
goes out."
   He also urged Congress to quickly pass legislation
removing the ceiling on deposit-insurance premiums and giving
regulators greater flexibility with the insurance fund. The
House has already passed a version of this legislation.
