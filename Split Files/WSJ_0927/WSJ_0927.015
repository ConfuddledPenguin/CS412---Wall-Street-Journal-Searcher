   Women who are more than five years past menopause need to
take in at least 800 milligrams of calcium a day to keep
their bone loss at a minimum, an experiment with more than
300 women found.
   Researchers said that calcium-rich foods, such as dairy
products, were the best way to boost calcium consumption. But
the experiment also found that a patented form of calcium
that Procter &amp; Gamble Co. puts into its Citrus Hill Plus
Calcium orange and grapefruit juices might be a better source
of calcium supplement than calcium carbonate tablets.

   The experiment, reported in this week's New England
Journal of Medicine, was done by researchers at the
Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center
on Aging, located at Tufts University in Boston.
   The major portion of the $1 million-plus cost of the
experiment was borne by the Agriculture Department, said Bess
Dawson-Hughes, the nutrition scientist who headed the study.
But, Dr. Dawson-Hughes said, the scientists also sought and
received funding and supplies from Procter &amp; Gamble.
   Dr. Dawson-Hughes said the experiment was launched to find
out if increasing calcium intake would have any effect on the
loss of bone that women experience after menopause. This bone
loss can lead to osteoporosis, in which the weakened bones of
older women tend to fracture.
   The researchers recruited 361 women over age 50 from the
Boston area; half of the women regularly ate diets that
contained less than 400 milligrams of calcium a day, while
the other half regularly ate diets higher in calcium.
   The women were asked to take two white tablets a day while
continuing their regular diet. For a third of the women, the
tablets were placebos made of inert cellulose. For another
third the tablets were calcium carbonate, sometimes called
oyster shell calcium, which is the most common form of
calcium supplement. Among the dozens of brands of calcium
carbonate are Os-Cal from Marion Laboratories Inc., a unit of
Dow Chemical Co., and Caltrate from the Lederele division of
American Cyanamid Co.
   The remaining third of the women took tablets of calcium
citrate maleate, Procter &amp; Gamble's patented compound which
is available commercially only in the company's Citrus Hill
juices. The Procter &amp; Gamble product was included in the
experiment because earlier studies showed it is more readily
absorbed into the blood than calcium carbonate, Dr.
Dawson-Hughes said.
   The calcium supplements had little or no effect in many of
the women. Periodic measurements of the density of the spine,
forearm and hip bones, for example, showed that the bone loss
that occurs in the first five years after menopause wasn't
stemmed by the calcium supplements. Similarly, women who
regularly consumed more than 400 milligrams of calcium in
their daily diet showed little benefit of the calcium
tablets.
   But in women who were more than five years past menopause
and who were habitually eating a low-calcium diet, the
calcium tablets did slow the rate of bone loss, the
researchers said. Both types of calcium slowed the thinning
of the hip and forearm bones. But only the Procter &amp; Gamble
calcium slowed the loss of bone from the spine, they
reported.
   National nutrition surveys indicate that nearly half the
women in the U.S. consume less than 500 milligrams of calcium
daily compared with the recommended consumption of 800
milligrams.
