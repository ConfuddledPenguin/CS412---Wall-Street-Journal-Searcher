   Gradco Systems Inc. said it will explore the possibility
of spinning off its printer products business to
shareholders.
   The Irvine, Calif., company said the plan would divide its
more profitable copier products business, based in Japan, and
printer products operations into two publicly traded
companies. Printer products contributed about 25% of Gradco's
$90 million in revenue last year, a spokesman said. For the
year ended March 31, Gradco had a loss of $28.1 million,
including a $23 million charge for restructuring and
consolidation of operations.

   Gradco said that the businesses' different development
cycles and risk profiles have confused investors, and that
separating them would "focus market attention" on the
potential of each and maximize share value. Gradco said it is
reviewing the feasibility of the plan, including any possible
tax consequences. It said it won't adopt or implement any
definitive plan before the annual meeting, adjourned earlier
this month, reconvenes Oct. 12.
