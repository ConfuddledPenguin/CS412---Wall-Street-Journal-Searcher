   Investors continued to put cash into taxable money-market
mutual funds as yields edged up fractionally.
   Assets of 483 taxable funds rose by $789.4 million in the
week ended Tuesday, to $402.1 billion, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The average seven-day
compound yield, which assumes reinvestment of dividends,
inched up to 7.75% from 7.74%, the Holliston, Mass.,
newsletter reported.

   There's no indication yields are likely to change much
anytime soon. Average maturity of the funds' investments,
including Treasury bills, short-term corporate debt and bank
certificates of deposit, remained unchanged at a fairly long
46 days.
   Meanwhile, Dreyfus Corp. announced a change that will
slightly reduce the yield on its top-yielding Dreyfus
Worldwide Dollar fund. Effective Monday, Dreyfus said it will
begin allocating to the fund operating expenses equal to
0.05% of assets. In the latest week, the fund's seven-day
compound yield was 8.60%.
   Dreyfus had been absorbing all management fees and
operating expenses since Worldwide Dollar began operating in
February 1989 as a way of boosting yield. It has attracted
nearly $9 billion in assets in its 19 months of operations.
   Based on the latest data from Donoghue's, Dreyfus would
still be the top fund even if its yield were reduced by 0.05
percentage point. The No. 2 fund, Alger Money Market
Portfolio, had a seven-day compound yield of 8.51% in the
latest week. Six of the top 10 taxable funds, including
Alger, are absorbing all or part of their fees and expenses,
according to Donoghue's.
   Dreyfus advertising has stressed that it will continue to
absorb all "management" fees, equal to 0.5% of assets, at
least through June 1991. But it has also reserved the right
to gradually begin allocating "operating" expenses to the
fund. Current operating expenses of the fund, which include
such things as registration costs and custodial fees, are
equal to 0.24% of assets, according to Dreyfus.
   The average "expense ratio" for money funds, which
includes operating expenses and management fees, is 0.65% of
assets, said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's. If fully
passed on to investors, Worldwide Dollar's expense ratio
would total 0.74%.
   The Donoghue's newsletter, which reports money fund yields
and assets weekly, said the average seven-day simple yield of
the taxable funds edged up to 7.47% from 7.46% in the latest
week. The average 30-day simple yield remained at 7.47% and
the average 30-day compound yield stayed at 7.75%. Total
assets for the week ended Sept. 18 were adjusted to $401.4
billion because of an inaccurate report from one fund last
week, Donoghue's said.
   Assets of the 234 tax-exempt money funds tracked by
Donoghue's fell by $449.4 million to $80.4 billion in the
latest week, while yields rose. The average seven-day
compound yield of the tax-free funds, for instance, jumped to
5.65% from 5.56%. The latest yield is equal to a taxable
yield of 7.85% for investors in the 28% tax bracket and 8.43%
for someone paying 33%.
   Average maturity of the tax-free funds' investments
shortened by two days to 57 days.
