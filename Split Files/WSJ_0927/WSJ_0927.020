   TULSA, Okla. -- T/SF Communications Corp. said it expects
to report a slight loss for 1990, based on losses in the
first six months and expectations that net income for the
second half will be the same as or only slightly better than
a year earlier.
   The communications company reported losses of $436,000 on
revenue of $22.6 million for the first six months of this
year. For all of 1989, the company reported net income of
$325,000 on revenue of $74.3 million.

   Separately, the company said its board authorized the
repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of its common stock in a
"Dutch auction." Under the plan, shareholders could offer to
sell their stock back to the company at a price specified by
the tendering shareholder, subject to the company's agreement
to the offered price.
   The company said its projections contradict those of some
analysts who had forecast better earnings for the second half
of this year.
   In a statement, Chairman G. Douglas Fox attributed the
expected results to continuing problems in the commercial
printing division of the company's shopper-newspaper
operation in New Jersey.
   "Continued softening of the economy in the Northeast is
contributing to our current problems in New Jersey and New
York," Mr. Fox said. "Our daily newspaper, information
services and trade journal divisions are doing well and will
likely complete the year with substantial improvement from
1989."
