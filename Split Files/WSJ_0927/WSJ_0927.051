   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. -- Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc. was
barred by the Defense Logistics Agency from contracting with
the federal government until Aug. 31, 1992.
   The move affects Quad, based in Indianapolis, but not its
parent, Par Pharmaceutical Inc.

   Par and Quad were fined earlier this year for illegal
payments to a Food and Drug Administration official. Both
have recalled products amid charges that they changed
manufacturing processes without following FDA requirements.
The action against Quad follows a two-year investigation of
the company.
   "While Quad is of course disappointed in this decision, we
look forward to the time when we can demonstrate that we are
responsible to do business with the federal government," said
Kenneth I. Sawyer, president of Par.
