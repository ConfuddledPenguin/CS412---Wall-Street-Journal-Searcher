   WASHINGTON -- President Bush formally notified Congress
that the administration plans to begin negotiating a
free-trade agreement with Mexico, administration officials
said.
   Under U.S. trade laws, the Senate Finance Committee and
the House Ways and Means Committee now have 60 legislative
days to decide whether to allow the negotiations to occur
under "fast-track" procedures. Fast-track authorization is
considered crucial because it prohibits amendments and so
helps prevent any proposed accord from getting bogged down in
Congress.

   Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said a
U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement "may offer both countries
important economic opportunities." But he added that it is
"critical any free-trade negotiations be analyzed and then
managed carefully," particularly in light of the significant
economic disparties between the U.S. and Mexico.
   In Montreal, Mexican Minister of Industry and Commerce
Jaime Serra said Mexico is seeking a pact that is "similar
but not necessarily the same" as the existing U.S.-Canada
free-trade agreement. Canada has indicated it wants to join
the U.S.-Mexico talks, and Mr. Serra said it is "very likely"
that talks among the three countries will result in a
comprehensive North American free-trade agreement. But he
conceded, "it will be a difficult exercise."
   Mr. Serra and Chilean Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley
agreed recently that their two countries would work to remove
all tariff barriers between them within five years, Mr.
Foxley said in an interview. President Bush is encouraging a
western hemisphere-wide free-trade area.
