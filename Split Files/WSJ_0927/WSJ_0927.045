   NEW YORK -- The government, as expected, urged a federal
judge to sentence Michael Milken to a "substantial" prison
term for six securities-related crimes to which he pleaded
guilty in April.
   The government specifically urged that Mr. Milken get more
than the three-year sentence received by Ivan F. Boesky, the
convicted former stock speculator who cooperated with the
government's investigation of insider trading and other
securities crimes.

   Meanwhile, lawyers for Mr. Milken acknowledged that he
engaged in a dozen additional transactions -- to which he did
not plead guilty -- that furthered an illegal conspiracy with
Mr. Boesky.
   The admission came in response to an order from U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood that the attorneys provide
additional information about Mr. Milken's activities with Mr.
Boesky. Mr. Milken, the former junk-bond chief at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge
Wood on Monday.
   In a sentencing memo made public on Tuesday, Mr. Milken's
lawyers urged Judge Wood to sentence Mr. Milken to community
service, saying he was a decent and charitable man who was
remorseful about any wrongs he had committed.
   In contrast, the government's memo depicted Mr. Milken as
a man who systematically used his firm's junk-bond
department, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., to pursue his
illegal activity. According to the memo, the department
became "the means through which Milken rewarded his friends,
defeated his rivals and committed his crimes." Mr. Milken's
objectives, the government said, "were simple: power and
wealth."
   Although Mr. Milken's lawyers have said that he intends to
cooperate with the government after he is sentenced, the
government indicated that it has doubts about Mr. Milken's
willingness to do so.
   "Our confidence in Milken's intention to be truthful and
forthcoming has waned," the memo stated, because "nothing
about Milken's conduct to date suggests the contrition or
remorse that often predicts sincere cooperation by a
defendant."
   One of the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty last
April involved a conspiracy to commit illegal trades with Mr.
Boesky that included transactions other than those to which
Mr. Milken pleaded guilty. But Mr. Milken never said what the
other trades were, and Judge Wood said on Monday that to
issue an appropriate sentence she needed to know more about
them.
   In response, Arthur Liman, the lead attorney for Mr.
Milken, wrote a letter to the judge listing additional
transactions.
   When he entered his plea last April, Mr. Milken said he
forced an unwilling Fischbach Corp. into the hands of
corporate raider Victor Posner by having Mr. Boesky take a
large and unlawfully secret position in the company's stock.
Mr. Milken also said he helped Mr. Boesky evade net-capital
rules and used Mr. Boesky to artificially support the price
of MCA Inc. common stock while Golden Nugget Inc., a Drexel
client, was selling its MCA shares.
   In the letter to Judge Wood, Mr. Liman said that Mr.
Milken had further assisted Mr. Boesky in evading net-capital
requirements by secretly agreeing to buy American
Broadcasting Cos. and Enserch Corp. securities from him in
early 1985, with the understanding that the securities would
be bought back later at no loss to Drexel.
   Mr. Liman also detailed securities trades in eight
different companies that were intended to enable Boesky to
recoup losses he had suffered on other illegal trades with
Mr. Milken. These compensatory trades, which occurred in
1985, involved securities of Leasco, First Texas, Valero
Energy Corp., MCI Communications Corp., Wickes Cos., Republic
Airlines, MSA Realty Corp. and MSA Shopping Corp.
   Mr. Liman also said that Mr. Milken had encouraged Mr.
Boesky to invest in securities of Diamond Shamrock Corp. and
Harris Graphics Corp., with the understanding that Drexel
would share in any of the profits Mr. Boesky derived.
