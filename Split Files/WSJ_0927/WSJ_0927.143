   DENVER -- Federal regulators conceded that some of the
conflict-of-interest regulations Neil Bush allegedly violated
as a director of a Denver thrift are vague and don't
explicitly forbid the business relationships he had with
borrowers.
   The comments came in testimony during a hearing on
administrative charges brought against Mr. Bush, the
president's son, by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The OTS
has charged Mr. Bush with violating regulations by not fully
disclosing to fellow board members the extent of his business
ties with two real estate developers. Those developers were
involved in at least $130 million in loans and other
transactions at Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association
and caused losses of at least $60 million to the thrift.
Silverado collapsed in December 1988 and is expected to cost
taxpayers $1 billion to clean up.

   However, in a development that may prove damaging to Mr.
Bush's defense, the administrative law judge overseeing the
hearings said the written record showed that the involvement
of a company run by Mr. Bush with a company run by developer
Kenneth Good wasn't disclosed when Mr. Bush sought a $900,000
line of credit for Mr. Good. In 1986, Mr. Bush set up JNB
International Inc. to participate in a consortium with Good
International Inc. to seek oil and gas business in Argentina.
Mr. Bush sought the line of credit from Silverado so that
Good International could prove its financial strength to the
Argentinian government.
   But minutes of Silverado board meetings and a memo
prepared for Silverado management indicate the board was told
only that Mr. Bush's other oil company, JNB Exploration Inc.,
had an affiliation with Good International. The involvement
of JNB International "certainly was not disclosed on any of
these forms," the law judge, Daniel Davidson, said during the
proceedings. The OTS has specifically charged Mr. Bush with
making an "insufficient" disclosure because of the
involvement of JNB International.
   Mr. Bush has said that he told Silverado officials orally
of the connection with JNB International and that the mention
of JNB Exploration in the documents made it clear he and Mr.
Good were involved in the venture. But a former regulator
hired by Mr. Bush as an expert witness admitted it may have
been important for the board to know exactly which entity was
involved in the transaction. For instance, he said, the board
might be interested to know whether Mr. Bush had different
levels of personal liability in the companies.
   Though the OTS officials said the regulations governing
conflict of interest weren't explicit, the agency has
maintained it has broad power to challenge the conduct of
directors and officers for breaches of fiduciary duty or for
unsafe and unsound practices. It wasn't clear whether the
concessions by regulators yesterday would hurt the
government's case.
   Under questioning by James Nesland, an attorney for Mr.
Bush, federal officials who regulated Silverado insisted that
Mr. Bush breached his duty to the thrift, but admitted that
regulations don't specifically list the kinds of business
relationships that constitute a conflict of interest.
   In one of the three charges against Mr. Bush, the OTS said
he shouldn't have voted on $100 million in loans and other
transactions involving real estate developer Bill Walters
because Mr. Walters had an investment in JNB Exploration, and
had given Mr. Bush's company a $1.8 million line of credit
from a bank controlled by Mr. Walters. Mr. Bush didn't
disclose these ties on conflict-of-interest forms he filled
out at Silverado.
   But Terry Sandefur, a former regulator of Silverado now
with the OTS in Topeka, Kan., admitted that the regulations
don't explicitly say a director is forbidden from voting on
loans in such a situation. Mr. Nesland needled Mr. Sandefur
about his testimony that such business connections could lead
a director to act against the interests of the thrift, even
if only "subconsciously."
   "Does a director have to discern his subconscious?" Mr.
Nesland asked.
   "No, but a director has to use reasonable standards," Mr.
Sandefur replied.
   Yesterday was the second day of the hearings at the
federal court house here. Mr. Bush again didn't attend, but
is expected to testify today, along with another former
director.
