   CANBERRA, Australia -- August sales of new houses in
Australia rose 7.7% from July and 10% from a year earlier,
the Housing Industry Association, a trade group, said,
attributing the rebound to lower interest rates.
   The August sales were at the highest level in 17 months,
excluding a February miniboom caused by the introduction of
lower-interest, fixed-rate loans. Most of the increase in
August came from first-home buyers.

   The association said the "strong pickup" in sales since
June isn't reflected yet in official housing indicators.
Sales lead building approvals by two to three months, so
official approvals are likely to edge up in October and
November, and housing starts should rally in early 1991, the
group said.
