   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. unveiled a
printer and printer software, the latest weapons in its
battle to crack markets traditionally served by personal
computers.
   Sun's new software, a $495 program called NeWSprint,
breaks ground for Sun, because it allows the company's
workstations to use a much broader range of printers than
before, including inexpensive dot-matrix machines and
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s popular ink-jet printers. Until now,
Sun workstations could "talk" only to printers with
sophisticated processing abilities built in.

   The software is part of Sun's two-year strategy of
increasing its share of markets, such as corporate offices,
that mainly use personal computers tied into networks. Sun
has cut prices of some of its machines to less than $5,000,
bringing them to PC price ranges, and has persuaded software
houses, such as Lotus Development Corp., to adapt their PC
software to Sun's workstations.
   But without a printer-software package such as NeWSprint,
which includes fonts, or print typefaces, that are compatible
with Adobe Systems Inc.'s PostScript, Sun's machines couldn't
easily be integrated into many personal-computer networks.
"As far as driving revenue and profit, it's not meaningful,"
Cliff Friedman, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said. "But
as far as their two-year goal, it's critical."
   The new software is unique, because it places the
"intelligence" necessary for printing -- the processing of
typefaces and graphics, for example -- in the computer,
rather than in the printer. In a conventional scheme, the
laser printer contains the intelligence, which tends to slow
down the printing process.
   Sun's new Sparcprinter, priced at $2,695, prints twice as
fast as Sun's older, $6,400 LaserWriter. Analysts said that
the printer isn't a threat to more entrenched laser printer
makers, such as Hewlett-Packard, but that it will help Sun
dealers offer more attractively priced computer packages.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun shares
closed at $27.75, up 50 cents, on volume of more than 1.4
million shares.
