   WASHINGTON -- A government task force voiced concern about
discrimination sparked by the employer-sanctions component of
the 1986 federal immigration law, but did not call for the
repeal of the provisions.
   In a report, the task force headed by John R. Dunne,
assistant attorney general for civil rights, recommended that
Congress approve stiffer fines and stronger enforcement
against employers who violate the law's anti-discrimination
provisions. It also called for better education of employers
and employees on the law's requirements, and simpler forms
and procedures for verifying an employee's work eligibility.

   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act was intended
to curb illegal immigration by imposing penalties against
employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers, and
requires them to check the work-authorization documents of
all employees hired. The federal General Accounting Office
found earlier this year that the sanctions had prompted a
"widespread pattern of discrimination" by employers against
job applicants who appeared foreign-born.
   The task force said it was "deeply concerned" about the
sanctions' discriminatory effects, but did not address
whether the measures should be repealed because that issue
should be decided by Congress.
   Minority and civil rights groups that have been lobbying
for repeal of sanctions were encouraged by the findings. "The
ball is in Congress' court" to repeal sanctions, said Cecilia
Munoz, a senior policy analyst with the National Council for
La Raza in Washington, D.C. "And it eliminates any lingering
doubts that sanctions cause discrimination."
   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Judiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, said the
recommendations weren't enough. "I'm skeptical that
safeguards such as those proposed by the task force can be
drawn tightly enough to end discrimination," he said.
Instead, he said he would continue to seek repeal of the
sanctions "because they are discriminatory against Hispanic
Americans, Asian Americans and other ethnic minorities."
