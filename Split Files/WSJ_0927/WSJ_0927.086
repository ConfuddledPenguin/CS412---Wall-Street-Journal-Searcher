   In the perennial war against wealth that afflicts
capitalism, envy is always the engine. The prime goal is to
discredit the claim that the rich earn the right to reinvest
their earnings.
   Today in America, the acids of envy are lapping at the
foundations of the system, with confiscatory capital gains
taxes, new state surtaxes and an all-out government campaign
against so-called junk bonds. Driving the campaign to a
climax is the lust for a living sacrifice, to be achieved
through the defamation, discrediting and final imprisonment
of Michael Milken.

   Now as Milken approaches sentence for a series of subtle
regulatory infractions, major investment journalists and
government officials rush to paint him in lurid colors as a
mugger, mobster or racketeer. In the case against Milken as a
Ponzischemer whose junk bond market concealed massive rot at
the foundations, the prime exhibit is a study by High Yield
Associates of New York.
   Supposedly refuting Drexel Burnham claims of an annual
default rate of 1.5%, HYA computed the cumulative rate of
defaults and troubled exchanges for each class of Drexel
issues from 1977 to 1989. The picture seemed grim indeed. For
example, the 1977 class saw 43% defaulted or exchanged for
low value securities by 1988; the 1981 class saw a 54% rate
of defaults or troubled exchanges by 1989. Other years ran
from 10% by 1989 for the 1982 cohort to 23% by 1989 for the
1986 cohort.
   It is true that by combining large recent issuing years
with years of far smaller totals, the Drexel overall default
figure of 1.5% misrepresented the real risks of high-yield
securities. A more accurate, though very conservative,
indicator of Mr. Milken's performance is the average annual
rate of return for his junk securities through 1989.
Including post-Milken issues, that rate is 11.7%, well above
the 9.6% annual yield of long-term Treasury bonds.
   Not only did purchasers of junk bonds gain high average
yields but shareholders in issuing firms also thrived. A 1989
study by John Pound of Harvard and Lilli Gordon of the
Analysis Group showed that high yield issuers increased cash
flow, profits and dividends and on average doubled their
price-earnings ratios. Michael Jensen of Harvard estimates
that junk bonds and buy-outs benefited shareholders by a
total of some $400 billion.
   In other words, beyond all the defaults and troubled
exchanges, high yield securities fulfilled their promise of
above average yields. Indeed they offered real rates of
return far above government bonds during the inflationary
1970s or stocks since 1973. To say that high yield securities
are a scam because many default is like saying that
capitalism is a scam because an estimated half of all
business startups fail within five years.
   The Pound-Gordon-Jensen figures include the issues --
roughly 40% of the total -- done by firms other than Drexel.
Despite a hugely greater exposure and its catastrophe between
1986 and 1989, Drexel outpaced most other high yield issuers.
Drexel's average annual rate of return on junk between 1977
and 1989 was well above the average for the market. Its
overall rate of defaults and troubled exchanges for all junk
issued between 1977 to 1990 was 9.6%. The rates for its
prominent rivals were: Merrill Lynch, 19.3%; PaineWebber,
43.1%; and L.F. Rothschild, 44.7%.
   The real target of the more frenzied enemies of Mr.
Milken, however, is not the junk bond but the supposedly
decadent U.S. economy of the 1980s, ridden with debt, low
investment and low productivity. The business expansion of
the 1980s, however, exceeded the recoveries of the 1960s and
1970s in precisely the areas where junk bonds were
concentrated. Business fixed investment, for example, reached
an average of 12% of GNP, substantially higher than in the
1960s and 1970s recoveries, and capital equipment spending
averaged 8.4% of GNP, compared to 5.7% in the 1960s and 7.3%
in the 1970s. In remarkable contrast to critics' claims,
manufacturing rose slightly as a proportion of GNP and
manufacturing productivity growth at 3.9% exceeded the record
of 3.3% during the 1960s boom. U.S. industrial output rose
41.5% in the 1980s, and the U.S. increased its share of
global employment, exports and manufactures.
   All these gains jibe closely with the focus of junk bond
issues. As economist Glenn Yago documents in "Junk Bonds," to
be published this fall by Oxford University Press, junk bond
issuers accounted for some 82% of all the annual job growth
of all public companies between 1980 and 1986. Overall, junk
bond issuers created jobs four times faster than the economy
as a whole, achieved a one-third higher growth in
productivity, increased sales 50% faster and generated three
times faster growth in capital spending. Some 33.9% of all
issuers were manufacturing companies and between 1980 and
1986, they increased capital spending four times faster than
the manufacturing sector as a whole and accounted for nearly
40% of all the growth in capital spending among public
manufacturing firms.
   More important still was the critical role of junk bonds
in financing such crucial American businesses as fiber
optics, telecommunications and television. Drexel managed
multibillion dollar issues for Turner Broadcasting, MCI,
Tele-Communications Inc., McCaw Cellular, and many other
companies without firm collateral -- companies that could not
possibly have raised comparable sums anywhere else. These
firms, backed by Drexel, have been critical to U.S.
competitiveness in communications not only by their own
contributions but by providing markets for many U.S. high
tech suppliers.
   In addition, as documented in a study by John Paulus and
Stephen Waite of Morgan Stanley, high yield securities have
been critical to the computer industry. Between 1985 and
1989, some 80% of all computer industry finance came from
junk, including crucial issues during downturns for Compaq,
Silicon Graphics, Cray Research, Alliant, Convex and Evans &amp;
Sutherland, all among the elite in the business. The hard
disk drive industry, also an American forte, was saved from
ruin by junk, including $250 million for Seagate and large
issues for Connor, Maxtor and other major firms that won for
the U.S. more than 70% of the world market. Micro Technology
and VLSI Technology were among the recipients of the $500
million in high-yields that financed the microchip industry.
Junk alone, often supplied by Morgan Stanley when Drexel
foundered, enabled these firms to survive downturns without
selling out to foreigners.
   One of the most amazing canards of Mr. Milken's critics is
the notion that junk bonds somehow caused the savings &amp; loan
crisis. Only 5.3% of S&amp;Ls held any junk bonds at all and
their junk comprised less than 1% of all S&amp;L assets. But the
firms that did use these securities were among the most
successful of all thrifts until the draconian measures of
July 1989 forced them to mark down and sell most of their
holdings into a sinking market within 90 days.
   From the capital gains tax debate to the boycott of Korean
grocers in Harlem, from the assault on Chinese entrepreneurs
to the invasion of Kuwait, the war against wealth continues.
Fueled as usual by envy and ignorance, the current siege
against Mike Milken and junk bonds is a symbol of that
perpetual struggle at the heart of capitalism. But in
sacrificing him, the U.S. is succumbing to an obscurantist
disease that can ultimately cripple American competitiveness
and prosperity.
