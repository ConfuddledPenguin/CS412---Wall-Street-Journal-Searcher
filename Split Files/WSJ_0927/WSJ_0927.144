   Thursday, Sept. 27, 8:30-9:30 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "The
Flash" is a surprisingly captivating adaptation of the old
comic strip. People who normally find it impossible to sit
through "Superman," "Batman" and similarly bloodless
high-tech fantasies can nevertheless delight in The Flash
(John Wesley Shipp) and his gift of superhuman speed. There
is a nicely earthbound complexity about Flash, no
lantern-jawed blob hurtling untouchably through the skies. In
fact, Flash's extraordinary powers result in some interesting
physical difficulties. Just because a person is endowed with
the power to fly faster than the speed of light doesn't mean
you can't identify with his blood sugar problems. Thanks to
his powers Flash has an appetite disorder -- a compulsion to
gorge himself. They have been fiendishly clever, these
writers, to have thrown a compulsive eater theme into this
pot: to have associated heroism and triumph over evil with
food craving, and then larded it, so to speak, with scenes of
Flash devouring pizzas and doughnuts. Who knows why "The
Flash" works? We are dealing with magic powers here.

   Saturday, Sept. 29, 10-10:30 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Carol &amp;
Company" -- a comic sketch laced with fine adult darkness. No
comedienne around has Ms. Burnett's dramatic skills and the
series exploits those skills admirably -- so far. The first
episode (on the old and their children) mixed real spleen
with warmth. Ms. Burnett's comedy is knowing and fierce and
civilized, not the sort of thing you see on television every
day.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 30, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary so check local listings.): "The Heat of the Day,"
an adaptation of the Anglo-Irish writer Elizabeth Bowen's
novel of wartime London that isn't the least bit evocative of
wartime London. Like so much of Ms. Bowen's fiction, the life
lived here is life lived in the head, in which the landscape
and passion are all psychological.
   This works very well for the novel, not well for the
screen, and especially not the way it has been adapted. Just
what the world needed, Elizabeth Bowen translated by Harold
Pinter. Still, it is worth seeing for Patricia Hodge, who
manages, role after role, to extract the greatest power and
attractiveness from the suffering of misprized love. There is
the wonderfully menacing Michael Gambon as the fattish middle
aged counterspy. Also Michael York and Dame Peggy Ashcroft,
who, as ever, sits about looking aggrieved by the burden of
living.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 30, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "The Face of
Fear" -- based on a work by Dean R. Koontz, a best-selling
horror novelist for reasons that will not be easily apparent
to anyone watching this stew of artless violence. All this
has to do with a psychic struggling for his rightful place in
the sun -- particularly against police and other people still
rational enough to raise questions about the sanity of people
convinced that they have extraterrestrial powers. It also
concerns a string of murders, bringing us to the movie's one
redeeming feature -- the terrifyingly effective portrayal of
a couple of psychotic killers. The character played by
William Sadler is especially chilling, and always a welcome
relief from the maunderings of the psychic.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Oct. 1, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "The Keepers of
Eden" -- about zoos that, this film informs us, are the new
refuges for wildlife on the verge of extinction. We learn
that because tamarind monkeys are notoriously infertile, wise
heads were put together to boost their fecundity. Thus was
born the romance of Nikos and monkey 1772, who will enrich
the world with their offspring. This interesting film is yet
another installment in the saga of naturalist Gerald
Durrell's zoo on the Isle of Jersey.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Oct. 1, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "A Promise To Keep"
-- a strongly affecting story (based on fact) with an
unusually sensible script about a financially hard-pressed
couple who take in four orphaned children of relatives. This
outline alone should make reasonable people turn away. Still,
without treacle or sentimentality -- of the wrong kind -- the
authors put together a credible and moving work, in which
they were abetted by the excellent work of William Russ as
the beleaguered father, and Dana Delany, the winsome nurse
from "China Beach."
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Oct. 10, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E: "Our Century --
The Normandy Invasion." A reminder that this fine series,
which was pre-empted for a few weeks, has resumed. The
Normandy invasion film obviously makes use of captured
footage and offers behind-the-lines scenes few Americans have
ever seen. It includes a recorded speech by Gen. Erwin Rommel
as he assures his men, standing ready at the wrong Channel
beach, that all is in readiness for the Allied landings.
