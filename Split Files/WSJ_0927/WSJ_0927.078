   Left-wing gunslingers in El Salvador have found a new ally
to help wreck the country's already precarious economy. On
the agenda awaiting Procter &amp; Gamble shareholders in
Cincinnati on Oct. 9 is a proposal to stop the company from
buying Salvadoran coffee beans for its Folger's unit. James
Gamble, an heir to the P&amp;G fortune, blames Salvadoran
landowners for the continuing strife, and in alliance with a
few family members and another shareholder, has asked that
the company slam the producers with a boycott. The company
itself has let it be known that it does not wish to depart
from U.S. government policies. While Mr. Gamble can no doubt
afford to savor a pricier brew as he ponders his activist
agenda, we doubt he will be toasted by small Salvadoran
farmers and workers who would be hurt by the boycott.
