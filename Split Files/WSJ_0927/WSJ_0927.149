   NEW YORK -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board took
steps toward replacing a controversial rule on accounting for
income taxes.
   The proposal would allow companies to book a deferred or
future tax credit on current income statements by
anticipating future income. Because a company must have
earnings to realize a tax benefit in future years, it must
expect that it will be profitable enough to recognize the tax
benefit on its financial statement in the current year.
Therefore, the new rule would largely apply to profitable
companies; loss-producing companies would continue to use
tax-loss carry-forwards.

   Under the existing rule, such current recognition of a
future tax benefit can't be recognized, because income
anticipation isn't permitted. "Now they are saying you can
anticipate future incomeincome that is expected or more
likely than not to occur in future years, which would allow
you to recognize" a later tax benefit currently, said Ray
Simpson, manager of the tax project for the FASB.
   The board, based in Norwalk, Conn., directed its staff to
develop an "exposure draft," or a new proposal that could
eventually lead to a new rule. The staff could issue a new
proposal in two months. But it isn't clear how soon after
that a new rule might be issued, because a public-comment
period is required, after which the board will reconsider the
proposal.
   Although he said the existing rule doesn't officially take
effect until fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 1991, Mr.
Simpson said some companies are already following it.
