   For Loathing of Favored Stocks

   NEW YORK -- You know the stock market isn't in great shape
when money managers can't resist the urge to unload their
best stocks.
   For example, James LaTorre, vice president, investments,
at the Ivy Fund, is trimming his holdings of U.S. Surgical, a
fast-growing medical instrument concern. U.S. Surgical's
share price has nearly doubled in value this year. The stock
trades at about 40 times the company's annual per-share
earnings, compared with a ratio of about 14.5 and falling for
the overall market, and this makes Mr. LaTorre nervous.

   "Nothing goes straight up," he said. "The first negative
thing that comes across about the stock will send it
tanking."
   Fear is as familiar as greed on Wall Street, but it
doesn't often permeate so strongly the hallowed upper
echelons of favored growth stocks, especially blue chips. But
it is doing so now, as some of money managers' favorite
growth stocks of the year are being pummeled almost daily.
This is the result of money managers' getting out before
their worst fears materialize: safe-haven stocks being sucked
into the vortex of the market's downward spiral.
   "PepsiCo, and growth stocks like it, are the last to go,
but when they go, they'll go fast," Harvey Eisen, president
of SunAmerica Asset Management Corp., said. "This is really a
textbook 1973-1974 bear market."
   In that period nearly two decades ago, Mr. Eisen recalled,
a few growth stocks managed to hang above the sinking market
for a time. But eventually they fell mightily.
   "There are a thousand reasons why people are selling these
stocks" now, said Thomas Gallagher, managing director,
capital commitment, at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "But the main reason
is that we are in a bear market. And there's the feeling that
your first sale is your best sale."
   Growth stocks, Mr. LaTorre of Ivy Fund said, "are like
magnets," as they were earlier this year, when they were
leading the market higher and higher. Now, he said,
"Everybody is attracted to them in terms of selling," because
they are actively traded and easy to sell.
   When he was raising cash in August, Mr. LaTorre trimmed
his portfolio of Coca-Cola, Federal National Mortgage
Association and Aluminum Co. of America, among other issues,
even though he still likes these big stocks.
   "These were the `Nifty 50,' one-decision stocks, and now
the decision is, `Get me out,'" Jack Solomon, technical
analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said.
   Indeed, many of these stocks are falling faster than
second-tier issues. Aside from "recession resistant"
earnings, "unique products," "international franchises" and
"market niches" -- the buzz words bandied about in promoting
growth-stock investing this summer -- money managers are
finding that these issues are also full of volatility. These
are falling as speedily as they rose two months ago.
   For example, Lincoln Capital Management Co.'s U.S. Growth
Portfolio -- chock full of stocks such as Waste Management,
Merck and Reuters Holdings -- is down about 7% so far this
month, compared with a 4.2% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
   J. David Mills, senior vice president at Boston Co.
Advisers, said the current decline in big stocks shows that
money managers are dumping relatively expensive shares and
buying cheaper stocks. "Anything that hasn't gone down is
vulnerable," he said.
   As the market rallied to a record high in July, many
smaller stocks lagged behind. Money managers jumped into
highgrowth stocks and shares of big
disposable-consumer-products makers, to buttress their
portfolios against a recession, which can ravage corporate
earnings. For the year through Tuesday, a group of 5,000
stocks tracked by Wilshire Associates Inc., minus the stocks
in the S&amp;P 500, is down 17.87%, compared with a 10.44%
decline in the S&amp;P.
   But this month, the stock market pillars have come
tumbling down. Escalating oil prices have cast the projected
inflation-adjusted returns of growth issues into doubt. And
higher energy prices have cut into spending, calling into
question earnings estimates at consumer-products companies.
   Medical-supply and household-products companies are about
the only industry groups showing a gain this year, aside from
energy and gold.
   If a prolonged bear market takes hold, though, "There is
no place to hide," Ronald Sloan, executive vice president at
Siebel Capital Management Inc., said. "The hardest thing to
do is sit on your hands and let the thing play out."
   The selling isn't expected to abate in the next few days,
because many money managers want to show their clients a
hefty cash position at the end of the current quarter.
   "So far, we need a couple of more things to happen to
split the stock market like a ripe watermelon," Mr. Eisen of
SunAmerica Asset Management said. In his view, this could
simply be sharply higher oil prices and double-digit yields
on long-term bonds; the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond
yesterday finished with a yield of 9.12%.
   Through such clouds, however, Mr. Eisen already is
anticipating finding silver linings. The market's current
decline is "setting the stage for one of the great
money-making opportunities," he said, because stocks will
fall to "preposterous" levels.
   When will it be time to buy? "You have to have lucidity,"
he acknowledged, "and when you are lying in the gutter
bleeding, it is hard to look" at stocks and say they have
finally fallen enough. All he knows is that, for the moment,
the market "is awful."
