   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Sloppy management has pushed the
price tag of McDonnell Douglas's C-17 military cargo plane to
more than $400 million each, the chairman of a House
subcommittee on oversight and investigations charged
yesterday.
   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who leads the Energy and
Commerce Committee panel, said in a letter to Rep. Les Aspin
that cost overruns at the company's sprawling factory here
show there is a "need for action to protect the taxpayers'
interest," and he called on the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee to conduct a joint hearing into the
matter.

   While blasting the nation's No. 1 defense contractor for a
"management collapse," Rep. Dingell said the Air Force has
advised his staff that "the only mechanism left to get
{McDonnell} Douglas's attention was either to suspend or
significantly reduce progress payments on the C-17 program."
   A spokesman at McDonnell Douglas's St. Louis headquarters
acknowledged that the Air Force has halted all progress
payments on the C-17 since July, pending the completion of a
cost-performance review. But he disputed the $400
million-a-copy number, saying that it represented only the
first planes off the line; the real "flyaway" cost of a
single C-17, he contended, is about $120 million, based on
the 120 aircraft the Pentagon says it wants to buy.
   In his correspondence, Rep. Dingell cited internal
McDonnell Douglas reports from April, which showed that the
company's estimate to complete full-scale engineering and
development work on the C-17 had climbed more than $836
million above its earlier projection. He added that "more
disturbing, the situation appeared to have been
deteriorating" as time went on.
   The lawmaker, chiding the company for "an absolutely
appalling picture in factory labor performance," also singled
out a report that showed McDonnell Douglas "was spending 25.8
assembly hours to produce work its own industrial engineers
determined should take one hour." In May 1989, he noted, the
ratio of actual hours on the project to so-called "should
take" hours was 5.15; a year later, the figure doubled. "Some
learning curve]" said Mr. Dingell.
   But a spokesman for the company here downplayed the
Dingell letter, noting that an $836 million cost overrun
would still leave McDonnell Douglas some $300 million below
the contract ceiling of $4.9 billion. After that crucial
benchmark is reached, financially strapped McDonnell Douglas
would have to absorb all expenses on its own, without any
government reimbursement.
   Most importantly, the spokesman indicated that the company
is still below the ceiling level, and expects to remain there
until it completes the pact. The company, he reiterated, has
met every milestone on the C-17 program since November 1989.
