   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon, anticipating the signing of a
conventional arms-control treaty for Europe, said it will
withdraw 40,000 of the roughly 325,000 U.S. troops there
during the next fiscal year.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, "We have to begin the
drawdown now to respond in an orderly way to changing
security requirements and declining defense budgets."

   The roughly 12% cut, which involves 30,000 Army troops and
10,000 Air Force members, is likely to be only the first
required under the treaty that the U.S. hopes will be signed
as early as November. At one point, the U.S. pledged to
withdraw 100,000 troops under the pact and, now that the
Soviet Union is pulling all of its troops from Europe by
1994, the eventual U.S. cut is likely to be even larger than
100,000.
   The treaty won't directly require troop withdrawals.
Instead, it will require massive cuts in tanks and other
weapons, in effect, forcing the disbanding of units and the
withdrawal of their members.
   Under the troop-withdrawal plan announced yesterday, the
40,000 troops will be returned to the U.S., and their
European-based units will be disbanded. The Pentagon didn't
offer any details of the units involved but said that the
plan conforms to a list of European base closings announced
by Mr. Cheney last week, and that the plan is likely to
affect Germany the most.
   The Pentagon said that the withdrawals won't start before
January and that they will be phased in through the remainder
of the year that ends Sept. 30, 1991. That means no large
number of troops will be available for deployment to the
Persian Gulf during the current buildup.
   A Pentagon spokesman said the move is "unrelated" to the
Gulf operation, though the Pentagon isn't ruling out the
possibility that some of the troops might eventually be
assigned there.
   Completion of the treaty, on which the withdrawal is
based, is currently snagged over negotiating differences
between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Secretary of State James
Baker met yesterday in New York with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in an effort to overcome the differences.
   "In the event that the treaty is delayed," a Pentagon
spokesman said, "we'll examine the implications for this"
withdrawal.
