   NEW YORK -- The stock market lost more ground yesterday as
oil prices resumed their rise.
   Some softening of crude oil prices late in the afternoon
took the pressure off stock prices, which advanced from their
lows. Crude oil for November delivery settled to close with a
$1.14 rise at $38.67 a barrel.

   MCA ignited once again in the final half hour of trading
on rumors that Japan's Matsushita Electric is near finalizing
an agreement to acquire the entertainment conglomerate. MCA,
which had idled with a fractional gain for most of the day,
ended 7 1/4 higher at 61 1/4. The stock rocketed 19 1/2
Tuesday on word of the talks between the two concerns.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell to about a
40-point loss twice during the session, ended 25.99 points
lower at 2459.65.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 3.20 to 305.06, and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 1.68 to
167.52. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 2.96 to
282.33.
   Some 1,119 New York Stock Exchange stocks declined and 421
advanced.
   Big Board volume eased to a meager 155,570,000 shares,
down from Tuesday's 155,940,000.
   With the present stalemate between Iraq and most of the
industrialized world providing little news for the market to
trade on, traders have turned their attention to the federal
budget negotiations in Washington.
   Many market watchers say any movement in the deadlocked
talks could spark a short-term rally in stock prices.
   "Technically, stocks are very oversold here," said A.C.
Moore, director of research at Argus Research. "They will
respond favorably to any progress on the budget."
   Any bounce from these levels could catch some
unsophisticated investors by surprise. Thomas Gallagher,
managing director in charge of capital commitment at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said a lot of people who have no
experience shorting stock are selling borrowed shares with
abandon.
   So-called short sellers sell borrowed stock in hopes of
repaying their loans with cheaper shares when the market
falls.
   Mr. Moore isn't alone in looking for some relief from the
slump in stock prices. However, few are looking for a
sustainable advance.
   But Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said that while stocks are "vulnerable to
a rally," any advance would still be couched in the context
of a bigger bear market. "I see no clear signs of a bottom,"
Mr. Miller asserted.
   Mr. Miller cautions that the continued decline in Japanese
stock prices, which has been largely ignored of late by
American investors, could hurt world markets by "giving extra
impetus to a world monetary squeeze."
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph topped the most-active list
with volume of more than 7.4 million shares. Traders said the
activity was related to the company's 33-cent quarterly
dividend. The stock will trade ex-dividend today. AT&amp;T eased
3/8 to 31 1/2.
   Entertainment stocks that followed MCA higher Tuesday
rallied again late yesterday along with MCA. Walt Disney rose
3/8 to 90 1/2, Paramount Communications gained 5/8 to 35 1/2
and Time Warner added 1 1/8 to 72.
   Citicorp slid 1 to 14 1/2. The company's Citibank unit
will soon lay off 100 workers in its leveraged-lending unit
and transfer hundreds of others, a senior official at the
bank said. Other Citibank business units in the U.S. are
expected to announce cutbacks internally over the next six to
eight weeks.
   UnionFed Financial fell 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 after announcing
that it will restate its June year profit to a "significant"
loss.
   Harris Corp. fell 4 1/4 to 21. The company said it expects
profit in the six months ending Dec. 30 to be "substantially
lower" than the $56.4 million, or $1.14 a share, posted in
the year-earlier period. The company cited the "rapid
deterioration in domestic semiconductor markets" as cause for
the bleak outlook.
   Raymond James Financial fell 5/8 to 15 5/8. The company
bought back 275,000 shares of its stock from a single
institutional buyer.
   Deere tumbled 3 3/8 to 45 3/8, a new 52-week low.
Yesterday, Wertheim Schroder lowered its fiscal 1991 earnings
estimates for the second time in two weeks. The securities
firm predicts that sales in three of the company's four
businesses will decline next year. Wertheim said revenue from
Deere's fourth and largest business probably will be flat
with the current fiscal year.
   AmBase rallied 1/4 to 1 3/4. The insurance holding company
said there weren't any corporate developments to account for
the activity in its stock.
   Dana lost 2 5/8 to 24. Late Tuesday the company said
profit for the first nine months of 1990 would be reduced by
about 12% due to certain adjustments at its Diamond Savings &amp;
Loan unit. Dana said the unit will increase its loan loss
reserves by $10 million, and will spin off certain loans and
real estate development projects to other Dana units.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slid 3.11
to 310.06. Volume totaled 14,080,000 shares.
   Put warrants tied to the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei
225-Stock Average were among the most active Amex issues
again, climbing in anticipation of further losses in Japanese
stocks. Salomon Nikkei Stock Average Put Warrants added 1 7/8
to 20, while PaineWebber Group Nikkei Stock Average 4/8/93
Put Warrants rose 1 to 10 1/8. Various issues of Nikkei put
warrants have more than quadrupled in value since they were
first issued earlier this year.
