   WASHINGTON -- President Bush authorized the sale of five
million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
to damp surging oil prices, administration officials said.
   Mr. Bush labeled the draw-down, the first use of the
reserve in a time of crisis, as a "test." A recently enacted
law gave the president the right to conduct a
five-million-barrel test without declaring that a disruption
in supply is imminent.

   "We want to make it clear to those speculators that we
have oil available to put on the market," said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Officials said the administration also intends to consult
with Japan and Germany, starting at a meeting of the
International Energy Agency in Paris tomorrow, about a
possible long-term, coordinated use of strategic reserves.
Last week, the Energy Department, at a meeting of the
administration's top national-security aides, gave the
president a plan to sell 500,000 barrels of oil daily from
the reserve, which would be put on the world market in
combination with a total of another 500,000 barrels daily
drawn from the German and Japanese reserves.
   It isn't clear whether Japan and Germany will agree to
such a plan. They have been more reluctant than U.S.
officials to dip into strategic reserves.
   Until the past few days, Mr. Bush opposed tapping the
reserve during the crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
arguing that there isn't a genuine shortage of oil. But
officials said his view changed as prices shot skyward in
recent days.
   Mr. Bush's view evolved "as prices keep going up without
any physical change in the physical characteristics of the
market," said a senior administration official. "It seems to
be caught up in a certain speculative fever."
   Any steps to keep oil prices down would ease the
administration's worries about U.S. economic conditions and
also might serve to bolster public support for a prolonged
confrontation with Iraq by minimizing disruptions in daily
life.
   The five million barrels to be drawn from the reserve and
sold on the open market probably won't have an enormous
impact on oil markets. That amount represents only slightly
more than the approximately four million barrels of oil
Kuwait and Iraq exported each day before the crisis. But
administration aides hope the draw-down will send a signal to
oil traders that the U.S. won't let prices rise out of
control.
   If the U.S., Japan and Germany jointly decide to put a
million extra barrels of oil on the market daily, that amount
would ease the tighter supply situation created by the Iraq
crisis.
   By authorizing extraction of oil now, Mr. Bush is
approving the first use of the reserve in an international
crisis. Some oil was extracted and sold in a 1985 test.
   Many members of Congress have urged using the reserve and
have complained about price "gouging" by oil companies during
the tensions with Iraq. Thus, it seems unlikely Congress will
object to use of the reserve.
   The 590-million-barrel reserve was established after the
1973 Arab oil embargo to give the U.S. a cushion to use in a
time of an international crisis that produces a shortage. The
administration has been locked in a debate over whether to
use it in the current situation. Oil supplies at the moment
seem adequate, but prices are rising because of speculation
on oil markets about a potential future shortage if war
erupts in the Middle East.
   Oil prices have doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. Crude oil closed yesterday at $38.67 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The Energy, Transportation, State and Defense departments
have favored using the reserve to cool market speculation.
But the Treasury and Commerce departments have been opposed
-- as was Mr. Bush.
   "I think that when you have a real shortage of a product
or you see an external event that is going to guarantee that
there {will} be a shortage, then would be the time when you
most certainly should use the {reserve}," Mr. Bush told
reporters at the White House 10 days ago. "It is my judgment
that there isn't such a shortage at this time."
   Indeed, it still isn't clear that there is a shortage.
Just yesterday, Kuwait's minister of oil and finance, Sheik
Ali Khalifa alSabah, asserted that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other nations already have
made up for the shortfall caused by the ban on purchases of
oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   "It has all been replaced, 3.5 million barrels a day,"
said the minister, whose government was ousted by the Iraqi
invasion. He added: "What's driving up the market isn't
physical shortage, it's psychology."
   Others question whether the shortage has been eliminated,
and administration officials have come increasingly to
believe that the recent surge in prices has been caused
mostly by market speculators rather than the current supply
situation.
   On other matters, Sheik Ali Khalifa said Iraq has done
"extensive damage" to Kuwait's infrastructure and has killed
many Kuwaitis, although he declined to give numbers. The
Iraqis took about $300 million to $350 million in gold from
Kuwait's central bank, he said.
   The minister also said that the roughly $5 billion his
government-in-exile will give to the campaign against Iraq
will be divided about equally between military and
nonmilitary aid. He also said Kuwait and Saudi Arabia won't
aid Jordan until it changes its policy of maintaining ties to
Iraq. "Turkey and Egypt definitely, but Jordan will have to
change its policy as far as I am concerned," he said.
