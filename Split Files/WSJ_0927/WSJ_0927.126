   U.S. Trust Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter
loss of about $7 million, or 77 cents a share, because of $25
million in pretax charges against earnings in the quarter.
   However, the New York banking company, which specializes
in asset management and private banking, said it expects
fourth-quarter net income to exceed the $4.4 million, or 44
cents a share, earned in the year-earlier quarter.

   H. Marshall Schwarz, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the special charges will improve operating results and
significantly strengthen asset quality and loan-loss
reserves. "Our capital position remains exceptionally strong
and our dividend-paying ability is unimpaired."
   The charges include $17.4 million associated with its
wholly owned software subsidiary, Financial Technologies
International, and $7.6 million associated with commercial
real estate loans remaining in its corporate loan portfolio.
U.S. Trust has been liquidating the portfolio since 1987.
   Separately, U.S. Trust said it agreed with International
Business Machines Corp. to form a joint venture to design and
market trust and global custody systems for financial
institutions. U.S. Trust will contribute its Financial
Technologies International business and personnel, while IBM
will provide initial funding for anticipated developmental
projects. Financial details weren't disclosed.
