   "All journalism is an act of betrayal," according to Janet
Malcolm, the New Yorker reporter whose betrayal of one
interview subject may well provide the most fascinating First
Amendment case in the Supreme Court's next term.
   Actually, Janet Malcolm never quite said that, but the
quotation is pretty close to things she has said. If you
think there's a big difference between quoting what Ms.
Malcolm said and what she almost said, you've probably
already chosen sides in a controversy that has divided
journalists and judges alike as it makes its way through the
courts.

   On Monday the justices are expected to decide whether to
hear the case, which arises from Janet Malcolm's New Yorker
profile of the former projects director of the Sigmund Freud
Archives, a voluble psychoanalyst named Jeffrey Masson.
Despite long and apparently sympathetic interviews, Ms.
Malcolm's article was highly unflattering -- full of Mr.
Masson making colorfully indiscreet remarks. Mr. Masson sued.
He claimed that the most colorful and indiscreet of his
remarks were really supplied by Ms. Malcolm herself -- that
she had, for example, created from whole cloth a passage in
which he bragged, "I was like an intellectual gigolo" to the
aging Anna Freud.
   Hoping to end the case without a trial, Ms. Malcolm asked
the courts to assume for the sake of argument that she did
make up the quotations. The First Amendment, she argued,
protected her even if she changed Mr. Masson's words, because
Jeffrey Masson was the kind of self-dramatizing loudmouth who
probably would have said these things if he'd had a chance.
For example, to defend her "intellectual gigolo" quotation,
Janet Malcolm pointed to a passage on the tapes in which Mr.
Masson described himself as "a private asset but a public
liability" for Anna Freud.
   Most of us would rather be called either a private asset
or a public liability than a gigolo. But the Court of
Appeals, obviously concerned about the First Amendment
consequences of letting the case go to a jury, said that Ms.
Malcolm's quotation was close enough. As long as her version
was a "rational interpretation" of what Mr. Masson actually
said, she was free to put her own words into his mouth.
   The Court of Appeals got it wrong (at least the majority
did -- Judge Alex Kozinski wrote a devastating dissent).
Wrong not because the court relied on the First Amendment --
the amendment is at the heart of the matter -- but because it
acted as though the press were the only party with a First
Amendment interest at stake.
   When the Bill of Rights was drafted, practically every man
with the inclination could become a pamphleteer. Freedom of
the press was just an offshoot of freedom of speech. Both
were freedoms that allowed every individual to be heard.
   Today's institutionalized press is a far cry from the lone
pamphleteer. Fewer and fewer people have any prospect of
owning or writing for the mass media. Yet in the past 30
years, as control of the press was becoming more
concentrated, the protection the press received in the courts
was growing stronger.
   Why? Because, despite its increasingly concentrated
ownership, today's press still is devoted in the main to
communicating the views of many individuals. We don't read
the papers to find out what the publisher has to say about
the Middle East, but to find out what George Bush has to say,
what Saddam Hussein has to say, what the wives of the 82nd
Airborne and thousands of others have to say.
   We value the press precisely because it brings us the
speech of these thousands of individuals. So when the press
goes to court seeking special constitutional protection we
know that it is also defending the free-speech interests of
thousands who might never be heard without a free press. It
is the value of their speech that often tips the balance in
favor of protecting the press.
   But the press does not have those rights on its side every
time it goes to court. The Court of Appeals erred because it
didn't see that when a reporter or a publisher puts his own
words into someone else's mouth, he ceases to be the ally of
all those thousands of individual speakers. He becomes their
enemy -- and his readers' as well. When we read a reporter's
summary of someone else's remarks, no matter how
dispassionate, we know we are getting the news through a
filter, and we make allowances. That's why quotations are so
powerful. They tell us that we're getting the speaker's words
direct, without an intermediary.
   Or at least that's what we thought before the Masson case.
Now we can't be sure.
   Under the lower court's rule, we may be getting only the
reporter's "rational interpretation" of the speaker's words,
an interpretation later dressed up in quotation marks to add
drama and disguise the reporter's hand.
   Perhaps Janet Malcolm and reporters like her should be
free to alter quotations and argue later that the words they
used were "close enough" -- that they captured the spirit if
not the letter of the speaker's remarks. Sometimes that will
be true. And sometimes their changes will reflect something
less admirable -- perhaps even a deliberate attempt to
mislead.
   Deciding whether the altered quotations are poetic license
or deceit depends on a weighing of all the facts -- precisely
the kind of job that juries do every day in our judicial
system.
   There is no reason to take such questions away from the
jury on First Amendment grounds. With First Amendment
interests on both sides of the scale, the courts should treat
a reporter who has altered quotations no better and no worse
than any other tradesman accused of peddling fraudulent
goods.
