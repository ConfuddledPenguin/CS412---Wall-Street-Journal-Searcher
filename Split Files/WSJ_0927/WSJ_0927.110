   La Quinta Motor Inns Inc. said its board adopted a
shareholder rights plan that will allow shareholders to
acquire La Quinta common stock at a discounted price if a
person or group acquires 15% or more of the company's stock.
   The San Antonio, Texas, company said the rights plan
wasn't prompted by any pending takeover or change of control.
But Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd. of Hong Kong has been
steadily increasing its stake in La Quinta, and early last
month announced that it held 14.4% of the company's common
stock, or 1,883,600 shares.

   La Quinta officials said Industrial Equity, which is
controlled by Brierly Investments Ltd. of New Zealand, hadn't
informed the company of any takeover intentions.
