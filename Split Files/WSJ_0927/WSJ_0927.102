   WASHINGTON -- In further signs that the economy
deteriorated in August, the government reported that orders
for heavy manufactured goods fell while growth in Americans'
personal incomes and spending failed to keep pace with
inflation.
   Orders to factories for durable goods -- so-called
big-ticket items such as cars and computers -- dropped 0.8%
in August despite a 12.4% jump in orders for defense
equipment, the Commerce Department said. Personal income
edged up only 0.3%, while personal spending grew 0.5%,
according to the department. After taking inflation into
account, spending was down 0.1%, and disposable personal
income was off 0.3%.

   The numbers are the latest in a string of bleak economic
statistics for August -- the month Iraq invaded Kuwait,
sending world oil prices soaring. Retail sales, industrial
production and housing construction all fell during the
month. The unemployment rate rose, and private industry
employment stayed flat.
   A growing number of economists believe the economy is on
the verge of a recession, if not already in one. For many,
yesterday's reports reinforced that view.
   "The decline in durable-goods orders provides further
confirmation that the recession began in August," said Gordon
Richardson, an economist at the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Not only did factories suffer a decline in new orders, but
their backlog of unfilled orders decreased for the second
time in three months. "That cushion is beginning to shrink,
and that's a bit of a worrisome thing," said Samuel Kahan,
chief financial economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago.
   The government reported Tuesday that the economy slowed to
a near-standstill in the second quarter. That was before oil
prices soared, and many analysts fear the burden of higher
energy costs on businesses and consumers will push the
economy into a downturn after almost eight years of
expansion.
   But some economists were encouraged by the personal
spending figures, even though the 0.5% gain in August failed
to keep up with inflation and was smaller than July's 0.6%
rise and June's 1.2% increase.
   "The dire concerns people had was as soon as oil prices
started skyrocketing, consumers would pull back spending
immensely," Mr. Kahan said, citing surveys showing a plunge
in consumer confidence in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion.
"But actual spending seems to be holding up. It's not strong,
but it's holding up better than some of the doomsday-sayers
feared. I think the numbers are more consistent with an
economy that is virtually at zero."
   Because spending outstripped income growth, Americans'
saving rate dropped to 4.3% of disposable income -- the
lowest level in nearly a year. In July, the saving rate was
4.5%, and in June it was 4.6%.
   Overall, durable-goods orders totaled $127 billion in
August, compared with $128.05 billion the month before.
August's fall followed a 2.7% rise in orders in July, which
came after a 3.1% decline in June.
   Durable-goods orders generally have followed a jagged path
this year, rising one month only to fall the next. The
zigzags have left orders only 1.1% above where they stood a
year ago, according to the Commerce Department.
   In August, orders for transportation equipment rose 1.3%,
after jumping 4.5% in July and tumbling 6.3% in June, with
orders for cars, ships and tanks growing, and orders for
aircraft falling.
   Orders for primary metals dropped 1.7%, after rising 2.8%
in July. Orders for nonelectrical machinery -- a category
that includes computers -- plunged 6.1%, after growing 3.5%
in July. Orders for electrical machinery grew 2.6% on top of
a 1.5% gain in July.
   Capital goods orders outside of military equipment -- a
good barometer of business investment plans -- tumbled 11.2%,
after jumping 10.1% in July.
   Figures for the reports were adjusted for regular seasonal
fluctuations.
                                                                                                       

   Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on
personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted
annual rates in trillions of dollars.
