   A long-awaited congressional study failed to resolve
whether written integrity tests can reliably predict
dishonest behavior. The move effectively offered a reprieve
to thousands of employers who want to keep using the
controversial tests.
   The study, by Congress's Office of Technology Assessment,
questioned the credibility of research supporting the tests
but didn't dismiss it. The result: a declaration that
available evidence isn't conclusive.

   Because it isn't overtly negative, the finding deprives
foes of the exams of ammunition and appears to lessen the
potential for an outright ban. Integrity test makers have
lobbied for months against an unfavorable finding, fearing
federal limits comparable to those passed two years ago
against most lie-detector tests.
   While hedging on the validity issue, the report urged
"further government attention" to concerns arising from
intrusive test questions, a lack of safeguards against the
misuse of test results and the fact that many honest people
are rejected from jobs because they fail the exams. The
report also urged further study to insure that the tests
don't discriminate against minorities and women.
   "Assuming even a modest error rate, widespread use of
integrity tests could deny opportunity to many individuals,"
the study said. It cited data showing that the number of
people "incorrectly identified" as dishonest on some tests
range as high as 97%.
   Such findings drew praise from the National Employment
Lawyers Association, a workers' rights group, which said
integrity tests should be banned because they can "smear
honest job applicants."
   But a group of the largest publishers of the tests, who
maintain that the exams are more effective than alternative
screening methods, assailed the study as "inaccurate and
without scientific merit." They termed supportive comments
from some experts in the report as "positive aspects," but
repeated previously reported assertions that the technology
office distorted data to bolster an anti-testing bias.
   Officials of the office have denied the charges but may
face close scrutiny when lawmakers hold hearings on the issue
early next year. Legislative proposals to protect the
privacy, legal rights and job chances of people who take the
tests are probable, congressional aides said. They wouldn't
rule out efforts to ban the tests but judged them less
likely, given the intensity of the publishers' efforts as
well as complex and conflicting evidence about whether the
tests work.
