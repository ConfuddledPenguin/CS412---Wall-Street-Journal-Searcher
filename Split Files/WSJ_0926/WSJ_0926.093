   LOS ANGELES -- Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General
Motors Corp., and Samsung Group in Seoul, South Korea, said
they have teamed up to pursue a contract to introduce
domestic satellite communications to South Korea.
   The company said the South Korean government has said it
wants to establish a domestic satellite system with data,
voice and video communications and direct-broadcast
television capabilities. South Korea is expected to request
proposals in the spring of next year and to award a contract
in early 1992.
