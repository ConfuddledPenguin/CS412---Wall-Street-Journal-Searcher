   TOKYO -- The Japanese economy, underpinned by strong
domestic demand, will continue to expand, a set of indicators
released by the Economic Planning Agency shows.
   The leading indicator of the economy stood at 80 in July,
the latest reporting month, comfortably above the so-called
boom-or-bust line of 50 and rising from 61.5 in both June and
May. July was the fifth consecutive month in which the
leading indicator stayed above 50.
