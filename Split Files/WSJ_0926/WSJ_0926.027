   DES MOINES, Iowa -- Allied Group Inc. said it approved the
buy-back of up to $1 million of the insurance holding
company's common stock.
   Based on the stock's current $12.50-a-share
over-the-counter price, the buy-back could involve up to
80,000 shares, or 2% of the company's stock outstanding. The
program, expected to be finished within a year, depends on
market conditions.
