   While New Yorkers have been horrified in recent weeks by
stray-bullet shootings, the subway slaying of a Utah tourist
and other outbursts of violent crime, they have not been
alone. The increase in violent crime is not restricted to New
York.
   Across the country there have been shootings, knifings,
muggings and other acts of violence that have given rise to a
heightened national concern. Our ability to guarantee the
first civil right of every American -- the right to be free
from fear -- is now being severely tested.

   There is a growing sense among the American people that
our criminal justice system is too laden with legal traps and
technicalities to deal effectively with the problem. I have
seen the system up close for more than 20 years. Violent
felons use legal technicalities to avoid the bar of justice,
and convicted murderers utilize outdated procedures to clog
our appeals courts and dodge society's verdict.
Unfortunately, repeated efforts to address fundamental
defects in our criminal justice system -- to put the rights
of victims on a par with those properly accused of criminal
behavior -- have historically been tossed aside in exchange
for quick political fixes that grab headlines but achieve
little. We cannot allow it to happen again.
   In May 1989, President Bush proposed a tough,
comprehensive approach to reducing violent crime, including
legislative proposals to get at needless exclusion of
evidence where the police act in good faith; increased
finality of judgment through habeas corpus reform; effective
capital punishment procedures; and enhanced penalties for
offenses committed with guns.
   Last summer, the budget side of the president's ambitious
program was enacted, and this summer the Senate acted to
address some of the flaws in our current system. The House is
now poised to take a giant step -- in the wrong direction.
   Before Congress adjourns, two versions of the Crime
Control Bill are to be considered on the floor of the House.
The differences between them are stark indeed. On one side
are the president's proposals, which would restore to the
federal government an enforceable death penalty such as 37
states have had for years, allow the courts to consider all
evidence gathered by the police when they have made good
faith efforts to do their difficult jobs, and help curb the
maze of duplicative appeals that serve to postpone the
execution of convicted murderers for years.
   On the other side is the Judiciary Committee's bill, which
is an anti-crime bill in name only. For example, provisions
of the committee's bill would effectively abolish capital
punishment in the U.S. by requiring prosecutors asking for
the death penalty to address issues of racial statistics in
capital cases, instead of focusing on fairness in individual
cases.
   This provision probably not only would preclude the future
imposition of the death penalty, but would invalidate
virtually every capital sentence now in effect. It would not
matter how many aggravating factors were at work. If the
statistics didn't balance, and one racial group received a
disproportionate share of death sentences, the death penalty
would effectively be eliminated as a sanction.
   No prosecutor or judge worthy of the task ever takes race,
ethnicity, sex or religion into account in making a decision
in a particular case. Facts, and facts alone, should dictate
the course of a criminal investigation, its subsequent
prosecution, and the imposition of an appropriate sentence.
It would be both unconscionable and unconstitutional for it
to be otherwise. Yet the bill creates an incentive for
prosecutors to consider race to "fill the quota."
   Unlike the administration's version, the committee's bill
does not place meaningful limits on repetitive appeals,
mainly through habeas corpus petitions, which frustrate the
ends of justice and needlessly consume court time with claims
unrelated to guilt or innocence. Nor does it adequately
protect police officers who, despite their best efforts, are
later found to have run afoul of a legal technicality or
complex search-and-seizure requirement.
   In 1984, in U.S. v. Leon, the Supreme Court decided that
evidence obtained through "good faith" searches and seizures
pursuant to technically defective warrants would be
admissible as evidence of guilt. Most of us in law
enforcement hailed this decision, and we have ever since
tried to extend it, logically, to include warrantless
searches as well. We do not believe that evidence should be
suppressed and society should suffer when a policeman or
federal agent makes an honest mistake. And yet the
committee's bill would have just that effect. It does not
even pretend to extend the Leon exception and, while its
supporters would have us believe that the bill codifies Leon,
its actual words fall well short of what the Supreme Court
now permits.
   True reform, not a sham bill, is necessary to protect the
right of Americans to be free from fear in their homes, on
their streets and in their communities.
