   America West Airlines said it is continuing talks with Pan
Am Corp. over the possible acquisition of Pan Am's East Coast
shuttle but that an agreement hasn't been reached.
   The Phoenix, Ariz., carrier also said it is still
negotiating a possible lease of more than 100 Airbus
Industrie A320 jets in a transaction that would involve
financial support from manufacturers and leasing companies.
No agreement has been reached in those talks, America West
said.

   In a statement yesterday, America West's president,
Michael J. Conway, declined to say what price is under
discussion for the Pan Am shuttle but termed recent public
speculation "premature and not well founded." A spokesman for
New York-based Pan Am declined to comment.
   When Pan Am announced the shuttle was for sale, it said it
hoped to get about $250 million for it. Since then, however,
conditions in the airline industry have worsened
substantially.
   Pan Am put the shuttle up for sale in late May, not long
after cash-strapped developer and executive Donald Trump put
out feelers to determine how much money he might get from
selling the competing Trump Shuttle. Financially ailing Pan
Am has been selling assets and reorganizing to try to raise
cash.
   Last week, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett told Wall
Street analysts he expected to sell the shuttle by year end
but that he didn't expect any sale to actually be final until
1991. Mr. Plaskett also said the airline will cut 8.6% of its
work force, slash its 1991 capacity by 7.5% and switch to
smaller, more efficient jets from Boeing Co.'s fuel-guzzling
747s on several of its trans-Atlantic routes.
   America West -- with hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas and
with mostly Southwestern routes -- has for years sought a
toehold in the lucrative New York and Washington markets.
Owning a Northeast shuttle could provide that kind of access.
Last year, America West gamely tried to outbid Mr. Trump for
the Eastern Airlines shuttle after Eastern took refuge in
bankruptcy court. Negotiating right up to the deadline,
America West ultimately couldn't come up with the financing.
   It's unclear how America West might finance the
acquisition of the Pan Am shuttle, which like the Trump
operation connects New York to Boston and Washington. A
person familiar with the talks said the proposed aircraft
deal calls for America West to get $200 million in financial
aid from Guinness Peat Aviation -- the company that would
lease America West 26 of the A320s -- and from International
Aero Engines, a consortium of five engine manufacturers.
Airbus itself wouldn't provide any of the money, the person
said.
   The person said this financial aid could help underwrite
the purchase of the shuttle or help meet the costs of
introducing Airbus planes into the all-Boeing America West
fleet. The person said the two potential transactions aren't
dependent on each other.
   Half of the 100 A320s involved were ordered originally by
Pan Am. But in late 1988, Pan Am sold those delivery
positions to now-defunct Braniff Airlines. Braniff added
options on 50 more jets.
   Braniff folded last fall, leaving ownership of the planes
and delivery positions the subjects of bankruptcy court
litigation. A few A320 jets that were delivered have been
parked at the Las Vegas airport. Those and the remainder of
the Braniff order form the core of the transaction under
discussion between America West and Airbus.
