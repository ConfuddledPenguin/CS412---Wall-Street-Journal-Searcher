   STOUGHTON, Mass. -- Despite strong sales of its inflatable
athletic shoe, the Pump, Reebok International Inc. is still
struggling to get into shape.
   The company predicted yesterday that its third-quarter
per-share earnings will be about 10 cents below a year
earlier and that earnings for the year will be flat. Analysts
pegged the quarterly decline in domestic sales at about $40
million, mostly because of the company's older-line aerobic
shoes.

   Company officials said about half the shortage was from
terminating accounts with distributors -- called diverters --
who order an oversupply of athletic shoes and then resell
them to discount stores that Reebok refuses to deal with.
   "There's no question that there has been softness in the
classic lines, our aerobic and freestyle shoes," said company
spokeswoman Kate Burnham. "But we think that the Pump
technology is sound and will carry us forward."
   "I wouldn't want to be in Reebok's shoes," said Alice
Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. "They've found
themselves in a shrinking market in which competition is
intense."
   Mostly, Reebok is playing one-on-one against Nike Inc. in
the performance shoe market and against L.A. Gear Inc. in
sneakers. The only clear winner is Nike, which analysts
expect to slightly increase its market share to 30% by
year-end, with Reebok at 22% and L.A. Gear in the high teens.
   A recent survey by Sporting Goods Business, a New
York-based industry trade magazine, asked 278 retailers which
brands they thought would be hot through 1990. First was Nike
with 86%, then L.A. Gear with 35% and Reebok with 31%. "It's
no surprise: Nike has been consistent in its management,
product and advertising," said Robert Carr, the magazine's
editor. "Over at Reebok, in terms of advertising and
distribution, things have been pretty confusing."
   While Nike's advertisements have been winning awards,
Reebok has gone through several advertising firms and still
lacks a strong, coherent message. Gary M. Jacobson, an
analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., notes that the company,
which is having distribution problems with the Pump, has a
15% backlog of unfilled orders -- its largest product backlog
in several years.
   But how much can Reebok squeeze from the Pump, which
accounts for about 10% of its domestic shoe revenue? After
growing 30% in 1988 and 13% in 1989, the $4.5 billion U.S.
athletic footwear market is expected to grow barely 10% this
year.
   Yet many analysts see the fierce domestic competition
easing as both Nike and Reebok continue to expand into
overseas markets. Reebok's international footwear revenues
are expected to hit $430 million by year-end, almost double
last year's total.
   "We're used to seeing Nike and Reebok fighting it out with
million-dollar ad campaigns," says Mr. Jacobson of Kidder
Peabody. "But over in Europe, remember, they have no one with
the revenues and advertising punch of either of these
companies."
