   WASHINGTON -- President Bush urged world financial and
economic leaders to work to ensure the success of current
international trade talks, which he warned are behind
schedule and gravely threatened by the impasse over
agricultural subsidies.
   Shortly before Mr. Bush spoke, European Community farm
ministers in Brussels backed a new subsidy reform plan
proposed by EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry. But
the plan is unacceptable to the U.S. and to other big
agricultural exporters, such as Australia, Chile and Canada.

   "Agricultural reform remains a major stumbling block," Mr.
Bush said in his speech, asserting that the dispute over farm
subsidies "threatens to bring down the rest of the round" of
trade talks.
   Speaking on the opening day of the annual meetings of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Mr. Bush said the
current international trade talks are "the last train leaving
the station, and countries around the world must jump
aboard." He argued that a more open world trading system, the
goal of the talks, could be "the engine of economic growth
that carries us into the 21st century."
   The EC proposal would involve a cut of about 30% in
European farm subsidies from 1986 levels. The U.S. says that
such subsidies peaked that year, and the reform proposal
actually would amount to a cut of only 10% to 15% in the $120
billion the EC now spends each year on subsidizing its
agricultural sector.
   Italian Agriculture Minister Vito Saccomandi, who chaired
the regular monthly meeting of EC agriculture ministers, said
the proposed cuts were about as much as European farmers
would tolerate. But if the EC sticks to this position, it is
likely to undermine the talks.
   The international trade talks are aimed at reforming the
world's trade treaty, the General Agreements on Tarriffs and
Trade. The collapse of the negotiations "will inevitably
encourage increased protectionist pressure and political
stability," Mr. Bush warned in his gloomiest assessment to
date of the talks. "We must let farmers compete with farmers,
instead of farmers competing with the deep pockets of
government treasuries."
   The current international trade talks, which began four
years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, are scheduled to end in
Brussels in December. Negotiators are a long way from
reaching agreements on many contentious areas besides
agriculture.
   Dubbing the trade talks "one of the world's greatest
opportunities of the decade," Mr. Bush warned that much
remains to be done, and he stressed that there are less than
70 days left before the four-year talks are set to reach a
conclusion.
   The president also praised moves toward democracy and
market-oriented economies that have become apparent the past
year. But he said "a new challenge" has arisen that could
hinder this process: "Iraq's illegal and unprovoked
aggression against the sovereign state of Kuwait."
   This has imposed "a staggering burden" on economies in the
region and further afield, Mr. Bush said. But "initial
response" from the world community "has been impressive," he
added, alluding to the billions of dollars pledged by the
European Community, Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia, the
Kuwait government-in-exile and other nations.
   "To transform commitments into concrete contributions,"
Mr. Bush said, he was forming "a Gulf Crisis Financial
Coordination Group" to be chaired by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.
   The president also maintained that the World Bank and IMF
are key to helping the world through the Persian Gulf crisis,
and he said Mr. Brady today would make further
recommendations for how the two agencies could help countries
damaged by the crisis. "The political leadership of the U.N.
must be matched by the economic leadership of the IMF and the
World Bank," he said.
   Such rousing rhetoric aside, some of the wealthiest
nations are more eager to use their wealth elsewhere. West
Germany is trying to lower U.S. expectations about how large
a share it will take of the estimated $14 billion bill for
assisting the so-called Persian Gulf frontline states --
primarily Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- this year and next.
   Germany intends to contribute promptly, a senior West
German official said, but its contribution will be limited
because Bonn is already committed to paying $7.6 billion (12
billion marks) to move 600,000 East German-based Soviet
troops and dependents back to Russia. It would be unrealistic
for the U.S. to expect Bonn's Persian Gulf contribution to be
anywhere close to the pledged amount for relocating the
Soviet troops, this official said.
   A meeting of potential donors scheduled for today -- to be
chaired by Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford -- is
expected to try to set the shape and size of the aid package.
There are important differences between some of the donors --
the Saudis and Kuwaitis, in particular, apparently don't
favor giving aid to Jordan.
