   Seals May Not Clear Air on Green Claims

   A fledgling firm that grants a "green seal of approval"
for environmental advertising claims it finds worthy plans to
bless an array of recyclable products today. But consumer
confusion over such claims isn't likely to clear up any time
soon.
   At a news conference in Washington, D.C., Green Cross
Certification Co. will put its seal of approval on products
that include ones made by two nationally known companies:
Clorox, the consumer products maker, for the recycled content
of bleach boxes; and Ball Incon Glass Packaging, a big bottle
producer, for the recycled contents of its bottles and jars.
Later this fall, Green Cross is expected to certify
recyclable cans made by six leading U.S. steel manufacturers.

   Green Cross describes itself as a nonprofit division of
Scientific Certification Systems Inc., a closely held,
Oakland, Calif., food and product testing concern. Green
Cross charges manufacturers to verify environmental claims,
but only for the actual cost of the testing. It only tests
products submitted to it by the manufacturers. It issued its
first certification for a handful of smaller paper and
plastic companies last month. It claims the Green Seal
verifies that products meet a set standard, such as for
recycled content.
   Four West Coast grocery chains have begun promoting the
Green Cross program because they "don't want to be in the
position of having to judge (environmental) claims" or be
accused of misleading advertising, says Linda Brown, Green
Cross's vice president. The certification "will do a large
task in reducing the confusion."
   It's debatable, however, whether this environmental
labeling effort will enable many American consumers to assess
the proliferation of environmental advertisements that
promote products as friends of the earth.
   "People don't know what `environmentally friendly' means,"
says Lois Kaufman, president of Environmental Research
Associates, Princeton, N.J., pollsters on environmental
issues. "Just because one group tells them something (is
acceptable) won't necessarily clear up the confusion."
   Indeed, Ms. Kaufman adds, some manufacturers now are
hesitating "to jump on the environmental bandwagon for fear
it might backfire in their faces." These companies look
warily at the experience of Mobil Chemical Co., sued by seven
states last summer. The suits charged that Mobil exploited
popular misconceptions by making environmental claims for
Hefty trash bags that it knew were false. Mobil since has
settled with one state, Texas.
   Environmentalists say Mobil's alleged false advertising
has intensified public skepticism, persuading many people to
discount environmental claims entirely.
   Making matters worse, Green Cross isn't the only outfit
drafting national guidelines for environmental-safety
pitches.
   Green Seal Inc., a Washington group led by Earth Day
organizer Denis Hayes, intends to issue its own seals of
approval in early 1991 for items that reduce waste from
manufacture through disposal. The first five type of products
being tested are facial tissues, toilet paper, light bulbs,
house paint and laundry detergents.
   In the meantime, Green Seal is sparring with Green Cross
over its environmental purity. Green Seal takes issue with
its rival's certification today of the boxes in which Clorox
2 dry bleach is packed, for example. "What's the impact on
the environment of bleach?" asks Norman Dean, Green Seal's
executive director. "You have to examine the contents of a
package before you encourage people to buy it." Retorts a
Clorox spokesman: "Clorox 2 dry bleach does not contain any
ingredient shown to have a negative environmental impact."
   Manufacturers might reduce some consumer confusion over
environmental seals of approval by mounting major advertising
campaigns promoting the awards. Yet initial recipients of
Green Cross's seal are doing little to hawk it. Certified
products can carry a label containing the Green Cross seal
and an explanation, such as "made from at least 80% recycled
paper."
   Clorox, for instance, won't add the Green Cross to ads or
packaging for the bleach. The company simply will insert the
words: "Box made from recycled paper." Clorox isn't using the
symbol because "at this point, we're just seeing what we
have" before any decision is made on adding the Green Cross,
says Michael Reilly, Clorox manager of environmental
marketing.
   Similarly, Webster Industries won Green Cross's
endorsement last month for two brands of recycled plastic
trash bags, Good Sense and Renew. But the small Peabody,
Mass., company, dwarfed by competitors such as Mobil, plans
just one newspaper ad about the certification, due to appear
Oct. 17 in USA Today. "The next time you spend some green on
a trash bag, look for the Green Cross," the copy urges.
   Webster may run other advertising that features the Green
Cross label, says Claudia Berk, a senior vice president at
its ad agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates. "But at this point, I
am not sure what it will be."

   BBDO Lands Haagen-Dazs
                                                                                                       

   Haagen-Dazs, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, awarded the
$13 million account for its ice cream to BBDO, New York, a
unit of Omnicom Group.
   BBDO bested Chiat/Day/Mojo's New York office, the other
finalist. Yves E. Coleon, Haagen-Dazs's vice president of
marketing, said "it was a close call, but the creative
platform presented by BBDO seemed to offer the best long-term
potential for the brand."
   The ice cream maker put the account in review in July,
less than a year after it named Margeotes, Fertitta &amp; Weiss,
New York, to handle the account. Haagen-Dazs parted ways with
that shop because of a conflict with Godiva, another
Margeotes client that makes ice cream.
   When Margeotes won the business, billings were pegged at
$5 million. Mr. Coleon said yesterday that the jump in ad
spending reflects plans to advertise the brand much more
aggressively. He said its products have historically been
advertised mostly in print media, but the company is now
considering TV advertising. A new campaign is expected
shortly after the first of the year.

   AMERICAN HOME: American Home Products, New York, realigned
the ad assignments for a number of food products that
together bill about $10 million. The big winner is Laurence,
Charles, Free &amp; Lawson, New York, which picks up ad
responsibilities for Denison's Chili, Maypo, Chef Boyardee
frozen pizza mix, and other products. Isidore &amp; Paulson, New
York, was named to handle Gulden's Mustard. Those accounts
had been handled by Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor and
Ketchum Advertising. Young &amp; Rubicam, although it lost the
Crunch 'n Munch account to Laurence Charles, was named to
handle the ad assignment for two new products.
                                                                                                       

   DELLA FEMINA: Della Femina, McNamee's Los Angeles office
picked up two new accounts. Houston franchiser Jiffy Lube
International awarded the Eurocom unit the creative portion
of its estimated $8 million to $11 million account. Sir
Speedy, a KOA Holdings unit that franchises quick printing
stores, named the shop to handle its $3 million to $5 million
account.
                                                                                                       

   MERGER: TBWA Advertising, New York, said its London agency
would merge with Holmes Knight Ritchie, another British
agency. Terms weren't disclosed, but TBWA said the new
agency, which will be known as TBWA/Holmes Knight Ritchie,
will bill about $125 million. The two partners currently have
roughly equal billings. Dick Knight, currently chairman of
HKR, will be chairman of the new agency.

   WHO'S NEWS: Joseph M. Grimaldi was named chief operating
officer at Mullen, Wenham, Mass. He had been executive vice
president, director of client services. . . . Goldberg Moser
O'Neill, San Francisco, promoted Mike Massaro, formerly
senior vice president, to associate general manager.
