   The entire point of Sinead O'Connor's protest seems lost
to your Review &amp; Outlook staff. In "No One Sillier Than U,"
Asides, Aug. 28, the Irish singer is trounced for her
refusal, in her words, "to go onstage after the anthem of a
country that's arresting people and harassing people for
expressing themselves onstage." You suppose that Ms. O'Connor
was referring to performance artists and "chocolate-covered
women" bankrolled by the National Endowment for the Arts. In
truth, her unwillingness to perform after the American
national anthem was in protest of the arrest of members of an
allegedly "obscene" rap act after a performance in Florida.
You should be the first to understand and appreciate the
important distinction between taxpayer-subsidized art and
music that is a product of free-market supply and demand.
While we all are forced to pay the tab for NEA-financed art,
there is no such thing as compulsory rap-concert attendance.
   In this case, Ms. O'Connor was correctly standing up for
one of the guiding principles of the Founding Fathers:
namely, freedom of speech. Like the original American
patriots, her gesture was explicitly anti-Big Brother, not
anti-American. The uproar over this whole episode suggests
that far too many Americans are out of touch with their
roots, confusing true patriotism with an uncritical
acceptance of whatever the government does. As the prophetic
Ms. O'Connor observes on her latest album, "these are
dangerous days -- to say what you feel is to make your own
grave." Everyone who believes in personal and economic
freedom should be embarrassed that it takes a 23-year-old
Irish rock singer to remind us of our own heritage.

   Your derision of Ms. O'Connor's refusal to have the
national anthem played before her concert was baffling on
several counts. Least important, but worth noting, playing
the anthem before any rock concert is like playing Led
Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" to open a corporate board
meeting. It's not a matter of conflicting principles so much
as simple incongruity.
   Your assertion that there have been no "arrests . . . yet
of chocolate-covered women" is amusing, but ignores the
recent arrests of rappers 2 Live Crew and suits filed against
museums exhibiting photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's works.
Let's face it: The energy of vicarious moralizers is growing
today, much to the dismay of those of us who'd like to see a
bit of that energy directed toward issues like the deficit,
the environment or national competitiveness.
   Your editorial's (unintentional?) message is, "Ms.
O'Connor is a damn good publicist." Were she a brand of cola,
your "Marketplace" section would be describing her shrewd
leverage of the media to establish product differentiation.
Between the current incident and her refusal to appear on
"Saturday Night Live" with Andrew Dice Clay, Sinead O'Connor
has demonstrated that she is a first-rate marketer, a woman
of firm integrity or, by happy coincidence, both.

   It's too bad Ms. O'Connor doesn't understand the workings
of our government -- of the people by the people. It's not
the U.S. government objecting, but the people. After her
comments, I wonder how she is able to bank the dollars
printed by the U.S. government.
