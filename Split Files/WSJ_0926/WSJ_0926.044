   WASHINGTON -- The economy slowed to a near standstill in
the second quarter, growing at a frail annual rate of 0.4%,
revised government figures show.
   The performance, far weaker than the 1.2% pace the
government estimated in two earlier reports, is of particular
concern because the economy has since been socked by soaring
oil prices in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug.

   Yesterday's report, made by the Commerce Department after
reviewing new data, means that even before the jump in oil
prices piled new burdens on businesses and consumers, the
nation's real gross national product -- the
inflation-adjusted value of all the goods and services the
economy produced -- was barely rising. The earlier estimates
indicated a sluggish pace but clearly one of expansion.
   The White House expressed concern over the new figures but
continued to insist that the economy isn't in a recession.
   "It's not good news. The number is very low," spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said. "Obviously we are concerned about the
economy and the growth rate." Nevertheless, he added: "We
don't believe we are in a recession right now."
   Addressing a luncheon of the National Association of
Business Economists, Michael Boskin, chairman of the White
House Council of Economic Advisers, avoided mention of a
downturn.
   "Certainly we believe the economy now is on a weaker
growth path than we did in the summer, partly -- not
exclusively -- due to" the oil-price shock.
   But Mr. Boskin said the economy is better equipped to
weather the oil jolt than it was in the 1970s when soaring
oil prices pitched the U.S. economy into recessions in 1973
and 1979. Because of new efficiencies in U.S. industrial
production, "for each dollar of GNP we now use about
one-third less oil than we did in the 1970s," he said.
   An increasing number of private analysts, however, think
the feeble economy will be hurt enough by rising oil prices
to slip into a downturn after nearly eight years of
expansion.
   In a survey released yesterday, the business economists
association said more than half of 71 members polled believe
the economy is in a recession already or will be by the end
of the 1991 first quarter.
   And half of the top economists surveyed each month by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators now believe the economy will enter a
recession this year.
   Other private analysts maintain that the economy will
muddle through. "The economy is limping along at about the
second-quarter growth rate," said Robert Giordano, director
of economic research for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in New York.
"The oil-price hike can potentially reinforce this weakness
and the fourth-quarter GNP will likely contract or go down,
but the size of this oil-price shock and consequences to date
don't seem severe enough to create a full-blown recession or
downward spiral in the economy."
   A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters
of contraction in the GNP. For the past five quarters, the
economy has been growing at annual rates of less than 2%. It
barely inched ahead at a 0.3% annual rate in the fourth
quarter of 1989 before picking up to a 1.7% rate of expansion
in the first quarter of this year.
   The Federal Reserve to a large extent engineered the
slowdown in the economy by maintaining high interest rates in
an effort to battle inflation. But the central bank's growth
target was never as low as the recent pace. And now Fed
policy makers are under pressure from the Bush administration
to jump-start the economy by lowering interest rates to make
credit cheaper.
   But although the rising oil prices threaten the economy
with recession they also bring the prospect of resurgent
inflation, and consequently central bank officials are wary
of easing their grip on credit.
   In the second quarter the price of crude oil was running
under $20 a barrel. Yesterday it was trading at $37.53.
   The revisions to the second-quarter GNP reflected a larger
trade deficit and smaller inventories than the government
previously estimated. Personal consumption, which accounts
for about two-thirds of the country's economic activity, was
slightly smaller than earlier estimates.
   After-tax corporate profits declined 0.6% during the
quarter instead of 0.2% as previously estimated, the
department said, to an annual rate of $166.1 billion.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

quarter.
