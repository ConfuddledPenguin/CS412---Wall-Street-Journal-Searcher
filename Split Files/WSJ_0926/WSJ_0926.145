   BOSTON -- A move by Massachusetts to build investor
confidence in its approaching bond issue received an
unsympathetic response yesterday from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   S&amp;P rated the state's coming $1.04 billion bond issue
triple-B and placed the issue on the rating concern's
CreditWatch surveillance list, joining the triple-B rating on
the state's $5 billion of general obligation bonds.

   Last week, Massachusetts state officials said they will
set up an "irrevocable trust fund" for the new Series A bonds
that will receive sufficient personal income-tax receipts
each month. Another rating concern, Moody's Investors
Services Inc., swiftly responded by giving the new issue a
Baa-1 rating, slightly better than the worst-in-the-nation
rating of Baa on the state's general obligation bonds.
   In elaborating on its rating, S&amp;P said, "Continued
negative economic news and lower-than-projected July and
August receipts have resulted in two identified revenue
shortfalls totaling $464 million, some $310 million of which
was not identified until last Monday."
   An S&amp;P spokeswoman also said the rating was affected by
"risks of a potential budget imbalance" from the proposed
tax-rollback referendum by the Citizens for Limited Taxation.
The additional security provisions provided by the dedicated
trust fund, she said, "were not viewed as sufficient
enhancement to raise ratings, given the history of fiscal
stress and the current budget environment."
