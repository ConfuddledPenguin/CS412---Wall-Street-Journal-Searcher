   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Collagen Corp. said a one-quarter
delay in the planned spinoff of a unit will reduce by half
the profit it expects to report in the first half of its
fiscal 1991 year.
   That indicates profit for the biomedical concern will
likely fall in the range of $1 million, or 10 cents to 12
cents a share, for the first half ending Dec. 31, down from
about $2 million, or 23 cents a share, reported for last
year's first half.

   James T. McKinley, senior vice president and chief
financial officer, said it is impossible to forecast the
bottom line precisely at this point. But he added he expects
profit in the fiscal first and second quarters to be roughly
equal, and isn't projecting a loss in either period.
   Howard D. Palefsky, president and chief executive officer,
said that postponing the spinoff of Collagen's Celtrix unit
from October 1990 to early in 1991, will add an additional
quarter's operating expenses -- or about $1.5 to $2 million
-- to Collagen's costs.
   As reported earlier this week, the delay is the result of
a landlord's refusal to waive financial covenants contained
in a sale-leaseback agreement covering Collagen's Fremont,
Calif., manufacturing facility. Collagen says the agreement
expires at the end of the year, and it plans to renegotiate
terms to permit the spinoff.
   Despite the short-term strain on profit, Mr. Palefsky
stressed that the spinoff should help Collagen sharpen its
focus on its core businesses: injectible collagen for skin
implants, dental business and its target therapies
subsidiary. Mr. McKinley said he expects product sales from
those continuing businesses should grow 25% to 35% in the
fiscal first half, adding that these improvements "will
become more apparent as we focus on fewer things."
   Divesting itself of Celtrix was necessary, not only
because its focus on pharmaceutical research diverged from
Collagen's core business, but also because financing such
research "is beyond our current cash flow and equity base,"
he added.
   "We do expect a relatively short-term effect" on earnings
from the delayed spinoff, Mr. Mckinley said, "but we feel
it's the right move move for us, and the benefits will become
more apparent over time."
