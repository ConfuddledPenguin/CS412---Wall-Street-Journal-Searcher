   Telephone &amp; Data Systems Inc. offered to swap its
interests in certain rural cellular service areas for 12.5
million shares of U.S. Cellular Corp.'s common.
   If approved, the exchange would boost TDS's stake in U.S.
Cellular's common stock to 87.1%, from 81.5%. U.S. Cellular
said it hasn't yet reviewed the proposal.

   The proposal calls for TDS, a Chicago concern, to transfer
its service-area interests to U.S. Cellular in return for 3.5
million common shares and nine million Series A common
shares. TDS, a communications service company, would also get
paid for related investments and expenditures.
   U.S. Cellular, a Chicago-based cellular telephone systems
operator, said an independent committee of its board will
study the offer and respond. The proposal, subject to
documentation and regulatory requirements, needs the approval
of the committee and U.S. Cellular shareholders.
