   Pratt &amp; Whitney said cracks were found in 12 of its PW4000
jet engines used for wide-body jumbo jets, but that it saw no
danger to any airline passengers or problems for customers.
   The Hartford, Conn., unit of United Technologies Corp.,
said one of the 12 engines had been in service on an
airliner, but wouldn't identify the airline. Three other
engines had been shipped to aircraft makers -- two to Boeing
Co. and one to Airbus Industrie -- and the others were still
being assembled at Pratt facilities in Connecticut.

   A Pratt spokesman said the problem was traced to a
supplier in California that forged the engine shafts,
specifically to the heat-treating process used to harden
metals. He added the company began conducting emergency
inspections of engines delivered to aircraft makers or
airlines, and has found no further defects. He said the
company is cooperating with the Federal Aviation
Administration in an inquiry into the defects.
