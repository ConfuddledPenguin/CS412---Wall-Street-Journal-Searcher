   TOKYO -- Japan's oil imports in August rose 10.9% from a
year earlier, to 122.7 million barrels, according to a
preliminary report from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
   Imports were up 16.3% from July because of increasing
demand and seasonal refining factors.

   Mideast sources accounted for 86.7 million barrels, 70.7%
of the total and up 7.8% from a year earlier. Imports from
Southeast Asia grew 17.4%, to 21.2 million barrels.
   The oil from the Mideast was purchased before Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, and thus wasn't affected by Japan's
embargo on purchases of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   Some of the Southeast Asian oil was purchased after the
embargo, explaining part of that increase.
