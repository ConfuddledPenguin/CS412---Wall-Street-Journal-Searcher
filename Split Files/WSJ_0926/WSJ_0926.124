   Shares of FileNet Corp. plunged 43% after the Costa Mesa,
Calif.-based maker of document image-processing equipment
said it may report a small loss for the third quarter because
of "a significant number of delayed decisions" by potential
customers.
   "These recent delays appear to be directly related to the
increasingly negative economic environment," Ted Smith,
president and chief executive officer, said.

   FileNet shares plummeted $3.875, to close at $5.125, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday on heavy volume
of slightly more than one million shares.
   In the 1989 third quarter, FileNet had a loss of $1.8
million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $18.6 million.
For the current period, analysts had forecast profit of 14
cents to 20 cents a share, FileNet said. Revenue will be
about $5 million less than the $27 million to $28 million
analysts were predicting, the company said.
