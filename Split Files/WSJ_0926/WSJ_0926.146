   Gentex Corp. of Zeeland, Mich., and Donnelly Corp. of
Holland, Mich., said they agreed in principle to resolve a
patent dispute about an automatically dimming rearview
mirror.
   On May 10, Gentex sued Donnelly, claiming it infringed
upon the patent for the mirror sold by Gentex, and Donnelly
also filed suit, seeking a judgment that Donnelly's mirror
system didn't infringe upon Gentex's U.S. patent. In the
first half, Gentex sold 137,000 of the mirrors, which
automatically dim to eliminate headlight glare, up from
93,000 a year earlier.

   Under the agreement, Gentex would become a 50% shareholder
of Donnelly's Irish unit and Donnelly would receive newly
issued Gentex common shares to equal about a 12% stake, and
Donnelly would retain operating control of the unit. The
accord also would give Donnelly the right to buy additional
Gentex shares in the market to lift its stake 35%. If these
shares can't be acquired in the market, Donnelly would have
to option to buy enough shares from Gentex, at $11.625 each,
to reach a holding of about 30%.
