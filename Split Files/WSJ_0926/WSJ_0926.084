   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., creating a clear pattern of
succession in its top operations, named Thomas C. Graham to
the newly created position of vice chairman, steel and
diversified group.
   The 63-year-old Mr. Graham had been president of the
company's USS unit, overseeing the nation's largest steel
operations. Succeeding him in that post is Thomas J. Usher,
48, who had been executive vice president, heavy products.

   The steel and energy concern also named Robert M.
Hernandez, 46, as senior vice president, finance and
treasurer. He succeeds William E. Lewellen, 65, who is
retiring. The moves take effect Monday.
   USX has a mandatory retirement age of 65, and
steel-industry observers had been speculating about Mr.
Graham's successor for more than a year. Most speculation
centered on Mr. Usher; Reuben L. Perin Jr., 52, executive
vice president, commercial, sheet and tin; and James T.
Bradford Jr., 63, executive vice president, operations, sheet
and tin. Mr. Usher has been credited by analysts with shoring
up the company's difficult structural, plate and tubular
businesses.
   Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Usher began his career at
USX's steel business. Mr. Graham was recruited in 1983 from
LTV Corp.'s Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel unit to succeed William R.
Roesch, who was ill and died later that year. Mr. Graham, who
oversaw major shutdowns at the then-U.S. Steel during the
industry's toughest years, is largely credited with making it
one of the most profitable large steel makers in the nation.
Industry observers have speculated that Mr. Graham might be
interested in running USX's steel operations, should they be
spun off.
   With Mr. Graham's retirement from USX in sight, "it's
pretty clear that people have begun to focus more on the need
for orderly succession," said steel analyst Charles Bradford.
And the fact that Mr. Usher is a steel-operations executive
indicates the company wants to continue to "zero in on
operations," Mr. Bradford said.
   He also said the move puts Mr. Usher in place in time for
the coming negotiations with the United Steelworkers of
America, noting that Mr. Graham had been involved in shaping
previous labor pacts. USX's labor contract expires in
January.
   Mr. Usher will continue to report to Mr. Graham, who also
assumes the supervision of the company's diversified
business. Mr. Hernandez had been president of the U.S.
diversified group and had reported directly to Chairman
Charles A. Corry, 58. Mr. Hernandez, who will be responsible
for all corporate financings, domestic-project financings and
leasing activities, will now report to W. Bruce Thomas, 63,
vice chairman, administration, and chief financial officer.
   Charles C. Gedeon, 50, was named president of the U.S.
Diversified Group, replacing Mr. Hernandez, and senior vice
president, raw materials, of USS. Mr. Gedeon had been senior
vice president, related resources, for USS and USX.
