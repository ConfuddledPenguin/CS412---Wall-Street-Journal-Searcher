   Declaring that the Federal Reserve's "anti-inflationary
resolve is being tested," Fed board member Wayne Angell said
the central bank shouldn't lower interest rates now.
   Acknowledging the mounting pressure on the Fed to ease its
grip on credit amid signs of a weakening economy, Mr. Angell
warned that "hard-fought gains against inflationary
psychology achieved in the 1980s could be lost" if the Fed
moves prematurely.

   Mr. Angell's views aren't shared by all of his colleagues
at the Fed. The Fed hasn't moved interest rates since July,
and Mr. Angell was among a minority who argued against even
leaning toward lower interest rates when the Fed's
policy-making committee met in August. The committee meets
again Tuesday.
   The Fed governor stressed, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
did last week, that the Fed can't prevent the pain that
higher oil prices will cause. "Attempting, through an easing
of policy, to somehow avoid or postpone the . . . adjustments
of the oil shock would only serve to undermine" the
credibility of the Fed's pledge to bring down the inflation
rate and risk a deeper recession in the future, Mr. Angell
said.
   Mr. Angell indicated he would advocate that the Fed nudge
down the short-term interest rates it influences if the price
of gold and commodities fell, long-term interest rates
dropped and the dollar's value rose -- all signs that markets
foresee a weaker economy and less inflation. Those indicators
currently are going the other direction, suggesting that the
economy may not be as weak as some fear, Mr. Angell said.
