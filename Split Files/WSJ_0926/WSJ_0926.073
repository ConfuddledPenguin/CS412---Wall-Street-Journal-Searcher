   Deathbed utterances, like suicide notes, are a powerful
coinage, stamped by an awareness that words can outlive us.
J.M. Coetzee's latest novel, "Age of Iron" (Random House, 198
pages, $18.95), is built on just such an awareness: the
privilege of the dead, or the dying, to carry on in words.
Set in South Africa, it is the narrative of a retired
classics professor who is dying of cancer, and who devotes
the final weeks of her life to writing a long, last letter to
her only child, a daughter who has moved to America.
   But if the dying Mrs. Curren, a widowed white liberal
living alone in Cape Town, had expected to pen a letter free
of the contagion of apartheid and full of the certainties of
the educated, that illusion is shattered when she returns
from the doctor. Reeling from the news of her cancer, she
discovers an alcoholic vagrant camped in an alley beside her
garage. Filthy, taciturn, alternately sullen and solicitous,
the drunken Vercueil, whose race is never specified, is
destined to become the unlikely helpmate, confessor and
surrogate lover of her final days. And as the man to whom she
eventually entrusts the letter to be delivered to her
daughter, he is destined too to become her angel of
annunciation.

   When Mrs. Curren's black housemaid, Florence, later
arrives with her two daughters and her 15-year-old son,
Bheki, the festering consequences of apartheid begin slowly
to impinge on her world. The housemaid explains that she has
brought Bheki with her, because, "he will get into trouble"
in the townships, where the schools have been set afire and
rebellion is "burning with a low flame." Bheki and a young
schoolmate, both hardened by the oppressions of apartheid,
are driven relentlessly by the iron indignation of the
victimized.
   But what seems at first only a domestic drama spirals
rapidly into a fierce pageant of modern South Africa. Mr.
Coetzee portrays with equal vigor the insidiousness of the
apartheid system and the moral astonishment of a woman who in
her dying days is forced to witness as well as participate in
it.
   Mrs. Curren is outraged that her housemaid accepts with
placid fatalism the way in which her son and his schoolmate
have been radicalized by struggle in the townships. "Be
careful: They may start by being careless of their own lives
and end by being careless of everyone else's," she tells her.
To Florence's boast that they are "children of iron" living
in an age in which there are "no more mothers and fathers,"
Mrs. Curren pleads for the constant necessity of moral
authority. "You wash your hands of them and they turn into
the children of death," she says.
   To be sure, Mr. Coetzee has in mind more than a little
lesson on how decent societies are built on good households,
for it is clear as events unfold that no individual in the
body politic can immunize South Africa from the cancer that
is killing it. Bheki, and then his companion, are shot to
death by white policemen in separate incidents that flow so
smoothly from the logic of blind hatred that one is baffled
that the deaths can be viewed as anything but the inevitable
mechanisms of a corrupt society. Still, Mrs. Curren plunges
forward in her private crusade, scuffling with police
officers, screaming of injustice, raging like an impotent
Lear, convinced to the bitter end that shame put to words
will right the world.
   And all the while, she is succumbing slowly, sometimes in
moments of drugged hallucination, to her own cancer. What
makes the novel so powerful is how skillfully Mr. Coetzee
weaves the tale Mrs. Curren tells of South Africa with the
old woman's tortured love of her own daughter, whom she
hasn't told she has cancer.
   In one passage, she tries to bridge the thousands of miles
separating them by imagining her daughter preparing dinner:
"She empties the peas into a bowl. She takes two onions and
begins to peel them. Imagine the peas, imagine the onions.
Imagine the world in which she is doing these things. . . . a
summer evening in North America, with gnats at the screen
door, children calling from down the street. Imagine my
daughter in her house, in her life, with an onion in one
hand, in a land where she will live and die in peace."
   Ironically, "Age of Iron," Mr. Coetzee's sixth novel, is
his most explicit about apartheid, and it is published at a
time when the system is yielding slowly, but finally, to
change. It is a remarkable work by a brilliant writer,
although it lacks the sustained, if at times lunatic
intensity of his earlier novels, "In the Heart of the
Country" and "Waiting for the Barbarians." There are moments
of uneven quality in Mrs. Curren's narrative that exist
nowhere else in Mr. Coetzee's fiction, but they are minor
blemishes.
   One is haunted on finishing the novel by a doubt that
plagues Mrs. Curren throughout this swan song to her
daughter: Will the vagrant Vercueil ever deliver it to her?
In that puzzle lies a central assertion of the novel -- that
the utterances of the doomed dignify our hope for
understanding, even if no one is around to hear them.
