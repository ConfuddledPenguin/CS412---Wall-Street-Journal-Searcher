   Denver postal worker Patricia Louise Brouse wouldn't seem
the type to strike terror in the hearts of mortgage lenders.
   Hardly a Donald Trump-class borrower, she filed for
bankruptcy-law protection a year ago, listing modest first
and second mortgages as her biggest debts. Her home was worth
only half as much as the total of her mortgages, but not even
that sad legacy of Denver's housing crash was particularly
alarming to lenders. Thanks to a hands-off tradition in
bankruptcy court, mortgage companies usually dictate the
terms: our money or your house.

   But Ms. Brouse's attorney had other ideas. "If the lender
makes a stupid loan, why shouldn't he pay for it?" asked
Harold Baer Jr. To the horror of the mortgage lenders, the
judge agreed to reduce Ms. Brouse's mortgage balances to the
value of her home, slashing them from $54,000 to $27,120.
   Thrift crisis, credit crunch, glutted markets . . . now
add "cramdowns" to the list of plagues on the house of real
estate. Cramdowns, court-imposed reductions of loan balances,
have long been an unpleasant fact of life in bankruptcy court
for commercial lenders and installment-loan companies. Now,
judges in Chapter 13 cases, in which wage earners' debts are
restructured, are chopping home loans down to the current
value of the home. The remainder is converted into unsecured
debt, much to the chagrin of lenders, who typically collect
less than 10 cents on the dollar on unsecured loans in
personal bankruptcy proceedings.
   Since the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a cramdown
in an Oregon case last October, courts in Pennsylvania,
Montana, Oklahoma and Colorado have approved cramdowns. The
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals also upheld the Pennsylvania
cramdown decision. Perhaps an additional 300 cases are
pending from New Jersey to Alaska.
   The burgeoning caseload is sending shock waves through the
mortgage industry, already reeling from slumping home sales.
"It's going to be a tidal wave," predicts Michael S. Polk, a
Los Angeles attorney who represents lenders. "What we are
seeing is the beginning of a monster."
   How fearsome it becomes depends on how deeply the housing
recession bites. In 1985, the depths of the Texas housing
bust, the prices of Houston homes dropped so precipitously
that mortgage lenders faced an average $20,000 loss on each
home they sold out of foreclosure. They took to suing
homeowners to collect the deficiency -- and to discourage
them from moving away and mailing their housekeys to the
lender.
   "If we were to have a Houston in Los Angeles, there would
be a proliferation of these cases," says James M. Wooten,
chairman of Lomas Mortgage USA, a Dallas mortgage bank. "It
would be a heavy challenge for everyone involved in housing
finance."
   A cramdown epidemic would be a bigger blow to the
beleaguered thrifts and mortgage banks than the seige of
foreclosures in the Southwest. There, mortgage insurance
policies issued by the Veterans Administration, Federal
Housing Administration and private companies made full
repayments to lenders, or came close, on the low-down-payment
loans that represented the greatest risk of default.
   So far, these insurers are ducking the tab for cramdowns.
Only defaults can trigger FHA claims, says a spokesman for
the insurer, and a cramdown is not a default. If the note is
called after a cramdown, he adds, the FHA will cover only the
adjusted balance.
   The sophisticated secondary market for mortgage debt
represents another minefield for thrifts and mortgage banks.
Most home loan mortgages are purchased by quasi-public
agencies, which in turn sell securities to the public that
are backed by pools of those loans. Lenders worry that these
loans might be considered "impaired" and they could be forced
to repurchase them and swallow the losses.
   Contracts with these agencies -- the Government National
Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage
Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- all
require mortgage originators to repurchase "impaired" loans,
although there's been no test yet of whether cramdowns would
qualify. "If a judge says the loan is only worth 80 cents,"
asks William E. Cumberland, general counsel for the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America, "where does the other 20
cents come from? The system isn't designed to cope with
forgiveness of debt."
   Lenders' attorneys are painting a stark picture of a
collapse in mortgage lending in their arguments against
cramdowns, contending that they will lead inevitably to
tougher underwriting standards and higher interest rates.
After an outbreak of cramdowns in a depressed regional
economy, "you're going to wind up with the big R word --
redlining," says Mr. Polk. "What upsets me most is that the
loans most vulnerable to this are the ones designed for
first-time home buyers."
   To those who witnessed the wreckage caused by overbuilding
in the Southwest, making mortgage loans harder to get doesn't
sound like such a bad idea. "This is the other side of the
S&amp;L scam," says Mr. Baer, the Denver attorney. "If lenders
had had some risk, we wouldn't have condos all over Colorado
that shouldn't have been built."
   But in the midst of a credit crunch, lenders trying to
make a buck don't see it that way. "The lender isn't party to
an investment strategy," argues Mark A. Farmer, a lender's
attorney in Oklahoma City who has appealed two cramdown
verdicts imposed on his client, Local Federal Savings of
Oklahoma City. "Have you ever heard of a lender sharing in
the appreciation of property?"
   Lenders hope that vigorous defenses will discourage
debtors' attorneys, since there is limited cash available for
their fees in most personal bankruptcy cases. Mr. Polk also
counsels his lenders to keep watch on mortgages that have
been reduced in cramdowns. Since Chapter 13 settlements
aren't official until the schedule of payments is completed
several years later, lenders may be able to reinstate the
original mortgage if the debtor defaults a second time.
   Critics of cramdowns point out that subsequent defaults
are possible because debtors' monthly mortgage payments can't
be reduced. The bankruptcy act specifically prohibits courts
from changing the terms of loans secured by the debtor's
home.
   For Lori Anne Meyer of Mustang, Okla., the cramdown she is
seeking wouldn't shrink the onerous monthly payments that
helped drive her into Chapter 13. But if the judge approves
her petition her $41,000 mortgage would be cut by a fourth at
least, bringing her that much closer to repayment -- and
that's good enough for her. "I have made this my home," she
says. "I want to keep it."
   Court setbacks have mortgage lenders grumbling about
seeking relief from Congress. If Congress left a loophole in
the 1979 bankruptcy law, says Lomas's Mr. Wooten, "I don't
know any other solution for it than to seek an amendment."
But he hopes instead that cramdowns won't turn into an
epidemic.
   Don't bet on it. Cramdowns took off in Oklahoma City only
this summer, says debtors' attorney Melinda Monnet, but
already her colleagues at the bar are explaining the process
in solicitation letters to homeowners whose homes have been
posted for foreclosure.
