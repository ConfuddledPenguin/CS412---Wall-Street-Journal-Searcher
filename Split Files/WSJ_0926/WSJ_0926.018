   TOKYO -- NEC Corp. said it has come up with a new
fabrication process to make basic materials for large-scale
integrated chips, allowing mass production of LSI circuits
for use in supercomputers.
   Officials said the company developed the process to meet
increasing demand for computers capable of processing data
with high velocity. By concentrating computing power, LSI
chips allow manufacturers to increase speed markedly.

   Using the new process, called chemical vapor deposition,
NEC is able to build layers of ultrathin silicon and silicon
germanium for the chips at a rate 50 times faster than
conventional fabrication processes.
