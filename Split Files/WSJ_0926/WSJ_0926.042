   Your Aug. 21 page-one article on the Belzberg family
ignored the pivotal role First City Financial Co. played in
bringing public scrutiny to an unprecedented piece of
anti-shareholder legislation -- Pennsylvania's recently
enacted anti-takeover bill. As predicted, this legislation
has proved to have a deleterious effect on the stock of
companies incorporated in Pennsylvania. Further, more than
two-thirds of our major corporations have chosen to opt out
of it.
   Although our law firm no longer represents First City or
the Belzbergs, at their behest we led the lobbying efforts
against the bill. We accepted this representation because of
the clear instructions we were given: We were to take a
principled position consistent with sound public policy
representing the point of view of the major public pension
funds of this country. We were not to make a special deal
that would apply only to their investment.

   Without their involvement, providing the resources and
employing the professionals, the public pension funds would
not have been able to draw the attention of the national and
international media to this controversial bill. In so doing,
the Belzbergs performed a public service for all shareholders
and the American free-market system.
   Contrary to your reporting, because of the uproar and
resulting lengthy debate surrounding the legislation, by the
time it was signed into law more than six months after it was
introduced in the state Legislature, the provisions had
virtually no impact on the Belzbergs. For example, because of
amendments and the passage of time, the disgorgement
provision, perhaps the most controversial provision in the
bill and the one potentially most threatening to the
Belzbergs, had no practical impact on them and the bill had
no impact on the conduct of the Armstrong World Industries
Inc. proxy contest you wrote about.
   The Armstrong management's "decent job" could be
attributed to its having implemented most of the Belzbergs'
suggestions to achieve the results reported. Their
involvement in Armstrong probably benefited everyone
associated with the company except themselves.
   Most important, what goes wholly without notice is the
Belzbergs' singular service to the nation's investors and the
free-market system by opposing legislation described as the
most dangerous attack by government in America upon
capitalism in this century.

   It is true that Samuel Belzberg, along with a handful of
equally reputable operators, is trying to take water from
southern Colorado and sell it to Denver interests. But it is
misleading to suggest that the opposition to the Belzberg
scheme consists only of "ranchers . . . worried about their
wells going dry" and "a group of self-styled New Age
mystics." In fact, the regional opposition is far broader
than that. It also includes self-styled Republicans and
Baptists and agnostics, self-styled shop owners and retired
military officers, self-styled carpenters and waitresses and
schoolteachers -- even some self-styled Wall Street Journal
readers.
