   Bond International Gold Inc. said it has sold forward
810,000 ounces of gold at an average price of $425 an ounce.
The gold mining company said the average length of the
futures contracts is one year.
   The sale will allow the Denver company to cut its debt in
half in two years, the company said, and will improve its
profitability. A spokesman declined to say whether the lower
debt will make the company profitable.
