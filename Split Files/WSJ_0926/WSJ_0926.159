   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a compromise bill that
broadens the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to
gather Wall Street information and for the first time sets
guidelines for how the agency can curb forms of program
trading.
   The measure, passed by voice vote, is the first
Senate-approved legislation to include provisions about
program trading, in which computers help trade baskets of
stocks and futures on those stocks. The bill, which is
expected to breeze through the House in the next few days and
be signed by President Bush, also gives the SEC the clout to
close down the stock market in periods of extreme stress,
provided the president doesn't oppose such a move. Currently
only the president can order such a closure.

   Much of the SEC-sponsored bill is direct fallout from the
1987 crash. The bill was first proposed by the SEC under
Chairman David Ruder in 1988 but progressed slowly after
being introduced in March 1989. It then was jump-started by
the market drop in October 1989 and Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s collapse earlier this year, and reflects reactions to
those drops and the Drexel bankrupcty filing.
   One section of the bill, for example, would allow the SEC
to set up record-keeping procedures for large securities
transactions. After the 1987 crash, the SEC complained that
it didn't have sufficient information to determine risks to
the overall financial system.
   The bill also would allow the federal regulators to
strengthen the clearance and settlement system for stocks,
options and futures, again in an effort to reduce risks to
the financial markets.
   A third section would give the SEC the power to ask
brokerage firm holding companies for financial information.
The SEC has said that before the Drexel collapse, it didn't
have enough to determine data that the brokerage firm's
holding company was having liquidity problems.
   "This measure helps regain the {public's} trust by
providing regulators the tools they need to ensure the
continued integrity of our capital markets," said sponsor
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), who heads the securities
subcommittee.
   But the most intriguing section of the legislation focuses
on program trading. The measure originally was introduced in
the House by Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), who pushed the
provision through that body largely by narrowing the language
to meet concerns of other members. There was no
program-trading provision in the version of the bill the
Senate approved last month.
   Although the bill approved yesterday never mentions the
words program trading, it allows the SEC to prohibit "during
periods of extraordinary market volatility" any trading
practice that the commission has found "previously
contributed significantly to extraordinary levels of
volatility." The SEC must determine that the practice could
contribute to that type of volatility in the future. Another
section lets the agency "prescribe means reasonably designed
to prevent manipulation" of stocks or the market.
   But the measure doesn't define any of its terms about
volatility, providing the commission leeway to determine how
to enforce the provision.
   Senate staffers played down the significance of the
program-trading measure. "I think 99.99% of all program
trading will never be affected by this bill," said a Senate
securities subcommittee aide.
   But the House report on the bill said that it would allow
the agency to adopt rules similar to the one recently
inaugurated by the New York Stock Exchange on a trial basis.
That rule, which sharply limits a common form of program
trading when the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved 50
points or more, has kicked in several times over the past
month.
