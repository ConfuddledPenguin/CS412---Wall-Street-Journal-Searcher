   CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co., a bearings and steel producer,
said it will invest $170 million to improve its Canton alloy
steel production plants.
   The project is part of a $1 billion capital spending
program that Timken launched last year. The company has
detailed projects accounting for about one-third of the
money, including $210 million for its alloy and specialty
steels plants.

   Timken said it will replace a bloom continuous caster at
its Harrison Steel plant here with new casting equipment.
Also, it will improve the small bar rolling mill and bar
finishing operations at the plant. Investment in the Harrison
facility, which makes alloy steels, including some used in
Timken's bearings, will total $110 million, Timken said.
   The company said it will spend $32 million at the adjacent
five-year-old Faircrest Steel Plant to improve productivity
and product quality. And it will spend $28 million to upgrade
computer systems that serve both facilities.
   Rust International Corp. was named project manager for the
work, Timken said. Completion dates for the improvements
range from mid-1992 through mid-1993.
   Those programs, along with a previously announced $40
million investment at Timken's Latrobe specialty steel unit,
make up the bulk of the planned spending for steel plant
improvements, Timken said. When completed, they will make
Timken competitive globally in alloy and specialty steels,
both in quality and cost, the company said.
   The largest part of Timken's $1 billion investment will be
for bearings plants, but the major bearings projects haven't
been announced. The company has announced plans for building
a $23 million bearings plant in Altavista, Va., and an
investment of $13 million to modernize production of large
bearings.
