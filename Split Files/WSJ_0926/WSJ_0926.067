   GTE Corp.'s GTE Airfone unit in Oak Brook, Ill., said it
agreed to equip 150 Eastern Airlines planes with seat phones.
   Terms weren't disclosed.

<TEXT>
   The phones, to be installed on Eastern's domestic flights,
would allow passengers to place calls without leaving their
seats. The installation will be completed by mid1991.
   A trustee currently is running Eastern, which had been
part of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., Houston. GTE,
Stamford, Conn., has interests in telecommunications,
lighting-products and precision-materials.
