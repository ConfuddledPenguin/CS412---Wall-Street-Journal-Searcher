   Banco Exterior de Espana confirmed it is studying a
possible merger with Banco Hispano Americano, but denied
talks between the two Spanish banks are under way.
   "We are not in negotiations, nor do we have a merger
plan," an Exterior official said, adding that combining the
state-owned bank with Hispano would imply privatization and
require government approval. A Hispano spokesman also
emphasized that a merger with Exterior isn't in the offing.
