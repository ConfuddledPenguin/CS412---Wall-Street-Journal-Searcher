   STAMFORD, Conn. - Erbamont Inc., the U.S. affiliate of
Erbamont NV, said that Italian authorities have seized
chemotherapy production facilities of its rival Sicor S.p.a.,
the Italian supplier to Cetus Corp.
   Both Erbamont and Sicor make and sell a chemotherapy drug
doxorubicin. Erbamont sells the drug under the brand name
Adriamycin through its affiliate Adria laboratories.

   Sicor has been the target of an investigation into alleged
theft of trade secrets and materials from Erbamont's Italian
affiliate, Farmitalia Carlo Erba S.r.l. of Milan.
   Separately, Erbamont has charged Cetus with infringement
of its rights under a process patent for making doxorubicin.
Cetus has denied the charge, and an administrative law judge
for the International Trade commission last May ruled in
favor of Cetus. Erbamont appealed the decision and brought
several federal court suits over related patent disputes.
   Cetus, a biotechnology company based in Emeryville,
Calif., said impact of the action on its generic chemotherapy
drug business is uncertain. A spokeswoman added Cetus hasn't
seen any official documents about the seizure, noting that
Sicor has denied the charges.
   "Sicor currently is our sole source of bulk doxorubicin,
so unless it can open up {the plant}, or we find an alternate
supplier, it will have a substantial effect on our generic
business in the future," the spokeswoman said.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Cetus closed $7.625,
up 62.5 cents.
