   NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s big restructuring
isn't allaying the fears of one rating concern that harder
times are ahead for the nation's second-largest banking
concern.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. yesterday downgraded its
ratings on Chase's long-term debt and commercial paper.
Moody's cited the continued growth in Chase's nonperforming
real estate loans, the deteriorating Northeast economy and
the bank's exposure to other risky loans.

   But Chase shares rose 87.5 cents, to close at $12, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Volume of
more than 1.7 million shares made Chase the fourth
most-active issue on the Big Board.
   Last Friday, Chase said it will fire 5,000 employees,
provide an additional $650 million for possible loan losses,
and slash its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 62
cents. Moody's said that these actions "are positive steps,"
but that it remains concerned about Chase's exposure to
commercial real estate, less-developed countries and highly
leveraged transactions.
   Moody's said the funding and liquidity positions of both
the holding company and its Chase Manhattan Bank unit remain
sound. It also said Chase's credit standing is supported by
management's capital-building efforts and the company's
significant undervalued assets.
   Chase said it was disappointed by Moody's actions. "Even
after the aggressive action Chase took on Sept. 21, our
capital is in excess of $11 billion and our capital ratios
exceed the government's guidelines that take effect in 1992,"
the bank said in a statement. The bank also noted that as
part of its restructuring announcement last Friday, it
indicated it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be "in excess
of $140 million." Chase said earlier that as a result of the
restructuring program, it expects to report a third-quarter
pretax loss of about $625 million.
   Moody's lowered its ratings on Chase Manhattan's senior
debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2, subordinated debt to Ba-2 from
Baa3; preferred stock to Ba-2 from Baa-3, and commercial
paper to prime-3 from prime2.
