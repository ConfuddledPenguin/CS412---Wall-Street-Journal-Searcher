   A federal jury in Norfolk, Va., convicted a Christian
Broadcasting Network Inc. technician on two counts for
cutting into a Playboy Channel movie with a Biblical message
to repent.
   A CBN spokeswoman said that the Federal Communications
Commission failed to establish conclusively that Thomas M.
Haynie had interrupted the Playboy Channel transmission and
that Mr. Haynie intends to appeal. Neither Mr. Haynie nor his
attorneys were available for comment. The case was handled by
the FCC and the Justice Department.

   Mr. Haynie was indicted in April on six counts alleging
that he sent transmissions over CBN equipment that
interrupted both Playboy Channel and American Exxxtasy
programming on Sept. 6, 1987. The message to viewers: "Thus
sayeth the Lord thy God. Remember the Sabath (sic) and keep
it holy. Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
   The count of intentionally interfering with a
communications satellite, a felony, carries a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Unauthorized use of a satellite uplink transmitter is a
misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a
$100,000 fine.
