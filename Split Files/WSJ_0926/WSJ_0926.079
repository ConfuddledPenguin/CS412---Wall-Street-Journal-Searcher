   NEW YORK -- A delegation of Soviet Union businessmen, who
this month helped start the first commodity exchange in
Moscow since the mid-1920s, came to see Wall Street with
their own eyes.
   "It's a crazy house]" exclaims Victor Zaplatkin, a member
of the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce, after gawking around the
New York Stock Exchange's trading floor for a few minutes
Monday afternoon.

   The Big Board is a far cry from the embryonic Moscow
market. Last Wednesday, 200 Soviets gathered in a Moscow
office building to trade whatever any of them wanted to buy
and sell, which turned out to be mostly building materials,
such as cement and lumber. It resembled an auction more than
a Western-style securities or futures exchange.
   The Soviets knew they had a long way to go even before the
seven visitors ventured to Wall Street. One highlight of
their two-week tour: mock trading of platinum futures last
night on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   "It's better to see it done once than hear it a thousand
times," says Mr. Zaplatkin, quoting a Russian proverb.
   There are a few little problems to iron out back home
before the Moscow market goes big time, however. "Until we
resolve the question of property ownership, it will be hard
to resolve any market questions," says Gennadi Poleshuk,
co-chairman of the Moscow Commodity Exchange. He argues a
commodity exchange could help improve the Soviet Union's poor
system for distributing goods.
   Another difficulty is that to function properly, futures
markets need risk-takers -- also known as speculators, which
is an onerous term in the Soviet Union. Such activity is
illegal and people convicted of it are subject to stiff
prison sentences.
   A proposal to change the law on speculation has been
introduced, says Alexander Pochinok, a deputy of the Supreme
Soviet of the Russian Republic and secretary of the
commission on budget, taxes, securities and banking
legislation for the republic. "However," he adds, "it is much
more difficult to change the consciousness of the people."
   Konstantin Zatulin, a member of the board of the exchange
and head of an association of entrepreneurs, says the Soviet
people "are moving from a complete denial of the market -- an
attitude they held for 70 years -- to viewing it as their
salvation."
   To help them learn how markets work, the Soviets have
hired two Americans. One of them is Danielle Downing, a
recent Russian-speaking graduate from the MBA program at the
Wharton Business School, who is executive assistant to the
chairman of the new exchange and is based in Moscow.
   "I see the Moscow exchange developing in a pattern similar
to the way American exchanges developed," first trading
warehouse receipts for real bushels of grain or tons of
metal, then evolving into futures markets, she said. Her
boss, Mr. Poleshuk, predicts the new auction-type marketplace
will evolve into a futures market when goods become freely
priced, in five to seven years.
   John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry
Association, says he believes there would be world-wide
commercial interest in a Soviet futures market that traded
energy products, precious metals and the ruble.
   The government of the Russian Republic has passed a law
that, beginning late this year, will permit all Soviet
enterprises, but not individuals, to trade foreign
currencies. According to Ms. Downing, the Moscow exchange is
in good position to become one of the places where such
trading is permitted. It would start as a cash market for the
ruble against all the major Western currencies.
