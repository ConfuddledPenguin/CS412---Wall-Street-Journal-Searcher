   NEW YORK -- Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. charged a former
employee and two Chicago companies with copyright
infringement and unfair competition in business information
services.
   The business information company, in a lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court in Chicago, charges that International
Business Lists Inc., Inter-Direct Inc. and Gary E. Walter
improperly copied a database of U.S. businesses and their
executives compiled by D&amp;B and sold it to their customers.

   The suit also charges that Mr. Walter breached an
agreement not to compete with D&amp;B for two years after he left
the company. The suit says Mr. Walter left D&amp;B around Sept.
1, 1988.
   D&amp;B's lawsuit seeks to stop the defendants from marketing
the data, and it asks for unspecified damages. Mr. Walter,
president of International Business Lists, called D&amp;B's
charges "absolutely untrue." Inter-Direct is the former name
of International Business Lists, he said.
