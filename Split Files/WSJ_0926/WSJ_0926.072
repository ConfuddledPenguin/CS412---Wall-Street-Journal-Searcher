   NEW YORK -- Stock prices rebounded from Monday's sell-off
as oil prices retreated and speculators who had bet that
stocks would keep falling rushed to cut their losses.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.67 points in
moderate trading to 2485.64, but advancing issues on the New
York Stock Exchange barely outnumbered decliners, 770-745.

   The slump in oil-crude oil futures for November delivery
fell 72 cents a barrel to $37.53 -- also boosted bond prices,
though trading was light. The dollar rose against the mark
and fell against the yen on a West German official's comment
that the yen could strengthen against European currencies.
   Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading at
Shearson Lehman Brothers, said yesterday's rally was fueled
mainly by short-sellers -- investors who had bet on a further
decline from Monday's level. When a drop failed to
materialize, these investors sought to trim their losses by
buying back shares.
   Oil's drop attracted some bargain hunters to stocks, and
they pushed prices high enough to spark the short-covering
rally.
   Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers, said he wasn't surprised to see the
rebound. He explained that Monday's drop -- in which the Dow
Jones industrials lost 59.41 points to close at their lowest
level of the year -- came on less volume and with fewer
stocks reaching new lows than on Aug. 23, the day of the
industrials' previous 1990 low. Trading "will remain very
choppy," he said, "but the downside risk is starting to
diminish."
   But others weren't convinced yesterday's rally has staying
power. "The broad list of stocks continues to receive a
considerable amount of selling pressure even during sporadic
short-term rally attempts," said Mr. Grennan at Shearson.
   Jack Solomon, market technician at Bear Stearns, said he
has noticed increased investor interest in shorting stocks --
or borrowing shares and selling them, in hope of profiting
from a price decline. "Everybody wants to go short who never
went short before," he said.
   But Mr. Solomon also said that oil won't rise further for
the time being; he noted that oil-company stocks haven't
followed oil to higher prices.
   In fact, Sal Gilbertie, an oil futures trader at Merrill
Lynch, said Monday's surge in oil was a "purely emotional
high based on war fears" in the Middle East. Yesterday,
common sense -- and profit-taking -- prevailed. "There are
ample levels of heating oil in the world," Mr. Gilbertie
said. "New York harbor is filled to the brim with tankers
loaded with heating oil."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. Big Board volume was 155.9 million
shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face
amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
eased to 9.13%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5725 marks, up from 1.5590 late
Monday, and at 136.72 yen, down from 137.35.
