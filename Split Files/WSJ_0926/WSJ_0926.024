   TOKYO -- After years of low visibility in Japan, Apple
Computer Inc. is scrambling to boost its presence here --
pumping up personal computer sales, seeking potential
partners and courting investors.
   "We're growing at over a 100% rate" annually in Japan,
said John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer. "Apple
Japan will be our largest subsidiary outside of the U.S."

   The company's board of directors is meeting for the first
time at Apple Japan's headquarters this week, and Mr. Sculley
will present to them his blueprint for boosting Japanese
sales to $1 billion annually by the mid-1990s, up from about
$250 million currently. Mr. Sculley also is visiting Japan
for the listing this month of Apple's stock on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   Apple is among the most prominent of a growing group of
American hardware and software PC companies jumping into the
Japanese market.
   The Japanese PC market is far less developed than either
the U.S. or European markets, but many analysts think sales
in Japan are taking off, presenting a wide opportunity for
U.S. companies such as Apple -- particularly as their home
market slows down. "The market for the Apple Macintosh in
Japan has so far largely been personal users and
enthusiasts," said David Ushijima, who is helping to launch a
Japanese version of Macworld, an Apple computing magazine, in
November. "There's now a shift toward professional buyers and
business people."
   Apple set up its Japanese subsidiary in 1983, but got off
to a slow start, running through four presidents in its early
years, offering only limited Japanese language capabilities
and charging prices considered high even for the expensive
Japanese market.
   Now its strategy is changing. The company lured a Japanese
executive away from Toshiba Corp. to run its Tokyo
operations, and has a lineup of Japanese language products.
While there has traditionally been a lag between introducing
new products in the U.S. and in Japan, this year's new
products will come out in Japan "almost simultaneously" with
the U.S., executives say.
   In addition to increasing sales, Mr. Sculley indicated he
is looking for more Japanese partnerships, possibly for
sharing technology. He said Apple has a "treasure chest" of
technologies to offer possible partners, although he declined
to give details. He added that he was particularly interested
in the Japanese strengths in "miniaturizing" computers into
laptops and notebooks.
   Although Mr. Sculley said Apple doesn't need more capital,
he hopes the listing on the Tokyo exchange will draw more
Japanese investment. In the U.S., he said, "hi-tech stocks
are trading stocks. I prefer to see investors in it for the
long term. One of the things I admire about Japanese industry
is its ability to invest in building."
