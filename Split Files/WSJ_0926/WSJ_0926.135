   Benetton added that it expects consolidated revenue for
all of 1990 to exceed 2 trillion lire. Revenue totaled 1.657
trillion lire in 1989. The company didn't give an earnings
forecast.
   Operating earnings advanced 13% to 138.2 billion lire from
122.3 billion lire, Benetton said.
   The sharp increase in sales reflected, in part, a rapid
expansion in East Asian markets, particularly in South Korea
and Japan. Sales in the U.S. increased 5.7%, the company
added.
