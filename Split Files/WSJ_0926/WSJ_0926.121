   A group that includes Acadia Partners L.P. and Robert M.
Bass Group Inc. said it raised its stake in Vons Cos. to
15.9% of common shares outstanding. Vons is a supermarket
chain based in Arcadia, Calif.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group said it holds 6,163,648 Vons shares, including
476,300 shares purchased between Aug. 6 and Sept. 21 for
$18.50 to $19.55 a share.

   Vons closed yesterday in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange at $19.125 a share, down 37.5 cents.
   A Vons spokeswoman didn't have any comment on the filing.
The investors currently hold two seats on Vons' board.
Acadia's managing general partner, Peter T. Joseph, has been
a Vons director since 1987, and Vons gave Acadia and Bass
Group a second seat after they bought a 7.5% stake in the
company from Warburg, Pincus Associates L.P. last year.
