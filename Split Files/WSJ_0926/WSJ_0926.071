   An Irish paper company said it will build a $400 million
plant in upstate New York that would recycle old newspapers
into newsprint.
   Dublin-based Jefferson Smurfit Group, one of the largest
producers of recycled paper and paperboard products, said it
plans to build a mill that would recycle 330,000 tons of
waste paper a year into newsprint, said a company spokesman.
The plant could be built and running in five years, the
spokesman said. Sites in upstate New York are being
considered but state and company officials refused to
identify them.

   Smurfit Recycling Co., a St. Louis-based unit of the Irish
parent, will collect newspapers from across the Northeast for
use at the mill. Smurfit already operates three paper
recycling mills, one in California and two in Oregon.
