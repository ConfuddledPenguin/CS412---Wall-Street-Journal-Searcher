   NEW YORK -- Leon J. Karvelis, chief analyst and head of
business development at municipal-bond insurer MBIA Inc.,
sold 90% of his stock in the company in late August,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   His sale, of 4,500 shares valued at $157,500, preceded the
huge hit the stock has taken recently on worries over the
financial stability of Philadelphia in particular, and of
state and local governments in general. MBIA has insured $122
million of the troubled city's bonds, which now carry "junk"
credit ratings, plus an even larger amount of municipals
whose interest payments are tied to revenue from
Philadelphia's operations.

   Mr. Karvelis sold his shares at $35 a share on Aug. 23,
SEC filings show. Since then, the stock has fallen 29%; it
closed yesterday at $25, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Mr. Karvelis, a well-known figure in the municipal bond
market who serves as chairman of the National Federation of
Municipal Bond Analysts, couldn't be reached for comment. The
sale was his second, and largest, stock sale since the
company went public in 1987, according to SEC filings.
Earlier in August, the filings show, Mr. Karvelis purchased
1,000 MBIA shares.
   David Elliott, president of MBIA, declined to comment
about the sale by Mr. Karvelis. Other company insiders have
used the stock's decline as a buying opportunity, although
their purchases have yet to be reported to the SEC, he said.
   As for the price of the company's stock, Mr. Elliott said,
"we've been swept up in the overall skittishness in the
market over financial services companies," such as troubled
banks, "even though we're a horse of a different color."
   The executive added that "it is not our belief that there
will be a default" by Philadelphia. And even if Philadelphia
were to default, MBIA could withstand it, he said.
   Richard Ciccarone, head of fixed-income research of Kemper
Capital Markets Inc. of Chicago, agreed. MBIA's exposure in
the event of a default by Philadelphia on all of its
MBIA-insured bonds would be roughly $9 million a year in debt
service, an amount that "would be definitely bearable" by the
company, Mr. Ciccarone said. Thus, to some degree, he said,
the stock's decline "may be a bit overplayed."
   Still, Mr. Ciccarone said, the stock market's worry is
that if Philadelphia could default, so could other municipal
bond issuers.
   According to MBIA, roughly 3% of the $70.6 billion of
municipals the firm has insured are on its "watch" list for
any changes in status.

   FAMILY MATTERS: The largest insider purchase reported to
the SEC in the latest week was made by Robert H. McKinney,
chairman of Somerset Group, an Indianapolis holding company
with interests in radio stations and building materials,
among other businesses. The company also holds a 23% stake in
First Indiana Bank.
   As shown in the accompanying Insider Trading Spotlight,
Mr. McKinney increased his direct holdings in the company by
22% with a $1 million private purchase of 122,063 shares on
Aug. 30 (see accompanying table -- WSJ Sept. 26, 1990). His
interest in the company also includes 92,967 shares owned
indirectly by his wife, his children and through a trust, SEC
filings show.
   A spokeswoman for the company said Mr. McKinney bought the
shares from family members, primarily nieces and nephews. Mr.
McKinney was unavailable for comment.
   He paid about $8.25 a share. In over-the-counter trading
Somerset Group shares closed yesterday at $6 a share, down 25
cents.

   SALE ON COOKWARE: Two insiders at Williams-Sonoma Inc.,
the San Francisco-based retailer of gourmet cookware and
appliances, sold a total of 80,000 shares for more than $2
million in late July, according to SEC filings.
   The insider sales were part of the company's public
offering of 1.4 million of shares last July, said James
Reilly, chief financial officer. The $21 million in proceeds
from the sale was used to pay down short-term debt and to
fund store openings and expansions, he said. The chain will
open 15 new stores by year's end, expanding its operations to
148 stores nationwide.
   Of the 1.4 million shares sold in the offering, 513,000
were sold by insiders, but all their filings have not yet
been received by the SEC, Mr. Reilly said.
   The filings show Patrick Connolly, a director and vice
president of the mail-order division, sold 50,000 shares on
July 31 at $25.50 a share. The stock represented 17% of his
company holdings, SEC filings show. The same day, Charles E.
Williams, a founder of the company and vice chairman of the
board, sold 30,000 shares. He has 132,000 shares remaining,
SEC filings show. The two executives weren't available for
comment.
   In national over-the-counter trading, the company's shares
closed yesterday at $14.25, down 25 cents.
