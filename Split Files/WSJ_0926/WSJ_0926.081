   The builders of Bell Atlantic Corp.'s new tower in
Philadelphia had a tricky problem: finding 300,000 square
feet of red granite and a factory that would process the
stone in time to meet an exacting construction schedule.
   Help came from Malcolm Swenson, a man who knows his
quarries. He found a Swedish quarry that could produce the
type of granite needed at the right price and an Italian
factory that could process it quickly. The result: A lot of
rocks got a lot of travel. But the granite fabrication was
completed on schedule at a savings of $500,000 over Bell
Atlantic's initial $3 million cost projection, Mr. Swenson
says.

   The entrepreneur runs a company based in Grantham, N.H.,
that fills a niche so narrow it scarcely exists: stone
consulting. While experts on entrepreneurship often advise
finding an uncrowded market niche, owners such as Mr. Swenson
profit handsomely by taking the advice about as far as it can
go.
   In New York, Arlen Lessin now runs a firm that advises
large corporations only on "managing innovation." In Beverly
Hills, Calif., entrepreneur Richard Myers is about to open a
Rodeo Drive store that will sell nothing but technically
advanced makeup and shaving mirrors -- for as much as $8,400
apiece.
   "Niche businesses can be very attractive," says Mary Ellen
Jay of Kenny, Kindler, Hunt &amp; Howe, a New York executive
search and consulting firm. "There isn't the need for as
significant an amount of capital as is often necessary in
going after larger markets. And it's far less competitive."
   Many of these niches are too small to accommodate more
than one or two competitors. There are psychic rewards too:
In a very narrow field, an entrepreneur might easily become
his region's -- and maybe even the world's -- leading expert.
   Niche businesses also provide more flexibility in the
price an entrepreneur can charge. "You are providing
something that no one else has," says Mr. Myers, whose
cheapest shaving mirror sells for $175.
   Entrepreneurs often find these narrow niches through work
in related fields. Mr. Swenson, the stone consultant, says
his grandfather emigrated from Sweden in the 1860s and
purchased a granite quarry in Concord, N.H., in 1883. Mr.
Swenson took over the family business in 1968 after receiving
an M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School. But when the
company ran into trouble a few years later, he quit and began
helping to open quarries in China and the Middle East. Later,
Mr. Swenson worked for a large construction company and its
stone subsidiary. But he left in 1988 to launch Swenson Stone
Consultants with his brother, David. Their niche was to help
developers and their architects select and buy the right
stones.
   The Swensons say they keep tabs on every major quarry and
stone processing plant in the world and can save builders
time and money when it comes to rocks. When the developers of
New York's Equitable Tower had trouble finding a uniform
color of stone and the appropriate size, Mr. Swenson's firm
stepped in. They found a quarry in Brazil that could produce
the stone in the exact color and size needed. But to get the
marble processed in time, they had to find two separate
factories in two separate countries with identical polishing
methods.
   As stone expertise is none too common, the Swensons say
they get business from all over the world. With the U.S.
construction business in a slump, the company is working with
clients in England, France and Germany. Mr. Swenson says
clients paid the company more than $500,000 for its rock
advice last year.
   But esoteric niches have their problems too. "It's not
always clear to people what our business really is," says Mr.
Lessin, the "innovation facilitator." He spends a lot of time
explaining that innovation management involves introducing
new ideas throughout a company's rank and file without
disrupting day-to-day operations.
   Mr. Lessin and his staff help companies explain such
things as why a new product or practice is really important,
why everyone should support it -- and why the people
associated with the old product or practice weren't
necessarily dolts.
   Mr. Lessin says he benefits from his own experience in
developing new products and ideas for a number of major
companies as well as his own high-tech startup. In 1983, Mr.
Lessin launched SmartCard International Inc. to help develop
and market the smart card, a card with a computer chip that
uses advanced data processing techniques. He took the company
public in 1986 but then left to start Lessin Technology Group
Inc. in New York.
   Working a narrow niche can be particularly tricky for
entrepreneurs selling a consumer product, such as Mr. Myers,
president of French Reflection Inc., Los Angeles. The mirror
importer, who is opening the Beverly Hills mirror boutique,
is gambling on a single high-priced product, France's Brot
mirror.
   Mr. Myers and his wife began importing these mirrors after
discovering them in a Paris hotel room in 1980. For those who
really care about their makeup, the mirrors offer optical
quality glass and -- for more money -- a built-in light. They
swivel, resist steaming up in the bathroom, avoid distortion
and come in dozens of varieties. Some magnify your features
or have goldplated frames. Selling mostly to interior
decorators and through direct mail, French Reflection says
sales have grown to more than $4 million annually.
   Mr. Myers says buyers have included a number of movie and
TV stars as well as several luxury hotels. The mirror "fits
in with the upscale European look the hotels want to
achieve," he explains.
   Of course, entrepreneurs in very narrow niches sometimes
think of diversification. But Mr. Myers has no intention of
moving away from the mirror niche he has carefully cultivated
over the past four years. It would be possible to sell other
bathroom products as well, but "that's not what I want to
do," says the mirror loyalist. "I believe too strongly in the
potential of these mirrors to try anything else."
