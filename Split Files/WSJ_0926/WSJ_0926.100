   MERIDEN, Conn. -- Bank holding company Cenvest Inc. said
it will make a special $5.4 million third-quarter provision
for possible loan losses, a move stemming largely from the
state's weak commercial real estate market.
   For the year-earlier third period, Cenvest posted a net
loss of $1.5 million, or 39 cents a share. Cenvest shares
didn't trade yesterday on the national over-the-counter
market. They last closed at $2.375.
