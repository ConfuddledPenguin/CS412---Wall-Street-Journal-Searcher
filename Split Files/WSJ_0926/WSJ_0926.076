   Just how close is Iraq to acquiring nuclear weapons?
Nobody knows for sure.
   Only nine months ago, Tel Aviv University's Jaffa Center
for Strategic Studies estimated that Iraq was "five to 10
years" from obtaining the bomb, with Iraqi progress in this
area constituting "a new level of the military threat"
hovering over the region. The U.S. intelligence community
agreed. But shortly before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the
Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency broke ranks and
revised its estimate downward. Iraq was now only "two to five
years" away from a nuclear capability, the DIA said.

   France, which has closely monitored Iraq's nuclear
programs as one of its principal suppliers for many years,
has revised its estimate as well. In recent interviews,
French officials said they believed Iraq could "go nuclear"
in three years or more. One of their biggest worries is that
these facilities are so small that even the best
reconnaissance satellites might never pick them up, officials
said.
   Iraq's nuclear research program began in the early 1960s,
when the first Baathist government purchased an experimental
nuclear reactor from the U.S.S.R. To house the modest-sized
plant, Iraq built its first nuclear research center, some 15
miles south of Baghdad. Later, the Soviets upgraded this
light-water research reactor and trained at least 100 Iraqi
nuclear physicists. They also delivered three "hot cells"
capable of manipulating spent fuel, and built a laboratory
capable of producing medical radio-isotopes. But Leonid
Brezhnev refused subsequent Iraqi pleas to purchase more
advanced technology, and Iraq turned to France.
   In September 1975, Saddam met with Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac in Paris, to negotiate a wide range of arms-for-oil
deals. Among them was the purchase of two nuclear research
reactors. To the French, Saddam said he was interested in
civilian nuclear power. But in an interview with a Beirut
magazine, El Usbou el-Arabi, he described the agreement with
France as "the first concrete step toward the production of
the Arabic atomic weapon."
   The contract to purchase the Osiris and Isis reactors
(later designated as "Tammouz I" and "Tammouz II") was signed
in Baghdad two months later. These deliveries, coupled with
the sale by Italy in 1980 of four hot cells capable of
extracting weapons-grade plutonium from spent reactor fuel,
were considered so critical that in June 1981 Israel sent in
air force jets, which totally destroyed the core of the
Tammouz I reactor. Tammouz II, which was a scale model for
nuclear experiments, emerged intact and today appears to be
operational.
   Repeated attempts to convince the French to rebuild
Tammouz I have failed. And yet, Iraq continues its nuclear
weapons program unabated. Only now, these efforts are
occurring underground.
   At first, in the 1970s and early 1980s, the Iraqis built
large-scale nuclear plants capable of irradiating highly
enriched uranium, which could then be reprocessed in hot
cells to obtain weapons-grade plutonium. But not only were
the nuclear materials and equipment Iraq purchased subject to
International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, which
occurred every six months, but the installations themselves
were large, easy to identify, and difficult to defend.
   In 1983, Iraqi nuclear engineers changed tactics. Using a
clandestine technology-procurement network in Europe, Africa
and the Americas, they set about acquiring critical
technologies needed to build an indigenous uranium-enrichment
industry, based on gas centrifuges.
   This method involves turning large quantities of uranium
yellowcake into a gas, called uranium hexofluoride, and
spinning the gas in specially designed ultracentrifuges until
the desired level of purification can be obtained. Uranium
thus enriched to more than 90% can then be directly used to
build atomic weapons.
   Ultracentrifuge technology may be complex, but it is
widely available and relatively easy to conceal. Pakistan
seems to have taken this route; China mastered it; Brazil
opened its own ultracentrifuge enrichment plant two years
ago, using West German technology. All of these countries may
have contributed to the Iraqi program. And there is little
the IAEA or anyone else can do about it. These are
clandestine facilities, fueled by vast quantities of
unsafeguarded uranium yellowcake obtained from Niger, Brazil
and Portugal in the late 1970s, and extracted from Iraq's own
plant at al Qaim in recent years.
   Several warning lights have appeared recently, providing a
disturbing glimpse into Iraq's clandestine nuclear program:
   -- In March, British and American customs agents
coordinated to intercept 40 krytron nuclear triggers on their
way to Iraq. Krytrons are essential for detonating a nuclear
device.
   -- In July, in another joint British-American operation,
high-temperature "skull furnaces" manufactured by Consarc
Engineering, in Rancocas, N.J., were intercepted on their way
to Iraq. These furnaces can be used both for nuclear and
ballistic missile programs.
   -- In August, the Swiss firm Schmiedemeccanica tried to
deliver endcaps made of special maraging steel to Iraq.
Endcaps are a critical part of ultracentrifuges.
   -- Since 1987, a West German engineering firm, H&amp;H
Metalform, has been delivering to Iraq sophisticated
machine-tools capable of making ultracentrifuges in Iraq,
according to the German newsweekly Der Spiegel. In
conjunction with this crucial sale, which was never blocked,
Iraq has also purchased from West German and
French-controlled companies large quantities of the special
steels needed to manufacture the centrifuges.
   West European nuclear experts have little doubt: Iraq has
opted for the centrifuge technique, and the spate of recent
purchases proves Iraq's intentions.
   But even government nuclear experts admit they do not know
the full scope of the Iraqi purchases. "We see things getting
stopped, but we have no idea how much of it is actually
getting through," one French expert said. "We know the Iraqis
are masters of clandestine procurement, and they have an
extremely detailed shopping list. We see the pattern in their
purchases, but we can't see the timetable. They seem to be
buying whatever they can find whenever it becomes available."
   Iraq surprised the world once, in the development of its
indigenous ballistic missiles. Clearly, with his nuclear
ambitions, Saddam would like to surprise us again.
