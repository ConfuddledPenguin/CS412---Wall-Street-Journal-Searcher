   NEW YORK -- CBS narrowly won the prime-time ratings race
for the first week of the 1990-91 television season, its
first weekly victory since January 1987.
   According to figures compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co., CBS
Inc.'s network, which has ranked third among the three major
networks for three consecutive years, finished the week with
an average rating of 13.6% of U.S. homes and a 23% share of
the nightly viewing audience. A unit of General Electric Co.,
the NBC network, which has been No. 1 for five years, ran
second in the week with a 13.4 rating and 23 share. Capital
Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC network was third with a 13.2 rating
and 22 share. And News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co., with
five nights of programming, had a 5 rating and 8 share. (A
ratings point represents 931,000 or 1% of the nation's TV
households; shares are the percentage of sets in use.)

   In other ratings news, the first two installments of "The
Civil War," a 12-hour series broadcast on the Public
Broadcasting Service, set a record as the largest audience
ever for a PBS program. On Monday, it registered a 9.1 rating
and 13 share, according to overnight Nielsen ratings from 24
major markets.
   Despite the strong showing by CBS in prime time, the "CBS
Evening News with Dan Rather" slid into third place,
attracting 8.5% of U.S. homes. ABC's newscast was in first
place for the 37th week with 10.3% of homes, and NBC was
second with 8.8%.
