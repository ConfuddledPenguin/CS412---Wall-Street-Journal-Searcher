   As the IMF and World Bank convene their annual meetings in
Washington, it is important to recognize that the outlook for
U.S. financial markets largely hinges on the fate of the
dollar. This is why the U.S. Treasury Department's policy of
malign neglect of the dollar is so disturbing. The Treasury
has accepted a silent devaluation of the dollar of nearly 10%
on a trade-weighted basis during the spring and summer
quarters. Over the past 15 months the dollar's value has
dropped 16%. If this ominous trend continues, the world
financial system and its underlying economies are likely to
suffer enormously, with consequences far more lasting than
the Middle East's temporary oil price shock.
   Recent history shows clearly that a sinking dollar raises
inflation fears, drives up interest rates, undermines
economic growth and destabilizes financial markets. Recall
the October 1987 stock market crash following that summer's
breakdown of international currency cooperation. Recall also
the October 1989 mini-crash, following the G-7's decision a
month earlier to engage in dollar-bashing.

   Foreign investors have grown weary of the enlarged
currency risk associated with the purchase of U.S. financial
instruments, including commercial bank liabilities. That is
one reason that foreign capital inflows have virtually dried
up. Recent Commerce Department data show that on balance net
foreign purchases of securities registered an outflow of
capital at an $18 billion annual rate so far this year,
compared with a $48 billion inflow in 1989.
   Domestic investors, who instinctively pull back on the
news of foreign withdrawal, also regard weakness in the
dollar as a market signal of rising expectations of future
inflation. Such expectations are the bane of financial
assets. And these concerns are not without merit.
   A comparison of internationally traded goods shows that
the year-to-year change in producer prices in the U.S. is
5.1%, while Germany registered 1.5% over the past 12 months
and Japan's rate was 1.1%. Purchasing power parity models
suggest a proper dollar valuation of between 150 to 170 yen
and 1.80 and 2.00 marks. So long as the dollar remains below
these levels, it is reasonable to assume that the U.S. will
continue to inflate more rapidly than its major competitors.
In the event, this reduces the expected future value of U.S.
financial assets and causes the dollar to depreciate against
other currencies.
   Regrettably, the U.S. Treasury seems pleased with the
steady erosion of the dollar's purchasing power. Treasury
Under Secretary David Mulford recently reconfirmed his easy
money philosophy by saying that the decline in the dollar has
been "orderly" and is of no concern to the Treasury. Mr.
Mulford believes that a lower dollar will help reduce the
U.S. trade deficit. Every time this head-in-the-sand policy
is articulated, it puts downward pressure on the
international demand for dollars.
   All this leaves the Federal Reserve as the last bastion to
protect the dollar. What the central bank must now do is to
make public its clear commitment to domestic price stability
by protecting the dollar. In recent testimony before the
Joint Economic Committee, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted
of this, but the point must be made with greater clarity. In
the best of all worlds, this strategy should be pursued with
the cooperation of the other G-7 central banks.
   Operationally, the Fed must also make it clear that it
will use financial and commodity market price indicators to
guide the management of money creation and the federal funds
rate. Mr. Greenspan also hinted at this in his JEC testimony,
when he told Congress that the Fed would be inclined to ease
if the bond market reacted positively to a budget deal. This
implies the use of a market price rule as a standard of
monetary value, but here too the policy would be far more
credible if the point were made with greater clarity.
   Since mid-June, the weekly average market price of gold
has moved from $346 to $400. The first $20 of this upward
move occurred before the rise of oil prices. Since then,
Treasury bond yields have jumped 74 basis points, from 8.42%
to 9.16%, while the yield curve has widened from a spread of
only 12 basis points in mid-June to 126 basis points
recently. While the dollar has steadily weakened, the Dow
Jones average has plummeted from 2924 in the week ending June
15th to its current level of around 2450, a drop of roughly
460 points. At the same time, monetary base growth has
accelerated to an annual rate of 8%-12% in the past three
months.
   Under these circumstances, a clear Fed commitment to a
market price rule strategy warrants a minor tightening to
make money relatively scarce, not an easing. Not a major
tightening move, but an increase of perhaps 25 to 50 basis
points in the federal funds rate to signal a clear commitment
to protect the dollar and reinforce the goal of domestic
price stability.
   Markets would react immediately by selling gold and buying
dollars. With massive dollar short positions reported, a
clear message from the Fed would quickly push the dollar up
toward purchasing power parity. Long-term rates would fall as
investors began to fear inflation less.
   While it may appear counter-intuitive, timely Fed action
would actually stimulate the economy. Here's the logic. The
weakest part of the U.S. economy is housing and real estate.
Nearly 64% of Americans own their own homes, and it is the
value of those homes -- not the value of the stock market (in
which only 20% of Americans have direct ownership) -- that
affects family spending decisions. The slump in real estate
and home prices, whose value has dropped nearly $1 trillion
in the past two years, has therefore badly damaged consumer
confidence, which has plummeted 30% over the past 13 months.
   This, in turn, has caused a major cutback in consumer
spending. Real consumer purchases have declined in seven of
the past 12 months. There are of course many other factors
affecting confidence, such as federal, state and local tax
threats, regulatory policies, concerns over the financial
system, the Middle East situation and so forth. But the real
estate-housing slump hurts consumer confidence most.
   High-tax fiscal policies also play a major role in
determining currency values, though not one in a thousand
market gurus seem to understand this. Rising tax burdens
lower the future path of profits, employment, new business
formation and economic growth. As such, these supply-side
effects reduce the marginal utility of money and the demand
for dollars. By making goods scarce, high tax policies render
the existing stock of money more inflationary.
   The dollar has suffered from market fears that punitive
tax increases will weaken the future rate of return on U.S.
assets. Threats of a security transfer tax, a higher marginal
tax rate on personal income or a stiff surcharge on personal
income taxes all erode economic incentives, efficiency and
productivity. What's more, schemes to eliminate the mortgage
interest deduction and the state and local deduction are
being proposed at exactly the wrong moment. While there is
considerable merit in eliminating inefficient tax subsidies,
these are future tax reform items that should be offset by a
drop in the personal income tax rate.
   If hard money actions were accompanied by a reduction in
the capital gains tax rate, a greater rate-of-return and a
lower investment hurdle rate would boost the value of all
U.S. assets, including real estate, stocks and bonds, and
revive risk-taking, entrepreneurship and sagging animal
spirits throughout the economy. Policymakers should also move
toward a reduction in the Social Security tax rate to raise
after tax take-home pay and work incentives for middle and
lower middle-income families. In addition, officials should
recognize that reduced business spending and profitability is
partly a function of excessive corporate tax rates and
unnecessarily long capital cost recovery periods.
   This is the surest path to budget deficit reduction in the
1990's: a comprehensive program that (i) strictly limits the
real growth of federal spending through an enforceable budget
freeze; (ii) restores economic growth and replenishes revenue
flows with a series of tax rate reductions for capital,
families and businesses (off-set by the elimination of major
tax subsidies); and (iii) substantially lowers interest rates
and federal debt-service costs by announcing and maintaining
a market price rule to insure domestic price stability.
