   MURRAY HILL, N.J. -- Airco Gases is adding a surcharge on
all delivered industrial-gas products, affecting as many as
10,000 customers.
   Airco, a U.S. unit of BOC Group of Britain, also expects
it will have to boost list prices on all industrial-gas
products between 6% and 10% before year's end. A spokeswoman
attributed the added charges to increases in oil prices and
their impact on distribution costs.

   Merchant liquid oxygen and nitrogen consumers will pay a
surcharge of three-quarters of one cent per 100 cubic feet
for large-tank deliveries and as much as two cents for
lower-volume customers. The charge on argon and hydrogen
supply will range from two to five cents per 100 cubic feet.

   AIRCO GASES said a recent surcharge on industrial gas
products will affect about 150,000 customers. A figure
provided by the company on the number of customers was
incorrect in last Wednesday's edition.
