   NEW YORK -- Bargain-hunting and a decline in oil prices
helped the stock market stage its first gain in four days,
despite further evidence of a weakening U.S. economy.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 32.67, or 1.3%, to
2485.64, breaking a 118.32-point, 4.6% decline since last
Tuesday. Broader averages also bounced back: Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.67 to 308.26, a gain of 1.20%,
and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.69 to
169.20, up 1%.

   Volume at the Big Board was moderate at 155,940,000
shares. Advancing issues barely outpaced decliners, 770 to
745.
   Crude oil futures for November delivery slipped 72 cents,
to $37.53 a barrel.
   Also exciting the market was a report in this newspaper
yesterday that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan is
in talks with MCA Inc. regarding a possible acquisition for
$80 to $90 a share, or about $6.7 billion to $7.5 billion.
   MCA confirmed that it was talking to a "major
international company"; a Dow Jones News Service story later
said an anonymous "senior official at Matsushita Electric"
confirmed the talks of a possible buy-out.
   MCA's shares rocketed 19 1/2 to 54, with 3.7 million
shares trading, making it the most active Big Board issue and
the largest gainer on the exchange yesterday. Shares of other
entertainment companies jumped on the news: Paramount
Communications rose 3 1/4 to 34 7/8; Time Warner gained 1 1/4
to 70 7/8, and Walt Disney rose 1 5/8 to 90 1/8.
   Despite the gains, some traders and investors said they
thought the rebound would be short-lived.
   "This is a market with absolutely no conviction," said
Edward Shopkorn, general partner at Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. "The
economic numbers say we are going into a recession. Equities
are overvalued relative to the economic outlook around the
world." In the final revision of second-quarter gross
national product growth released yesterday, the government
said that the economy crawled ahead at a 0.4% annual rate,
compared with the previous estimate of 1.2%. Mr. Shopkorn
said the market's bounce was mainly due to professionals
buying back positions they had sold "short" earlier, and to
money managers "nibbling" at stocks.
   Money managers are also keeping a close eye on Federal
Reserve policy and budget negotiations. Graham Tanaka,
president of Tanaka Capital Management, a growth stock
manager, said recent reports that asserted the Federal
Reserve wouldn't immediately ease interest rates helped
growth stocks, which were among the most active issues
yesterday. PepsiCo rebounded 3/8 to 22 on 1.7 million shares,
for example.
   Mr. Tanaka said the Fed's inflation-fighting stance is a
positive for growth stocks because future earnings appear
protected from escalating inflation. Still, Mr. Tanaka said,
the stock market is vulnerable to a weak budget accord that
doesn't seriously control federal spending.
   "We are sweating it out because of our concerns that
Congress is dropping the ball on fiscal policy," said Mr.
Tanaka.
   Major oil companies sat out yesterday's rally.
   Mobil fell 1 to 65 7/8 and Sun Co. was off 1/2 to 32.
Phillips Petroleum stumbled 7/8 to 28. Amoco declined 1/2 to
58. Unocal lost 1/4 to 33 1/4 and Atlantic Richfield dropped
1 1/8 to 138 7/8. Only Exxon avoided the decline, finishing
unchanged at 50 1/2.
   Battered recently by the anticipated effects of higher oil
prices, major airline issues finished with gains. AMR climbed
1 3/4 to 41 3/4. Delta rose 1 1/4 to 54 1/8 and USAir Group
was 1 3/8 higher at 16 1/2. The Associated Press reported
that analysts expect higher oil prices to knock weaker
airlines out of the sky.
   UAL was the exception among airline stocks, dropping 3 1/4
to 89 amid more concerns about an employee buy-out effort.
   Chase Manhattan regained some of the ground it lost in the
wake of last week's dividend cut and cutback announcement.
Its shares closed 7/8 higher at 12.
   Other major international banks also finished higher.
Citicorp was up 1/4 to 15 1/2, Bankers Trust added 1/2 to 32
3/4 and Manufacturers Hanover gained 1/2 to 22 3/8.
   BankAmerica said it will join forces with Barclays Bank to
battle American Express for traveler's check supremacy.
BankAmerica closed 7/8 higher at 20 1/2. American Express
shares added 1 to close at 21 3/4.
   Mid-September car sale figures were released yesterday and
the market gave them mixed reviews. General Motors rose 3/8
to 36 1/2. Ford also gained, closing 1/4 higher to 33 1/8,
while Chrysler dropped 1/4 to 10 1/8. Both Shearson Lehman
Brothers and Goldman Sachs reiterated negative ratings on
Chrysler.
   American Brands announced a 2-for-1 stock split and a
boost in its quarterly dividend to 38.5 cents a share. The
new dividend rate is equivalent to 77 cents a share before
the split, when the rate was 68 cents. American Brands gained
1 3/4 to 68.
   Crane said it is considering spinning off its defense
businesses to shareholders. At $77.6 million, the defense
businesses represented about 5% of Crane's fiscal 1989 sales.
Crane was 1/2 higher at 19 1/4.
   Brush Wellman projected third-quarter earnings will be
significantly below the 22 cents a share it reported in the
quarter a year ago. Its shares fell 2 to 13 1/2.
   Reebok International said lower U.S. footwear sales will
depress third-quarter earnings. Reebok projected
third-quarter earnings at between 33 cents and 35 cents a
share, down from 44 cents a share a year ago. It sees
fourth-quarter earnings rising to the 30 cents a share it
earned in the fourth quarter last year. Reebok shares dropped
3/4 to 9 1/8.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.33
to 313.17. Volume totaled 12,940,000 shares.
