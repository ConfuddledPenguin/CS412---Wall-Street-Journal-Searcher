   UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. -- Western Union Corp., a
financial services and communications company, said it
extended to Oct. 9 its offer to swap new notes and common
shares for two issues of senior notes.
   The exchange offer, which is an integral part of Western
Union's recapitalization plan, had been scheduled to expire
last Monday, when note holders had tendered $348.1 million of
the $500 million of 19.25% notes outstanding and $1.4 million
of the $30 million of 16% notes outstanding.
