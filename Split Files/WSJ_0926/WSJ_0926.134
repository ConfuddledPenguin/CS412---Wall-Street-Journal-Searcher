   Stride Rite's Keds division posted a 24% sales increase in
the quarter, partly because of increased shipments of women's
and children's leather products, which supplemented the
growth of Keds basic canvas products, the company said.
   Third-quarter sales at Stride Rite's Children's Group rose
5% from last year's quarter, while Sperry Top-Sider sales
posted a 7% increase.
   For the nine months, Stride Rite's net income rose 21% to
$46.1 million, or $1.74 a share, while sales rose 14% to
$414.8 million.
