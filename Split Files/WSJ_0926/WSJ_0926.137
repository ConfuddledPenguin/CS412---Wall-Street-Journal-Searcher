   GREENWICH, Conn. -- United Parcel Service of America Inc.
and Yamato Transport Co. of Japan, eager for a bigger share
of the booming air cargo trade between the U.S. and Japan,
have formed a joint venture.
   Closely held UPS, the world's largest package delivery
company, and Yamato, Japan's largest, named the venture
Unistar Air Cargo. A UPS official confirmed that the new
venture would be capitalized at more than one billion yen ($7
million), but wouldn't disclose the exact figures.

   UPS and Yamato have been cooperating on small package
delivery services since 1986, and UPS officials said the new
venture expands current ties. Unistar allows the two
companies to provide door-to-door package service from
anywhere in the two countries. Analysts called the combinaton
logical, as UPS gears up to start direct air cargo flights to
Japan sometime after October. "UPS continues to chip away, to
expand a little bit at a time," says David M. Guthrie, an
analyst at Morgan Keegan in Memphis. "They should be a strong
competitor."
   Unistar will have its U.S. headquarters in Chicago, with
branches in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Anchorage, Alaska. In Japan, its operations will be based in
Tokyo. Officials said they plan to add 15 American branches
in early 1991.
   Analysts said since UPS's ties with Yamato are widely
known in the industry, it would not substantially alter the
existing competitve mix. Nonetheless, the intensely
competitive international air cargo market, which generates
$8 billion a year, is not expected to cool down anytime soon.
And Japan is the fastest-growing area.
   Currently, Federal Express Corp. is the only all-cargo
carrier offering scheduled services to Japan. But UPS, which
won the right to fly five times a week to Tokyo through
negotiations between the U.S. and Japanese governments last
November, will start competing soon with Federal Express for
air freight forwarding business.
   And in May, Japan Air Lines, West Germany's Lufthansa
airline and the Japanese trading company, Nissho Iwai Corp,
joined the fray when they bought a stake in DHL Worldwide
Express.
   UPS, which had revenue of more than $12 billion in 1989,
delivered more than 2.8 billion packages and documents in all
50 U.S. states and in more than 180 countries. Yamato, one of
Japan's oldest transportation companies, had revenue of $2.4
billion in 1989.
