   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose against all major currencies
except the yen as dealers focused on reassurances by a Fed
governor about credit policy and new warnings from a Soviet
official about the Persian Gulf powder keg.
   Competitive interest rates attract foreign funds to the
U.S. And the dollar is still the first currency that
investors buy when seeking a haven from global instability,
though its place as a long-term safe harbor has been
tarnished by U.S. economic problems.

   The dollar fell against the yen in the New York afternoon,
but gained strength against the mark, when a senior German
finance ministry official said in Washington that he believes
the Japanese currency could appreciate further against its
German counterpart.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5725 marks, up from 1.5590 marks late Monday in New York.
The U.S. currency dropped to 136.72 yen, however, from 137.35
yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was quoted late in the
day at $1.8680, down from $1.8810 late Monday.
   In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 136.70
yen, unchanged from the close there Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5735
marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5553 marks.
   On Tuesday, the dollar had started lower in a belated
reaction to the Saturday meeting in Washington of the Group
of Seven industrialized countries. The finance ministers and
central bankers registered their approval of the recent
depreciation of the dollar with direct reference to the yen.
   The mark, which had closed in New York the previous day at
88.17 yen, was slowly losing ground to the Japanese unit and
stood at 87.75 yen before the comment by the German official
was reported. Within 10 minutes, it shed an entire yen before
rising slightly to finish at 86.94 yen.
   As a conduit for cross, or non-dollar, transactions, the
greenback falls against the purchased currency and rises
against the sold counterpart.
   Of more direct benefit to the dollar was a speech before
the United Nations by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze. He denounced Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
warned that "war may break out in the Gulf region any day,
any moment."
   The U.N. Security Council scheduled a full meeting for
late yesterday, possibly to discuss expanding its land and
sea embargo of Iraq to include air transport.
   The U.S. reported a sharp increase in the number of Iraqi
troops and tanks in southern Kuwait, as Baghdad set Oct. 15
for a "trial" of President Bush for "crimes against the
people of the world."
   Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell reaffirmed the
central bank's commitment to price stability in the face of
rising oil prices. "Attempting, through an easing of policy,
to somehow avoid or postpone the implied real adjustments of
the oil shock would only serve to undermine the credibility
of policy and lead to potentially more severe adjustments
over the longer run," he said.
   Echoing comments by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Mr.
Angell emphasized the importance of long-term interest rates
over short-term rates. High long-term rates threaten the
recovery of the U.S.'s weak real estate industry.
   Only a "credible commitment to price stability," meaning
holding Fed-influenced short-term rates high, will "bring
about a moderation in long-term interest rates," Mr. Angell
said in the Washington speech.
   Mr. Angell suggested the Fed would wait for the market's
reaction to a federal budget accord before easing credit.
Bond traders are expected to see a diminished flow of
Treasury issues resulting from a reduced U.S. budget deficit
and to bid them higher, lowering their yield.
   "Should a budget agreement lead to lower market rates, the
Federal Reserve would likely not want to curtail such
declines. In the face of falling interest rates, it wouldn't
be desirable for the Federal Reserve to hold up the short end
of the market," Mr. Angell said.
   Alfonso Alejo, a corporate foreign exchange dealer in New
York with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, called Mr. Angell's speech
a "big comment" that "put a bid under the dollar."
   The prospect of interest rate cuts was further diminished
by disarray in Washington. With budget talks still at an
impasse over President Bush's proposal to cut capital gains
taxes, a bill to delay the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts due
Monday was cleared for a vote on the floor of the House. Mr.
Bush repeated his intention to veto the bill.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $402.40 an ounce, down 60 cents.
Estimated volume was a heavy 6.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $401.50 an ounce.
