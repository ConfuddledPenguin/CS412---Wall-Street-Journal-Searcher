   The United Nations Security Council extended the land and
sea embargo of Iraq to the air, and the Soviet foreign
minister warned Baghdad that it could face military action
unless it withdraws from Kuwait.
   The council, with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze in the chair, voted 14-1 to impose an air
embargo against Moscow's former client state, with only Cuba
in opposition. It also said it would consider taking measures
against nations that violate the U.N. sanctions imposed
against Baghdad.

   The resolution pointedly noted that continued Iraqi
defiance of U.N. policy "could lead to further serious
action" by the Security Council. That appeared to be an echo
of a warning by Mr. Shevardnadze that the U.N. has the
authority to sponsor military action.
   But there were no signs Iraq was backing down. The
Pentagon released new figures showing further massive Iraqi
troop concentrations in and near Kuwait, and Turkish
President Turgut Ozal warned Mr. Bush that it may be
"difficult" to get Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to withdraw
his occupation forces from Kuwait.
   In a taped television message to the American people, the
Iraqi president said a war against Iraq would be bloodier
than the Vietnam conflict. He blamed the international
condemnation of Iraq on a "conspiracy" led by the U.S. to
punish him for supporting Palestinian Arabs. However, he also
said conflict could be avoided through dialogue with the U.S.
   Under the Security Council resolution, nations won't allow
any flights between their territory and Iraq or Kuwait.
Further, they won't allow flights over their territory unless
the involved aircraft land for inspections to ensure that
they aren't carrying embargoed items. The resolution exempts
the transport of food or medical supplies for humanitarian
purposes, but such cargoes could be sent only under strict
international supervision.
   The resolution doesn't spell out a specific penalty for
violators. But it does include a provision stating that the
council will consider measures against countries that violate
the embargo. It also calls on all nations to detain any ship
of Iraqi registry that enters their ports, if it is found to
violate the sanctions.
   Following the vote, Secretary of State James Baker told
the council that "the more effective the enforcement of
sanctions, the more likely the peaceful resolution of this
conflict."
   Earlier in the day, Mr. Shevardnadze warned Iraq that the
U.N. might exercise its right to "suppress acts of
aggression" militarily if the Iraqis don't withdraw from
Kuwait.
   "A great war may break out in the {Persian} Gulf region
any day, any moment," the Soviet official told the U.N.
General Assembly in a tough speech that also hinted that
Saddam Hussein should be tried for his recent acts, including
hostage-taking.
   The Defense Department said Iraq has massed 430,000
troops, 3,500 tanks, 2,500 armored personnel carriers and
around 1,700 artillery pieces in the large geographic region
the Pentagon defines as militarily near Kuwait. That is an
increase -- in just one week -- of 70,000 troops, 700 tanks,
700 personnel carriers and 200 artillery pieces.
   Mr. Shevardnadze seemed to emphasize the military option
in the crisis far more than President Mikhail Gorbachev has.
"We should remind those who regard aggression as an
acceptable form of behavior that the United Nations has the
power to suppress acts of aggression," he said, quoting from
the U.N. charter. "There is already ample evidence that this
right can be exercised. It will be, if the illegal occupation
of Kuwait continues. There is enough unity in this regard in
the Security Council, and there is also the will and a high
degree of consensus in the world community."
   Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, mixed dire warnings of massive
violence with conciliatory signals in his taped address to
the American people. The Iraqi leader asserted that President
Bush "pushes your children to a war that has no human value
whatsoever."
   In his 75-minute taped speech, delivered in response to an
eight-minute address by President Bush that recently was
aired on Iraqi TV, the Iraqi leader said, "Let us resort to
dialogue rather than arms."
   He reasserted his claim that Kuwait has long been a
legitimate part of Iraq and that his military move into
Kuwait was justified because Kuwait was waging economic war
against Baghdad by driving down oil prices. But he
embellished Iraq's justifications by charging that Kuwait's
actions against Iraq were part of a grander international
conspiracy, involving both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, to
cripple Iraq, largely because of its support for the
Palestinian cause.
   At the White House, President Bush rewarded Turkish
President Ozal for his support in the Gulf crisis by pledging
greater economic and military help. The new aid includes an
unspecified increase in Turkey's textile quotas to the U.S.,
more military assistance including F-16 fighter jets, a hefty
share of the international aid the U.S. has raised for
countries hurt by the crisis, and greater U.S. support for
Turkey's bid to join the European Community.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James Dobbins told
reporters that Mr. Ozal counseled the president that the
sanctions would begin to bite in two to four months, and that
the true strength of Iraq's military had been routinely
exaggerated in the West. However, Mr. Dobbins also quoted Mr.
Ozal as saying that "flexibility was not a strong point" with
Saddam Hussein and that it would be "difficult" to get him to
back down.
   The two presidents, Mr. Dobbins said, complained about the
recent increases in the price of oil and charged that prices
"were not being set by supply and demand, but by speculative
pressures." He said the leaders believed there was adequate
oil at a much lower price and that the high prices would harm
many economies.
   Mr. Dobbins said the two presidents didn't discuss the war
option in sessions attended by aides, but the two men held a
private meeting at which the subject may have arisen. If war
breaks out, the U.S. probably will count on Turkey to send
forces, or at least menace Iraq from the Turkish-Iraqi
border.
   In another diplomatic development, Syrian President Hafez
Assad ended a visit to Tehran by issuing a joint statement
with Iranian leaders condemning both the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and the presence of Western troops in the Persian
Gulf.
   Mr. Assad, who sides with the U.S. in the Gulf crisis,
said he had no differences on the matter with Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose government has been more
ambivalent. Syrian sources told Western news agencies that
Iran pledged to uphold the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq
but insisted that food could be shipped to Baghdad as a
"humanitarian" exception.
   American intelligence agencies say small amounts of food
from Iran have been slipping into Iraq, and they are worried
about several full Iraqi oil tankers, which they fear might
be heading for Iran to unload. The Bush administration had
hoped Mr. Assad could persuade Iran to avoid breaking the
embargo. Mr. Assad, Iran's only Arab ally, met with Secretary
of State James Baker 10 days ago.
   News agencies, citing Syrian sources, said Mr. Rafsanjani
told Mr. Assad that Iran wouldn't buy Iraqi oil, but that the
Syrian leader failed to win such guarantees on shipping food
to its old foe.
