   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. named its
best-known investment banker, J. Tomilson Hill, to be co-head
of its reconstituted Lehman Brothers division.
   The move continues nearly a year of management change at
Shearson, the American Express Co. securities unit that is
restructuring after being buffeted by financial problems.
Lehman Brothers has been resurrected as the new name for the
investment-banking and trading half of Shearson.

   The appointment of the 42-year-old Mr. Hill has symbolic
significance. It means that the co-chief executive officers
of Lehman Brothers -- Mr. Hill and Richard S. Fuld Jr., 44 --
both are veterans of the old Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.
investment bank that Shearson acquired in 1984. This might
help Shearson as it tries to play up the Lehman Brothers
mystique, though relatively few Lehman veterans remain at
Shearson.
   As Lehman's co-chief, Mr. Hill succeeds Sherman R. Lewis
Jr., 53. Mr. Lewis, a Shearson veteran, has been increasingly
taking on corporate duties at Shearson since the firm began
shaking up management in November 1989. Mr. Lewis will become
one of two Shearson vice chairmen, joining Ronald J. Yoo, and
continue to be a senior investment banker.
   People on Wall Street weren't surprised that Shearson
named Mr. Hill to the post; he has been Shearson's point man
in some of its biggest investment banking deals in recent
years -- including the $14 billion merger of Time Inc. and
Warner Communications Inc. last year, which garnered Shearson
$48.5 million in fees. As one of three co-heads of the
investment banking department, the helicopter-hopping Mr.
Hill has tried to maintain Shearson's contacts with corporate
chief executives, a difficult job considering Shearson's
internal turmoil over the past year.
   "The lion's share of my time will still be spent with
clients," Mr. Hill said in an interview.
   Mr. Fuld said that while it "wasn't part of the grand
plan" to have two Lehman veterans running the division, he
thinks it's "nice" that it worked out that way. Only five of
the 11 members of the Lehman Brothers management committee
are Lehman veterans. But Mr. Hill argues, "That speaks to the
diversity of the management team here, as we've been
re-introducing the Lehman Brothers concept."
   In addition to their co-chief executive titles, Mr. Hill
will be vice chairman of Lehman Brothers, while Mr. Fuld
remains president of the division.
   The 140-year-old Lehman Brothers name still carries cachet
on Wall Street, especially among older bankers who remember
the House of Lehman and its reputation for investment-banking
prowess. Shearson's new management sent down from American
Express has hoped that the new name would bolster morale.
   Such boosts are needed these days as the pace of the
mergers and acquisitions business all around Wall Street has
dropped to seven-year lows, according to Securities Data Co.
The Lehman division is said to be profitable so far this year
-- relying more on stock and bond trading profits, and areas
of investment banking other than mergers -- but officials
wouldn't comment on that.
   When the "new" Lehman was recreated, the thought was to
"create an identity that is very clear in the marketplace,"
said Mr. Hill. "And despite the markets' being in a state of
disarray and some of the internal issues we've been
confronting, the fact we've been able to do as much business
as we have is really a tribute to the strategy."
   Added Mr. Fuld: "I think it has clearly given our people a
sense of identity. I think they've rallied around the name."
   The Lehman division includes 6,500 of Shearson's nearly
33,500 employees. Shearson remains the nation's
second-biggest brokerage firm behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., but
Shearson has slashed its payroll 6%, or 2,100 positions, this
year.
   Howard L. Clark Jr., Shearson's chairman, said Mr. Hill
was "at the forefront" of a firm-wide business review that
led to decisions earlier this year to pull out of various
nonessential businesses and close 67 of its U.S. branch
offices, leaving 450.
   A Harvard graduate who started his career at First Boston
Corp., Mr. Hill moved on to head Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.'s mergers department. He joined the old Lehman Brothers
firm in 1982 as a managing director in its mergers
department. He has known Mr. Fuld, his new co-head, for about
a decade.
   Shearson said that Michael Madden and Mel Shaftel,
managing directors, will continue as co-heads of investment
banking. They had been sharing those duties with Mr. Hill.
James Stern remains head of merchant banking. Meanwhile,
Lehman veteran Frederick Frank, a 58-year-old senior managing
director, was named chairman of the investment banking
group's executive committee.
   Mr. Lewis, in a statement, said giving up his Lehman
Brothers position and becoming a Shearson vice chairman "is
the culmination of a process begun last November, when I
stepped back from day-to-day management of investment
banking."
   Messrs. Lewis, Hill, Fuld and Yoo all were elected to the
19-member Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. board
yesterday, along with Jonathan S. Linen, head of the Shearson
Lehman Brothers division. That division, the other half of
Shearson, includes the firm's more than 9,000 brokers and its
money-management operations.
