   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury plans to raise $1.45 billion in
new cash with the sale Monday of about $18.4 billion in
short-term bills to redeem $16.96 billion in maturing bills.
   However, the Treasury will postpone the auction unless it
has assurances that the debt ceiling will be raised.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and
26-week bills maturing on Jan. 3, 1991, and April 4, 1991,
respectively. The bills will be available in minimum
denominations of $10,000.
   Tenders must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the
Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.
