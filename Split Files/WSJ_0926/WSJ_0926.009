   TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s interest in
buying MCA Inc., parent of Universal Studios, raises the
stakes as Japanese electronics companies scramble to get into
the entertainment industry.
   In particular, the talks intensify Matsushita's rivalry
with Sony Corp., which last year purchased Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. for $5 billion.

   Matsushita officials confirmed yesterday that they are
talking to MCA, based in Universal City, Calif., but said no
decisions have been made. "There have been various talks of
this nature regarding mergers and acquisitions, but nothing
has materialized as of today," a Matsushita spokesman said.
But he added that movies, television programming, books,
records and other forms of so-called entertainment software
make up "a field that will be increasingly important in the
future."
   The disclosure comes at a time when Japanese companies
once again have begun making news with high-profile direct
investments in the U.S. Eyebrows were raised in some quarters
this month about Minoru Isutani, a Japanese golf course
developer, being behind the acquisition of the famous Pebble
Beach golf resort in California for an estimated $800 million
to $1 billion.
   After Sony's acquisition of Columbia and Mitsubishi Estate
Co.'s purchase of a 51% stake in Rockefeller Center in New
York City touched off a public outcry in the U.S., Japanese
companies appeared to steer away from such so-called trophy
purchases. Some Japanese officials and pundits warned of a
serious political backlash in the U.S. if Japanese companies
continued to buy culturally prized American properties.
   Though Matsushita has been rumored previously to be
shopping around for a studio, its interest in MCA may be a
signal of change in the company, analysts said. Some analysts
have been concerned that the company has been struggling for
direction since the death last year of Konosuke Matsushita,
its legendary founder.
   Sony's success in selling compact disk players, after the
acquisition of CBS Records, has made it clear that a
company's ability to produce its own entertainment software,
the music in this case, can help push sales of companion
hardware.
   "If they Matsushita don't get into software, they will
be at the end of their rope very soon," Boris Petersik, an
analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan), said.
   Matsushita's traditional strategy has been to watch for
Sony innovations, then rush out similar products within
months at lower prices. But this strategy appears to have
become more difficult recently. After Sony launched a
"passport sized" video camcorder in June last year, it took
other makers, including Matsushita, a year to come up with
competitive products.
   Matsushita's camcorder, which is slightly bigger than
Sony's, adds a so-called fuzzy-logic computer chip that
minimizes shaking in the recorded image. But before
Matsushita's product went on sale, Sony had sold more than
one million camcorders, grabbing a 30% share of the world
camcorder market and 60% of the Japanese market, according to
Sony.
   Now, instead of following other makers, Matsushita is
striving to become a leading marketer of high-definition
television, the next major advance in audio-visual equipment,
expected to go on sale next year. Industry observers estimate
the high-quality television sets could create a 14.5 trillion
yen ($105.6 billion) market in the next 10 years.
   "They're not going to get left behind," Barry Dargan, an
analyst with James Capel Securities Ltd., said. "What they
want to do is become an innovator." And having access to
entertainment software would support sales of Matsushita's
equipment, he said.
   Other Japanese electronics companies also have been eager
to acquire their own library of software. Pioneer Electronic
Corp.'s subsidiary in May purchased a 10% stake in Los
Angeles-based Carolco Pictures Inc. for $60 million. Pioneer
hopes to market Carolco's films, including "Rambo" and
"Terminator," for its laser disk machines. Other electronics
makers, such as Sanyo Electric Co. and Sharp Corp., said they
don't have specific plans, but they emphasize the important
role of software.
   Even companies outside the industry have ventured into the
U.S. entertainment sector, though on a much smaller scale.
Trading houses, such as Sumitomo Corp. and Marubeni Corp.,
and leasing companies, such as Orix Corp., have invested in
Hollywood movies, hoping to cash in on the growing
videocassette and cable-television market in Japan.
   A deal with MCA would heighten Matsushita's efforts to
promote an international corporate image. Answering U.S.
criticism that Japanese companies weren't importing enough
products, Matsushita earlier this year opened a 60-store
shopping mall packed with clothes, stationery and food
imported from the U.S. and Europe. The company expects to
post sales of six billion yen from the stores in the first
year.
   Matsushita's 51%-owned Victor Co. of Japan unit last year
formed a joint venture with the Hollywood producer Lawrence
Gordon, and the U.S. venture plans to release its first film,
"Point Break," early next year.
