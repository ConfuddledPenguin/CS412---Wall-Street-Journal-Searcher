   CHICAGO -- Bitter rivalry between the two big futures
exchanges here will work against the latest attempts to
develop joint operations.
   The Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange
are embracing a plan to cut costs and work together to boost
their international businesses. The exchanges said last week
that they are exploring sharing trading floors and
trade-processing facilities -- ventures that eventually could
lead to complete union.

   At the same time, the exchanges are locked in a costly
marketing duel with competing new products designed to tap
investor interest in the Japanese stock and bond markets. The
Merc kicked off the new product battle yesterday with new
futures and options contracts based on the widely quoted
Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks. The Board of Trade
weighs in tomorrow with futures contracts based on a broader
index of Japanese stocks and Japanese government bonds.
   "It makes so much sense for us to get together, but here
we are fighting it out again," says Patrick Arbor, a Board of
Trade director.
   The Board of Trade, desperately needing to enlarge the
area for its Treasury bond and other financial futures,
initiated the latest peace talks between the exchanges. The
financial trading room at the exchange is antiquated by
modern trading standards, and Board of Trade chairman William
O'Connor estimates an up-to-date one may cost $100 million.
   The Merc has a different space problem: It has too much.
An entire trading floor sits empty one level above the Merc's
existing trading quarters. In rosier times the exchange had
planned to move all of its stock-index related products to
the new floor. But trading volume in stock-index futures
never recovered from the 1987 stock market crash.
   Mr. O'Connor favors the use of the Merc's empty floor to
trade T-bond futures, among other contracts.
   Futures brokerage and trading firms that use both
exchanges are increasingly urging them to work together and
lower the cost of futures trading. Most of the Merc's member
firms also belong to the Board of Trade, paying clearing and
other fees at both exchanges that could be sharply reduced if
the two combined certain functions.
   Cost control is playing an increasing role in exchange
affairs. This year the Board of Trade, rather than spending
millions in development costs, agreed to combine its planned
electronic trading system into the Merc's Globex computerized
trading system. The exchanges also are sharing the cost of
developing a hand-held terminal to be used by brokers in the
futures pits.
   But exchange politics, as much as dollars and common
sense, are motivating the latest peace talks at the
exchanges, say Board of Trade and Merc members. Mr. O'Connor
and Mr. Arbor are expected to vie for Board of Trade chairman
in December. Mr. Arbor, a former exchange vice chairman, has
made no secret of his plans to advocate an outright merger of
the two markets. Mr. O'Connor's supporters urged him to
advocate talks with the Merc to counter the impact of similar
proposals from Mr. Arbor, members of both exchanges say.
   Mr. O'Connor is vacationing in Ireland and couldn't be
reached for comment. Mr. Arbor said he hasn't made a final
decision on whether to run for chairman, but he said that Mr.
O'Connor's overtures to the Merc don't go far enough.
   Institutional pride may work to keep the exchanges apart.
The independent traders on the Board of Trade floor don't
want to appear to be losers in any deal, forced to walk
several blocks to trade on the Merc's floor. Merc traders
aren't above putting appearances first, either. A decade ago,
when both exchanges were in need of additional space and
having similar talks, Merc traders reportedly rejected a
Board of Trade suggestion that they build a facility just
south of that exchange's building. They didn't want to be
seen as trading "behind" the Board of Trade, members of both
exchanges say.
   For such reasons, many traders think any formal links of
the Merc and the Board of Trade are years away, despite the
recent warming. "We won't see a merger in my lifetime,"
predicts the chief executive officer of a Merc member firm,
who is in his 40s.
   With its new contract, the Merc aims to attract U.S.
hedgers and speculators, and to ease trade processing, by
having the contract settle in dollars rather than Japanese
yen. As a result, there is essentially no risk that
short-term currency price swings will affect the value of the
futures contract.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a
specific amount of a commodity or financial instrument at an
agreed-to price by a certain date.
   Tomorrow night, the Board of Trade starts trading its
futures and options contracts on the Topix index of about
1,200 Japanese stocks. The exchange will launch the new
contract during its 7 p.m. to 9:15 p.m. CDT evening session,
which coincides with the morning trading session on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. After the evening launch, the contract will
also trade during the exchange's regular hours for
stock-index products, 8:15 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. CDT.
   The broader Topix index is aimed particularly at
institutional investors who want to hedge against potential
losses on their Japanese stock holdings. It is settled in
yen, not dollars.
   Many Chicago traders predict that the Merc's Nikkei
contract, rather than the Board of Trade's Topix index, will
generate the most interest from local independent traders who
operate on exchange floors here. The volume of trading these
"locals" can handle should attract hedging orders from big
institutional traders in the U.S. and Tokyo, these traders
predict.
   "To attract the Japanese, we've got to make sure that
there are warm bodies in the pit," says Matthew Moran,
director of the Merc's equity-index product marketing
department. "If there are, the institutional investors will
come, too." In its first day of trading, the Nikkei volume
totaled 915 futures contracts and 532 options.
   However, while the Merc enjoys greater name recognition
for its Japanese stock-index product, the Board of Trade's
offering of a night trading session for its Topix future may
give it an edge, some believe.
   "Certainly Tokyo's participants will look favorably on
arbitrage opportunities created by night trading," which
would overlap trading hours of Japanese stocks, says Nobuaki
Ohmura, executive vice president of fixed-income investments
for Daiwa America Inc., the U.S. unit of one of Japan's four
biggest securities firms.
   The Topix debut may be overshadowed by the Board of
Trade's introduction tomorrow night of futures and options on
Japanese government bonds. The exchange hopes trading in
these contracts will benefit from its huge success in trading
U.S. Treasury bond futures and options. The Board of Trade's
T-bond futures contract is the most actively traded futures
contract in the country.
   Arbitrage opportunities during the night trading session
also are likely to give trading in Japanese government bonds
a boost, says Joseph Cole, research director for Indosuez
Carr Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   Despite the money and time spent on them, success isn't
guaranteed for any of the new contracts. Their long-term
success hinges largely on the participation of Japan's huge
financial institutions, and they traditionally move slowly to
new products. They may also hold back because of the poor
performance of many Japanese brokerage firms' Wall Street
units in the 1980s.
   Further, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and skyrocketing
crude-oil prices are likely to put on hold expansion plans at
many Japanese institutions. Falling stock prices in Japan,
coupled with rising interest rates there, could also reduce
the desire of Japanese investors to make substantial
commitments to foreign markets for the foreseeable future.
   Looking ahead, the Japanese are likely to be concerned
about protecting their own futures markets, which are recent
outgrowths of the still-evolving easing of that country's
capital markets. For example, an affiliate of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange has been trading Japanese government bond futures
for five years. Stock-index futures contracts are also
actively traded on exchanges in Tokyo and Osaka.
   While the Chicago exchanges whittle away at each other as
they compete for business to support the new contracts,
Japanese finance officials may encourage institutions to keep
their money at home to promote domestic markets.
