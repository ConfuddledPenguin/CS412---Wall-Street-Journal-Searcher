   NEW YORK -- Encouraged by lower oil prices, investors
pushed U.S. government long-term bond prices higher
yesterday.
   Treasury bonds pulled out of their recent tailspin,
climbing about 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount.
As of late in the afternoon, the yield on the government's
benchmark 30-year bonds was 9.13%, down from 9.17% late
Monday.

   But corporate junk bonds didn't join in the rally. Prices
slumped again yesterday, partly reflecting growing fears that
the economy's weakness will trigger a big wave of defaults in
coming years on junk bonds, those high-yield, high-risk
issues that have low credit ratings or no rating at all.
   "The excesses of the junk bond market in the late 1980s
are now coming home to roost," said Richard Lehmann,
president of the Bond Investors Association of Miami Lakes,
Fla. Speaking at a conference in New York, Mr. Lehmann
predicted sharp increases in junk-bond defaults this year and
next. "We're basing this on a forecast of only a modest
recession," he added.
   Investors also remain concerned about some big banks'
securities. Traders say investors fear that Chase Manhattan
Corp.'s recent decision to cut its dividend as well as its
work force could be an early-warning signal of problems at
other large banks. Prices of both Chase and Citicorp bonds
fell yesterday.
   Despite yesterday's Treasury bond market rally, many
individual investors, worried by inflation fears and Middle
East tensions, are shunning long-term bonds and buying
shorter-term issues instead. That strategy is smart, numerous
investment managers say. They are especially bullish on
Treasury issues due in five years or less, and many recommend
the new two-year notes auctioned yesterday by the government
at an average annual yield of 8.18%.
   Buying short-term notes "makes a lot of sense, given all
the uncertainty in the Gulf and the eventual implications for
inflation because of what's happening to oil prices," said
Edward Treichel, investment strategist at Van Kampen Merritt
Investment Advisory Corp.
   Mr. Treichel contended that the two-year notes sold
yesterday, as well as new four-year notes to be sold today,
"clearly represent attractive alternatives for conservative
investors." The four-year notes today are expected to yield
about 8 1/2%.
   Bruce Whiteford, a vice president at Chase Manhattan's
U.S. private banking division, agreed that the two-year notes
look very attractive. "At confused times like this, people
don't like to take chances, and buying a two-year Treasury
note doesn't entail any credit risk and very little price
volatility," he said. The price of a two-year Treasury note
typically fluctuates "considerably less" in the secondary, or
resale, markets than prices of long-term bonds, he said.
   "This is a good way to get a high yield without trying to
guess where the market is going," Mr. Whiteford said. Also,
"it keeps your powder dry."
   However, buying short-term issues also means accepting
lower yields than are available on long-term bonds. For
example, 30-year Treasury bonds now yield about 9 1/8%, or
around one percentage point more than the two-year notes.
Several investment managers think long-term bonds offer
attractive values, especially because of mounting evidence
that the U.S. economy is weakening and because they think
inflation fears are greatly exaggerated.
   Even though the economy hardly grew at all in this year's
second quarter, the Federal Reserve shouldn't lower interest
rates now, said Fed board member Wayne Angell. He contended
yesterday that the Fed's "anti-inflationary resolve is being
tested," and thus that the central bank shouldn't ease
credit.
   Even if the Fed were to ease, "the average fellow
shouldn't rush out and buy long bonds" now, said James
Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management Group, based in
Mountain View, Calif. He and several other money managers
said it isn't at all clear that a credit-easing move would
lead to higher bond prices because investors might interpret
such a move as a sign that the Fed had abandoned its
anti-inflation stance.
   Instead, investors should stick to notes due in about two
years to five years, Mr. Benham said. The two-year Treasury
notes sold yesterday represent "a good buy," he said. "You
enjoy a yield above 8%, you get your money back in two years,
and you don't subject yourself to the volatility invovlved
with long-term securities," he said.

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices advanced yesterday.
   The Treasury's benchmark bonds, the 8 3/4 issue due in
August of 2020, rose nearly 1/2 point to a price of 96 3/32.
Their yield fell to 9.13% from Monday's close of 9.17%, which
was the highest on a comparable issue in at least a year and
a half.
   Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly. For example,
the latest three-month bills were quoted late in the day at a
discount rate of 7.37% and a bond-equivalent yield of 7.59%.
The bills were sold Monday at an average discount rate of
7.32% and a bond-equivalent yield of 7.56%.
   The Treasury's two-year note auction yesterday "went very
well overall," said James Capra, executive vice president at
Lehman Government Securities Inc. "Institutional buying was
very strong, and there was also good-sized buying by
individual" investors.
   The Treasury said yesterday that it received $2.06 billion
of "noncompetitive" bids for the new two-year notes. That is
a special bidding process typically used mainly by individual
investors and small institutions. But this time, the total
also included about $810 million of notes "awarded to Federal
Reserve banks as agents for foreign and international
monetary authorities," a Treasury spokesman said.
   Thus, about $1.25 billion of noncompetitive bids came from
the public, the Treasury said. That was down slightly from
about $1.37 billion in the August auction. Nonetheless, Mr.
Capra said this month's total "still is a large amount and
shows the desire for individuals to use short-term Treasurys
as a safe haven."
   Today, the Treasury will sell new four-year notes. Late
yesterday, the issue was trading in the when-issued market at
a yield of about 8.53%.
   Here are details of the Treasury's sale of two-year notes
yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
                                                                                                       

                      Two-Year Notes

   The notes are dated Oct. 1, 1990 and mature Sept. 30,
1992.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate &amp; Junk Bonds

   Despite a late-afternoon rally, junk-bond prices finished
lower yesterday.
   Prices of bellwether corporate junk bonds ended the day
1/2 point lower.
   But prices rose on RJR Nabisco Inc.'s pay-in-kind bonds.
RJR's 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in
2009, finished 3/4 point higher at 110 3/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Traders attributed the climb in the RJR issues to firmer
stock prices and a ruling in a case against American Tobacco,
a unit of American Brands Inc. In that closely watched case,
jurors found in favor of the plaintiff but didn't award any
damages. Although RJR wasn't named as a defendant in the
case, traders cited the ruling as another important victory
for the tobacco industry.
   Meanwhile, in the investment-grade corporate debt market,
high-grade bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point higher.
However, prices of bonds of two large banks, Citicorp and
Chase Manhattan Corp., continued to fall on worries that
recent problems at Chase could mean weakness for other big
banks. Chase Manhattan's 9.75% subordinated notes, maturing
in 1999, dropped one point to 72 1/2 for yield of 14.50%,
traders said.
   Citicorp's 9.75% subordinated capital notes, due in 1999,
fell 1/2 point to 89 1/4 for a yield of 11.75%. Also losing
ground were Citicorp issues with shorter maturities.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bond investors were pulled from the sidelines by
yields exceeding 8%, providing a warm market reception for an
issue of $250 million Washington Public Power Supply System's
Nuclear Project No. 1 revenue refunding bonds.
   The issue, priced by a Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. group, yields
from 6.60% in 1992 to 8.04% in 2017.
   The tax-exempt bonds ended unchanged to about 3/8 point
higher in moderately active trading.
   Also brought to market, through competitive bidding, was
$120 million of Clark County, Nev., school improvement
limited tax revenue bonds, via a group led by First Boston
Corp., Lehman Brothers and Prudential-Bache Capital Funding.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue due 2018 was unchanged at 95 3/4 to
yield 7.55%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities were unchanged to
marginally lower, underperforming their Treasury
counterparts, in trading again dictated primarily by the
gyrations of oil prices.
   In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association's 9 1/2% securities for October delivery fell
2/32 to 97 19/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2%
gold participation certificates fell 1/32 to 98 1/8 and
Federal National Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% securities fell 1/32
to 97 30/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Inflation fears drove Japanese government bond yields
higher.
   But trading activity was light, and dealers said prices
hovered in a narrow band most of the day. The yield on
Japan's benchmark bonds due 1999 rose to 8.675%, up .065
percentage point, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   In London, prices of U.K. bonds were little changed to
slightly lower in what dealers described as very quiet
trading. Britain's 12% bonds due 1995 declined 1/8 point to
99 24/32 to yield 12.04%. The 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007
dipped 1/32 point, also to 99 24/32, to yield 11.77%.
   French Treasury bond prices rose following Monday's large
setback. France's 8 1/2% issue due 2000 rose 0.41 to 87.31 to
yield 10.68%.
