   NEW YORK -- When stocks of the Big Three auto makers are
yielding just about as much as long-term government bonds,
the market is saying something.
   If you believe your broker at Montgomery Securities,
Kidder Peabody or a host of other firms, the message is that
-- with the possible exception of Chrysler -- there is
scarcely a better use for your life savings than to invest
them in auto stocks.

   Ronald Glantz, auto analyst at Montgomery Securities,
says, "I call Ford and GM attractive entirely on the basis of
yield," the ratio of the dividend to the stock's market
price. General Motors stock is yielding 8.2%; Ford Motor,
9.1%, and Chrysler, 11.9%. These sound more like bond yields,
and, in fact, the yield on Ford's stock is within one
percentage point of the yield on its senior bonds.
   But as investors in Chase Manhattan stock learned last
week, a hefty yield isn't a guarantee of payment. And with
auto companies, too, one must ask whether dividends will
continue to be paid, or cut, as Chase's was. And to this
question, the market has an answer.
   "The market is telling you that the Big Three are likely
to trim dividends," Joseph Phillippi, a Shearson analyst,
says. In other words, if investors believed that dividends
were secure, they would pay more for the companies' stocks,
thus lowering yields.
   Most analysts still seem cautiously bullish that dividends
won't be cut. Yet PaineWebber, with no encouragement from the
auto makers but with its eye firmly on the looming recession,
already has published "estimates" of dividend cuts by the Big
Three in 1991.
   Thus, the prospect of recession has brought auto investors
to the same impasse faced by owners of high-yielding bank
stocks.
   Though the auto makers don't seem to be even contemplating
a cut -- Chairman Lee Iacocca has said Chrysler's payout will
be maintained, short of "nuclear war" -- investors are
increasingly worried.
   Markets aren't perfect, but on this point they have been
pretty good. According to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, whenever the
yield on auto stocks has been a bit more than twice the yield
of the S&amp;P 500 stock index, as it is now, the auto companies
have, soon after, cut their dividends.
   And if anyone has been punished of late, it has been those
who have reached for yield. High-yield junk bonds proved that
a high coupon does an investor little good when one's
principal is eroding. More recently, bank stocks, touted on
the basis of their attractive dividends, have been a
disaster.
   Auto companies, of course, haven't lent their capital to
Latin America or to real estate developers in New England.
The companies are safer than banks. Ford and GM are rated
double-A-minus, far above the below-investment-grade junk
bonds. Why then, all the worry?
   Two reasons. Many or most economists say a recession is
under way or about to be. And in virtually every postwar
recession, including the slumps in the mid-1970s and the
early 1980s, auto makers eliminated or reduced their payouts.
   Montgomery Securities' Mr. Glantz believes that the
dividends are sacrosanct, that "GM and Ford genuinely believe
that widows and orphans live off their dividend." One could
have had the same belief in 1982, when Ford and Chrysler both
eliminated their dividends.
   To invest now, one needs faith that auto makers will
weather this downturn better than they did the last one. And
if one is investing for yield, the key question is this: Will
the auto makers continue to earn as much as they are paying
out in dividends?
   Many analysts say Chrysler may not even be close to
earning its annual dividend of $1.20 a share next year. Ford
and GM, both paying $3 a share annually, should both earn
their dividends this year. But there are doubts about next
year.
   UBS's Jean-Claude Gruet, who is bullish on both GM and
Ford, predicts that GM will earn $3 a share next year and
Ford $3.70. In other words, GM would cover its dividend with
no margin for error, and Ford with only a slight margin.
   But Mr. Gruet's forecasts are based on the assumption that
the U.S. endures only a mild recession of six to nine months.
"If you have a severe recession," he says, "earnings go below
that."
   PaineWebber, which is bearish, sees GM earning $1.80 a
share and Ford $3.40 in a mild downturn in 1991. In a harsh
recession -- one lasting all of next year -- PaineWebber sees
GM in the red and Ford earning a scant $1.35 a share.
   Bulls make the point that companies may continue to pay
dividends even when they aren't "covered" by earnings. Ford
and GM could both borrow to pay dividends if earnings fell
short, and both might well do so for a year or even two. But
to count on that is speculative.
   According to a recent PaineWebber report, "Auto companies
cut the dividend not because of inadequate cash or other
financial necessity, but because of a combination of fear and
prudence."
   In a recession of more than six months, the report says,
dividend cuts would "appear likely . . ., even though cash
balances should be adequate to support both capital spending
and dividends."
   Depending on the level of car and light-truck sales for
the rest of the year, unit sales in the U.S. will have fallen
10% to 15% from 1986. In the early '80s industry collapse,
they fell about one-third.
   Were such a slide to be repeated, profit margins most
likely would fall even further. "When things get bad, cash
can run off at alarming rates," Mr. Phillippi of Shearson
says.
   Bulls make a cogent case that auto companies are healthier
than they were during the last slump. They argue that
earnings from sales in Europe and from light trucks in the
U.S., as well as profits from their captive finance
subsidiaries, have reduced the companies' exposure to an auto
slump in North America.
   Also, bulls note, auto sales have been falling since 1987;
there is hope, at least, that the auto cycle is near its
bottom, even if a nationwide recession may be only just
beginning. And, they say, consumers who bought cars in 1985
and 1986 -- banner years -- are ready for new ones.
   "What makes this time different?" Mr. Gruet of UBS says.
"The companies are stronger {financially} than in the past
and more diversified."
   But the earnings of the auto makers' finance companies are
linked to auto sales. And what if a recession, as some
forecast, were to hit Europe, too? Indeed, Japanese auto
makers are expected to increase market share in Europe, no
matter how the economy fares.
   The auto companies also have problems that go beyond the
looming recession. Ford, in the midst of an intense capital
spending program, is projected by analysts to have negative
cash flow next year. And GM is hurting from a long-term slide
in its market share.
   "The concern we have isn't so much a cyclical downturn,"
Scott Sprinzen of Standard &amp; Poor's says. For Ford and GM,
it's the loss of market share "due to imports and
transplants, and the concern that these trends could occur in
Europe," he says.
   Finally, there is the specter of higher oil prices. No one
knows whether oil prices will stay at current levels, but as
long as they do, Mr. Phillippi says, "It could have a hell of
an impact on consumers."
