   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Chicago, fired 213 employees at its
unprofitable catalog unit as part of a broad attempt to cut
costs and improve retailing profits.
   The latest cuts represent 20% of the catalog unit's
headquarters staff, which is shrinking to 821 people, from
about 1,700 in January 1989. The catalog unit, with annual
sales of about $4 billion, hasn't made money since 1985.
Sears predicts it will be profitable next year.

   Sears also may reduce the number of employees staffing
catalog desks at its 850 stores and its free-standing catalog
offices. The company currently is installing a new computer
system that it expects will reduce the time required to
handle merchandise returns by 35% to 40%. That system, now in
operation at 200 catalog locations, could result in further
staff reductions, a spokesman acknowledged.
