   BUSINESSES PROTEST plans to deny deductions for interest
on their tax debts.
   The 1986 tax act eliminated personal deductions of
interest on tax underpayments. On Sept. 6, Rep. Stark (D.,
Calif.), calling for equal treatment, entered a bill to deny
such deductions to corporations. To businesses' dismay, his
proposal has popped up among items tentatively accepted by
both Democrat and Republican budget negotiators, who say it
may raise $4.5 billion over five years. So major trade groups
-- including manufacturers, bankers and doctors -- are
mounting an attack on the plan.

   Interest is an ordinary and necessary business expense,
they say, and often stems from protracted good-faith disputes
over complex law. The corporate Tax Executives Institute
calls the proposal "gimmickry" meant to force corporations to
rush to pay interest before it takes effect in 1991. Andre
Fogarasi of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., CPAs, says the proposal
would disrupt audits and the newly revised penalty system.
   For individuals and corporations, interest paid on overdue
tax refunds would remain taxable under the proposal.
                                                                                                       

   HE LOST FAITH in conversion after this foreign-exchange
loss.
   A U.S. citizen we'll call Cosmo bought a place abroad in
1986 for local currency -- let's say 95,000 clams, equal then
to $95,000. He financed it with an 85,000-clam mortgage and
made it his home. Cosmo sold his home in 1989 for 142,000
clams and used 85,000 to pay off the mortgage, leaving a gain
taxable on his U.S. return. On that return, he must convert
clams into dollars at the rates in effect at the time of the
transactions. Trouble is, the dollar fell 5% against the clam
between 1986 and 1989.
   In clams, Cosmo did all right. But in dollars -- just on
his return -- he paid $4,474 more to retire the loan than he
borrowed, so he has an exchange loss. Naturally, he wants to
deduct the loss from his sale gain. But IRS Revenue Ruling
90-79 says he can't: A mortgage transaction is treated
separately from a home purchase and sale. Tax law limits
personal-loss deductions to those from a business, an
income-producing activity, or a casualty. Losses on home
mortgages don't qualify. (A gain on selling a home is
taxable; a loss isn't deductible.)
                                                                                                       

   OLD IRONSIDES the boat isn't, but the IRS can't sell it as
perishable goods.
   On June 1, the IRS seized a $72,500 cutter from Gerald A.
Galusha, a confessed marijuana grower, fearing he would try
to evade an alleged $223,000 in back taxes. The IRS put the
47-foot, 24-year-old sailboat in dry dock in Seattle and
planned its sale on Aug. 1 if Galusha didn't post a $72,500
bond. But he turned to the Tax Court: While a case is pending
there, the IRS may sell seized assets only on certain
conditions. One is that the property is perishable. The IRS
claimed it could meet the terms.
   The IRS said the wood hull would deteriorate rapidly in
dry dock or even in the water without extensive maintenance.
It also argued that maintenance costs would reduce sale
proceeds and that the boat's value would drop if a sale were
delayed. Now Judge Gerber has granted Galusha's plea to stay
a sale pending the outcome of the tax case. "Perishable"
means rapid decay, the judge said, yet proper care in the
water should preserve the boat for years.
   Also, the IRS failed to show the boat was losing value or
that maintenance would be too costly, the judge added.
                                                                                                       

   AFFORDABLE-HOUSING aid for the poor in metropolitan areas
now qualifies for Missouri state-income-tax credits of as
much as 55% of eligible expenses. Total annual credits are
limited to $2 million in the first year, but the ceiling
rises eventually to $10 million.
                                                                                                       

   INCOME-TAX TREATIES with West Germany, Spain, Finland,
Tunisia, India, and Indonesia were ratified by the Senate. It
also agreed to a treaty to share tax data with certain
nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
                                                                                                       

   A NEW ESTATE-TAX RETURN, Form 706, has been delayed again
at least until mid-October. Due first in August and then this
month, it will replace the 1988 version and reflects several
changes in the law.
                                                                                                       

   A GETTY SON finds a way without a will to get $10 million
tax-free.
   J. Ronald Getty, eldest son of J. Paul Getty, felt
short-changed when the billionaire left most of his wealth to
the Getty Museum in 1976. Ronald Getty sued the museum,
claiming his father reneged on a promised bequest, and
settled for $10 million in 1980. To him, the cash was in lieu
of a bequest; he didn't report it on his return. But to the
IRS, it was ordinary income, taxable in 1980 at the 70% top
rate; and in 1988, the Tax Court agreed the money replaced
lost income, not inherited property.
   Ronald Getty appealed. Now the ninth-circuit appeals court
has upheld his stand. While the Tax Court saw ambiguity in
the facts, appellate Judge Thompson says a preponderance of
the evidence shows that Getty sued the museum to reclaim a
lost bequest. Thus, the settlement payment should be treated
as tax-free property, not income.
   The Tax Court's 1988 ruling noted that Getty had spent $2
million in legal fees in suing the museum.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The non-profit NCAA isn't taxable on advertising
income from basketball-tourney programs, the 10th-circuit
appeals court says, reversing the Tax Court. . . . Fighting
intensified audits of small pension plans, the American
Society of Pension Actuaries wins a court order directing the
IRS to disclose documents on which a $666 million tax-revenue
estimate was based.
