   MCI Communications Corp. said it plans to offer
high-capacity data transmission services that can provide an
alternative to private-line service.
   MCI, the nation's second largest long-distance company,
said it will begin rolling out its "virtual private data
services" in mid-1991, beginning with switched services over
high-speed T1 and T3 circuits. T1 circuits have the capacity
of 24 telephone lines, while T3 circuits are equivalent to
672. Both are now available only as dedicated circuits or as
part of special services that must be reserved in advance.

   The new data services, targeted primarily for big
corporate customers, were demonstrated at the
Telecommunications Association's annual convention in San
Diego, with Cray Research Inc. using switched T3 circuits to
link a supercomputer in Minneapolis with a workstation in San
Diego.
   Don Heath, MCI's vice president for data marketing, said
the new services mean that a "computer's location won't be an
obstacle" to researchers, industrial designers, financial
experts or other users.
