   FAIRFAX, Va. -- Mobil Corp. said its vice chairman,
Richard Tucker, would retire May 1, 1991, but will leave the
post early to conduct a six-month study of factors currently
affecting the oil and gas industry.
   The retirement of the 63-year-old Mr. Tucker, who is also
president of the company's Mobil Oil Corp. unit, coincides
with the expiration of his three-year board term. No
successors have been named. The company said it would make
some staff realignments, effective Oct. 1, in line with the
start of the project by Mr. Tucker.

   Mobil said that previously, neither its chairman and chief
executive, Allen E. Murray, nor Mr. Tucker had the needed
time to meet with world and industry leaders to discuss
global changes affecting the company. An early leave, the
company said, "frees up" Mr. Tucker to study its changing
business environment. Mr. Tucker couldn't be reached for
comment.
   "In view of the turbulence and uncertainty facing our
industry, I felt this was the appropriate time to ask Mr.
Tucker to take on this study of the major changes that will
influence Mobil's future direction," Mr. Murray said in a
statement. He cited conflict in the Middle East, changes in
Eastern Europe, accelerating environmental concerns and
general economic uncertainty among those changes.
   Prior to being named to his present positions, Mr. Tucker
served as president of Mobil Diversified Businesses,
overseeing the operations of a number of businesses,
including Mobil Chemical, the company's mining and minerals
unit and the Montgomery Ward stores. Mobil sold the retail
chain in 1988.
   Mr. Murray, 61, retains the titles of chairman, chief
executive and president of Mobil Corp., and chairman and
chief executive of Mobil Oil Corp.
