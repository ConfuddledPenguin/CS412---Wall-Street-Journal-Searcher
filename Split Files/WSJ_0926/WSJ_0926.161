   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Six days after their $18-a-share
offer for all of Justin Industries Inc. was rejected by the
board, a group of dissident shareholders launched a tender
offer featuring similar terms.
   The bid came only hours after a federal judge in Fort
Worth denied a motion seeking to force Justin to hold a
special shareholders' meeting. The judge also refused to halt
or delay Justin's planned acquisition of Tony Lama Co. for $9
a share, or $18 million, plus the assumption of about $34
million in debt. The dissidents said they would appeal.

   In a prepared response, the company said it would take a
position on the tender offer on or before Oct. 9, and it
asked shareholders not to make a decision until then.
   The dissidents, led by Perry H. Sutherland of Kansas City,
Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York, said they are
offering to buy about 6.2 million shares of Justin common for
$18 apiece, or about $111 million. That, combined with the
nearly 12% stake they already own, would give them a 78%
stake.
   If the offer is completed, the dissidents said they will
merge Justin into a newly formed entity -- JTN Acquisition
Corp.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Justin shares closed
at $15, up $1.25.
   The dissidents said their offer is contingent on the
receipt of tenders from holders representing enough Justin
common to boost the stake of the buyers to 66.7% on a fully
diluted basis. They said the offer, which expires Oct. 23, is
also contingent on their obtaining sufficient financing.
   This represents the group's third proposal this year to
buy Justin, a maker of Western boots, bricks and building
materials. The board rejected the two previous offers.
