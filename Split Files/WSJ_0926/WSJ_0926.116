   COLUMBUS, Ind. -- Cummins Engine Co. said it expects to
report a loss for the third quarter as a result of slack
demand, even after a one-time gain of up to $34 million from
the repurchase of debt securities.
   The diesel-engine maker said that, excluding the gain, its
third-quarter loss will exceed the $39.7 million loss
reported in last year's third quarter. Slow North American
demand for heavy truck engines and related parts is expected
to continue through the fourth quarter, leaving the company
with a loss for that period as well, Cummins said.

   Cummins said that it will report a $12 million
extraordinary gain in the third quarter from the repurchase
of $200 million principal amount of Liquid Yield Option
Notes, or Lyons, from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Inc. in a private transaction. The securities trade at a deep
discount to their face value and pay interest at maturity.
   The company said an additional one-time gain in the third
quarter of up to $22 million will be realized if all of the
$375 million principal amount of its remaining Lyon
securities outstanding are tendered in response to an offer
beginning today.
   Cummins said it intends to file an offering of as much as
$150 million in medium-term notes to fund the repurchase of
the Lyon securities. Also helping fund the repurchase will be
a private placement of $74 million in tax-advantaged notes by
Cummins's employee stock ownership plan. The private
placement proceeds will be used to repay a promissory note
the ESOP issued to the company in July 1989, Cummins said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Cummins shares rose $1.25 to close at $36.25.
