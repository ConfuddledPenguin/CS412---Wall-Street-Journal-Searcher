   WASHINGTON -- President Bush appeared to be losing support
from his top lieutenants in Congress for a cut in
capital-gains taxes, one of his priorities in the budget
talks.
   "There will be a price to be paid if we continue to insist
on it, and in my opinion the doggone price is too steep,"
House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said before
the closed-door budget talks resumed last night.

   Earlier in the week, Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
said he didn't want the capital-gains controversy to stand in
the way of a compromise with the Democrats. Democrats have
been demanding that income-tax rates on the rich be raised if
capital-gains tax rates are cut; the administration won't go
along.
   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee took a step
toward delaying automatic spending cuts that would cripple
the federal government, and President Bush promptly pledged
to veto such a measure unless budget negotiators reach a
compromise first. "I do not want to see further delay in
kicking this problem on down the road," he told reporters.
   The stopgap spending bill would fund the government until
Oct. 20 and forestall budget cuts mandated by the
Gramm-Rudman law due to take effect Monday.
   Republicans will make an effort to strike the Gramm-Rudman
waiver on the floor and, mindful of the politics of seeming
to be weak on budget discipline, some leading Democrats are
themselves uncertain how to proceed.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
said last night that he might side with Republicans against
any delay in the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts in an effort to
keep both sides' "feet to the fire."
   The president's insistence on reducing capital-gains tax
rates remains a formidable obstacle to a budget accord,
although not the only one. People close to the talks say
Democratic and Republican negotiators have discussed narrower
alternatives to the Bush administration's proposal to lower
the tax on profits from the sale of almost all assets. "What
the Democrats are trying to do is provide a face-saving exit
for the administration," one congressional staffer said. At
least some Republicans are receptive, Rep. Michel among them.
   Among the options that have been discussed are:
restricting the lower tax rate to profits on new investments,
maintaining the current tax rates but taxing only profit in
excess of inflation and limiting the lower tax rate to
investments in start-up companies. House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) is said to be particularly
interested in the third option, which has long been advocated
by some other Democrats.
   Meanwhile, among rank and file members of Congress, who
are increasingly anxious about the budget stalemate, a new
controversy erupted yesterday when some House Democrats heard
that congressional pay would be targeted under one tentative
savings proposal.
   The idea was to balance a proposed delay in cost-of-living
adjustments for federal retirees with a similar delay in
congressional raises. But by day's end, the proposals for
both lawmakers and retirees had been scrapped, one top
leadership aide said.
   Although most attention is focused on the proposal to
delay the Gramm-Rudman cuts, there is pressure within the
White House to veto any spending bill even if the waiver
provision isn't included.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told Senate
Republicans yesterday the option of a government shutdown was
being considered, and people close to Budget Director Richard
Darman said he might recommend a veto of any continuing
resolution without a budget agreement.
   That could bring major portions of the government to a
halt and heighten the confrontation. The administration could
gain some flexibility under precedents allowing it to retain
essential personnel, including much of the Pentagon and law
enforcement workers, who might be furloughed otherwise under
the Gramm-Rudman cuts. Ironically, the cuts themselves are
blunted in the absence of a resolution because there is no
spending authority from which to cut.
   The prolonged negotiations this year have contributed to
extraordinary delays in enactment of the required annual
spending bills. Congress has yet to give final approval to
any of the 13 appropriations measures for fiscal 1991, and a
$52.26 billion agriculture and rural development bill which
cleared the Senate late yesterday is only the fifth such
appropriations bill to pass the chamber for 1991.
   The 79-19 roll call on the farm bill came as the Senate
Appropriations Committee separately approved a nearly $78.6
billion measure funding science, housing, and veterans
programs for the new fiscal year and incorporating major
reductions in the administration's space program. Virtually
all new money for the Moon and Mars initiative is denied, and
the bill calls for a 35% or $863.6 million reduction from the
president's request for the space station in fiscal 1991.
   Total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration would grow to $13.45 billion; but Sen.
Barbara Mikulski (D., Md.), who chairs the NASA subcommittee,
said the space station cut was "devastating" to the program.
   The CRAF-Cassini project, an ambitious follow-on to the
celebrated Voyager mission, is expected to lose one of its
two spacecraft under threatened cuts elsewhere in NASA's
budget. And the space reductions touch a set of political
interests from conservative Texas lawmakers to such academic
institutions as the University of Arizona, which has a stake
in the CRAF project to explore a comet and asteroid.
   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee postponed
any action on President Bush's request to forgive Egypt's
military debts to the U.S. and, instead, approved a
three-month waiver of penalties if Cairo fails to meet
scheduled payments through December.
   The bipartisan leadership vowed to pursue some compromise
in the coming weeks.
