   OLD GREENWICH, Conn. -- American Brands Inc. said it
declared a 2-for-1 stock split on its common shares and
increased its quarterly dividend on the post-split stock by
13%.
   The additional shares from the split will be distributed
Oct. 25 to stockholders of record Oct. 9, the company said.
After the split, about 197 million shares will be
outstanding. The lastest move represents American Brands'
third stock split in the last decade. The company split the
stock 2-for-1 in 1981 and 1986.

   American Brands also declared a dividend of 38.5 cents a
share on the post-split shares, payable Dec. 1 to holders of
record Nov. 8. The dividend is equal to 77 cents on each
share prior to the split, which is nine cents a share, or
about 13%, more than it has been paying.
   William J. Alley, chairman and chief executive officer,
said American Brands expects another "record year in 1990,"
and that the stock split and the dividend increase reflect
"the board's continued confidence in the prospects for the
company." He didn't elaborate beyond the statement.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Brands common shares closed at $68 a share, up $1.75
   In 1989, the company earned $630.8 million, or $6.51 a
share, up 20% from its previous year, on revenue of $11.92
billion. For the first six months of this year, American
Brands reported net income of $353.8 million, or $3.62 a
share, up 20%, on revenue of $6.16 billion, compared with
year-earlier net of $292.4 million, or $3.05 a share, on
revenue of $5.99 billion.
   The company makes cigarette brands such as Lucky Strike
and Carlton, liquors including Jim Beam whiskey, and Titleist
golf balls. It also provides life insurance through the
Franklin group of companies, operates the Wilson Jones office
products business, and recently acquired Moen Group Inc., a
faucet maker, from Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. for $975 million.
