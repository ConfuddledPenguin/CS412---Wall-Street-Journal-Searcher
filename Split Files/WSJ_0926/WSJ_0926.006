   BRUSSELS -- The European Community's energy commissioner,
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, warned against further rises in oil
prices and called the recent surge "totally unjustified and
indefensible."
   Mr. Cardoso e Cunha accused traders of speculating "at the
expense of the consumers." He said oil stocks remain at
unusually high levels, despite the Persian Gulf crisis, a
fact known by "everyone on the market."

   He also disputed the perception that a Gulf war would
result in oil shortages. "The speculators should remind
themselves that both countries continued to produce and
export oil throughout the Iran-Iraq war, despite repeated
attacks on their oil facilities," he said, and predicted that
markets would soon realize this, leaving companies and
traders holding high-priced oil to face big losses. "They
will deserve no public sympathy," he said. "But in the
meantime, we are all suffering from their misguided actions."
   The International Energy Agency on Friday is to discuss
oil stocks, but the EC commission isn't viewed as likely to
recommend releasing strategic stocks to push prices down.
