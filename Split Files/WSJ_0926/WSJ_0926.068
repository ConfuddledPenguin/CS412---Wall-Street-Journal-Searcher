   WASHINGTON -- Mayors, congressmen and regional officials
from around the country dismissed the preliminary 1990 census
count as woefully low, with representatives of the Conference
of Mayors calling the effort "a $2.6 billion colossal flop."
   In testimony before the House subcommittee that oversees
the Census Bureau, officials offered a laundry list of
complaints about inaccuracies in the count.

   "We have been promised the most accurate census count in
history," Rep. Mike Espy (D., Miss.) testified, but added
that even Mississippi's governor and secretary of state were
missed. "If the preliminary numbers are any indication, we
may be on the verge of the most inaccurate count in history,"
he said.
   The preliminary count, the bureau insists, is incomplete
and designed to be only one step in the long process toward a
full count. Nonetheless, many cities and some rural areas are
up in arms as lower-than-expected figures threaten
congressional apportionment and federal spending.
   While the current round of accusations may have little
effect on the final 1990 count, it presages a lengthy season
of litigation ahead. The Commerce Department, which has
authority over the Census Bureau, was sued 52 times over
alleged errors in the count and bureau's methods in the 1980
census.
   On Monday, some cities and localities returned their own
estimates of how many housing units the bureau supposedly
missed. The process, known as post-census local review, gives
cities and localities 15 days to review the bureau's
preliminary figures so they can tell the bureau where they
may have missed housing units. The census bureau then
recanvasses some of those areas.
   For confidentiality and other reasons, the bureau releases
to local officials only the number of housing units within
blocks the bureau itself designates, rather than the number
of people within each block. This presents an important
obstacle in redressing the count, local officials say,
because a missed unit -- such as a college dormitory or a
group house -- often misses many people, magnifying errors
and omissions.
   Officials said the 15-day review period isn't enough. They
also said that advanced survey methodology has rendered the
constitutionally mandated head count obsolete. "The fact of
the matter is, we have reached the point where scientific
projections are more accurate than counting," Baltimore Mayor
Kurt Schmoke said.
   Barbara Bryant, director of the Census Bureau, addressed
many of the concerns during her testimony and defended the
bureau's integrity. "We sympathized with those officials who
have to govern cities losing or not gaining population and
tax base," she said, "but we should not be blamed for such
changes. In effect, there should be no shooting of the
proverbial messenger in anticipation of bad news."
   Mr. Schmoke expressed the desire of many of the mayors
when he called on the Census Bureau to allow the cities one
last chance to correct the count before it goes to the
president next spring. But Ms. Bryant said that wouldn't be
possible because federal law requires that the final count be
done by the federal government alone: "This," she said in
reference to the local review, "was their chance to give
their counts."
   According to Ms. Bryant, seven cities have contested the
housing count in at least 2,000 blocks. The seven are
Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Honolulu, New York and
Philadelphia. New York has voiced the loudest complaint of
the major cities, claiming that more than 250,000 housing
units and as many as one million people were missed in the
preliminary count.
