   DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built cars and trucks
fell 5.7% in mid-September from a strong year-ago period. The
drop was surprisingly small given the soaring gasoline prices
and a slowing economy.
   Some of the strength in the market, analysts said, came
from buyers snapping up 1990-model cars before the
higher-priced 1991 models hit the showroom. "Even skittish
consumers are finding the model year close-out bargains too
good to pass up," said Thomas Webb, chief economist for the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The 1991 model year
begins Monday.

   The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for passenger
cars was a robust 7.8 million vehicles, compared with a hot
8.3 million annual rate a year ago and a 7.1 million rate in
early September.
   Overall, the 10 domestic car makers sold 322,216 vehicles
in the second 10 days of September, down 5.7% from the 1989
period. Domestic truck sales fell 10.6%, but domestic car
sales were much stronger, declining only 2.6%.
   The drop in truck sales, which in recent years have been
more robust than car sales, indicates that some consumers are
nervous about rising gasoline prices. But some models of
large cars continue to sell well, showing that there hasn't
yet been a wholesale shift toward smaller, fuel-efficient
cars.
   "You still get some people who don't care about the
mileage," said Roy Watson, sales manager of Forest Lake
Chrysler and Forest Lake Ford in Minnesota. "They just drive
what they want to drive."
   The Japanese auto makers continued to post strong gains in
sales of vehicles produced in their U.S. assembly plants.
Nissan Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. each more than doubled
sales of domestically assembled vehicles from the year-ago
period.
   Not all Japanese auto makers fared as well. Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. sales of domestically produced cars fell 6.8%
from a year ago. Mitsubishi said it had a generous
dealer-incentive program running this time last year, and
that the company also is running short of its sporty Eclipse
models.
   But economic and political uncertainties also are taking
their toll, the company conceded. Showroom traffic is off 40%
from two months ago, said Richard S. Recchia, head of
Mitsubishi's U.S. sales arm. "A lot of people have deferred
the decision to buy until they see what will happen with the
economy and the Middle East," Mr. Recchia added.
   Ford Motor Co. put in the strongest performance of the
U.S. Big Three car makers. Ford's domestic car sales fell
7.3% while its domestic truck sales were down 7.9%.
   Ford's efforts to revive sales of its Escort subcompact
car appear to be working. Escort sales, which sagged earlier
in the year despite the introduction of a revamped model,
were up 11.2% from a year ago. Sales have been mounting ever
since Ford placed consumer incentives on the car in August.
   General Motors Corp. posted a 9.6% drop in total vehicles
sales, including a 16.3% drop in domestic truck sales.
Domestic car sales were down 6.4% while sales of GM's
imported cars, which included its fuel-efficient Geo line,
rose 10.4%.
   Chrysler Corp., hurting all year, continued to struggle in
mid-September. Domestic car sales dropped 12.1% from a year
ago, while domestic truck sales -- including Jeeps and
minivans -- declined 18.5%.
