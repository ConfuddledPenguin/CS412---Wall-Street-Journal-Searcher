   Your Aug. 23 editorial "Squirreling Away Science" on the
Mount Graham red squirrel-University of Arizona telescope
controversy distorted the scientific record and trivialized
the issue. By choosing to make light of "squirrels, owls and
cuckoos," you have undermined your own journalistic
integrity.
   You would have us believe that the initial biological
opinion -- indicating that construction of the telescopes
would not harm the squirrels -- was a valid judgment that was
"stalled" by environmental groups. In fact, the biologists
who rendered the original opinion admitted in court
depositions and in testimony before Congress that they had
been pressured into reaching their conclusions. When U.S.
Fish and Wildlife (FWS) biologists reported new information
in their biological update, they were evaluating a flawed,
outdated opinion. The need for further study is not some
environmental conspiracy; it is the professional opinion of a
blue-ribbon panel of federal biologists.

   Contrary to your editorial, the new FWS report did not
conclude that "the original biological opinion wasn't wrong."
The report found new evidence that building the telescopes
could harm both the squirrels and their habitat, including a
decline in population density and greater population
fluctuations. It enumerated other factors not considered
earlier, such as tree disease, pest infestations of trees,
fire history and predation. Evidently you either overlooked
these facts or preferred instead to write about squirrels not
returning phone calls.
   It is a mistake to trivialize the discussion of
environmental issues or to weigh in with merely superficial
coverage. A majority of Americans do not consider the
extinction of species and the loss of precious habitats in
this country to be a joke. We would all be better served if
more journalists spent at least as much time researching
their subjects as they do joking about them.

   You fall prey to a popular misconception of science and
scientists. This misconception stems from confusing science,
defined as the systematic study of physical phenomena based
on observation and experiment, with the equipment employed in
a few areas of scientific research. The result is an
erroneous assumption that the validity of scientific research
is directly proportional to the size and cost of the
equipment involved. You seem to imply that "serious
scientific minds" belong only to esoteric individuals
(uniformly attired in horn-rimmed glasses and white lab
coats) who spend their time tinkering with
multimillion-dollar instruments in their sterile "scientific"
laboratories. In fact, "serious scientific minds" are those
most likely to be fascinated equally by biological traits
characterizing obscure subspecies of "squirrels, owls and
cuckoos" as in astronomical observations measuring the
pulsation of cepheid (variables).
