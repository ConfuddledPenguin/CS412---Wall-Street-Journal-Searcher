   LOS ANGELES -- A California appeals court declined to
review Charles H. Keating Jr.'s $5 million bail, leaving the
indicted former American Continental Corp. chairman to begin
a second week in jail.
   Chicago attorney Stephen C. Neal, who maintains the
66-year-old Mr. Keating is deeply in debt and unable to raise
such an amount, could appeal next to the state supreme court,
although he declined to comment yesterday on what his next
legal step.

   Mr. Keating and three other officers of either Phoenix,
Ariz.-based American Continental or its Lincoln Savings unit
in California were charged by a state grand jury with
defrauding California purchasers of about $250 million of
uninsured American Continental bonds by making false claims
about the safety of the securities. They surrendered early
last week and are scheduled for a formal arraignment on Oct.
5.
   The co-defendents returned home last weekend after
successfully petitioning for reductions from the $1 million
bail originally set for them. At the same time, however, the
state Judge Gary Klausner refused to reconsider Mr. Keating's
$5 million bail, and said he believed the Arizona businessman
might have reasons to flee from the criminal prosecution, and
other legal and financial problems.
   Mr. Neal criticized as "wholely inappropriate and inept"
remarks on Friday by Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira
Reiner, who said Mr. Keating's mug shot "ought to be posted
in every boardroom in the United States," and compared the
Keating case to that of fugitive financier Robert Vesco.
   Mr. Keating's attorneys maintained in their petition to
the appeals court that Mr. Keating is "unlawfully imprisoned"
because he doesn't present a flight risk and has bail "50
times higher than bail set for other defendants faced with
identical charges." Mr. Neal had told Judge Klausner that Mr.
Keating is interested only in defending himself against the
charges, but that he "can't prepare a defense from L.A.
County Jail. It is impossible."
