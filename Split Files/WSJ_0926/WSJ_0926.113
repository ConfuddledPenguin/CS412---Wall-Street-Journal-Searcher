   Tokyo stocks finished broadly and substantially lower in
razor-thin trading Tuesday as the latest rise in oil prices
and falling bond prices kept investors off the trading floor.
   In London, shares finished higher, but only marginally
better than Monday's 20-month low and still under the 2000
support level on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share
Index.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 418.51 points, or
1.76%, to 23359.32.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell another 437.69
points to close the morning session at 22921.63.
   Sentiment on Tuesday was also damped by sharp falls in
stock prices Monday in London and New York, which were also
prompted by higher oil prices, traders said.
   Most shares in Tokyo fell on a small amount of selling
because of the lack of buy orders, with big losers spread
among stocks sensitive to interest rates and oil prices.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 230 million
shares, down from 458 million shares Friday. The market was
closed Monday for a holiday.
   Decliners outnumbered gainers 825 to 139, while 92 were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 50.41 points, or 2.85%, at 1719.36.
   The second section index dropped 61.92 points, or 1.85%,
to 3280.17. Volume in the section was estimated at 4 million
shares, down from 7.9 million shares Friday.
   While most investors remained on the sidelines, the Nikkei
Index slumped under the pressures of a small amount of
arbitrage selling and sharp declines in bluechip shares from
selling by some foreign investors, traders said.
   Some traders, however, said stock prices could have fallen
more, taking into account that both oil prices and the
benchmark yield of Japanese bond rose to the highest levels
in about a decade.
   But stocks managed to finish well above intraday lows.
Partly helped by index-linked buying by investment trust
funds, the index bounced up whenever it neared 23200 points,
traders said.
   "There is a market consensus that we have to defend 23000
points to the last," said a senior trader at Wako Securities.
   If the Nikkei falls below 23000 points, it is said that
Japanese banks would no longer be able to meet new capital
ratio requirements of the Bank for International Settlements,
he said.
   Other financial institutions and securities firms will
also be eager to prevent further losses toward the end of
September as the value of their holdings are evaluated
according to market prices on the last day of the month, the
trader said.
   Tuesday was the first trading day for the second half of
Japan's fiscal year, which begins Monday.
   "I haven't seen such a quiet day at the beginning of a
month for a long time," said Atsushi Koishihara, general
manager of stock trading at Taiheiyo Securities.
   Brokerage houses, which are usually active buyers on the
first day of a month, were forced to remain on the sidelines
like other investors, Mr. Koishihara said. "We can't move
because if turnover continues to thin, we wouldn't be able to
sell what we would buy today," he said.
   "The Mideast situation is too unclear," a fund manager at
Nippon Life Insurance said.
   Speculation that a further rise in oil prices may push up
domestic interest rates even higher "put us in real
discomfort," he said.
   Kobe Steel again became the most heavily traded issue,
ending at 566 yen ($4.12), up 1 yen. A news conference
scheduled by Kobe Steel for the late afternoon prompted
speculative buying, traders said.
   After the market closed, Kobe Steel announced plans to
form a joint venture to produce and sell aluminum products in
Japan with Aluminum Co. of America.
   Electric power companies were sold as their earnings are
likely to be pushed down by higher oil prices, traders said.
Tokyo Electric Power fell 120 yen to 3070 yen, while Kansai
Electric Power fell 120 yen to 2330 yen.
   Blue-chip electricals also slumped, with Hitachi dropping
70 yen to 1210 yen and Matsushita Electric Industrial
declining 90 yen to 1630 yen.
   In London, traders said that the gains weren't significant
when compared to recent swings in the stock market, and don't
suggest a continuing upward trend. Traders remain uncertain
as to the course London will follow with so many domestic and
international concerns to contend with.
   The FT-SE 100 Share Index gained 8.9 points to 1999.2. The
Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 16.2 points to 1526.6.
Volume was 412.4 million shares, under Monday's level of
500.3 million.
   Building products group Tarmac PLC reported half-year
pretax profit down 36% to #97.8 million ($184.3 million),
prompting securities house Charterhouse Tilney to downgrade
its year-end pretax profit figure to #235 million from #265
million. However, the shares ended a penny higher at 195
pence on relief the results weren't worse, traders said.
   Thorn EMI, the music, rentals and electricals concern,
rose 15 pence to 598 pence. Traders attributed the gain as a
sympathetic rise in line with other entertainment stocks on
news that Matsushita is preparing to bid for MCA of the U.S.
   BAA, the airport ownership and management concern, fell 7
1/2 pence to 367 1/2 pence. Traders said that industial
conglomerate ADT had sold a large stake.
   Property investment and development group Land Securities
fell 5 pence to 449 pence. Traders said there had been much
stock on offer, after several months in which the share price
had been unreasonably high.
   Food maker Rank Hovis McDougall fell 5 pence to 279 pence.
Traders said the price eased as extra stock entered the
market.
   In the stores sector, supermarket chains Tesco and
Sainsbury ended lower. Both stocks, among the market's best
performers of late, were considered expensive by traders,
prompting profit-taking. Tesco dropped 6 pence to 218 pence,
while Sainsbury dropped 4 pence to 290 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan, Madrid and Brussels.
South African gold stocks closed higher.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Seoul, lower in Wellington,
Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney.
