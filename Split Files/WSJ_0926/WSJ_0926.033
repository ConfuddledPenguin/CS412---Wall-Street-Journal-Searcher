   DALLAS -- BSN Corp., sporting-equipment maker, said its
president, Michael Blumenfeld, filed an amended 13D report
with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflecting recent
purchases of 70,300 shares of BSN common stock at prices from
$5.125 to $6.25 a share.
   The purchases raise Mr. Blumenfeld's interest in BSN to
approximately 18.5% from 16% previously, he said.

   Mr. Blumenfeld denied the purchase is related to recent
actions by a Houston investment group, Pelham Investment
Associates L.P. Pelham requested a list of BSN shareholders
and said recently it increased its share in BSN to 7.99%.
   The purchases were part of management plan to acquire as
many as 500,000 BSN shares, Mr. Blumenfeld said.
