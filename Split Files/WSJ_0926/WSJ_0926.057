   CALGARY, Alberta -- PWA Corp. said it plans to sell its
50% stake in GPA Jetprop Ltd., an aircraft trading and
leasing concern, to Ireland's GPA Group PLC, for proceeds of
about 26 million Canadian dollars (US$22.6 million).
   PWA, a holding company that owns Canadian Airlines
International Ltd., said the sale reflects its desire to sell
assets that don't fit its long-term plans. GPA Group is a
closely held aviation investment concern.
