   WASHINGTON -- Former investment banker Ira A. McCown Jr.,
considered by government prosecutors to be a key figure in a
continuing municipal-bond scandal, pleaded guilty to a
bond-related charge and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
   Mr. McCown was a senior vice president with Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. before leaving in 1986 to
form his own mortgage-brokerage firm. He pleaded guilty in
federal court in St. Louis to helping file a report with the
Internal Revenue Service in which a year-end 1985
municipal-bond issue was falsely described as being tax
exempt.

   Bond lawyer James Newman entered into a similar plea
agreement with the government nearly two years ago and has
cooperated extensively with prosecutors, according to his
lawyer, Stephen Sachs. Mr. Newman currently is serving a
two-year prison sentence. He also agreed to serve as a
government witness.
   James Martin, the assistant U.S. attorney in St. Louis,
said he expects indictments to be handed up by this summer in
connection with a "nationwide scheme" where "numerous"
municipal bonds were sold as tax-exempt securities when they
actually were "arbitrage bonds," which don't qualify for tax
exemption. The government said in court papers that the bonds
weren't tax exempt because the proceeds from their sale were
invested in higher-yielding instruments with "no reasonable
expectations that the proposed projects would ever be
constructed."
   The specific bond issue named in Mr. McCown's case was the
same $10,650,000 St. Louis County, Mo., Industrial
Development Authority issue cited in the Newman case. The
bonds, which were supposed to finance a housing project but
never did, were sold at the end of 1985 when billions of
dollars of municipal bonds were rushed to market to beat a
federal tax change.
