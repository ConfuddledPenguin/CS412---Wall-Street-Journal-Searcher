   World economic growth is threatened by the risk of
continuing increases in interest rates in the major
industrial countries. The seven big industrial countries
should launch a coordinated response to the problem when they
meet in Paris this weekend and in Washington in early May, as
they successfully did on several occasions to sustain global
growth in 1986.
   Adjusted for inflation, real interest rates now range from
about 4% in the U.S. and Japan to about 6% in Germany. These
levels are at least double the historical norm. Rates seem
sure to climb further in the absence of international
agreement on a ceasefire.

   Why are interest rates high and rising? Unlike the 1970s,
there is no risk of rapid inflation. Energy prices are
stable. Economic growth is modest, with little fear of
overheating. In the U.S., increases in labor costs in fact
decelerated over the past year and core inflation has not
risen. The modest blip in the price level in Japan is
explained by the adoption of its new consumption tax; a
similar blip in Germany has been caused by exaggerated
expectations of the impact of monetary unification with East
Germany.
   It is external, not internal, considerations that are
driving interest rates up in all the key countries. The U.S.
must attract $10 billion of capital inflow monthly to finance
its trade deficit. To keep the inflow coming, money markets
here must follow money markets abroad.
   Despite the recent strength of the dollar, American
authorities know that the influx of private foreign capital
could dry up at any moment (as it did in 1987). This would
push the dollar down sharply and inflation up. Despite the
Federal Reserve's rhetoric about the danger of inflation to
the domestic economy, its support for rising interest rates
derives largely from these international concerns. And
American interest rates are likely to keep going up if
foreign rates do.
   The world's weakest currency in recent months has been the
yen. This weakness is the main source of price inflation in
Japan, and it triggered the sharp decline in Japanese stock
prices. Massive currency intervention alone has failed to
defend the yen. Japan has thus raised its interest rates
sharply. The alternative is heightened trade tension with the
U.S., because higher Japanese trade surpluses will inexorably
result from a cheaper currency. Failing a coordinated
strategy, Japan will have to raise its rates again --
especially if American and European rates continue to climb.
   If that happens, Japanese investors may face a liquidity
squeeze, forcing them into general divestment from their
portfolios. Tokyo stocks will then tumble farther,
threatening the entire Japanese financial pyramid, as well as
the New York and other markets.
   The German mark has also weakened against the dollar.
Inflation-conscious Germans, aware that their economy is
already using all of its industrial capacity, seek a stronger
mark. But Germany's partners in the European Monetary System
will not accept a realignment against their currencies. So
the Bundesbank may raise interest rates again to try to
elevate the mark against the dollar. The bank will surely
follow any upward move from Washington.
   Interest rate hikes in each major country are being driven
to a considerable degree by developments in the others. The
result is an upward ratchet of rates that threatens growth
everywhere. The case for coordinated action is extremely
strong.
   The ideal package would be a modest reduction in American
interest rates coupled with pledges by Germany and Japan to
avoid further increases. This would halt the global monetary
tightening, encourage hesitant companies to resume investment
and promote continued growth. The package should also provide
for a renewed decline of the dollar, to resume the reduction
of America's trade deficits and enhance the pickup in the
world's weakest major economy.
   If a total ceasefire on higher interest rates cannot be
agreed upon, the U.S. should at least pledge to resist new
increases even if market forces do push foreign rates up a
bit more. Exchange rates would thus be moved in the right
direction and the incentives for authorities abroad to
tighten policy would be reduced.
   Such national commitments on monetary policy would be far
more credible if backed by fiscal tightening. The U.S., in
particular, needs to display decisive action on its budget
deficit. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated that
deficit reduction could cut two percentage points off U.S.
interest rates without risking faster inflation.
   Borrowing less on financial markets would be the greatest
contribution the U.S. could make to the capital needs of
Eastern Europe and Third World debtors. The recent proposals
by House Ways and Means committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski
(D., Ill.), which would convert the deficit into a surplus
over the next five years, offer a promising foreign policy
initiative as well as a reinvigoration of the U.S. economy
through lower interest rates and a stronger trade balance.
   Japanese fiscal policy is already neutral or slightly
restrictive. West Germany, however, should finance economic
unification with East Germany through a one-time tax increase
rather than a currency conversion that could increase
inflationary pressures and give interest rates another upward
shove.
   When world growth seemed to be flagging in 1986, the seven
big industrial economies coordinated interest rates
successfully and sustained the recovery. The situation was
different then because oil prices were falling and the dollar
faced downward pressure. But the same principles apply today,
and the seven can and should replicate their earlier efforts
in order to ensure continued growth and stability into the
1990s.
