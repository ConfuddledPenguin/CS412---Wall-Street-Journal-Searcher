   NEW YORK -- Lindner Fund's Robert Lange is a winner with
mutual fund investors, finishing fourth among the decade's
top performers with a gain of 660%, or 22.5% a year.
   The fund deserves a laurel because, unlike a handful of
better performers, it meets two important criteria: Lindner
Fund has had the same manager at the helm for the whole 10
years. And it is still accepting new investors.

   Lindner Fund tries to buy companies with little debt that
are cheap relative to earnings (after adjusting for
nonrecurring items). But because the fund's valuation
techniques are so stringent, the fund started shopping abroad
in 1984, and today has 19% of its assets in foreign stocks,
such as the chemical companies Akzo N.V. and Solvay &amp; Cie.
   The 45-year-old Mr. Lange, who runs the $654 million
no-load fund with a co-manager, 38-year-old Eric Ryback, says
the fund is now sitting on 20% cash. "When you get into the
upper reaches of the bull market, this sort of discipline
makes you not buy," says Mr. Lange, whose fund in the past
has held as much as 65% cash.
   The fund's third largest holding is Norsk Hydro AS, the
Norwegian maker of oil and gas products, petrochemicals and
fertilizers. Norsk Hydro trades on the New York Stock
Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.
   The fund has been dabbling in junk bonds since 1986, and
they now account for 10% of the fund's assets. Mr. Lange and
Mr. Ryback always avoid new issues and instead buy
well-seasoned bonds.
   The fund's largest bond position, bigger even than any of
its stockholdings, is in Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp. The
fund has recently been adding to its position.
   Mr. Lange took over managing Lindner Fund in 1977 from
Kurt Lindner, who founded the fund in 1954. "Kurt Lindner
used to work on the fund over his kitchen table at night,"
says Mr. Lange. Today, the 67-year-old Mr. Lindner still
keeps tabs on the fund, though most of the work is left to
Mr. Lange and Mr. Ryback, who became a co-manager of the fund
in 1984. "If we get an idea, we generally run it by Mr.
Lindner," says Mr. Lange. "He's the president and the boss.
He has the final say over what we do."
   Lindner Fund also goes after asset plays. Its largest
current bet is on Minorco S.A., which is controlled by South
Africa's Oppenheimer family and which has stakes in several
non-South African natural resource companies. Mr. Ryback puts
Minorco's net asset value per share at $23. The company,
which trades in the U.S. as an American depositary receipt,
closed yesterday at $15.75.
   Fidelity Magellan Fund was the top performer for the past
10 years, but manager Peter Lynch is leaving May 31, when
Morris Smith succeeds him. At No. 2 Merrill Pacific, fund
manager Stephen Silverman has managed the fund only since
1983 and so cannot rightfully claim the whole 10-year record.
The third-best performing fund, CGM Capital Development, has
been run by G. Kenneth Heebner since 1977 but is closed to
new investors. Another fund run by Mr. Heebner, New England
Growth, is open to new investors but hasn't done as well as
Robert Lange's fund.
                                                                                                       

   First-Quarter Leader:
                                                                                                       

   Strategic Gold/Minerals                   +19.15%
                                                                                                       

   Grant Brenna's tiny fund, Dallas-based Strategic
Gold/Minerals with just $3.9 million in assets, has a weak
track record. The fund, which is sold with an 8.5% sales
charge, has never outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock index in any year since its 1982 launch. In 1989 it was
the worst performing mutual fund.
   But when a fund concentrates its assets in just a few
stocks, it can get a huge boost when the market goes its way,
and that's just what happened with Strategic Gold/Minerals.
   The fund owns well-known North American mining companies
such as American Barrick Resources Corp., FMC Gold Co. and
Newmont Gold Co. But it wasn't any of these companies that
propelled Mr. Brenna to the top of the quarterly performance
charts.
   He got his biggest boost from a highly speculative bet on
Akiko-Lori Gold Resources Ltd., a Vancouver Stock Exchange
listed company that has announced a gold discovery in
Ontario, Canada. The stock has tripled since the beginning of
the year.
   "A lot of games are played on the Vancouver Stock
Exchange," notes Mr. Brenna. "We're fairly sure that the
shareholder base of Akiko-Lori will keep the promoter in
line. The difficult part is knowing when the market thinks
the stock is appropriately priced."
   Strategic Gold/Minerals' performance would have been even
stronger but for the drubbing that gold took on March 26,
falling $23 an ounce to $366. "I think gold right now -- this
week -- it's cheaper than hell," says Mr. Brenna. "The market
is trying to absorb the two million ounces that this Saudia
Arabian consortium sold to buy sterling. When that shakes
out, I expect gold to rise back to $390." Yesterday gold for
current delivery was quoted at $377.10, up $1.80 an ounce.
                                                                                                       

   12-Month Leader:

   Fidelity Select Energy Service            +50%
                                                                                                       

   For Fidelity Investments' sector funds, which invest in a
single industry, things tend to be all boom or all bust.
After performing pitifully through 1986, 1987 and 1988,
Fidelity Select Energy Service boomed.
   "The oil-field equipment and service index is up 46% over
the last year, and the drilling-industry index is up 45%, so
we start off being in a pretty good industry," notes David
Neisser, the fund's 27-year-old manager.
   The 1980s were a rough decade for energy-service
companies, but Mr. Neisser reckons the survivors will be
long-term beneficiaries of the decline in U.S. and Soviet oil
production.
   Over the past year, Mr. Neisser has tried to exploit what
he sees as four major trends in the energy-service business;
the increase in foreign oil drilling and exploration in
places such as the North Sea and Southeast Asia; the increase
in offshore drilling; the application of modern technology to
the drilling process; and, finally, the increase in
exploration for, and use of, natural gas.
   Two companies that Mr. Neisser reckons will benefit from
the growing interest in natural gas are Baker Hughes Inc. and
Enterra Corp. "It's a much cleaner fuel, so you're going to
see it used in much greater quantities," says Mr. Neisser.
"And it's an indigenous fuel, so to the extent that we can
replace imported oil with this indigenous fuel, we can
improve the trade deficit."
                                                                                                       

   Five-Year Leader
                                                                                                       

   Fidelity Overseas                        +304%
                                                                                                       

   Fidelity's fund managers have always prided themselves on
their intensive research on individual companies. Lofty
predictions about the stock market's direction aren't their
style.
   But George Noble, 33-year-old manager of $1 billion
Fidelity Overseas, stands apart from the rest at Fidelity. He
too does his intensive research on each individual stock
pick. But he also feels compelled to try to predict the
direction of specific foreign markets.
   "Let's not kid ourselves, the macro issues are very
important," he says. "If you get stuck in the wrong market,
forget it."
   For a lot of international fund managers, the wrong market
for 1990 has been Japan. Mr. Noble went into the year with
30% of his fund in Japanese stocks.
   "Nobody ever rings a bell for you in this business," he
says. "At the turn of the year, the bond market started to
decline, the yen was weakening. At the same time, the
Japanese stock market in the fourth quarter took off like a
rocket. You had a divergence between the equity market and
the bond market. We said to ourselves, `time out.' By the end
of February, we were down to 12% {of assets}. We're now at
5%, the lowest level since the inception of the fund."
   While the fund took its licks in Japan, it made its
biggest gains in West Germany, with 20% of assets invested in
companies like Rhein-West Electric, Siemens AG and Volkswagen
AG.
   In continental Europe generally, Mr. Noble is trying to
exploit the boom in infrastructure spending that is likely to
accompany the 1992 economic integration of Europe and the
opening-up of Eastern Europe. The fund's biggest bet is on
France's Cie. Generale D'Electricite, which is involved in
railway construction, telecommunications equipment,
shipbuilding and power-generation equipment.
