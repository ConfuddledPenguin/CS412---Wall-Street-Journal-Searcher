   WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved the nomination of
Timothy Ryan to be the nation's top savings-and-loan
regulator, effectively nullifying a court decision that had
derailed the overhaul of the thrift industry.
   The 62-37 vote confirming Mr. Ryan, a labor lawyer,
followed six hours of debate about whether he is qualified
for a job that governs the financial industry.

   The surprisingly wide margin reflected the pressure to
quickly confirm a director for the Office of Thrift
Supervision. A federal court in Washington ruled recently
that because the current director wasn't approved by the
Senate, his appointment was unconstitutional. Therefore, the
thrift office's future actions, which included government
seizures of hundreds of insolvent thrifts, were put on hold.
   Mr. Ryan, a former Labor Department lawyer and special
counsel to the Bush presidential campaign, succeeds Salvatore
Martoche, who had held the position for just a few weeks. Mr.
Martoche was an interim replacement for Danny Wall, who
announced his resignation in December after a series of
congressional hearings that criticized his handling of the
insolvency of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, Irvine,
Calif.
   Mr. Ryan takes over after the third consecutive year of
record-breaking losses in the thrift industry and during the
continuing enactment of the complex S&amp;L bailout law. He also
takes over at a thrift office that has narrower authority
than before the S&amp;L law. Dissatisfied with the predecessor
agency, Congress dissolved it and gave its thrift-oversight
duties to the OTS. Once S&amp;Ls become insolvent, the thrift
office turns them over to the Resolution Trust Corp. for sale
or liquidation.
   Mr. Ryan took over as the Resolution Trust Corp. announced
it will put up for bid 87 thrifts, with $35 billion in
assets, under a new, streamlined system of bidding. The
agency, under fire for slow sales of insolvent S&amp;Ls, aims to
have them sold by June 30.
   The new system will allow bidders to make extensive use of
options to return nonperforming investments to the
government. Knowing they won't be stuck with bad assets
indefinitely, bidders can make an assessment of the
institutions more quickly. The government, meanwhile, can get
a better price for the insolvent thrifts, before their
franchise values decline as they languish under government
management. The government would sell the bad assets later.
   In the Senate debate, Mr. Ryan's disclosure that he tried
marijuana and cocaine in the early 1970s was barely
discussed.
   Following the vote, however, Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.)
called for an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee
into leaks of Mr. Ryan's report to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, in which he voluntarily disclosed his drug
use. The reports are confidential to the Senate.
   Republicans argued that Mr. Ryan's experience in
enforcement of law was more important that his lack of
experience in the financial industry. "Let's face it," said
Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, "it's the insiders,
the so-called thrift experts, who got us where we are today."
   Mr. Ryan squeaked through the Senate Banking Committee
last week by an 11-10 vote, the day after committee Chairman
Donald Riegle said he doubted there were enough votes to
approve his nomination. Mr. Riegle said that nearly every
senator had been called by the Treasury Department, which
pressed for the candidate. "If a fraction of the time had
been spent finding a fully qualified nominee that's been
spent trying to push this nominee through, they'd have found
one," he said.
   Mr. Ryan will also be a member of the boards of the
Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
   It's rare that a presidential nominee is turned back by
the Senate, but the vote was more lopsided than expected.
Democratic leaders Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Daniel
Moynihan of New York voted with the president.
   While 17 Democrats voted for Mr. Ryan, some warned that
the slow-moving S&amp;L bailout -- $166 billion and growing -- is
becoming a Bush administration liability. "Somewhere inside
this there's a scandal that will tear the insides of the
country out," said Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.).
