   WASHINGTON -- The House gave final congressional approval
to a bill that would require the Justice Department for the
first time to collect and publish statistics on so-called
hate crimes.
   The measure, passed 402-18, now goes to President Bush,
who is expected to sign it.

   Hate crimes are those motivated by prejudice based on a
victim's race, religion, national origin or sexual
orientation. Despite increased federal investigation and
prosecution of such crimes, they have persisted in recent
years and may have even increased, according to surveys
conducted by various private organizations.
   "Many would say the problem has escalated," said Rep.
Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.), a leading sponsor of the
legislation. The bill would require the Justice Department to
collect hate crime statistics and publish them annually so
that federal, state and local law-enforcement officials can
measure trends and deploy resources more effectively.
