   Spokesmen for NV Philips and Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co.
confirmed rumors that the two electronics companies are
discussing possibile cooperation, but they gave few details.
   A spokesman for Philips in Eindhoven, Netherlands, called
the discussions preliminary and noted that his company has
contacts with many other potential partners as well. He
refused to say which operations were under discussion.

   A spokeswoman for Olivetti, based in Ivrea, Italy, said
the talks involved "printers and electronic components." She
said the discussions were part of "a stage of diffused
negotiations with a number of European companies for other
possibilities of collaboration." Olivetti added that no
exchanges of shares between the companies were foreseen.
   Some analysts said Philips and Olivetti might be
discussing cooperation in small computer systems. Philips has
long said it was looking at possible partners for its
computer operations, and Chairman Cornelis van der Klugt
hinted last month that the company might have an announcement
on the matter soon.
   Philips reported in March that the computer operations had
heavy losses in 1989, but it didn't quantify them.
