   The board of UAL Corp. meets today to consider a new
higher union bid for United Airlines valued at more than $200
a share, or $4.36 billion, in what could be the last chance
to stave off the start of hostilities in a proxy fight.
   Although some directors seemed inclined to approve the
labor bid, that outcome wasn't a foregone conclusion because
of stiff opposition expected from UAL Chairman Stephen M.
Wolf at today's meeting.

   "There could be open warfare on the board," said one
person familiar with the situation. The board was due to meet
at 10:30 a.m. CDT in Chicago, UAL's headquarters city.
However, it was understood that the board's lawyers were
prepared to tell directors that there would be no legal
problem in accepting the bid.
   The group of United pilots, mechanics and flight
attendants boosted the value of its previous offer of roughly
$4 billion, or $185 a share, for a 75% stake in the airline
by adding a proposed sale of United's 50% stake in its Covia
computer reservation system.
   Some people involved with the revised bid said it could be
valued at $200 to $210 a share, or $4.36 billion to $4.58
billion, enough to meet what was believed to be the board's
minimum acceptable price of $200.
   UAL's stock rose $1.75 to $166.50 a share in composite
trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   If the board rejects the revised offer, Coniston Partners,
UAL's largest shareholder with an 11.8% stake, is poised to
begin campaigning for votes to oust the directors at UAL's
annual meeting April 26. Coniston is supporting the union
buy-out effort.
   The biggest stumbling block to the board's acceptance of
the bid was said to be opposition by Mr. Wolf and directors
loyal to him. Mr. Wolf faces the likely loss of his job if
the union group can complete the acquisition. The unions have
already begun interviewing other executives as possible
replacements for Mr. Wolf, who bore the brunt of the blame
for the collapse of an earlier labor-management buy-out
effort.
   Mr. Wolf is understood to be questioning the value of
concessions the unions have promised to make to help obtain
financing for the current offer. Those concessions are said
to start at $300 million annually, with a cumulative value of
$2 billion over five years. Mr. Wolf has also criticized the
way the unions have treated the company's non-union employees
in the proposal.
   The previous union offer would give UAL shareholders $150
a share in cash, $25 a share in 15% ten-year notes, and an
equity stake in the company totaling 25%. Analysts valued
that offer at $180 to $190 a share.
   Sources confirmed a report in Investor's Daily that the
new offer incorporates the proceeds from the 50% Covia stake,
valued at $500 million or more. The directors had threatened
to try to compete with the earlier union bid by selling such
assets as Covia and paying shareholders a special dividend.
   If the board approves the offer, that could begin to bring
an end to a prolonged period of uncertainty that has gripped
the nation's second largest airline ever since the collapse
last October of a $6.79 billion, $300-a-share
labor-management bid.
   Coniston, which is supporting the union effort to acquire
the company, stepped into the picture by buying stock in the
wake of the bid's collapse after the UAL board said it wanted
the airline to remain independent. Coniston has been waging a
slow-moving campaign to reassemble a transaction ever since.
   The new proposal still faces significant uncertainties,
chiefly whether banks will be willing to make loans for an
acquisition controlled by an unwieldy trio of unions that
hasn't yet identified the executives it plans to install to
manage the airline.
   Because the unions lack the backing of an equity investor
with substantial financial resources, bankers might
reasonably wonder how they could get the unions to make
necessary changes, including pay cuts or layoffs, if the
airline encountered financial setbacks.
