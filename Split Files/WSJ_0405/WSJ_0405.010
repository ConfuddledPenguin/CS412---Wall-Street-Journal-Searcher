   Your March 21 page-one article "Amazon Tragedy: White
Man's Malaria and Pollution Imperil Remote Tribe in Brazil"
on the Yanomami tribe in Brazil stirred up lively discussion
in my classroom. According to the noted anthropologist Marvin
Harris, the Yanomami have been nicknamed "The Fierce People"
because they practice wife-beating and female infanticide.
Quoting from his book "Cannibals and Kings": "They practice
an especially brutal form of male supremacy involving
polygyny, frequent wife beating, and gang rape of captured
enemy women." Furthermore, it is acceptable behavior for a
Yanomami male to trade his wife for food and protection. When
the population experiences a shortage of women for
childbearing, it is equally acceptable to raid other tribes
for them.
   Our question is: Does such a society deserve protection
from the 20th century? Or to put it another way: Are the gold
seekers really the "bad guys" in this story as the article
suggests?

   Perhaps it is the anthropologists who have the most to
gain by preserving such a brutal, primitive culture. They
depend upon such groups for their research grants. I don't
think the Yanomami women enjoy being beaten, raped and traded
like objects. In fact, the article stated that the Yanomami,
in general, crave the technology the white man is bringing.
What's wrong with letting them have it?

   Your article is a sensationalistic, unjust and strongly
racist presentation of a sad situation. Way before the first
Europeans, Asians, Arabs and Hebrews used and abused
alcoholic drinks.
   Millions of years before Hubert Humphrey or the French
Revolution thought to invent equal opportunity, the malaria
virus already practiced it, and it still does.
   The "garimpeiros" (many are not white but blacks and
mulattoes) do nothing that the Anglo- and French-Americans
did not do in North America and Canada.
