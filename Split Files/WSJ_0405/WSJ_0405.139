   Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. said a subsidiary acquired
options on a 5.9% stake of Carburos Metalicos S.A., which, if
exercised, would boost Air Products' share of the Spanish
industrial gas and metal concern to about 30%.
   The Allentown, Pa., company said that the cost and
exercise price of the options, which are exercisable over the
next four years, would involve a transaction of about $75
million at current exchange rates. Air Products received
immediate voting rights for the optioned shares.

   An Air Products spokesman said the options agreement is
part of the company's strategic expansion in Europe.
   In connection with the agreement, Ron Sullam, a vice
president with Air Products Europe, was named senior vice
chairman of Carburos Metalicos. Two more Air Products
representatives are expected to be added to the Spanish
concern's board, bringing Air Products' representation to
four members.
