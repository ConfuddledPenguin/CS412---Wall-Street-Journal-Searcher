   BURLINGTON, Ontario -- Laidlaw Inc. said it has agreed to
sell its Byers Transport Ltd. unit to Herb Assman, president
of Northern Interior FastFrate Ltd. of Prince George, British
Columbia, for $19 million.
   A Laidlaw spokeswoman said Byers no longer fits in with
the company's core businesses of waste management and
passenger transport.
