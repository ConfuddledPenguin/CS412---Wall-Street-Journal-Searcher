   NEW YORK -- Stocks never recovered from a brief period of
panic selling yesterday afternoon as rumors spread that a
major Japanese financial institution might be in trouble.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 17.34 to 2719.37.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 159,540,000
shares compared with 154,310,000 on Tuesday, with much of the
increase in two large blocks of Woolworth and Avon Products.
Declining issues on the Big Board outpaced advancers 918 to
596.

   Stocks tumbled from near unchanged levels in afternoon
trading as talk that a Japanese institution was having
financial problems spread through the market. Stock-index
arbitrage sell programs also kicked in, helping push the Dow
industrials to a loss of more than 20 points.
   Credit concerns were a preoccupation for the U.S. stock
market. Investors fled from savings and loan, bank and other
financial shares.
   A trader at a major Japanese brokerage house said the
rumors about securities firms in the Far East were unfounded.
Still, many traders expected to find the Tokyo stock market
sharply lower this morning. In Chicago, the June S&amp;P futures
contract closed below what traders call "fair value," setting
up the possibility for sell programs on the opening this
morning, one analyst said. In stock-index arbitrage, traders
buy and sell stocks and offset the position in futures to
lock in profits.
   "You can't help wondering at what point Tokyo is going to
affect us," said James Awad, president of BMI Capital, a
money management concern. With expectations of bad
first-quarter earnings reports, and the market's rise on low
volume and narrow breadth for the past few weeks, "it's easy
to see how the New York market could go down in sympathy with
Japan," Mr. Awad said.
   Skittishness about the outlook for Tokyo stock prices made
for sharp gains and active trading in the four issues of put
warrants on the Nikkei Index traded on the American Stock
Exchange. The warrants allow their holders to profit from a
fall in Japanese stocks.
   Salomon's put warrants expiring in January 1993 were the
most briskly traded, with more than 1.9 million changing
hands. The warrants jumped 2 to 12 3/8, an increase of 19.3%.
   Each of the other three put-warrant issues rose at least
15%: Salomon's February 1993 warrants gained 1 7/8 to 13 on
volume of 1.2 million; Denmark's warrants advanced 2 1/8 to
13 3/8 on volume of 1.5 million; and Bankers Trust's warrants
surged 3 3/4 to 28 3/4 with about 773,000 trading.
   But a new issue of Nikkei call warrants, which permit
holders to benefit from a rise in Tokyo stock prices, topped
the list of most actively traded Amex issues. Salomon sold
6.5 million of the warrants at $2.99 each; they closed at 3
1/8, down 1/4 from their opening trade, on volume of 2.9
million.
   TCBY Enterprises fell 1 5/8 to 19 7/8. McDonald's plan to
start selling low-fat frozen yogurt pressured the stock.
"People are nervous that the competition is increasing," said
Caroline Levy, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. But she
added that McDonald's could introduce more consumers to
frozen yogurt. "I don't think TCBY will lose customers to
McDonald's," she said. "McDonald's will create customers for
TCBY."
   Woolworth was second on the Big Board's list of most
active issues because of the large block totaling three
million common shares, or about 4.7% of its shares
outstanding, which changed hands at 61 3/4. The stock skidded
2 to 61 1/2 on 3.4 million shares. Investor Meshulam Riklis
was rumored to be the seller; he couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Another three million-share block trade proved favorable
for Avon, which was most active and rose 1 1/4 to 35 1/4 on
3.5 million shares. The block, amounting to a 5.3% stake, was
traded at an above-market price of 36.
   Baxter International slid 1/4 to 24 3/8 as 2.2 million
shares changed hands. The company disclosed plans for a
restructuring, including a reduction of about 10% in its work
force, and said it will consider spinning off a minority
stake in its diagnostic products business.
   Delta Air Lines dropped 1 1/2 to 72 3/8 after telling
analysts it expects earnings for the quarter ended in March
to be much lower than a year ago. The company didn't give a
specific estimate.
   Other airline stocks also lost ground; AMR, the parent of
American Airlines, declined 1 1/4 to 64 and USAir Group eased
3/8 to 29 5/8. But UAL, parent of United Airlines, which is
the target of a buy-out offer from a group of unions, gained
1 3/4 to 166 1/2.
   Toys "R" Us rose 3/8 to 41 3/4 and traded as high as 42
7/8. Smith Barney, Harris Upham repeated a buy recommendation
on the stock and said it expects the retailer to report a 10%
sales increase in the first quarter for stores open at least
a year.
   Stanley Works skidded 2 1/8 to 34 1/2 following its
estimate that first-quarter net income was 5% to 10% lower
than a year ago, when it posted net of 57 cents a share.
   MNC Financial fell 1 to 17. Merrill Lynch lowered its
short-term investment rating on the stock to "hold" from
"strong buy," based on uncertainty about the quality of the
company's assets and other factors.
   Koger Properties rose 5/8 to 19 1/2. The company said it
plans to buy back as many as one million common shares, or
about 3.7% of its shares outstanding.
   Amre dipped 3/8 to 7 7/8. The company said a management
group that collectively owns about 56% of its common shares
plans to make an offer of $8.75 a share for the rest.
   The Amex Market Value Index fell 0.53 to 361.12. Volume on
the exchange totaled 20,569,600 shares, with 219 issues
advancing and 313 declining.
   Texas Air fell 3/8 to 7. A committee of unsecured
creditors of the company's Eastern Airlines unit, which is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, rejected Eastern's offer
to settle their debts and voted to seek a trustee to run the
airline.
