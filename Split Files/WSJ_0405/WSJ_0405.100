   CHICAGO -- Wheat futures prices leapt amid reports that
Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs owns roughly half of the
wheat stockpile that is available to satisfy futures
contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   But most traders don't think that Mr. Jacobs, who reaped
big profits in the 1980s with astute takeover attempts, wants
to be a heavy hitter in the wheat pit, or any commodity.

   The way Mr. Jacobs describes it he became the owner of
about 800,000 bushels of soft red winter wheat through a
fling that irritated Board of Trade officials and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. About 1.7 million
bushels of wheat are stored in Board of Trade-approved
warehouses in Chicago and Toledo.
   In an interview yesterday Mr. Jacobs said he no longer
holds any wheat futures contracts and hasn't any plans to get
in the market again.
   "I am quite turned off on it," Mr. Jacobs said. "I'd be
better off in Las Vegas."
   In trading yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade, the
wheat contract for May delivery jumped 8.25 cents a bushel to
settle at $3.6975 a bushel.
   The rally was also fanned by speculation that subfreezing
temperatures this weekend might dip into the central U.S.
where winter wheat has emerged from dormancy and is
vulnerable to cold weather.
   Mr. Jacobs's disclosure is highly unusual. Commodity
investors are usually loath to disclose their futures
positions. But Mr. Jacobs is angry at what he said was
pressure by the Board of Trade and federal regulators to
reduce a large position he had in the March wheat contract.
   Mr. Jacobs said he decided to speculate on wheat prices in
February amid widespread reports that two years of drought
had cut the U.S. wheat supply to its tightest level in two
decades.
   Mr. Jacobs, whose only experience with farm commodities
was with oats during the 1988 drought, bought contracts for
delivery in March of three million bushels of soft red winter
wheat -- the maximum position any speculator is allowed to
acquire under Board of Trade rules.
   As the March contract neared expiration, the CFTC and
Board of Trade began putting pressure on him to reduce his
ownership, Mr. Jacobs said. Mr. Jacobs said he ended up
selling contracts covering 2.2 million bushels and taking
delivery of the rest of the wheat.
   A Board of Trade spokesman wouldn't comment and a CFTC
spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
   However, the Board of Trade has taken the position in the
past that it has the power to compel big traders to close out
positions in order to ensure orderly expiration of a
contract.
   Last July, the Board of Trade ordered Italian conglomerate
Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to sell off its soybean holdings
to avert what it saw as possible squeeze attempt.
   The Board of Trade clearly didn't take any formal action
against Mr. Jacobs. Such moves are rare. Board officials
prefer to jawbone traders into reducing large positions in a
contract as it nears expiration in part because they want to
avoid any outward appearance that prices aren't settled
smoothly.
   The problem is that there isn't any widely understood
definition of orderly liquidation. According to wheat
traders, prices might have gyrated if anyone had tried to
take delivery of three million bushels of wheat in March. The
traders who were obligated to deliver the wheat wouldn't have
found enough in convenient locations. The Board of Trade
tries to avoid such a situation for fear traders might
default on their obligations.
   Mr. Jacobs said he wasn't trying to squeeze the wheat
market. There had been rumors for several weeks that someone
might attempt to squeeze the March wheat contract. However,
the March contract is particularly prone to such speculation.
In March, the world supplies of wheat are at the lowest level
before the first crop of the U.S. season begins to be
harvested in late May.
   It isn't clear how Mr. Jacobs fared financially on his
position. He said he made a profit. But traders were
speculating yesterday that he is probably losing money on the
800,000 bushels of wheat he holds and that his disclosure
might help find buyers for it.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Futures prices of crude oil plunged on evidence of
increasing supplies. In early trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for May
delivery broke through the psychologically important level of
$20 a barrel. It then settled at $19.78 a barrel, down 52
cents and near the day's low. The June crude contract
declined 45 cents to $20.18. Oil traders and analysts cited
yesterday's Wall Street Journal article on the continuing
rise in crude production by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries as well as the latest industry statistics
on U.S. oil inventories. The American Petroleum Institute had
reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude oil inventories were up
more than four million barrels at the end of last week.
Traders had expected last week's big drawdown in gasoline
inventories to provide new support for fuel futures. But
unleaded gasoline for May delivery fell 1.02 cents a gallon
to settle at 64.86 cents. The May heating oil contract
dropped 1.48 cents a gallon to 54.02 cents. In other fuels,
natural gas futures were mixed in the second day of trading
of the new contract. The June contract settled at $1.62 a
million British thermal unit, down 1.5 cents.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: For the second time this week futures prices fell
in response to a report that a strike had ended. The May
contract ended with a loss of 4.7 cents a pound at $1.2015,
which was just above the low of the day. On Monday, a wildcat
strike ended at the Highland Valley Mine in Canada.
Yesterday, it was reported from Peru that the 25-day-old
strike by miners and smelter workers of Southern Peru Copper
Corp. had been ended by the union even though it hadn't
reached formal agreement on a new pact with management.
Analysts said that, according to news service reports, the
union took its action because the Peruvian minister of labor
and the union had agreed in principle to an inflation clause
on wages and a 100% wage increase. It wasn't known whether
employees had returned to work or whether they will continue
to work while negotiations between the union and management
continue, analysts said. Southern Peru Copper last year
produced 230,000 tons of refined copper. On that basis, one
metals dealer estimated, the three-week strike caused
production to be reduced by 20,000 tons of copper. Peru is
the world's sixth-largest copper producer.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Silver became the market leader, rising
sharply, while gold and platinum posted more moderate gains.
May delivery silver rose 15.2 cents an ounce to $5.19. June
gold was up $1.70 an ounce at $381.80, and July platinum
advanced $5.20 an ounce to $488.20. Analysts and metals
dealers said there were no fundamental developments to
account for a spurt of demand for silver contracts. They said
May silver was buoyed by demand from computer-guided funds,
which increased their purchases when the price rose above
$5.10. A report circulated that a Japanese financial concern,
perhaps a brokerage company, might have severe credit
problems because of the tumbling Tokyo stock market, analysts
and traders said. But they conceded being at a loss to
explain why this rumor should boost silver prices. James
Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial Management of
Cambridge, Mass., ventured that silver was the precious metal
"in a most bullish position to take advantage of any
development." May silver, he noted, dropped nine cents an
ounce to just below $5 on March 26, in sympathy with gold's
plunge on a reported large gold sale by Saudi Arabia. For the
rest of that week and on Monday of this week silver didn't
fall further but continued to trade around that level. "This
was regarded as a very good performance for silver and
possibly the bottom of a selling pattern that had exhausted
itself," said Mr. Kneafsey. This technical interpretation
apparently attracted demand on Tuesday and the May silver
rose above $5, closing at $5.0380. This move may have been
considered by technically minded traders "as a breakout,"
which in turn stimulated yesterday's buying, he said.
