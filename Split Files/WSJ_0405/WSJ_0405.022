   TORONTO -- Six executives of Film House Group Inc., a
former unit of Cineplex Odeon Corp., launched a suit against
Cineplex for 18 million Canadian dollars (US$15.4 million),
alleging that the theater chain breached its promise to pay
them hefty incentive bonuses.
   The six plaintiffs described the aggregate C$75,000 that
they received as bonuses from Cineplex last December as
"paltry, miserable and lacking in good sense and judgment."

   According to the six executives, Garth Drabinsky, founder
and former chairman of Cineplex, promised "to make you all
rich" if they met or exceeded budgetary performance targets.
   Encouraged by Mr. Drabinsky's promise, the executives say
that they operated the plant seven days a week for 32 weeks
of 1989.
   The Film House executives claim they met or exceeded
budgetary performance levels that had been set for them. They
noted that, as a team, they increased sales to about C$64.5
million in 1989 from C$12.8 million in 1986. They claim that
they operated Film House "at a profit level close to 30% of
sales revenue which is . . . unmatched by any film laboratory
post production house in the world."
   Last week, Rank Organisation PLC completed the purchase of
the 51% of Film House it didn't already own for $40 million.
It had purchased the other 49% in 1988 for for an agreed
price of $73.5 million.
   But Cineplex claims in documents filed with the court that
the Film House executives didn't meet the targets which would
have allowed Cineplex to adjust upward the $73.5 million
price Rank was to pay for Film House. Instead, Cineplex was
obliged to repay between $10.8 million and $12.3 million of
that price.
   The six executives "were paid gratuitously,
notwithstanding that no incentive bonus was earned," Cineplex
said in the court filing.
   A spokeswoman for Cineplex declined further comment,
noting that the issue is before the courts.
   The Film House executives couldn't be reached for comment.
