   Whitehall Corp. said its board will "vigorously oppose" an
effort by Cambridge Capital Fund L.P. to lead a proxy fight
against the company.
   Cambridge, a New York investment company, yesterday
proposed acquiring the 90.4% of Whitehall that it doesn't
already own for $20 a share and said it plans to nominate
five directors to Whitehall's board at the company's annual
shareholders meeting April 23.

   Whitehall said that all its shareholders should be allowed
to "realize the full value of its strategies," which have
left the company debt-free and with more than $10 a share in
cash and equivalents.
   Whitehall's chairman, Lee D. Webster, said in a news
release that the company's board will consider Cambridge's
takeover proposal "in due course."
   Whitehall, based in Dallas, modifies and maintains
aircraft, sells underwater acoustic technology to the U.S.
Navy and makes marine sensor systems.
