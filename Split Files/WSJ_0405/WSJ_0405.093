   NATIONAL MERCANTILE BANCORP. (Los Angeles) -- Terry T.
Tomich resigned as president, chief executive officer and a
director because of "philosophical disagreements" with the
board, the bank holding company said. Mr. Tomich, 49 years
old, had been president and chief executive officer since
December 1982. Howard P. Ladd, the company's 68-year-old
chairman, will serve as interim chief executive until a
permanent successor is named.
