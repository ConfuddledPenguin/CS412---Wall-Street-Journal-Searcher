   KISKUNHALAS, Hungary -- A thin brick wall dividing a big
factory building still separates East from West in this
light-industrial town near Hungary's border with Yugoslavia.
   On one side of the building, two-thirds of state-owned
Texcoop's obsolete knitting machines sit idle for lack of
orders. The rest churn out frumpy 100%-acrylic sweaters for
the Soviet Union. The plant, greasy and gloomy, has lost
money ever since it opened.

   On the other side of the building, a freshly scrubbed,
brightly lit Levi Strauss factory hums to piped-in jazz.
Dozens of women hunch over new American sewing machines and
swiftly affix pockets, sew up inseams and attach zippers.
Little red pennants adorn the machines of those who sew 110%
of their targets; yellow ones indicate 120%. Nearly everybody
has a pennant. The women, all of whom worked for Texcoop
until last year, now earn more than twice as much money.
   The plant was profitable from Day One. Levi earned back
its total investment in less than a year.
   Eastern Europe still has far more factories like Texcoop's
than like Levi's, but every day more ventures bringing
Western management, cash and free-market fervor are being
planned. Not only will they make jeans, light bulbs and
bicycles, but, economists say, the competition they create
will eventually force state companies to either shape up,
sell out or close.
   "These investments are the future of these companies and
the future of Hungary," asserts George Varga, a General
Electric Co. executive who recently took charge of Tungsram
Co., a Hungarian light-bulb maker now controlled by GE.
   The test of this theory is furthest along in Hungary, the
first East bloc country to allow joint ventures on realistic
terms with the West, the first to allow its people to own
private property, the first to establish an embryonic stock
exchange. Free elections, to be completed Sunday, will give
Hungary a legitimate, if fragmented, government dedicated to
the free market, and the country even belongs to the
International Monetary Fund now. "The betting is that Hungary
will write the book on how to make the transition" from a
centrally planned system, says Brian O'Connor, an IBM
executive acting as an adviser to the U.S. Embassy in
Budapest.
   Hungary's main assets are its relative prosperity, its
long ties to the West through Austria, its prewar memory of
competitive pricing and its surviving remnants of a vibrant
capitalist society.
   Although wages are low, food is plentiful; the lines in
Budapest aren't at grocery stores, but at McDonald's, at the
nearby Adidas sporting-goods shop and at Levi's downtown
jeans store. Joint ventures with the West have been legal
here since 1972, though changes in the law didn't make them
attractive until 1988. Politics also began opening up early;
Hungary's decision to scrap its barbed-wire border with
Austria last year led indirectly to the crumbling of the
Berlin Wall.
   But Hungary has major liabilities, too. Among them are a
$20 billion foreign debt, an unstable political structure
(nearly 50 parties ran in the elections, and none will get a
majority) and inflation of 22% a year and rising. Unlike
Poland, the other East Europe country that's out front in
economic reform, Hungary hasn't any well-established
opposition force capable of implementing a tough austerity
program. No political party has the standing or the courage
to advocate scrapping of the state system. So a step-by-step
approach, however unsatisfactory, will continue.
   "People haven't yet seen tangible economic results," says
Zsigmond Jarai, Hungary's deputy finance minister. "There's a
pervasive pessimism, which we must change to optimism. I
don't really understand it; for the first time, we're
completely free to make decisions, and we have real
possibilities."
   Some of those possibilities are unnerving, after 45 years
of a closed system that, however flawed, gave everybody at
least the semblance of a job. More than 90% of Hungary's
economy is state-owned, and, officials estimate, as many as
30% of the employees in state industries are superfluous.
Large-scale privatizing could cause massive unemployment.
Freeing more of the subsidized prices would make inflation
even worse. A rush of foreign investment, with a big dose of
imported machinery, could batter Hungary's balance of
payments and spur further price increases.
   Ferenc Bartha, the president of the National Bank of
Hungary, sees just such a rush, with $350 million of foreign
investment this year and $500 million to $600 million next
year. Though Hungary can absorb such investment only with
difficulty, he sees "a unique historical opportunity for
Hungary to transform our economy. We'd be foolish to miss
it."
   Nonetheless, many Hungarians liken selling off state
companies to selling off the family silver, even though the
estimated $1 billion in foreign investment here so far is
less than 2% of Hungary's total assets. "It'd be bad to sell
out the whole country to foreign capital because there's a
short-term crisis," says Judit Vasarhelyi, who helps run the
Soros Foundation at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
   For instance, the state, which nationalized her uncle's
porcelain factory in 1945, recently sold it to a U.S.
company. "What does reprivatization mean?" she asks. "If it's
national property, shouldn't I have a say in it?" Many
Hungarians were also angered at the sale of a state hotel
group to Swedish interests despite apparently higher bids;
the deal is under review. Fresh controversy erupted this week
when Axel Springer Verlag AG was given control of four
Hungarian newspapers by their managements; the West German
company apparently paid nothing for them.
   Last year, there were 900 joint-venture deals, up from one
in 1981, and officials expect more than 2,000 to be signed
this year. So far, the biggest have involved the U.S.: GE
paid $150 million for 50.1% of Tungsram. General Motors Corp.
says it will invest up to $300 million in a joint venture to
make engines and perhaps vehicles here. Guardian Industries
is spending $110 million in a joint venture to convert an
obsolete glass plant.
   Schwinn Bicycle Co. is making bikes in a joint venture in
a small part of the mammoth Csepel heavy-industry complex
just south of downtown Budapest. Schwinn-Csepel's 450
employees must wear a badge adorned with American and
Hungarian flags; they follow different work rules and earn
25% more than the tens of thousands of state employees all
around them.
   The attractions for foreign investors: Wages are less than
a third of those in the West. Buying more than a 20% equity
stake in a joint venture can exempt the Western company from
taxes for up to five years. Hungarian exports now get
preferential status in both the U.S. and European Community,
and Hungary is a short truck haul from Austria on the west
and Romania on the east. GE will sell its light bulbs here
and in Western Europe. Ralston-Purina Co. will make animal
feed destined for Romania as well as Hungary.
   "The rush {to invest} is motivated by greed and fear,"
says Michel David-Weill, senior partner of Lazard Freres &amp;
Co., which advises the Hungarian government. Greed because
East bloc companies may turn into low-cost producers of
exportable goods, and fear because if they don't buy these
companies, the companies might make the goods themselves and
become formidable competitors.
   What Western companies offer Hungary in technology and
management skill will help it develop a free market. Schwinn
brought in sophisticated painting machines. GE will
computerize Tungsram's hand-kept accounts and may introduce
halogen-lighting technology. It will also introduce
efficiency. Tungsram last year employed 18,000 people to make
and sell $300 million worth of light bulbs; GE's 18,000 U.S.
lighting division employees produced six times as much in
sales.
   A closer look on both sides of the factory wall in
Kiskunhalas affords a glimpse into Hungary's, and Eastern
Europe's, future.
   Texcoop, the state-owned factory, was in trouble right
from the start. The idea of putting a mammoth textile plant
in the middle of farm land came not from market demand but
from a powerful Communist boss who saw political hay in 1,200
new jobs. The target, 2.5 million pullover sweaters a year,
has never been met; in its best year, 1979, Texcoop made 1.7
million.
   "At the start, we were told how much to produce, given so
much yarn, sent all this stuff to Russia, and nobody expected
us to make a profit," Mrs. Gyorgy Olah, the plant director,
says more in sorrow than in anger as she shows a visitor
around.
   She stops by an idle knitting machine. When the plant
opened in 1975, she says, the machines were new, but the work
force inexperienced. By the time the people learned to use
the machines, the equipment was already obsolete. Now it's
hopelessly so. The 15-year-old East German machines aren't
computer-controlled and can't easily be adapted to make
different styles. All they do is churn out white acrylic
sweaters for the Soviets and plain green polo shirts for
French discounters.
   Like most Hungarian state companies, Texcoop was
top-heavy. It has a threestory building that housed the
initial 400-person administrative staff -- 33% of the work
force. Many of these offices were occupied by Communist Party
officials who didn't know a bobbin from a blowtorch. Most of
them are gone, and the building is mostly deserted.
   Texcoop got squeezed, too, by the unrealistic,
now-collapsing East bloc trading system. Even though
Hungarian costs were rising 20% a year, Romania could and did
refuse to pay more for the sweaters because Romanian
inflation was officially zero. The Hungarian government never
invested in new machines because of Texcoop's losses. Mrs.
Olah, hoping to get new equipment, listed Texcoop in the
government's book of state companies seeking foreign partners
-- with no luck.
   More promising are four separate negotiations with Italian
and German companies about leasing portions of the factory
floor. Already, Levi Strauss rents 40% of the plant floor for
25 million forints ($400,000) a year. Selling more of the
plant space would squeeze Texcoop almost out of business, but
Mrs. Olah sees no other choice.
   Production is down to 600,000 sweaters a year and probably
will fall further. Employment is down to 400 and could drop
another 25%. Boxes of Soviet-bound sweaters are piling up in
the hallways because Hungary, tired of being paid in useless
rubles, has temporarily limited its Soviet sales.
   "I'm afraid we don't have much to be proud of," Mrs. Olah
says.
   On the other side of the wall, General Manager Andras
Pinter and Frank Ross, operations director for Levi Strauss
Geneva, which handles Eastern Europe and Africa for the
parent company, bubble with pride. They show off photos of
the rebuilding of their section of the plant. They got the
key in March of 1988 and made the first jeans that September.
   Levi recruited 200 Texcoop workers. In return for a big
pay raise, it asked that they work only for Levi and not hold
down two or three other jobs to make ends meet. Levi's wages
are still low by world standards; a line worker makes about
$250 a month, a manager about $500 a month.
   Today, the workers produce a pair of blue jeans every 10.8
minutes. They were supposed to make 800,000 pair last year;
instead, they made 1.2 million -- and doubled the profit
target. Levi's absentee rate is 6%; Texcoop's is near the
Hungarian average of 25%. Levi's employee turnover in its
first year was 28% -- low for a start-up operation, managers
say.
   "The only real difference between us and Texcoop," says
Mr. Ross, a stocky, genial Scotsman, "is organization."
   Levi gets by with 12 administrators, all of whom have
personal computers. Instead of a Communist official keeping
an eye on the plant, Levi has a personnel officer. Plant
managers post daily production results: Sewing Machine 11 met
108% of its goal, Machine 12 did 106%. Four people were sick,
five on vacation. The Geneva headquarters gets daily computer
printouts. Such controls ensure that huge rolls of imported
denim arrive as needed.
   The cloth is cut on computer-controlled machines, sorted
and given to the eager workers. The women say this is the
main difference between Levi and Texcoop. "There is always
material for us to work on," says one, hunched over a sewing
machine bearing a yellow, 120%-of-production pennant.
"There's no waiting around."
   Not if the women are to produce a pair of jeans every 10.8
minutes. Mr. Ross says this compares favorably with Levi's
other 30 plants world-wide and will come down a few seconds
when a new automatic pocket-sewing machine arrives.
   Mr. Ross says Levi's only problem was to persuade
Hungarian managers to follow its procedures. "They wanted to
help us create the product," he says. "I told them we've
already created it; they just needed to operate everything
properly."
   Mr. Ross contends that the quality equals or tops that of
U.S.-made jeans. Levi prices its jeans much higher in Europe
than in the U.S. and makes more profit here. In Europe, its
image is high-fashion, the American dream. That dream costs a
Hungarian 3,500 forints -- $55, or about two weeks' salary --
for a pair of 501s in Levi's downtown shop. Levi says it
sells jeans here as fast as it can make them.
   "For Hungary, the real gain isn't 200 jobs or a lot of
blue jeans," Mr. Pinter says. "It's the model. Hungarians run
this plant. We can do this."
