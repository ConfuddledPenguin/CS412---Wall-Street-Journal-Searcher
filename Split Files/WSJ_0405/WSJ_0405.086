   NEW YORK -- D. Bruce Peterson, former executive vice
president at SEI Corp., was named chief executive of the new
electronic network planned by six big securities firms to
distribute bond prices and other market information.
   The new joint venture is officially called EJV Partners,
but is also known on Wall Street as the Group of Six. In an
interview yesterday, Mr. Peterson, 43 years old, said the new
network will be available to customers "in about a year."

   Initially, the network, to be distributed on desktop
terminals, will carry only U.S. government-securities prices
and analytical services, Mr. Peterson said. But eventually it
will carry "a wide variety" of securities prices and other
financial information, including research. How much the group
will charge and details of how the information will be
distributed haven't yet been decided.
   The six partners in EJV, which stands for Electronic Joint
Venture, are First Boston Corp., Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., Salomon Brothers Inc., American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. subsidiary and Citibank. The
participation of Citibank, a Citicorp subsidiary, is subject
to regulatory approval.
   Mr. Peterson said "additional firms are expected" to join
later. The six partners already have invested a total of
about $25 million in the joint venture and have agreed to put
in more money as needed.
   Until now, the group has been tight-lipped. But its moves
have been watched on Wall Street because the group could
alter the landscape of the U.S. government-bond market, the
world's largest securities market with average daily trading
volume of more than $100 billion.
   Wall Street's biggest securities firms once held a tight
grip on bond-price information, which gave them a valuable
trading edge. But that has changed in recent years with the
rapid growth of several information companies. Among these
are Telerate Inc., a subsidiary of Dow Jones &amp; Co., which
publishes this newspaper; Reuters Holdings PLC, Bloomberg
Financial Markets, Citicorp's Quotron Systems Inc. and
Knight-Ridder Inc.
   Securities firms "have looked at what's happened to their
own businesses since October 1987, and they've looked at the
success of Reuters, Telerate and Bloomberg, and they've said
maybe the money is in the information business," said Andre
Villeneuve, president of Reuters America Inc. "They're
realizing that information is money."
   Reuters is one of several news organizations that already
have spoken with members of the group about distributing the
group's bond prices. "We've had discussions with individual
members of the Group of Six at a very senior level, and we've
offered to work with them in whatever appropriate way," he
said.
   Many people assumed the obvious candidate to distribute
the new service would be Quotron. But Mr. Peterson emphasized
that "no decision has been made on how we're going to
distribute the data," and that he will be talking to "all the
major companies" in the field before deciding. "There is no
reason why it couldn't be Quotron, but we're going to open
the field to all competitors," he said. He added that more
than one vendor is likely to be selected.
   Mr. Peterson envisions what he calls an "open architecture
concept," allowing other organizations to distribute their
services through the consortium's network. He also said
subscribers would be able to tailor EJV's information to
their own needs.
   Asked how long he expects it will take the group to start
making money, Mr. Peterson replied: "No sooner than three
years down the road to break even." The six partners "view
this as a long-term effort, and I am comfortable both with
their commitment to me and to the venture," he added.
   Mr. Peterson plans to hire about 15 or 20 people to serve
as the nucleus for the new organization. Mr. Peterson said
EJV has a "management board" consisting of Jon S. Corzine, a
partner at Goldman Sachs; John J. Mack, a managing director
at Morgan Stanley; Thomas W. Brock, a managing director at
Salomon Brothers; David A. Jones, chairman of Citicorp
Securities Markets Inc.; Dexter Senft, a managing director at
First Boston; and Stephen P. Gott, an executive vice
president at Shearson Lehman.
   Since 1986, Mr. Peterson has been general manager of the
information services division at SEI, a Wayne, Pa., supplier
of information, financial and evaluation services.
