   The alcoholic beverage industry is in a rage over proposed
legislation requiring health warnings with all ads --
legislation that, if passed, will change the way every beer,
wine and liquor in the country advertises itself.
   As expected, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D., Tenn.) and Rep.
Joseph Kennedy II (D., Mass.) yesterday introduced the
controversial legislation. It calls for health warnings to be
displayed prominently in all alcoholic beverage ads and
promotional materials, much the way cigarette ads must
include the Surgeon General's warning now. But the alcohol
warnings would be even more intrusive than the cigarette
warnings: Not only are they longer, but they would have to be
read aloud, as well as displayed, in all TV ads for wines and
beers.

   Mandatory health warnings would lead to enormous changes
in the way alcohol companies advertise, especially for beer
makers that spend tens of millions of dollars annually on TV
and radio ads. Because the lengthy warnings would have to be
read aloud in ads, they would effectively do away with both
15-second and possibly some 30-second commercials, industry
executives insist. Billboards might also be problematic,
considering that the proposed warnings -- the bill lists five
to be used on a rotating basis -- get longer than 30 words,
not including a mandatory 800-number for information.
   "Advertising has never proven to be the link to alcohol
abuse or underage drinking," contends Richard Klemp, director
of government affairs for Miller Brewing Co., a unit of
Philip Morris Cos. "Having the government mandate messages on
commercials is the wrong approach. It's almost like they want
all the beer commercials to be like Joe Isuzu commercials,
where it says `he's lying.'" Stephen K. Lambright, a vice
president with Anheuser-Busch Co., brands the proposed
measures "ill-timed and misinformed."
   The advertising and liquor industry's fury is hardly
unexpected; the industry screams whenever anyone attempts to
introduce restrictions of any sort. But what makes the
proposed bill stand out is its chance of ultimately becoming
law. Although liquor executives say the proposed legislation
faces an uphill battle this time around, they expect the idea
to resurface down the road.
   "I think it's a matter of sooner or later -- not if," says
a grim Richard Lewis, who heads up the ad account for Absolut
Vodka at TBWA Advertising. "The unfortunate thing is, the
liquor industry is such an easy industry to kick." Mr. Lewis
says that since liquor interests are splintered -- beer
brewers tend to distance themselves from hard liquor
companies -- it doesn't have the kind of cohesive lobbying
clout that the tobacco industry has.
   "I believe it isn't impossible, and not even unlikely, for
liquor advertising to be banned before tobacco advertising,"
he says, "because it's a less well-defended industry."
   Advertising lobbying groups are marshaling their defenses
now; yesterday, fax machines were working overtime as various
companies and industry groups voiced their indignation. All
insist the legislation is unnecessary and misguided. They say
education efforts are a better choice than labeling. They
take issue with the proposals' assertion that children see
100,000 beer commercials by the time they are 18.
Anheuser-Busch's Mr. Lambright says that is a "myth" and
"patently false."
   "Beer is a legitimate, simple pleasure of life," he adds.
"There is no reason for alcohol to take the road followed by
tobacco."
   The legislative attack comes at a time when the alcohol
industry has been losing sales. Total consumption of
alcoholic beverages peaked in 1986, according to M. Schanken
Communications, which publishes Impact, a trade newsletter.
Sales of distilled spirits have been declining since 1979,
while wine has been on a downward tilt since 1984. Beer
hasn't yet peaked, but sales were basically flat in 1989,
according to Impact studies.
   Even as consumption drops, alcohol companies are coming
under further restrictions; since November, they've been
required to display health warnings on their labels. "Aren't
you reducing the credibility of these warning labels as you
begin to apply them everywhere, every which way?" asks Peter
Seremet, vice president of public affiars for Heublein Inc.,
a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC that makes Smirnoff vodka as
well as Inglenook and Almaden wines.
   The proposed legislation follows a sweeping legislative
attack on tobacco, an even more beleaguered industry. At
least six proposed bills are pending that would severely
restrict tobacco advertising, including two that would ban
the use of colors or pictures in promotions, permitting only
all-text ads.
   "When are we going to see warning messages in ads for
cars? And for coffee because it contains caffeine?" fumes
TBWA's Mr. Lewis. "How far do you take this?"
   The alcohol legislation's proponents say the warning
labels are necessary to counter fetal alcohol syndrome and
other alcohol-related problems. The five warnings would have
to be boxed in ads, and include cautions against drinking and
driving, drinking during pregnancy, drinking with other
drugs, addictive drinking and drinking under age 21.
   While some advertising and liquor executives are
optimistic about defeating the proposals, they are
nevertheless fighting to their last breaths. And the battle
shows every indication of getting dirty: Several
alcohol-industry executives suggested that if they're forced
to display warning labels, they might abandon the alcohol
abuse messages they've been funding voluntarily.
   Since the legislation would force beers and wines to use
longer, more expensive spots, so this argument goes, the
alcohol companies will have less money left to spend on
public service ads. "You're going to have to pay far more for
advertising," says Heublein's Mr. Seremet. "Where is the
money going to come from {to create public service ads}? They
didn't think these things out very well."

   Where's the Real Life of Ads?
                                                                                                       

   Consumers complain that advertising doesn't reflect the
complexity and real experiences of American life, a new
consumer study by Grey Advertising concludes.
   The study, called "Households of the 1990s: America's New
Grown-ups," suggests an adult population will emerge that
says time is the most important variable in their lives. This
segment of the population will include 52 million households
and will hold the buying power in the 1990s, Grey predicts.
   These consumers are skeptical of advertising, though. It's
too trendy and doesn't ring true to consumers' personal
experiences, Grey says. "It's time for us to make some
changes," says Barbara Feigin, executive vice president at
Grey.
   Some changes, such as including family members other than
mom in consumer products ads, are already being made, Grey
says. But the agency says many ads insult consumers by
blowing out of perspective a product's place in a consumer's
life.
