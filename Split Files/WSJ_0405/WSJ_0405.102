   Upjohn Co. said it received approval from the United
Kingdom department of health to market Regaine Topical
Solution in the U.K. to women with thinning hair.
   Regaine is called Rogaine in the U.S. and has been sold in
the U.S. as a prescription-only anti-baldness drug for men
since October 1988. Upjohn, of Kalamazoo, Mich., last
September asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
approval to market Rogaine to women in the U.S. and is still
awaiting a decision.

available for men in 63 countries and for women in 20.
