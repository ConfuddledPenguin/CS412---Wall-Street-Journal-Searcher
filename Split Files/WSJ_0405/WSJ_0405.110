   NEW YORK -- There is one place you won't find signs of
Wall Street's recession: in the executive suites of some big
securities firms.
   Three top executives at Morgan Stanley Group Inc. received
24% pay increases with salaries exceeding $5 million last
year, the firm's proxy material shows. Chairman S. Parker
Gilbert, President Richard B. Fisher and Vice Chairman Robert
F. Greenhill all received cash compensation of $5.5 million,
up from $4.4 million in 1988.

   Managing directors Lewis W. Bernard and John J. Mack also
received 16% pay raises in 1989, to $3.7 million, the proxy
material shows.
   At PaineWebber Group Inc., Chairman Donald B. Marron
received a 64% pay raise, to $2.1 million in 1989. Donald E.
Nickelson -- PaineWebber president until his retirement in
January -- and Paul B. Guenther, presidents of an operating
division, both received $1.1 million last year, raises of 39%
and 72%, respectively.
   Morgan and PaineWebber declined comment.
   These two concerns thrived last year as other investment
banks on Wall Street wilted. Morgan, with a 12% rise in
earnings, posted net income of $443 million last year -- the
second highest on Wall Street after Salomon Inc.
PaineWebber's 1989 net income surged 23%, to $52 million.
