   Amre Inc., Dallas, said a management group expects to
propose an acquisition of the shares of the company it
doesn't already own for $8.75 a share, subject to financing
and certain other conditions.
   The company, which markets home-improvement products under
the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. name, said a special committee of
its board had met with the group, which consists of Steven D.
Bedowitze, president; Robert Levin, executive vice president;
and Ronald I. Wagner, senior vice president.

   Collectively, the management group already owns about 56%
of Amre's common stock outstanding, the company said.
   Amre said a special committee of outside directors would
evaluate any offer that is made, but a company spokesman
declined to discuss details or say when an offer might be
expected.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Amre closed
at $7.875, down 37.5 cents.
