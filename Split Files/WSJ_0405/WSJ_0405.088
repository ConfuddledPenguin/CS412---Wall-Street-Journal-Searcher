   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is entering
the service-based voice mail market, using a system it
developed with VoiceCom Systems Inc.
   The network-based phone messaging service, called AT&amp;T
Voice Mail, is a national service that will operate
continuously using AT&amp;T 800 service and touchtone telephones.
Subscribers to the service don't purchase equipment, but
rather pay a monthly service charge and an additional
per-message fee. An installment fee of $10 per mailbox also
will be charged.

   The service allows the user to create, send and receive
voice messages. The telecommunications company is targeting
businesses whose employees travel a lot or whose offices are
spread out.
   Neither of AT&amp;T's two largest long-distance competitors,
MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., a
unit of United Telecommunications Inc., plans to offer such a
service. Telecom USA, Atlanta, the fourth-largest carrier,
has been offering voice mail service since 1988.
   AT&amp;T already operates in the private voice-mail market,
where customers purchase their own equipment. The company
estimates the overall market for subscription-based voice
mail ranged from $175 million to $200 million in 1989.
   The private product-based market, where companies buy
in-house systems, is estimated at about $500 million a year
by Kenneth G. Bosomworth, president of International Resource
Development, a telecommunications consulting firm.
   VoiceCom, based in San Francisco, is a provider of voice
messaging and processing services.
