   WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed the nomination of
Edward Kelley to a new term on the Federal Reserve Board.
   The nomination of Mr. Kelley to a full 14-year term that
began Feb. 1 was approved by a voice vote. A former Houston
businessman, Mr. Kelley is a longtime friend of both
President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker. He rarely
speaks publicly about the economy or Fed policy and isn't
thought to have a strong influence on monetary policy.

   Before joining the Fed board in 1987, Mr. Kelley, 57 years
old, was chairman of Investment Advisors Inc., a Houston
money manager. He is a graduate of Rice University and
received a master's degree in business administration from
Harvard University.
