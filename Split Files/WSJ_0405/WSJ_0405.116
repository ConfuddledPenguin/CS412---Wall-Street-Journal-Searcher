   DALLAS -- In a survey that underscores the real estate
crisis in Texas, the Finance Commission of Texas found that
banks, thrifts and the federal government control $43.55
billion of Texas real estate that has been repossessed or
will be shortly.
   "It's a frightening number," said commission Chairman R.
Dary Stone, president of Delphinance Development Corp. of
Dallas.

   About 45% of the property covered by the survey is raw
land, a circumstance that doesn't bode well for Resolution
Trust Corp. or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as they
attempt to market the repossessed assets of thrifts and
banks.
   "There's just not a market for land," Mr. Stone said.
"That's why the FDIC's and RTC's job is so difficult. They're
going to be here for a long time."
   And the size of the problem could be as much as 50%
larger, Mr. Stone suggested, because the survey -- released
yesterday -- didn't include nonperforming loans or real
estate controlled by out-of-state thrifts and banks.
   Land accounted for about $19.43 billion of the real estate
covered by the survey. Retail, office and industrial
properties, whose market is recovering in some parts of
Texas, accounted for about $11.47 billion of the portfolio.
Multifamily developments, including apartment complexes,
which are selling well in most parts of Texas, made up about
$7.47 billion of the total.
   The survey covers real estate and nonperforming loans held
by thrifts, banks and the government as of June 30, 1989. Mr.
Stone said he doesn't expect that the $43.55 billion value
will have changed much in intervening months.
