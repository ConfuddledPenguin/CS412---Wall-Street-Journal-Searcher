   SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp.'s Bank of America
subsidiary said it was awarded a contract from Severn River
Crossing Ltd. to arrange $865 million for a bridge project in
the U.K.
   Bank of America said it is lead underwriter for the
financing, which involves bank debt jointly underwritten by
Lloyds Bank PLC of Britain and Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole of France. Proceeds will be used to construct a
second bridge across the Severn river, and to refinance
current debt on the existing bridge. The new bridge will link
Avon in the west of England to Gwent in Wales, and will
become part of Britain's M4 motorway.

   Severn River Crossing was established to hold a 30-year
concession to design and build the new bridge, and operate it
along with the new bridge.
