   WASHINGTON -- Congressional budget-cutters have begun
looking for ways to scale back spending by the three military
academies and reduce the number of college students enrolled
in officer-training classes nationwide.
   Such cost-cutting ideas, aimed at the military's
time-honored way of choosing and training its future leaders,
emerged yesterday during a Senate Armed Services subcommittee
hearing. Once considered to be almost heretical and political
folly by Pentagon supporters, the proposals circulating on
Capitol Hill show how far the debate over defense spending
has shifted in recent months.

   "We know that current demand for new officers is less than
was forecast four or five years ago," said subcommittee
chairman Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), adding that heftier
troop cuts are inevitable by the mid-1990s. Budget pressures
require the Pentagon to "improve the efficiency as well as
the academic vitality of the academies," Sen. Glenn said,
noting that Congress has an obligation to carefully review
how the institutions manage those changes.
   Budget cuts involving the academies are still preliminary,
and the details won't become clear until the Pentagon
completes its own personnel review later this year. But
members of the subcommittee, conducting their first detailed
oversight hearing on the subject in more than a decade,
grilled the superintendent of each of the service academies
about everything from maintenance and training costs to
faculty-student ratios.
   "We're going to have to do something about {newly
commissioned} officers coming through the system as though
nothing has changed" in East-West relations, said Sen. James
Exon (D., Neb.), usually a strong supporter of the Pentagon.
   So far, the military has avoided committing itself to
major changes. "There are no sacred cows" in the effort to
cut costs, Christopher Jehn, the Pentagon's top personnel
official, assured lawmakers.
   But other witnesses acknowledged that current Pentagon
plans envision that the size of the class entering each of
the three service academies -- West Point, Annapolis and the
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs -- will remain
basically flat this fall. As a result, the largest and most
immediate cuts in new officers are expected to come from the
850 or so colleges and universities that offer
officer-training programs.
   Whatever the outcome, lawmakers are certain to think hard
about making changes in programs that for decades have been
among the most popular and jealously guarded portions of the
defense budget. Sen. Glenn, who clearly used the hearing to
send an early-warning signal to the military bureaucracy,
nevertheless assured the witnesses that his goal was to
impose tighter financial controls on the academies rather
"than to close them down or to reduce their role as the
bedrock source of military officers."
   Increased congressional scrutiny, however, already has
embarrassed the academies. A General Accounting Office report
released by the subcommittee concluded that the Pentagon may
have tried to hide millions of dollars paid to run the
facilities, while failing to adequately audit and supervise
their financial affairs.
