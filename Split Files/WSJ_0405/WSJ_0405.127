   NEW YORK -- Bond prices surged yesterday in reaction to
rumors of a growing credit crunch in Japan. Dealers said the
trading activity was the most hectic so far this year.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which barely budged
in early trading, suddenly shot up in midafternoon as
investors rushed to buy bonds. The benchmark bond ended more
than one point higher, a gain of about $10 for each $1,000
face amount. The bond had been as many as 1 3/4 points higher
but edged lower on profit-taking.

   The rally was triggered by rumors that a small Japanese
brokerage firm is about to collapse. There also was talk that
a large institutional investor couldn't meet margin calls and
that a major real estate developer defaulted on bank loans.
   The rumors, which couldn't be confirmed, prompted buying
of Treasury bonds on the belief that the reports will lead to
a rout in Japan's stock market. That, in turn, would
encourage Japanese investors to sell stocks and buy U.S.
Treasury bonds, fueling a "flight-to-quality" rally. When
investors become nervous, they sometimes sell stocks or
corporate bonds and buy U.S. Treasury securities, which are
considered the safest investment in the world.
   That scenario may sound convoluted, but traders said many
investors followed that line of reasoning yesterday.
   Robert B. Sbarra, a senior vice president and trading
manager at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc., said the rally
began in the futures pit. "The stops were set off in the
short end and rippled all along the curve," he said.
   As prices rose, some dealers and traders rushed to buy
bonds in an effort to cover their short sale positions. In a
shortsale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to
make a profit by buying the securities back at a lower price.
That strategy backfired yesterday, and investors were forced
to buy at higher prices instead.
   One trader characterized the scramble for Treasurys as
"kamikaze trading," and said he viewed the speculative
trading as being "way overdone."
   Also supportive to U.S. Treasurys, although at far lesser
degree, were comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan. He told Congress that the U.S. may attract
disproportionate capital inflows as investors around the
world seek to diversify risk.
   Bond market analysts said market participants were
heartened by those remarks because they suggested that
foreign investors will remain major participants in the U.S.
bond market.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Resolution Funding Corp. plans to sell $3.5 billion
40-year bonds Tuesday, the proceeds of which will be used to
finance the bailout of the nation's savings and loan
industry.
   As expected, the size of the auction was smaller than that
of the previous 40-year Refcorp bond auction in January,
which totaled $5 billion. The large size of the previous
offering was viewed as one reason why the auction fared so
poorly. Strong demand was expected, but results were
daunting, and the issue's price quickly plunged in response.
   In when-issued trading activity, the Refcorp 40-year bond
was quoted late yesterday at a yield of 8.82% to 8.83%.
   The Treasury also announced it will sell $7.5 billion of
new seven-year notes on Wednesday. In when-issued trading,
the seven-year notes were quoted at 8.58%.
   In other trading, the benchmark 30-year bond ended at a
price of 99 25/32 to yield 8.51% compared with Tuesday's
price of 98 23/32 to yield 8.61%. The latest 10-year bond
ended at 99 18/32 to yield 8.55% compared with 99 2/32 to
yield 8.62%.
   Short-term rates fell sharply yesterday. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.74% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.98% while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.70% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.10%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   One of the widely held junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. fell
sharply yesterday because, in the terms of Wall Street
traders, the bond went "ex-interest payment."
   That means that bond holders who buy bonds after a certain
date, in this case Tuesday, won't receive accrued interest
payments for the preceding period. Typically, securities
prices move up by the dollar amount of the interest payment
as the ex-interest date approaches, then prices fall by the
amount of the interest payment after the payment date.
   Yesterday, RJR's 13.71% exchangeable pay-in-kind
debentures dropped 3 1/2-points to 64 1/2 after the $4.1
billion issue went "ex-interest payment." The accrued
interest payment on the 13.71% PIK issue was $68.55 per
$1,000 face amount bond.
   A spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange said the
exchange marked down the bonds by 6 7/8 points to a price of
61 1/8 before trading began, so as to reflect the loss of the
accrued interest.
   However, since the interest on the RJR PIK bonds is paid
in the form of additional bonds rather than in cash, the
bonds rose during trading to reflect what market participants
believe is the value of the interest payment when paid in
bonds.
   The other RJR PIK issue, the 13.71% convertible debentures
maturing in 2009, advanced 7/8 point to 77 7/8.
   Other junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, were mixed. A
sell-off in the stock market pulled distressed junk bond
prices lower, but market participants said better quality
issues were generally unchanged to slightly firmer.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   A strengthening U.S. Treasury market pulled tax-exempts
higher, with municipal bonds trading as much as 1/4 point
higher.
   While municipals didn't post the gains seen by government
securities, the spurt of trading activity did carry over,
traders said.
   Some market participants also saw the increase in activity
as an opportunity to sell some bonds, several traders said.
   Among seasoned dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority
7.20% securities of 2018 were up 1/4 point at 97 3/8 to 97
5/8 to yield 7.40%, which was .02 percentage point lower than
yields quoted late Tuesday.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, rose on increased
retail buying and a firm pound.
   Among benchmarks, the 11 3/4% gilt due 2003-2007 rose
19/32 to 99 1/4 to yield 11.85%, while the 12% gilt due 1995
was up 10/32 to 97 6/32 to yield 12.78%.
   Traders said some institutions took advantage of the lull
in the market to boost portfolio holdings.
   In Japan, government bonds ended slightly weaker. Dealers
said trading activity was limited by the prospect that the
government will auction 10-year government bonds today.
   The monthly auction for 10-year government bonds isn't
scheduled for today but is likely to be held if parliament
can pass the temporary budget for the new fiscal year, which
began Sunday.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the yield on the
benchmark No. 119 issue due 1999 was 7.3%. The price was down
0.19, at 86.25.
   West German bonds ended little changed in quiet trading.

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities were higher, but they
lagged the performance in the Treasury market.
   Government National Mortgage Associations 9% securities
for April delivery were quoted at 96 2/32, up 7/32, to yield
about 9.71%.
   The spread between Ginnie Mae 9% securities and the
10-year Treasury note widened to 1.16 percentage points from
about 1.13 percentage points late Wednesday.
   Federal National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
were at 98 15/32, up 7/32.
