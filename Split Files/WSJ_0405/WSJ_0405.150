   DETROIT -- In a huge settlement likely to add impetus to
the debate over the safety of lap-only rear seat belts, Ford
Motor Co. agreed to pay $6 million to settle a
personal-injury lawsuit.
   The issue of lap-only belts has been emerging for several
years as a major product-liability problem for auto makers,
and other companies have paid multimillion-dollar settlements
in several instances. But yesterday's settlement between Ford
and a California family appears to be one of the largest
payments in such a case.

   The suit charged the company with negligence for putting
lap-only belts -- instead of "three-point" lap-and-shoulder
belts -- in the rear seats of Ford's Escort model cars built
before this year. The suit claimed that Ford knew that the
belts wouldn't adequately protect rear passengers, but didn't
want to spend the extra money to install three-point belts.
Ford contends that expense wasn't an issue, but that the
benefit of three-point belts for rear passengers wasn't clear
at the time.
   Some 140 million cars were sold in the U.S. with lap-only
rear belts before December 1989, when the government made
three-point belts mandatory in rear seats and encouraged auto
makers to retrofit earlier models. Auto makers have been hit
with many suits charging that deaths or injuries could have
been prevented by the three-point belts, which include a
shoulder harness in addition to a lap belt.
   "There is a flood" of similar cases, said Benjamin Kelley
of the Institute for Injury Reduction, a Maryland-based
organization founded by trial attorneys to gather and
distribute information about product-safety cases. The rear
lap belt issue will be "one of the biggest sources of
automotive litigation in history," Mr. Kelley contends.
   A Ford attorney acknowledged that such suits are a growing
problem for the auto industry. "This isn't just a Ford
issue," said Richard Molloy, a Ford associate general
counsel. "This is a seat-belt issue that affects all
manufacturers." Ford has settled about a dozen similar cases
involving the Escort model, Mr. Molloy said, and has another
four pending.
   The California settlement stems from a San Diego County
accident in November 1988 in which 11-year-old James Miller
was killed and his twin brother, Richard, was left a
paraplegic. Both boys were passengers in a Ford Escort and
wore the standard lap-only rear belts. Their parents sat in
the front seats, wearing lap-and-shoulder belts.
   "The front end of the Escort was virtually demolished, yet
the shoulder-harnessed parents escaped with relatively minor
injuries," the Miller family said in a prepared statement
yesterday. "The rear half of the vehicle was left completely
intact, yet one child died and the other was paralyzed."
   Ford, in a statement, expressed its sympathy with the
Miller family, but contended it wasn't at fault. "There was
nothing about the Escort that caused the accident," the
company said, "or contributed to or enhanced the injuries of
the occupants. The settlement will make reasonable provision
for the needs of the family, and spare the parties the
substantial costs and uncertainties of litigation."
   Mr. Molloy said Ford agreed to the settlement because of
"the possibility that the very human elements of this
tragedy" might cause a jury to issue a verdict against Ford.
   The suits against car makers on rear lap belts involve two
different issues. One is the allegation that auto makers have
known for some time that three-point belts offered better
protection than lap belts. The other charge is that in some
cases, wearing the lap belt was worse than wearing no belt at
all, because lap-only belts could cause abdominal injuries.
   General Motors Corp. recently settled a Philadelphia case
for an undisclosed amount of money in which John McKenna, 26,
was killed while wearing a lap belt in the rear seat of a
Pontiac Trans Am, according to Larry E. Coben, an attorney
representing the family. Mr. McKenna's wife, who was sitting
next to him in the back of the car without her belt on,
received no injuries.
   "If he (McKenna) had no belt on, he would have walked
away," according to Mr. Coben.
   It isn't clear how many lap-belt cases are pending, but
estimates by trial lawyers range as high as 500. Mr. Kelley
predicts that the number of such lawsuits could climb to
1,200 a year.
   In many cases, the amounts of the settlements in the
seat-belt cases aren't disclosed, at the insistence of the
auto makers. Nevertheless, in recent years, some top-dollar
settlements have been made public.
   General Motors in September 1986 paid $5 million to settle
a rear lap-belt lawsuit, though the company said it didn't
believe the car had any defect. Honda Motor Co. agreed a few
years ago to settle another case for $2 million.
   In December 1987, in one of cases that went to trial, a
federal jury in Baltimore awarded $3.3 million to the family
of James Garrett, then 13, who was partially paralyzed while
riding in a Ford Escort that collided with a dump truck.
Besides citing the lack of a rear shoulder harness in the
Escort in which the Garrett boy was riding, the jury found
that the design of the Escort's lap belt was defective.
   Ford could have avoided the whole problem by adding rear
shoulder harnesses to the Escort for a mere $12 a belt,
according to Craig McClellan, the attorney for the Miller
family. A Ford spokesman said that while that amount would
have covered the cost of the belt alone, other costs were
involved.
   The company said it would have cost $20 to $25 in
materials for each belt and the hardware necessary to install
it on the assembly line. In addition, Ford also spent
approximately $12 million last year on engineering and
retooling changes to install the shoulder-harness belts on
four models, the Ford spokesman said.
   Also last year, Ford made available to dealers three-point
belt kits to retrofit the rear seats of Escorts. Ford
suggests that dealers charge $50 a belt plus one to two hours
of labor, bringing the total cost of each retrofit belt to
perhaps $100.
