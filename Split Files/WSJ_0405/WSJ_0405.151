   BFS Bankorp Inc. backed a plan under which Fredric H.
Gould, Gould Investors L.P. and BRT Realty Trust would seek
clearance to boost their stake in the thrift to as much as
24.9% from 9.9%.
   BFS also agreed to expand its board to six members from
five, to add Mr. Gould, who is chairman of BRT and a general
partner of Gould Investors.

   Also, James A. Randall, president and chief executive
officer of BFS, said the holding company for Bankers Federal
Savings expects to settle its litigation with First Capital
Group Inc. shortly.
   First Capital had proposed to pay $16 a share, or $23
million, for BFS, which rejected the bid as inadequate. The
Redondo Beach, Calif., investment firm waged a proxy fight,
and one of its executives was named to BFS's board. BFS filed
suit to block First Capital from making any offer and to void
any proxies that First Capital solicited.
   A spokesman for First Capital was unavailable for comment.
