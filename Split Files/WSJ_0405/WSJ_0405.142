   WILMINGTON, Del. -- A lawyer defended Occidental Petroleum
Corp.'s planned outlays of $95 million for a museum to house
Chairman Armand Hammer's art collection as akin to the
purchase of the Louisiana territories and Alaska.
   William Prickett told the Court of Chancery in Delaware
that for "pennies per share," Occidental shareholders are
contributing to "a national treasure."

   Mr. Prickett, a leading lawyer for a group of plaintiffs
proposing settlement of class-action suits with Occidental
over the museum plans, urged the court to approve the pact as
best for Occidental stockholders, the company and the public.
Occidental, based in Los Angeles, has interests in oil,
pipelines, chemicals, and meat packing.
   The settlement calls for, among other things, a $60
million cap on direct costs of the museum, provides for
outlays for museum support and sets a limit on future
Occidental donations to Hammer-related charities. It also
includes $1.4 million in fees plus expenses for plaintiffs'
lawyers involved in the pact, which was reached by one set of
litigants in the case but which is opposed by others.
   Mr. Prickett, who has in the past defended the much noted
proposed legal fees, backed away from the figure yesterday,
asserting that whatever amount is set by Vice Chancellor
Maurice Hartnett in the case will be acceptable.
   Opposing the proposed settlement, Susan E. Henricksen, a
California deputy attorney general, called the museum "a
waste of assets" that amounts to "a gift to Dr. Hammer." Ms.
Henricksen, appearing on behalf of the state's public pension
funds, which hold about two million shares of Occidental,
argued that the size of Occidental's outlays is so enormous
"as to raise reasonable doubt as to whether it is entitled to
protection" under a standard of Delaware jurisprudence known
as the "business judgment" rule, which protects certain
decisions by corporate managements and directors.
   Occidental has argued that a special committee of outside
directors approved the plan, removing it from assertions that
Dr. Hammer caused corporate funds to be spent for his
benefit.
   Vice Chancellor Hartnett reserved decision on the proposed
settlement.
   The museum, currently under construction in the Los
Angeles suburb of Westwood, is scheduled to open in November,
with a retrospective exhibit of the works of Soviet painter
Kasimir Malevich.
