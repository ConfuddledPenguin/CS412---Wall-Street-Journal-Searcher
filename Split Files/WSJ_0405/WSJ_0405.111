   Casual Male Corp., citing a troubled menswear retail
market, said it filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Earlier, Casual Male reported that efforts to sell the
Shrewsbury, Mass., company hadn't been successful and that it
will probably report a loss of more than $6 million for its
fiscal year ended Jan. 27.

   The clothing retailer said that "significant" competition
from discount retailers and costs associated with an
aggressive store-expansion program were the principal factors
contributing to its problems. Casual Male opened more than
100 stores last year and currently operates more than 335
units.
   In January, Casual Male said it arranged a $14.5 million
credit facility with Shawmut National Bank that is secured by
inventory and equipment. Last month, the company also
arranged for an unsecured loan of $2.3 million from certain
major stockholders.
   Casual Male will continue to operate under court
protection from creditors while it restructures and
reorganizes.
