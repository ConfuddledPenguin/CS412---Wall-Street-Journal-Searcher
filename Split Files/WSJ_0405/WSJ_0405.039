   SEOUL, South Korea -- The government unveiled yet another
plan to stimulate the Korean economy, but one that analysts
say could boost exports and thereby trigger trade friction
and inflation.
   The government's new team of economic ministers, installed
after a cabinet shake-up late last month, wants South Korea
to once again emphasize exports as an engine for economic
growth. To be sure, the government says it won't revert to an
export-at-any-cost policy.

   "There will be no return to the past, overzealous export
drive," Deputy Prime Minister Lee Seung Yun said. Indeed, the
plan is modest: Among other things, the government will
double an existing $1.4 billion fund for long-term,
low-interest loans to stimulate export industries.
   The Japan-like export-growth prescription that was
followed by South Korea in the late 1970s and 1980s produced
a period of rapid growth. But the reformist team of economic
ministers ousted from the cabinet last month had advocated
paying more attention to social inequities that are fueling
discontent. That was unpopular with Korea's big business
conglomerates, and the cabinet shake-up was seen as a way for
the government's ruling party to appease the companies.
   Under the former cabinet's policies, South Korea's trade
surplus fell to $900 million in 1989 from $9 billion the year
before. Exports to the U.S. dropped 4.2% last year.
   But the flagging economy and the new drive to push exports
could exacerbate trade tensions with the U.S. The Korean
government is also trying to limit imports of consumer
products and, because of the tough times, the large companies
that dominate South Korea's economy are less likely to make
concessions to open the country's markets, as the U.S. has
demanded.
   The deputy prime minister also said that the South Korean
currency will "be adjusted to a more realistic level." The
won's exchange rate reflects market forces and can be
adjusted to fit government policy, in this case to promote
exports. Thus analysts expect the won to continue to fall
against the dollar, despite inflation fears. The rate now
stands at about 700 won to the dollar, down from about 670
this past summer.
   With or without the plan, many analysts expect the economy
to get better. Experts say the export-dependent economy
touched bottom recently and will be showing improvement this
summer as export volume resumes growth after a flat 1989.
   Yesterday's announcement blamed the economy's slide on
declining exports, which in turn were blamed on sharp wage
increases and the appreciation of the won. A strengthening
won forces Korean manufacturers to raise prices in the U.S.
or reduce profit margins.
   But many economists blame South Korea's economic problems
on its lack of product innovation more than higher prices
overseas. South Korea's big companies usually tag along after
the Japanese and haven't come up with innovative products.
The new policy mentions this problem, but offers no quick
solutions.
   "Korea has bumped up against its technological limits,"
said Henry Morris, chief representative of Kleinwort Benson
Ltd. in Seoul. "It is a problem that hasn't been seriously
addressed in Korea."
