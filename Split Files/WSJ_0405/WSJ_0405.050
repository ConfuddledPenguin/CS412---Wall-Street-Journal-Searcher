   When Firms Cut Out Middle Managers,
   Those at Top and Bottom Often Suffer

   Organizational charts in American companies are becoming
as flat as pancakes.
   Streamlined bureaucracies may translate into higher
profits, more responsive customer service and faster product
development, but they are also forcing difficult adjustments
in how managers work. Many managers must adapt to fuzzier
lines of authority and greater emphasis on teamwork.
Low-level managers accustomed to carrying out orders suddenly
are asked to set strategy. For most, a leaner structure means
not only increased workloads but also diminished chances for
promotion, and the frustration that fosters.

   "The life of a manager is a lot more difficult now than 10
years ago," says Robert Kelley, a business professor at
Carnegie Mellon University. "As companies cut layers, they
haven't also cut the work, so managers are getting stretched
very thin overseeing more people and jobs."
   The old hierarchical corporation, with a pyramid-shaped
management structure, allowed managers to carefully sift
information before making decisions -- but they decided too
slowly. In today's global marketplace, what counts is speed.
Companies must be able to launch new products quickly and
alter existing ones for big customers. The only solution is
flatter companies in which information flows quickly from top
to bottom and back again, decisions come fast and teamwork is
the rule.
   Managers who survive a streamlining find themselves
working in a changed environment. Consider James Emshoff,
president of Citicorp's Diner's Club unit. Intent on better
serving customers, he slashed layers of management between
himself and first-line supervisors to four from eight, and
restructured many jobs.
   Now the credit-card company's biggest customers receive
customized products and services, and there's speedier
handling of customer complaints. But Mr. Emshoff oversees
eight managers, double the number he used to, while managers
beneath him also must work harder. Yet there are fewer
chances for promotions.
   "People can start worrying about where their careers are
going," Mr. Emshoff says. "You've got to convince them their
success won't be measured by how many times they move up the
pecking order."
   Instead of barking orders, managers must delegate
decisions to employees who may never before have been asked
for an opinion. They must also redefine which tasks are
critical. "It's become fashionable to reduce layers, but if
you don't take out the dumb work with the layers you get
nowhere," says Len Schlesinger, a Harvard Business School
professor.
   When Corning Inc. switched production at its Blacksburg,
Va., plant to auto-pollution-control parts from glass two
years ago, the facility's management went flat by design.
Instead of the four or five layers of management found at
Corning's other factories, the plant employs just seven
managers overseeing about 170 workers.
   Managers at the plant last year averaged 70 to 80 hours a
week on the job, without overtime pay. And that was after the
plant manager, Robert Hoover, did away with a lot of paper
work and other time-consuming tasks. For example, though all
managers at other Corning plants are required to write
quarterly reports, he's the only one who must at Blacksburg.
   "You've got to constantly ask, `Is this necessary, and is
it serving the customer?'" Mr. Hoover says. "Part of my role
is to keep finding something to whack out -- and to make sure
it doesn't grow back like a cancer."
   The plant is organized around five key jobs that all
hourly employees must learn -- and they spend one-fifth of
their time in training. The workers handle many of the jobs
previously done by foremen -- from scheduling overtime and
vacations to handling bottlenecks on the line and tracking
quality. And there's just one layer of managers separating
workers from Mr. Hoover. "There's a lot less formality, and
you can make changes happen on the floor very quickly," Mr.
Hoover says.
   With a leaner structure, however, comes increased stress:
Employees are more visible, and everybody has to be more
productive. "There aren't enough layers to protect average
performers," says Mr. Hoover.
   Not everyone can adjust to such changes. At Eastman Kodak
Co.'s apparatus division, which makes parts for Kodak
printers, copiers and film processors, the management team
was cut by 30% and layers slashed to three from seven.
   But some first-line supervisors, who suddenly had to set
goals and strategy for their products rather than just carry
out orders, "couldn't make it" despite a training course,
says Frank Zaffino, the division's vice president and general
manager. "They were used to being star technicians, not
communicators or leaders."
   Mr. Zaffino is convinced that peeling away management
layers has improved the bottom line. Productivity in the
division has jumped 25% in the past three years, with over
95% of orders now being handled within five days, up from
just 15% of orders in 1986.
   But he's had to relinquish his old policing role. When he
had only three people reporting directly to him, "I could
second-guess them a lot, and end-run them for information,"
he says. Now, overseeing double that number of managers, he
has to trust that they can perform and make decisions. "I can
no longer outmanage them on details," he says.
   Managers who can't say no will soon find themselves on
overload in pancake companies -- or simply unable to
function. "You've got to prioritize," says Cam Starrett, vice
president, personnel and administration, at Maxwell/Macmillan
Group.
   When her boss recently asked her to take on a new project,
she reminded him that her streamlined staff was already
embroiled in three large projects and there was no one to
bounce a fourth one to. He agreed that they couldn't take on
more.
   Since moving to Macmillan about a year ago, Ms. Starrett
has shrunk her staff to 29 from 40 and cut management layers
in half to three. In the old chain of command, supervisors
reported to an assistant manager who in turn reported to a
manager, chief manager, director and finally vice president.
Now the management team consists of Ms. Starrett, three
directors and a dozen or so managers.
   In the old hierarchy, "the boxes were very clear, and
anything that fell between the boxes ended up on the boss's
desk," Ms. Starrett says. "Everyone became very adept at
delegating up." She's tried to reverse that process,
delegating more decision making down the ranks and insisting
on teamwork.
   When the international vice president wanted her to help
set up retirement plans for Australian employees, Ms.
Starrett brought together compensation and benefits managers
to brainstorm and make recommendations. She also assigned one
of the managers to deal directly with the international vice
president.
   That approach, she says, produced "richer" strategic
thinking and a quick response. "But you need people who are
flexible and want to get involved, people who were frustrated
by the old boxes."
   Pancake companies also need managers who relish diversity.
As long as they were overseeing five or 10 people, managers
tended to surround themselves with like-minded people. But
with 50 or 100 subordinates, homogeneity is unlikely.
   Those who tend to communicate by memo -- and who in the
past might have hired subordinates who do the same -- are apt
to find themselves overseeing people who prefer to talk
things out. "If they don't realize that they're managing a
different breed, they won't be able to make themselves
understood," says Don Sayenga, a consultant and former
Bethlehem Steel Corp. executive. He calls this particular
clash "the audio-visual dilemma."
   Moreover, even as managers delegate more, they often must
reacquaint themselves with everyday detail. When Dale Ward
took over as chief executive of National Intergroup Inc.'s
Ben Franklin retail chain, he cut a layer of senior vice
presidents, giving more autonomy to regional vice presidents.
He also got more involved in day-to-day operations --
dropping in at meetings to suggest marketing strategies, for
example, and spending more time with suppliers than his
predecessor.
   In the past, he says, managers "didn't dare trust the
chief executive with any problems. But if you're cutting
staff, you've got to be more involved in everyday matters.
You don't want to do your subordinates' jobs, but you have to
show them you know how to sweep the floor."
