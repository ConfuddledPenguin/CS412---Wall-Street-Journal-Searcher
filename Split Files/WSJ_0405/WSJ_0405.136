   Tokyo stock prices retreated as the comparatively bright
sentiment built the previous day was soured by growing
concern about the financial troubles of some speculator
groups.
   The Nikkei index of 225 issues, which advanced 757.65
points Tuesday, fell 316.78 points yesterday to 28442.94.

   London stocks, meanwhile, were lured lower on the mediocre
early showing from Wall Street.
   Tokyo's Nikkei index, which climbed above 29000 points
during the morning session, gave up its early gains quickly
at midafternoon as investors hurried to reduce their holdings
of speculative shares, including some local bank stocks.
Investors also took profits on high-tech and pharmaceutical
shares, traders said.
   The Nikkei, which was down 670 points at its intraday low,
bounced up 350 points in the last 20 minutes of the day,
helped by arbitrage buying, traders said.
   In Thursday morning trading, the Nikkei index plummeted
during the last hour of trading, finishing the session off
1088.94 to close at 27354, or down 3.8%. The trading day
began with losses of about 450 points. But that accelerated
sharply, one analyst said, after the market was hit by large
block sales of the Topix 1000 index-futures contract, sales
that may have been related to program trading. News of those
sales hastened the decline, with the Nikkei dropping about
400 points in the final half-hour of trading.
   Mike Morizumi, a strategist with Merrill Lynch in Tokyo,
said the market ignored such positive fundamentals as a
stronger yen. The Japanese currency was trading at 157.75 to
the dollar, strengthening from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
158.90.
   Mr. Morizumi said investors appeared preoccupied with
rumors swirling through the market about problems affecting
brokerage firms and investor groups caught by the market's
recent steep decline. "There's broad-based panic selling in
all sectors of the market," he said.
   Volume yesterday on the first section was estimated at 560
million shares, down from 645 million shares Tuesday. Losers
widely outnumbered winners 742 to 180, while 100 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section lost 35.15 points, or 1.67%, to 2075.96. The
index gained 41.78 points Tuesday.
   The second section index, which lost 77.04 points Tuesday,
fell 95.45 points, or 2.66%, to 3490.62. Volume was estimated
at 12 million shares, up from nine million shares Tuesday.
   High-tech shares continued to lead advances in the early
part of the day, as they did Tuesday. The gains spawned
profit-taking, however, and prices in the sector fell by the
end of the morning session.
   It is becoming a "consensus" among investors that the
high-tech sector is the most reliable candidate to lead the
market in a rebound, said Atsushi Koishihara, general manager
of equity division at Taiheiyo Securities.
   But because of a lack of confidence in the market,
investors don't feel secure waiting for stock prices to rise
widely. The investors sell quickly to take advantage of
slight rises in prices, the official said.
   Meanwhile, the financial trouble of groups of stock
speculators fueled fear that withdrawal of their money would
have a larger-than-usual impact on the already bearish
market, traders said. Such groups are under pressure from the
continuous fall of stock prices.
   Only shares that have been the target of the groups fell
on such talk in the morning. But the talk gradually
discouraged buying interest in other shares in the afternoon,
stimulating investors to hurry to take profits, traders said.
   Shigeru Akiba, head of the equity division at UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew International, noted that some stocks surged last year
because of speculative buying regardless of the companies'
earnings.
   Rounds of selling need to be completed to eliminate such
"bubbles" from stock prices, Mr. Akiba said. He added that
such a retreat is one of the processes the market needs to
undergo before recovering.
   High-tech shares finished broadly lower on profit taking.
Kyocera, which advanced 540 yen ($3.39) Tuesday to its
highest level this year, fell 230 yen to 7670 yen. Fanuc was
down 250 yen to 7230 yen, while Pioneer declined 150 yen to
6200 yen.
   Among stocks that are rumored to be held by speculator
groups, Citizen Watch dropped 52 yen to 868 yen. Honshu Paper
lost 300 yen to 1390 yen, while Kyokuyo went down 100 yen to
960 yen.
   London stocks were generally flat for most of the session,
market watchers said, with little turnover or stimulus to
trade. Traders said the market is severely lacking in
inspiration. "There are a few stories out there but there's
nothing driving the market," said one dealer. "We're lacking
motivation."
   The combination of Monday's steep losses and Tuesday's
smart gains have served to confuse investors, traders said,
adding that these conditions are likely to persist until a
clearer near-term trend is spotted.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index fell
9.1 points to 2231.6. The early morning peak was 2247.5; the
index fell as low as 2229.2 in the afternoon.
   The Financial Times 30 share index was down 11.6 points to
1749.7. By recent standards, volume registered a respectable
505.4 million shares, down from the 553.4 million shares
Tuesday.
   Among individual stocks, Hammerson jumped 28 pence to 789
pence after positive responses from analysts touring the
company's European bases, dealers said.
   BAA, the British airports management group, slipped 19
pence to 386 pence following an announcement by Bermuda-based
ADT Ltd. that said it will issue new ADT preference shares,
exchangeable into BAA ordinary shares, to raise #100 million.
ADT controls about 9% of BAA.
   Eurotunnel added 15 pence to 593 pence on the disclosure
of its latest drilling progress report, which said that the
achievement of a mile or more a week is now possible.
Eurotunnel's shares in Paris also gained.
   Sun Alliance advanced 15.5 pence to 303.5 pence. The
composite insurer disclosed full-year earnings that were
largely in line with the market forecasts, but there was
optimism on announcement of a 22% jump in the dividend. One
analyst suggested that the stock is a good value. "The sector
as a whole is one of the best in the market and Sun Alliance
is one of the best-yielding stocks," he said, adding that the
stock is an "absolute cracker" despite market fears that
circulated before the results were disclosed.
   Reuters added 16 pence to #11.59 on top of its 36-pence
jump a day earlier. Dealers said the shares continue to be
bolstered by good comments from analysts meeting this week in
New York and London.
   Lowndes Queensway, the heavily indebted retailer, shed 3/4
pence to 2 1/2 pence, as talk circulated that the household
stores group may have to go into receivership soon.
   J. Sainsbury shed 2 pence to 247 pence, while Tesco
slipped 2.5 pence to 194.5 pence on talk that the two food
retailers look set to enter a price war.
   Elsewhere in Europe, prices rose in Paris, Amsterdam,
Stockholm, Helsinki and Milan, were lower in Frankfurt, and
mixed in Zurich.
   Meanwhile, prices fell in Singapore, Taipei and Seoul,
were mixed in Hong Kong and Wellington, and higher in Sydney
and Manila.
   Separately, Volkswagen AG said it will raise its per-share
dividend on common stock to 11 Deutsche marks from 10 marks.
The West German auto group said it will boost its payout on
nonvoting preferred stock to 12 marks each from 11 marks. The
increase has to be approved by shareholders at the annual
meeting July 19.
