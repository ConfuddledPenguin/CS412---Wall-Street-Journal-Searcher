   LIMA, Peru -- In his novels, Mario Vargas Llosa deals with
corruption, decay, fanaticism and apocalypse. Soon, it
appears, he will grapple with these issues rather than just
write about them.
   Indeed, as Peruvians prepare to elect their new president
on Sunday after a terror-filled campaign, the renowned
novelist-turned-politician appears all but certain to take
the helm of a country whose situation often seems more
surreal than his novels.

   With Peru's economy in shambles, opinion polls show Mr.
Vargas Llosa with about 40% of the vote, far ahead of his
nearest rival, Luis Alva Castro, the candidate of the ruling
American Revolutionary Popular Alliance. If Mr. Vargas Llosa
isn't elected outright on Sunday, a runoff will be held in
late May or early June, and polls show him winning easily.
It's less sure he'll have an absolute majority in Congress,
also up for election Sunday.
   A one-time admirer of Fidel Castro, the 54-year-old Mr.
Vargas Llosa now is a fan of Margaret Thatcher, and pledges
for Peru the sort of free-market shock treatment that other
South American countries such as Brazil and Argentina are
getting. He promises to end food, fuel and medicine subsidies
financed by money-printing, sell state companies, lower
tariff barriers on trade and devalue Peru's currency.
   But Mr. Vargas Llosa and current President Alan Garcia say
Peru can't afford to immediately pay back its $16.7 billion
foreign debt. Mr. Vargas Llosa, however, also talks of
improving relations with foreign creditors, long strained by
Mr. Garcia's confrontational stance. Peru recently resumed
some payments to the International Monetary Fund.
   Mr. Vargas Llosa says his policies are the only way to
prevent Peru from falling into social and economic chaos. The
economy contracted by 10.4% last year. One of the only growth
industries is coca leaf, the base material of cocaine.
   During Mr. Garcia's five-year term, hyperinflation ruled.
Still, there is widespread fear in Peru of rioting if Mr.
Vargas Llosa's adjustment policies are applied as radically
as he wants. Some older politicians in his Democratic Front
Alliance want him to show more concern for protecting
people's jobs in an economy where only about 20% of the work
force is adequately employed.
   Terrorism is another major problem. More than 16,000
people have been killed in 10 years of strife and
counterinsurgency operations. During the election campaign,
Maoist Shining Path guerrillas killed dozens of candidates,
cut electrical power and set off explosions to intimidate
voters.
