   American Savings Bank said it expects to report a
first-quarter loss following a $4 million charge resulting
from nonperforming real estate loans.
   American Savings, White Plains, N.Y., didn't estimate the
extent of the loss. In the 1989 first quarter, it earned $6.5
million, or 88 cents a share.

   The thrift said it continues to evaluate "the upward
trend" in the bank's level of nonperforming assets and the
adverse conditions in the real estate market, and will
determine an appropriate provision for loan losses
accordingly.
   American Savings also announced the resignation of its
executive vice president in charge of real estate lending, H.
L. Van Varick, 50 years old. The thrift said a successor
hadn't been appointed.
   American Savings common stock tumbled 50 cents yesterday
to close at $4.125 a share, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
