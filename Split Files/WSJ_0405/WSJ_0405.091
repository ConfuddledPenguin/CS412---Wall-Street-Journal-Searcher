   NEW YORK -- The dollar amount of corporate bonds
defaulting in the first quarter quadrupled from a year ago,
the latest indication that junk bond default rates could
reach record levels this year.
   Municipal bond defaults increased 37% in the first
quarter, but the rate for the entire year may be lower.

   Those were among the findings in a report issued yesterday
by the Bond Investors Association, a bondholders organization
based in Miami Lakes, Fla.
   The report said that 13 companies defaulted on 38 bond
issues totaling $5.7 billion for the three months through
March. That's up from the $1.3 billion in defaults by nine
companies that occurred in the first quarter of 1989.
   The latest default figures included $3.5 billion of bonds
issued by companies controlled by Canada's Campeau Corp., the
retail and real estate company that operates the struggling
Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. in
the U.S.
   "In light of the first-quarter results and given the
amount of issues on the brink of default, we feel our
prediction of $15 billion in defaults for 1990 (may be)
optimistic," said Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond
Investors Association. He said more defaults are expected
from "poorly structured businesses trying to support
impossible debt loads."
   The report also measured municipal bond defaults, which
were said to have totaled $276.1 million. Mr. Lehmann said
that municipal bond defaults for the entire year, however,
could actually come in lower than last year.
   But that outlook could change depending on one
corporation: First Executive Corp., the big California
insurance company that is one of the largest holders of
high-yield junk bonds.
   First Executive, which recently reported an $835.7 million
fourth-quarter loss largely because of the dwindling value of
its junk bond portfolio, provided guaranteed investment
contracts as backing for more than $1.7 billion of municipal
bonds.
   "These bonds would be at risk should (First Executive) be
seized by the California insurance commissioner," Mr. Lehmann
said. "That could make 1990 a record year for municipal bond
defaults," he said.
