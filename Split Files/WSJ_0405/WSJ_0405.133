   Cie. Generale d'Electricite (CGE) said profit after
payments to minority interests surged to 4.94 billion francs
($865 million) in 1989 from 2.16 billion francs ($378
million) in the previous year, as the French holding company
pursued a variety of acquisitions and alliances to expand its
business internationally.
   Pierre Suard, CGE chief executive officer, said at a news
conference that 1989 was a "very prosperous and rich year"
that saw the electricity group's consolidated revenue rise to
143.9 billion francs from 128 billion in 1988.

   Mr. Suard said the CGE executive board has proposed to
boost the per-share dividend to 11 francs from the nine
francs a share paid out in 1988.
   Mr. Suard also announced that the company plans to issue a
five billion-franc convertible bond issue to help finance
recent acquisitions and to prepare CGE for other
"opportunities" that appear in the future.
