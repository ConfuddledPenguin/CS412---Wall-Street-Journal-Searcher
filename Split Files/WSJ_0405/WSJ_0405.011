   MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. said its Belgian subsidiary,
BN Constructions Ferroviaires et Metaliques S.A., and Holec
N.V. of the Netherlands were awarded a contract of 44 million
Canadian dollars (US$38 million) by HTM, which operates a
public transit system in The Hague, Netherlands.
   The contract is for 34 double-articulated light rail
vehicles, which will be manufactured by BN in Belgium and use
Holec's direct-current traction equipment. Deliveries are to
begin in 1992. Bombardier is a Montreal-based transportation,
defense and aerospace concern.
