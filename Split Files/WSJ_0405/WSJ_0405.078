   News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film unit is joining
the growing wave of Hollywood studios and production firms
seeking financial backing from Japan.
   According to Hollywood studio executives, agents and
investment bankers, at least a half-dozen transactions
involving new Japanese investments in Hollywood are under
discussion. The transactions range from bank financing for
major Hollywood studios to equity investments in companies
headed by individual producers. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., for
example, is attempting to raise money for producer Lee Rich,
partly with Japanese investors. And powerful talent agency
Creative Artists Agency has been approached by a number of
Japanese investors about providing a pool of movie financing
for producers and directors.

   With the Japanese stock market in turmoil, the current
spate of discussions may never materialize into real
transactions. But the Japanese interest in owning a piece of
Hollywood is clearly still going strong. For a large studio
such as Fox, such financing could help in the studio's plans
to significantly boost its annual production of motion
pictures. Its parent, News Corp., is strapped for cash, and
it will take Fox $500 million or more over the next two years
to finance all the movies the studio wants to make.
   Chase Carey, Fox executive vice president, says he
recently spent a week in Japan talking to Japanese companies
about raising funds to back movie production. Although he
stresses that Fox hasn't set a target for how much money it
wants to raise, and may end up doing nothing at all, "We are
exploring the Japanese markets to see what degree of interest
there is to invest money toward film production."
   The Japanese have already made some very big and highly
visible investments in Hollywood, notably Sony Corp.'s $5
billion purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment. On a
smaller scale, JVC Corp. recently invested $100 million in
Largo Productions, producer Larry Gordon's company. And in
December, Morgan Creek Productions, a closely held film
production company, formed a film-financing joint venture
with the Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown unit of Tokyo-based Nomura
Securities Co. Nomura officials acknowledge that they are
close to putting together a film-financing venture for
another Hollywood concern, but decline to identify it.
   MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios is also exploring the
possibility of Japanese financing for motion picture
production. Although company officials declined to discuss
the matter, one executive there said "everybody's talking"
about financing from Japan.
   Although much of the interest in Hollywood comes from
Japanese industrial or trading companies, individual
investors are increasingly interested in U.S. film-financing
partnerships, according to Liz Saxon of Los Angeles-based
Takenaka &amp; Co., which works with Japanese investors in the
U.S. Such partnerships provide tax benefits of the kind that
used to attract U.S. investors before the changes in tax laws
in the U.S. "Securities companies and others in Japan are
putting together funds by selling units to investors," she
said. "Even if the films don't make money, they can still
come out ahead" because of such benefits as accelerated
depreciation of film costs.
   Although a number of the transactions under discussion
involve equity investments, Hollywood studios and production
companies are also looking to Japanese commercial banks for
debt financing and individual project financing. Japanese
banks are offering more-attractive interest rates than U.S.
banks -- and a number of U.S. banks have pulled back from
entertainment lending, burned by the failures of independent
producers. "Clearly American funding sources have slowed,"
says Mr. Carey of Fox. "That's led people to more
aggressively explore overseas lending."
   Spelling Entertainment Inc. which has said it is
considering the possible sale of the company, has had "some
Japanese interest in buying the company," according to Jules
Haimovitz, president of Spelling. However, he said: "I
wouldn't characterize the Japanese interest as aggressive.
They are more interested in film than television. Television
hasn't been as translatable."
   Meanwhile, Carolco Pictures Inc. recently appointed Long
Term Credit Bank of Japan to "seek money in Japan." Peter
Hoffman, president and chief executive officer of Carolco,
declined to say what amount the company hopes to raise. But
he did say the funding would be used to boost production. Mr.
Hoffman also said Mario Kassar, chairman of Carolco, visited
Japan to discuss funding earlier this year.
   A number of Hollywood producers are also making the trek
to Tokyo to seek funding. Producer Edward R. Pressman, for
example, couldn't be reached to comment on Japanese
investment in his films because "he's in Tokyo," said Neal
Weisman, vice president of Edward R. Pressman Film Corp.,
which recently produced the movie "Blue Steel."
   Mr. Weisman said Shochiku-Fuji, a Japanese film
distribution company helped to fund "Reversal of Fortune," a
movie in the works about Claus Von Bulow, and "New Rose
Hotel," a movie that will be directed by Kathryn Bigelow.
That movie will be shot in Tokyo.
   Mr. Weisman said the Japanese will have an equity
investment in the two movies and also have the rights to
distribute the movie in Japan. He said Mr. Pressman made
another trip to Tokyo last month and is talking to other
Japanese entities as well.
   The interest of Japanese investors in the U.S. film
industry is hardly surprising; Japan is the largest foreign
market for U.S. films, and videocassette markets in Japan are
booming. Japanese investors are also cognizant of the scarce
value of motion picture libraries in an era where demand for
U.S. entertainment programming world-wide is growing
exponentially.
   At the same time, observers caution that Japanese
investors are aware of the risk of U.S. film production and
the difficulty outsiders often encounter when trying to get a
share of a studio's closely guarded profits. Japanese
investors "want to invest a lot of money for the right deals
and the right relationships, but they can be conservative and
picky," says Alex Ben Block, who publishes a movie business
newsletter, Show Biz News. "Every hustler can't go to Japan
and get money."
   David Weil, a partner at Los Angeles law firm O'Melveny &amp;
Myers, which represents Japanese investors and U.S.
entertainment interests, says, "There's a misperception in
Hollywood that Japanese investors will do anything to get
into the movie business, and that's causing anyone who has a
script to make the trip to Japan." Even so, he adds, "Many
Japanese investors don't know the best way to enter an
industry which, unlike many others, is likely to be
controlled by Americans for quite a while, and the
uncertainty is causing them to invest in almost a hit or miss
manner."
