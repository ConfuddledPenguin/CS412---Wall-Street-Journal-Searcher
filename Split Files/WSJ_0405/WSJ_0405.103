   ATLANTA -- A federal grand jury is investigating whether
Georgia-Pacific Corp. inflated for tax purposes the value of
Florida swampland that it donated to a state water management
agency in 1984, a grand jury witness said.
   A spokeswoman for Georgia-Pacific, an Atlanta-based
forest-products concern, declined to comment.

   John Flanagan, deputy assistant executive director of the
Suwannee River Water Management District, in Live Oak, Fla.,
said he and another agency member appeared under subpoena
before a grand jury in Atlanta March 13.
   Mr. Flanagan said Martin Weinstein, an assistant U.S.
attorney, inquired about the circumstances under which
Georgia-Pacific donated 5,400 acres of land to the water
management district, a conservation and management agency, in
1984. He said the grand jury also subpoenaed the agency's
records related to Georgia-Pacific's donation of the Santa Fe
Swamp tract, which is north of Little Santa Fe Lake in
Bradford County.
   Mr. Flanagan said the U.S. attorney is focusing on a $24
million tax deduction that Georgia-Pacific took as a result
of the donation. Georgia-Pacific reportedly purchased the
land in 1981 for $1.9 million. Prosecutors couldn't be
reached for comment.
