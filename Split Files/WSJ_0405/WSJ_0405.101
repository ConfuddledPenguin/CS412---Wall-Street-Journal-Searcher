   Circle K Corp. won some breathing room in its fight to
stave off bankruptcy proceedings and remain a viable
convenience-store chain.
   In an announcement late last night, the company said it
signed a preliminary accord with senior creditors and its
largest shareholder for a seven-month moratorium on debt and
interest payments, narrowly averting default on part of its
debt.

   The accord is subject to a definitive agreement. Circle K,
an operator of convenience stores throughout the Southwest,
had said it was considering filing for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Circle K Chairman Karl Eller, the energetic entrepreneur
under whose leadership the Phoenix, Ariz., company mushroomed
from a midsize regional concern to one of the largest
convenience-store operators in the nation, wasn't mentioned
in the three-page news release announcing the agreement.
However, outside directors have said that he wasn't part of
the negotiating team seeking to restructure much of the
company's more than $1 billion in long-term debt.
   "Mr. Eller is still with the company and there hasn't been
any discussion of Mr. Eller leaving the company," a spokesman
said. He declined to comment on terms of the agreement.
   The agreement is among the company's banks, a steering
committee for holders of its $200 million in senior secured
notes, and American Financial Corp., the company's largest
shareholder with a 38% stake and a substantial creditor.
American Financial is controlled by Cincinnati financier Carl
Lindner, a longtime business associate of Mr. Eller's.
   The provisional pact is conditional on all sides signing a
definitive standstill agreement that would hold through the
earlier of Oct. 31 or completion of financial rearrangements.
   During the waiting period, the banks, noteholders, and
American Financial would defer all principal and interest
payments and would waive any existing defaults under current
loan agreements.
   The prospective accord appears to hand considerable power
to the banks, which would exercise a veto right on all
interest payments on Circle K's $510 million of subordinated
debt.
   The standstill agreement would require that by the end of
October Circle K acquire at least 90% of its subordinated
debt. It wasn't clear what action might be taken by holders
of these securities, which include 7.25% convertible
subordinated debentures due 2006; 8.25% converitible
subordinated debentures due 2005, 12.75% senior subordinated
debentures due 1997; and 13% junior subordinated debentures
due 1997. Certain private indebtedness is also included in
this class.
   Circle K stock closed yesterday at $1.25 a share, down
12.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The company said terms of its offer to subordinated
holders hasn't been determined. It hinted at an exchange of
stock for subordinated debt and said a registration statement
is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission before May 15.
   Meanwhile, Circle K said it believes it has sufficient
funds to meet trade obligations during the standstill period.
   It said parties to the agreement plan to execute new
long-term financial arrangements.
   As part of the pact, Circle K said it has agreed in
principle to sell Circle K's New England Petroleum
Distributor operations for $26 million to Charter Co., a
51%-owned subsidiary of American Financial. The transaction
is tentatively scheduled to close April 12, subject to
certain conditions.
   The company said it is being advised by Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets on financial arrangements.
   Circle K, from a relatively sleepy chain of 1,300 stores
in 1983, exploded under Mr. Eller's management to 4,700
outlets at the end of last year. Growth came through a steady
diet of high-yield debt.
   Mr. Eller's preoccupation with expansion, however,
apparently wasn't matched by an ability to mind the stores,
and a host of problems arose in recent years. Mr. Eller's
hopes apparently were unhampered, and he put the company on
the block last year, betting Circle K would fetch a fancy
price. It didn't, and losses soon cropped up.
   The company late last month reported a $28.1 million loss
for the third quarter ended Jan. 31 on revenue of $872.5
million.
   At that time, Circle K said it was in technical violation
of convenants on bank debt, adding that the non-compliance
was waived for a period ending this Friday, when a $60
million portion of the about $340 million in bank debt
matures.
