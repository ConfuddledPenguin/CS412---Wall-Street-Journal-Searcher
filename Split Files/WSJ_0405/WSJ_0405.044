   DALLAS -- Hoping to bolster business prior to the pivotal
Easter travel weekend, strikebound Greyhound Lines Inc. said
it was increasing service in its Eastern division and
offering passengers in some cities free-round trip tickets if
buses don't arrive within 15 minutes of their scheduled time.
   Greyhound Lines, a unit of GLI Holding Co., said it would
begin offering hourly departures from New York to Boston,
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., on Fridays and Sundays and
that service between New York and eight Northeastern cities,
plus Miami, had been restored to pre-strike levels.

   The company said the free round-trip tickets would be
available to passengers traveling between any of nine cities,
including Boston, Philadelphia and Washington.
   A company spokesman said the additions would put the
company's miles of scheduled service at about 55% of
prestrike levels and that, as of Tuesday, Greyhound was
carrying about 47% the number of passengers as the same day a
year ago. Officials at the striking Amalgamated Transit Union
claim both figures are inflated.
   The promotional campaign comes as a walkout by 9,300 ATU
members enters its second month. Amid continued vandalism and
sniper attacks on Greyhound buses, no talks have been
scheduled.
