   Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Italy's largest, state-owned
commercial bank, posted a consolidated net loss of 240
billion lire ($192.1 million) in 1989.
   Milan-based BNL, which emerged last autumn at the center
of a major financial scandal involving its Atlanta branch and
some $3 billion of irregular loans to Iraq, said the losses
reflected the plunge in profit announced recently by its
parent bank.

   The parent bank reported a loss of 498 billion lire in
1989, compared with profit of 105 billion lire a year
earlier. BNL attributed the losses to a major cleanup of its
balance sheet following the scandal.
   The 1989 consolidated loss "significantly absorbs the 498
billion-lire loss posted by the parent bank," BNL said in a
statement.
   BNL also reported that consolidated gross profit, net of
extraordinary items, rose 31% to 1.058 trillion lire last
year from 807 billion lire in 1988. BNL's directors also
proposed a total of 778 billion lire be allocated for risk
funds, against 390 billion lire in 1988.
