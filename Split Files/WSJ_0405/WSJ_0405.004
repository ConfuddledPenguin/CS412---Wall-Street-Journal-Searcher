   BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Budapest's five luxury hotels are
jammed with American, German, British, South Korean,
Austrian, Japanese and French business executives. All are
looking for joint-venture deals or Hungarian companies in
which to invest the $80 million to $100 million entrusted to
them by institutional investors eager to cash in on Eastern
Europe.
   But the pickings are getting slim -- fast. "There are
maybe 50 -- maximum -- state companies capable of absorbing
an investment of $100 million or $150 million," says Daniel
S. Fogel, dean of the International Management Center here.

   Two thick books list 67 state companies eager to marry
rich benefactors; most are Stalinian white elephants that
make low-quality, high-cost steel or machine tools. The 4th
of April Machine Factory in Kiskunfelegyhaza makes boilers
and air conditioners and offers a Western partner a
52,000-square-foot workshop and 1,106 employees. The Duna
Shoe Factory needs a few hundred thousand dollars to buy new
stitching and gluing machines; it posted a loss of 80 million
forints ($1.3 million) last year. On the government's list of
its 50 most promising companies is a maker of vacuum tubes,
an item that most of the world long ago replaced with
transistors.
   Investing here requires an on-the-ground presence. Stephen
Frater, chief executive of Cohfin, Italian industrialist
Carlo De Benedetti's new Hungarian investment company, opened
shop Dec. 1 in the Hotel Gellert. He has $50 million he would
like to deploy this year. So far he has signed four letters
of intent with potential partners: a porcelain maker, a
printer, a retail store and a financial-services company.
   "Once you find a company you then have to roll up your
sleeves and slog through a nonsensical set of numbers, then
sit down with your own auditors and reconstruct the balance
sheet," says Mr. Frater. Hungary "is not a place to fly in,
have a round of meetings, fly out and come back when the
papers are ready."
   The problems aren't just bureaucratic. Mr. Frater's phone
rings.
   "Yes, yes. We're ready to close the deal. We're prepared
to put a payment in escrow."
   Pause.
   "Escrow. E-S-C-R-O-W. It means we put the money in a bank
account and he gets it when the deal is done."
   Pause.
   "Oh, come over tomorrow and I'll explain it to you."
