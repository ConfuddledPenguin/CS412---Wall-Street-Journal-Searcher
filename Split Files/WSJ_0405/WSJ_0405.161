   SAN FRANCISCO -- Chevron Corp. said its Chevron Chemical
Co. unit acquired the 50% it didn't own in Orogil S.A., a
French-based maker of fuel and lubricating additives, from
Rhone-Poulenc S.A. for an undisclosed amount.
   Chevron acquired its original stake in Orogil and an
option for the remaining 50% in 1987. It took over management
at that time. Orogil operates a plant at Gonfreville, France.
Since the 1987 investment, marketing of Orogil's output has
been integrated with Chevron's world-wide additives
marketing.

   Chevron, based in San Francisco, also said it will close
its lubricating oil additives plant in east Los Angeles early
next year, shifting that production to other facilities.
   The company attributed the closure to the plant's age and
to increasingly stringent air quality requirements in the Los
Angeles area. The plant has about 60 employees. A spokesman
for Chevron said the company's newest investment in Orogil
and its intended closure of the Los Angeles facility aren't
related.
   Separately, Chevron's Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co.
unit said it signed a letter of intent to form an equal joint
venture with Black Beauty Resources Inc. for the operation of
five coal mines in Indiana and Illinois. The amount of
Chevron's payment for its 50% stake in the partnership wasn't
disclosed. The venture will be known as Black Beauty Coal Co.
   The reserves acquired contain largely low-sulfur coal,
which Chevron has said it expects to become increasingly
sought after with new clean-air standards.
   Production from the five Black Beauty mines totaled 4.2
million tons last year. Pittsburg &amp; Midway, which operates
nine mines in six states, produced 15.1 million tons in 1989.
Closely held Black Beauty Resources is based in Evansville,
Ind.
