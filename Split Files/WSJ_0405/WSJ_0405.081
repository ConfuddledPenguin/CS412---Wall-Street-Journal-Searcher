   Yields on money-market mutual funds remained relatively
flat in the latest week, but assets posted the largest drop
since early January.
   The average seven-day compound yield slipped to 7.97% from
7.98% in the week ended Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the
current yield continues for a year.

   Assets of the 426 taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's fell
by $1.5 billion to $383.6 billion. The previous decline in
assets was less than $900 million in mid-March. Assets
dropped by $3.6 billion in early January, although that was
attributed to seasonal factors.
   The latest week's drop was across the board, said Brenda
Malizia Negus, editor of the newsletter, affecting general
purpose funds, broker-dealer funds and funds open only to
institutions. But Ms. Negus called the decline "not
statistically significant," noting that it was well under 1%
of total assets.
   Although the deadline for paying income taxes is less than
two weeks away, Ms. Negus said it's a bit early for that to
be a significant factor in money-fund assets. The latest
totals reflect checks written a week ago or more.
   Assets rose steadily last spring as yields reached their
recent highs. There was a falloff of about $435 million at
the end of April, which analysts then attributed to an
attractive stock market. Total money-fund assets have
increased about $80 billion since then.
   The latest money-fund yields reflect generally unchanged
interest rates. Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for
instance, yielded just two-hundredths of a percentage point
less than the week before. Yields on bank certificates of
deposit also were little changed in the latest week.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments, which include
short-term Treasury securities, CDs and commercial paper
(short-term corporate IOUs), remained at 45 days. Maturities
are thought to indicate which way portfolio managers think
rates are headed; longer maturities permit them to lock in
relatively high yields when rates are falling just as short
maturities allow them to capture rising rates sooner.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slid to 7.67% from 7.69%. The average 30-day simple yield
edged up to 7.67% from 7.66% and the average 30-day compound
yield rose to 7.97% from 7.95%.
   Yields on tax-free funds rose. The average seven-day
compound yield of the 220 tax-exempt funds tracked by
Donoghue's rose to 5.57% from 5.49%. That's equal to 7.74%
for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and 8.31% in the 33%
bracket.
   Assets of the tax-free funds fell by just under $100
million to $77.3 billion, while average maturity remained at
46 days.
