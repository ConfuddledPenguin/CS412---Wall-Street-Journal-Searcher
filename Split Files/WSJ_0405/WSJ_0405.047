   BORLANGE, Sweden -- Saturday night in Steeltown,
Scandinavia.
   Smoke belches from a forest of smokestacks. Snow falls on
Main Street. Teenagers huddle, waiting to hear a local punk
band called Dead Future. "They scream too much but their
lyrics are good," says Nikolas Tyde, a broad-shouldered
17-year-old blond. "They sing about Sweden going down. There
is revolution in Eastern Europe, and what happens here?" He
stamps cold feet, crushes a Coke can. "Same rules. New
taxes."

   Such are the stirrings of trouble in paradise. Sweden --
placid, prosperous, and smug -- has the shivers. Economic
stagnation is pinching the social-welfare life style to which
Swedes are accustomed. Rapid change abroad, coupled with
inertia at home, has Swedes wondering if their vaunted model
is falling out of fashion.
   This self-doubt is surfacing just as Eastern Europeans
flood to Stockholm for tutelage in Sweden's "middle way"
between communism and capitalism: a free-market economy,
committed to social justice.
   "The Swedish model doesn't suit Eastern Europe -- or us
anymore," says Ake Andersson, director of Stockholm's
Institute for Future Studies. "We were never a Romania or
Poland."
   Instead, Sweden was a small, homogenous and thriving
nation when it fashioned the high-tax welfare state that has
become its trademark. Mr. Andersson adds that the Swedish
model, with its tight central controls, isn't agile enough to
fit a dynamic European market. "We're still trying to dance
classical ballet on the set of `West Side Story,'" he says.
   Swedish angst requires some perspective. Sweden has
unemployment of 1.4%, a budget surplus and well-swept streets
crowded with Saabs. Pressed to identify decline, Swedes
usually point to litter on the subway or the sight of
beggars.
   Even so, worrying signs are appearing. Sweden's wage
inflation of 10% is double the European average, its growth
rate of 1.5% is less than half the Continent's. Soaring costs
threaten Sweden's export-oriented industries, which also face
tougher competition from a uniting Europe.
   The biggest growth area of the Swedish economy, the public
sector, consumes 61% of gross national product. Government
attempts at austerity have flopped.
   History helps explain why Sweden resists change -- and why
no nation outside Scandinavia has come close to replicating
its success. Sweden last fought a war in 1814, missed the
1930s depression, and boomed after World War II, when Europe
and Japan lay in tatters. With its overwhelmingly Nordic,
Lutheran and well-educated population, Sweden has enjoyed
remarkable consensus. The Social Democrats have ruled for 52
of the past 58 years.
   Sweden's welfare state remains the world's most lavish and
equitable, providing basic hospital care for under $10 a day,
high-quality education for nominal fees, and generous child
allowances.
   Swedes may take 15 months parental leave -- a year at 90%
to 100% pay, the rest at a lower rate -- and parents may
split the time. Workers get a minimum of five paid weeks of
vacation a year.
   Sweden's taxes, long the world's highest, are falling,
with the highest marginal tax rate currently 62%. But to
maintain revenue, the state has raised sales taxes and
extended them to more goods, pushing already high prices into
the stratosphere. A gallon of gas costs $4, a pack of
cigarettes $5, a pint of beer $7, and a loaf of white bread
$3 to $4, though housing is affordable. Overall, Swedes' real
income has been flat for 20 years.
   More irksome to many Swedes is what they regard as the Big
Brother tendencies of their carefully engineered state.
Non-cable television is limited to two state-run channels,
which broadcast only about seven hours a day. Television and
radio advertising is prohibited on these channels, which are
the only ones that most Swedes receive. Alcohol sales are
barred at nights and on weekends. Private schools and
hospitals are almost nonexistent. The 23% sales tax largely
dictates how Swedes spend their money.
   Though almost all are middle class, many speak enviously
of what they perceive as greater buying power in the U.S.
High taxes and small wage differentials between skilled and
unskilled work have sapped incentive to work overtime or to
gain skills that bring little extra money.
   Stefan Johansson assembles truck engines on Saab-Scania's
"disco line," so-called because the unit spent its annual
bonus on a quadraphonic sound system. On this day, as on most
others, a third of the factory's work force is off sick, on
holiday or on other authorized leave.
   "A lot of the young guys aren't motivated," says Mr.
Johansson, 38, greasing engine parts to the beat of
heavy-metal music. The biggest problem, he says, is abuse of
fully paid sick leave. "Why work when you can earn the same
at home?"
   With unemployment so low, workers know they can easily
find other jobs if they are dissatisfied. Last year,
Saab-Scania had 29% turnover, twice the rate that prevailed
in 1985. The mobility and the absenteeism mean that new
people are always on the line, hampering productivity and
quality control.
   Swedes are slowly accepting the need for incentives. Top
tax rates fall to 50% next year. Sick leave is likely to be
reformed, with employers assuming more control over
absentees. But Sweden seems reluctant to go beyond
fine-tuning its system. Says the Future Institute's Mr.
Andersson: "You can't slaughter sacred cows overnight, even
if it's the only way to keep your belly full."
   With a third of Swedish workers in the public sector --
more than double the U.S. rate -- Swedes strongly resist
dismantling the bureaucracy.
   But almost every economic indicator is dire. Consumer
prices leaped 3.2% in January, and some big multinationals
have reported falling profits. Swedish industries, which
export 40% of their output, are rapidly moving production to
such countries as Portugal, where costs are lower.
   Borlange, an industrial city in the piney woods of central
Sweden, has kept unemployment to nearly zero through
retraining and other measures, even though the steelworks has
cut its labor force by half.
   At a high-tech paper mill, many workers labor without a
foreman, in a factory with 50-foot-high windows and wall
murals of woods and ponds. The last major strike at the mill
was in 1909.
   Yet young people feel aimless, trapped and most of all,
bored. The popular punk band, Dead Future, speaks to the
young by singing about drugs and hatred for the city's Middle
Eastern immigrants -- a common scapegoat for the strains in
Sweden's welfare system.
   "For too long we assumed that taking care of physical
needs was enough," says Mr. Andersson, a former defense
minister and currently regional head of the Social Democrats.
He says Sweden can learn from Eastern Europe. The turmoil
there, he says, shows that even the most fossilized systems
can change. "Now that communism is dying," he says, "perhaps
we need a new middle way between the old Sweden and the new
Europe."
