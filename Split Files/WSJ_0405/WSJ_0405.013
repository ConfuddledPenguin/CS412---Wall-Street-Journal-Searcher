   LONDON -- Researchers at International Business Machines
Corp. achieved a milestone in ultramicroscopic manufacturing,
by "writing" with individual atoms on a metal surface.
   The researchers used a special IBM-invented microscope to
position individual atoms of xenon gas precisely on a nickel
plate. They arranged the xenon atoms into patterns -- for
instance, tracing out the letters "IBM" in lines one atom
wide.

   The technological feat, described in today's issue of
Nature, a weekly British science journal, is the latest of
several recent steps towards the ultimate in
micromanufacturing: precise manipulation of individual atoms
and molecules. Scientists talk of one day being able to make
ultrasmall electronic circuitry, with dimensions of just one
atom or molecule. By comparison, the circuitry in today's
top-performance computer chips is at least 1,000 times more
coarse. In theory, smaller circuitry permits faster, less
expensive and more complex computing.
   But at the moment, such research is more laboratory
curiosity than commercial reality. In their Nature report,
the IBM researchers said use of their technique may be
limited to certain types of atoms and molecules. Also, the
equipment they used is too costly and complex to contemplate
commercial applications anytime soon.
   The technique, developed at IBM's Almaden Research Center
in San Jose, Calif., uses the so-called scanning tunnelling
microscope. The device, for whose invention two IBM
scientists shared a Nobel Prize in 1987, is normally used in
physics and materials laboratories to produce images of
individual atoms and molecules. The microscope has a
single-atom tip that, when energized by a tiny electric
current, can trace the atomic surface contours of many
materials.
   By simply increasing the electric current passing through
the tip, the Almaden researchers converted the device from a
"reader" of atomic structures to a "writer." Specifically,
the researchers scattered xenon atoms at random over a nickel
surface, and then used the microscope's tip to drag each
xenon atom into its desired position on the nickel surface.
The result was uniform lines of closely spaced xenon atoms on
top of the nickel surface.
