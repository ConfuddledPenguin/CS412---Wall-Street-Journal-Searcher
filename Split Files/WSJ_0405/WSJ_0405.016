   ASHLAND, Ky. -- Ashland Oil Inc. agreed to sell its
industrial boiler business to Deutsche Babcock
Aktiengesellschaft of West Germany. The company declined to
disclose the proposed sale price.
   Initially, Deutsche Babcock will buy a 20% interest in the
Ashland unit, Riley Consolidated, which is based in
Worcester, Mass. Deutsche Babcock is obligated to buy the
remaining 80% by Sept. 25, 1991, if certain operating results
are achieved. If the goals aren't met, Ashland could be
required to repurchase the 20% interest for a nominal price,
Ashland said.

   Riley designs and produces steam generating boilers,
mainly for electric utilities. Annual sales are about $100
million, said H. Kerner Smith, Riley president and chief
executive officer. He said the unit has been incurring
losses, but "is turning the corner, and ongoing operations
are profitable." Sales have been as high as $250 million
during years of high spending by electric utilities, he said.
   The purchase will give Deutsche Babcock an entry into the
U.S. boiler market, Mr. Smith said. Deutsche Babcock is a
major participant in the world market, he said, with more
than $1.5 billion of annual sales of boilers and related
products.
   Ashland said the agreement will have no effect on fiscal
1990 earnings. Transaction results will be deferred until
September 1991, Ashland said. Ashland is an oil refiner and
marketer that has diversified into chemicals, engineering and
other activities.
