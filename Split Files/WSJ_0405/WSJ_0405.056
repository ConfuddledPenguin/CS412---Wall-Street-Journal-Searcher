   NEW YORK -- The stock of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. took a
hit on news that the firm's auction of Impressionist and
modern paintings in London Tuesday night flopped. In more
than triple the usual volume, Sotheby's stock slid 1 1/4, or
6%, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, to 21 3/8.
   The issue for investors is whether the auction, which took
in $63 million, well below Sotheby's pre-sale estimate of $75
million to $99 million, was an aberration. Was it, as
Sotheby's officials and supporters maintain, a minor-league
sale that lacked a masterpiece and included some ho-hum
paintings? Or was it the first sign that the Japanese
collectors who have been major players in the art market are
retreating because of the plunge in the Tokyo stock market?

   "The sale was a midseason, minor" auction, said Michael
Ainslie, chairman of the firm, from London. Some of the
artworks up for bid were not "fresh to the market," and
others may have had unrealistically high price estimates.
About $35 million of the total spent at the auction came from
Japanese bidders, including the $6.1 million for a Marc
Chagall painting that broke the artist's record, said Mr.
Ainslie.
   A Monday-evening London auction by Sotheby's counterpart,
London-based Christie's International PLC, had similar dim
results. The sales total also came in below the lowest
pre-sale estimate and 21% of the artworks, by dollar value,
didn't sell. However, some of the most expensive paintings at
both auctions were purchased by Japanese collectors. Said Mr.
Ainslie, the Japanese "are by no means out of the market."
   Neither are some of the institutional players in Sotheby's
stock. Michael Gaffney of Security Pacific Investment
Managers Inc. of Los Angeles, which has an undisclosed
position in the stock, said he isn't selling as the result of
"one bad auction."
   But a Wall Street bearish on art has been battering
Sotheby's shares lately; in early March, the stock was
trading at almost four above its current level. Its all-time
high was $37, reached Oct. 19.
   Ken Heebner of Capital Growth Management, which is
affiliated with Loomis Sayles, said he sold more than 660,000
shares of Sotheby earlier this year -- not because he thought
the art boom had ended, but because he expects it to end "at
some point" and didn't want to try to time the bust.
   Is the bloom off the art boom? Not yet, say some art
dealers, who blame the failure of the Sotheby's sale on the
lack of exciting merchandise and a softening in demand for
"second" and "third" tier Impressionist works that sell for a
mere $1 million or so. Yet at another Sotheby's auction
yesterday in London, of Russian avant-garde paintings from
the famed Costakis collection, 76% of the works, by dollar
value, didn't sell.
   But analysts who had been bullish on Sotheby's stock
through its long run-up in 1988 and 1989 aren't changing
their tune. They say Sotheby's, which has no debt and now
trades at less than 10 times estimated 1990 earnings, remains
a good buy. Moreover, Sotheby's is broadening its business
beyond the art market with a controversial plan to build a
tower of luxury condominium apartments atop its Manhattan
auction headquarters.
   Salomon Brothers analyst Harvey Katz is maintaining his
earnings estimates of $2.25 a share this year -- and
recommends buying the stock on weakness. Mr. Katz bases his
continued bullishness on three factors: Sotheby's
first-quarter auction totals were sharply above last year's
levels; Japanese buying is "visible and strong," and some
artworks up for auction at Sotheby's blockbuster sales in May
are of exceptional quality.
   "Wall Street's perception is that the art market is one
market, and one bad sale will panic the whole world," said
Fred Wintzer of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, who reaffirmed his buy
recommendation yesterday. But the art boom, and Sotheby's
profits, are far more broadly based than the weakening
Impressionist sector, he says.
   But even its boosters agree that there may be booby traps
on Sotheby's balance sheet, perhaps most prominently its
policy of guaranteeing a minimum take to certain consigners
of major art collections, and its willingness to grant loans
using art as collateral. Sotheby's loan in 1987 of $25
million to Australian businessman Alan Bond looked dicey
until he recently paid it off.
   Will the perception that art is less of a sure-fire
investment after this week's sales cause buyers to step back
from the plate at the Sotheby's May sales? Those major
auctions usually account for a sizable chunk of its annual
revenue.
   "That's the billion-dollar question," said Salomon's Mr.
Katz. "But I don't think you can ring the bell and say it's
over yet."
