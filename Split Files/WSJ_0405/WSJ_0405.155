   Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, a contributor to the Spectator,
writing in the April 1 issue of National Review:

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan people have extinguished the romantic dream
in the most subversive way possible, by ballot. They voted
against all this romance, and poetry, and patriotism, and
revolutionary machismo. They want to be dull, like Costa
Ricans. Dull and fat in the American back yard.
