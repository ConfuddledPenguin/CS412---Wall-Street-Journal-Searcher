   One of the firms that three months ago gave investors a
chance to bet against the Japanese stock market now is
providing an opportunity to profit from that market's
recovery.
   Salomon Inc. yesterday offered to investors 6.5 million
warrants entitling holders to receive cash if the Nikkei
index of 225 leading stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rises
above a predetermined level over the next three years.

   So far this year, the Japanese stock market has plunged
under the weight of soaring Japanese interest rates, a
weakening yen, fears of inflation and eroding confidence in
Japan's monetary authorities. As of yesterday, the Nikkei
index stood 27% below the peak levels it reached on the last
trading day of 1989.
   The Salomon warrants, which are being underwritten by
Salomon Brothers Inc., the company's securities subsidiary,
and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., are designed for both individual and
institutional investors.
   The warrants, which were sold out at an initial offering
price of $2.99 each, began trading on the American Stock
Exchange yesterday at $3.375. They closed at $3.125, down 25
cents on a volume of 2.94 million warrants.
   Like options, warrants give holders the right, but not the
obligation, to sell (with put warrants) or purchase (with
call warrants) a security, currency, or, in this case, the
cash equivalent of a market index at a specific price on or
before a specific date.
   The new call warrants could be useful to speculators who
want to bet that Japanese stocks will finally recover from
their three-month tumble and investors who want to hedge
against short positions, or existing bets that the Tokyo
market will keep declining.
   Given the current gloomy situation in the Tokyo stock
market and frenzied trading conditions on several recent
days, the new warrants would seem suitable for only intrepid
investors. But people who bought the Nikkei put warrants,
which were issued by Salomon and several other U.S.
securities firms just before the Tokyo market began falling
sharply, so far have every reason to be pleased. The Nikkei's
27% decline this year has pushed the price of the warrants up
214% to 250%.
   The first Nikkei put warrants, designed by Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co., were issued by the Kingdom of Denmark on Jan. 12. Five
days later, Salomon issued its warrants; it followed up with
a second series on Feb. 15.
   Earlier in February, Bankers Trust New York Corp. issued
Nikkei puts with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. as chief underwriter. In
addition, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. has announced plans to bring
out its own put warrants, and investment bankers say others
are in the pipeline.
   Salomon and other firms initially helped create a market
for their puts with negative analyses on the prospects for
Japanese share prices. On Jan. 18 -- when the Nikkei stood at
36,729.46 -- Salomon told clients that it expected the index
"to fall below 35,000 and perhaps test the 32,000 level."
   Again on March 8, Salomon predicted that the Nikkei would
tumble to 27,000 to 30,000 before a "near-term bottoming out"
occurred. On that day, the Nikkei closed at 33,690.89. The
all-time high was 38,915.87 set on Dec. 29, 1989.
   Now, however, Salomon says some of its customers feel the
time may be right for a recovery. On March 22, the firm told
clients the Nikkei could bottom "close to 27,000." The Nikkei
closed Wednesday at 28,442.94, down 316.78.
   "When we first came out with the puts, there was plenty of
demand for puts because a lot of people thought the Tokyo
market was overvalued," said a Salomon analyst. "Now that
Japan is way down -- it is almost 10,000 points below three
months ago -- investors figure the market can bounce back."
   They are getting lots of new warrants to test this theory.
On Tuesday, Salomon's Swiss subsidiary issued 1.5 million
16-month call warrants on the Nikkei. These are traded over
the counter.
   And Societe Generale, one of France's biggest banks,
announced yesterday that its Dutch subsidiary would issue one
million call warrants on the Nikkei. The 20-month instruments
will begin trading on the Paris, London, Luxembourg and
Zurich stock exchanges on May 14.
   "With the Nikkei index having fallen so much this year,
this instrument would be a good vehicle for playing a sharp
recovery in the Japanese stock market," said Gilles
Bazy-Sire, a first vice president at Societe Generale
Securities Corp. in New York. He added that they would also
be "a good hedging instrument for people who already own
puts, have made some money on them but don't yet want to sell
them."
   Salomon's new Nikkei warrants in the U.S. can be exercised
at the Nikkei's close yesterday, 28,442.94. If the index
rises above that level, the instruments can be exercised --
in lots of 500 or more -- by selling them back to Salomon at
any time prior to their expiration on April 6, 1993.
Alternatively, they can also be sold on the Amex.
   In return for exercising the warrants, an investor
receives the dollar-equivalent of one-fifteenth of the amount
that the Nikkei index at the time exceeds the exercise, or
"strike," price, which is calculated in yen. The exchange
rate is set at 158.80 yen to the dollar.
   By having a fixed exchange rate, the investor is protected
against the yen weakening further. On the other hand, the
investor is also giving up an opportunity for a currency gain
if the yen were to rise against the dollar, thus making the
index worth more. So far this year, the dollar has risen
10.5% against the yen.
