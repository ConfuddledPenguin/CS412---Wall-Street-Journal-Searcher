   Louisville, Ky. -- At the Humana Festival of New American
Plays at the Actors Theatre of Louisville (ATL), visitors see
seven plays in a single weekend, productions unfolding
morning, afternoon and evening with a logistical expertise
the Pentagon would envy. This year's recently completed
festival was the 14th. Through the years there have been
marked ups and downs in the quality of the plays offered, but
some things have been constant: The productions are expertly
designed and mounted and the event continues to bring
together more theater people -- critics, playwrights,
dramaturgs -- from more parts of the world than any other
single gathering. Despite its many virtues, however, the
festival after all this time remains a weekend in search of
an identity.
   Take, for example, the matter of commissioned plays:
Should they be the centerpiece of the festival, or on the
periphery? Several years ago, ATL Producing Director Jon Jory
began offering handsome commissions for new plays, not only
to playwrights but to well-known novelists and journalists.
Dramatists felt the commissions should go to young
playwrights; other detractors claimed it was primarily a
public-relations move.

   Mr. Jory himself acknowledges that he has learned a few
lessons. "Journalists like William F. Buckley and Jimmy
Breslin didn't work out too well," he admits. "I also
discovered that it takes longer for a commissioned work to
come to fruition than I originally thought: two to three
years instead of one." But Mr. Jory is clear in his rationale
for bringing novelists into the mainstream of theater
writing. "Ours is the only culture in Western civilization
that does not think of the writer in terms of many forms:
short story, novel and drama. I think we should change that."
   In support of his ideas, the two most interesting plays in
this year's festival were the commissioned works, one from
veteran playwright Romulus Linney and the other from novelist
Joyce Carol Oates. Mr. Linney's "2" is a backstage look at
the prosecution of Hermann Goering during the Nuremberg
trials in 1945-46. Goering was an unwavering No. 2 to Hitler
even though the fuehrer had ordered his execution and that of
Goering's wife and daughter. An incorrigible, unrepentant
Nazi, Goering charmed his guards and easily bested the
American prosecutor, Robert Jackson, during his
cross-examination. It was the British prosecutor, and the
graphic, sickening films of concentration camps -- shown as
part of the Linney play -- that actually led to Goering's
conviction.
   The play's chief flaw is a minor one: The friendship
between Goering and one of his guards, a sergeant who shares
his admiration for the paintings of Lucas Cranach, stretches
credulity. If Mr. Linney can eliminate this and a couple of
other minor problems he will have an important play on his
hands. The Louisville production, astutely directed by Thomas
Allan Bullard, featured William Duff-Griffin in a riveting
performance as Goering.
   For her part, Ms. Oates was almost as obsessed with the
fascination of evil as Mr. Linney in her two one-act plays
paired under the title of "In Darkest America." In the first
one, she used projections of photographs and an offstage
voice to augment the predicament of a typical suburban
husband and wife whose 22-year-old son has sexually molested
and murdered a 14-year-old girl. The play is somewhat
attenuated despite all this, the juxtaposition of the
banality of the couple's existence with the violence of the
crime and the cosmic questions raised by the offstage voice
make for an unusual theater piece.
   The second Oates play is more traditional as well as more
successful. A grown daughter, Stephanie Washburn (Beth
Dixon), a rising star in the feminist movement, shares an
apartment with her eccentric mother, Muriel (Madeleine
Sherwood). Just at the point where Stephanie is scheduled to
attend a national conference crucial to her career, the
mother careens out of control, developing among other things
a fantasy affair with a young Latin lover. As Stephanie tries
to decide whether or not to go ahead with her plans, the
whole of the tortured relationship between mother and
daughter is bared and terrible truths are unearthed. With her
ear for dialogue, her natural affinity for melodrama and her
penetrating sense of character, Ms. Oates clearly should
continue to write for the theater.
   Another confusing issue is whether the festival's plays
should be regarded as finished scripts or works in progress.
Mr. Jory insists that an important function of the festival
is to allow playwrights "to see an unfinished work presented
in a first-class production before a sophisticated
audience."A good example was this year's "Infinity's House"
by Ellen McLaughlin. The setting is the American desert, in
fact, three deserts. Ms. McLaughlin moves back and forth from
the Nevada desert of 1850 with California-bound pioneers, to
Promontory Point in Utah in 1869 where Chinese laborers were
finishing the transcontinental railroad, and to the desert in
New Mexico in 1945, where J. Robert Oppenheimer and Gen. L.R.
Groves oversaw the first atomic explosion.
   It's a fascinating juxtaposition. The pioneers, for
example have lost their way; the Chinese, having suffered
unbearable hardships to complete the railroad, are about to
become expendable; the scientists on the eve of the first
detonation are wondering about the efficacy and ethics of
their efforts.
   The problem is that Ms. McLaughlin took the infinity in
her title too literally: The play goes on and on
interminably. Many vignettes are moving as well as
provocative, and there may be a powerful play lurking in her
narrative, but as it stands she has much too much material.
Watching the play is like living through a Thomas Wolfe novel
on stage. For those attending the festival the question
becomes how to judge such a play. For people who have
traveled a long distance to attend an important theater
festival, it takes considerable suspension of disbelief to
view the polished production on stage with the same
indulgence one might extend to an unfinished play.
   One trademark of the ATL Festival is a regional play -- a
"good ole boy" caper filled with down-home humor. This year's
entry is a "good ole gal" play with the unwieldy title of
"Zara Spook and Other Lures." Written by Joan
Ackermann-Blount, it is an interesting exercise in role
reversal. A group of women take off for a fishing contest in
the West, only to be pursued by their men, who feel deserted
and deprived of their company. Ms. Ackermann-Blount has a
true comic gift. In a discussion of schizophrenia one of her
characters remarks: "The way I see it, some folks got the
cookies and other folks got the jar."
   The second act needs serious trimming, but just as surely
as her heroine hauls in a prize-winning fish, Ms.
Ackermann-Blount has hold of a very funny play. As for Mr.
Jory and his colleagues at ATL, they may not know what they
have hold of, but there is nothing quite like it. Part
carnival, part new-play development, part international
conference, the festival is a one-of-a-kind theater
experience.
