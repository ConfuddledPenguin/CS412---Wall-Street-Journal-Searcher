   U.S. Shoe Corp., once known for its consistent growth and
sure-footed management, is anything but steady these days.
   Last week, U.S. Shoe said it discovered accounting
irregularities at a troubled shoe-import unit, forcing it to
take a $7.4 million charge. The company's outside accountants
are still investigating problems at the unit, but some former
executives and analysts believe the irregularities may extend
further within the company.

   "We simply don't know the depth of the problems in
footwear, but the write-off suggests that the problems are
deep," says Barry Bryant, a retail analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   The accounting disclosures come at a time when U.S. Shoe
is struggling to gain consistent profits in both its footwear
and women's apparel units. Moreover, the chief executive
officer who dominated the company for 25 years has just
stepped down, and his successor has no experience in either
of U.S. Shoe's traditional businesses.
   The accounting irregularities are the latest in a series
of puzzling incidents that have bewildered large
institutional investors, some of which have lost patience
with the company. In the past year, such large investors as
Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger Ltd. and Prudential
Insurance Company of America have cut their stake in the
company, and Fireman's Fund Corp. sold its 6.8% share.
   U.S. Shoe, based in Cincinnati, says that other investors
have been buying in, but the stock has fallen badly from its
1989 high of $27.50 a share, when the price was bid up during
an aborted leveraged buy-out of the company's footwear
division. The stock closed yesterday at $20.125, up 37.5
cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
down 87.5 cents a share since the company announced the
accounting irregularities last Thursday.
   "People don't understand what the problem is," one money
manager says. "This is a company where things keep going
wrong."
   Or unexplained. Last April, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Merrill
Lynch Capital Partners unit pulled out of the agreement to
acquire the footwear division in a $422.5 million leveraged
buy-out. Merrill Lynch never said why, but U.S. Shoe
attributed the pullout to jitters in the junk-bond market and
a huge drop in the footwear unit's fiscal first-quarter
operating earnings last year.
   Prior to the attempt to buy out the footwear unit, U.S.
Shoe failed last year to find a buyer for the entire company.
At that point it appeared that Philip G. Barach would
continue to lead the business he built from a little-known
shoe manufacturer to a $2.6 billion giant. But last month,
the hard-driving Mr. Barach stepped down as chief executive,
stunning friends and former colleagues.
   "I was shocked," says one former U.S. Shoe executive. "I
thought the only way he would leave would be in a box."
   The 59-year-old Mr. Barach, who retains his position as
chairman, insists he only wanted to lighten his workload and
spend more time with his family. Health was also a factor: He
had a heart attack 12 years ago and quadruple bypass surgery
seven years ago.
   Mr. Barach's unexpected resignation prompted speculation
that he was pressured to leave by restive investors or by
directors. As net income dropped to $13 million in fiscal
1988 from $65 million in 1985, some observers questioned
whether Mr. Barach should continue to run the company, which
makes more than 25 popular brands of shoes and operates
hundreds of specialty apparel and optical stores. Net income
rose to $49.2 million in the year ended Feb. 3.
   Mr. Barach, however, says he told the board in June of
1988 that he planned to step down this year and vigorously
denies anyone nudged him out.
   His successor, Bannus B. Hudson, is credited with building
U.S. Shoe's successful Lenscrafters unit into its most
profitable operation. But the speciality optical division
accounts for only about one-fifth of the company's sales. The
44-year-old Mr. Hudson, who has been with U.S. Shoe for four
years, has no experience in its main, and highly
unpredictable, businesses: women's apparel and footwear.
   "Do I have great experience as a merchant? Absolutely not,
but I bring several things to the party," Mr. Hudson says. He
spent 18 years at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in marketing and
manufacturing and will likely bring a more professional
management style to the company than Mr. Barach, whose
specialty was spotting retail trends.
   Mr. Hudson has inherited some tough problems, notably the
accounting investigation at the Marx &amp; Newman import unit.
Last week U.S. Shoe said it "terminated" the unit's chief
financial officer for "spurious bookkeeping entries" that it
said resulted in the $7.4 million charge. The company alleges
that the former official, Frank Paliotta, shifted sales from
one shoe brand to another, underestimated costs and
exaggerated sales figures by recording them after the
specified reporting period.
   But the company said it found no evidence that Mr.
Paliotta stole money or inventory from the company, and can
cite no motive for the alleged irregularities.
   In an interview from his New York home, Mr. Paliotta
denied he was fired and said it was the first he had heard
that the company was characterizing his departure as a
dismissal. He accused U.S. Shoe of using him as a scapegoat
for other problems at the division, based in Port Washington,
N.Y., which had losses of $13 million last year.
   Mr. Paliotta said he left the company four weeks ago after
his supervisors offered him another job because they were
unhappy with his performance.
   "U.S. Shoe didn't want me in that position, they offered
me another position and I didn't want it," says Mr. Paliotta,
who is still job hunting. "I think they're using me as a
scapegoat for all their problems." He declined to be
specific.
   Mr. Hudson said the investigation, conducted with its
accountants, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. during an annual audit, is
now focusing on factories in Italy and Spain that manufacture
its shoes, but he doesn't expect additional write-offs.
   The company took a one-time charge of 19 cents a share in
the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, 1989, partly because of the
sale of a shoe unit. In its first quarter of last year,
operating profit for the footwear division plunged 62% in
part because of "order cancellations resulting from late
deliveries of imported footwear," the company said.
   "You've had two charge-offs and one severe drop in
earnings in the past five quarters, all primarily related to
the footwear division," says Mr. Bryant, the retail analyst.
   U.S. Shoe's footwear division has been dogged by
speculation among analysts that its accounting and inventory
practices are lax. Mr. Bryant says the most recent write-off
at Marx &amp; Newman indicates that more accounting
irregularities might be found.
   "There is no direct evidence of fire, but the company has
been sending up clouds of smoke on a regular basis," Mr.
Bryant says.
   U.S. Shoe says that the investigation is focused
exclusively on Marx &amp; Newman and Arthur Andersen confirmed
that its audit didn't find any accounting irregularities
outside of the shoe-import unit. U.S. Shoe said it doesn't
expect further problems to be found.
   Despite the recent problems, Mr. Barach said the company
will announce at an analysts' meeting this afternoon that
U.S. Shoe is having an excellent first quarter. But the
company has already been hurt by the Marx &amp; Newman case. In
its fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, shoe division operating
earnings declined 37%, to $30 million, primarily due to
losses associated with the shoe-import unit.
   The company does have at least one star performer in the
footwear division. That's Easy Spirit, a comfortable women's
dress shoe introduced in 1987.
   U.S. Shoe also has to bring consistency to its women's
apparel division. The company's Casual Corner chain, a cash
cow in the 1970s, has fallen behind the Limited and the Gap
as a trend-setter, analysts note. Last year, the division
rebounded from a disastrous 1988, with operating profit
almost tripling to $53.2 million, but it still hasn't shown
the profit growth of top competitors.
   U.S. Shoe will also try to get as much mileage as possible
from its best player, Lenscrafters, which is to expand
overseas next year. In the U.S., the unit's annual sales
snowballed to $532 million in fiscal 1990 from $142 million
in fiscal 1986, and it continues to rack up equally
impressive profits.
   Perhaps Mr. Hudson's greatest challenge will be to put his
own stamp on the company that has so long been dominated by
Mr. Barach. It won't be easy. Mr. Barach, who has had many
run-ins with subordinates, will still be working at U.S. Shoe
as a "consultant" for the duration of his three-year
contract.
   "He's not been meddlesome or bothersome," Mr. Hudson says,
adding that he still recognizes how important Mr. Barach is
to the company. "I have the respect and support of Phil
Barach," he says, "and that's worth a great deal."
