   NEW YORK -- TVSM Inc., a publisher of cable-television
magazines, said it will merge with Crosby Vandenburgh Group,
also a major publisher of cable magazines.
   The merger of the two closely held companies will create
the country's largest publisher of magazines created
primarily for cable system operators and their subscribers.
As cable's penetration of U.S. television households
continues to grow, the cable magazines will be stiff
competition for established publications, such as News
Corp.'s TV Guide.

   The Boston-based Crosby Vandenburgh will merge its Cable
Publications Inc. division, which publishes the monthly
publication TV Entertainment, with TVSM, which publishes the
Cable Guide. The combined company will retain the TVSM name
and will continue to be run by Mark Edmiston, chairman of the
three-year-old TVSM.
   Terms of the merger weren't disclosed, but sources close
to the negotiation said investors in Crosby Vandenburgh were
offered stock in TVSM. Not involved in the merger is Custom
Magazines Inc., a division of Crosby Vandenburgh and
publisher of single-sponsor magazines.
   The merger was initiated by Frederick Iseman, a principal
of Hambro International Venture Fund, one of the investors in
Crosby Vandenburgh. "With 12 million circulation this makes
TVSM by far the dominant factor in cable publications," said
Mr. Iseman.
   Eventually it's expected TVSM will combine the two
magazines and publish it as one title on a weekly basis.
Already, TVSM is testing a weekly cable guide called TV Times
in San Diego and Huntington Beach, Calif., that tells
customers only what their cable system offers. TVSM said it
will launch this week a TV Time edition in Phoenix, Ariz. For
now, however, the magazines will be published separately.
   The merger is considered particularly attractive because
it gives TVSM a circulation of 12 million, all of it
unduplicated. Crosby Vandenburgh's TV Entertainment has a
circulation of about 4.5 million and is sent to subscribers
to cable systems owned by Tele-Communications Inc. TVSM's
Cable Guide has a circulation of about 7.5 million spread
among several major cable systems operators.
