   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's unemployment
rate fell to 7.7% of the labor force in March from 8.2% in
February, the Federal Labor Office said.
   The decline in unemployment to 2,013,057 in March was
slightly steeper than expected. An AP-Dow Jones survey of
West German economists had called for March unemployment to
be 7.8%.
