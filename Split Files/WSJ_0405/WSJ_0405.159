   BATON ROUGE, La. -- MMR Holding Corp. said Aetna Casualty
&amp; Surety Co. has agreed to assume the liabilities for MMR's
bonded contracts.
   The agreement appears to increase the amount of support
Aetna previously had said it would provide to MMR, a
mechanical and electrical contractor currently operating
under bankruptcy court protection from creditors. MMR said
Aetna also agreed to loan it $2.5 million, half of which
would bear a super priority lien for Aetna, which would give
Aetna priority over other MMR debts.

   Under the agreement, which is not yet final, MMR will
retain a 50% interest in the net future proceeds of its
substantially completed bonded jobs. MMR, its current
officers and directors and most of its subsidiaries would be
released from Aetna liabilities other than post
bankruptcy-petition loans Aetna made to MMR.
   Aetna also will fund MMR's bonded payroll for the week and
pay MMR proceeds ultimately derived on the completion of all
bonded contracts not now substantially complete.
   In a related move, MMR said its board elected William J.
Conway as chairman, president and chief executive officer.
The company said Mr. Conway, former president and chief
operating officer of Houston-based Raymond International Co.,
will assess the company's options and report his
recommendations to the board.
   Mr. Conway's election comes after a period of instability
in MMR's management and director ranks. The company's
chairman and chief executive and its chief financial officer
both resigned last month, apparently over policy differences
with directors. Days later, the president and newly named
chief executive resigned for "personal reasons." Then the
company said the former chairman, James B. Rutland, also
resigned as a director.
