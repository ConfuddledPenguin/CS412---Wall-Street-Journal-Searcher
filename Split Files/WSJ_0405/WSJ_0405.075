   It's hard to keep up on all the news these days. So in
case you've been concentrating on broccoli -- clearly a
front-page story every bit as important as Millie and her
pups -- let me tell you what the Supreme Court was up to last
week.
   It was up to no good.

   The court said, in effect, that political debate can
become one-sided and that states can censor it. It said
corporations, be they for-profit or not-for-profit, can be
barred from telling you what they think about a candidate,
and it will take no great leap to expand that thinking to
include causes and issues.
   The court said, in the words of dissenting Justice Antonin
Scalia, that "too much speech is an evil" that states can
stamp out.
   As the comedians say, I am not making this up.
   Here are the facts:
   In 1976, the state of Michigan passed a campaign-finance
law that said, among other things, that a corporation can't
use its general treasury funds to make so-called independent
expenditures in a political campaign. That means the
corporation can't, for instance, take out an ad or send out a
brochure endorsing or opposing this or that candidate.
   In 1985, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce decided that a
man named Richard Bandstra was the best candidate in a
special election in Grand Rapids to fill a seat in the state
house of representatives. The chamber proposed taking out an
advertisement talking about the need for Michigan to change
its workers'-compensation law and to lower its personal
income-tax rate. In that ad it proposed saying, "The State
Chamber is committed to job development in Michigan. We
believe Richard Bandstra shares that commitment."
   But the chamber, reading the 1976 law, decided maybe its
ad was illegal. So it sought to find out. A federal district
judge said yes, indeed, the ad was barred by the statute. The
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, saying the statute
violated the First Amendment. Then, last week, the Supreme
Court, in a 6-3 vote, reversed again, upholding the statute
and ignoring the Constitution.
   The opinion was written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, one
of the court's liberals, and was joined by Justice William J.
Brennan, the man liberals always look to to defend their
rights to speak or write or gather or pray. They were joined
by the court's moderates and Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
a man always ready to rein in the First Amendment. Opposing
the decision -- and thus favoring full rights of free speech
-- were Justices Scalia and Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day
O'Connor.
   Opposing, too, in friend-of-the-court briefs were such
disparate groups as the American Civil Liberties Union, the
American Medical Association, the National Association of
Realtors, Greenpeace Action, the Fund for the Feminist
Majority and the American Insurance Association. Clearly, a
lot of people were worried. And their worries turned out to
be well-founded.
   Justice Marshall, in the opinion, said it was OK to
squelch speech because there was "a compelling state
interest" -- preventing corruption or the appearance of
corruption in the political arena by reducing the threat that
huge corporate treasuries will be used to influence unfairly
election outcomes.
   This is absurd -- and dangerous.
   It's absurd because this is America, and America isn't
supposed to stifle the speech of man or corporation. (The
fact that corporations amass large treasuries does not
justify the suppression of political speech, Justice Scalia
wrote, "unless one thinks it would be lawful to prohibit men
and women whose net worth is above a certain figure from
endorsing political candidates.")
   It's absurd because money -- from political action
committees and others -- already plays a huge role in
American elections. It's absurd because censorship is a far
greater political sin than is overspending or even buying an
election.
   It's dangerous because it sets a new course, a course in
which a government can censor speech that simply has the
potential for causing harm, not speech (like Justice Holmes's
example of shouting fire in a crowded theater) that actually
causes harm.
   "Today's reversal of field will require adjustment of a
fairly large number of significant First Amendment holdings,"
Justice Scalia said in a dissent that he actually read from
the bench because he felt so strongly about the issue.
   "Presumably the State may now convict individuals for
selling books found to have a potentially harmful influence
on minors . . ., ban indecent telephone communications that
have the potential of reaching minors . . ., restrict the
press from publishing information that has the potential of
jeopardizing a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial . .
. and compel an applicant for bar membership to reveal her
political beliefs and affiliations to eliminate the potential
for subversive activity."
   Perhaps the bill has a noble objective, Mr. Scalia wrote.
"But government abridgement of liberty is always undertaken
with the very best of announced objectives (dictators promise
to bring order, not tyranny), and often with the very best of
genuinely intended objectives (zealous policemen conduct
unlawful searches in order to put dangerous felons behind
bars).
   "The premise of our Bill of Rights, however, is that there
are some things -- even some seemingly desirable things --
that government cannot be trusted to do. The very first of
these is establishing the restrictions upon speech that will
assure `fair' political debate."
   The theory behind the ruling is that corporations are
owned by their stockholders and those people might not want
the corporation to spend its money for political purposes.
   If that's the case, then it seems logical to rule, too,
that no executive -- whose pay comes from general corporate
funds -- can speak out in political debate. And no
stockholder can use his dividends for political purposes.
That, of course, is absurd, as absurd as last week's ruling.
   In a separate dissent, Justice Kennedy wrote: "With the
imprimatur of this Court, it is now a felony in Michigan for
the Sierra Club, or the American Civil Liberties Union, or
the Michigan State Chamber of Commerce, to advise the public
how a candidate voted on issues of urgent concern to their
members. In both practice and theory, the prohibition aims at
the heart of political debate."
   Twenty states have laws similar to Michigan's. So, in
about half this nation, we now have what Justice Kennedy
calls "the rawest form of censorship: the state censors what
a particular segment of the political community might say
with regard to candidates who stand for election."
   Any kind of censorship is dreadful. But censorship of
political talk is the worst of all. And as of last week,
that's what we have in the United States.
