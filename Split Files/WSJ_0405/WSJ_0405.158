   {Not all problems addressed by people in business are
problems of the marketplace. With little fanfare and often
with no motive of personal benefit, men and women in
companies big and small reach out every day to help others in
need. For some, it's a religious or moral commitment; for
others, a utilitarian creed that says helping the community
is good for business.
   The problems thus tackled are immense: poverty, drugs,
illiteracy, incurable disease, and others. The solutions
offered, by comparison, seem small. But what sets these
private-sector samaritans apart is that they persevere. Some
find frustration and even failure. But others succeed and, by
effective and sometimes innovative individual actions, point
the way for others to help as well.

more than the bottom line.

   THE BRONX HIGH SCHOOL Irving Kahn remembers was a place
where teachers taught, students learned and seniors graduated
with a fair idea of what their future held.
   Today, Mr. Kahn, a member of the DeWitt Clinton High
School Class of 1923, has few illusions about public-school
life in New York, where 30% of high school students drop out
before graduation. These young people need help, and the
stocky, energetic 85-year-old Mr. Kahn, now winding down a
career as chairman of a family-owned investment firm, figures
he's the one to provide it.
   Since 1986, he has presided over the New York City Job and
Career Center, a non-profit concern he created that is aimed
at showing high school students how to prepare for, and find,
a job. A second counseling center opened last fall in
Brooklyn, and Mr. Kahn is pressing to open two more.
   Behind his efforts is a personal belief that an
ill-prepared and unmotivated work force will drive more
employers from New York City, thus diminishing prospects for
financial-services firms like his. But Mr. Kahn is also
struck by how little personal contact exists between today's
high school students and their embattled teachers.
   "When I was a student at DeWitt Clinton, there were
teachers I could talk to about my future," recalls Mr. Kahn.
"Now there are too many students -- including a large number
of minorities with language or environmental disadvantages --
for the present teachers to counsel."
   Mr. Kahn devotes about a quarter of his workweek to the
job-counseling project and pays the salaries of the Manhattan
center's executive director and two assistants from his own
pocket. The other five staffers there are paid by the state,
which provides the quarters. Corporate donations and
foundation grants supplement the budget.
   Every weekday morning during the school year, small groups
of city high school students are escorted into the center's
offices for intensive drill in the basics of finding a job.
When applying for work, they're told, make eye contact with
the interviewer, sit up straight, leave the flashy jewelry at
home, don't mumble. A mock interview before a TV camera
follows, with each would-be applicant critiqued by peers
watching on a monitor.
   With the help of questions on a computer screen, students
also get guidance on what kind of work they should seek. The
first responses aren't always encouraging. "Actor" is the
most popular choice of 450 listed careers, center staff
members say, because many youngsters see the stage or screen
as a fast ticket out of the ghetto.
   The success of Mr. Kahn's centers is hard to gauge: No
measure of the number of permanent jobs landed by the
attendees has been taken, although officials say that of the
11,600 who visited last year, 1,587 applied for part-time,
after-school work as clerks, messengers and other entry-level
positions.
