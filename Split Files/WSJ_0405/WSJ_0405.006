   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's consumer price index rose 0.74%
in March from February and was up 3.3% from a year earlier,
according to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics.
   The directorate attributed March's increase in part to
higher prices for food and rental fees. Food prices gained
1.94% and rental fees climbed 0.35%.

   The impact of the boosts, however, was lessened somewhat
by a 1.2% drop in clothing prices.
