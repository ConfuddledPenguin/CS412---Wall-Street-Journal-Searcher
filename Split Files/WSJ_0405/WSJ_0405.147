   ADAC Laboratories said it expects to report substantially
lower revenue and earnings for its second quarter ended April
1, compared with the year-ago period.
   In the year-earlier second quarter, Milpitas, Calif.-based
ADAC posted net income of $4.1 million, or nine cents a
share, on revenue of $24 million. ADAC said earnings for the
most recent second quarter were near break-even. Revenue was
more than the $17.4 million posted in the first quarter.

   The company also said it "no longer believes" that sales
or earnings this fiscal year will increase over last. In the
last fiscal year, ADAC posted net income of $17.1 million, or
39 cents a share, on revenue of $98.1 million.
   ADAC sells medical imaging equipment. The company blamed
its lower results on increased competition and on its
customers' "restrictive capital equipment budgets."
