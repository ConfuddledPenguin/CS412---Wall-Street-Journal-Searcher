   NEW YORK -- Auction fever is hitting the publishing
industry once again, with two big-name novelists commanding
millions for books they haven't written yet.
   According to publishing executives, a division of Bantam
Doubleday Dell Publishing Group agreed this week to pay more
than $12 million in a ferociously competitive auction for two
novels by Ken Follett, author of the best sellers "Eye of the
Needle" and "The Key to Rebecca." And British novelist
Jeffrey Archer, who wrote "Kane &amp; Abel," is expected to
announce today that he will receive a total of more than $20
million for his next three books.

   Word of the two transactions is sending a shock wave
through the publishing industry, where a number of companies
have been forced to write off the extravagant advances paid
to writers in past seasons. Just last fall, publishers vowed
that they wouldn't continue to pay huge advances to authors,
and literary agents reported that many authors were getting
lower offers than in recent years.
   "It was just wishful thinking that outrageous advances
were a thing of the past," said Phyllis Grann, president of
Putnam Berkley Group Inc., which publishes many best-selling
authors. "To me this is a very significant week in the
industry." Added the head of another major publisher: "This
is beyond irresponsible, beyond mathematics. This is like
throwing bundles of money out the window, and it's very
unhealthy for the industry."
   Carole Baron, president and publisher of Delacorte/Dell,
the division of West Germany's Bertelsmann AG that bought the
two Follett novels, declined to confirm the $12 million-plus
figure. She said the sum paid includes rights for the U.S.
and Canada and hardcover and paperback rights. "This is about
names that absolutely, positively deliver, making the
bestseller lists for both hardcover and paperback," said Ms.
Baron. "I think I made a prudent investment."
   Delacorte/Dell publishes such big names as Danielle Steel,
Belva Plain and Elmore Leonard, and it just had an unexpected
hit with a novel based on the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"
movie that sold more than two million paperback copies. But
"we don't have anybody quite like Ken Follett," said Ms.
Baron.
   Mr. Follett still has another novel to complete under a
contract to Hearst Corp.'s William Morrow &amp; Co. for hardcover
and British paperback publisher Penguin Books, both of which
dropped out of this week's auction. The $12 million "is
considerably more than we offered, but we won't know for
years who is right," said Peter Mayer, chief executive
officer of International Penguin Group, parent of Penguin
Books. "One can say that Ken Follett will have to sell a
great many more copies than he has sold in the past." By one
estimate, Mr. Follett's next publisher will have to sell
350,000 hardcover copies and more than two million paperbacks
of each novel, just to break even.
   Mr. Archer, reached in London, said "I think it's common
knowledge there was a pre-emptive bid six or eight weeks ago
for $20 million {for two novels and a book of short stories},
which I rejected." Mr. Archer wouldn't say which publisher
had made the offer or why he rejected it, but he confirmed
that an auction of his books is scheduled to conclude today.
   Jack Romanos, president of mass market publishing for the
Simon &amp; Schuster division of Paramount Communications Inc.,
said Simon &amp; Schuster, which has been Mr. Archer's publisher
in hardcover and paperback, had an option to acquire his next
book. "But we weren't willing to come up to the level of
advance he was looking for," said Mr. Romanos. "He is similar
to Follett in that his greatest success, "Kane &amp; Abel," was
about 10 years ago. From my perspective, you've got people
willing to pay in 1990 for something that happened in 1980."
   While these newest mega-advances are shocking the
industry, they don't break the record. Novelist Stephen King
has reportedly received advances of $30 million for his next
three books. But then, say publishing insiders, Mr. King
routinely sells more than one million copies in hardcover and
may be the only writer around who can demand that much money
and still leave his publisher with a profit.
