   George Shultz once observed that "trust is the coin of the
realm." In Washington over the past several decades, that
coin has lost substantial value. George Bush's decision to
wedge the door open on tax increases could reduce the coin's
value further, diminishing trust in him, in Republicans, and
in Democrats generally.
   On first glance, pollsters' findings on American attitudes
to taxes seem to be wildly contradictory. In one recent poll,
for example, 71% of Americans said government spending should
be frozen. In another, more than six in 10 said more money
should be spent on domestic programs. Some contradictions
reflect longstanding ambivalence about taxes and services.
Others reflect vague choices presented to respondents. Still
others reflect low levels of public knowledge -- in areas
such as capital-gains taxes.

   It is worthwhile to take a moment to sort through the
contradictions, because there are some powerful currents in
this river of data. First, Americans want a lot from
government. We are a rich and powerful country, and want
government to do many things. We recognize these cost money.
But we believe that the price we are paying for government
services is too great and that our taxes are excessively
high. This is true nationally, and in states from California
to Massachusetts.
   To cite only two recent polls: in Connecticut, 70% said
the level of state taxes was "too high"; in Illinois, a solid
majority felt that the 1989 individual and corporate income
tax increase should be repealed. California's Prop 111
doubled the state's low gas tax to pay for infrastructure.
But citizens' 52%-to-48% passage of the proposition does not
represent a fundamental re-evaluation of taxes. A designated
tax to remedy a specific problem is generally more acceptable
than a general one that feeds government's appetite.
Politicians cannot go to this "designated tax" well too
often, lest already low public confidence diminish.
   The "hold the line" mood on taxes is shared by Americans
across the board. Their attitudes stem from the view that
government doesn't spend wisely. In a recent ABC
News/Washington Post poll, Americans said that nearly half of
each dollar -- 46 cents -- that government collects in taxes
is wasted. In Massachusetts, respondents told KRC/Boston
Globe pollsters that they disagreed with Michael Dukakis when
he said state taxes needed to be raised because all spending
cuts that could be made had been made.
   Why, then, do majorities say that they want to spend more
money -- and taxes -- on a whole variety of programs? First,
genuine concern about the less fortunate exists and so, too,
does concern about problem areas such as crime, drugs and
education. But spending questions are rarely asked
cumulatively, so we have no realistic idea of how much
Americans feel they can bear. A question asked in isolation
produces a generous response; a series of questions adding up
the costs produces a more cautious one. In an innovative
effort to remedy this polling deficiency, researchers at the
Public Agenda Foundation conducted three-hour interviews with
545 Americans about six social welfare programs.
Significantly, only a minority of Americans showed
willingness to pay more than $25 a year for any of the
programs surveyed (each costing from about $25 to $120 per
person per year).
   Voters are telling leaders to do more -- but not
necessarily to spend more. ABC News/Washington Post polling
showed a drop this spring in support for spending on the
homeless -- even though neither the plight of the homeless
nor Americans' desire to help had changed.
   There are several lessons here for politicians. Both
Democrats and Republicans have much to gain by holding the
line on taxes, but the nature of the gain is different. Today
the country is at rough parity in party identification -- in
1980, more Americans were Democrats, but, as the decade
passed, many switched to the Republican Party for economic
reasons. In 1980, the GOP led the Democrats as the party
Americans saw as better able to control government spending
by a stunning 56 percentage points (72% to 16%) in Wirthlin
Group data. The gap has narrowed to eight points, and could
narrow more. Democrats are seen as "too quick to support tax
increases" by 56% of Americans and 45% of Democrats, in a
Time/Yankelovich poll. Democrats need to dispel that image.
   George Bush may not suffer in opinion polls immediately.
Nor is it likely that many representatives will lose seats
this year as a result of a tax switch -- the voter tendency
to re-elect incumbents is too strong. But more visible Senate
or gubernatorial candidates might be affected. For both
parties, the long-term consequences are serious.
   Another potential consequence of a tax increase is a
further erosion of trust in government. The link between
taxes and trust is hard to define. But for nearly two
decades, polls have told us that Americans believe their
leaders in Washington aren't performing well. In the 1988
campaign, Americans told pollsters that they would be more
worried about a politician who goes too far in increasing
government's role (52%) than about one who goes too far in
cutting back (37%). When George Bush took office, only 24% of
Americans said he could "avoid raising taxes." By this
February, 54% said he could. That was the largest gain in
this Gallup Poll series -- 30 percentage points. Mr. Bush was
making good on a promise -- something that doesn't happen
very often in Washington. Now he may be breaking it.
   Politicians err when they ignore this trust. Even if
Americans rarely see a price tag, they know intuitively that
they will pay for new spending. Only 9% in a Gallup poll felt
the government would be able to reduce its spending. They are
generous, but they simply can't afford to be as generous as
politicians think they should be. What politicians need to
say is that we have a big government and want a big
government, but that right now the size and cost should get
no bigger.
