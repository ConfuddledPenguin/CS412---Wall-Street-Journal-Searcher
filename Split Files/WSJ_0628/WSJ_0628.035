   HOBOKEN, N.J. -- General Foods USA said it will phase out
operations at its Maxwell House Coffee plant here, a move
affecting 600 workers, by early 1992.
   Raymond G. Viault, president of Maxwell House, said the
plant would be closed to "eliminate a costly excess in
processing capacity," reflecting a 24% decline in coffee
comsumption in the United States since 1963.

   General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., operates four
coffee plants in the U.S., but said only 55% of the capacity
is needed.
   The Hoboken plant, which roasts and grinds coffee, was
built in 1939. Maxwell House also has plants in Jacksonville,
Fla., Houston, and San Leandro, Calif.
   A General Foods spokeswoman said the decision was made to
close the plant because "both short term and long term, our
production costs in Jacksonville were going to be lower than
in Hoboken."
   The plant's operations will be gradually phased out. Mr.
Viault said the company will try to match as many employees
as possible with job openings elsewhere in Maxwell House,
Kraft General Foods and Philip Morris. The company also will
offer training and assistance in job searches.
   Hoboken officials have offered tax cuts, and the union
representing workers at the plant offered other incentives in
efforts to keep the plant open. Some have estimated that up
to 2,500 jobs in the area are dependent upon the plant.
Neither Hoboken nor union officials could be reached for
comment.
   After several years of disappointing results, Kraft
General Foods's Maxwell House brand of coffee has gained
strength recently, according to food industry analysts. With
34.5% of the domestic market for ground roast coffee, the
brand is locked in a fierce competition for the industry's
No. 1 slot with Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Folger's brand.
   Michael Miles, chief executive of Kraft General Foods,
attributed the improvement to the introduction of new coffee
blends and increased ad spending.
