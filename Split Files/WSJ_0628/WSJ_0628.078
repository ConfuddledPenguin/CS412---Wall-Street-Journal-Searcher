   TORONTO -- Michael DeGroote, founder and chairman of
Laidlaw Inc., said he plans to step down as chief executive
officer Aug. 1 and to resign as chairman at year end to
devote more time to personal matters.
   The announcement surprised analysts and investors. More
than six million shares changed hands in trading on the
Toronto Stock Exchange and in over-the-counter trading in New
York. Laidlaw's Class B shares closed at $21.75, down 37.5
cents in hectic over-the-counter trading.

   "This is the first change in succession we've seen at
Laidlaw," said Steve Garmaise, vice-president of
Toronto-based First Marathon Securities Ltd.
   Mr. DeGroote sold his 47.2% voting stake and effective
control of Laidlaw to Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd. in
1988. That move led many industry analysts to assume he would
step down, at least as chief executive, within the next five
years.
   "But it wasn't expected that Mr. DeGroote would get out
this soon or this completely," Mr. Garmaise said. "People
thought he would still play an active role in determining
strategy and ferreting out acquisitions. So the market is
kind of spooked."
   Mr. Garmaise and some other analysts said they had
expected Laidlaw's stock to rise by as much as $1 yesterday
following an announcement that the company's net income for
the nine months ended May 31 rose nearly 40% to $194.8
million, or 81 cents a share, from $139.6 million, or 68
cents a share, a year earlier.
   "So while the market reaction may seem mild, this news has
not only kept the stock from rising, but has actually pushed
it down," Mr. Garmaise said.
   Laidlaw didn't say who would succeed Mr. DeGroote as
chairman and chief executive, but the company said Donald
Jackson, recently appointed president of the transportation
and waste management concern, will take over responsibility
for day-to-day operations.
   Ivan Cairns, vice president and general counsel, said the
company's board was advised of Mr. DeGroote's resignation
late Tuesday.
   "Mr. Jackson will be running the company, whether he is
eventually appointed chief executive or not," Mr. Cairns
said, adding that the company "has no intent of looking
outside" for someone to fill the chief executive position.
   Mr. Cairns said he expects directors will "take their
time" before announcing a chairman.
   Mr. Jackson joined Laidlaw in August 1989 as executive
vice president. He was appointed president in November.
   "This move clearly indicates that Laidlaw is moving to
further de-emphasize transport and stress the waste
management side of the business," said First Marathon's Mr.
Garmaise.
   Mr. Cairns said Mr. Jackson worked for Calgary-based
Trimac Ltd. for several years and served as chairman of
Trimac's chemical waste disposal unit, Tricil Ltd., which
Laidlaw acquired in November.
   Neither Mr. DeGroote nor Mr. Jackson could be reached for
comment.
