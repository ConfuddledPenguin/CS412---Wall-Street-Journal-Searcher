   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee approved a bill designed to standardize regulation
of pesticide residues in raw and processed food.
   The measure, approved by voice vote, would establish a
tolerance level under which pesticide residues would be
allowed as long as they wouldn't expose a person to a greater
lifetime cancer risk than one in a million.

   This would eliminate the so-called Delaney paradox. Under
the Delaney clause, which applies to processed food, a
chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals.
Under other laws applying to pesticide use, however, that
same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it
fell within the Environmental Protection Agency's tolerance
level.
   Although the bill was approved, lawmakers are continuing
to discuss modifications with the Bush administration and
hope to work out a compromise before the measure reaches the
floor. Among possible changes are whether to allow health or
economic factors to be taken into account when deciding
whether to allow pesticide use and whether to let federal
rules override state standards.
   In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee hasn't yet
taken up a similar bill.
