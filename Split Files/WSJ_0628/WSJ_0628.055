   Just before Easter, as people all over Greece headed to
their home villages or the seashore, jamming roadways, ports
and airports, thieves broke into the Archaeological Museum of
Ancient Corinth. Around 3 a.m., several persons attacked the
solitary 62-year-old night watchman and left him beaten,
bound and gagged. Before the day shift arrived to discover
the crime, the thieves had removed 271 objects -- many works
of Ancient Corinthian pottery; other ceramic works ranging
from the Geometric period to Attic black-figured and
red-figured vases, glass vases and sculpture, including a a
male Kourostype head from about 470 B.C.; and works dating
from Corinth's Roman period. Along with the antiquities, the
burglars took one million drachmas (about $6,100) in cash,
representing two weeks of staff wages and entrance fees from
foreign visitors.
   The thieves used a ladder purchased locally to reach the
museum's roof and descend into the courtyard. Having gathered
their loot, the gang tried without success to exit through
the heavy metal front door. They abandoned their tools,
climbed back up the ladder and then left it behind, covered
with fingerprints.

   From his hospital bed, the guard said two of the men wore
hoods, that they spoke Greek and used walkie-talkies to
communicate with unseen accomplices. Authorities were
immediately notified, border guards alerted, and a huge
nationwide search for the perpetrators began.
   The theft is believed to be the largest ever of Greek
antiquities, and the Greek press suggests that plunderers of
archaeological sites recently have added museums to their hit
lists. Very few thefts from Greece are reported to Interpol
or to the International Foundation for Art Research, but
following the Corinth theft, Greek newspapers reported that
an alarming number of incidents, 231, occurred in the last
six months alone. The most important was a robbery in
November 1989 at the Archaeological Museum housed in the
Hospital of the Knights in Rhodes, where thieves also
disabled a night watchman and entered via the roof. Their
booty consisted largely of Mycenaean gold and jewelry.
   Although connoisseurs might dismiss many of the Corinth
items as of only mediocre artistic quality, the theft is a
terrible loss to archaeology. The excavations at Ancient
Corinth have operated continuously since 1896 under the aegis
of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The
school is the largest of the foreign archaeological
institutes in Greece, and since its founding in 1881 it has
been a home for students and faculty from 153 North American
colleges and universities who have used its libraries and
participated in its excavations. Excavations have unearthed a
Greek agora, a temple to Apollo, fountains and, from Roman
times, several small temples and a large amphitheater. The
American School built the museum in 1931 and enlarged it in
1958, but the collections and the museum and its contents are
the property of the Greek government.
   The Ministry of Culture, under its newly appointed head,
Tzannis Tzannetakis, issued a statement pledging to reinforce
museum security. As a rule, smaller museums in Greece have
few security guards during hours of opening and just one
watchman at night; electronic alarm systems are rare.
Skeptics have been quick to challenge the ministry to
activate those alarm systems that do exist to test which ones
would actually work and to see whether the police would
respond.
   The objects stolen at Corinth all were excavated and
studied, and many have been included in scholarly
publications, including the school's journal, Hesperia.
Should they be recovered, identification will not be a
problem since all the objects were photographed and properly
recorded, and each piece is marked indelibly to identify it.
   The city of Ancient Corinth, slightly inland from the
modern center, dates from Homeric times and became a maritime
power as early as the seventh century B.C. Early painted
pottery from Corinth was popular and has been found
throughout the Mediterranean. The city's artists also were
known for their bronzes, but most of them were melted down,
especially after Corinth was sacked in 146 B.C. by a Roman
army under Gen. Achaicus Lucius Mummius. Julius Caesar
restored the city about a century later.
   Corinth also was notorious as a city of pleasure, a sort
of ancient Las Vegas famed for its prostitutes and other
costly diversions. On the cliff above the ancient city,
archaeologists have excavated the remains of a temple to
Aphrodite, the goddess of love. Aristophanes is credited with
coining the verb "to Corinth," meaning to prostitute oneself.
Even in the 16th century, when Hans Holbein the Younger
painted a portrait of his mistress, Magdalena Offenburg, he
depicted her as a courtesan, "Lais of Corinth."
