   The accelerating economic collapse of the Soviet Union
presents an unprecedented opportunity for the U.S. and its
allies to obtain a major reduction in Soviet military
capacity in exchange for massive economic aid. At the Houston
summit meeting, President Bush and the other Western leaders
should agree on a general strategy for tying any economic aid
for the Soviets to a reduction of Soviet arms.
   The alternative approaches that are now being considered
-- giving aid without any strings attached or conditioning it
only on such things as Soviet economic reforms and relations
with Lithuania -- would miss a major opportunity to improve
the prospects for world peace. So too would a decision simply
to deny aid and therefore pass up the chance to trade Western
consumer goods for Soviet military cuts.

   Although the recent Washington summit meeting between
President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev exuded warm feelings, it
did little to reduce the Soviet military threat. Even after
the agreed arms reductions, the Soviets will still have
massive destructive strength, including more than 5,000
ballistic missiles and 2,000 strategic bomber weapons. Mr.
Gorbachev and the other Soviet negotiators have been
unwilling to accept further cuts in strategic weapons or to
resolve the threat of conventional armed forces in Europe.
   The obvious lesson is that the Soviet Union is not
prepared to give up substantial additional offensive military
capacity in exchange for parallel military reductions by the
U.S. The Soviet leadership has presumably concluded that the
risk that the U.S. or NATO will attack the Soviet Union is
extremely low. Since reducing that risk further is of little
value to the Soviets, they are unwilling to make significant
further military concessions in exchange.
   What the Soviets really want is not reduced U.S. military
capacity but current consumer goods and access to the
technology, the advice and the investments that will permit
them to develop a Western standard of living. It is a
mistake, therefore, to limit arms negotiations to military
trade-offs alone. More generally, it is wrong to regard the
Soviet Union in arms negotiations as a power like the U.S.
when, despite its formidable military capacity, its economy
is on the verge of collapse. The proper focus for U.S.
negotiations with the Soviet Union should now be on trading
American consumer goods and know-how for Soviet military
reductions.
   This proposal to trade economic assistance for arms
reductions is very different from the call for unilateral
Western aid modeled on the Marshall Plan. The advocates of
such aid -- like French President Francois Mitterrand and
many others in Europe and the U.S. -- point to the success of
the Marshall plan in securing economic growth and democracy,
not only in the countries of Western Europe that had been our
allies in World War II but also in the defeated Germany. They
argue, moreover, that the recent collapse of the Warsaw Pact
and the Soviet recognition that the communist economic system
has failed now represent a psychological defeat for the
Soviet Union that could lead to the same kind of poisoned
atmosphere in the Soviet Union that prevailed in Weimar
Germany after World War I but that was avoided by the
Marshall Plan aid to Germany after the Second World War.
   American opponents of aid to the Soviet Union rightly
stress that the Soviet situation today is very different from
that in Europe after World War II. The Soviets lack the
tradition of capitalism that made the Marshall Plan so
successful in Western Europe. Even more important, although
the Soviet Union may appear on the surface like a defeated
enemy, there has been nothing analogous to Germany's
unconditional surrender. The Soviet Union is still a
formidable military adversary with massive nuclear
destructive capacity.
   Of course, that is a case against unconditional economic
assistance to the Soviet Union or assistance conditioned only
on economic and political actions by the Soviets. It is not a
case against using economic assistance as a way of getting
the Soviets to accept a reduction of their relative military
strength.
   Similarly, the argument that Western economic assistance
may not help the Soviets to reform their economy is not
relevant if the Soviets will accept such aid as an inducement
to reduce their military strength. Even if much of the aid is
wasted from an economic point of view, it will be valuable
for the U.S. if it achieves a better military balance.
   The American goal should be to secure as much of a
reduction in Soviet military strength -- particularly nuclear
weapons and intercontinental delivery capacity -- as possible
in exchange for our consumer goods and technical assistance.
The closer that the Soviets are prepared to get to complete
elimination of their offensive intercontinental nuclear
capacity, the more the U.S. should be prepared to give in
consumer goods and related technology.
   The U.S. has a clear and vital interest in reducing Soviet
military capacity, especially the ability to deliver a
nuclear attack on the U.S. The presumably peaceful intentions
of Mr. Gorbachev provide little comfort, since we cannot know
how long he will remain in a position of power or what kind
of individual will succeed him.
   There is also an increasing probability that the Soviet
Union itself will not survive the current decade but will
divide into a group of separate affiliated republics.
Advocates of national self-determination may cheer the notion
of separate governments for the Baltic states, for the
Ukraine, for Georgia, for Azerbaijan, and for the Russian
Republic. But who can help but be nervous about the prospect
that the nuclear weapons now spread around the Soviet Union
will no longer be controlled by a single Soviet government?
   Uncertainties about the future leadership of the Soviet
Union and about its very existence are the current basis of
America's very real interest in negotiating Soviet arms cuts.
These same concerns should support using economic aid to
achieve a reduced Soviet military capacity.
   Some opponents of economic aid to the Soviets argue that
the U.S. cannot afford substantial spending on such aid at a
time when large budget deficits persist and may become
increasingly difficult to finance because of a reduced
availability of capital from abroad. But after spending
trillions of dollars on defense in the past decade to achieve
military parity with the Soviets, it would now be foolish not
to spend a few tens of billions of dollars if that could buy
clear military superiority and a reduction in the overall
risk of military conflict.
   Moreover, if we do succeed in inducing the Soviets to
reduce their nuclear capability substantially, the U.S. could
reduce defense spending and still have a military
superiority. The more that the Soviets are willing to reduce
their international nuclear capability in exchange for
consumer goods and technical assistance, the more that the
U.S. can safely reduce its own military spending. To a
significant extent, consumer aid to the Soviet Union can thus
be self-financing through the reduced U.S. military spending
that it permits. Indeed, if consumer aid buys a large enough
reduction in Soviet military strength, the overall peace
dividend could even be larger than currently projected.
   The reduction in U.S. military spending will also make it
easier for the Soviet political leaders to persuade their own
military hierarchy to accept a cutback in Soviet military
spending. Although the real essence of the agreement is the
reduction of Soviet military spending in exchange for
American economic aid, wrapping these in the same package
with additional U.S. arms reductions will permit the Soviet
leaders to accept the proposal without the loss of face that
would be associated with reducing their military strength
unilaterally in exchange for economic assistance. From our
own point of view, the critical fact would be that the Soviet
military cutbacks would exceed our own, leading to U.S.
military superiority and greater global stability.
   A trade of Western economic assistance for Soviet arms
reductions should appeal to a broad political spectrum in the
U.S. and its allies. Supporters should include those who want
to assist the Soviets on humanitarian grounds, those who
believe that economic assistance will increase political
stability in the Soviet Union, those who want to increase
U.S. military strength relative to the Soviets by reducing
Soviet military capacity, and those who will welcome a
reduction in both U.S. and Soviet defense spending and
military capacity.
   There is of course no way to know how such an offer would
be received in the Soviet Union at this time. But the
collapse of the Soviet consumer economy and the internal
dissension that it is causing suggest that this is a good
time to present such an offer. Soviet economist Stanislav
Shatalin, recently appointed by President Gorbachev as a
member of his new presidential council, has stated
emphatically that the Soviet Union must run to the West for
massive economic assistance. And although it is still
publicly denied, Germany has apparently negotiated with the
Soviets a package of consumer assistance and credit aimed at
obtaining the Soviet Union's support of full German
participation in NATO and a timetable for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from East Germany.
   If in their current dire economic circumstances the
Soviets do not agree to scrap a substantial portion of their
offensive weapons in exchange for massive economic aid, that
would be a sad but useful indication that they are really not
serious about abandoning their old goals of military
conquest. If that is so, we should learn it as soon as
possible. But if there is a chance for trading our consumer
goods for greater military security, it is an opportunity
that should not be lost.
