   KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS Inc. directors declared a 3-for-2
stock split, payable July 23 to stock of record July 9. After
the split, the New York-based television program producer and
distributor will have slightly more than 38 million shares
outstanding. The split will boost shares outstanding and
lower the price. "We think {the stock is} an attractive
security for individual investors," a spokeswoman said. King
World's net income for the six months ended Feb. 28 grew 7.5%
to $51.4 million, or $1.98 a share, as revenue climbed 17% to
$270.7 million. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, King World shares rose 62.5 cents to $36.50.
