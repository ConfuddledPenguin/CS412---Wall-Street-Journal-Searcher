   BEI Electronics Inc., San Francisco, said a subsidiary is
under investigation by the Justice Department for allegedly
submitting inaccurate cost or pricing data on two government
contracts.
   The company, which makes electronics systems used in

also said it is conducting its own internal investigation of
the unit, BEI Defense Systems of Fort Worth, Texas, which has
stopped making the product in question.
