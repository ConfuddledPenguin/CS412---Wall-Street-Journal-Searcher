   WASHINGTON -- President Bush announced major trade,
investment and debt initiatives for Latin America.
   As proposed, the new U.S. policy envisions substantial
debt relief on the nearly $12 billion outstanding in U.S.
government credits to the region. It also would set aside as
much as $300 million a year in grants from a new fund
administered by the Inter-American Development Bank to foster
private investment, and it foresees an eventual free-trade
zone running the length and breadth of the Western
Hemisphere.

   "Throughout the region, nations are turning away from the
statist economic policies that stifle growth -- and are now
looking to the power of the free market to help this
hemisphere realize its untapped potential for progress,"
President Bush said in calling for "a new economic
partnership." Prosperity in the Western Hemisphere, he said,
"depends on trade, not aid."
   The new initiative, which the White House termed the
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, is an attempt to lift
Latin America off the rocks of economic stagnation, bolster
the region's recent move toward democracy, and provide
opportunities similar to those that are being offered to
Eastern Europe. But, as with U.S. efforts to aid Warsaw Pact
countries, the Bush Latin America initiative sets large goals
while pledging relatively small financial commitments, a
result of the great concern over the U.S. budget deficit.
   Moreover, to achieve success, the new approach will
require cooperation from the Latin American nations,
substantial backing from Congress as well as a strong
commitment from Europe and Japan.
   Still, the plan would represent a substantial change from
the Reagan years, when U.S. policy toward Latin America was
characterized primarily by support for the Nicaraguan Contras
and on managing, rather than reducing, the region's
overwhelming foreign debt burden.
   Latin American officials said Mr. Bush's proposals could
refocus world attention, which has been turned largely to the
upheavals in Eastern Europe, back on their region. "The
initiative makes the world think of Latin America, and Latin
America think of the world, particularly before the economic
summit in Houston," said Enrique Iglesias, the head of the
Inter-American Development Bank, a multilateral development
bank for the Western Hemisphere. Leaders of the Western
industrial nations are set to meet in Houston early next
month.
   On trade, Mr. Bush's plan has three elements. First, he
pledged the U.S. to "close cooperation" with Latin American
countries in the current Uruguay round of world trade talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Second, he said the U.S. is ready "to enter into free
trade agreements with other markets in Latin America and the
Caribbean -- particularly with groups of countries that have
associated for trade liberalization." The first step in this
process, he said, is a free trade agreement with Mexico. The
"ultimate aim," according to Mr. Bush, is "a free-trade
system that links all the Americas -- North, Central and
South" into a comprehensive free-trade area.
   Third, with countries that aren't ready for free-trade
agreements, the U.S. is prepared to negotiate closer trade
ties, Mr. Bush said.
   To boost investment, the president appealed to Latin
American countries to cut red tape and adopt regulations to
make it easier for international investors to put money into
the area. He also said the U.S. would contribute $100 million
annually to a proposed $300 million-a-year fund that would be
administered by the Inter-American Development Bank to
promote privatization and market-oriented reforms. The U.S.
intends to seek matching funds from Europe and Japan for the
fund, which the Treasury said would continue for five years.
   Mr. Bush proposed that the IADB join the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund in efforts to cut back
commercial bank debts and interest payments in the region.
But cutting back bank obligations hasn't helped some
countries in the region -- such as Honduras, El Salvador and
Jamaica -- that primarily owe money to foreign governments.
   Officials said the U.S. would propose substantial
write-offs -- in some cases more than 50% -- in the $7
billion outstanding in aid loans U.S. government agencies
have made at below-market rates to the most heavily burdened
countries. And they said the U.S. will sell a portion of its
$5 billion market-rate loans to help facilitate
debt-for-equity and debt-for-nature swaps. How much of the $5
billion would be sold wasn't disclosed.
   The officials said the administration is particularly
eager to help environmental programs, and in some cases will
let Latin American nations use local-currency interest
payments to pay for conservation projects.
   Still, Latin America's total official debt owed to the
U.S. is a small part of the region's $400 billion in foreign
debt.
   The administration's proposals seemed to be warmly
received. It's "a conceptually exciting and progressive
initiative appropriate for the economic conditions of the
1990s," said Richard Feinberg, executive vice president of
the Economic Development Council, a Washington-based private
think-tank that specializes in development issues.
   Bankers also liked the new U.S. government involvement in
debt relief and the proposals to jump-start the regional
economy. "This is the first time I've heard the U.S.
government focus on economic development in Latin America in
the regional sense and giving it the priority the president
gave it," said John Reed, chairman of Citicorp. "Official
debt reduction . . . is logical and positive," said Peter
McPherson, executive vice president at BankAmerica Corp. and
a former deputy secretary of the Treasury.
