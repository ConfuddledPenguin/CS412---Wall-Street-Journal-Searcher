   WASHINGTON -- NASA has found a fundamental defect in the
Hubble Space Telescope that will prevent the space agency's
$2.5 billion eye-in-the-sky -- the most expensive satellite
ever launched -- from performing many of its planned
scientific experiments.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it
discovered that one, or possibly both, of the orbital
telescope's mirrors, manufactured by General Motors Corp.'s
Hughes Danbury Optical Systems subsidiary, was flawed during
manufacturing, making the telescope myopic. The agency said
it didn't uncover the problem during years of testing on the
ground. Over the past two weeks, NASA said, it learned that
the mirrors couldn't focus properly in orbit and wouldn't be
able to take images of distant stars and galaxies.

   "It's a grim day for astronomy," said Maarten Schmidt, a
prominent California Institute of Technology astronomer.
   Edward Weiler, Hubble's program scientist, said that
astronomers wouldn't be able to use the telescope's
wide-field camera, the spacecraft's main scientific
instrument, for exploration and that they would have only
limited use of its high-resolution camera as well. The
wide-field camera accounted for 40% of the experiments
planned for Hubble during its first three years of
observations.
   The space telescope was launched April 24 by the space
shuttle Discovery. Astronomers had hoped it would help
resolve some of science's most fundamental questions and hunt
for such exotic phenomena as black holes and distant quasars.
But the spacecraft immediately ran into a host of engineering
problems that had the telescope aiming at the wrong stars,
shutting itself off and wobbling in orbit. NASA said it is on
its way to resolving those problems.
   But the mirror defect is far more serious because it
represents a fundamental flaw in the space hardware that
can't be fixed by changing software commands from Earth. Mr.
Weiler said that he hoped that a replacement camera, due to
be launched by the shuttle in about three years, would be
able to correct for the mirror's flaws -- comparable to
fitting the mirror with glasses. The mirrors, which are big
and fragile, weren't designed to be replaced. During the
first three-year period, Hubble would concentrate on making
observations of the ultraviolet radiation emitted by
celestial bodies, which are blocked by the Earth's
atmosphere, and obtaining data on the chemistry of these
objects.
   Mr. Schmidt said, however, that until Hubble is outfitted
with a new camera it won't be able to attempt to calculate
the size of the universe -- one of its chief objectives --
and would have a hard time hunting for planets around nearby
stars. Astronomers have never definitively identified a
planet outside this solar system. "There are many important
programs that can't be done or will be done with less
efficiency," he said.
   NASA said it believes the mirrors were designed properly
but were manufactured incorrectly because the surfaces
weren't properly measured. The agency said it is setting up a
board of inquiry headed by Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. Hughes Danbury, which made the
mirrors, also blamed measurement technology and said it is
setting up a review panel. A spokesman for the company said,
"If the problem is in the {shape} of the mirror, it wouldn't
be as if we had a set of data and produced to the wrong
specifications."
   One scientist involved in the Hubble program said the
optical equipment used to test the mirror may have been
flawed. He said tests conducted years ago apparently had
given results that the telescope's mirror was properly
formed, when in fact it wasn't.
   At the news conference, Jean Olivier, Hubble's deputy
project manager, offered two explanations of why NASA didn't
catch the problems before launch. First, he said, conducting
a test would cost "hundreds of millions of dollars" and thus
wasn't thought to be worth the money. Then, he said, existing
instruments could have caught the imperfections, but for some
reasons they weren't used to make the necessary measurements.
   The space telescope's problems may adversely affect
another mammoth telescope the space agency is building --
this one costs $1.5 billion and will measure X-ray
emanations. This year, Congress approved $44 million for
early work on the telescope, but required that the mirrors
meet rigorous specifications. Hubble's mirrors were over
budget and behind schedule, contributing to the project's $1
billion cost overrun and delay in launching.
