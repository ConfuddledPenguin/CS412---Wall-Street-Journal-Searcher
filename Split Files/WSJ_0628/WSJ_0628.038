   TLC Beatrice consists of Beatrice Cos.' former
international food operations. Those operations were taken
private in December 1987 by the investor, Reginald F. Lewis,
47 years old, who is TLC Beatrice's chairman, chief executive
officer and controlling stockholder.
   TLC Beatrice brought back Mr. Simeus from the company's
former Latin American operations, where Mr. Simeus had been
running the lines when the company sold them for more than
$100 million in June 1988.
