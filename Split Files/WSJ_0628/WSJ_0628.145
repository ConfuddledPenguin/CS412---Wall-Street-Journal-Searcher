   BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said
another Mideast war is "inevitable" unless the U.S. blocks
what he sees as aggressive policies by Israel to drive
Palestinians from their land and to dominate the Arab world.
   In his first interview with an American newspaper in
nearly six years, Mr. Hussein, who has a reputation for
brutality, spoke pointedly and unemotionally of his
determination to stand up to any Israeli aggression against
Arab countries, even if it means war. "We shall respond to an
Israeli attack whenever it comes and wherever," he said. "If
Israel attacks one country and there is no response, then the
second country to be attacked surely will be Iraq."

   His remarks come at a time when fears of a new Mideast war
are high. Those concerns have been stoked lately by the
formation of a new hardline government in Israel, continued
Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
President Bush's suspension last week of the U.S. dialogue
with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Jordan's King
Hussein, in an interview last weekend, likened the rising
tension to the hair-trigger period before the June 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   Both King Hussein and President Hussein believe the
Palestinian uprising in Israel and the wave of Soviet Jews
emigrating to the country have convinced Israel's government
that it must find a pretext to push Palestinians out of the
West Bank and into neighboring Jordan. Some of King Hussein's
ministers anxiously describe scenarios that could lead to
war, including an Israeli attack on either Jordan or Libya
followed by an Iraqi military response.
   For some months, the Iraqi president has been threatening
to "scorch half of Israel" with poison gas if it attacks
Iraq. At a distance, those claims sometimes sound like
hotheaded rhetoric. But up close, during a 3 1/2-hour
interview at his heavily guarded presidential palace, Mr.
Hussein spoke with almost clinical detachment of a war in
which Israeli nuclear weapons would be offset by Iraq's
chemical capability.
   As is usually the case with Saddam Hussein, security
during the interview was tight. Briefcases and purses aren't
allowed in his presence, and even ballpoint pens and notepads
are carefully scrutinized. The meeting was held in an ornate
marble room, where a bevy of presidential aides took notes
and two cameras filmed throughout. Mr. Hussein, a reclusive
man who hasn't traveled to the West in more than a decade,
revealed little about his private life. Asked how he relaxes,
the president, dressed in a gray business suit, appeared
genuinely surprised. "He's never been asked that before,"
explained his interpreter, while staff aides whispered that
he should say he goes fishing.
   In discussing the Mideast, Mr. Hussein was careful to
tread the line between toughness and outright aggressiveness.
While he called Israel an "evil entity" and termed the U.S.
"indifferent" to Mideast concerns, he stressed repeatedly
that Iraq will strike only if Israel strikes first.
   While all this war talk may be meant simply to goad the
U.S. into reassessing its Mideast policy, Saddam Hussein's
remarks can't be lightly dismissed. He possesses chemical
weapons -- he has used them before against Iranians and
dissident Iraqis -- and a brash self-confidence largely borne
of surviving his eight-year war with Iran. Furthermore, he
enjoys a freedom to act seemingly unchecked by any force
inside or outside Iraq, an oil-rich nation of 17 million he
has ruled since 1979. Finally, he possesses a million-man,
battle-hardened army and plenty of weapons; for the past five
years, Iraq has led the world in arms imports.
   Mr. Hussein insisted that future wars won't, as in the
past, lead to quick Israeli victories. "If Israel were to
conduct an aggression, then the confrontation must be long,"
he said. And, if the fighting is long, "the outcome will not
be one Israel desires." Asked how a long war is possible
given that Israel has nuclear weapons, he said, "Iraq is in
possession of binary chemical weapons. Our scientists and
military men calculate this is sufficient enough to deter an
Israeli nuclear attack."
   Whether right or wrong, both Saddam Hussein and King
Hussein appear to have convinced each other -- and want to
convince the U.S. -- that Israel is preparing to push the
remaining one million or so Palestinians into Jordan. Both
Arab leaders see Iraq as the best deterrent and the only real
defense should Israel attack. And both leaders insist the
U.S., and to a lesser extent Great Britain, are conducting a
campaign to smear Iraq and thus create international support
for an Israeli attack. "They opened fire," he claimed,
referring to the U.S. and Britain.
   A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said the
ministry couldn't comment on Mr. Hussein's remarks until it
had seen a full text. A spokesman for Israeli Defense
Minister Moshe Arens also declined to respond directly but
said, "Everybody knows that Israel has no aggressive
intentions toward the Arab world and is ready to negotiate
directly for peace. We pray every day we won't have a new war
in the Middle East."
   However far-fetched President Hussein's fears may seem,
the risk is that, either deliberately or inadvertently, Arab
leaders could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Jordan's
King Hussein, who was the Iraqi president's first and most
loyal supporter during the long Iraq-Iran war, seems to be
huddling even closer to him as Jordan's fears of Israel
mount. For instance, King Hussein refused in an interview to
rule out inviting Iraqi troops into his country. While his
intent would be protection against Israel, Iraq's soldiers in
Jordan almost certainly would be seen by Israel as a
provocation.
   Israel's new government has fanned Arab fears by issuing
policy guidelines which state that the government "will place
immigration and absorption {of immigrants} foremost among its
national objectives." Arabs are further aroused by the
declaration that, "The eternal right of the Jewish people to
Eretz Yisrael is not subject to question, and is intertwined
with its right to security and peace." Eretz Yisrael is
generally seen to include both Israel and the West Bank
occupied by Israel since its victory in the 1967 war.
   "If they've prepared such a scheme, then aggression must
occur," the Iraqi president said. "You cannot avoid war."
   Indeed, there is little talk anywhere in the region of a
peace process, particularly since President Bush suspended
talks with the PLO. The U.S. action was taken after
Palestinian guerrillas launched an unsuccessful raid on the
Israeli coast last month.
   Whatever comes, Saddam Hussein is the Arab leader to
watch. Throughout the interview, he answered questions
patiently, including those about his international reputation
as the "Butcher of Baghdad." His reply: "Weakness doesn't
assure achieving the objectives required by a leader."
   Mr. Hussein's suspicion of the U.S. is always evident. He
called on the Bush administration to withdraw U.S. ships from
the Persian Gulf, arguing they no longer are needed to
protect oil tankers from Iranian aggression. Therefore, he
believes, they must either be spying for Israel or perhaps
planning to provoke a new Iraq-Iran naval confrontation to
tie up Iraqi forces.
   In Washington, a State Department official dismissed Mr.
Hussein's allegations and said U.S. ships are in the Persian
Gulf because of "vital U.S. interests that we have in the
waterways of the Gulf," and not to stir up trouble between
Iran and Iraq. He added that the U.S. has been "very
involved" in working for peace in the region.
   Mr. Hussein also kept open the possibility of using an oil
embargo as a weapon, though today's glutted market would
limit its immediate effectiveness. After Saudi Arabia, Iraq
possesses the world's largest oil reserves. Only the U.S.,
the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia have greater production
capacity.
   "We do not want to use the oil weapon unless forced to do
so in defense of our rights and interests," he said. But,
citing the U.S. and Britain's seizure this spring of large
pipes destined for Iraq and believed intended for
construction of a "big gun" capable of lobbing missiles long
distances, he added, "If the great powers use any opportunity
they see available to suppress others and to reap benefits at
others' expense, then the others will find themselves in a
position that will force them to use any means available."
   As Saddam Hussein sees it, the easing of tensions between
Soviets and Americans has heightened Arab unity, for Arab
nations are no longer divided between two superpower camps.
He said the Cold War's end has also increased America's sense
that it can dictate Mideast policy. "It is now clear the U.S.
can exert influence over the Soviets and make them abandon
any position contrary to the U.S.," he said. "So, America
thinks it can cast things anyway it wants in the region and
in alliance with Israel can suppress any voice in support of
Arab rights."
   But the president's primary point is that the world --
especially the U.S., Britain and Israel -- is misjudging and
underestimating Iraq. Other countries' assessment, he
insisted, is that Iraq's economy, people and leaders are too
exhausted from eight years of fighting Iran to "indulge in a
new war." Furthermore, he said, these nations fear that Iraq,
absent war, will develop into a powerful example of political
and economic independence that other Arabs could emulate.
"The way we see it, they thought this is the time and not any
other when the assault against Iraq must be made."
   He added, "Their assessment is totally wrong. This does
not mean the people of Iraq do not want peace. But people who
fought for eight years know the value of peace." Thus, he
said, it is only "natural such people reject expansionism,
reject hegemony and reject capitulation."
   Both Jordan and Iraq seem genuinely to feel vulnerable
now, though for somewhat different reasons. Jordan, which
held free elections this year, now faces a parliament where
one third of the seats are held by fundamentalists, some of
whom profess to see war as the only way to deal with Israel.
So, Jordan is under internal pressure to stand tough against
Israel. At the same time, officials fear external aggression
from Israel. Trapped between these two pressures, the
Jordanian monarchy appears to fear for its existence. A bad
economy has made discontent even worse.
   For its part, Iraq's president and other officials appear
to have convinced themselves the world is conspiring against
them. British and U.S. diplomats are combing the Gulf nations
warning rulers to fear Iraq, the president claimed. (The
State Department denied the claim.) He declined to say
whether the shipment of 132-foot long pipe seized by British
and American customs agents was indeed intended for creation
of an Iraqi "big gun." If so, he said, the gun wouldn't have
as long a range as missiles already in Israel's possession
and, he argued, Iraq has the right to weapons equal to those
in Israel's arsenal. So, why not disclose plans for the gun
if they exist? "I leave it to your speculation," he said.
   He was similarly coy about any Iraqi nuclear weapons
program. Referring to the French nuclear reactor Israeli jets
destroyed in 198l, he said, "It has neither been our program
nor is it now our program to use these reactors for military
purposes." Asked if he feels chemical weapons are a
sufficient deterrent, he said "yes" but added with a rare
smile, "If the U.S. were to lend us nuclear weapons with the
objective of balancing those Israel was given we shall not
decline them."
   In his one philosophical moment, the president conceded
Arabs made a mistake in 1967 by not accepting Israel's offer
of land for peace. Then, the Arabs believed they could take
back the land without granting peace. Now the Arabs offer
peace for land -- a home for Palestinians on the West Bank --
and Israel seems little interested. Asked about this irony,
he said, "The Arabs have made their mistakes."
   On other issues, President Hussein said Iraq is engaged in
a "direct dialogue" with Iran aimed at transforming the
present cease fire between the two countries into a permanent
peace. He also said he intends to hold a referendum later
this year on both a new constitution and his own leadership.
"If counting votes is the only means for you {the U.S.} to
gauge the popularity of a leader, then you will have figures
this year," he said.
   The president was also characteristically defiant about
Iraq's execution in March of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born
British journalist accused of espionage. The U.S. and Britain
"began to talk about ruthless Saddam with no heart when a spy
is executed to avoid a return to the time when foreigners ran
rampant in this country," he said. "We will not allow any
foreigner to steal intelligence."
