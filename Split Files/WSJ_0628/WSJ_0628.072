   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. picked its former
independent auditor to be chief financial officer in a
reorganization designed to tighten internal controls and
insulate the company's chairman and chief executive officer,
Fred Carr, from day-to-day contacts with regulators,
investors and the media.
   William L. Sanders, who will become chief financial
officer, treasurer and a corporate vice president on July 1,
has been Deloitte &amp; Touche's partner in charge of auditing
First Executive since 1986. Mr. Sanders, 44 years old, also
has been director of the accounting firm's financial
institutions group in Los Angeles.

   "Mr. Sanders brings a wealth of experience which will be
key in view of the rapidly evolving insurance business,"
First Executive said in a statement.
   The troubled insurance holding company has been under
pressure from regulators and investors to strengthen and
formalize its management procedures, analysts said. "There's
been a perception that Fred Carr runs things a bit by the
seat of his pants," said James Ramenda, an analyst at
Northington Partners Inc. in Avon, Conn.
   First Executive said Mr. Sanders's appointment and other
executive changes will eventually affect the reporting
relationships and jobs of a significant number of employees,
including Mr. Carr. He "has spent an awful lot of time
talking to reporters, securities analysts and investors;
hopefully we can satisfy communications needs without taking
so much of his time," said a company spokesman.
   Mr. Sanders succeeds Merle Horst, 42, who relinquishes the
duties of chief financial officer and treasurer, but retains
the title of vice president. First Executive said he will
oversee the "two newly defined functions" of institutional
markets and industry relations. He also continues as senior
vice president of Executive Life Insurance Co., the company's
main unit.
   In his new post, Mr. Horst will manage the company's
investment products and relations with investors, creditors,
security analysts, rating agencies and insurance regulators.
Although Mr. Horst will have fewer people reporting to him in
his new post, a company spokesman said that the executive
isn't taking a step down.
   "Making sure that regulators and rating agencies
understand the financial strength of our company is
absolutely one of the top priorities here," the spokesman
said. Communications with these groups had been "fragmented
and will be more effective concentrated under a single senior
executive."
   William C. Adams, 44, was named senior vice president of
Executive Life Insurance in charge of a newly formed
corporate services group. Mr. Adams has been a part-time
company consultant since February. He was formerly executive
vice president of Essex Life Insurance Co. in West Orange,
N.J.
   G. Rodney J. Letts, 40, assumes responsibility for
policyholder services for First Executive's five insurance
subsidiaries. He continues as senior vice president of
reinsurance for the largest one of them, Executive Life
Insurance.
   Under the new structure, the number of executives
reporting directly to Alan Snyder, president and chief
operating officer, will be slashed to about eight from 14,
enabling him to manage more effectively, First Executive
said. Some functions handled separately at the parent and
subsidiary level will be consolidated to eliminate
duplication.
   Analysts reactions to the changes were mixed. "Any step
that helps to give policyholders and regulators a sense of
confidence" is positive, said Tom Richter, an analyst at the
brokerage firm of Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta.
Northington Partner's Mr. Ramenda called the moves "cosmetic.
It's the same cast of characters with different names."
   Mr. Ramenda and other critics questioned First Executive's
decision to bring in Mr. Sanders as chief financial officer
in view of some regulators' criticisms of company accounting
practices. A New York state insurance department report that
surfaced in May complained of sloppy accounting systems in
the mid-1980s at the company's New York unit.
   Those problems took place before Mr. Sanders began
auditing First Executive so "it would be misleading to saddle
him with responsibility. "There haven't been any regulatory
criticisms of our accounting practices" since he took over,
the First Executive spokesman said.
   California's Department of Insurance, concerned about
First Executive's depressed junk-bond holdings and the impact
of recent policy surrenders on the company's financial
health, has been conducting a special examination at the
Executive Life Insurance unit since January. The corporate
reorganization wasn't suggested by the insurance department,
a spokeswoman said.
