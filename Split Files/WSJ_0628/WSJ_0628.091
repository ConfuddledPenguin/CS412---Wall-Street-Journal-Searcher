   WASHINGTON -- The House Telecommunications subcommittee
passed a bill to reregulate cable television rates and
encourage new competitors to challenge existing cable
companies.
   Under the measure, which passed on a voice vote, the
Federal Communications Commission would establish the maximum
fee that cable operators could charge for basic cable service
consisting of local broadcast signals and public education
and government channels. Other cable programming would be
subject to regulation as well, but on a case-by-case basis.

   The legislation would direct the FCC to develop criteria
to identify "unreasonable or abusive" rates and to establish
procedures for reducing rates that are excessive. Local or
state authorities could file complaints with the FCC alleging
that rates are unreasonable or abusive.
   The legislation also seeks to ensure that emerging
competitors to cable companies -- such as so-called wireless
cable operators and direct broadcast satellite service -- can
obtain programming. Cable programmers that are owned wholly
or in part by cable operators, for example, couldn't
unreasonably refuse to sell programming to cable competitors.
Also, cable operators couldn't require exclusive arrangements
from cable programmers as a condition for carrying their
programs.
   But the future of the House bill and of a similar Senate
measure is cloudy. Cable interests are fighting both
measures. "We intend to remain involved in the process, but
at this point, the question of whether a bill acceptable to
the industry can be enacted this year remains very much
unresolved," said the National Cable Television Association.
   Consumer groups, however, claimed a victory because the
House committee bill contains stronger consumer protections
than the cable reregulation bill that the Senate Commerce
Committee passed this month. "Consumers, satellite services,
broadcasters and others got their pound of flesh -- all out
of cable's hide," said Gene Kimmelman, legislative director
for the Consumer Federation of America.
   Meanwhile, telephone companies are trying to lift the ban
on their entry into the cable business. An amendment that
would permit cable competition from phone companies is
expected to be considered when the bill reaches the House
floor.
