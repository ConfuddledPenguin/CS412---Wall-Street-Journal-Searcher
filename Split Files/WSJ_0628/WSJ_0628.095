   WASHINGTON -- All failed savings and loans under
government control are now being investigated for ties to
former junk-bond king Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., federal regulators said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which investigates
possible fraud at all insolvent thrifts, said yesterday it's
launching a special task force to examine whether Drexel
contributed to the failures and will pursue those losses in
Drexel's bankruptcy case. The FDIC expects preliminary
findings for these 350 thrifts in about one month, the agency
said.

   "We want to make sure that as far as Drexel and Milken
relationships go, the investigators accelerate that work and
get their findings in to us," said Jack Smith, deputy general
counsel of the FDIC.
   Two things prompted the FDIC to step up its Drexel
investigation beyond several large institutions. For one,
forming the task force indirectly acknowledges that more
thrifts have ties to Drexel -- through purchases of
high-risk, high-yield "junk" bonds and loans to the firm --
than was previously thought. Also, the bankruptcy court
recently imposed a Nov. 15 deadline for creditor claims, the
agency said.
   Mr. Smith won't say how much Drexel contributed to thrift
losses, except to say, "It's in the millions of dollars."
Failed S&amp;Ls hold a total of about $4 billion to $6 billion in
junk bonds.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission says it is Drexel's
largest unsecured creditor because of the $150 million that
Drexel has pledged to it under a consent decree to compensate
civil claimants who seek recourse for losses. Yesterday, FDIC
General Counsel Alfred Byrne said in a statement: "In fact,
we believe that the FDIC and the (Resolution Trust Corp.) may
be among the largest creditors in the Drexel bankruptcies.
Through this new task force, and through other measures, we
intend to recover the maximum amount possible for our
insurance funds and ultimately, for the American taxpayer."
   The FDIC's bankruptcy probe is running a parallel course
to several other pending federal Drexel investigations by the
Justice Department and the SEC. Several large, insolvent
thrifts, including Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association of
Irvine, Calif.; CenTrust Savings of Miami, and Columbia
Savings of Beverly Hill, Calif., were big customers of
Drexel. Many of these thrifts, it is alleged, swapped the
junk bonds and booked artificial profits on the sales.
   "We will keep a sharp eye out for daisy-chain operations,"
Mr. Smith said.
   Federal investigators will also be looking at whether
CenTrust was able to raise capital through Drexel in exchange
for buying millions of dollars of Drexel-issued junk bonds.
   "There are other institutions that had relations with
Drexel," Mr. Smith of the FDIC said. "The question is whether
you find losses associated with that. That's what we are
looking into."
   Mr. Milken earlier this year pleaded guilty to six felony
counts of securities fraud, and agreed to pay $600 million in
fines and restitution. He is expected to be sentenced in
October. Mr. Milken hasn't cooperated with the investigation
so far, but is expected to do so after sentencing. One
government official said yesterday that at that point,
government investigators expect him to cooperate with the
bankruptcy investigation as well.
   The task force will include about a dozen attorneys in
Washington, and dozens more in the field, Mr. Smith said.
