   WEST BERLIN -- Allianz AG of West Germany, outflanking a
last-minute rival bid by domestic competitors, said it signed
final contracts giving it a 51% stake in East Germany's state
insurance monopoly for 270.7 million marks ($163.1 million)
in cash.
   Announcing the pact yesterday, the day after it was
signed, Allianz said the transaction "provides the conditions
for the venture to begin business operations" in East Germany
on Sunday -- the day the two Germanys are to link their
monetary and social institutions to form one German economy.

   East Berlin's public trust for East German industry, or
Treuhandanstalt, will retain a 49% interest in the new
venture, called Deutsche Versicherungs-AG. But Allianz said
its controlling interest gives it the right of first refusal
should Treuhandanstalt ever decide to sell.
   The controversial transaction gives Europe's largest
insurance group a dominating position in the East German
market. In disclosing its intention of taking even a lesser
49% stake in Deutsche Versicherungs in March, Allianz
triggered howls of protest from other West German insurance
groups, angered over the prospect of Allianz achieving a
quick monopoly in East Germany before they could build their
own East German operations.
   West German antitrust authorities said the case affected
only the East German market, and thus was outside their
jurisdiction.
   On Tuesday, the day Allianz signed contracts with the East
German government, a group of five other West German insurers
led by Colonia Versicherungs in Cologne announced a
counteroffer for the East German insurance network. Promising
to pay the same price as Allianz, the group vowed to break up
the former monopoly into regional insurance groups.
   But, said an Allianz official yesterday: "Their offer has
been overtaken by events."
   Allianz's successful sweep into East Germany leaves other
West German insurers infuriated at having to start from
scratch. Colonia spokesman Norbert Kampf said that even some
East German officials had warned the Allianz takeover gives
the Munich-based group a dominating share in a market of 16
million inhabitants.
   "Allianz's position will be reduced in time, as other
insurance companies set up their own operations. But even a
25% or 30% market share is very high in the insurance
business," Mr. Kampf contended.
   Allianz sought to defuse criticism by citing the approval
of East German authorities, who also promised to throw open
the market to other insurance companies after Germany's
economic merger on Sunday.
