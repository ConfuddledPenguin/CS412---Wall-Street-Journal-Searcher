   -- States can't require that both parents be notified
before a minor has an abortion, unless they also provide for
a court hearing for those who don't want to inform their
families. (Hodgson vs. Minnesota, 54) But states may require
that one parent be told. It is unclear, however, whether such
a law also requires a court hearing procedure. (Ohio vs.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 6-3)

to die, states may require clear evidence that a patient in a

student religious groups the same access to scheduling and
facilities that other extracurricular activities receive.
