   NEW YORK -- The dollar ended about where it started as
traders wait for next week's news.
   While market talk still centers on German monetary union
and the mark's rosy future, lower U.S. interest rates and the
dollar's slow demise, risk taking is being avoided this week
with so many market-moving events slated for next week.

   On Sunday and Monday, banks will distribute marks to East
Germans. On Monday and Tuesday, the U.S. central bank's
Federal Open Market Committee will haggle over credit policy.
   Until then, foreign exchange traders remain a downbeat
bunch. Said John Lyman, the Bank of Tokyo's senior customer
dealer in New York, "People have been burned so much trying
to make a breakout from the {current trading} ranges. Every
time they do, it comes back in their faces. Traders are
frustrated; profits are down; and people are trying anything
to make money."
   The result, said David Ogg, chief New York dealer for
Credit Suisse, is a nervous market that's producing many
erratic moves within a single range.
   An example was provided by the dollar's only mentionable
move on the day. Having slid against all major currencies
Tuesday, slipping under both 1.6700 marks and 155 yen, the
U.S. unit staged a fleeting rally against European currencies
yesterday. The dollar reached 1.6670 marks before slipping.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6645 marks, up from 1.6630 marks late Tuesday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 154.45 yen, down
from 154.67 yen in New York late Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 154.53 yen; it closed Wednesday in Tokyo at 154.35 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6635
marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.6627 marks.
   With no single theme found Wednesday among
foreign-exchange rooms, various traders attributed the day's
price blip to various factors.
   Charles Spence, a Los Angeles vice president with First
Interstate Bank of California, noted that short-term "day
traders" who had sold the dollar earlier in North American
dealings, were forced to buy it back when the U.S. currency
rallied on a positive report of May leading indicators. The
index rose 0.8% on the month, slightly better than
expectations for a 0.7% improvement.
   He said the tables were turned on the dollar when
long-term fund managers who had missed a chance to sell
dollars just below 1.6700 marks during Tuesday's rapid dollar
decline decided to take advantage of the opportunity to dump
the U.S. currency.
   Mr. Lyman of Bank of Tokyo saw other forces at work. He
said some major players went "fishing for stop-loss buying on
short-dollar positions." The speculators bought dollars
against marks and Swiss francs, Mr. Lyman said, and succeeded
in "squeezing some people" before market forces carried the
dollar back down.
   The rally almost took on a life of its own, Mr. Lyman
said. At its intraday peak of 1.6670 marks, the dollar was
near a chart point at 1.6680 marks where many traders would
have shifted their positions from long, or overbought, mark
positions to short, or oversold, postures. That could have
launched the dollar to its next stepping stone at 1.6730
marks, he said. Instead, the dollar settled back.
   The U.S. currency is being held down by its own demerits
and by the advantages of certain competitors.
   Anticipation of lower U.S. interest rates, which would
dissuade investors from buying dollar instruments, is
building again. President Bush's allowance Tuesday that "tax
revenue increases" could be part of a federal budget deficit
reduction package is expected to allow Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan a face-saving way to accede to
administration pressure for lower interest rates.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady added another strong
hint late in the trading session yesterday by questioning the
need for a tight credit policy.
   The issue had already been churned by Washington-based
syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. They
wrote that Fed governors would vote at the policy-making
meeting to ease rates at the end of July.
   As sentiment turns against the dollar, the West German
currency is gathering followers.
   Alan Leventen, managing director of financial services for
Balfour, Maclaine Futures, said the pattern of the mark's
20-pfennig rise since last November suggests the market wants
it to go higher. The mark's technical pattern, Mr. Leventen
said, is the strongest on the market.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $351.40 an ounce, up $1. Estimated volume
was a light 2.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $350.75 an
ounce.
