   Mobil Corp. formally agreed to withdraw all environmental
claims for Hefty trash bags sold in Texas under a settlement
with one of seven states that recently sued for alleged false
advertising.
   Texas and six other states sued Mobil Chemical Co., a unit
of New York-based Mobil, earlier this month for claiming that
Hefty bags are "degradable" even after burial in landfills.
The states contend the labeling is deceptive because Mobil
has admitted the bags don't degrade rapidly enough to extend
the life of municipal landfills.

   Mobil voluntarily agreed last March to withdraw all
environmental claims, but that pledge wasn't legally binding.
Now, under the settlement, Mobil agreed to make no
environmental claims for its Hefty and Kordite bag lines sold
in Texas for three years and to pay the state $15,000. After
three years, Mobil will be able to make environmental claims
only if fully substantiated.
   Texas officials have also requested the state's largest
retail chains to display a "prominent" sign in aisles where
Hefty products are sold stating: "Plastic bags do not degrade
in landfills. Plastic bags that claim to be `degradable' are
no better for the environment than any other bags." However,
Mobil is allowed to sell its remaining inventory, which could
last until the end of this year.
   Texas Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner said he
hopes the settlement could provide a model for agreements in
other states.
   Mobil Chemical spokesman Allen Gray said the company
"fully substantiated" the degradability claim and never
deceived consumers. However, the company told retailers it
agreed to settle the case to avoid further controversy that
could "add to consumers' misconceptions."
   Mr. Gray said the settlement was merely putting the
company's voluntary agreement in writing.
   Hefty bags with new labels are starting to reach shelves,
Mr. Gray said, adding: "We hope that other bag manufacturers
will voluntarily remove degradability claims until widely
recognized standards for labeling are adopted."
   He said lawsuits in the six other states will be handled
"case by case," but "we would prefer not to litigate."
Lawsuits against Mobil are pending in California, New York,
Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington.
   A task force of eight attorneys general is continuing to
investigate a variety of environmental claims by other makers
of plastic bags, disposable diapers and other products.
