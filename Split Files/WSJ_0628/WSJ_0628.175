   Just before the start of a sneak preview of Bill Cosby's
latest effort to overcome his unfortunate feature-film track
record, the babysitter of the two young boys sitting behind
me asked his charges if they knew what "Ghost Dad" was about.
"Ummmm, I saw the ad on TV," said the eight-year-old, in
between swallows of Gummi Bears. "Yeah," said the sitter.
"But what's the movie about?" Emboldened by the bears, the
boy concentrated a few seconds, then declared: "It's about
Bill Cosby]" As it turned out, this capsule review turned out
to be a perfect summary of the movie.
   "Ghost Dad" consists of Bill Cosby mugging in his Bill
Cosby way. Through his weekly television series he has become
a brand name, as recognizable as any of the numerous products
he advertises. The main difference between the movie and the
television series is the absence of the laugh track. This
should have seemed like an improvement. However, I started
yearning for those annoying programmed bleats so I'd have a
better idea of what the film makers thought was amusing.

   For those who have missed the commercials for the movie,
"Ghost Dad" is about Bill Cosby playing a widower, a father
of three children. He drowns and returns to his family as a
ghost who can be seen in the dark. This experience teaches
him his failings as a father and as a human being. Well,
okay. Some fine Hollywood pictures have evolved from
variations on this theme: "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" (1941) and
its 1978 remake, "Heaven Can Wait," immediately come to mind.
   "Ghost Dad," however, isn't a movie so much as a prolonged
situation comedy, the very thing that has made Mr. Cosby so
very successful on television. Like Mr. Cosby's weekly
series, the movie hops along from situation to situation,
carefully avoiding either emotional depths or comic highs.
When Mr. Cosby, for example, reveals to his already
motherless children that he has become a ghost (and that he
must be dead), they look slightly upset. Then they quickly
accept the situation and move on to the next thing.

   This is summer, so the next thing often is the same thing,
and so there it is: "Robocop 2." A great many people -- not I
-- adored Paul Verhoeven's original "Robocop," a bloody,
blackhearted satire of a future dominated by cynical
bureaucrats. I found the picture's sly malice overwhelmed by
the relentless barrage of brutality. Mr. Verhoeven's
box-office success was rewarded; he went on to apply his
technological bombast to "Total Recall," another gory
blockbuster. This left "Robocop 2" in the hands of Irwin
Kershner, who has dutifully tried to copy Mr. Verhoeven but
managed only to retain the crudeness and the violence.
   In the original, Peter Weller played a good cop in the
Detroit-of-the-future. He gets gunned down in the line of
duty. The wide-ranging and malevolent corporation that runs
the city transfers his few living parts -- mainly his brain
-- into a mechanism that approximates a merger of the Tin Man
and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He retains enough humanity to
resist the evil will of his creators and continues his
prerobotic impulse to preserve public order.
   He does this with ingeniously ruthless tactics that not
only incinerate his enemies but also mock the video age. The
sequel makers couldn't re-create Robocop, the thing that gave
the original its story. So they decided to make a sequel
within a sequel by constructing a second superpoliceman who
is part man, part machine. But Robocop 2 was constructed from
the remains of a very bad man, a drug dealer who has becalmed
the city with Nuke, a powerful narcotic. In their inevitable
struggle, these two metallic behemoths face off in a clunky
battle reminiscent of the Godzilla movies (and not much more
sophisticated despite the obviously extravagant expenditure
of funds on machinery).
   This plodding "Robocop 2" substitutes tastelessness for
energy and wit. Its big innovation: having small children
spew vile language to no apparent purpose.

   At another time the slight comedy called "Betsy's Wedding"
mightn't seem quite as appealing. But its affability and
simplicity come as welcome relief to the current onslaught of
noise and nonsense at the movies. Alan Alda wrote, directed
and starred in this story of an Italian contractor with a
redheaded wife (Madeline Kahn) and two redheaded daughters.
   His younger daughter, Betsy (Molly Ringwald), is the kind
of uninteresting young woman who tries to build something
into her character by wearing eccentric clothing. She is
about to get married. Connie (Ally Sheedy), the elder, is
genuinely eccentric. She is a policewoman, she explains,
because she gets a kick out of arresting people.
   As might be expected from an Alda project, this one has
its share of cutesy and self-conscious moments, mostly
involving Mr. Alda's character. He plays the contractor Eddie
Hopper (not to be confused with Elliot Hopper, the character
Mr. Cosby plays in "Ghost Dad"). The competition that arises
between him and the prospective groom's wealthy father for
control of their children's wedding bounces along breezily
enough. Most fun, however, are the ancillary stories that
have little to do with Betsy's wedding. Best is Anthony La
Paglia as Stevie Dee, the goofy yet endearing thug who falls
in love with Connie the cop. Stevie's taste in clothes and
everything else is strictly from Vegas, but his puppyish
pursuit of Connie has a charm all its own.

   VIDEO TIP: Spencer Tracy did the nervous dad routine with
his usual grace in "Father of the Bride." Elizabeth Taylor,
the bride, was simply gorgeous. Of course, the best wedding
moment in a movie occurs at the end of "The Graduate," and
the best moment in "Heartburn," also directed by Mike
Nichols, was the wedding.
