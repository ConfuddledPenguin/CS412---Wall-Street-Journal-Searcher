   DALLAS -- Metro Airlines Inc. will post a fourth-quarter
loss of $4 million to $4.5 million, or 70 cents a share, but
is projecting a profitable first and second quarters of the
current fiscal year, J.L. Seaborn, president and chief
operating officer, said.
   The loss in the three months ended April 30 was less than
half Metro's year-earlier fourth-quarter deficit of $9.2
million, or $1.54 a share, which was caused primarily by a
strike and bankruptcy filing at Eastern Airlines. Metro
operates feeder carriers affiliated with several airlines,
including Eastern in Atlanta.

   Metro expects to report fourth-quarter revenue of about
$55 million, up from $34.4 million a year earlier, Mr.
Seaborn said in an interview.
   For the full fiscal year, revenue was about $195 million,
up from $147.5 million. Full-year net losses were about $19
million, or $3.20 a share, he said, compared with a
year-earlier loss of $10.7 million, or $1.83 a share, before
an accounting change.
   In the current quarter, operations are showing sharp
improvement, Mr. Seaborn said. "Revenues are at an all-time
high," he said, reflecting a turnaround in Atlanta and an
improvement in Metro's Northeast operations. He didn't offer
specific projections for revenue or net income for this
quarter or next.
   Mr. Seaborn said Metro showed a profit for May and June,
the first two months of its current fiscal year, now that
Eastern is operating 288 flights a day in the Atlanta market.
This month, he said, Metro will carry about 80,000 passengers
in and out of Atlanta, topping its previous one-month high
there of 66,000 passengers, when Eastern was at full
strength.
   Although Atlanta operations represent only a quarter of
Metro's flights, about 80% of those connect with Eastern. Mr.
Seaborn said Eastern's troubles were a primary cause of
Metro's heavy losses over the last fiscal year.
   Traffic also began to pick up in the fourth quarter on
Metro Air Northeast, and the division posted a profit in May,
said Brian Miller, Metro's chief financial officer.
   Metro Northeast feeds passengers into the Trans World
Airlines Inc. network. The division, formerly Brockway Air
Inc., was purchased by Metro in 1989. Last July, Metro
changed the unit's name and switched its affiliation to TWA
from Piedmont Airlines. The changes caused traffic to drop
temporarily and contributed to Metro's losses during the
just-concluded year.
   In addition to its operations with Eastern in Atlanta,
Metro operates as a feeder carrier for American Airlines in
Dallas/ Fort Worth. Mr. Seaborn said Metro's there have been
stable and profitable.
