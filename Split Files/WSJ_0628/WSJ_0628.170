   WASHINGTON -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced
guidelines that will increase the amount of mildly
radioactive waste and other material that is exempt from NRC
regulation.
   This "below regulatory concern" approach is designed to
give the commissioners a uniform framework for granting
blanket exemptions covering such activities as the
decontamination of nuclear power plants, and such materials
as consumer products and low-level radioactive waste.

   In the past, the commission has granted exemptions on a
case-by-case basis to a few products. The NRC contends that
allowing for blanket exemptions will enable it to focus its
resources on more-serious risks.
   Consumer and environmental groups attacked the change,
saying it will result in excessive radiation exposure to
individuals and increase cancer deaths.
   Under the new policy, a material or practice can be
considered for exemption if it will result in an average
radiation dose to an individual of less than 10 millirems a
year. By comparison, a single round-trip cross-country
airline trip exposes an individual to about five millirems of
radiation, the NRC said.
   For consumer products or recycled materials, the dose
couldn't be above one millirem a year.
