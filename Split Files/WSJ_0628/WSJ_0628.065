   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Labor Committee approved a bill
that would impose stiffer sentences for criminal safety and
health violations by employers.
   The committee voted 11-5 for the bill, sponsored by Sens.
Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) and James Jeffords (R., Vt.).
All the Democratic committee members and two Republicans --
Mr. Jeffords and Sen. David Durenberger of Minnesota -- voted
for the measure.

   Separately, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole is expected
today to urge that the maximum civil penalty for a violation
of provisions of child-labor law be boosted to $10,000 from
$1,000. In testimony prepared for delivery to the House Labor
Standards subcommittee, Mrs. Dole will note that the
department's Employment Standards Administration already has
boosted penalties as much as fourfold by considering
different violations involving one child separately, rather
than as a single violation.
   Two recent sweeps by the agency uncovered more than 2,800
child-labor violations, and more than $6 million in penalty
assessments are expected, according to her testimony.
   Under the bill approved by the Senate panel, employer
violations of the occupational safety and health law that
result in worker deaths would become felonies, rather than
misdemeanors. The legislation also would boost the maximum
jail sentence to 10 years from six months and the maximum
fine for such criminal violations under the worker safety and
health law to $250,000 from $10,000 for each violation. The
Justice Department says maximum fines of $250,000 a violation
for individuals and $500,000 for companies already can be
imposed under general criminal code.
   Under the Senate bill, willful violations that result in
serious bodily injury would become a criminal offense subject
to a jail sentence of as much as five years. And any federal
preemption of often-tougher state prosecutions of such
violations on murder or other charges wouldn't be allowed.
   The Bush administration supports the increasing criminal
penalties for employer violations that result in death and
the bar on federal pre-emption. But it opposes making
responsibility for serious bodily injury a criminal offense;
the Labor Department has said it is impossible to define with
any clarity what constitutes such an injury.
