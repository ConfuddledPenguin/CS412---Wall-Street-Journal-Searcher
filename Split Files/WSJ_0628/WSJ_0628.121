   Air travelers have saved millions of dollars as a result
of airline deregulation. But there is mounting concern that
airlines are resorting to sophisticated and illegal tactics
to subvert the fare competition that deregulation had
encouraged.
   The Justice Department has begun four separate
investigations of possible antitrust violations in the
industry. The investigations focus on suspected collusion,
predatory pricing and efforts by airlines to block
competition in certain markets. The industry has denied any
wrongdoing.

   In the newest development, the government has sent
airlines formal requests for information on their
relationship with Airline Tariff Publishing Co., the industry
clearinghouse for fares. It has been learned that major
carriers have begun receiving what are known as civil
investigative demands from the department. The 18-page
request states that the government is investigating possible
price-fixing.
   Trust-busters appear most concerned with industry
concentration at airports dominated by only one or two
airlines. In cities such as St. Louis, Minneapolis and
Pittsburgh, a single carrier now boards more than 70% of
passengers. Studies have shown such dominance results in
higher fares.
   Many of the near-monopolies were created by airline
mergers in the 1980s. But airlines also have developed novel
and complex tactics for defending their turf -- some of which
the government may decide to challenge. Investigators are
examining, among other things, the control of airport gates
and takeoff and landing slots. In Pittsburgh, the Justice
Department is looking at whether an agreement to build a new
airport terminal effectively locks in USAir's 80%-plus share
of that market. USAir denies any wrongdoing, but its
agreement has drawn fire because it prevents other carriers
from moving into the old terminal it will vacate.
   The most controversial practices, however, have to do with
the way carriers publish prices through a commonly owned
computer network. Operated by Airline Tariff Publishing,
based in Washington, D.C., the system was designed to provide
instantaneous transmission of more than 100,000 domestic fare
changes that take place each day in the industry.
Centralizing this information makes it easier for airlines to
enter the data in their computer reservations systems for
travel agents.
   But critics in and out of government believe it also
provides a behind-the-scenes system that enables airlines to
communicate pricing intentions to one another. According to
former and current airline pricing officials, fare changes
and computer coding sometimes contain signals to other
carriers.
   The Wall Street Journal has found evidence of such
"conversations" by arranging to tap directly into ATP's
electronic database. The crucial signals between carriers,
people in the industry say, translate as follows: "Let me
determine the prices at my hub airport and I'll let you do
the same at yours."
   Says Donald Garvett, a former vice president of revenue
management at Pan American World Airways: "It's almost like
electronic negotiation." But, he says, "I wouldn't like to
suggest that anyone is doing anything illegal. It's normal
procedure to defend your turf."
   All of the major carriers except Eastern Airlines refused
requests for interviews on the subject. Several said it was
too sensitive in light of the Justice Department's
investigations.
   David Kunstler, vice president of planning at Eastern, a
subsidiary of Continental Airlines Holding Inc., said in an
interview that he has "no knowledge" that carriers signal
each other through ATP.
   "The word signalling implies an element of collusion, and
we set prices independent of any other airline," he said. "If
anybody at Eastern Airlines were engaging in that kind of
activity, I would absolutely tell them to cease and desist."
   Others, however, say signalling does take place, and it
amounts to a subtle version of the type of price-fixing that
once took place in smoke-filled rooms. "It's a serious
problem," says Ian Ayers, a specialist on antitrust issues at
Northwestern University's law school. The use of the computer
network "is a way of facilitating collusion," he says. "It's
easier to reach agreements. It's easier to detect breaches of
an agreement."
   Before Braniff went into bankruptcy proceedings last year,
pricing officials at the carrier became so concerned about
the communications they were seeing on computer terminals
that they began keeping a log of suspected antitrust
violations. The log has since vanished, former Braniff
employees say.
   The most common -- and perhaps most questionable --
"discussion" between airlines is played out like this:
Carrier A -- often a smaller operator such as Midway Airlines
or America West -- attempts to boost its business by lowering
ticket prices. It enters lower fares in the industry's
computer system. In response, Carrier B -- the dominant
carrier at the affected airport -- not only matches the new
fares, but lowers them in other markets that are served by
Carrier A.
   Carrier B may also attach special codes to its new fares
to get its message across. Pricing executives say some
carriers have been known to prefix new fares with the letters
"FU" to indicate an indelicate imperative. The end result is
that Carrier A often cancels its reduction, depriving
consumers of a lower fare.
   This pattern has occurred many times.
   Last summer, for instance, America West Airlines tried to
attract more business in several markets, including
Minneapolis, with lower fares payable 21 days in advance.
Bargain-hunting vacationers typically respond to such deals.
   America West's reductions might have pressured Northwest
Airlines to cut fares on its busy Minneapolis-Los Angeles
route to $258 a round trip from $308 to match the America
West fare. Instead, Northwest set a new fare that struck
directly at America West's hub in Phoenix. Northwest lowered
its cheapest fare between Phoenix and New York to $168 a
round trip from $208 -- but initially made the low fare
available for only two days.
   That, people in the industry say, was sufficient to
deliver to America West a signal. Five days after instituting
its bargain fares, America West abandoned them. Northwest
says it makes about 20,000 fare changes a day and cannot
reconstruct them a year later, but it says "competitive
initiatives and responses" are a constant part of its
pricing.
   Such exchanges take place in the context of a broad,
continuing dialogue within the computer system -- where
carriers have developed a language for talking to each other.
Former and current airline pricing officials say that when a
carrier wants to communicate its displeasure with a
neighbor's fare cut, it sometimes matches the new fare for a
shorter lifespan. That, they say, is a warning to remove the
new fare from the system.
   Last summer, both Northwest Airlines and Midway Airlines
were offering bargain fares on the Chicago-Grand Rapids,
Mich., route, effective until July 31. Continental and
American had matched the fares, but set their expiration
dates earlier, for July 17. People in the business
interpreted this as a warning to Northwest and Midway to end
their bargain fares earlier, too. Northwest moved up its
expiration date to July 21, and Midway to July 18.
   Another tactic is more subtle. When any fare is changed
even slightly, the electronic tariff program highlights it in
the computer system. Sometimes a carrier will make a weird or
nonsensical change in a fare just so that analysts at another
airline will see the fare highlighted. The message: "Get rid
of this fare."
   Antitrust law makes it illegal for companies to conspire
to fix prices or even attempt to do so. Proving that this has
happened is easier when prosecutors can show evidence of a
face-to-face meeting or telephone call.
   The law is less clear when indirect signaling could be
involved. One test is whether a company's actions appear
economically sound. In 1974, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York ruled that it was important to determine
whether "a seller's conduct . . . is contrary to its
independent self-interest" in a price-fixing case. Cutting
fares more deeply than necessary to undercut the competition,
for example, would seem intended as a warning to the
competition rather than a genuinely competitive and economic
reduction, especially if fares quickly return to a higher
level.
   Many of the back-and-forth fare tactics in the airline
industry appear to have little economic relevance to the
market involved. To critics, this supports the notion that
airlines are often signalling each other rather than
permitting supply and demand alone to dictate fares.
   Last year, according to a person close to the situation,
United Airlines pricing officials were miffed when Braniff
cut fares on flights between Chicago and Los Angeles, a
lucrative route for United. In response, according to this
person, United introduced a $99 one-way fare between Los
Angeles and Kansas City, which was then Braniff's hub. The
United price cut, from a starting fare of $149, seemed
extreme; United was charging almost three times as much to
fly from Kansas City to Denver. But Braniff, desperate to
stay in business, failed to back down, even after United
again reduced the Los Angeles-Kansas City fare to $94.
"United Airlines declines to comment other than to state its
pricing decisions are based on the competitive marketplace,"
the UAL unit said in a statement yesterday.
   Fares in and out of Kansas City have risen considerably
since the Braniff bankruptcy. Last year, travelers could fly
between Kansas City and St. Louis for $78 round trip.
Yesterday, the lowest fare was $135.
   In coding its new Los Angeles-Kansas City fare on the
computer system last year United inserted as part of the code
the letters "FLYUA." Critics suspect that this and similar
coding shows that carriers sometimes are only interested in
sending each other a message. Last November, Continental
Airlines used the letters "HP" in the combination of letters
and numbers used to code new, lower fares on flights between
Phoenix and Omaha, Wichita, Baltimore and New York City; the
lowest round-trip fare between Phoenix and New York was
reduced to $218 from $228. "HP" is normally the industry code
for America West, which a few days before had invaded
Continental's turf in Houston with new service and low fares.
   After America West withdrew its low introductory fares,
Continental withdrew its "HP" fares. A Continental spokesman
says, "Continental does not engage in or endorse any type of
signaling concerning air fares."
   The Justice Department request that was sent to carriers
recently asks for detailed information on how airlines use
the computer system to "implement fare changes, monitor
fares, {and} make decisions on fares," and on how they might
operate without access to the system.
   It also requests all information about the carrier's
relationship with the ATP system dating back to Jan. 1, 1988.
The government is seeking all documents, training manuals and
newsletters related to ATP, as well as the name and position
of all employees who handle pricing decisions. The Justice
Department is also requesting documents dating back to Jan.
1, 1986, on ATP's role in how carriers monitor, influence and
react to fare changes.
   In an incident last September, it took the nation's
airlines only nine days to match an American Airlines
proposal to raise many fares. That incident, too, is being
investigated by the Justice Department.
   It involved the controversial practice of announcing fare
increases through the computer system in advance, or
"pre-announcing." While this gives consumers advance notice
of fare increases, it may also insure that no carrier stands
alone with higher fares. "It's an abuse of the system," says
John Timmons, minority counsel on the U.S. Senate aviation
subcommittee. "The information age has redefined antitrust.
We don't need Mr. Smith to call Mr. Jones."
   American denies any wrongdoing. "We have followed the
spirit and the letter of the law," a spokeswoman says.
   Last August, United proposed increasing fares by $20 on
many flights in and out of Chicago. The increases were to
take effect in September. American, United's biggest
competitor in Chicago, matched the proposed increases, which
became effective in September.
   Some of the airlines' computer exchanges raise questions
as to whether they are using their fares to discipline
competitors who are out of step. When Northwest slashed fares
out of Chicago last August, a pricing executive at a rival
carrier privately threatened to "trash" Northwest's
Minneapolis hub if Northwest didn't retreat. When Delta
wouldn't go along with a fare increase in January 1989, a
pricing executive at a competing airline privately spoke of
"bombing" Delta's Atlanta hub of operations. A spokesman for
Delta says, "They can do what they want. We don't have any
control over what another carrier does or says."
   By trashing and bombing, airlines executives mean punitive
fare-cutting with "torture" fares. Midway Airlines, people in
the industry say, has been repeatedly "disciplined" by other
carriers for trying to go its own way on fares. Midway, a
post-deregulation startup, is one of the last surviving
low-fare airlines. Pricing, says Sen. John Danforth of
Missouri, "cries out for scrutiny."
