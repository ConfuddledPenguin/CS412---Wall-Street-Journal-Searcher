   Reading the first story in Christopher Tilghman's first
collection of stories, "In a Father's Place" (Farrar, Straus
&amp; Giroux, 214 pages, $18.95), I thought (with dismay) that I
recognized the too-familiar terrain. "On the Rivershore"
introduces Cecil Mayberry, a typical American boy (who will
doubtless grow up to be a writer) undergoing an initiation
rite -- or in more casual parlance, a growth experience.
Cecil witnesses the murder of a local Chesapeake Bay
waterman. Heading for the Big House, Cecil conveys the news
to Mr. McHugh, the local authority figure, who knows just how
these things should be handled -- i.e., covered up. One
suspects this was chosen as the opening story on account of
its supposed shock effect, but there is remarkably little to
shock -- or even hold the attention of -- the reader in this
overly understated reworking of a theme that has long since
passed into the realm of cliches.
   The remaining six stories, however, are a pleasant
surprise. They, too, are rural in setting, understated in
style, and deal with venerable themes such as fathers and
sons, husbands and wives, values and a sense of place. But
each contains something fresh and unexpected, something that
shows that Mr. Tilghman is a realist who has observed reality
carefully enough to have noticed things other realist writers
have overlooked.

   The title story portrays an uncomfortable encounter
between a middle-aged widower and his high-strung son's
girlfriend, an alarmingly tough, humorless graduate student
busily calculating the resale value of her fiance's family
heirlooms. "Norfolk, 1969" takes us into the mind and heart
of a young naval officer opposed to the Vietnam War, but
exhilarated by his shipboard experience; unable to consider
himself one of the career officers, but alienated by his
wife's conversion to the fringes of the antiwar movement. Mr.
Tilghman deftly picks out the tiny pressure points that lead
to an inevitable parting of the ways.
   "Loose Reins" follows a grown-up son revisiting his
widowed mother in Montana and trying to come to terms with
her marriage to a former ranch hand. The last story, "Mary in
the Mountains," explores the mental landscape of a quietly
unusual woman as she ruminates -- without blame or bitterness
-- on her fate as an abandoned wife. These stories prove that
there's still life in the agrarian literary tradition,
particularly when a writer knows where to look for it.
   Steven Millhauser's new collection, "The Barnum Museum"
(Poseidon, 208 pages, $18.95), sets out to be a colorful,
wildly inventive melange of meta-fictional fictions, rife
with literary allusions and the kind of playful artifice
popularized by Donald Barthelme. But like a deck of playing
cards, this set of 10 stories turns out to be less colorful,
more predetermined, than promised. Typical is "A Game of
Clue," a rather strained confection that juxtaposes the
relations among some real people playing that board game with
the imaginary affairs of the characters depicted in the game:
Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard et al. Neither group is
particularly engaging. In "Behind the Blue Curtain," a boy
manages to penetrate the mysterious world beyond the
movie-theater screen. Again, it's less intriguing than it
should be. "Klassic Komix 1" is, despite its early number, a
rather tired literary joke: cutely described frames from a
comic book illustrating "The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock."
   Other stories are more successful, taken on their own
terms, as bravura feats of the author's visual imagination.
The title story tours a museum of artifice, fantasy, a pure
fakery described in splendid detail. "The Invention of Robert
Herendeen" concerns a young man blessed or cursed with such
superfluity of imagination that he invents a fantasy woman,
conceived in such vivid detail as to seem more real than any
reality.
   The Canadian writer Carol Shields, author of story
collections, plays and novels, also is preoccupied with the
shifting balance between imagination and reality. But she
handles her themes with the kind of grace and controlled
lightness that suggest power held wisely in reserve. The 12
stories in "The Orange Fish" (Viking, 199 pages, $17.95)
cover a considerable range of subject matter, from the upbeat
story of "Hazel," a middle-aged widow who astounds her
children and her friends by taking a job demonstrating
kitchen appliances, to the sorrows of Miss Georgia Willow, a
"stern peremptory social arbiter" whose lifelong dedication
to "Good Manners" has involved her in a private life of
hapless sexual compliance.
   Ms. Shields has a gift for describing the odd little
things and experiences that can provoke intense feelings of
joy or happiness but that remain nameless, hard to
categorize, hence, unnoticed in the usual "curriculum vitae".
"Chemistry" is a recollection, some 18 years later, of the
special feeling that once blossomed among the students and
teacher of an adult-education class. "Collision" records a
chance encounter in an East European country between a man
and woman who do no more than share an umbrella in the rain.
In the title story, a depressed couple "deep in their
thirties" purchase a handsome lithograph of an orange fish
that subtly improves their lives. What happens when this
life-enhancing work of art becomes a commercialized,
mass-market product? Ms. Shields is the kind of writer who
can answer such a question, wittily, poignantly and ruefully.
