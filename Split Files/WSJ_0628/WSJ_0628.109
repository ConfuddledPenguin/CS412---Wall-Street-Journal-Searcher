   DETROIT -- The manufacturing joint venture between General
Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. signed a four-year contract
to supply Rover Group PLC of Britain with transmissions.
   Officials of New Venture Gear, the joint venture that
builds transmissions and parts, said the contract represents
the first work the venture received from outside the two auto
makers. The companies announced their intention to form a
venture last October.

   New Venture Gear officials declined to specify the amount
of transmissions or the value of the contract.
   The contract calls for New Venture Gear to supply
five-speed, front-wheel drive transmissions for use on the
Rover 825 Turbo Diesel vehicles being introduced next month
in Europe. The transmission is being manufactured at New
Venture Gear's facility in East Syracuse, N.Y.
