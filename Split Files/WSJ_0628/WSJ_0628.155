   Indian Tribes Shouldn't Bet Their Future on Casinos

   The news from Iowa:
   The flood waters are receding, but the rains took a lot of
topsoil off our farms. The primary election is over, and
abortion was an issue given far more weight than its
importance. The economy seems pretty good, though most Iowans
don't want to come right out and say that.

   So now we can get serious about the most intriguing issue
to face the state in some years: Should the Santee Sioux
Indians build a high-stakes casino in Council Bluffs? Should
the Mesquakies buy the money-losing Prairie Meadows race
track in Des Moines?
   Those are real issues with no easy answers.
   Iowa, believe it or not, allows more forms of legal
gambling than any other state, according to I. Nelson Rose, a
California law professor who studies such things. Iowa has a
lottery, and legal betting on horses and dogs, and casinos on
riverboats, and bingo, and there's even talk of allowing some
legal betting on sports.
   So talk of big-time gambling run by Indian tribes -- an
idea that seems to be somewhere between dangerous and dumb --
is not to be taken lightly.
   Indians have a special status under the gambling laws of
this country. They can set up their own rules for any kind of
gambling as long as that type of gambling is not prohibited
within the state. In other words, if a state allows bingo but
has a $5 limit, Indians can set up bingo parlors with no
limit. If a state allows blackjack but caps bets at $2,
Indians can set up blackjack games where you could win -- or
lose -- tens of thousands. The Indian games simply have to be
on Indian-owned lands. What's more, Indians can advertise
their games; others, for the most part, are barred from
advertising gambling.
   "A principal goal of federal Indian policy is to promote
tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and
strong tribal government," a 1988 law states, and then it
goes on to reaffirm to the Indians their gambling franchise
as part of that policy.
   And Indians have taken advantage of this. By one count,
more than 100 of the nation's 170 or so Indian reservations
run legal gambling operations catering to non-Indians. Last
year, some $400 million was wagered on these lands, up 15%
from a year before, according to Gaming &amp; Wagering Business
magazine.
   "The new federal statute has created unbelievable
opportunities for Indian tribes. . . . I find there is more
interest in Indian gambling than in any other possible game,"
Mr. Rose, the California professor, says.
   States have long wanted to control the operations, but
they've generally been stopped by the courts. Indian tribes
can even buy land off their reservations to set up gambling
operations, but that requires the approval of some community,
state and federal officials.
   That's why the plans of the tribes in Iowa have become an
issue.
   The Santee Sioux tribe wants to join forces with a Nevada
casino company and build a $67 million casino and hotel in
Council Bluffs, which until now has been famous mostly as the
town where Abraham Lincoln once visited and sort of decided
to run for president, and as the burial place of Amelia Jenks
Bloomer, the 19th-century suffragette who lent her name to a
kind of women's underwear.
   Council Bluffs is just across the Missouri River from
Omaha, and Des Moines and Kansas City are just a couple
hours' drive, so the casino, which would be the biggest
gambling house between Atlantic City and Las Vegas, might do
a pretty brisk business. It clearly would change the nature
of the area and probably of the state. And it clearly would
make money for the tribe.
   "I don't see Ford Motor Co. coming out here to build a
plant," Donald LaPointe, the tribal chairman, told the Des
Moines Register the other day. "What . . . are we supposed to
do" to find prosperity? The tribe's reservation is in an
isolated area of northeastern Nebraska, 150 miles from
Council Bluffs, and most of the 500 or so Indians still on
the land live in poverty.
   But that doesn't sway Terry Branstad, Iowa's Republican
governor, who is running for re-election this year. He thinks
the Council Bluffs plan is bad, and so, too, he thought, was
the Mesquakie tribe's plan, since abandoned, to buy the
beleaguered Des Moines race track -- whose publicly backed
financing, arranged through a backdoor of politics, cost
three local Democrats their jobs in the primary election this
month. Under the law, he apparently can block either project,
since neither is on land currently owned by tribes.
   "I've been very clear, very emphatic about my opposition
to expanding gambling in Iowa beyond what has already been
authorized by law," the governor told reporters a couple
weeks ago. "I'm committed to seeing that we adequately
safeguard, protect and control the integrity of this state
and not go any further into gambling."
   That's noble, and probably right. But it would be more
noble if Mr. Branstad weren't the same man who has ruled the
state as it has embraced virtually every type of gambling
there is. It would be more right if Iowans -- indeed, if all
Americans -- really cared about the Indian population, really
worked to ensure prosperity for the tribes, and were as
imaginative in seeking economic gain for the Indians as in
seeking revenue from gamblers.
   For the Indians shouldn't be building casinos and buying
race tracks that can live outside the rules governing others
in the gambling business. Indians should be encouraged in
their entrepreneurship, but advantages given them shouldn't
be the advantage of spreading vice and changing the character
of a state or community.
   It's hard to find a group of people who have been cheated
more in America than have been the American Indians. But
having them build a casino in Council Bluffs doesn't seem
like a very smart way to start righting the wrongs of the
past.
   It's almost as dumb as putting floating casinos on the
Mississippi River. But nobody in Iowa would want to do
anything like that.
   Or almost nobody.
