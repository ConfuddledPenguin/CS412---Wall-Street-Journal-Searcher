   Here's one pair of lips that never leave too many people
confused: Maggie Thatcher's. Mrs. Thatcher is now pressing
her advantage on the infamous poll-tax issue. That's right,
her advantage. Her political antennae tell her that Britons
are criticizing the government not for the poll tax itself,
but for letting Labor councils get away with high spending.
The people, she says, want tougher restrictions on profligate
councils. Sounds a lot to us like the terms of the debate
over Congress's spending.
   Back in the panic-stricken days of poll-tax riots, cooler
heads were predicting that over time, public attention would
shift from anger over the new tax to dismay over local
council profligacy. That has happened. Spending is now the
focus of attention.

   The Labor Party is screaming that new government caps on
local-council spending (locals may vote to approve or reject
the cap's new spending level) are a politically motivated
measure directed at the councils it controls. But by making
that charge, the Laborites merely emphasize that they are the
party of high spending. In the method recently legitimized by
a court decision, the government only capped those councils
whose outlays were far beyond the norm.
   The government's handling of this issue obviously has been
far from perfect. But in general, Mrs. Thatcher has
understood the ebb and flow of the controversy better than
anyone else. She strapped herself to the mast, and having
laid the groundwork for local accountability, refused to
budge. A short while ago, pundits everywhere were penning
Thatcher political obituaries. Today, her prospects for
re-election look far from hopeless.
   If she goes on the offensive on the poll-tax issue, she
takes a step toward clarifying the differences between her
party and the Labor Party. Labor has spent the last several
years trying to muddy those differences, stressing its
new-found "realism" and fiscal responsibility.
   Mrs. Thatcher would do her nation a service by making the
next election a referendum on public spending. The
scaled-down Labor Party platform still contains dozens and
dozens of uncosted spending commitments. Neil Kinnock claims
that such expenditures will not require new taxes.
   Recent polls suggest that people in Britain are willing to
pay higher taxes if they can be assured of better health and
education services. But we suspect any poll asking the
British people if they would like to have their public
services delivered more efficiently and at the lowest
possible tax cost would get a resounding yes. Mrs. Thatcher
has taken up arms against those local councils who have not
met that requirement.
   As an issue for the 1990s, it is hard to imagine how she
could have made a better choice, either from a political
point of view or in the interest of improved public policy.
