   Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., Anaheim, Calif., said Frank
J. Karcher bought the franchise rights for the company's
fast-food restaurants in Tucson, Ariz., as the last step in
the company's effort to franchise or dispose of its Arizona
operations. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The agreement calls for Frank Karcher, brother of the
company founder Carl Karcher, to own 12 Carl's Jr.
restaurants in Tucson, as well as rights to develop the chain
in the area. Until recently, Frank Karcher was vice
president, franchise operations, at Carl Karcher Enterprises.
A permanent successor hasn't been named.
