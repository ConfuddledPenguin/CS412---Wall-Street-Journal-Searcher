   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Buddy is running again.
   In the middle of his popular afternoon radio talk show,
former mayor Vincent A. (Buddy) Cianci Jr. announced that he
will run for mayor as an independent.

   Mr. Cianci was the subject of a front-page article in The
Wall Street Journal last week. He served three terms as mayor
of Providence (two as a Republican and one as an independent)
from 1975 to 1984 before being forced to resign after
pleading no contest to two assault charges for beating up the
lover of his estranged wife.
   Mr. Cianci, in an emotional speech on his show, told
listeners, "Experience is a great teacher, but often a
painful one."
   Because of his candidacy, Mr. Cianci is leaving his jobs
as a radio talk-show host and a TV political commentator.
Indeed, he went off the air yesterday after making his
announcement about 4 p.m., two hours before the radio program
was scheduled to end.
   He decided to run even though one poll conducted recently
showed that 44% of the city's voters would be embarrassed by
his election. Mr. Cianci is still believed to be a strong
candidate, however, because he has a core of staunch
supporters and the incumbent isn't running for re-election.
