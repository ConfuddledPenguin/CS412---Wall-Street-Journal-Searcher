   Menard Enterprises Inc., Rhode Island's second-largest
auto dealership has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code, underscoring the tough times for
new car dealers caught in a sales slump.
   In reaction to the slump, some auto makers, concerned
about the potential loss of sales outlets, are stepping up
efforts to keep struggling dealers in business.

   Menard, which has dealerships in three Rhode Island
cities, is the latest in a string of big car dealer chains to
petition a federal bankruptcy court for protection from
creditors and for time to develop a debt-repayment plan.
Menard's seven auto franchises listed an unspecified amount
of assets and liabilities.
   "It's a tough business right now," said Aldo Sammartino,
president of a Rhode Island dealer group. Last year, about
25% of new car dealers lost money and about 300 of the 24,900
dealers in the U.S. went out of business, he said. The
National Automobile Dealers Association expects just as many
failures this year.
   General Motors Corp., meanwhile, says 35%-40% of its
dealers currently aren't profitable. Normally, only about
15%-20% of GM dealers are unprofitable at this time of year.
   In an effort to shore up its dealer network, GM says it's
recently increased the assistance it gives to dealers to
finance the vehicles they stock. GM also announced it will
offer to repurchase the vehicles it sells to car-rental
companies, a move that will keep its dealers from having to
compete with cheaper used cars. Ford Motor Co. has followed
with a similar promise to its dealers.
   Dealerships like Menard, which sell many inexpensive
models, are among the hardest hit, experts say. These
economy-car dealers are pinched by the twin problems of
finding customers qualified for loans, and reaping thinner
profits on the vehicles they sell.
