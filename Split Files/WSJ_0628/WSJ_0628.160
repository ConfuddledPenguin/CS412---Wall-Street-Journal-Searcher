   LOS ANGELES -- The state of California sued Charles H.
Keating Jr., several officers and directors of American
Continental Corp. and the company's former accountant for
alleged fraud in the sale of $250 million in now-worthless
bonds.
   The complaint, filed in Orange County Superior Court,
seeks restitution for bondholders and civil penalties that
could range from $50 million to $100 million. The suit is the
latest in a barrage of litigation seeking "deep pockets" to
repay investors and others in the collapse of Lincoln Savings
&amp; Loan Association, a subsidiary of American Continental.

   The defendants include Jack Atchison, a partner in the
accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co. who later went on to
work for American Continental. Arthur Young, which now does
business as Ernst &amp; Young, also is named in the complaint. An
Ernst &amp; Young spokesman said the company hadn't seen the suit
and couldn't comment.
   The subordinated debentures were sold through Lincoln's
branches, and the suit alleges that the company specifically
targeted elderly investors for the bond sales. The government
alleges that the thrift's collapse may cost taxpayers more
than $2 billion.
   James Feder, an American Continental lawyer, called the
suit "a waste of time and money" and said the allegations of
a policy to sell the bonds to the elderly were not true.
Lawyers for Mr. Atchison weren't immediately available to
comment.
