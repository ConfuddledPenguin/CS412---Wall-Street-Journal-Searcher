   BONN -- West German electronics giant Siemens AG plans to
pour more than one billion German marks ($602 million) into
East Germany over the next several years as part of a bid to
become a market leader on the other side of the
fast-vanishing German border.
   In an announcement designed to highlight the scope of its
efforts, the company said it will employ between 25,000 and
30,000 workers in these new projects and expects the business
volume associated with the ventures to reach five billion
marks a year. The announcement comes just days before East
Germany adopts the West German mark as its currency and
illustrates the scramble by West German companies eager to
snare a piece of the East German market.

   "We see {East Germany} as a future part of our home
market, so we want to start treating it that way now," said
Eberhard Posner, a Siemens spokesman. He added, however, that
East Germany "will never be a substitute for investments in
other parts of the world."
   The company's rush into East Germany is matched by
smaller-scale moves into other Eastern European markets.
Today, Siemens is expected to sign a joint venture with
Polish telecommunications company Zwut, which aims to install
one million telephone lines a year by 1995. And last week,
the Munich-based company signed a joint venture accord with
the Soviet company Korolov to produce digital public
telecommunications systems in Kiev.
   The company's East German program -- covering everything
from telecommunications and factory automation to medical
technology and environmental equipment -- represents by far
the largest effort in East Germany by any Western electronics
concern.
   Siemens is working on at least 30 separate projects in
East Germany, including a venture to modernize the telephone
systems in six cities. Yesterday's announcement, while
unveiling no new ventures, was the company's first public
effort at "summing up" the full value of its plans. The
announcement also comes just weeks after the relaxing by
Western nations of high-technology export controls.
   Siemens move has some political overtones. East Germany is
bracing for a cold plunge into capitalism, with some experts
predicting mass unemployment as the nation's creaking
factories get battered by free-market forces. Bonn
politicians have grown scornful of private industry's
high-profile announcements but slow-footed moves to actually
start pouring money into the East to create jobs. West
Germany is counting on private investments to dull the pain
of economic unification.
   Siemens officials said they've had to wait for the
clarification of key legal issues before they could start
pouring money into East Germany.
   Meanwhile, the company has begun to build up a sales and
service network. For example, Siemens has opened one of 12
new sales and service centers for construction-related
electrical equipment and expects the others to open in coming
months. The company expects booming business in this area, as
East Germans rush to renovate old houses and factories. "All
of their houses need to be modernized," said Mr. Posner, "and
we want to be a major player in that area." He admitted,
however, that this is only a small slice of the new market.
   Over the longer term, Siemens plans to concentrate on
developing the same core businesses that increasingly
dominate its activities in other major markets --
telecommunications, energy generation, computer technology
and factory automation. "Siemens is a long-term oriented
company, and these are the areas where Siemens sees its
future -- whether we're talking about East Germany or any
other new market," said George Verghese, an electronics
analyst at the securities research unit of Deutsche Bank AG
in London.
   Mr. Verghese said he expects Siemens to quickly move from
simply shipping products to East Germany to using it as a
base for assembly, and eventually for production.
   Siemens officials emphasized that most of the 25,000 to
30,000 new employees will be East Germans. Up until now, West
Germans have played key roles as advisers in Siemens's East
German ventures. Half of the East German staff will be newly
hired, said Siemens officials, while the rest will come from
existing East German companies. Siemens employs 376,000
people world-wide.
   Siemens is expected to be one of the first West German
companies to reap the benefits of German economic union, not
least because the Bonn government is subsidizing the
upgrading of East Germany's rickety telecommunications
system.
