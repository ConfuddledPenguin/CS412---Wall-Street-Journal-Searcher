   In the heat of the controversy surrounding the National
Endowment for the Arts, let me suggest that some interesting
and important economic issues are being overlooked. As a
confirmed capitalist, I am struck by the notion that the arts
-- especially the National Endowment for the Arts -- offer
useful lessons for business.
   Those U.S. corporations that are losing the battle for
global competitiveness today have a few things in common:
short-term focus, bottom-line-only decision making, avoidance
of long-range commitments like research and development, and
fear of risk-taking. Such an approach cripples the
competitive abilities of these companies far more than
foreign trade barriers.

   On the other hand, those companies that have performed the
best in today's fiercely competitive environment are
comfortable with risks and tend to spend more on R&amp;D. These
successful companies have something in common with the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   Even a cursory glance at the NEA's history shows that it
is driven by top-line thinking: Quality comes first. It is
what endures in art and what artists strive for above all
else.
   This benchmark has directed NEA support to an enviable
list of artists and arts organizations that begins with the
American Ballet Theater -- the NEA's first grant recipient,
and extends to John Irving, who wrote "The World According to
Garp" with a NEA Literature Fellowship. There are also grants
to Alice Walker, Billy Taylor, Alvin Ailey, Twyla Tharp, the
St. Louis Symphony, the Houston Opera, Nam June Paik, and
even the Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev., to name just
a few of the 85,000 grantees that have caught my eye.
   Next, the NEA has made certain it provided support for
research and development. It is no accident that all four
Pulitzer Prize winners this year received NEA funds at
important junctures in their careers: Mel Powell for music,
Oscar Hijuelos for fiction, Charles Simic for poetry and
August Wilson for playwriting. In fact, every Pulitzer
Prize-winning play since 1976 received its premiere
production at a nonprofit theater, with NEA support.
   Finally, the NEA has not shied away from risk-taking or
from experimentation. The Dance Theater of Harlem, first
funded through a category called "expansion arts," went on to
achieve national and international acclaim. The Vietnam War
Memorial, today one of the most visited monuments in
Washington, resulted from an NEA design competition that
initially received a significant amount of controversy.
Likewise, the Calder sculpture in Grand Rapids, Mich., was
criticized in its early years but has endured and become a
symbol of civic pride.
   Has the NEA funded artists or arts organizations whose
work was disappointing? Definitely. Its judgments can be and
have been flawed. Sometimes the bet was placed and was lost.
   The same is true of science. For every scientific
experiment that leads to a cure or a spacecraft launched,
there are hundreds, thousands that fizzle, misfire or go up
in smoke. Our government continues to support the efforts of
our scientists through the National Science Foundation,
precisely because we don't know what the outcome will be. It
is through the courage to fail that we achieve eventual
success -- in science, in art, in business.
   There is yet one more point here for business: The arts
and economic vitality appear to be linked in powerful ways.
Almost without exception, the best places for locating
businesses, for job growth, for commercial viability, are
those communities that support their cultural institutions.
   In less than 25 years, the NEA has become an integral part
of not only our cultural life but also our economic vitality.
Along the way, it has exhibited the courage and the vision to
take some risks. And even after tremendous buffeting this
past year, the NEA has remained clear about the true value of
artists to our society.
   Like the Hubble telescope, developed and launched for no
reason more specific than a desire to see and explore, our
artists should be nurtured and their careers launched for no
reason more specific than their need to express, to discover
their individual voices . . . and for our need to hear and
see what they have to show us.
   And just as the Hubble telescope promises to send back new
ways of looking at the universe beyond us, so will our
artists continue to delight, inspire, amuse, infuriate, awe
and sometimes even offend us with new ways of looking at the
world we live in.
   That is top-line thinking. It is a vision worthy of the
support by our nation's leaders in government and in
business.
