   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration announced
that Interpharm Inc., Plainview, N.Y., agreed to withdraw a
generic drug for hypertension because of questions over the
drug's approval process.
   The FDA emphasized that it had no evidence of safety
problems with the drug, clonidine hydrochloride, which is
also made by several other generic-drug manufacturers. But
the agency questioned whether the drug Interpharm placed on
the market is therapeutically equivalent to the brand-name
product on which it is based.

   The recall was the result of findings by the FDA's St.
Louis laboratory that samples of the Interpharm product
submitted for FDA approval weren't the same as the drug that
was subsequently marketed. The FDA said Interpharm will now
audit all its 24 product approvals.
   Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Thomas Bliley Jr. (R.,
Va.) issued a joint statement on this and other recent FDA
recalls, saying they "will undoubtedly add to the list of
seven or more companies being investigated by the U.S.
attorney in Baltimore for fraud and false statements."
Congressional hearings are scheduled this morning on a bill
by the two legislators to stiffen penalties for fraud
committed by generic-drug companies.
   A spokesman for the company, a unit of Interpharm
Laboratories Ltd. of Israel, couldn't be reached for comment.
