   MONTREAL -- BCE Inc., a telecommunications, manufacturing,
financial services and resources concern, said it agreed to
sell most of its 48.9% stake in Encor Inc., a Calgary,
Alberta, oil and gas company, to a group of investment
dealers for subsequent resale.
   After the stock market closed yesterday, BCE said it will
sell 14,850,600 units for seven Canadian dollars (US$5.97)
each to the dealers. Each unit consists of three Encor common
shares and two warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to
purchase from BCE one Encor common share for C$2.65 until
Jan. 21, 1992.

   BCE said it holds 74,253,930 Encor common shares. Upon the
sale of the units, its holding in Encor would be reduced to
29,702,130 shares, or about 19.6%, prior to the exercise of
the warrants. If all the warrants were exercised, BCE said,
its stake would be reduced to less than 1%.
   BCE said it continues to hold 29,850,000 Encor redeemable
convertible preferred shares. These shares are convertible
into 74,618,433 Encor common shares, or about 33% of the
total on a fully diluted basis.
   BCE said the sale of the units is expected to close on or
about July 20. It said proceeds will be used principally to
reduce short-term debt. BCE said the transaction won't have
an immediate effect on earnings.
   Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. and RBC Dominion
Securities Inc., both based in Toronto, are co-managers of
the dealer group, BCE said.
