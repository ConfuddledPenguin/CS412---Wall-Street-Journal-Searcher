   Your "MagiCans" article on June 5 missed the same point
that the Coca-Cola management missed.
   The real problem with MagiCans was that they did not
contain any Coca-Cola] Purchasers expect a can of Coca-Cola
to be a can of Coca-Cola. They buy it because they are
thirsty or need the sugar or the fizz or the caffeine or
whatever they bought it for. When they open it (12 miles down
a dusty road on the way to an important sales call or halfway
up the side of a mountain) they don't expect a can full of
tricks.

   To include promotions is interesting; to substitute them
for the product is dishonest, bad business and stupid. The
real thing may be worth more to the customer than a can with
$10 in it.
