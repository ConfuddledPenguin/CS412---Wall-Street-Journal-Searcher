   WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
fired another volley in its increasingly bitter war against
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In a scathing critique of the SEC's report on the
stock-market plunge of last Oct. 13, CFTC Chairman Wendy
Gramm accused the rival regulator of "selectively omitting"
important data and "misleading" the public about the causes
of the market crash.

   The latest skirmish centers on the October mini-crash in
which the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190.58 points;
almost all of the plunge was during the session's final 80
minutes of trading. Following the decline, both regulatory
agencies sought to determine the cause of the collapse --
often using shared data.
   The conclusions, however, emerged as sharply different in
separate reports released last month. The SEC contended that
program selling on the Chicago futures markets triggered the
6.9% stock-market drop. The securities agency also contended
that traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were net
sellers during most of the collapse, thereby helping to fuel
the stock market's sharp drop.
   The CFTC study disputed that view, contending that
"frequently there were larger concentrations of futures
buying than selling during those periods of pronounced price
declines."
   Because of the odd division over the reports, Rep. Glenn
English (D., Okla.) asked Mrs. Gramm to analyze the SEC
study.
   Yesterday, Mrs. Gramm fired off a scorching attack on the
SEC report. "By selectively omitting critical data from their
analysis, the SEC's report, in specific cases, is
misleading," she wrote to Rep. English, who heads the House
subcommittee that oversees the CFTC. "If the SEC is
attempting to place the blame at the futures market for last
October's volatility, that is like blaming the fire
department for always being found at the scene of the fire."
   Rep. English also was angered over the SEC report. "This
analysis provides clear evidence," he said, "that the SEC's
report is biased against and deficient in its understanding
of futures trading."
   An SEC spokeswoman said the agency wouldn't comment until
it has had a chance to review the CFTC's letter.
   Mrs. Gramm's missive comes at an intense time for the
agency, which is trying to fend off a Bush administration
proposal to shift oversight of stock-index futures to the SEC
from the commodities agency.
   Stock-index futures, which often are used in computerized
program-trading strategies, allow investors to bet on the
movement of a basket of stocks without owning the actual
shares. They are most often used by pension funds and mutual
funds to hedge risk.
   Rep. English contended that the SEC report, which was
written by lawyers in the agency's market-regulation
division, was an attempt to cast the CFTC in a negative
light. The CFTC's response "only confirms what I and other
members of Congress have suspected all along about this
issue," he said. "It's a power grab."
   Mrs. Gramm's nine-page letter offers other rebukes of the
SEC. "If the SEC is implying that the price drop of October
13, 1989, would not have occurred if they had been the sole
regulator of all stock-index derivative markets," she wrote,
"they are making promises they cannot keep."
   Moreover, she said, "by casting price falls as a negative
event, while portraying rises as favorable, the SEC confuses
legitimate price discovery with volatility."
   In other places, she said that the SEC report offered
"virtually no analysis to support" various assertions, and
added that "the facts are contradictory."
