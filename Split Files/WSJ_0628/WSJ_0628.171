   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., in a move to cut costs and create
efficiencies, said it is consolidating its Texas Oil &amp; Gas
Corp. operations with its larger and more profitable Marathon
Oil Co.
   The move was widely anticipated, after USX unsuccessfully
tried to sell all of the assets of Texas Oil &amp; Gas. But
instead of selling all six geographic packages of exploration
and production assets, it now expects to sell only three.

   The unsold properties, including the subsidiaries Delhi
Gas Pipeline Corp. and FWA Drilling Co., will be combined
with Marathon's domestic exploration and production
operations. The two subsidiaries will continue to be managed
from Dallas and Wichita Falls, Texas, respectively.
   The company said it didn't know how many of Texas Oil &amp;
Gas's 2,000 employees would be affected by the consolidation.
But the greatest effect is expected in the unit's Dallas
headquarters staff and in distribution and sales-related
offices in California, Texas, Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast
area. Marathon had about 23,000 employees at year's end.
   USX also said it didn't know what, if any, charges could
be taken as a result of the move, or when the the
consolidation will be complete. A spokesman said the company
hopes savings from the consolidation will offset costs
related to the merged operations.
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said the reorganization will
enable the company to "take advantage of numerous synergies
to reduce costs and optimize our capital budget and
exploration programs in the U.S."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
USX shares closed at $32.75, up 50 cents.
