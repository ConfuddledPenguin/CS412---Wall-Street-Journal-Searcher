   Security Pacific National Bank emerged as the successful
bidder, out of a field that included California's biggest
banks and thrifts, to acquire certain prime assets and
liabilities of Gibraltar Savings, Beverly Hills, Calif., from
the Resolution Trust Corp.
   The Security Pacific Corp. unit will assume about $3.9
billion in core deposits and $2.7 billion of loans covering
one-family to four-family residential housing. Security
Pacific also will gain Gibraltar's premium network of 83
branches in California.

   "This represents an important addition to Security
Pacific's customer base in key California markets," said a
spokesman for Security Pacific.
   Terms weren't disclosed. In a recent precedent, however,
Bank of America paid a price roughly equal to 4% of core
deposits when it acquired Western Savings of Arizona's
assets. By that yardstick, Security Pacific could be paying
about $150 million or more for the thrift.
   A Security Pacific spokesman said the bank expects to
announce additional details of the transaction tomorrow, or
as soon as a definitive agreement is signed with the RTC, the
federal agency that took over the ailing thrift.
   Regulators last year seized the thrift unit, declaring it
insolvent. Gibraltar Financial Corp., the parent of Gibraltar
Savings, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws in February. Since then, nearly a dozen banks
and thrifts have pored over the unit's records and considered
bids but many were believed to have dropped out of the
running earlier this month because of Gibraltar's
deteriorating condition. Security Pacific may have been able
to bid more because it can realize cost savings by closing
down operations and branches that overlap with its existing
facilities.
   Gibraltar Savings, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., was
placed in federal conservatorship after disastrous loans and
investments in commercial real estate and mortgage-backed
securites wiped out its capital. Even with the premium paid
by Security Pacific, the case is expected to cost the
government several hundred million dollars. The RTC retains
all of Gibraltar's multifamily, land and commercial
real-estate loans, amounting to about $2.5 billion.
   Donald Crowley, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods
Inc. in San Francisco, estimated that the sale price of the
Gibraltar assets was in the range of $150 million to $200
million.
   "In general, these deals tend to be running at about 4% of
core assets," he said, citing the Bank of America deal.
   Since Security Pacific bid on $3.9 billion worth of
Gibraltar's total core deposits, without taking any
questionable assets, Mr. Crowley added, "That means they got
the good stuff."
