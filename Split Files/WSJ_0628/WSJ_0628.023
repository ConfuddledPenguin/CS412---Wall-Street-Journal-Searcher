   TOKYO -- Japan's major retail stores reported sales of
1.63 trillion yen ($10.54 billion) in May, up 10.4% from a
weak year-earlier level, but supported by continued strong
consumer demand for a broad range of items, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The high-paced year-to-year growth in May represents a
recovery from low levels a year earlier that owed to the
damping effect on sales of a 3% consumption tax introduced in
April 1989, an MITI official said, estimating that about 4%
of May's sales increase was accounted for by the depressed
year-ago level.
