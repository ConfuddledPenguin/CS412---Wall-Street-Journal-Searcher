   Rothmans International PLC, a British tobacco concern,
reported a 24% rise in its pretax profit in the year to March
31, 1990, helped by an increase in sales and income from its
cash balance.
   The pretax profit of #405 million ($704.5), up from #326
million the year earlier, was above market expectations of a
figure of #395 million.

million from #165 million the previous year. Earnings per
share jumped 23% to 64 pence from 52 pence.

million, because there were no extraordinary items in the
year. The figure was up 16% from #175 million a year earlier,
when the company reported an extraordinary gain of #10.1
million.
   The company plans to pay a final dividend of 9.2 pence a

12.3 pence paid in 1989.
   Operating profit, or profit before tax and interest
income, rose to #363 million, up 23% from #295 million. Total
