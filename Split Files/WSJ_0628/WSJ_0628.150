   French auto maker Peugeot S.A. said it expects
consolidated revenue for 1990 to exceed the 7.9% gain it
reported for the first quarter, when sales totaled 44.14
billion francs ($7.90 billion).
   Jacques Calvet, chairman of the French auto group, didn't
specify the scope of the expected improvement, but he said it
would reflect catching up on production lost to a flood in
one of the group's main plants in February, as well as the
success of new models launched in the luxury end of the car
market during 1989.

   Mr. Calvet didn't forecast full-year earnings or cash
flow, although he said he wouldn't be disappointed if
consolidated 1990 cash flow came in close to the 1989 level
of 18.553 billion francs.
   Calvet also said the net treasury position of the group
showed a surplus of between 1.5 billion and 2 billion francs.
As reported, Peugeot was a net debtor until the end of 1989.
   For all of 1989, Peugeot's consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests was 10.30 billion francs on
revenue of 152.96 billion francs.
