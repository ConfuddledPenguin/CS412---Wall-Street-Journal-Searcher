   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- The most feared gambler on the
boardwalk is a mysterious Japanese baccarat player known as
"The Warrior." He bets $200,000 a hand -- $14 million an hour
-- in spans up to 14 hours. A private chef prepares his
favorite foods: BLT sandwiches and marinated monkey meat.
   Yet so little is known about him that a credit review
circulated among casino officials lists his profession as
"Business." No one knows how he made his money. And even
Donald Trump, his host in an ocean-front casino penthouse,
says, "I don't really know where the hell he comes from."

   His name is Akio Kashiwagi and he is high risk incarnate.
He won $6 million at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in
February, then lost $9.4 million in May when Mr. Trump lured
him back -- after hiring consultants to figure out how to
beat him.
   Mr. Kashiwagi, 53 years old, is Mr. Trump's reclusive
opposite, avoiding interviews and photographers. He runs his
Tokyo real estate business from a shabby two-story building
far removed from the glamour of Trump Plaza. Sipping tea amid
tuxedo-clad barracat croupiers, Mr. Kashiwagi, in his rumpled
blue-striped shirt and plain black slippers, has the the look
of a quarter slot-machine player just off the bus from
Hoboken.
   He throws around $5,000 casino chips with the composure of
someone playing penny pinochle. Flanked by a bodyguard, he
often smiles even when losing. "He plays only for fun," says
Darryl Yong, an aide to Mr. Kashiwagi. Yet he bets more in an
hour than 100,000 typical visitors wager collectively.
   Mr. Trump ordered his guest's private table roped off in
red velvet. He provided hot face towels and allowed him
exclusive use of a nearby casino bathroom. "He's great, the
best in the world," says Mr. Trump.
   Mr. Kashiwagi is a steady player, never varying his bet
whether winning or losing. At one point in last month's
marathon, he lost 11 straight hands at $200,000 each without
flinching. He takes notes describing the results of each
hand, and casino officials rate his skill as excellent. But
unlike many baccarat players, he often seems to bet on
hunches -- without any pattern or concern about how the cards
are going.
   In the parlance of the casino industry, a huge bettor like
Mr. Kashiwagi is a "whale," which surely makes Mr. Trump his
Ahab. Call him crazy, but Mr. Trump wants his croupiers to
play another baccarat marathon with Mr. Kashiwagi. For how
much? "Unlimited. Anything he wants to do," says Mr. Trump --
although his employees say there would certainly be limits.
   The ideal date for the contest would be Dec. 7, the
anniversary of Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, says
Edward Tracy, president of operations at Mr. Trump's three
casinos in Atlantic City. For advice on making that a day of
infamy for Mr. Kashiwagi, Mr. Tracy is being advised by Jess
Marcum, a mathematician he says "helped develop the atomic
bomb. If he's that good, he can help us beat Kashiwagi."
   Mr. Marcum, nicknamed "The Atheist" by gambling industry
officials because he doesn't believe in luck, only in his
calculations of odds, says he actually helped with the
neutron bomb after World War II. Close enough, says Mr.
Tracy.
   Mr. Trump has also hired Al Glasgow, a gambling industry
consultant, to help size up Mr. Kashiwagi. "He's a real
samurai. He craves a challenge," says Mr. Glasgow. "When he's
taking a break, he'd just as soon sleep on a cot."
   But Trump Plaza provides better: a penthouse suite with
three bedrooms, three baths -- sauna, two butlers and a
pianist. The living room features a smiling jade Buddha
valued at $800,000.
   Not bad, considering that virtually nothing is known about
the true size of Mr. Kashiwagi's bankroll, where it comes
from or how good his credit really is. He was born the son of
a carpenter in a small city near Mount Fuji. One of his first
jobs is said to have been guiding tourists around the
mountain. An older brother, who works for a textile company,
says he doesn't know how his sibling became rich.
   His modest combination house and office near a busy Tokyo
intersection is just down a hill from the offices of Japan's
Diet. Only a small gold colored sign indicates there's a
business inside. Foreign luxury cars are often parked nearby.
In his hometown, Kawaguchiko, he lives in a huge house known
locally as "Kashiwagi Palace."
   He claims $1 billion in assets and income of about $100
million a year. He describes his company, Kashiwagi Shoji
Co., as a real estate and investment concern in which he is
the only principal. His assistant, Mr. Yong, politely brushed
aside a request by this newspaper for details.
   A 1988 report by Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd., a data base of
companies in Japan, shows Mr. Kashiwagi's company with sales
of just $15 million and five employees. An official at the
company says it has about 30 workers now; he declines to
discuss sales. Mr. Kashiwagi isn't listed among the top 30
taxpayers in his district last year, according to Japanese
government records, and tax officials won't talk about
individuals' payments.
   Mr. Kashiwagi took up his heavy gambling hobby about three
years ago, according to Mr. Yong. His biggest win, $19
million in a week, came last February at the Diamond Beach
Casino in Darwin, Australia.
   There, too, he played baccarat, a card game similar to
blackjack in which the winning hand is the one closest to a
point total of nine. Face cards and tens aren't counted.
Baccarat has snob appeal because it has higher minimum bets
than other casino games -- typically $20. But minimums don't
interest Mr. Kashiwagi: Mr. Trump's casino is the only one in
Atlantic City that granted his request for $200,000 a hand.
   Smarting from his $6 million loss to Mr. Kashiwagi in 10
hours last February, Mr. Trump sought a better strategy in
May. His consultants, Messrs. Glasgow and Marcum, suggested
enticing their guest to play longer this time. They proposed
a so-called freeze-out agreement, under which Mr. Kashiwagi
wouldn't quit until he either doubled an initial $12 million
or lost it all. The arrangement isn't binding -- New Jersey
gaming laws permit a player to quit at any time.
   But the freeze-out agreement psychologically snared Mr.
Kashiwagi, says Trump Plaza's Mr. Tracy: "His nostrils were
wide open; he was hooked and going down."
   Mr. Marcum calculated that the casino's risk doesn't
increase with the size of the hand. All that matters, given
the slight 1.25% advantage the rules give the casino in each
hand, is that the customer play long enough to lose
everything. Mr. Marcum's pages of hand-written charts show
that after one hour of play, or about 70 hands, the customer
has a 46% chance of being ahead. After 75 hours, or 5,250
hands, the customer's chance of winning falls to 15%.
   Sure enough, Mr. Kashiwagi was ahead $5.5 million on his
third day at the table. "It was beautiful," recalls Mr. Yong.
But by 4 a.m. on the sixth day, after 5,056 hands in 70 hours
of play, Mr. Kashiwagi was $9.4 million behind.
   Mr. Kashiwagi then left in a huff, tipping poorly and
threatening to burn his autographed copy of Mr. Trump's "The
Art of the Deal."
   Mr. Kashiwagi's people contend that Trump officials broke
the freeze-out agreement by ending the game while they were
ahead. Trump officials say Mr. Kashiwagi quit.
   The Trump casino had advanced Mr. Kashiwagi a $6 million
line of credit to be used only for gambling. But on the way
to his limousine, Mr. Kashiwagi quietly cashed in $474,000 in
chips. He has agreed to pay back everything except that. (He
has also recently paid up for $3 million in losses at the Las
Vegas Hilton.)
   Sources close to Mr. Trump say he'll agree to let his
whale keep that money in hopes he'll return and blow his
stake again. They say Mr. Kashiwagi probably can't resist a
chance for revenge, and Mr. Trump is extending an open
invitation.
   But Mr. Yong says Mr. Kashiwagi will never forgive the
indignities he suffered. For instance, he says, Mr. Trump's
guarantee of credit at Macy's in Atlantic City proved
worthless. Mr. Kashiwagi left the department store in
humiliation without his $5,000 in clothes and other
purchases. Trump officials insist it was a misunderstanding
and say the items were delivered later to their guest's
suite.
   Not good enough, says Mr. Yong, slipping in a dig at their
debt-ridden host. "We pity Mr. Trump's creditors," he says.
"No wonder if they panic."
   Mr. Yong says all this has left Mr. Kashiwagi disenchanted
with baccarat, and his new hobbies will be golf and a
Japanese version of chess. How much he'll bet on those isn't
known.
