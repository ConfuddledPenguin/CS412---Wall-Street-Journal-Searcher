   United Companies Financial Corp. said it has signed a
letter of intent with the Resolution Trust Corp. to acquire
most of the assets of Foster Mortgage Corp., a
mortgage-servicing company based in Fort Worth, Texas.
   United Companies, based in Baton Rouge, La., is a
financial-services holding company. Foster is a unit of
Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings Association, a
Houston-based thrift that is under the conservatorship of the
RTC, the federal agency that is selling off assets seized in
the thrift-industry bailout.

   Foster currently services about $8 billion in mortgage
loans, and United Companies said the purchase price will be
based on the mortgage-loan balances at closing. An RTC
spokeswoman said the agency hopes to close the sale within 90
days.
