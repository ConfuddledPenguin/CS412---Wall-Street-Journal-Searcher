   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- BMA Corp. said its shareholders at the
annual meeting approved the sale of its insurance business to
Italy's Generali-Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A.
   The pact calls for Generali to pay $157 million in cash
for BMA's Business Men's Assurance Co. of America subsidiary.
The deal also calls for the unit to transfer assets to BMA
that have a book value of $128 million, BMA said. The
transaction is expected to close in late July.
