   Has airline pricing become so sophisticated that it
outstrips antitrust law?
   The country's cornerstone of antitrust legislation, the
1890 Sherman Act, was written to rein in the industrial
revolution's robber barons and monopolists. But the law may
be beginning to show some limitations as the information age
flowers.

   The airline industry is the leading case. It has poured
hundreds of millions of dollars into developing computer
systems that not only allow carriers to track millions of
reservations, but also, in essence, let them vote on whether
they will go along with fare increases or cuts, critics say.
   Antitrust specialists say that the only way to prove
collusion is to discover a secret agreement. In order to
prosecute a signalling case, the Justice Department has "a
long row to hoe," says Charles F. Rule, former assistant
attorney general of the Justice Department's antitrust
division.
   Years ago, the courts had a broader interpretation of what
constituted an agreement. In a case against American Tobacco
in the mid-1940s, the court ruled that an antitrust agreement
could be inferred when companies had a "meeting of the minds"
and were "working together understandably" to achieve a
common objective.
   In more recent years, the courts have narrowed their view.
In a 1974 case against General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co., the Sixth District Court in Michigan ruled that
companies could legally come to the same decision
independently based on competitive reasons. It held that
companies are acting legally as long as their actions are
"consistent with rational business behaviour and prevailing
economic conditions."
   Also, the court ruled that it isn't illegal for a company
to raise its prices in the hope that the action will prompt
competitors to "go further or for the purpose of testing the
marketplace to determine whether further unilateral action is
possible."
   When matching another carrier's fares, airlines say they
are doing so for "competitive reasons." That type of
behavior, the courts say, is "mere conscious parallelism."
   In another 1974 government case, this one against Du Pont,
the court said that the companies charged with price fixing
weren't guilty because they were able to defend their actions
with competitive explanations.
   Enforcement can be difficult even in cases that involve
direct contact. The Justice Department didn't get a guilty
verdict in the celebrated case in which American Airlines'
Robert Crandall used a telephone to propose a fare hike to
competitor Braniff. Instead, American settled the case
without denying or admitting guilt.
   In that case, Mr. Crandall told Howard Putnam, then
chairman of Braniff, that it was "dumb as hell" for the
carriers to pound each other with cutthroat low fares in
Dallas, according to a transcript of the conversation.
