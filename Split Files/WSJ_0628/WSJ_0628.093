   HUTCHINSON, Kan. -- Collins Industries Inc. said it
received a one-year contract to provide ambulances valued at
about $12 million to the U.S. General Services
Administration.
   Collins, a maker of specialty vehicles, said the contract
gives the GSA the option of placing two additional one-year
orders. The company said that if the agency exercises those
options, Collins would provide a total of about 1,200
ambulances with a value of about $60 million.
