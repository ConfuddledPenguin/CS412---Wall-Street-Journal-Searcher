   Times Mirror Co., Los Angeles, said it expects
second-quarter operating results to be the same as in the
first quarter because of depressed newspaper advertising
revenue and higher costs resulting from Los Angeles Times'
circulation gains.
   First-quarter operating profit fell 27% to $94.2 million
from $129.6 million. Net income fell 33% to $46 million, or
36 cents a share, on revenue of $875.2 million.

   Times Mirror wouldn't comment on its earnings expectations
for 1990. In last year's second quarter, net rose 7.6% to $85
million, or 66 cents a share.
   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive officer,
said it appears that the advertising softness and higher
costs affecting its newspaper group will "offset the strong
contributions of our professional publishing and cable
television operations" in the latest period.
   Ad revenue from the newspaper group fell 0.7% to $131.4
million from $132.4 million for the four weeks ended June 3.
For the 22 weeks ended June 3 ad revenue fell 1.7% to $713.6
million from $726.2 million. The latest results included 22
Sundays, one fewer than a year earlier.
