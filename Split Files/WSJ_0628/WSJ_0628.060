   I was appalled by Charlotte Low Allen's May 14
editorial-page article, "Ending Abuse of Death Penalty
Appeals." In Mrs. Allen's zeal to shorten the path to the
electric chair, she conveniently overlooks the basic problems
with capital punishment as we now practice it. While
complaining that federal habeas corpus appeals are too
time-consuming, she neglects to mention that one-half of all
state-imposed death sentences have been overturned by federal
courts due to constitutional errors at trial that lower
courts refused to correct. I find troubling the implication
that due process for those accused of terrible crimes is not
worth our time.
   Believing that courts should not address errors "that the
defendant's lawyers did not raise properly," she sees no
inequity in sending a criminal defendant to his death for the
inadequacies of his attorney. It is beyond question that
those who populate death row are poor and were generally
represented by inexperienced lawyers who did not want to take
the unpopular, undercompensated cases. One of the last
executions in Alabama was of a man whose lawyer did not even
bother to appeal his flawed death sentence to the state
appellate court. There have been many instances of
co-defendants on death row, one of whose lawyers raised a
constitutional violation and won a new, fair trial for his
client, while the other failed to raise the very same issue
and sent his client to the executioner. Is this evenhanded
justice? If Mrs. Allen is so anxious for the process to
proceed more quickly, I wonder that she is not more concerned
with providing adequate representation for these people in
the first instance.

   The Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1974
because it found that it was no longer applied in an
arbitrary fashion. Yet what could be more arbitrary than the
recent decision in Teague v. Lane, which held that whether a
prisoner can get relief from an unconstitutionally imposed
death sentence depends on the date his state-court appeals
ended. Thus, of two prisoners whose juries were selected in
the same racially discriminatory manner or whose judges gave
exactly the same improper jury instruction, one may be
executed and one granted a new trial.
   Mrs. Allen also objects to a proposed reform measure out
of a misguided notion that it would "bring racial quotas to
state death penalty laws. . . ." My understanding of the
Racial Justice Act is that it would forestall an execution
only where a prisoner presented concrete evidence that his
sentence was obtained due to racial bias, and that the state
could then rebut that evidence. I for one would not be
comfortable saying an execution should proceed in the face of
undisputed evidence of racism.
   Mrs. Allen's article appears based more on a need for
quick vengeance than careful administration of the laws. No
matter how ugly or distressing the crime, everyone deserves a
truly fair trial: Our Constitution and our consciences demand
no less.

   What will be accomplished by killing prisoners quickly?
Why the urgency? Why should their appeals be limited, when
others' appeals have no limits? Are appeals for life worth
less than other crimes or civil offenses? Are the judicial
systems of our states, particularly in the South, of such
high quality that federal oversight through habeas corpus
petitions can be decreased?
   My eight years' study of death-sentencing, particularly in
Virginia, has shown me that it is stacked in favor of
prosecutors. They decide without any regulation or controls
who will be charged with a capital offense. Their decisions
are mainly motivated by political interests. They select
poor, chiefly minority and most often mentally deficient
people. These defendants are given untrained court-appointed
attorneys of questionable skills who in turn are given a few
hundred dollars to conduct a defense against prosecutors with
considerable resources. (Surveys of death-row prisoners show
that they all had court-appointed attorneys.) Only jurors who
believe in killing prisoners are allowed in both the guilt
and sentencing parts of capital trials.
   Class prejudice also can be added to the unfairness in
death-sentencing. Former Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas said: "One searches in vain for the execution of any
member of the affluent strata of our society." Former Gov.
Michael DiSall of Ohio once said: "During my experience as
governor . . . I found the men on death row had one thing in
common: They were penniless. The fact that they had no money
was a principal factor in their being condemned to death."
   And then there is race prejudice. The General Accounting
Office issued a report in March that concluded there are
"racial disparities in the charging, sentencing, and
imposition of the death penalty." It also found that those
who kill whites were more likely to be sentenced to death
than those who murder blacks. Last year, the Rehnquist court
held that racial prejudice was "an inevitable part of the
criminal-justice process."
   Mrs. Allen's commentary failed to present any part of this
dark side of the death-sentencing process. She also had some
faulty comments. She leads us to think that because Robert
Alton Harris's wife testified against him that he must be
worthy of his death sentence ("Suffice it to say. . . .").
Also, she leads us to conclude that because a probation
officer attributed Mr. Harris's 1971 abnormal EEG to
glue-sniffing, then this must be the explanation for this
medical finding.
   Given these limitations, defects and prejudices of the
judicial process, why the mindless rush to kill a few poor,
and most often emotionally unstable, prisoners who were not
adequately defended in the first place? More important, why
the moral and ethical blindness to the inhumanness, cruelty,
hatred and malevolence that are at the core of this savagery?
Why the coldbloodedness of mind and heart? Why can't our
judicial and other community leaders teach us about goodness,
the value of human life, and that working to end pain and
suffering is more important than working for violence and
death?
