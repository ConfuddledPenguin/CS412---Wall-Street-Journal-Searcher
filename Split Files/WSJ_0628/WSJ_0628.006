   NEW YORK -- New construction contracts rose 6% in May from
a four-year low in April, reflecting a surge in contracting
for public works projects, according to F.W. Dodge, the
forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.
   Contracts for nonresidential building rose 6% from April
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $82.89 billion.
Residential building contracts, for newly started one-family
homes and apartments, edged up 4% to $110.55 billion.
Nonbuilding construction-public works and utilities, climbed
12% to $50.88 billion, its best level so far in 1990.

   Dodge said three waterway development projects being built
by the U.S. Corps of Engineers in Oregon, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania gave an added lift to the generally improved
level of building activity.
   The Dodge index, which compares current contracting levels
against a 1982 base of 100, rebounded to 155 in May from 147
in April. Despite the stronger index, the year-to-date
contracting total of $97.29 billion remained 7% below the
comparable five-month period of 1989.
   George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for
F.W. Dodge, said, "It appears that the recent slide of
construction contracting may be stabilizing at about 10%
below last year's value."
   The steepest decline in year-to-date value was in the
Northeast, where newly started construction was 24% below the
comparable five-month period of 1989. The greatest gain was
5% in the North Central region. The West remained even, while
the South was down 10%.
