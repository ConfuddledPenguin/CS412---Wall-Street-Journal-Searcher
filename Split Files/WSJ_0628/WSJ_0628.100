   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court justices grappled with
real-world business issues in the term that ended yesterday,
and their rulings had an immediate impact on billions of
dollars of corporate funds as well as state and federal
government tax revenue.
   "The impact of the court's decisions this term has been
far more acute in the economic world than at any time in
memory," says Bruce Fein, a Washington lawyer and
conservative legal columnist.

   The court's 129 decisions in the term that began last
October had a significant monetary effect in three business
areas: federal pension regulation, state and federal
taxation, and antitrust law.
   The court is accustomed to deciding legal issues without
much concern for the impact on daily business transactions.
Warren Burger, who retired as chief justice in 1986, was the
last justice to openly worry about how the release of certain
decisions might affect trading in particular stocks.
   But, according to Mr. Fein, the court handled this term's
high stakes issues well. "On economic issues, the court is
far more sophisticated than in previous years as to how
businesses operate," he says.
   The early indications are that major decisions affecting
business will continue next term. The court already has
agreed to decide whether the Constitution's "due process"
guarantee requires limits on the amount of punitive damage
awards in civil lawsuits. And the justices will decide
whether federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination in
employment prevent companies from barring women of
child-bearing age from some hazardous jobs.
   In the pension case, the court upheld the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp.'s authority to get tough with companies that
are looking to bail out on big, troubled pension plans. The
court upheld the PBGC's order to LTV Corp. to reassume
liability for more than $2 billion in pension benefits that
the company stopped funding in 1987 when it filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   The ruling immediately restored some stability to the
PBGC, a federal insurance corporation that is operating with
a $1 billion deficit. The PBGC and industry analysts had
warned that a ruling against the agency would have encouraged
numerous other troubled companies in the steel, auto and
airline industries to adopt similar tactics to cut their
losses. This would have driven the PBGC deficit up to $7.8
billion, agency officials said, and almost certainly would
have required a congressional bailout.
   "I think the court looked at the S&amp;L situation and said
we're not going to have a bailout saddled on us," says Mr.
Fein.
   But if the PBGC case averted having billions of dollars in
liability change hands, the high court's tax decisions
produced an immediate upheaval. The court ruled that states
must provide refunds to taxpayers who were required to pay
taxes that the state should have known, on the basis of
existing court precedents or federal laws, were
unconstitutional.
   State taxing officials have estimated that states face
potential refunds of $6.5 billion in cases in which taxes
already have been declared unconstitutional or in lawsuits
that are pending. In at least 24 states, for example, refund
lawsuits totaling $2 billion have been filed over
unconstitutional state taxation of the pensions of retired
federal workers. The high court has said the states can't tax
federal pensions while exempting those of state and local
retirees.
   In a federal tax decision, the justices ruled on a foreign
tax-credit issue that could have cost the government $900
million in corporate tax refunds if the Internal Revenue
Service had lost. Siding with the IRS, however, the court
said the legal definition of taxable accumulated profits for
multinational companies should be based on U.S. law, not on
deductions allowed by foreign governments.
   On federal antitrust issues, the court changed the way
companies must go about seeking government approval for
mergers. In the past, companies proposing takeovers were able
to ignore state attorneys general and negotiate only with
federal officials, who have been generally favorably disposed
to mergers. By ruling that states may sue in federal court to
seek to dismantle anti-competitive mergers, the justices
forced companies to clear their deals in advance with state
attorneys general or risk court-ordered divestiture.
   In the business world, however, cases that the court
refuses to hear often have an impact, too. That was
especially true this term in the area of securities law.
   The justices let stand a federal appeals court ruling
barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from approving
trading of new stock "basket" products that allow investors
to trade a cross-section of the stock market. The justices
also let stand an appeals court ruling barring Massachusetts
from interfering with the standard arbitration agreements
that brokerages require customers to sign. And the high court
left intact an appeals court ruling upholding a Wisconsin
securities law that imposes significant procedural hurdles on
hostile tender offers.
