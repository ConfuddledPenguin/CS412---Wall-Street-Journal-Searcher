   WAYNE, N.J. -- Union Camp Corp. said it will form an
employee stock ownership plan with $160 million in new
convertible preferred stock.
   The manufacturer of paper, packaging and wood-based
chemicals, said the plan will cover salaried employees and be
part of their existing savings and investment plan. After the
issuance of the preferred stock, Union Camp plans to buy back
as many as 4.5 million shares of its common stock in periodic
open-market transactions. Union Camp has 68.9 million common
shares outstanding.

   The ESOP and terms of the convertible preferred stock will
be completed within a month, the company said.
   Some companies have issued convertible preferred stock to
ESOPs in order to put stakes in friendly hands, a maneuver
that helps thwart takeover attempts. But analysts said Union
Camp's explanation for the move -- simply to "further align
the interests of employees with those of our shareholders" --
was the more likely motive.
   With the overall decline in takeover activity, the use of
ESOPs as anti-takeover devices "is pretty much dead," says
Lawrence Ross, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Separately, Union Camp said it has developed a new
paper-bleaching process that greatly reduces the amount of
chlorinated organic waste, including dioxin and chloroform.
   The company said it plans to install the new technology as
part of a $158 million modernization of its Franklin, Va.,
pulp and fine-paper plant. The process, for which Union Camp
said it is seeking a patent, will help it comply with new
Virginia water-quality standards, the company said.
Installation is expected to be completed in the second half
of 1992.
