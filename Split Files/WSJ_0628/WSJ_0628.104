   Investors took some of their cash out of money market
mutual funds in the latest week, as yields didn't budge.
   The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes
reinvestment of dividends, remained at 7.96%, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Assets of the 431 taxable
funds tracked by the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter
slipped by $611 million to $378.9 billion in the week ended
Tuesday.

   Most of the withdrawals were from funds open only to
institutions, said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's.
She said some of that cash may have been invested directly in
short-term Treasury securities. Yields on Treasury bills sold
at Monday's auction were about a tenth of a percentage point
higher than on the average money fund.
   Money funds invest in such things as Treasury bills,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit. Average maturity of the funds'
investments remained at 44 days, indicating no substantial
change in yields any time soon.
   Average maturity has been 43 or 44 days for nearly three
months. The average seven-day compound yield has been at or
slightly below 8% since late January.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.67%. The average 30-day simple yield again was
7.67% and the average 30-day compound yield stayed at 7.96%
for the second consecutive week.
   Yields on tax-exempt funds rose slightly, although assets
fell. The average seven-day compound yield of the tax-free
funds, for instance, increased to 5.45% from 5.40%. That's
equivalent to 7.57% for someone in the 28% tax bracket and to
8.13% for those paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of 222 tax-exempt funds declined to $75.9 billion
from $76.1 billion. Average maturity lengthened to 43 days
from 40.
