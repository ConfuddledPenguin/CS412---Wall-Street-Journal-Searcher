   HOUSTON -- Sysco Corp. said the Justice Department
launched a probe of possible bid-rigging involving several
companies, including Sysco, which all provide food services
to southeast Texas schools.
   The big food-service concern said the investigation
involves its Sysco Food Services Inc. subsidiary, which
distributes food and related products to schools and other
organizations in the Houston area. The company said the unit
received a subpoena from a federal grand jury here about five
weeks ago requesting certain records.

   Sysco said it complied fully and opened an internal
investigation as well. It said it also offered to compensate
customers for any overcharges should the allegations prove
true.
   "Sysco has always prided itself on being a corporation
whose entire family of companies is committed to ethical and
lawful business practices," said John F. Woodhouse, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Analysts and company officials said the amount of money
involved is likely to be minimal. Sysco said that the unit
accounts for just 3% of total company revenue and that the
unit's public-schools business accounts for 7% of its sales
volume.
   The stock market appeared to be unconcerned about the
probe. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Sysco shares closed at $35, up $1.375.
   It couldn't be learned which other food-service companies
have been targeted by the probe.
   An official with the U.S. attorney's office here confirmed
the investigation but wouldn't elaborate.
