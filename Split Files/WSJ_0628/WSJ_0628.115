   CONSOLIDATED FREIGHTWAYS Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) --
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on
senior debt of this transportation company. The rating
concern said its action affects about $275 million in
long-term debt. Separately, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it
put on its CreditWatch list with negative implications $425
million of Consolidated Freightways' debt. Moody's lowered
its ratings on the company's senior debt to Baa-3 from
single-A-3 and on commercial paper to prime-3 from prime-2,
citing reduced financial flexibility, a difficult operating
environment, and diminished bondholder protection in light of
a proposed senior bank credit agreement. Continuing losses at
Consolidated Freightways' Emery Worldwide unit also were a
factor in the rating change, Moody's said. S&amp;P placed on
Creditwatch the company's senior debt and industrial revenue
bonds, rated triple-B, and commercial paper, rated
single-A-2. S&amp;P also cited Emery's losses and the new bank
credit facility, as well as continuing poor prospects for a
profit turnaround. The diversified company has operations in
trucking and air freight.

   COOPER COS. (New York) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered
its rating on $79 million of subordinated debt to
triple-C-plus from single-B and removed Cooper from its
CreditWatch list. S&amp;P said the downgrade reflects the
"uncertain nature" of planned acquisitions. It said the
company has reduced debt and created a $180 million pool of
liquid investments by divesting itself of most operating
assets. The ratings agency said the remaining businesses, a
small contact lens unit and a cryosurgical equipment unit,
could provide a base for re-entry into the eye-care market.

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
downgraded its rating on this city's $76.9 million of general
obligation bonds to Baa-1 from single-A. The rating concern
attributed its action to the "rapid weakening of the city's
financial position since fiscal year 1988," which caused "a
significant projected fiscal year-end 1990 general fund
deficit." Moody's also cited "the slowing regional economy,
large capital needs and below-average socioeconomic base."
