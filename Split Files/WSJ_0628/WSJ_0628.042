   NEIMAN MARCUS GROUP INC. said its board approved a plan
allowing shareholders to reinvest their dividends to purchase
more stock. General Cinema Corp., which has a controlling
interest in Neiman Marcus and annually receives $22.5 million
in preferred dividends and $3.3 million in common dividends,
said it will reinvest its dividends in the retailer. General
Cinema, based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., has interests in
specialty retailing and also owns movie theaters. General
Cinema currently owns 50% of Neiman Marcus's common stock and
all of its preferred stock, which is convertible to an
additional 9.9% of common stock. Neiman Marcus will use the
cash from the dividend reinvestment plan to shore up its
capital position, renovate stores and clear debt.
