   The headline on your June 4 editorial was "Stalking
Rosty." In nostalgic reminiscence, President Bush might
suggest another headline: "Voodoo Too."
   In the editorial you advocate the ultimate liberalization
of a federal entitlement program by paying full Social
Security retirement benefits to seniors under 70 who are not
retired. These are people who never paid a nickel into Social
Security without the condition that they meet the act's
definition of retirement before they could receive retirement
benefits.

   How do you get the $26 billion to pay for this giveaway?
The same way they got the $1.75 billion to pay for the mainly
upper-bracket income-tax cut and the trillion-dollar net
spending increase during the first Reagan term. Simply dust
off the "laughable" curve, rosy up the assumptions and just
say no to reality.
   Reality and the Social Security actuaries say that
substantial liberalizations of the retirement test in the
past have produced no significant increases in tax receipts
from earnings of Social Security retirees. Reality has also
falsified the rosy assumption that as a consequence of the
Kemp-Roth-Laffer alchemy of 1981, harder work and greater
income-tax collections would balance the budget by 1984.
   You suggest that obeying long-established law that denies
retirement benefits to seniors who are not retired amounts to
an unjust taxation of those seniors. Here we apparently need
a primer on the difference between the apples of government
taxes and the oranges of government benefits. The government
collects the former and pays out the latter. The seniors who
fail the retirement test do not have something taken from
them by taxation. They simply are not given something that is
not owed them. If a car dealership won't give you an
automobile you never paid for, it is not taxing you $10,000.
   Contrary to calculated myth, there is nothing in the
Social Security law that prohibits a senior citizen from
working full time. There is and always has been something in
the Social Security law that prohibits a senior citizen from
working full time and pretending to be retired.
   The retirement test is, in essence, the definition of
part-time work. Not only is that test indexed for wage
inflation, but the federal government has recently
liberalized the test in real dollars and is about to do so
again with my full support and that of Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, whose "limousine," by the way, is as much a
fantasy as the rest of your editorial.
   But to repeal the retirement requirement altogether would
mean that those senior professional and business people who
have already chosen continued six-figure incomes instead of,
say, $12,000 Social Security benefits would suddenly hit a
big Social Security Lotto -- without ever having purchased a
ticket. Whoopee.
