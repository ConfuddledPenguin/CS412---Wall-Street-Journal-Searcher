   Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc., Allentown, Pa., said it
acquired a 49% interest in Sapio Industrie, an Italian
producer of industrial gases with annual revenue of about
$100 million.
   Terms weren't disclosed.

<TEXT>
   The acquisition of the Sapio stake follows a string of
other European investments made by Air Products since the
mid-1980s that total more than $500 million. In April, for
example, Air Products increased its stake in Carburos
Metalicos, the largest industrial gas supplier in Spain and
Portugal, to about 30%. The expansion effort in Europe has
effectively doubled the company's asset base there.
   The company said four Air Products executives, including
two European vice presidents and the general manager of the
company's own Milan-based operation, will become members of
Sapio's nine-member board.
