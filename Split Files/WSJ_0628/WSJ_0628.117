   American Healthcare Management Inc. said it will move its
corporate headquarters from Dallas to a western suburb of
Philadelphia by Oct. 1.
   Steven Volla, president of the operator of hospitals, said
the move will allow the company to take on a new management
team in the wake of its emergence late last year from
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws.

   Mr. Volla said about 15 members of American Healthcare's
current management team will relocate to the Philadelphia
area, and about 35 people working in the Dallas office will
be laid off.
