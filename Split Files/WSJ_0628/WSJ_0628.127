   Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, said it filed applications
with the comptroller of the currency to consolidate the
charters of its five Pennsylvania banks.
   The bank holding company said the move would simplify its
corporate financial and legal structure, and enable customers
to cash checks and do all banking at any of the 353 Mellon
Bank branch offices statewide. The company said the move
wouldn't affect the management structure, boards or employees
of the banks.

   Mellon said these banks would be consolidated into a
single bank called Mellon Bank N.A.: Commonwealth National
Bank, Harrisburg; Mellon Bank (Central), State College;
Mellon Bank (East), Philadelphia; Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh;
and Mellon Bank (North), Oil City. Mellon also said it plans
to change Commonwealth National Bank's name to Mellon Bank.
The company expects the consolidation to be completed by
early next year.
