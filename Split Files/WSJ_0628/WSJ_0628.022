   The Wisconsin Supreme Court narrowly declined to hear a
challenge to the state's controversial school-voucher law, in
a first-round legal victory for public-school adversaries.
   The battle over the law, the first that allows direct
public funding for private education, is being closely
watched by educators as a guidepost for school reform. A
growing number of radical reformers have argued that only a
free-market system using vouchers can correct what they
regard as the widespread failure of public schools. Teachers
and school officials, meanwhile, argue that vouchers will
lead to educational inequity and racial segregation.

   The Wisconsin Supreme Court didn't weigh in on these
issues, ruling only in its 4-3 decision that opponents to the
law must first go to a lower court, which they did yesterday.
But backers of the law, including Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, were heartened because the Supreme Court is
expected to hear the case on appeal, no matter who wins in
lower courts.
   The plaintiff opponents include the local affiliates of
the National Education Association and the American
Federation of Teachers, the country's two largest teachers
unions; the Milwaukee branch of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People; the state parent-teacher
association, and the Wisconsin Association of School District
Administrators.
   "I was disappointed for obvious reasons -- this is a
matter of substantial national and statewide concern," said
Robert Friebert, an attorney for the plaintiff group. But Mr.
Friebert said he was encouraged that Nathan S. Heffernan, the
state's chief justice, simultaneously urged lower courts to
hear the case quickly. Without a court ruling against the
law, students will begin using the vouchers this September.
   The law, passed in March, will allow as many as 1,000
students from low-income families to opt for private
nonsectarian schools in Milwaukee with state support. The
private schools will receive $2,500 in state funds for each
student they enroll.
   The main advocates of the law are Mr. Thompson, a white
Republican, and state Rep. Polly Williams, a black Democrat
who is eager to aid private schools serving black and
Hispanic children in her district. Opponents say the law
violates the state constitution because it would divert
public money to a private purpose without adequate controls.
   Separately, several schools that stand to benefit under
the law are seeking an injunction from a state court in
Milwaukee that would block the Wisconsin school
superintendent, Herbert J. Grover, from disqualifying them
for the vouchers. Mr. Grover wants written assurances, which
he hasn't yet received, that the schools will provide
services to the handicapped.
   After the supreme court decision late Tuesday, the law's
opponents filed to combine their case with the schools' case.
A hearing on the schools' lawsuit is scheduled for today.
