   TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Andlinger &amp; Co. said it purchased Chase
Chemical Co. The price wasn't disclosed.
   The private investment firm's acquisition appears to
indicate that Chase Chemical will fare well in its legal
fight to introduce a generic version of Pfizer Inc.'s
blood-pressure drug Procardia, a hugely profitable product
with about $400 million in annual sales.

   Chase Chemical is a Newark, N.J., maker and marketer of
pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement products.
   Andlinger, said Chase Chemical is "well positioned in the
marketplace," and that Andlinger plans to "work closely with
management to help Chase capitalize upon its growth
potential."
   "We have developed a substantial drug and it seemed to be
an appropriate time to cash in," says Richard Remaly, a
partner in Chase Chemical and president and chief executive
officer of Chase Pharmaceutical Inc., which was formed by
Andlinger to acquire Chase Chemical.
   Closely held Andlinger has interests in numerous
companies, such as sunglass-maker Foster Grant Corp., with
combined sales of more than $1 billion.
   The Food and Drug Administration had given clearance to
Chase Chemical to sell nifedipine, its generic version of
Pfizer's drug. But Pfizer, which derives an estimated 15% of
its profit from Procardia, filed a patent-infringement suit
against Chase in February 1988 and delayed its introduction.
   A month after the suit was filed, Mr. Remaly participated
in a management buy-out of Chase Chemical. Organized by
Tweedy, Browne Co. L.P., New York, the management group paid
$14.5 million in cash and notes to Iroquois Brands Ltd.,
Greenwich, Conn., which took a charge of $900,000 on the
sale.
   Mr. Remaly says the company is "worth considerably more
today." He adds, "The potential for a generic Procardia is
enormous.'
   Officials for Pfizer, based in New York, couldn't be
reached for comment.
