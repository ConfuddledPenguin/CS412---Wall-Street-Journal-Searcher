   PITTSBURGH -- Equimark Corp., which has seen the top three
executives at its main banking unit depart in recent months,
said it sees higher-than-expected losses in the second
quarter.
   The expected net loss of between $12 million and $17
million reflects an ill-fated acquisition attempt in Texas,
bad commercial and real estate loans and litigation-related
expenses, Equimark said. Equimark expects that loss despite
an anticipated one-time $14.2 million gain from the sale of
its credit-card business.

   In 1989's second quarter, Equimark earned $4 million, or
33 cents a share.
   The forecast of wider losses comes amid speculation that
Equimark wants to clear its balance-sheet problems now to
attract buyers. But Equimark Chairman Alan S. Fellheimer said
there are no plans to sell the bank.
   Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said that
he had expected a loss of $6 million to $7 million and that
Equimark's consumer credit problems were worse than
anticipated.
   Mr. Fellheimer said Equimark released its earnings
forecast at the request of the New York Stock Exchange. In
composite trading Monday, the stock plunged 15.3%, closing at
$6.25. Yesterday, the share price closed at $6.50, down 12.5
cents.
   In the first quarter, Equimark had a loss of $15.4
million, compared with a profit of $5.7 million, or 50 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   In addition to a high provision for possible loan losses,
Equimark said it had losses in its unsuccessful effort to
acquire National Bancshares Corp. of San Antonio, Texas.
   Equimark also incurred costs related to litigation, but
Mr. Fellheimer declined to indicate what the litigation
entailed.
