   New Jersey officials said IDS Financial Services Inc.
agreed to pay $1.2 million to clients who invested in a
securities scheme run by a former agent.
   IDS, based in Minneapolis, is the mutual fund and
financial planning arm of American Express Co.

   The state attorney general's office said many of the
victims of the scheme were elderly, and that they will recoup
their entire investment if they accept IDS's offer.
   The attorney general's office said the agent, James Joyce,
of Trenton, and two other agents who acted as salesmen,
bilked 52 investors out of $2 million by illegally selling
them interests in J&amp;J Syndicate Inc., Trenton. It said IDS
wasn't aware of the scheme. The attorney general's office
said Mr. Joyce and one agent, Gerald L. Weiss, of Neptune,
N.J., were fired in 1986. The attorney general's office said
the third agent, Christoper DeBenedetto, Lambertville, N.J.,
was fired in February 1989.
   The state's Bureau of Securities filed suit against Mr.
Joyce in May 1989; he later fled the country and is still a
fugitive, according to the attorney general's office. A state
judge ordered him to disgorge all profits, return all funds
to investors, and levied more than $1.2 million in penalties.
State officials said the cases against Messrs. Weiss and
DeBenedetto are continuing.
   An IDS spokeswoman said, "We feel strongly that IDS was a
victim, like the clients." She called the $1.2 million
payment "an investment in our reputation." She said IDS
didn't expect to make further payments. New Jersey officials
said in their statement, however, that bilked investors are
still entitled to take their cases to court or arbitration.
