   Trading was quiet at Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis,
Tenn., according to Larry Shipman, a senior OTC trader there.
Most of the activity was confined to small investors who
traded shares of regional companies, he said. For example,
shares of Durr-Fillauer Medical, a Montgomery, Ala., maker of
medical and surgical supplies, rose 1/4 to 24 1/4.
   JSB Financial, the day's most-active stock, rose 2 3/4 to
12 3/4 on 4.5 million shares. The New York concern converted
to a stock savings bank from a mutual savings bank through a
16-million share offering priced at $10 a share.
   Laidlaw Class B shares fell 3/8 to 21 3/4 on nearly 4.5
million shares. The Canadian waste management and
transportation concern said it earned 30 cents a share in the
third quarter ended in May, compared with 25 cents a year
earlier. Chairman and chief executive officer Michael G.
Degroote announced he will resign Aug. 1 as chief executive.
   3Com, among the day's most-active stocks, rose 3/4 to 16
3/4 on 1.2 million shares. Late Tuesday, the Santa Clara,
Calif., computer-networking company reported net income for
the fourth quarter ended May 31 of 25 cents a share, down
from 28 cents a year earlier. The most recent quarter
included a one-time, relocation expense of five cents a
share. Without that expense, 3Com's quarterly earned more
than expected, data communications analyst Don Rode of
Soundview Financial Group, Stamford, Conn., said in an
interview.
   Vicor surged 2 to 15 1/4. Tuesday, the Andover, Mass.,
power supply company filed for a one-million share stock
offering. Vicor chief financial officer Thomas St. Germain
told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that a brief
profile of the company in the latest edition of Barron's and
the planned stock offering apparently contributed to interest
in the stock.
   Old Stone added 1/2 to 9 1/4. Late Tuesday, the
Providence, R.I., bank declared a regular quarterly dividend
of 39 cents a share.
   Micro Healthsystems jumped 1 5/8 to 13 3/4 after the West
Orange, N.J., health-services company said it expects to
report net income for the first quarter ending June 30 of 20
cents a share, up sharply from 12 cents a year earlier.
   Immunex surged 2 1/4 to 28 1/4. Alan D. Frazier, chief
financial officer of the Seattle biotechnology concern, told
DJPIR he was notified yesterday that on July 31 a Food and
Drug Administration advisory panel will review data on
Immunex's GMCSF drug.
   Intermetrics fell 5/8 to 1 3/4 after the Cambridge, Mass.,
computer software concern reported net income for the first
quarter ended May 31 of 14 cents a share, down from 17 cents
a year earlier.
   Sage Software tumbled 2 to 13 7/8 after the Rockville,
Md., maker of software tools reported net income for the
fourth quarter ended April 30 of 22 cents a share, up from
four cents a year earlier. One analyst had estimated the
company would earn 25 cents a share in the fourth quarter,
according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
   Western Financial slid 5/8 to 1 3/4. Late Tuesday, the
Overland Park, Kan., thrift said the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. may require its principal unit, Columbia
Savings Association, to take "material" additional write-offs
to provide for additional allowances for loan and real estate
losses.

   NASDAQ GOES INTERNATIONAL: As expected, yesterday, the
National Association of Securities Dealers asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission to approve an expanded
12-hour trading day. It would allow London dealers to trade
certain over-the-counter and exchange listed stocks on
Nasdaq, NASD's electronic trading system. The proposed system
also will allow U.S. market makers to participate in the
London trading day.
   In a filing with the SEC, NASD sought approval of its
proposed Nasdaq International Service, which it hopes to
start by mid-September. Under the system, trading will begin
on both sides of the Atlantic at 3:30 a.m. Eastern Time,
concurrent with the opening of the London Stock Exchange. At
9 a.m. Eastern time, trading over the system will halt to
allow dissemination summaries of European trading activity.
At 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, the system will reopen for trading
with the U.S. session.
   All National Market System securities are eligible for
trading on the system. Also, non-Canadian foreign securities
or American depositary receipts that are included in Nasdaq
are eligible. So are all other stocks listed and registered
on a national securities exchange, including the New York
Stock Exchange. NASD said it expects the system to handle
trading in about 400 to 500 securities.
