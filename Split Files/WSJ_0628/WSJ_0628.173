   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission ordered
British Aerospace PLC to repay #44.4 million ($77.2 million)
in illegal state subsidies granted when the company bought
the state-owned car maker Rover Group PLC in 1988.
   The decision, announced by Sir Leon Brittan, EC
competition commissioner, follows the disclosure last year by
national auditors that the British government offered British
Aerospace "sweeteners," or hidden subsidies at the time of
the sale. These were to ensure British Aerospace went ahead
with its purchase of Rover after EC competition authorities
slashed a government aid package by #331 million to #469
million.

   The ruling is expected to fuel the political controversy
in Britain over the Rover affair, which has proved an
embarrassment to the government of Margaret Thatcher. Critics
accuse the British government of misleading Parliament as
well as EC authorities in offering the hidden subsidies to
British Aerospace.
   In London, the British government didn't immediately
comment on the commission's announcement, which is to be the
subject of a statement today in the House of Commons by Trade
and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley.
   British Aerospace also said it wouldn't comment on the
commission's decision before the government's statement to
Parliament.
