   WASHINGTON -- The quiet pursuit of medical research at the
National Institutes of Health is being interrupted these days
by increasingly noisy discontent.
   Yesterday, hundreds of AIDS activists shouting "Shame,
shame" demonstrated at NIH's Bethesda, Md., campus to demand
much higher funding for research into AIDS and related
diseases.

   The protests reflect a host of fiscal and political
problems at NIH that threaten to blunt its edge as the
world's leading medical research organization. Widening
budget demands are limiting its ability to fund qualified
research projects, and below-market salaries are making it
hard to retain bright young scientists. Meantime, the Bush
administration's anti-abortion politics forced out the NIH's
director last July, and fears that politics, not science,
will shape future research priorities have made it tough to
recruit a replacement.
   "This is happening at the worst time," says Edward
Schneider, a gerontologist at the University of Southern
California. "The Japanese have targeted biomedical research
because they know that the spinoff for pharmaceuticals is
enormous," he says. "We don't have that many fields in which
we are really ahead of the Japanese and the West Europeans,"
and it would be tragic to squander that lead, Dr. Schneider
says.
   NIH pays senior research physicians about 50% less than
they could make at universities or in industry. As a result,
the NIH has 28% fewer senior researchers than a decade ago
and hasn't been able to hire a single senior researcher from
outside the government to run a lab. All of NIH's
neurosurgeons have left for higher-paying jobs, forcing the
agency to contract out operations to local medical schools.
"The NIH brain drain is a national tragedy," says Rep. Silvio
Conte, a Massachusetts Republican. "Soon NIH will mean Nobody
Is Here."
   Although NIH's annual budget has more than doubled to $7.6
billion in the past decade, much of the new money has gone
toward AIDS research, an ambitious project to map the human
genetic system and compliance with a new law to protect
animals used in research. Overall, NIH, which supports
science in universities across the country, can fund only 25%
of projects approved as justified by NIH peer review groups,
down from 40% in 1980. "A lot of good ideas are going
unfunded," says John Sherman, executive vice president of the
Association of American Medical Colleges.
   The Alliance for Aging Research, a group established to
improve the health of the elderly, says budget restraints are
preventing the National Institute on Aging from funding
promising projects that could lead to new therapies for
osteoporosis and ways to improve balance, both of which could
help reduce broken bones suffered from falls. The National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has a
list of 18 clinical trials it can't fund to study such issues
as the treatment of hypertension renal disease in blacks and
the role of diet and exercise in the treatment of noninsulin
dependent diabetes.
   The AIDS demonstrators yesterday demanded twice as much
money for NIH to pursue speedier development of new
treatments for AIDS and a broader search for treatments for
cancer and dozens of other diseases that strike people with
AIDS. But Anthony Fauci, the director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which conducts
AIDS research, warned that the demonstrations could backfire.
"I think there may ultimately be a backlash. People are
thinking that we're doing too much for AIDS relative to other
diseases. This could undermine their efforts."
   Congress and the administration are studying ways to
strengthen NIH, but the immediate challenge is to find a
prominent scientist to head the research center. Last summer
the Bush administration removed NIH Director James Wyngaarden
after seven years on the job. Dr. Wyngaarden differed with
the administration on abortion and research involving fetal
tissue transplants that could lead to treatments for such
degenerative diseases as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
   The administration has blocked federal funding of this
research out of fear that success could boost the demand for
aborted fetuses. "To ban areas of investigation for political
reasons is regrettable," says David Korn, dean of the
Stanford University Medical School. "It's an area of great
promise that essentially is obliterated from the American
repertoire." Rep. Ted Weiss, a New York Democrat who is
chairman of the House panel that oversees NIH, says the
removal of Dr. Wyngaarden contributed to a "sense that
politics rather than science drives health research."
   But the biggest problem arose last fall, when a White
House official queried candidates for the NIH job about their
views on abortion and fetal tissue research. Word immediately
circulated that the administration was imposing an
ideological litmus test, and several candidates rejected the
post. Dr. Schneider blames the administration's inability to
fill the NIH job on "the whole abortion issue."
   Even Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
concedes that the administration's handling of the initial
search "has frankly been an embarrassment." Others are
harsher. "The NIH has suffered a severe and needless setback
because of politics and ideology entering into who should be
director," complains Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who
heads the Senate Appropriations Committee panel that funds
NIH.
   Dr. Sullivan has tried to repair the damage. After talks
at the White House, he announced last fall that "standards of
scientific and administrative excellence and leadership," not
politics, would prevail in the selection process. He also
appointed an advisory committee to suggest ways to make the
NIH post more attractive.
   The panel, expected to issue its report soon, will
recommend giving the NIH director a fixed six-year term to
insulate the post from political pressure, new authority to
target funds on areas where breakthroughs appear imminent,
greater influence over policy, a reduction in red tape and a
much higher salary. Dr. Sullivan hopes the prospect of such
changes will make finding an NIH chief easier when he resumes
the search in a few weeks.
   Congress is likely to support these changes. Rep. Conte
and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have
introduced a bill to raise NIH salaries to make them more
competitive. Currently, the head of NIH makes about $100,000,
about half of what medical school department heads earn. The
bill, which has growing support in both the House and the
Senate, also would raise starting salaries for doctors at NIH
to $60,000 from $37,000. Sen. Harkin notes that at a time
when doctors leave medical school with tuition debts
averaging $42,000, many can't afford to choose research over
medical practice.
   In recent years, Congress has treated NIH generously,
generally adding several hundred million dollars to the
administration's budget request. The Bush administration
requested $7.93 billion for NIH in fiscal year 1991, which
starts Oct. 1, or $350 million more than in the current year.
But Congress seems headed toward a $750 million increase.
Still, this is less than the $1.65 billion increase that the
research community wants.
   Rep. Conte, who is the ranking minority member on the
House Appropriations Committee, faults the administration for
slighting NIH and medical research. During a recent budget
meeting at the White House, he says he told President Bush
that "you've got to do something at NIH." The response? "He
just shook his head," Rep. Conte says. "The meeting ended,
and they threw me out."

   THE NEUROSURGERY DEPARTMENT of the National Institutes of
Health continues to operate, NIH says. Based on
misinformation provided by NIH, a story in the May 22 edition
incorrectly reported that NIH no longer performs
neurosurgery.
