   Rogers Corp. said it will take a second-quarter pretax
charge of about $7 million and will post a loss for the
quarter and the full year.
   The Rogers, Conn.-based maker of electronic parts said it
is taking several steps to reduce costs and improve profit
margins, including selected divestitures and a "significant"
reduction in salaried payroll through terminations and
early-retirement offers.
