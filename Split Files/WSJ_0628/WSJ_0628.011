   MECHANICSBURG, Pa. -- When Rocco Ortenzio started the
first of his health-care ventures, analysts called the idea a
long shot at best.
   Mr. Ortenzio, a physical therapist himself, planned
free-standing units providing beds and physical therapy for
patients recovering from severe head injuries, strokes and
other debilitating or chronic illnesses. His Rehab Corp.
would charge less than hospitals.

   Health-care analysts predicted that hospitals, which
typically provide some of the same services, would become
more aggressive and take away Mr. Ortenzio's patients.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Ortenzio's initial 1969 venture not only
succeeded but also encouraged others to start similar
companies. The 56-year-old entrepreneur has since sold Rehab
Corp. and another venture and is rapidly expanding his third
venture, Continental Medical Systems Inc. here.
   Tripling its presence over last year, Continental has 882
beds in 12 locations. And most of its new locations turn
profitable within six months, Mr. Ortenzio says. Analysts
predict earnings of about $8.8 million on revenue in excess
of $225 million in the fiscal year ending Saturday.
Continental now "is one of the largest and most experienced
in the business," says Joe France, a health-care industry
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Mr. Ortenzio is succeeding in a field that is surprisingly
filled with pitfalls. With companies trying desperately to
control health-care costs, anyone with a plausible answer
might seem to have a clear shot at riches.
   But a large share of the alternative health-care ventures
-- such as home health-care providers and emergency
free-standing clinics -- that proliferated in the 1980s to
cash in on the problem of rising health-care costs, have
perished, analysts say.
   Many of the ventures "weren't able to convince physicians
that they could provide these services cheaply and as
effectively as traditional providers," says Dorothy Ryan, who
follows health-care industries for Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
in San Francisco.
   Providers of emergency medical care -- often termed
"doc-in-the-boxes" -- often failed because they couldn't
establish themselves as legitimate and longstanding providers
of health care, says Ms. Ryan. Companies that provided
home-infusion therapy, for example, competed with the very
doctors who should have been their source of patients, she
says.
   The few companies that expanded nationally suffered
excessively rapid expansion and inconsistent quality,
industry experts say. Instead of providing economies of
scale, national expansion only raised marketing costs and
aggravated management headaches, says Chicago venture
capitalist Bryan Cressey.
   Most alternative health-care providers lacked experienced
managers to control their growth, says Peter Grua, a
healthcare industry analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, investment
bankers. "They often got ahead of themselves," he adds.
   By comparison, the rehabilitation-service providers like
Continental have filled a market niche and have taken
advantage of new technology to improve therapy, Mr. Grua
notes. And because these companies have generally established
new units in outlying areas, they have managed to create a
whole new work force, he adds.
   "Insurers and third-party payers have begun to realize how
cost-effective rehabilitation therapy is," says Smith
Barney's Mr. France. "There's a ready market for these
companies because improved medical technology has led to
increased survival rates from serious injuries."
   Mr. Ortenzio has capitalized on the need -- and avoided
pitfalls. After selling his two ventures, the first to
American Sterilizer Co. in 1974, the second to National
Medical Enterprises Inc. in 1984, Mr. Ortenzio co-founded
Continental Medical Systems with several of his former
associates in 1986.
   With the $26 million or so that venture capitalists
invested, Continental initially bought a chain of nursing
homes. But it soon began to re-establish itself in the
rehabilitation-services business. With the demand for
rehabilitation services growing at 10% to 15% annually,
"there still were tremendous opportunities in the business,"
Mr. Ortenzio says.
   Continental chose to grow through acquisitions before
starting new construction. The acquisitions helped the
company generate quick revenue instead of "burning money
upfront" in lengthy construction projects, explains Mr.
Cressey, the venture capitalist whose company has backed
Continental. They also provided the firm with a core of
veteran managers who have made expansion easier, he says.
   Continental also carefully selects new expansion sites. It
has stayed away from most major urban areas to avoid
potential competition from large health-care providers and
private physician groups. The marketing costs in big cities
can also be much higher, Mr. Ortenzio says. Instead, he has
settled for new locations in cities such as North Little
Rock, Ark., and Tustin, Calif. "We are responding to needs
that are there but are being met inefficiently," Mr. Ortenzio
says.
   Once it selects a site, the company works quickly. "They
are efficient developers," says Mr. Grua, the analyst. Having
previously developed 40 to 50 rehabilitation hospitals, the
company has developed an "efficient, basic plan for building
and design with no frills," he says.
   As construction continues, Continental sends in a
marketing "SWAT" team that talks to local hospitals and
physicians about the company's services. "We try and
emphasize that we aren't competing with them," Mr. Ortenzio
says. "We are simply trying to provide a new service that
will add value to what they already do."
   The strategy clearly has worked. But Continental and other
rehabilitation-service companies aren't exempt from potential
problems, especially given the current pressure to reduce
health-care costs. "Their strength is that they are providing
a service that others haven't been able to provide as
efficiently," says Ms. Ryan of Robertson Stephens. But if
reimbursements are reduced, these companies won't be
untouched, she says.
   That doesn't alarm Mr. Ortenzio. He predicts a need for as
many as 50,000 rehabilitation beds by 1993, more than double
the current capacity of 23,000 beds. And, he adds, "as long
as we are producing quality care -- at (a cost of) as much as
20% less than at traditional hospitals -- we will be a
long-term player."
