   LOW-INCOME HOUSING finds growing favor with U.S. banks.
   "Wanting to grab the initiative from regulators, America's
major banks have moved to embrace the cause of housing for
the poor," says Craig Smith of the Corporate Philanthropy
Report. Strengthened enforcement of the Community
Reinvestment Act is one reason, but banks also like the low
lending risk created by teaming up with government and
foundation money, says Boston-based consultant James Carras.
"It complies with the federal statute, you can make money and
you look good."

   The trend is evident both in bank lending and bank
philanthropy. Chase Manhattan Bank this year adopted a policy
that local contributions committees give no less than 25% of
their money to housing or homeless programs. Bank lending
consortiums are also on the rise. The Massachusetts Housing
Investment Corporation is expected to begin formal operations
next week, with $200 million for loans and equity
investments.
   The National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders,
incorporated last year, already has 100 members and plans a
data base this fall.
                                                                                                       

   SUPERMARKET SHOPPING no longer requires going to the
store.
   Now that one-stop shopping has arrived, some supermarkets
are finding ways to eliminate the stop altogether. Vons Cos.
Inc. installed a drive-up window at its Pasadena, Calif.,
store in March, offering shoppers a chance to buy convenience
items without ever leaving the car. "A lot of elderly are
using it," says Phil Hawkins, vice president. "They just
don't like to have to walk around a supermarket." Vons is now
scouting for other drive-up locations.
   Shoppers Express Inc., Bethesda, Md., markets toll-free
ordering and local grocery-delivery service to supermarket
chains. The cost to consumers: $9.95 to $12.50 an order. The
company claims participating stores in "just about every
market in the country." Safeway Inc. says the service tested
so well that it has been expanded throughout the Washington,
D.C., area. "It's very popular among mothers with new
infants," says Safeway's Jim Roberts. Kroger Co. tests
computerized shopping and home delivery through the Prodigy
system in Atlanta.
                                                                                                       

   R&amp;D GROWTH SLOWS as more companies take a shorter-term
view.
   The top 100 spenders in research and development boosted
spending only 8.7% in 1989, compared with 10.7% in 1988, says
Inside R&amp;D newsletter. "The most research-oriented companies
had resisted the trend" seen in small and mid-size companies,
says Charles Joslin, editor. Now the slowdown "is creeping
upward." Still, the 100 stayed well ahead of U.S. firms in
general, which raised spending only 4%. One unexpected area
of growth: big industrial and farm-equipment companies
increased spending 16%.
   Economic jitters and mergers-and-acquisitions activity get
much of the blame. Companies "hold back on R&amp;D so that they
will be somewhat less attractive" targets, says Jules Duga of
Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio. He predicts that
R&amp;D spending will continue to trend downwards until 1994 or
1995, and actually may shrink before increasing again.
   Declines in defense spending may not hurt
government-sponsored R&amp;D, Duga says, noting advanced systems
and materials still must be developed.
                                                                                                       

   WEARING YOUR COLORS takes on new meaning with a line of
jackets featuring state flags. Made by Bert Newman Inc., the
jackets will sell for about $135 in department stores this
fall. The jacket most in demand so far: Texas, with its Lone
Star flag.
                                                                                                       

   LOOKING EASTWARD: Some 35% of the 1,500 largest U.S. firms
plan to do business in Eastern Europe in the next 12 months,
says the Opinion Research Corp. East Germany was named most
often, followed by the Soviet Union and Poland.
                                                                                                       

   ULCER BREATH? A new technology discovered by General
Motors Corp. and licensed to Laser Photonics Inc., Orlando,
may soon allow doctors to diagnose diseases such as ulcers,
diabetes and cirrhosis through laser-based breath analysis.
                                                                                                       

   FIREWORKS FIZZLE in some communities as costs keep rising.
   Some towns are taking the bang out of their Fourth of
July. Ridgewood, N.J., did away with its traditional display
this year, blaming a court ruling that moonlighting cops can
be denied disability pay if injured working crowd control.
"We can't hire any off-duty policemen for crowd control,"
says Sue Michaud, deputy village clerk. Nearby Paramus tried
to revive its display -- which died four years ago from suits
and rising prices -- but ran into the same problem. In
Massachusetts, Fire Marshall Joseph O'Keefe says there were
50 fireworks displays around the state a few years ago, but
he's been advised of only 35 this year.
   Other towns say they're not cutting back despite increased
costs. Naperville, Ill., says its Fourth will be as "big as
ever." Boston adds a "magnesium electric storm with silver
rain" to its Charles River display. Marblehead, Mass., which
canceled last year for lack of funds, raised $20,000 in
private donations to fund this year's event.
   Rockford, Ill., says some events have been scaled back,
but only because the holiday falls in midweek.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The latest summer gadgetry: personal air
conditioners such as Bionaire's Cold Front that can be used
without venting. . . . Just as President Bush changes his
line on taxes, Pressman Toy Corp. launches a new party game
called "Read My Lips."
