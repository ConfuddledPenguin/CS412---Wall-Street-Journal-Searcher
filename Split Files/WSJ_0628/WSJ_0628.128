   GENERAL DEVELOPMENT Corp. (Miami) -- Thomas J. Hutchison,
48 years old, was named president, chief operating officer
and a member of the board of this real estate development
company, which in April filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Mr. Hutchison,
who has been working as special assistant to the company's
chairman and chief executive officer, Charles Simons, for the
past eight weeks, assumes the post of president from Mr.
Simons. The company didn't have a chief operating officer.
His addition to the board increases its size to 11 directors
from 10.
