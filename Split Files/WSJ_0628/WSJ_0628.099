   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. is telling bankers that it
hopes to reset the interest rate on $2.6 billion of its most
troublesome high-yield junk bonds at 16 1/2%, perhaps as soon
as this summer.
   The estimate -- which still has to win investment bankers'
approval -- shows how much the tobacco and food company
believes its giant refinancing plan should improve its
creditworthiness. A month ago, bond-market specialists
estimated that RJR would have to accept a rate of 20% or
higher, if those bonds' interest rate could be successfully
reset at all.

   As previously reported, RJR has begun a $5.3 billion
effort to reshape its balance sheet. RJR and its major
shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., plan to inject
new bank loans, preferred stock and equity into the company,
while retiring potentially high-cost junk bonds. News of
RJR's plan has sent its junk bonds soaring nearly 20% the
past month, to about 82 cents on the dollar.
   Bankers say RJR aims to retire all of its $2.18 billion of
14.07% convertible reset bonds due 2009 and $1.95 billion, or
about 45%, of its 14.07% reset bonds due 2007. Those reset
bonds have threatened to create a financial crisis for RJR,
because their interest rates must be reset by next April so
that the bonds trade at full face value. The bonds have
traded as low as 58 cents on the dollar this year, suggesting
that RJR could be forced to pay a ruinously high interest
rate to meet its reset obligations.
   Even after its refinancing plan, RJR plans to leave about
$2.6 billion of its reset bonds of 2007 outstanding, bankers
say. Those are the bonds that RJR hopes to reset at a 16.5%
interest rate, the bankers add.
   Some bondholders are optimistic about RJR's chances of
success. "The reset is starting to look more doable," says
Lawrence Garshofsky, an arbitrager at Kayne Anderson &amp; Co.,
Los Angeles, which owns some RJR bonds. "If they can complete
it, that bodes well for RJR's financial health."
   But an executive at a major bank lender to RJR cautions
that the 16.5% reset rate is just a "ballpark figure" that
could change. For one thing, he says, a major change in U.S.
interest rates would disrupt RJR's calculations. So would any
difficulties in putting the refinancing package together, or
a downturn in RJR's basic businesses.
   Furthermore, the exact reset rate won't be determined by
RJR. The company's investment bankers, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., are scheduled to confer with two
independent Wall Street firms, Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and Dillon
Read &amp; Co., to set the reset rate. If they can't agree, a
fifth Wall Street firm will pick a rate between the ones they
decide on.
   Dillon Read vows it won't be pushed around by giant RJR
and KKR. "Our job is to set the rate on the debentures," said
Fritz Hobbs, an investment banker at Dillon Read. Those
duties are "pretty clearly defined. And I don't know yet
what's going to happen."
