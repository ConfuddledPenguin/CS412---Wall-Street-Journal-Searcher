   WASHINGTON -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee
approved by voice vote a bill that would give the Securities
and Exchange Commission the power to impose fines for a
variety of securities-law violations.
   The SEC's authority to levy fines currently is limited to
insider-trading cases. For other violations, such as
short-selling offenses or fraudulent sales practices, the
agency must choose between an injunction or barring the
offender from the securities industry altogether.

   In addition to giving the SEC the power to impose fines,
the bill would allow the commission to impose
cease-and-desist orders against securities-law violators.
"This injunctive remedy would mean the SEC would no longer be
required to go to court to secure a temporary restraining
order or permanent injunction," said Rep. Matthew Rinaldo
(R., N.J.).
   The bill also would permit the SEC to ask courts to
prohibit people convicted of a securities-law violation from
serving on the board of a public company. Moreover, the bill
would let the SEC impose on violators fines of up to $100,000
for individuals and $500,000 for firms, or the amount of
their profits, whichever is greater. The bill is identical in
most respects to a measure passed by the Senate Banking
Committee.
   The committee also passed by voice vote legislation aimed
at curbing fraud and abuse in the penny-stock market. The
bill would, among other things, substantially increase
disclosure requirements for some penny-stock issues and
expand SEC power to bar crooked penny-stock salespeople from
the securities industry.
