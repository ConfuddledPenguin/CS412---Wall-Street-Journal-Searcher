   YORK -- Alleghany Corp. shareholders defeated a proposal
to extend one of the financial-services company's defenses
against hostile takeovers.
   The plan, which was part of the company's articles of
incorporation, allowed any holder of more than 15% of
Alleghany to cast only 0.10 vote for each share over 15% and
to cast no more than 20% of the voting power, no matter how
big the holder's stake.

   Chairman F.M. Kirby, favored the plan; his brother, Allan
P. Kirby, a director, led the fight against it.
   Holders of 2,885,128 shares voted against the plan,
2,527,674 shares voted in favor and 279,947 shares abstained.
Holders of 88% of Alleghany's shares outstanding voted. A
majority of the roughly 6,400,000 shares outstanding was
needed to extend the plan.
   F.M. Kirby said the shareholder vote "speaks for itself."
Allan Kirby said the tally was a "clear rejection of the
proposal" and reflected "reasonably broad agreement among
shareholders" about his position on the matter.
   Allan Kirby had argued that keeping the restriction could
limit the company's market value and insulate directors and
senior management from "accountability to all stockholders."
Alleghany's managers sought to extend the plan to help them
"deal with an active takeover environment in general and with
its possible disruptive consequences."
