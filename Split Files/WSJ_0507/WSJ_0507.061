   WALTHAM, Mass. -- Thermo Electron Corp. said it agreed to
acquire E.M. Lamort S.A., a closely held, French maker of
equipment for recycling paper.
   Thermo declined to disclose terms.

<TEXT>
   The agreement is subject to approval by regulators in
France and the U.S. and by Thermo's directors.
   Under the agreement, Lamort, which had sales of more than
$35 million last year, would become part of Thermo's Web
Systems subsidiary, which makes equipment for the paper
industry. The two already have some joint-venture activities.
   Thermo Electron makes cogeneration systems,
industrial-process equipment, analytical instruments and
biomedical products.
