   It's something new for the California League of Women
Voters to be branded a puppet of the Republican Party, but
that's exactly what opponents of an initiative to curb the
political abuse of gerrymandering are calling the 70-year old
voter-education group. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the
most powerful Democrat in California, went so far as to tell
a League audience last month that the group should "stay in
the kitchen where it belongs."
   Mr. Brown's press secretary denies the Speaker used those
exact words, but admits he implied the League "should stay in
the kitchen because they have the luxury of sort of taking on
issues as a hobby." The Speaker's Chief of Staff recently
canceled a meeting on legislative ethics with the League's
lobbyist because the group has become "too partisan."

   League members see it differently. They say California
voters are being denied a free choice at the ballot box by
carefully gerrymandered districts that make it impossible for
an incumbent to lose. In the 580 state and federal races in
California since the 1981 gerrymander, only nine incumbents
have been defeated.
   The League says it is backing Proposition 119 on the June
7 ballot because its members are demanding reform. Prop 119
would take the drawing of district lines away from
self-interested state legislators and give it to an
independent commission selected by three retired judges.
   The late U.S. Rep. Phil Burton's 1981 redistricting plan
virtually ended competitive elections for Congress. Some GOP
House Members went along with his plan because it also left
them with safe seats for life. An example of the Burton
handiwork in California is shown nearby.
   Voters rejected the Burton gerrymander at the ballot box,
but the Legislature merely changed a few details and -- with
the help of the partisan Rose Bird State Supreme Court --
cemented the lines back into place. Polls indicate voters are
determined never again to have the value of their vote so
diluted. The latest Field Poll shows the initiative leading
by 52% to 20%.
   Incumbents, fearing the storming of their political
castles, are fighting back. California's Democratic
congressmen asked unions to give $1 million in so-called
"soft money" to fight Prop 119, but abandoned the idea after
inquiries by the Journal's Jill Abramson and Jeffrey
Birnbaum. There is also evidence that Democrats have been
pressuring corporations not to support redistricting reform.
   Although Prop 119 leads in the polls, its supporters are
bracing for a tidal wave of TV ads seeking to discredit it.
They recall that in 1984 a similar reform effort was narrowly
defeated on the strength of an ad campaign that Speaker Brown
later boasted amounted to a "con job" on voters.
   If Prop 119 loses, the real con job will be done by
California legislators when they redraw district lines next
year. New computer technology and census data will allow them
to calibrate carefully how districts should be gerrymandered
down to the block level. As Phil Burton once noted, the best
election for incumbents is one where the outcome has been
determined in advance.

   In our April 30 editorial on California gerrymandering
("Gerrymandered to the Kitchen"), we stated that Proposition
119, which takes the power to redraw districts away from the
legislature, was leading in the polls by 52% to 20%. Those
numbers actually referred to Proposition 118, a second
initiative to limit gerrymandering. Proposition 119 also has
led in the polls, but by 35% to 32%.
