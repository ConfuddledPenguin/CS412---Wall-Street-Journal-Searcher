   Interco Inc. said its banks agreed to extend to Oct. 1
certain loan payments that were due today, including a $225.9
million payment on its bridge loan.
   Interco, which is suffering from a heavy debt and interest
burden, said the loan waiver extension will allow time to
complete an amendment to its existing bank credit agreement.

   The maker of furniture and shoes also said its board will
consider "additional restructuring proposals" at a meeting
Wednesday. It didn't elaborate.
   Interco borrowed heavily in late 1988 to pay special
dividends to shareholders and fend off a takeover threat.
Asset sales have been less successful than expected.
