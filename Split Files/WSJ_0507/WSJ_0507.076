   In our April 30 editorial on California gerrymandering
("Gerrymandered to the Kitchen"), we stated that Proposition
119, which takes the power to redraw districts away from the
legislature, was leading in the polls by 52% to 20%. Those
numbers actually referred to Proposition 118, a second
initiative to limit gerrymandering. Proposition 119 also has
led in the polls, but by 35% to 32%.
