   One of the most popular investment strategies of the past
decade is rapidly turning into one of this year's biggest
disappointments.
   Investing in foreign bonds produced glittering results,
easily surpassing returns on U.S. bonds, during much of the
1980s. Many investors reacted by sending part of their
savings overseas, buying foreign bonds directly or purchasing
shares of international bond mutual funds.

   But investors who waited until this year to jump on the
international "bondwagon" are finding that it can be a very
treacherous ride. Results have been especially dismal for
investors holding Japanese, Canadian, British, Australian and
West German bonds, according to statistics compiled by J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., a unit of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
   Japanese government bonds have produced by far the biggest
losses for U.S. investors. Since the start of 1990, the
Japanese securities have plunged almost 14%, when measured on
a total-return basis (including price changes as well as
interest income) in U.S. dollars.
   Fears of inflation, political uncertainty and surging
interest rates have produced "one of the worst sell-offs in
global bond markets since the early 1980s," said Nicholas
Sargen, a director of bond market research at Salomon
Brothers Inc. The strength of the dollar in world currency
markets has compounded the problems for U.S. investors in
many foreign bonds.
   Now, many advisers say U.S. investors should stay home, at
least for the next few months. "I would recommend buying
Treasurys right now," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman
of Goldman Sachs International, a unit of Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co.
   "I think the U.S. bond market is going to be a better
investment {than most major foreign bonds} over the medium
term, because inflation has topped out and because the dollar
is likely to remain robust" against most major foreign
currencies.
   Treasury securities prices surged Friday, reducing yields
available to investors. But yields on Treasury notes and
bonds -- at around 8.75% -- remain very attractive
historically. The long-term average annual return on
far-riskier stock-market investments, for instance, is about
10%. And the interest-income from government-guaranteed
Treasurys is free from all state and local income taxes.
   As a result, individual investors are expected to buy
unusually large amounts of Treasury notes and bonds this week
at the government's "quarterly refunding." The government
will be selling $30.5 billion of notes and bonds to pay its
bills and redeem previously issued notes and bonds coming
due. The three-part auctions begin tomorrow, with the sale of
three-year notes.
   But while Treasurys look especially attractive, investors
shouldn't abandon foreign bonds completely, money managers
say. Foreign securities provide a way for U.S. investors to
broaden the diversification of their portfolios, which can
reduce an investor's overall risk. Even though many foreign
bonds have produced abysmal results in recent months, several
others have glittered.
   Over the past 12 months, Spanish, Italian, French and
Belgian bonds each produced total returns (in U.S. dollars)
of more than 16%, according to J.P. Morgan's government bond
index. That was far above the performance of U.S. bonds,
which produced a total return of 8.32% in that period, said
Victor Filatov, a vice president at Morgan Securities.
   "There is a place for international diversification, both
in bonds and equities," said A. Michael Lipper, president of
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. He warned, however, that
investors must be aware that their returns will be affected
heavily by foreign-currency fluctuations.
   Despite this year's bond-market problems, some global
mutual funds have managed to produce strong results. From
Aug. 20, 1987, through last Thursday, figures compiled by
Lipper show, Putnam Global Government Income chalked up a
total return of nearly 41%. PaineWebber Master Global was
close behind, with a total return of more than 38%.
   Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs recommends that investors
keep a small portion, perhaps 5%, of their money in foreign
bonds as part of a diversified portfolio. "When you invest in
a country's bonds, you are betting on the effectiveness of
that country's central bank in controlling inflation," Mr.
Hormats said. And right now, the best bet is here at home.
   He also warned against assuming that the foreign stars of
the past 12 months will continue to shine. "The past isn't
necessarily prologue," he said.
   Italian and Spanish bonds, the top performers in the past
12 months, are unlikely to be as strong in coming months
because of domestic spending concerns and inflation pressures
there, Mr. Hormats said. But he is more bullish on French
bonds. "France now looks good," he said. "Inflation looks
stable, and the general outlook is quite good."
   For investors already holding foreign bonds, sitting tight
could be the best strategy right now, if Mr. Sargen of
Salomon Brothers is right. He contends that the global-bond
"nightmare may be winding down."
   Global bond markets are likely to "recoup some of their
losses" through the rest of this year, as "fears of inflation
subside in most countries," he wrote in a report issued late
Friday. He said, rallies last week in the U.S. and overseas
bond markets "provided the first ray of sunshine this year."
   Don't expect huge rallies, though, Mr. Sargen warned.
"First, the political uncertainties that have contributed to
the bond-market setbacks -- especially in West Germany, the
United Kingdom and Canada -- won't disappear quickly." At the
same time, net capital outflows from Japan "increasingly will
be rechanneled to European markets and away from the U.S. and
Canada," he wrote. Thus, he concluded, yields in most bond
markets "should finish 1990 at levels still considerably
above those at the beginning of the year."
