   NEW YORK -- April's weak jobs report has taken the wind
out of many economists' sails as well as some of the worry
out of this week's inflation report.
   The April producer price index, due out Friday, is
expected to rise again after two calm months. But concerns
about inflation are being tempered somewhat by last Friday's
employment data, which showed a drop in overall employment
and another significant slump in factory jobs. The figures
immediately prompted economists to begin cooling their
projections for next week's April industrial production and
personal income as the consensus shifted to a lower economic
gear. This week's indicators include March consumer credit
and business inventories plus April retail sales data.

   "The {jobs} data clearly had a significant impact," said
Charles Lieberman, managing director of financial-markets
research at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., New York.
Before the report, Mr. Lieberman thought that the economy was
improving at a rate that would stoke inflation. "Now, growth
may be moderate enough that I see no upward pressure on
inflation," he said. However, conditions "aren't sufficiently
moderate" to prompt the Federal Reserve Board to stimulate
the economy through lower interest rates.
   Richard S. Peterson, chief economist at Continental Bank
in Chicago, reluctantly lowered his outlook on April
industrial production to a decline of about 0.2%. He
previously expected a gain of that amount. "And it looks like
personal income won't be so strong either," he added.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Peterson believes that the economy may
yet rebound. For one thing, he thinks employment data is
still being skewed by unseasonal weather. And he believes
some of the lost jobs represent an attempt by manufacturers
to trim labor costs by controlling work-force size through
attrition and other means. "I'm going to look for a
turnaround," he said.
   In the meantime, the consensus calls for at best a flat
reading on April industrial production, according to a survey
taken after the jobs report by MMS International, a unit of
McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.
   The consensus view on April producer prices calls for an
increase of 0.2%, following March's 0.2% drop and February's
flat reading. Several economists noted that much of the
increase is due to a return of higher gasoline prices
following what's turning out to be a surprisingly brief
respite. Next week's data on the consumer price index is
expected to show an increase of 0.3%, according to the MMS
survey.
   A Federal Reserve Board spokeswoman said the consumer
credit data would be released Thursday, rather than today.
The Fed, unlike the Commerce and Labor departments, doesn't
always follow expected release dates. March consumer credit
is once again likely to be dominated by slower auto sales.
The consensus calls for an increase of $3 billion, following
growth of $3.4 billion in February.
   April retail sales, due out Friday, are expected to
rebound following March's 0.6% decline. Easter sales helped
the general retailers in the month, although not as much as
they had hoped. The consensus view calls for a gain of 0.3%.
   The March business inventories report, due out today, is
expected to fall a bit. Stephen S. Roach, economist at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., noted that the continued liquidation of
factory stocks should be only partly offset by a resumption
of modest stockpiling at the retail level. Mr. Roach, who
expects a 0.2% drop in inventories, added in his weekly
newsletter that "business remains intent on tight inventory
control."
   POSITIVE SWING: For the first time since January of 1989,
Sindlinger Co.'s monthly tally of positive household
liquidity found that the number of states in its "recession"
column decreased. The Wallingford, Pa., pollster interviews
households around the country about their personal finances
and job prospects. States with fewer than 50% of residents
giving "positive" answers fall into the recession category.
In April, the recession states fell to 35 from 41 in March.
Improvement centered on the Midwest and Northwest.
