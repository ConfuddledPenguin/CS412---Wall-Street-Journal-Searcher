   Petro-Canada Inc. said it is offering for sale 10 packages
of Canadian oil and gas properties, representing about 9% of
its oil and gas liquids output and 4% of its natural gas
production.
   The state-owned integrated oil and gas concern, which is
preparing to be privatized, said the sale is part of a plan
to rationalize assets. It didn't disclose a value for the
properties.

   The assets last year generated net operating revenue of
about 38.5 million Canadian dollars (US$32.6 million), on
average gross daily production of 8,900 barrels of oil or gas
liquids and 24 million cubic feet of natural gas.
   Waterous Securities Inc., Calgary, Alberta, has been
retained as Petro-Canada's financial adviser and agent for
the offering, which will take place in two phases, the first
of which is scheduled for this month, the company said.
