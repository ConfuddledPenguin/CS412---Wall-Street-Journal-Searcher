   DALLAS -- In a major coup for NCNB Texas National Bank,
International Business Machines Corp. chose the NCNB Corp.
unit to finance construction of a $150 million office complex
in Austin, Texas.
   NCNB Texas beat out a large banking concern and two
Japanese banks to make the loan, according to Ralph Carestio,
an NCNB corporate executive vice president.

   The bank, which has been dogged by its image as a
tight-fisted outsider since it entered the Texas market in
August 1988, touted the IBM deal as its largest real-estate
loan to date and "an excellent example of Texans helping
Texans."
   But the loan appears nearly risk-free. IBM will be the
sole tenant of the 1.1 million square feet of office space to
be built in a joint venture with Prentiss Properties, a
Dallas-based real-estate developer. The seven-building
complex, which will be owned by the joint-venture partners,
will house about 3,400 of IBM's Austin-based employees
beginning in spring 1991.
   "The lease term is long enough that we've got ample
debt-service coverage for a long, long time," Mr. Carestio
said. "It's as good as a real-estate loan gets."
   Neither Mr. Carestio nor an IBM spokesman would specify
the length of IBM's lease or other details of the financing.
   But Mr. Carestio said the loan "is not uncharacteristic of
what's going to be happening" in real-estate lending in
Texas. "You're going to see more of these kinds of things,"
with tenants financing their own buildings in so-called
"build-to-suit" developments, he said.
   Similar office projects are planned in the Dallas area by
J.C. Penney Co. and GTE Corp.
   Even with known tenants, however, developers aren't
finding eager lenders, said Mike Prentiss, president of
Prentiss Properties. (The development company scored a coup
of its own with the IBM deal, beating out Trammell Crow Co.
to become IBM's partner.)
   "Notwithstanding who the tenant may be, {lenders} are very
reluctant to finance office buildings in Texas," Mr. Prentiss
said.
