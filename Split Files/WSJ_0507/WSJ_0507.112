   Raychem Corp., Menlo Park, Calif., said it agreed to sell
an undeveloped 57.3-acre industrial site in Silicon Valley to
Sun Microsystems Inc. for $39 million. The transaction is
expected is be completed next year.
   Sun Microsystems, of Mountain View, Calif., makes computer
workstations. Raychem, which recently reported a
third-quarter loss of $108 million, previously announced it
would sell its land in Silicon Valley and acquire
manufacturing sites in other, less-expensive parts of the
U.S. The company, a maker of aerospace, automotive,
electronics and telecommunications products, said a
larger-than-expected drop in its defense business was partly
responsible for its most recent loss.
