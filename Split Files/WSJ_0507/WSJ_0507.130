   TORONTO -- General Motors of Canada Ltd. said its joint
venture with Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan will double production
of its subcompact passenger cars with the start of a second
work shift in September. GM Canada is a unit of General
Motors Corp.
   The joint venture, CAMI Automotive Inc., with one plant in
Ingersoll, Ontario, currently makes 60,000 subcompacts and
40,000 sport utility vehicles a year. A CAMI spokesman said
subcompact production will rise to 120,000; and the number of
CAMI employees will increase about 300, to 1,700 by November,
when the added shift is expected to reach full production.

   The subcompacts are currently marketed by GM as the Geo
Metro in the U.S., and as the Chevrolet Sprint and Pontiac
Firefly in Canada. The Suzuki version is marketed as the
Swift in the U.S. and Canada.
   The CAMI spokesman said the increased production is needed
to meet demand for the subcompacts, particularly in Canada.
