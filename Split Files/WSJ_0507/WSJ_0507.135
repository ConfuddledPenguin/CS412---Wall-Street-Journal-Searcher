   PHILADELPHIA -- Hunt Manufacturing Co. said it completed
its acquisition of the Graphic Arts Group of Bunzl PLC for
#22 million ($36.1 million) plus a single contingent cash
payment.
   Hunt, a maker of office and art supplies, said the
contingent payment is for up to #4.75 million, based on the
next three years of cumulative net sales of the acquired
businesses and certain related products.
