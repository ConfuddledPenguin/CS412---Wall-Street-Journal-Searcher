   LOS ANGELES -- Zero Corp. expects to report net income
totaling about $16,144,000, or $1.02 a share, for the year
ended March 31, little changed from $16,063,000, or $1.02 a
share, in fiscal 1989, Wilford D. Godbold Jr., president and
chief executive officer, said.
   Mr. Godbold's disclosure of unaudited fiscal-year results
indicates that fourth-quarter net totaled $4 million, or 25
cents a share, squarely in the middle of analysts' estimates
and a 14% decline from the $4.7 million, or 30 cents a share,
of a year earlier.

   Zero Corp. makes aluminum and plastic storage boxes and
enclosures for a wide range of computers, instruments and
other delicate objects, as well as cargo containers for
aircraft.
   Sales for the latest fiscal year totaled about $197
million, a 15% boost from $170.9 million in fiscal 1989, Mr.
Godbold said in an interview. Details of other revenue
weren't available for the latest year. In the earlier year,
interest and other revenue of $2.5 million brought total
revenue to about $173.5 million.
   The latest fiscal-year profit is a record -- by a whisker.
Sales also are a record. Zero Corp. has posted record profit
and sales in 17 of the past 18 years, its chief executive
said.
   Mr. Godbold said he expects another year of record profit
and sales in fiscal 1991, ending March 31, but declined to be
more specific.
   After a number of boom years, Zero Corp.'s profit climb
has slowed substantially with a downturn in military and
computer business. Mr. Godbold said Zero Corp. has
systematically reduced military sales to about 19% of its
total in the latest fiscal year from 37% in 1982. The
company's carrying cases and enclosures for the military
generally accompany high-technology electronic equipment -- a
part of military procurement that Mr. Godbold argues will be
sustained.
   As to the computer-related business, which accounted for
about 21% of revenue in the latest fiscal year, Mr. Godbold
said sales slid starting last September but seem to have
flattened out beginning in February. Zero makes a wide
variety of enclosures and cooling systems for computers and
computer peripherals.
   Mr. Godbold said the unaudited net income in the latest
fiscal quarter, ended March 31, includes an undisclosed
amount of one-time costs for closure of a Florida production
facility and transfer of that plant's output to an existing
facility in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts plant, in turn,
is expected to become more profitable in coming quarters, he
said.
   Regarding the Air Cargo Equipment Corp. unit, acquired in
1988 for about $21.3 million, Mr. Godbold said it is
operating profitably, has shown strong sales growth and is
expected to operate in a sharply growing market through the
decade. Air Cargo Equipment makes cargo containers for
aircraft, a business that accounts for about 17% of Zero
Corp.'s sales.
   The Air Cargo Equipment unit also makes a line of ground
support equipment for aircraft that is apparently less
successful, despite repricing of some of its products. Mr.
Godbold said the line's performance will be watched closely,
suggesting that it may be sold if it doesn't meet
expectations.
   As for further acquisitions, Mr. Godbold said Zero Corp.
continues to look for two types of investments: smaller
operations with annual sales in the $8 million-to-$15 million
range, whose products would fold into Zero's existing lines,
or larger, stand-alone operations with a niche business and
sales in the $25 million-to-$100 million range that could
operate as separate units, as does Air Cargo Equipment.
   Mr. Godbold said the company is "very busily looking at
potential acquisition candidates," adding that Zero is
interested, among other things, in expanding foreign
operations either through investment in new facilities or
through acquisition. Foreign business currently accounts for
only about 10% of sales.
   The executive said that Zero Corp.'s cash and short-term
investments total about $13 million currently and that
long-term debt totals about $4 million.
