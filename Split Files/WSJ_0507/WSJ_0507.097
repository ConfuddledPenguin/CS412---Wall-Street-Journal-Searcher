   NEW YORK -- The dollar is likely to resist being dragged
sharply lower by the sudden downturn in U.S. interest rates,
currency specialists say.
   Aggressive dollar selling isn't expected in the near term
despite April's surprisingly weak U.S. employment data, which
stifled predictions of near-term tightening by the Federal
Reserve and halted the ascent of Treasury bond yields.

   That's primarily because there are still a lot of
unanswered questions about the path of interest rates in West
Germany and Japan and the impact of the planned German
monetary union that may keep investors from fleeing the "safe
haven" offered by U.S. currency, dollar watchers say.
   "Near term, I think the dollar can hold its own," says
Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc.,
Chicago. The dollar, he adds, appears "fairly priced" at
current levels.
   At the close of dealings here Friday, the dollar traded at
1.6662 marks and 158.25 yen, compared with 1.6827 and 158.05
here late Thursday. Despite the defeat of Britain's ruling
Conservatives in Thursday's local elections, the pound
finished at $1.6630, having strengthened from $1.6410.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
158 yen.
   The dollar dropped against most foreign currencies just
after Friday's release of last month's U.S. employment data.
The report was eagerly awaited because of speculation that
the Fed was on the verge of tightening credit because of
signs of unexpected economic strength and rising inflation
pressures. Higher interest rates generally tend to bolster a
currency.
   But instead of vigor and higher inflation, the statistics
showed across-the-board employment weakness and hinted at
lessening price pressures.
   Non-farm payrolls, a closely watched indicator of the
economy's health, rose 69,000 after increasing 103,000 in
March. Some economists had forecast an increase of more than
350,000, expecting a hefty rise because of the hiring of
temporary census workers.
   The jobless rate rose to 5.4% of the work force from 5.2%
in March, and the number of manufacturing workers dropped
22,000. Average hourly earnings rose only three cents despite
a minimum wage increase that went into effect April 1,
stemming some of the concern about inflation.
   The report "throws the argument for Fed tightening out the
window," says Earl Johnson, a foreign-exchange adviser at
Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago.
   Rather than increasing interest rates, the Fed will
probably sit tight and leave official interest rates where
they are, analysts say. The Federal Funds rate, which is the
rate on reserves traded among commercial banks overnight and
the Fed's main policy tool, has hovered around 8.25% since
last fall.
   "The economy is not going to run away at this point," so
the Fed doesn't have to act, says Diego Giurleo, senior
manager of treasury services at the Royal Bank of Canada.
While tightening is unlikely in the near term, persistent
inflation concerns will prevent the Fed from letting rates
edge lower, he says.
   Besides causing an alteration in predictions about the
Federal Reserve's actions, the April employment report shook
things up in the Treasury bond market.
   The yield on the bellwether 30-year bond tumbled Friday,
ending the week at 8.82% after rising to 9.03% earlier in the
week and hitting the highest level in nearly a year. The
yield had soared recently because of rampant inflation
concerns and worries about demand for the record $30.5
billion of new issues that will be auctioned by the Treasury
in its quarterly refunding this week.
   Some analysts had expected the bellwether yield would head
toward 9.25% soon if the market's thrashing continued, but it
is now believed the yield will stay under 9% if the auction
draws solid demand and the mood in the market remains
positive.
   Despite the thwarting of predictions for near-term Fed
tightening and the possibility of a further decline in
Treasury bond yields, analysts say the dollar probably won't
fall far below current levels anytime soon because of
continued capital flow into the U.S.
   "The dollar is still relatively attractive, interest
rate-wise. It's not a big sell," says Mr. Giurleo. In West
Germany, the benchmark government bond currently yields about
8.51%, while Japan's benchmark bond has a yield of
approximately 7.42%.
   Until the direction of interest rates in West Germany and
Japan is clearer, there probably won't be any big dollar
moves, analysts say. It is believed that both the Bundesbank
and the Bank of Japan may have to raise rates later this year
if inflation rises in West Germany and Japan.
   Among other market concerns are the rapid move toward
German monetary union and the future of Japan's financial
markets after the rout earlier this year.
   "There's too much uncertainty now" to dump the dollar,
says Mr. Johnson of Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank. He sees the
dollar testing support at 1.65 marks and 156 yen in the short
run, but not likely sliding under those levels.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $370.90 an ounce, down 50 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $371.75 an
ounce.
