   The next landmark litigation could be the Central Park
Jogger Case. This is the young woman who while running
through New York's park was attacked by a band of young
thugs, beaten savagely, raped and left for dead. She
survived, and her alleged attackers are soon to go on trial.
Her attack is the kind of incident that makes people worry
about the levels of violent crime today, but the case also
points up the many ways that defendants now try to exclude
evidence against them. We've argued that this use of the
exclusionary rule makes it difficult to reduce violent crime.
   One defendant in the jogger case has said that his
confession should be suppressed because a lawyer wasn't
present, as juvenile rules require, because the defendant had
a fake ID saying he was 16. Another says his grandmother
didn't understand the Miranda warning even in Spanish, and
another was "coerced" by "the promise to go home." The judge
has rejected these claims, but the defendants will appeal.

   Protectors of the exclusionary rule insist that it's no
problem. They say that hardly anyone gets off because of it.
This misses the point. The real issue is not how many cases
are brought and lost, but how many cases are never prosecuted
in the first place.
   Prosecutors are not fools. They often don't bring brutal
cases when they know they will lose because a judge will
order that key evidence be suppressed. The defendant walks,
often laughing. Hiding evidence of guilt from jurors is a
major barrier to fighting crime.
   Studies have found that when prosecutors decide not to
bring felony drug cases, 30% of the time it's because of
search-and-seizure problems. No one knows how many cases are
plea bargained because of an exclusionary-rule problem. If
there is to be a war on drugs, the rules of engagement need
changing.
   This common-sense view is challenged by defenders of this
uniquely American concoction who claim no correlation exists
between suppressing evidence of crimes and failure to convict
criminals. This group includes criminal-defense lawyers,
police bureaucrats and the American Bar Association.
   To clear the air, we offer a primer on the various
exclusionary rules, starting in 1961. In the intervening
years, the murder rate has doubled, rape has quadrupled and
robbery has quintupled.
   -- 1961, Mapp v. Ohio: This applied a rarely used federal
exclusionary rule to state courts, where 99% of crimes are
litigated. Juries can't see relevant evidence if there is a
Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure problem, such as a faulty
warrant.
   -- 1964, Massiah v. U.S.: Said a jury can't know the
incriminating statements freely made by an accused cocaine
smuggler to an accomplice who was secretly cooperating with
the police. Problem: The defendant's lawyer was not present.
   -- 1965, Griffin v. California: Said a jury can't draw any
conclusion from a defendant's failure to defend himself or
hear that a defendant has a history of similar crimes because
such evidence might cause "prejudice."
   -- 1966, Miranda v. Arizona: Said a jury can't hear a
murderer's voluntary confession if the police failed to ask
his permission before asking him any questions or omitted the
specific words of a warning that the confession could later
be used in court.
   Federal judges may have thought this harsh remedy was
justified in the 1960s when the police, especially perhaps in
the South during desegregation, were guilty of routine
misbehavior. But the judicial experiment of suppressing the
truth has turned out to be disastrous overreaching. Nothing
in the Constitution requires suppressing evidence under any
of these circumstances. Justice Cardozo's famous complaint is
still valid: There's no reason for a criminal to go free only
"because the constable has blundered."
   Before the 1960s, the Supreme Court was generally guided
by its holding that Fourth Amendment search violations are
"no good reason for excluding the papers seized as evidence
if they were pertinent." England follows a better rule. It
allows the evidence, but also disciplines police misbehavior
with lawsuits, fines, pay cuts and removal from the force.
The exclusionary rule creates no such disincentives for
misbehavior by U.S. police. Legal scholar Dallin Oakes has
noted, "Only a system with limitless patience with
irrationality could tolerate the fact that where there has
been one wrong, the defendant's, he will be punished, but
where there have been two wrongs, the defendants's and the
officer's, both will go free."
   Criminal trials are not supposed to be games with arcane
rules. Trials are meant to achieve justice by finding the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. With the
truth known, the guilty are punished and only the innocent go
free. The exclusionary rules invented since the 1960s have
ensured that too often the people responsible for violent
crime don't come close to the system that is supposed to
establish guilt, innocence, justice or the truth.
