   Legend tells of the traveler who went into a country store
and found the shelves lined with bags of salt.
   "That's a lot of salt," said the traveler to the
storekeeper.

   "You think that's salt," said the storekeeper, and led his
visitor to the cellar, which was stacked high with bags of
salt.
   "You must sell a lot of salt," said the traveler.
   "Nah," said the storekeeper. "I can't sell no salt at all.
But the feller who sells me salt -- boy, can he sell salt."
   What brings this story to mind is the sight of tens of
billions of dollars in mortgage securities stacked in the
cellars after the S&amp;L collapse.
   They come in great variety. Some represent ownership of a
whole horse, packages of real mortgages such as an ordinary
investor's Ginnie Mae pass-through. Many others are
"derivative" securities, "strips" or "tranches" of mortgage
packages, reporting claims on just the interest payments,
just the early repayments of principal, just the late
repayments of principal, just whatever's left after all the
other tranches get paid, etc. Owen Carney, deputy national
bank examiner for the New York area, told a conference the
other day that the first "collateralized mortgage obligation"
he saw -- in the early 1980s -- had four "tranches," while
the most recent one he's looked at had 47. A lot of those 47
are the rear part of the horse.
   Thrifts supplied the necessary fodder to the investment
banks that created these securities by selling them the
mortgages from which the derivatives were made. And they were
big buyers of what came out the other end. The salesmen from
those same investment banks told them they were getting a
sure thing -- safe, risk-adjusted high returns.
   The Resolution Trust Corporation, as receiver for dead
S&amp;Ls, has come into possession of tons of this stuff, and a
lot of mortgages, too. So the investment banks are busy
colonizing the RTC, which likes the idea that it can get more
for its mortgages by paying fees to people who package them
than it would get simply by selling the paper.
   The RTC is under pressure to sell, because Congress and
investors in government securities are getting restless about
what promiscuous RTC borrowing for "working capital" will do
to the credit markets. And the live S&amp;Ls have become net
sellers, too, because the easiest way to improve their ratios
of capital to assets is to sell assets.
   So who's buying? Why, the commercial banks, of course.
They're stocking up. At the nation's banking trade shows
these days, presentations on the assured risk-adjusted
profitability of mortgage-backed securities have become the
most glamorous entertainments on the schedule. Every once in
a while, somebody asks a nasty question, like, "if this stuff
is so liquid, why do you make it so costly for me to do a
repurchase with you?" But mostly the show goes over well.
   At the end of 1986, commercial banks held a total of $37
billion in mortgage-backed securities. By September 1989,
they held $120 billion, and counting. The numbers clearly are
beginning to worry the Comptroller of the Currency. Last week
Wall Street buzzed with rumors, which were not denied, that
the comptroller has plans to forbid banks to buy some of the
most cleverly carved cuts of the mortgage-sellers' horses.
   From a bank's point of view, a mortgage security has three
great virtues. As a practical, day-to-day matter, it's an
easy place to put money in a time of poor loan demand. In
Texas, for example, NCNB, Banc One and Texas Commerce have
been scrapping for deposits but have no local use for them,
so they buy a lot of mortgage securities. From December 1988
to September 1989, NCNB went from $300 million to $6.9
billion in holdings of such securities.
   Then, for purposes of the Basel accords, which set minimum
capital standards for banks world-wide, these securities are
government-insured mortgages, which means they have a "risk
weighting" of only 20%. To keep faith with Basel, a bank must
put $30,000 of stockholder money into each million-dollar
commercial loan. To carry a million-dollar mortgage security,
however, the bank needs only $6,000 of equity.
   Finally, mortgage securities yield more than treasuries,
and the closer the tranches get to the rear of the horse, the
greater the yield. With securities representing strips of
adjustable-rate mortgages, a bank can claim almost any yield
it likes, because auditors and examiners will not enter the
analytic nightmare of calculating the real accretion of value
in such instruments.
   The bank examiners have no proclaimed standards for a
capital cushion to be kept against interest-rate risk. It's
understood that a modern bank will hedge such risks, and the
same gentlemen who sell the banks the securities will also
sell them hedges -- at a spread maybe four-times what the
bank would have to pay to buy a combination of Treasuries and
exchange-traded futures and options. After all, as the
salesmen point out, it's a customized service: You're getting
exactly the tranches you need, and you can be confident of
that because we tell you so.
   In theory, the tranches nearer the tail lose their
preferential weighting on the Basel scale, but first the
examiner has to find them, and then he has to withstand the
argument that, hell, we've hedged the risk. "Hedging" is a
term of art in bank examination. It means not that some
economic substance has been protected, but that there is a
"Memorandum to File" stating that a hedge has been purchased
and meets some artificial statistical condition.
   All mortgage paper has mysterious options embedded in it,
because homeowners can pay off their loans at any time for
any reason. Pricing these options is a highly technical
skill, and banks (let alone bank regulators) are not likely
to pay as much for such skills as the people in the
investment banks who design and sell such instruments.
"Regulators who let naive banks buy mortgage securities,"
says Sri Sankaran of SRI Inc., a Chicago based
options-analysis company, "are like the Red Cross sending
hospitals blood donations from drug addicts; they're
spreading a fatal disease."
   Most businesses that leverage their equity 150 to 1, which
is what the Basel rules permit for holdings of these
securities, live on the edge of a cliff. But banking
regulators make things look all right by permitting banks to
claim the house still stands even if the sea eats away its
foundations. Banks can continue to carry securities in their
investment portfolio at whatever was paid for them, even if
the market price goes down. Concealment of losses, approved
by the regulators, was what made the S&amp;L disaster
unmanageable.
   There are two ways to keep this slippery slope from
plunging the taxpayer into a commercial bank bailout. The
first is a requirement that everything in a bank's portfolio
for which there is a market be marked to the market price
every night. The second is that additional (not reduced)
capital be required from every bank that wants to buy strips
or lesser tranches of mortgage-backed securities. These
procedures are roughly what the Shadow Financial Regulatory
Committee has recommended.
   Purchases of the tail ends from the manufacture of
mortgage securities -- what the Salomon Brothers salesmen,
according to Michael Lewis in "Liar's Poker," called "toxic
waste" -- produced billions of dollars of losses at the S&amp;Ls.
The comptroller is right to be worried at the sight of so
much of this stuff moving from the S&amp;Ls to the banks. If he
doesn't move soon -- and carry the Fed and the FDIC with him
-- the legislative draftsmen had better get started writing
the Commercial Bank Bailout Bill of 1995.
