   Rhone-Poulenc S.A. said it completed a $78-a-share tender
offer for about 50% of Rorer Group.
   The announcement came on the heels of a change in Rorer's
bylaws, approved by about 98% of voted shares, that exempts
Rorer from certain anti-takeover provisions in Pennsylvania
law.

<TEXT>
   Holders in Rorer, a Fort Washington, Pa.-based
pharmaceutical concern, must vote again at a meeting still to
be scheduled whether to approve the second part of the merger
between the company and the drug business of Rhone-Poulenc, a
chemicals company based in Paris. Under that part, holders
will receive stock and other securities in the combined
company, to be 68%-owned by Rhone-Poulenc.
   Rorer has estimated the total value of the transaction at
$3.15 billion.
