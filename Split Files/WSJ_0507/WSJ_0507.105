   The California Legislature is moving toward adopting a
plan that would tie state sales taxes on new cars to the
amount of air pollution they cause. Similar measures are
being considered in Massachusetts and Iowa.
   The bills borrow a tactic from the auto industry, which
has long used rebates to move slow-selling cars. The states'
measures propose to use sales tax rebates to spur the sale of
low-polluting vehicles.

   As currently written, the California bill would remove the
average $700 state sales tax on a low-polluting,
medium-priced car. Consumers who choose a similarly priced
model with a high pollution rating, however, would pay the
$700 in sales taxes, plus a surcharge of as much as $74.
   The theory is that such a price spread would give auto
makers an incentive to make cleaner cars while providing
consumers with incentives to buy them. "If we are serious
about cleaner air, we have to send the right price signals to
manufacturers and car buyers," says the bill's sponsor, Sen.
Gary K. Hart, a Santa Barbara Democrat. Autos are considered
the major source of California's air pollution problems.
   Sen. Hart's bill, known as Drive +, cleared an important
hurdle late last week when it was favorably reported from the
state Senate's Revenue and Taxation Committee. However, aides
to the senator and a coalition of environmental groups
supporting the measure concede that it's likely to face
stiffening opposition from industry during hearings before
the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Already, General Motors Corp. has signaled it's unhappy
with certain provisions, including one that lumps
air-emission standards for trucks with those for cars. "They
aren't built to meet the same standards," says Lee Ridgeway,
a GM lobbyist who has followed the bill.
   Proponents believe, however, that some version of Sen.
Hart's bill will inevitably become law in California, where
voters in the past four years have given overwhelming support
to a variety of environmental initiatives regulating
everything from toxic chemicals to offshore oil drilling.
   On the ballot this November is the most ambitious of these
initiatives to date. Known as "Big Green," it would mandate a
sweeping array of controls on pesticides, air pollution and
forestry practices, among others. Although some industry
segments have vowed an intense campaign to derail the
measure, most also concede that the initiative will likely
pass.
   "If we get Big Green, we will pass Drive +," says Carl
Pope, a Sierra Club spokesman who predicts a steamroller
effect for environmental legislation in general should Big
Green win.
   Under Sen. Hart's bill, all new cars would have to meet
current state and federal emission standards. Essentially,
the bill rewards those that exceed those standards. It
mandates the state's Air Resources Board to test all new car
models and to establish a rebate benchmark, based upon the
average emission levels of those models that do better than
the state and federal guidelines.
   The models that meet or exceed that benchmark qualify for
rebates, while those that fall short would be burdened with
sales taxes, and in some cases, surcharges. Under the law,
dealers would be required to post the results of emission
tests, and any rebates or surcharges, on a car's sticker
price to aid consumers in comparison shopping.
