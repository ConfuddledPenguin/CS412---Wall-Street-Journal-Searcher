   MOSCOW -- A number of small Western businesses that
haven't been paid by Soviet foreign trade organizations for
many months are suffering serious financial hardship and some
have filed claims with their export insurers.
   Diplomats and bankers attempting to negotiate settlements
with the Soviets say the problem of payment delays, which
began last year, doesn't seem to be improving. Large sums
have been paid following delays in some instances, but then
new delays occur in others. Several Soviet trading firms have
also asked to reschedule their payments until as late as
1993, leading to speculation that the problem may drag on and
that the organizations still don't have enough money to meet
all their obligations.

   "It's a very patchy situation," says Don Brown, commercial
counselor to the British Embassy. "They seem to be making
payments to some at the expense of others."
   At least two British traders are suffering severe hardship
now, says Mr. Brown. Another European economic counselor who
doesn't want his country identified says one company he
represents is also near collapse. And a group of minor West
German concerns that together are owed several hundred
million West German marks have applied to Hermes, the
government's export insurance administrator, for
compensation. A spokesman for Hermes in Hamburg says requests
for compensation have "jumped dramatically" in recent months
and now amounts to a "three-digit figure, in the millions."
   It was also reported last week that several of Japan's
major trading houses, including C. Itoh &amp; Co., Mitsui &amp; Co.,
Mitsubishi Corp. and Nissho Iwai Co., have taken the first
steps to claim export insurance because their Soviet trading
partners had delayed payments.
   The British firms haven't yet filed any claims, but have
made numerous inquiries about how they would recoup losses,
says a spokesman for the Export Credit Guarantee Department.
The spokesman adds that he hopes that embarassment will drive
the Soviets to pay the bills before an avalanche of claims
comes in. Meanwhile, the department is offering advice on how
payments might be negotiated.
   While initially one main trading organization for
chemicals called Soyuzkhimexport was blamed for late
payments, the delays now seem to have spread to many other
industries, including steel, machinery and technology. The
total amount owed has been estimated at at least $500
million.
   Soviet officials blame the delays on chaos resulting from
a decentralization of the foreign trade system. While Soviet
exports and imports used to be a simple and reliable
transaction handled through several government-run trade
organizations, more than 12,000 enterprises now trade
directly with the West. Many of them aren't balancing their
books properly and have depleted the system of currency, the
officials say.
   "I guess they have no money," says Boris O. Kozhevnikov,
director of the law and treaty department at the USSR Chamber
of Commerce and Industry.
   Large delegations of European government officials have
come to Moscow in recent months to negotiate payments and
avoid depleting their export insurance reserves. Later this
month, West German ministers plan to take up the problem at
the Commission for Economic Cooperation, according to
Wolfgang von Lingelsheim-Seibicke, a counselor at the West
German embassy.
   While bigger companies like the chemical concerns Du Pont
Co. and Hoechst AG have been annoyed by the delays and in
some cases have stopped shipping goods until the payments are
made, they haven't felt the effects as severely as smaller
trading firms that have a majority of their business tied up
with the Soviet Union, the diplomats say. Those smaller firms
must pay their suppliers and the lack of payments from the
Soviet side has hurt them badly.
   The officials have declined to identify the companies,
while the companies themselves, saying they feared angering
their Soviet partners, refuse to comment. By discussing the
situation, the companies would risk losing not only payments,
but future business, the officials say.
