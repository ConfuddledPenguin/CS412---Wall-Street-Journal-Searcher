   DENVER -- Manville Corp. reorganized some of its
operations and named two new group presidents as part of a
continuing effort to define its core businesses and better
focus its marketing efforts.
   The maker of wood, paper and fiberglass products named
Richard A. Kashnow president of the new Engineered Products
Group, which will make and market the company's fiberglass
mats, reinforcement fibers, and auto and aerospace filters
and insulation parts. Manville's Glaswerk Schuller unit in
West Germany will also be part of the group. Mr. Kashnow was
vice president and general manager of the former mats, fiber
and reinforcements division at Manville.

presidents of the corporation.
   John D.C. Roach, an executive vice president, was named
