   DALLAS -- Battered by huge strike-related losses,
debt-burdened Greyhound Lines Inc. launched a last ditch
drive to avoid seeking protection from its creditors under
the federal bankruptcy code.
   Last week, the struggling unit of GLI Holding Co.
initiated a series of meetings with lenders, creditors and
suppliers aimed at restructuring credit agreements and
extending payments on both its publicly held debt and bills
owed to suppliers. The company also laid off 170, or about
5%, of its headquarters and administrative employees.

   The actions came as the company disclosed in a Securities
and Exchange Commission filing that it posted a staggering
$55.8 million loss on revenue of $172.5 million during the
first quarter ended March 31. For the same period a year ago,
Greyhound had a loss of $14.4 million on revenue of $223.5
million.
   Because of the losses, the company said it didn't make
nearly $5 million in lease payments on buses and properties
due April 30. The company faces similar lease payments of
varying amounts every month. Greyhound also said it wouldn't
make a $9.8 million May 15 interest payment on its 13% senior
notes due in 1995. That prompted Moody's Investors Service
Inc. to downgrade its rating on those bonds to Caa from
single-B-3 on Friday.
   Meanwhile, the company's deteriorating financial situation
has apparently dimmed the chances for an early end to the
two-month-long walkout by 9,400 members of the Amalgamated
Transit Union.
   Union negotiators came away from a federally mediated
weekend bargaining session in Washington, D.C., furious about
new company contract proposals which they claimed would
result in substantial pay cuts for drivers. "They're worse
than the ones we had before," said Edward Strait, president
of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, the
ATU's bargaining unit. "We're going backwards." Prior to the
strike, Greyhound proposed a three-year package of
incentive-based pay raises that included a 6.9% pay boost in
1990.
   Mr. Strait said the company is seeking a six-year contract
with no pay increases during the first four years and 3% pay
boosts in each of the last two years. He said a company
proposal to end mileage-based pay and put all drivers on a
$12.79 an hour wage would effectively cut many drivers' pay
by roughly $125 a week.
   Greyhound officials with knowledge of the talks couldn't
be reached for comment.
   In the SEC filing, Greyhound blamed its mounting financial
woes on the often violent strike. The company said it had
spent more than $20 million on security, legal fees and new
driver training since the strike began March 2. Don Seaquist,
vice president and treasurer, said that was about three times
what the company expected to spend.
   The company said that since the walkout began, 46
Greyhound buses and terminals have been hit by gunfire, more
than 100 bomb threats have been made and company facilities
and personnel have been the targets of hundreds of incidents
of assault, vandalism and arson.
   Greyhound said it has spent $8.3 million beefing up
security and pursued injunctions in more than 20 state courts
at a cost of $4.4 million in legal fees. In addition, Mr.
Seaquist said, violence has meant that far fewer union
drivers cross the picket lines than anticipated, forcing
Greyhound to find and train more replacement drivers while
initially being unable to operate at expected levels.
   While declining to estimate additional losses the company
expects to report in April, May and possibly June, Mr.
Seaquist said, "the major costs associated with the strike
are behind us."
   With the busy summer travel season fast approaching,
Greyhound said it is operating 87% of its route system and
achieving 68%-70% of pre-strike revenue.
   In an effort to boost ridership and revenue, last week the
company launched a nationwide advertising campaign, slashed
fares on certain routes and began offering an unrestricted
"go anywhere" $99 roundtrip fare.
   But with Greyhound saddled with more than $340 million in
long-term debt from its 1987 leveraged buy-out, some industry
analysts questioned whether the company can avoid a
bankruptcy filing.
   "It's not inevitable but it's certainly a very clear
possibility," said Philip Baggaley, analyst and senior vice
president with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. In addition to driving
customers away, he said the company's financial announcements
last week could make it more difficult to obtain fuel, spare
parts and other necessary items from suppliers.
