   WASHINGTON -- Former Navy acquisition official George
Stone pleaded guilty to conspiracy and another charge
stemming from the nationwide investigation of Pentagon
bribery and influence-peddling.
   Mr. Stone, who supervised Marine Corps contracts as a
mid-level civilian official through the late 1980s, was
indicted on broader charges two months ago for helping
subsidiaries of Litton Industries Inc. and United
Technologies Corp. obtain bid-related information. The two
companies haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, but two
defense-industry consultants and three former executives of
United Technologies' Norden Systems subsidiary have been
convicted of conspiring to attempt to illegally secure some
$150 million of Marine Corps business.

   Mr. Stone initially fought the charges against him. But
Friday in Alexandria, Va., federal district court, he agreed
to cooperate with the continuing grand jury inquiry and
pleaded guilty to two felony counts. He could face a total of
15 years in jail and a $500,000 fine.
   In documents filed with the guilty plea, prosecutors for
the first time provided details about how Mr. Stone
personally intervened to keep Norden in the competition for a
Marine Corps radar-and-communications contract in 1988.
