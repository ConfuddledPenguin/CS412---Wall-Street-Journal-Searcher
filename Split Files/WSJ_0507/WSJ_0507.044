   WASHINGTON -- General Dynamics Corp. agreed to pay
$527,000 in back pay and salary increases to minority and
women workers as part of a settlement of government job
discrimination charges.
   The Labor Department's contract-compliance office said the
defense contractor's Space Systems division in San Diego
didn't fully carry out its affirmative-action program. The
office identified several practices it alleged to be
discriminatory.

   General Dynamics agreed to the settlement without
admitting the charges.
   The Space Systems division agreed to extend job
opportunities to black engineering applicants allegedly
screened out of positions, and to give $268,771 in back pay
to 21 black individuals, the compliance office said. The
contractor also reviewed the salaries that it pays to
minorities and women, and raised the pay by $258,590 for 42
minority men and women and 61 non-minority women.
