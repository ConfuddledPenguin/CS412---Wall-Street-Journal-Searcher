   NEW YORK -- Bowne &amp; Co. said it reached a definitive
agreement to purchase certain assets of Sorg Inc. for $6
million, including the Sorg name and trademark and printing
equipment.
   Sorg, a New York-based financial printer, has been
operating with protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code since August. The agreement is
subject to approval of the bankruptcy court.

   Bowne, another financial printer, said it will employ a
dozen members of Sorg's New York management and sales staff.
The company said press equipment included in the purchase
will give Bowne extra capacity to handle work in process from
Sorg's New York facility, and it will allow Bowne to retire
some of its older equipment. The agreement doesn't include
Sorg's real estate, Chicago office and various other assets.
