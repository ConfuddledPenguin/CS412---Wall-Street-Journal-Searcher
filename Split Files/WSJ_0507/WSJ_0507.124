   Valhi Inc. said first-quarter net income declined 42%, in
part because of the expenses its NL Industries Inc.
subsidiary incurred in fighting a proxy battle with Lockheed
Corp.
   Valhi, the holding company controlled by Dallas investor
Harold C. Simmons, posted net of $14.1 million, or 12 cents a
share, down from $24.3 million, or 21 cents a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 results included a $6.2 million pretax gain
from the sale of assets.

   The company, which owns 66% of NL, a Houston specialty
chemical company, said results were hurt by $11 million in
expenses related to its unsuccessful effort to unseat
Lockheed's board, as well as by increased interest expenses
from NL's 1989 Deutsche mark financing. Part of that
financing was used to purchase shares in Lockheed.
