   EDENBRIDGE, England -- On a balmy spring day, Ken Eastwood
takes off his city shoes, pulls on plastic "bog trotters" and
rambles down a footpath in Kent.
   Stalks of green wheat and budding bluebells blanket the
fields. Robins chirp in the hedgerows, lambs gambol through
the flowers. The air is ripe with blossoms, new-mown grass --
and a steaming heap of horse manure.

   Mr. Eastwood stares at the dung, "mucked out" from a
nearby stable and deposited in his path. "Farmer
malpractice," he says with a frown. "Our way is completely
obstructed."
   In America, if man meets manure on a stranger's farm, it
is the man who doesn't belong. Not so in England. Here,
ancient footpaths crisscross the countryside, providing
public right of way through plowed fields and past farmhouse
windows. It is the landowner's job to keep the routes clear
and the job of men like Mr. Eastwood, a "footpath secretary"
with the Ramblers' Association, to expose foul play by
farmers.
   These days, he is busy. In a barnyard-to-barnyard battle,
farmers are plowing under paths and posting "no access" signs
on their pastures. The ramblers are fighting back,
prosecuting landowners and demanding the right to roam as
they wish -- on or off footpaths -- across all uncultivated
land.
   "It's war out here on the moors," says Benny Rothman, a
78-year-old rambler, clutching a tuft of heather on a
precipice of the so-called Dark Peak in north-central
England. Catching his breath, Mr. Rothman mimicks the bleat
of a passing sheep and answers the shout of a grouse. "Man is
descended from animals that wandered at will," he says.
"Private property can't change that."
   In 1932, Mr. Rothman, then a "city lad from the slums of
Manchester," as he puts it, made this same steep climb during
a "mass trespass" to protest the closing of the moor by
graziers and gamekeepers. He spent four months in prison, and
outrage over the case helped open moors and establish clear
legal status for rights of passage across Britain.
   Now, Mr. Rothman says, the fight must be renewed because
"farmers are stealing back the land." A recent government
survey showed that crops, bulls, barbed wire and other
obstacles encroach upon two-thirds of England's 108,000 miles
of footpath. "Greed, that's all it is," says the impish,
5-foot-tall Mr. Rothman. "A farmer will skin a louse if he
can get hold of one."
   Farmers say they would rather skin Mr. Rothman and other
militant ramblers. "They're muck-stirrers, anarchists," says
David Mellor, who raises livestock at the base of the Dark
Peak, so named because of the black, gritty stone beneath the
purplish heather. "They spend their money in the pub while we
save it to buy land. They've no right to moan."
   Another Midlands landowner, Stuart Elliott, illustrates
the conflict with a sunset stroll across his 160-acre
Farfield Farm. Five public paths cut across his land, at one
point forming a giant X across a small field defined by
ancient stone walls. "People think, `Oh well, it's just
grass,'" he says as, two-by-two, the evening ramblers walk
across fields he sows for animal feed. "That's my life
they're treading on."
   Mr. Elliott says that a rambler's unleashed dog once
killed one of his lambs and that dogs worry his sheep,
causing pregnant ewes to abort. Gates also are left open,
allowing stock to stray. And week-enders often lose their way
while trying to follow vague guidebooks. "On a Sunday,
they'll be wandering around like the children of Israel," Mr.
Elliott says.
   Mr. Elliott's wife, Gil, regrets the loss of privacy. One
footpath cuts right past the front door of their 300-year-old
stone farmhouse. "Ramblers always stop to stare in our
windows," she says, sitting by a wood fire. "They think we're
quaint."
   Most farmers accept footpaths as part of the landscape,
since they once were used as routes to markets, churches and
pubs. The paths historically were one of many common
privileges, including the rights to gather acorns for pigs
and peat for fires. These days, cars bring millions of city
dwellers to the country on weekends, and landowners say
public access should be "rationalized," with some paths
closed or diverted, particularly during lambing and at
harvest time.
   But ramblers resist any suggestion of a rollback.
"Compromise is the road to ruin," says Don Lee, hiking
through the Midlands village of Hayfield. Coming upon a sign
that says "Private: No Throughroad," Mr. Lee checks his
survey map. Sure enough, the driveway doubles as a public
right of way. Mr. Lee tries to knock the sign down, then
settles for turning it around. "Give a landowner one inch and
he'll turf you right off the land."
   Skirmishing is most fierce in lonely, windswept tracts
with names like Bleaklow, Far Moss and Nether Moor. This
wild, Wuthering Heights landscape is the scene each autumn of
grouse "drives," in which beaters herd ground birds into the
air to be shot. Hunters pay landowners up to $600 a day for
use of terrain that is otherwise of limited value.
   "If you're about to shoot at a pack of 500 birds, and a
rambler in a brightly colored coat pops up out of nowhere,
the whole sport is distorted," says Martin Gillibrand,
secretary of the Moorland Association, a lobbying group for
grouse-moor owners.
   Responds the Ramblers' Mr. Rothman: "Very sporty it is,
drinking whiskey and massacring birds. I'm told the grouse
love it." Grouse-moor owners want to limit rambling during
the nesting and shooting of birds. Ramblers, meanwhile, want
free access to moors where no paths exist, and they are
lobbying the House of Commons to toughen laws to keep
footpaths clear.
   Social tension magnifies the upland conflict. Many moor
ramblers come from grim industrial cities. Myra Gregory, a
retired teacher from Manchester, says she lives "in a row of
houses all stuck together with music going bumpety bump in
the night and cars rumbling past." Sprawled in heather atop
Dark Peak, she adds: "If I couldn't come out here and feel
the wind on my face, I'd go crazy."
   Many moor owners, on the other hand, are wealthy and
titled and hold vast estates. "It's the politics of envy,"
says Peter Geldart, an official of the Country Landowners
Association. "It pits those who have against those who think
they ought to have."
   Nationwide, though, most foot soldiers of the rambling
movement aren't havenots, nor are they anarchists. Mr.
Eastwood, the footpath secretary in Kent, is a 59-year-old
Tory who, until six months ago, put on a suit each day and
went to work as manager of Lloyds Bank's biggest branch, in
central London. These days, he dons a windbreaker, waterproof
pants and bog trotters to patrol green fields for rural
wrongdoing. "I didn't want to spend my retirement in a golf
cart," says the tall, lean rambler.
   At one field, he pauses to inspect a broken "kissing
gate," a sort of turnstile that lets people through but not
animals. Later, he admires a barley field where a farmer has
recut a path through the shin-high stalks. "Very
presentable," he says. "If everyone did a proper job, I could
retire." Hewing closely to the narrow path, he avoids
trampling the crop and calls to his sole companion, "Single
file]"
   Mr. Eastwood works as a volunteer, firing off letters to
county officials responsible for maintaining footpath signs
and enforcing the laws. One hiker recently won $100 when a
farmer's dog tore his pants. Another man is being prosecuted
for harassing hikers. Mr. Eastwood now is battling to
maintain rights of way through the dozens of golf courses
being built across Kent.
   At ramble's end, over a pint of beer and a ploughman's
lunch, Mr. Eastwood tells how he met his wife during a group
ramble through Wales. Almost every vacation they have taken
since then has been a walking holiday in rural England or
abroad. "In Italy, the locals thought we were mad," he
recalls, "walking in the midday sun."
   Usually, he sticks to the gentle countryside close to
home, with its half-timbered farmhouses, green fields and
areas marked "forest," though the trees were felled centuries
ago. "Some people pine for the Himalayas," he says, putting
back on his city shoes. "Me, I'll take Kent."
