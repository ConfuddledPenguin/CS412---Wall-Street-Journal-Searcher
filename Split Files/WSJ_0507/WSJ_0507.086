   BALTIMORE -- The only problem with target-marketing to
blacks is that there isn't enough of it, concluded
participants at a national conference of black marketing
executives.
   Some 150 professionals from major consumer companies,
black media and black ad and promotion firms, grappled with
the issue in Baltimore at the annual meeting of the National
Association of Market Developers, a 36-year-old black
professional organization. In discussing the $253 billion
black market, the participants tried to reconcile their own
economic interests as marketers and their desire to serve the
interests of the African-American community.

   Both goals would be served, most say, if more companies
aimed a greater range of products specifically to blacks and
used black advertising, marketing and promotion professionals
to do it.
   "The question is not if it's okay to target. The question
is: Why isn't Bristol-Myers, and all the other companies who
market products blacks overconsume . . . into {targeting the
black} market?" says Larry Glover, director of corporate
marketing for Essence magazine. Mr. Glover says such
magazines as Essence do not get enough other ads to lessen
dependence on liquor and cigarette spots. Advertisers in many
product categories, including high-end fragrances, luxury
cars and ethical drugs, "still don't put much money with us,"
he adds.
   A case in point is consumer-products and tobacco giant RJR
Nabisco Inc., which was attacked earlier this year when
community protests scuttled plans for the first cigarette --
Uptown -- overtly targeted to blacks. According to Ken
Smikle, editor of Target Market News, a new trade
publication, such companies as RJR should advertise a wider
range of products on the billboards in the black community.
Tobacco and liquor billboards, which have been painted over
by protesters in cities across the nation, would not be as
much of a problem if there were more competition for the
spaces. "The {cigarette} ads are not being pushed out by the
Nabisco part of RJR," Mr. Smikle says.
   Mr. Smikle sees the lingering heat from the Uptown and
billboard controversies as an opportunity for the
black-marketing cause. Last week he appeared on the "Today
Show" to make the case, as did Essence editor Susan Taylor
the next day on the "CBS Morning News." And also last week,
after some months of quiet pushing by Mr. Smikle, a group
including the largest black-owned ad agencies, magazines and
broadcast outlets agreed to form a new trade association to
act as expert advocates for the black market.
   "Target marketing is not a constitutional issue or a
freedom of choice issue or a form of racism," Mr. Smikle told
the participants in a session subtitled, "What Went Wrong
With Uptown."
   "Target marketing is directly tied to the survival of
black media," he said. "Target marketing is why many of us in
here have a job."
   Indeed, the fear of losing hard-won gains in their
marketing careers underscored the urgency of taking the
offensive for black targeting. Companies that have only
gingerly embraced target marketing, the professionals say,
may see the controversy "as an excuse to back off," says
Renee Simons, director of special projects for a unit of
Phillip Morris Cos.
   As for "Uptown" itself, the black executives maintained
that if RJR had used the input of black professionals,
particularly a black advertising agency, the fiasco would not
have happened. Many say they were questioned by nervous top
brass when news of the Uptown controversy hit. Charles
Morrison, vice president for black and Hispanic marketing
with Coca-Cola Co., says he was more than ready with the
answers.
   "When they said what are the implications, I said there
are none -- because we'd never do anything this foolish," Mr.
Morrison says. Most marketers said that RJR blundered because
the company declared its intention to target a product to
blacks that is considered to be a health hazzard. A
spokeswoman for RJR in Winston-Salem, N.C., conceded as much,
saying, "If a mistake was made, it was with our honesty."
   The spokeswoman said the company's advertising agency in
the aborted Uptown campaign, Leber Katz Partners, did in fact
use the services of a black consultant, whom the company
would not identify. She said a black advertising firm was not
retained because Leber Katz had done a good job with programs
aimed at black smokers. Mr. Smikle notes that despite a
disproportionately high rate of smoking among blacks,
virtually none of the $2.5 billion spent on tobacco
advertising and promotion last year was placed with a
black-owned firm.
   One solution to the problem of selling harmful products
versus maintaining careers was offered by Benjamin Hooks,
executive director of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Hooks drove home the point
that blacks can use all the advertising and public relations
money that flows from marketers and still make their own
decisions about harmful products like cigarettes or
extravagances like sneakers. Mr. Hooks then interrupted his
speech to accept a check for $50,000 from a charity of Reebok
International Ltd. for the general fund of the civil-rights
group.
   "And that is my commercial for the day," Mr. Hooks said,
returning to his speech.
