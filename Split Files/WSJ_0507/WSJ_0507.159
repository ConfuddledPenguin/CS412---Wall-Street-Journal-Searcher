   WASHINGTON -- The latest unemployment numbers suggest
there is still widespread weakness in the American economy.
   Private-sector employment declined in April, pushing the
nation's civilian unemployment rate to 5.4% of the work force
from 5.2% in March, the Labor Department said.

   Overall, employers outside the farm sector added only
69,000 new workers to their payrolls, the department found in
a survey of businesses and other employers. Excluding the
government's hiring of 79,000 temporary census workers,
payrolls actually shrank.
   The unemployment numbers jolted a number of economists who
had been pointing to a string of recent statistics they
thought might be suggesting an upturn, following a brush with
recession at the end of last year.
   "One would have to conclude that the underlying economic
situation was weak," said Paul McCracken, an economist at the
University of Michigan who was chairman of the White House
Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon administration. "My
own view is that for a variety of reasons too much got made
here recently of a few scattered bits of evidence that the
economy was taking off again."
   Recent data have shown pickups in factory orders and
industrial production. Auto companies have successfully
trimmed inventories and rehired laid-off workers. Consumer
spending has held its own. And just over a week ago the
Commerce Department said the economy, aided by unseasonably
warm weather, grew at a 2.1% annual rate in the first
quarter, nearly twice the pace of the fourth quarter.
   But the new employment numbers -- the first government
economic reading for the month of April -- hardly sketch a
healthy economy, many analysts said.
   Manufacturing employment fell, as it has in 12 of the past
13 months. Construction employment fell. Real estate
employment fell. Employment in retail trade, transportation
and public utilities was flat.
   The average weekly hours of manufacturing workers fell.
Overtime hours fell. Hours for all private workers showed no
change.
   "I was one of those people who was concerned last fall and
turned off the panic button in the past few months. What this
tells me is we may have passed bottom but we're certainly not
growing very fast," said Peter Radford, chief economist at
National Westminster Bancorp, in New York.
   Of course, a single month's numbers don't provide any
conclusive evidence about the economy. "If the small job
gains in April continued at that slower rate we would be
concerned. But we don't make a lot out of any one month's
numbers," said Michael Boskin, chairman of the White House
Council of Economic Advisers.
   The change in payrolls is one of the government's most
closely watched economic statistics, and economists consider
it a more precise indicator of economic strength than the
unemployment rate, which is derived from a survey of
households.
   The department did make a steep upward revision to its
calculation of job growth in March. After reviewing
additional data, department analysts said payrolls increased
by 103,000 workers during the month, instead of the faint
26,000 gain the department originally reported last month.
   But even with the revision, the payroll gain was
considered mild. For the first four months of 1990, the
average monthly growth in non-farm payrolls was 175,000,
compared with a 200,000 monthly average for all of 1989 and
275,000 for 1990.
   Janet Norwood, the federal commissioner of labor
statistics, told Congress that it will take another month or
two of data to understand more clearly what's going on in the
nation's labor markets. But she said, "What does seem clear
is that the goods-producing sector has seen reduced
employment during the past year and job increases in many of
the service-sector industries have slowed recently."
   Mrs. Norwood suggested that strong employment growth in
January and February, influenced by unusually warm weather,
may have made hiring in March and April look particularly
weak.
   For example, she said a 99,000 drop last month in
construction jobs, after seasonal adjustment, followed very
large gains in February and January "because of unusually
mild weather which made it possible to sustain construction
activity that would have normally been curtailed. Therefore,
relatively few new hires occurred in March and April."
   But the weakness in the report led many analysts to
predict that the Federal Reserve will refrain from pushing up
interest rates for now. Recent statistics showing increased
inflation coupled with hints that the economy could be
picking up strength have led some analysts to conclude that
the central bank had little choice but to tighten credit to
squeeze out price pressures in the economy.
   The employment report also offered some sign that
inflation pressures could be abating. Average hourly earnings
grew only three cents during the month, to $9.95, despite a
50-cent increase in the minimum wage, to $3.85. Weekly
earnings grew by $2.38 to $343.97, a gain of 0.3%. Over the
past year, average hourly earnings have risen 3.6% while
average weekly earnings have grown 2.7%, the report said.
Economists viewed those increases as mild and not the kind of
cost pressure that leads businesses to raise the prices.
   "I'd think the Fed would be very encouraged by the wage
number," said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings
Institution here.
   April was the first time the unemployment rate has hit
5.4% since January 1989. The rate is still low by the
standards of the past couple of decades, however. Since
mid-1988, the rate has bounced between 5% and 5.5%, the
lowest range since the early 1970s.
   The slight rise in the jobless rate last month meant that
people looking for work but unable to find it grew to 6.8
million during the month from 6.5 million in March.
   Mrs. Norwood told Congress, however, that "thus far we can
discern no meaningful change in the measures that might
signal a deteriorating unemployment situation. In particular,
neither the number of newly unemployed -- those jobless less
than five weeks -- nor the number of job losers has started
to climb."
   But she added, "We have, however, seen an inching up of
the unemployment rates for factory and construction workers
and, in some cases, rising employment in particular areas of
the country."
   All the numbers in the report were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.
