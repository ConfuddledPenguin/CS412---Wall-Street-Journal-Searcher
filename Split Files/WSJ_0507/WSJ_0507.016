   A Baltimore jury awarded $40 million in punitive damages
to a local broker that had accused Alexander &amp; Alexander
Services Inc. of conspiring to replace it as the insurance
representative for a hospital.
   The award, granted by a jury in Baltimore City Circuit
Court, is believed to be one of the largest ever in a dispute
between insurance brokerage firms over a client relationship.

   B. Dixon Evander &amp; Associates, the Baltimore broker, also
alleged that Alexander conspired to refuse to pay it
commissions due on a policy for University of Maryland
Hospital that Dixon Evander arranged. The jury awarded the
Baltimore broker $250,052 in compensatory damages.
   Dixon Evander claimed the big New York concern interfered
with its contract with the hospital. Since 1975, it had been
the broker firm for the hospital and for Shand, Morahan &amp;
Co., a general underwriting manager for Mutual Fire, Marine &amp;
Inland Insurance, which provided the hospital's malpractice
insurance. Alexander acquired Shand in the early 1980s and
then tried to remove Dixon Evander as the hospital's broker,
the suit alleged.
   Alexander countered that it had what is known as a "broker
of record letter" from the hospital. It had been retained to
help the hospital set up a self-insurance program. It made
certain changes in a malpractice policy originally negotiated
by Dixon Evander but the Baltimore concern claimed it was
entitled to the commissions on the renegotiated policy, which
amounted to $250,052.
   "The jury was outraged by the cavalier attitude of
Alexander &amp; Alexander, which cut the policy premium by
exactly the same amount of Evander's commission and then,
denied that it was rebating," said Ira Cook, a partner at
Birrane, Harlan, Sharretts &amp; Cooke, the Baltimore law firm
which represented Dixon Evander. Rebating, or cutting policy
commissions, is illegal in Maryland and 47 other states.
   Benjamin P. Gill, Alexander's assistant general counsel,
said the company plans to appeal if its requests for a new
trial and a reduced verdict aren't granted.
   Insurance-defense specialist Steven Cozen, of the
Philadelphia law firm of Cozen &amp; O'Connor, says that if this
case is upheld by higher courts it could have significant
impact on how brokers and their clients do business. He said
this verdict raises the question of what protections are
afforded by broker of record letters, which have
traditionally been viewed as binding contracts by brokers.

   JUDGE FINDS PATENT INFRINGEMENT in case involving laser
scanners.
   In federal court in Manhattan, N.Y., Judge Kimba Wood
ruled that Opticon Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of K.K. Opto
Electronics of Japan, infringed on three patents owned by
Symbol Technologies Inc. of Bohemia, N.Y. Symbol Technologies
is the largest U.S. vendor of the laser devices, used to read
prices from bar codes stamped on most packages. The patents
involve handheld "aim and shoot" devices, considered the
fastest growing segment of the scanner market.
   Judge Wood hasn't decided on damages. Symbol said it
expects damages to be awarded, as well as injunction to be
issued halting further sales by Opticon.
   Opticon said it expects to appeal. The company said the
laser products involved represent about 2% of unit sales.
Opticon said it is working on a line of laser scanners that
doesn't contain the product characteristics at issue in the
suit.
   The judge rejected Opticon's claims that the patents were
either invalid or obtained through fraud.

   A JUDGE HEARD ARGUMENTS on lawyers' request to withdraw
from Manuel Noriega's case.
   The defense team in the drug racketeering case complained
that the U.S. cut off their fees by freezing the deposed
Panamanian strongman's assets.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler asked
the government to provide a list of the frozen assets and
their location. He also asked the government to distinguish
between Mr. Noriega's assets that are drug-related and those
that were obtained while he was "gainfully employed."
   Mr. Noriega's lawyers have alleged that he was paid at
least $11 million by the U.S. and between $6 million and $7
million by foreign governments in his position as head of the
Panamanian Defense Force. Those funds, the defense maintains,
shouldn't have to be forfeited.
   Frank Rubino, representing Mr. Noriega, said the defense
team has subpoenaed the Drug Enforcement Agency, the National
Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency to
disclose the amount of money paid to his client.
   Judge Hoeveler set another hearing on the issue for May
11.

   LAWYER-DISCIPLINE HEARINGS are held by American Bar
Association.
   The ABA's Commission on Evaluation of Disciplinary
Enforcement is sponsoring five public hearings around the
country on the effectiveness of the nation's
attorney-discipline systems. The commission's report will be
presented to the ABA's policy-making body in 1991.
   Twenty years have passed since the ABA made a
comprehensive study of attorney-disciplinary procedures, in
which state bar associations typically play a role. In 1970,
a commission headed by former U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Thomas C. Clark concluded that attorney discipline was in
need of serious reform.
   The new commission, headed by Robert McKay, former dean of
New York University School of Law, held hearings in Los
Angeles in February and in New York last week. Remaining
hearings are planned in New Orleans, Chicago, and Portland,
Oregon.

   CRIMINAL-DEFENSE LAWYERS in Montreal are expected to
strike today.
   The planned two-week strike will affect most criminal
proceedings in Quebec Court. The 286 lawyers in private
practice are trying to pressure the Quebec provincial
government to boost legal-aid fees, paid to non-government
lawyers who represent low-income defendants. The fees were
last raised in 1981.
   Although all of the city's criminal-defense lawyers are
expected to strike, only about half take on legal-aid work,
said Michel Massicotte, association president. Each lawyer
will ask for postponements, except in cases in which the
defendent is in prison. Quebec Court in Montreal usually
deals with about 300 cases a day, he said. The strike doesn't
affect jury trials, which are heard in Superior Court. Mr.
Massicotte said judges are expected to grant postponements
because they were denied raises they requested from the
government.
   In Quebec, clients who qualify for legal aid can choose
between a salaried government lawyer or a lawyer in private
practice. Legal aid pays a private lawyer a flat fee per
proceeding.
   "Everybody agrees legal aid fees must be raised," said a
spokeswoman for the Quebec Minister of Justice.
   She called the strike "premature" because the government
hasn't made a final offer.

   HOSPITAL-MALPRACTICE CASE in Texas is settled for $41
million.
   The negligence suit was brought by the parents of Travis
Williams against Fort Worth Children's Hospital, now
Cook-Fort Worth Children's Medical Center. The seven year old
suffered brain damage when his fever rose while he was
recovering from surgery in 1983.
   In February, a state court jury in Fort Worth awarded the
Williams family $17.2 million, including interest. It found
that hospital nurses had negligently allowed the child's
fever to rise to 108 degrees without adequately informing
physicians of the seriousness of his condition. The jury
exonerated the doctors.
   The settlement guarantees payments to the Williams family
for at least the next 50 years that will total about $41
million. Darrell L. Keith, a Fort Worth lawyer who
represented the plaintiffs, said they agreed to accept the
long-term payout in lieu of the lump-sum damage award. In
return, the hospital dropped all appeals.
   The hospital, said it believes there was no negligence and
noted that the settlement is covered by insurance.
