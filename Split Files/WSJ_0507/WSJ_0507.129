   PHOENIX, Calif. -- The government and the unsecured
creditors committee of American Continental Corp. unveiled a
settlement agreement that includes partial payment to
American Continental bondholders and the ouster of Charles A.
Keating Jr. and other senior officials.
   The settlement proposal, presented to Federal District
Judge Richard M. Bilby, requires the approval of the court
and creditors. The plan seeks to liquidate American
Continental, which is operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors. The company's
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary of Irvine, Calif., was
taken over by the government shortly after the bankruptcy
filing in 1989.

   The plan would set aside $21 million to be paid to
American Continental's unsecured creditors, most of whom
invested $200 million in American Continental subordinated
debentures. Those investors, who would be among the last to
be paid in a reorganization, could recoup more if American
Continental is liquidated.
   Mr. Keating, who has sued the government to regain control
of Lincoln, wasn't consulted on the agreement. James J.
Feder, American Continental's lead bankruptcy laywer, said
that the proposal "settles nothing," adding that Mr. Keating
may step down as American Continental's chairman next week to
head up a shareholders' committee to negotiate a
reorganization plan.
   Details of the plan haven't been determined, but may be
presented to the court within a week. They include issues
such as which of American Continental's assets would be
assigned to the Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency
overseeing the U.S.'s thrift bailout.
   Despite the uncertainties, the proposal was seen as a
workable solution by some bondholder representatives. "We
believe the money itself is as well as the bondholders are
going to do, although we don't necessarily agree with all the
terms of the settlement," said Joseph Cotchett, a leading
bondholder attorney. The plan also is a step forward for the
RTC and the unsecured creditors committee, which had been at
odds on many issues.
   American Continental, the government and the bondholders
are still mired in a tangle of litigation not affected by the
settlement plan. The agreement doesn't affect the
government's $1.1 billion racketeering suit against Mr.
Keating and others, in which the U.S. charges that they
engaged in phony tax and loan transactions to divert money
from Lincoln into American Continental. Bondholder suits
against Mr. Keating and others also are pending.
