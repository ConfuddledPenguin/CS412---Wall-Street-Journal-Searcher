   KOHL SAID no obstacles to German reunification remain
following six-power talks.
   The West German foreign ministry concluded that a
statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze indicated
that Moscow is willing to allow reunification to proceed
without immediately addressing the problem of German
membership in NATO, which the Kremlin opposes. Secretary of
State Baker and his advisers were left with the impression
that the Soviet leadership has yet to develop clear positions
on arms control or Germany, even though the Bush-Gorbachev
summit is three weeks away.
