   FRANKLIN, Idaho -- For thousands of hopeful Utahans, La
Tienda is a merchant of dreams.
   Actually, it's a convenience store, and just about the
only retail establishment in this pastoral town of 400 just
north of the Utah border. But besides selling Hostess
Twinkies and pumping gasoline, La Tienda (Spanish for "the
shop") also happens to be the only vendor of Idaho lottery
tickets that's within an easy drive of its more conservative
neighbor to the south.

   Last year, when Idaho approved a lottery, it projected
annual revenue of about $25 million. But it hadn't figured on
a gold rush of gambling-starved patrons from Utah, which
doesn't have a lottery. First-year lottery sales have
rocketed to $53 million, an increase fueled largely by the
Utah buying frenzy.
   While the lottery has been a boon to Idaho coffers, some
Utahans have complained that their state is losing valuable
revenue it could easily capture by adopting a lottery of its
own. But past efforts to create a Utah lottery have failed
miserably in the state Legislature, dominated as it is by
members of the conservative Mormon Church, which frowns on
gambling.
   That leaves La Tienda ideally situated. While Idaho
licenses hundreds of lottery-ticket vendors, the store has
emerged as the state's highest-volume dealer, recently
surpassing $1 million in total sales to date of the $1
tickets. Each day, a steady stream of cars clogs the two-lane
highway that connects Franklin with the more populous Utah
town of Logan, about 21 miles away.
   "The customers start coming in at about 11 a.m., and there
is a line" until dark, says Elaine Hobbs, a co-owner of La
Tienda. Lottery business has been so brisk that the store
enlarged its parking lot and opened a special "scratcher
room," where lottery players sit at picnic tables and peel
away the masking on their instant-style tickets in search of
a winner. It also plans to add a lottery service window to
separate buyers of lottery tickets from regular customers,
some of whom have had to suffer hour-long waits just to pay
for snacks or gasoline.
   The inflow of cold cash isn't the first that La Tienda has
enjoyed because of Utah's political realities, which include
restrictive liquor laws. Long before it became a mecca for
Utah lottery players, notes Mrs. Hobbs, it did a brisk
business selling more than 100 varieties of beer -- most of
which aren't available in Utah.
