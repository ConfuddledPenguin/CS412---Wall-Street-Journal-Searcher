   The U.S. economy is displaying fresh signs of life, but
corporate earnings still are sagging. Many securities
analysts look for another soft profits showing in the current
quarter but expect a pickup in the second half.
   In the 1990 first quarter, net income of 654 major
corporations fell 18% from a year earlier, a Wall Street
Journal survey finds. This compared with a 14% drop in last
year's fourth quarter. After-tax earnings on continuing
operations fell 15%.

<TEXT>
   The inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at an
annual rate of 2.1% in the first quarter -- hardly
spectacular but a substantial improvement over the 1.1% gain
in the fourth quarter. But profits were depressed by
increases in labor costs and interest payments. In addition,
earnings were held down by unusually large writeoffs. In
part, banks were writing off bad loans, but Susan Lakatos, a
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. economist, says that, in addition,
"corporate America is still cleaning up its balance sheet."
   Melissa R. Brown, a Prudential-Bache Securities analyst,
has been pessimistic about earnings for some time, but she
says first-quarter profits "came in worse than expected.
Although earnings for the quarter are not wildly
disappointing, there's not much to cheer about." Even sectors
that did a little better than expected, she says, did less
well than a year ago.
   Richard D. Rippe of Dean Witter Reynolds, however,
believes that continuing moderate increases in growth will
raise business volume. By later this year he expects rising
capacity utilization to widen profit margins. He expects
pretax reported profits for the full year to decline somewhat
less than they did in 1989 and predicts a sharp gain in
earnings in 1991.
   The 51 economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators in general share Mr. Rippe's view. Last
month on the average they forecast a 2.4% drop in pretax
profits this year, down from the 8.3% drop in 1989. But they
predicted that earnings would rise by 7.4% in 1991.
   Among major groups, profits were down sharply in autos,
oil and steel. Most aerospace concerns posted gains but some
had major downturns. Computer company results were mixed.
   The Big Three auto makers took strong medicine to cut
bulging North American vehicle inventories and suffered the
side effects of sharply lower profits. General Motors, Ford
and Chrysler shut nearly all of their U.S. factories for one
to two weeks during January, and slowed output during the
rest of the January-to-March period. At the same time, the
Big Three continued to offer heavy discounts in an effort to
stimulate a sluggish market and hold ground against Japanese
competitors.
   Detroit's first-quarter retrenchment rippled back to auto
parts makers, who saw sales volumes and profits squeezed hard
during the period. And it didn't help relations with the
United Auto Workers union, which will negotiate new contracts
with the Big Three this fall. On the positive side, overall
Big Three inventories now are at relatively lean levels.
   One-time gains last year at Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and
GenCorp create the deceptive appearance of a sharp drop in
first-quarter aerospace and defense industry profitability.
But quarterly earnings for most companies actually rose this
year, and Boeing's operating profit -- after negating a $298
million credit in 1989 from an accounting change -- surged
87% on the strength of its booming airliner deliveries.
Northrop's rise in net income included $67 million in the
latest quarter from the sale of its headquarters building.
Lockheed got better results from its technological services
and aeronautical systems segments -- and found itself free of
write-downs for a change. Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities
noted that despite having operating earnings that generally
have been "really quite upbeat," defense companies, with few
exceptions, have had their stocks hammered because of the
turmoil in the Pentagon budget. Wall Street's reaction, he
says, reflects that even if short-term earnings are strong,
"it's hard to make out a scenario where the aerospace results
will accelerate from here on out."
   Computer makers showed wide variations in profits. But
industry watchers were generally heartened by
better-than-expected news from the two biggest players,
International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, and
they talked of a possible revival in domestic demand, which
has been sluggish for years.
   IBM's strong showing, which included the company's best
U.S. results in recent memory, surprised Wall Street and sent
the stock surging. But IBM has had isolated good quarters
before, and analysts cautioned that the company soon may face
competitive pressures in its backbone business of mainframe
computers.
   Even though Digital's profit fell 90% on a $150 million
charge, analysts were relieved that the company didn't post a
loss, as had been feared. In addition, Digital posted its
first rise in domestic sales in four quarters. Because NCR
and Tandem Computers also had reported modest gains in U.S.
business, analysts smelled a trend and said reports of the
home market's death might have been exaggerated.
   Crude oil prices that were $3 to $4 a barrel higher
boosted exploration and production profits of the major oil
companies. Higher natural gas prices early in the quarter
also contributed. But petrochemical profits declined, largely
because crude is the main feedstock for chemicals. Gasoline
refining and marketing profits were generally weaker for the
same reason. Texaco a year earlier took a $1.19 billion gain
from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc., throwing off results for
the company and the group. Phillips had gains totaling $238
million in the latest quarter and a $90 million charge. Exxon
had a $535 million gain a year earlier.
   Steel industry profits were reduced by sharply lower
volumes and weaker prices because of the general slump in
manufacturing. Auto plant shutdowns and efforts by other
major steel users to cut inventories whacked steel operations
to less than 80% of capacity during January, and the mills
didn't get up to 85% of capacity until the last half of
March. By contrast, the industry operated at nearly 90% of
capacity during the 1989 first quarter. Bethlehem Steel had a
$55 million restructuring charge in the 1989 quarter.
   While the outlook is brighter for the second quarter,
profits, nonetheless, will fall well below the year-ago
period, when most manufacturing was booming. "It remains to
be seen whether the second quarter will be just the
seasonally strongest quarter in a weak year, or something
better than that," says Jeffrey F. Miller, metals analyst
with Duff &amp; Phelps. Shipments of many types of steel are
relatively good, reflecting a general improvement in U.S.
manufacturing and an end to six months or more of inventory
reduction.
   Here are the first-quarter profits for various industry
groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When
individual companies report for three-month periods other
than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are
used. In all the tables, 000s are omitted.

   Aluminum companies felt the manufacturing slowdown in the
quarter. Profits dropped sharply, mainly because of lower
prices. Aluminum ingot prices dropped 40% from a year
earlier; prices for sheet and most other products also
declined, but by a lesser amount. In addition, Aluminum Co.
of America lost can sheet sales because it refused to match
an industry price cut last fall. Aluminum's outlook is
brightening as the manufacturing economy picks up. Shipments
are increasing, and the price of ingot has started to rise.
Nonetheless, second-quarter profits are expected to fall well
below the year-ago period, the peak earnings quarter in an
extremely strong year.
   Some gold companies boosted output significantly and sold
their gold for higher prices, mitigating the impact of higher
cash mining costs. Homestake, for example, increased gold
production by about 33% and sold its gold for about $14 an
ounce more than the year before, posting a nearly twofold
increase in earnings.
   Copper companies' earnings declined on a 20% to 30% drop
in realized copper prices.
   Forest products concerns saw profits drop, citing
softening pulp and paper markets. Georgia-Pacific was also
hurt by higher interest expenses. Besides a decline in price
and demand for pulp, Louisiana-Pacific blamed unusually wet
weather that slowed building activity and precluded some
logging, and uncertainty over interest rates. Willamette was
helped by increased operating efficiencies and
stronger-than-expected building materials markets. At
Weyerhaeuser, lower prices and margins in most pulp and paper
markets were only partially offset by improved results in
forest products.
   Paper companies saw profits fall, citing price
discounting. Bowater's profit drop reflected increased
discounting in the newsprint, coated-paper and pulp markets.
Union Camp cited lower prices for linerboard and uncoated
business paper. Boise Cascade was hurt by lower prices and
sluggish demand for most of its paper grades.
   Chemical industry earnings were down because of weak
demand, price declines and cold weather-related increases in
raw materials costs. Many companies, including Dow, Du Pont
and Monsanto, were affected by slowdowns in the U.S. auto and
construction industries. Analysts say most companies will
continue with flat to negative earnings comparisons this
quarter.

   A pickup in oil field activity in the U.S. and continued
exploration activity world-wide contributed to strong gains
for the equipment companies and drillers. While the increase
in activity was not huge, companies have trimmed so much from
their cost structures that any increase in business flows
quickly to the bottom line. Even some long-suffering contract
drilling companies, which narrowed their losses, believe an
end to their red ink is in sight.
   Natural gas pipeline companies, despite one of the warmest
first quarters on record, managed generally higher net in
come, what with special items, non-pipeline operations and
Panhandle's acquisition of Texas Eastern. Panhandle's results
for the rest of 1990 will be hurt by high interest expense,
possible cash refunds to customers and ambitious capital
spending.
   Coal industry results were mixed, with good weather,
productivity gains and mining expansions helping some
producers boost profits. Ashland Coal revenue grew 18%,
largely from the recent acquisition of new mines.

   The rail group's earnings decline reflected a drop in
carloadings of motor vehicles, metal products and other
higher-value freight. But Burlington Northern and Norfolk
Southern benefited from strong coal shipments. First-quarter
losses at Santa Fe resulted from a litigation settlement.
Some analysts predict modest rail-traffic gains in the second
quarter.
   Trucking company profits were hurt by higher fuel and
labor costs as continued rate discounting held down revenue.
Consolidated Freightways' first-quarter results reflected
losses at its Emery Worldwide air-freight unit.
   The two largest air-freight carriers, Federal Express and
United Parcel Service, are still racking up large operating
losses on their efforts to expand overseas, offset somewhat
by recent price stabilization in the U.S. Federal Express is
also still struggling to meld its Tiger purchase,
particularly the seniority lists of its pilots. Paul
Schlesinger, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
expects revenue for the industry to continue growing in the
10%-to-15%-a-year range, with profit growth remaining spotty.
   Among the marine transport concerns, American President's
loss stemmed from competitive pressures in its Asia
transportation business and thinner profit margins at its
freight-brokerage operation.
   The sharp slump in the market for big trucks, diesel
engines and other parts continued to depress profits.
Cummins, which supplies about half the diesel engines for
heavy-duty trucks, said first-quarter production in North
America for those trucks fell 23% from a year ago. Although
they expect no immediate rebound, some companies, including
Cummins and Eaton, predict improved truck demand late in
1990.
   Several heavy-machinery makers continued to benefit from
increased demand for their products, though some reported
slowdowns in certain areas. Clark Equipment, for example,
said its U.S. forklift and off-highway components businesses
are in a "slight downturn." Although business for equipment
used in road repairs and mining remains strong, Caterpillar
continues to be hurt by soft demand for machines used in
private construction projects, particularly in the U.S. It's
not optimistic about the rest of the year. But Deere is
likely to continue its strong gains in agricultural machinery
as farmers continue their mini-spending spree. Larry D.
Hollis, an analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee,
said improved industrial production later in the year should
help machinery makers.

   Many builders reported higher earnings in the quarter, but
the profits mask underlying trouble. Relatively stable
mortgage interest rates during the winter months helped buoy
sales; among national concerns, diversification into healthy
markets such as California and the Pacific Northwest also
helped. But recent rate increases on mortgages and a
liquidity crisis for builders induced by tighter thrift
lending laws have created worries for the second-quarter
outlook.
   Retailers are expected to report mixed results for the
April quarter. Discounting wasn't as prevalent as in the
important fourth quarter, and some apparel stores fared well.
But demand for goods sold by general merchants was soft,
hurting profits for some. Sears Roebuck, which is on a
calendar year, reported a big drop in profit because of what
it called an "unsatisfactory" performance by its giant U.S.
retail operation; the unit's loss widened to $134.2 million
from $42.7 million a year earlier, when results were helped
by publicity surrounding the company's launch of its
"everyday low pricing" strategy. K mart is expected to report
earnings that, at best, will be slightly higher than a year
ago.
   Lodging companies reflected the usual seasonal
fluctuations, while casino companies reported mixed results
largely because of the vagaries of luck at the gambling
tables. Marriott's results didn't include airline catering
operations that were shed last year. Hilton Hotels bene fited
from sharp improvement in its casino segment. Golden Nugget
soared because of business at its new Mirage resort, which is
expected to give Las Vegas a boost during the spring and
summer seasons.
   Restaurant companies are still battling fiercely for
market share, particularly in the high-profile, fast-food
segment. That the latest quarter is also the industry's
slowest of the season was evidenced by the failure of both
McDonald's and Wendy's International to meet sales
expectations. But smaller, niche companies seem to remain in
control of their own destinies. For example, the benefits of
franchising growth, aggressive advertising and tighter
quality controls are starting to kick in at Shoney's, a big
regional player in the family-restaurant market.
   In recreational products, the first quarter is a
seasonally low one for movie companies, particularly those
that don't enjoy a big "spillover" from their Christmas
films. This hurt Paramount, which was also affected by the
seasonality of its publishing business. Disney managed
another record-breaking quarter in spite of a disappointing
slate of films (redeemed by the March release of "Pretty
Woman") and the lack of the Easter holiday falling in the
quarter, which affected the theme parks. Summer box office
projections so far look as strong as last year's record
level.
   In the media sector, heavy demand for commercial time on
the television networks led to a strong quarter for some
concerns. CBS was boosted by its Super Bowl telecast. Capital
Cities/ABC climbed with help from strong gains in broadcast
revenue, which includes the network and eight TV stations.
ABC's network and stations saw strong advertising demand and
healthy ratings, except for the daytime schedule.
   The nation's economic sluggishness dragged down earnings
for most of those media companies with major daily newspapers
and magazines. They were hit on two levels: falling spending
by national advertisers and a continued slump in local retail
ads. National and retail ad spending levels aren't expected
to improve through 1990.
   Newspaper publishers' earnings were helped by lower
newsprint costs and industrywide cost cutting.
   Fuel costs that soared by as much as 27% pummeled airline
earnings. In addition, soft demand for travel early in the
quarter made it hard for airlines to get fare increases to
stick. Those factors caused many airlines to post losses,
with the rest reporting meager profits. Analysts expect a
better second quarter, although the improvement will be
small. AMR, parent of American Airlines, ended a string of
eight consecutive quarters of profit with its first loss
since 1987. United's parent, UAL, was hurt by a one-time,
$77.5 million payment to Texas Air's Continental to settle
charges that United competed unfairly in the
computer-reservation business.
   For some apparel and textile makers, the seasonally
sluggish first quarter saw lackluster retail sales and
depressed earnings, though others posted healthy gains. At
Hartmarx, menswear sales at retail and wholesale continue to
lag.

   For most food companies, solid sales gains, coupled with
leaner operations, combined to boost earnings. Tyson realized
a hefty sales gain, reflecting its acquisition of Holly
Farms, while General Mills benefited from unit volume
increases on both its consumer foods and restaurant sides.
Corn refining fueled much of CPC International's profit
increase. But below-normal sales growth in ready-to-eat
cereals stung Kellogg, and ongoing problems in its
Fisher-Price toy business dragged down Quaker's numbers. At
Ralston-Purina, a hefty sales gain was largely offset by
costs of a pet-food plant closure and settlement of
patent-infringement litigation. Unusual items skewed results
at Whitman, where year-ago earnings were augmented with gains
from pension plans and favorable currency adjustments.
McCormick's results last year included $80 million from
discontinued real estate operations.
   Food retailers, aided by improved margins on brisk sales,
generally posted impressive overall gains during the quarter.
Companies that weren't profitable, including Circle K and
Kroger, cited costs associated with recent acquisitions or
restructuring efforts. What one analyst called the
"surprisingly good" results should carry over into the
current quarter.
   As pricing concerns seemed to fade, most of the beverage
group's earnings rose on higher volumes. Strong overseas
sales bolstered Coca-Cola Co.'s earnings, while PepsiCo's
results rose despite continued expenses related to a
multibillion-dollar acquisition spree. A 2.9% increase in
beer sales to wholesalers boosted profit for Anheuser-Busch.
The surprise brewer in the quarter was Adolph Coors, which,
led by sales gains for its Coors Light and Keystone brands,
posted an earnings turnaround. In the second quarter, Wheat
First Securities' John Maxwell sees per-share earnings gains
of 20% for Coke, 16% for Pepsi and 12% for Anheuser-Busch
compared with a year earlier.
   Higher Medicare rates and stabilized hospital admissions
fueled continued profit growth among health care companies.
Humana's advance reflected a turnaround in its health
maintenance organization subsidiary while National Medical
Enterprises showed improved results at its acute-care
hospitals. Community Psychiatric profit was off slightly as
insurers increased their scrutiny of usage at psychiatric
facilities. Kenneth S. Abramowitz, analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, sees current-quarter growth generally in the
midteens.
   Results at medical supply concerns were mixed. Baxter
International's big loss reflected a restructuring while C.R.
Bard continued to struggle with the effects of recalling its
angioplasty catheter. Bausch &amp; Lomb was propelled by strong
international sales and its optics business.
   Profit growth slowed somewhat for most major drug makers.
The industry is under stiffening pressure to hold down
prices, which had been rising by about twice the inflation
rate the past few years. Meanwhile, some U.S. makers were
buffeted by currency translations due to the strong U.S.
dollar abroad and by competition from generic drugs.
   Personal care companies reported mixed results during the
first quarter. International sales were strong, but a weak
U.S. retail environment hurt some companies. Margins got a
small boost as materials costs stayed low and consumer prices
increased slightly. More of the same is expected during the
second quarter.
   Among household product concerns, profit margins continued
to expand, thanks in part to an extended truce in the
consumer goods marketing wars. Margins got an additional
boost as most manufacturers avoided new-product
introductions. With sales overseas continuing strong, the
outlook for the coming quarter is also bright. At Clorox,
however, earnings dropped slightly from the year-earlier
period, as the company spent heavily to roll out a new
detergent and several other products.
   Despite a troubled image, tobacco makers reported strong
gains, driven by robust sales overseas and
smaller-than-expected volume decreases in the U.S. Analysts
expect continued strong profits this quarter. Philip Morris's
earnings were powered by strength at its domestic tobacco and
Miller Brewing operations.

   In office equipment, results were down, but one-time items
masked some bright spots. Xerox reported record losses on a
$375 million charge related to bad real estate investments,
but it posted strong profit gains in its core
document-processing operation. Analysts noted, however, that
revenue on equipment sales rose a meager 2%, and they feared
for the rest of the year.
   Is the chip industry out of the woods after a year of
sluggish growth? Semiconductor sales are up, chip gluts have
dried up, prices have stopped plummeting and makers have even
put some semiconductors on allocation, sparking a barrage of
better-than-expected profit reports. But chip makers warn
that it's too soon to know whether the pickup will last.
Although National Semicondcutor posted a loss, it reported
strong bookings late in the period.
   Software and data processing companies reported mixed
results. Ashton-Tate's performance was hurt because of
continuing delays in shipping new data-base products, while
Oracle Systems reported only a slight earnings increase
because of an unexpected accounting glitch that resulted in
lower-than-expected revenue. Microsoft showed strong gains as
did Lotus, whose performance benefited by comparison with a
relatively weak year-ago quarter.
   Profits from telecommunications services defied a
generally weak earnings environment as traffic volume from
corporate customers remained brisk and cost-reduction
programs improved margins. The second quarter and beyond
could bring further profit boosts as carriers begin to sell
services based on features rather than price. Market leader
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph couldn't match its profit
growth of 18% in last year's first quarter.
   On the equipment side, cut-throat pricing and sluggish
orders from phone companies and corporate customers continued
to hurt margins. This probably won't improve much through the
next quarter.

   For banks, "the first quarter was an extremely difficult
period," said James J. McDermott Jr. of Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods Inc. Looking at the 150 banking companies Keefe tracks,
results showed a 1% median earnings decline. Results varied
widely by region: Banks in the Northeast showed a 30% decline
-- reflecting "a lot of real estate problems" -- while banks
in the West were up 11%, the analyst said. Banks continued to
be hounded by bad loans and lower corporate-finance fees, but
some bucked the trend. The top two, Citicorp and Chase,
boosted provisions for possible losses on real estate loans;
Citicorp's consumer business world-wide continued strong,
however. Absent an accounting change in the latest period,
J.P. Morgan's net fell 6%. And looking ahead, "pressures
evident in the first quarter are likely to be visited" on the
industry in the second period, as the "economy continues soft
and credit quality remains an ongoing concern," he said.
   The increases in premium rates that many property/casualty
insurers had expected to see failed to materialize.
Underwriting results deteriorated because of the weak
pricing. Companies writing personal auto and other consumer
insurance products, such as Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Cigna,
Travelers, Xerox's Crum &amp; Forster unit, and New Hampshire
Insurance, a unit of American International Group, have
announced plans to cut back on their personal lines or leave
this business entirely as a way to stem losses.
   Several thrifts benefited from increased interest income
and improved margins, in part because of measures implemented
under last summer's massive thrift bailout.
   Though the bailout has largely flopped, it did enable
regulators to shut down some of the sicker thrifts, which had
been paying large premiums to attract deposits; those
premiums had forced up funding costs, even at healthy
thrifts. As some of the sick thrifts have been closed,
funding costs at many institutions have come down, boosting
margins. Great Western Financial's net interest margin -- the
difference between what it pays for money and earns on assets
-- rose to 3.01 from 2.43 a year ago, helping lift net
interest income 24% to a record $286 million. H.F. Ahmanson's
net interest margin increased to 2.68 from 2.41 and net
interest income rose 21% to $286.4 million; it also generated
$3.1 billion from loan sales, compared with $249 million from
loan sales a year earlier. Golden West, which has the
toughest cost controls in the industry, saw net interest
income increase 24% to $125.2 million.
   Securities brokers' profits remained depressed in a
sluggish investment-banking environment and a falling stock
market. But year-to-year profit comparisons were generally
positive because the year-earlier period was also a poor one.
Most big brokerage firms, including industry leader Merrill
Lynch, suffered 20% to 30% declines in investment banking
revenue. Salomon's profit turnaround resulted from trading
gains for its own account, which offset losses in its
commodities unit. The bright spot for brokers was that most
continued to increase customer assets under management.
Analysts say brokers' earnings will remain weak this quarter.

   Several phone companies reported hefty earnings gains, but
a few had declines, primarily because of higher expenses.
   United Telecommunications showed strong improvement in its
long-distance business. So did MCI Communications, despite
heavy capital investment and a steeper effective tax rate. U
S West, Bell Atlantic and Nynex reported solid gains, aided
by non-telephone operations such as cellular service. Nynex
results would have been even higher except for a $39 million
pretax charge for an early-retirement program.

   ITT called its results "better than expected"; profit
before tax and interest on all businesses except electronic
parts equaled or exceeded year-ago levels. The latest quarter
reflected a $47 million gain on the sale of its investment in
Compagnie Generale d'Electricite. Without the gain, net grew
3%. At Textron, "balanced diversity" gave it "a good start on
the year, despite softness in several of our markets," the
company said. Continued strength in finance and insurance
more than offset the current slowdown in its automotive
divisions. Per-share net was flat as shares outstanding rose
4%. GE continued double-digit earnings growth into a fourth
consecutive year, though NBC broadcasting reported "somewhat"
lower revenue and profit and the materials unit was weak.
   Candice Eggerss of Morgan Stanley is estimating $4.90 a
share for GE in 1990, up 12% from $4.36 in 1989. With the com
pany's stock buy-back program and productivity improvements,
"I'm confident of double-digit {earnings} improvement this
year," she says.
