   Aerosol Alternatives
   Rush Into the Market

   SPURRED ON by environmental worries, the aerosol industry
is looking for new ways to dispense from a can.
   Ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons are banned from most
of the three billion aerosol cans sold each year in the U.S.
But many aerosols still are propelled by propane or other
hydrocarbons, which contribute to smog.
   Some newer manufacturers opt for pumps and other
mechanical solutions. Enviro-Spray Systems, a division of CLC
Technologies Inc. of Toronto, inserts a flexible pouch into
its aerosol can. The pouch contains citric acid and sodium
bicarbonate in separate inner compartments, which are
ruptured just before the can is filled with product. Mixed,
they form carbon dioxide, which expands the pouch and later
forces out the contents.
   Ultramotive Corp. of Bethel, Vt., develops a piston to
push the product out while preventing the compressed air
below from seeping around the piston and mixing with the
contents.
   The solution at Exxel Container Inc. of Somerset, N.J., is
to insert a flexible plastic bottle, surrounded with a rubber
sleeve, into the container. The sleeve expands when the inner
bottle is filled and contracts, forcing out product, when the
consumer pushes the valve.
   But William Gregg, a vice president at Precision Valve Co.
in Yonkers, N.Y., says mechanicals are much costlier and
produce a coarser spray than traditional aerosols.
   Instead, Precision and other makers of traditional
aerosols are turning in two directions. One is toward carbon
dioxide and other compressed gases. Those produce a fine
spray but have uneven pressure. Summit Packaging Systems of
Manchester, N.H., says it can even out the pressure with a
tiny laser-drilled hole in the valve body.
   The aerosol majors are also working on liquefied gases
such as hydrofluorocarbons, which don't hurt the ozone layer
or cause smog. "HFCs are the wave of the future," says Mike
SanGiovanni, editor of Aerosol Age, a trade journal.
                                                                                                       

   A Japanese Tile Sounds
   Good, Except for Price
                                                                                                       

   AFTER FLOPPING in an earlier run, a Japanese made
acoustical tile is trying again to win U.S. fans.
   Almute is a thin sheet of "sintered" aluminum, that is,
powders bonded together under high temperatures. It's 40% air
and sends back only 10% of the sound that hits it. Peer
International Corp. of Wheeling, Ill., its new importer, says
the tiles are better looking and more effective than
conventional mass-market acoustical materials -- fiberglass
and mineral fiber.
   Made by NDC Co. of Japan, Almute sold poorly when first
introduced in the U.S. a decade ago under the name Calme.
Peer International thinks Almute will have a better chance
this time, partly because the material has since proven
itself in Japan, where it's been used in Hiroshima's city
hall, Nissan Motor headquarters, theaters and even the koala
room at a zoo.
   The U.S. market is looking up. Architects have specified
Almute for lobby renovation at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., and at the new Denver airport.
   But cost remains an impediment. Almute sells for $7 to $14
a square foot, a lot more than conventional materials. "I'm
very interested," says San Francisco acoustical consultant
Elizabeth Cohen. "But at those prices, you need a
sky's-the-limit budget."
                                                                                                       

   When Half a Tread
   Is Better Than One
                                                                                                       

   MOVE ASIDE, old ladder-type stairs.
   Lapeyre Stair of New Orleans makes a staircase with
alternating treads that it says is safer and more comfortable
than the vertical ladders or steeply sloping stairs found on
ships and in factories.
   The Lapeyre model eliminates one side of a conventional
stair tread, allowing the foot to reach its next tread
directly. The tread depth makes it easier to descend facing
outward and to carry small loads up or down.
   Lapeyre has sold about 10,000 staircases so far, mostly to
industry. The Navy has recently bought one to test on a
destroyer. Eticam Co., a Fernley, Nev., waste-storage
company, has 30. Plant engineer Jim Bosley says his only
reservation is that once you've started up or down a Lapeyre,
it's hard to change your mind and go the other way.
   The Lapeyre stair -- even the wooden residential model --
isn't for everyone. Bob Larson, the company's general
manager, concedes he "wouldn't recommend it" for handicapped
people or small children.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   KEEP OUT: Blair Industries of Boca Raton, Fla., sells a
guard device for parking places. Bolted to the ground, the
hinged steel gadget can be flipped up to become a 20-inch
high barrier, after a car is driven away. . . . People Power:
The Society of Environmental Graphic Designers in Cambridge,
Mass., says entries in this year's sign competition will be
judged by two juries -- professional designers and members of
the public.
