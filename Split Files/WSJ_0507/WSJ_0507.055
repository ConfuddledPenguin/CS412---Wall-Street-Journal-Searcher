   A little more than a year after introducing Chelsea, "the
first cigarette that smells good," RJR Nabisco has begun
test-marketing Horizon, "the first cigarette that smells
good."
   The food and tobacco giant, still pushing to design a
cigarette that is less annoying to nonsmokers, hasn't
formally introduced Horizon, but "scratch and sniff"
pamphlets trumpeting the brand arrived on doorsteps in
Atlanta last week. The company has been hawking Chelsea in
other test markets since March 1989.

   Both Chelsea and Horizon exude a scent similar to vanilla
that RJR marketers think is less objectionable to nonsmokers
than typical cigarette smoke. The brands have slightly
different blends of tobacco, said an RJR spokeswoman, but
they use the same paper to give off the unusual scent.
   RJR has found that Chelsea, targeted at women, is equally
popular among men and women. Horizon, the spokeswoman said,
"gives us an opportunity to test one brand vs. another and to
see whether the {sweetsmelling} attribute itself is what
people are looking for, or whether the image of the brand can
change how smokers feel about it."
   But one marketing executive with another large tobacco
company said the introduction of Horizon suggests that RJR
isn't happy with Chelsea. The executive, who asked not to be
identified, said her company's tally puts Chelsea with a 0.2%
share of the cigarette market in its test areas in
Pennsylvania and Nevada, and a 0.5% share in Florida. Those
numbers, she said, are below what companies normally require
before rolling out a product nationwide.
   RJR declined to comment on the numerical results of its
test-marketing.
   RJR may be running into the same problems that it
encountered when it introduced the heralded Premier
"smokeless cigarette" in test markets in 1988. The $300
million experiment flopped in part because RJR, trying to
find a cigarette or a facsimile to satisfy nonsmokers'
concerns, ignored basic needs of smokers, such as the
cigarette's taste, smell and feel.
   Judging from RJR's pamphlet on Horizon, the new cigarette,
too, is primarily aimed at the concerns of nonsmokers. Large
letters on the three-page fold-out tell smokers: "You
shouldn't have to apologize," "You shouldn't have to make
excuses," and "You shouldn't have to leave the room." The
advertisement goes on to say: "You'll also be pleased to know
that Horizon won't leave your clothes, hair, car and home
smelling like your regular cigarettes."
   Jeffery Wack, a professor of public health at Yale
University and a marketing consultant with Marketing Sciences
Inc. in New Haven, Conn., doubts that nonsmokers will take
any more kindly to aromatic cigarettes than normal varieties,
as long as they contain the same carcinogens. "If the
pollutants are still there but it just smells differently,"
he said, "you don't eliminate the major objection."
   But the RJR spokeswoman said: "We think the concept is
sound enough to warrant tinkering with and coming up with an
alternative brand. If we believed it wasn't, we wouldn't do
it."
