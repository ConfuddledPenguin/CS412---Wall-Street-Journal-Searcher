   Machinists members at McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s St. Louis
operations approved a three-year contract yesterday after the
company and the union reached agreement during a marathon,
11th-hour bargaining session.
   As of last Thursday, the Machinists' negotiating committee
had rejected what was described as the aerospace concern's
final offer, and the rank and file seemed to be clamoring for
a strike. But, at the urging of McDonnell Douglas, the two
sides returned to the bargaining table at 10 o'clock Friday
morning and stayed there until 3 a.m. Saturday, when a new
accord was reached.

   "We've been through a tough round of negotiations, but it
all paid off," said Vince DeBlaze, the company's top official
for the labor talks.
   The membership ratified the contract, which features
improvements in both wages and benefits over the earlier
proposal, by 69%. It covers about 11,000 workers at McDonnell
Douglas's jet-fighter plant, and another 1,000 employees at
the company's missile factory.
   The biggest concession that the union wrested during the
weekend was the ability to fold wage gains and cost-of-living
adjustments into the base salary of those workers who are at
the bottom of the scale. That means everyone signed to the
contract -- no matter what their experience level -- will
enjoy the full value of the 5.5%, 3% and 3% wage increases
the pact provides. Lump-sum bonuses of 4% will also be given
annually.
   "Bringing up the minimum wage rates significantly improves
the situation for future hires," said Lee Pearson, a
representative of the Machinists' international office. He
added, for example, that if the company hadn't succumbed on
the wage and COLA issue, a newly recruited hydraulic press
and hammer operator could have made $13.36 an hour. Now, that
person will be entitled to at least $15.75 an hour.
   The union also captured better health benefits for its
retirees, including prescription-drug cards.
   "We drained about as much financial blood as we could,"
said Cassell Williams, president of Machinists District Lodge
837. He added that he thought McDonnell Douglas couldn't
afford a walkout given the company's "weak financial
position" and the uncertain outlook for defense contractors.
   At the fighter plant, McDonnell Douglas assembles F-15
Eagles for the Air Force, F/A-18 Hornets for the Navy and
AV8-B Harriers for the Marine Corps. The White House and
members of Congress are eyeing all of these projects as
possible targets for termination, given the improvement in
East-West relations.
