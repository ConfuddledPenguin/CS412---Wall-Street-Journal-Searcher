   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association reported a $293.3
million first-quarter net loss, reflecting further decay in
the company's junk-bond portfolio, although officials claimed
progress in a last-ditch effort to sell the bonds and finally
end the flood of unprofitability.
   Separately, the company, based in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
disclosed what some analysts considered to be a surprisingly
lucrative compensation arrangement with its new president and
chief executive officer -- and some big pay cuts for members
of the controlling Spiegel family.

   The loss, equal to $14.62 a share, is somewhat wider than
Columbia indicated in April when the company said it would
have a deficit of at least $200 million based on junk-bond
losses in January and February. The company had profit of
$7.9 million, or 20 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. The latest result indicates that the monthly rate of
deterioration in the thrift-industry-leading portfolio,
valued at about $2.9 billion at March 31, slowed somewhat in
March but still lost $50 million, despite firming in the
overall junk market.
   As a result, Columbia, insolvent since Feb. 28, was pushed
further under. At March 31, it reported a stockholders'
deficit of $215.6 million. Moreover, at that date, the
company needed to raise $338.3 million to comply with minimum
federal tangible capital requirements. Many analysts question
whether Columbia can survive without federal help, and some
said continued erosion in the value of its junk bonds was an
ominous signal.
   Columbia officials said they were encouraged about the
level of interest in their previously reported plan to sell
the junk. Columbia said its financial adviser, First Boston
Corp., had obtained "several qualifying bids" to purchase
substantially all of the portfolio and that discussions with
a select number of parties were intensifying.
   Columbia's president and chief executive officer, Edward
G. Harshfield, said, "I feel very confident about doing the
transaction at book {value}, if not better." He added: "I am
still optimistic that we can put together a transaction to
satisfy all our constituents," including regulators. "We
anticipate being able to say something publicly by late June
or early July."
   But a sale at current book value won't put a dent in
Columbia's insolvency, so many thrift experts still expect
Columbia to be taken over by federal regulators.
   Columbia is trying to attract investor interest with an
offer to finance as much as about 90% of the purchase price
-- and with a sales pitch that recent declines in the market
don't reflect the securities' long-term value. Regulators,
having approved the financing terms, are considered as eager
as the company to put the bonds in someone else's hands; the
Resolution Trust Corp. already holds roughly $4 billion in
junk bonds from failed thrifts that it has taken over.
Columbia wouldn't name the bidders or the level of bids.
   Other analysts are skeptical about whether the proposed
transaction, internally code-named "The Big Lift," will ever
get off the ground because of the risks. Roughly $1 billion,
or about 30% of the portfolio, is classified as troubled or
not accruing interest. About $800 million is considered
extremely difficult to value because it was issued in private
placements. Some analysts said there are better buying
opportunities available.
   "The way Columbia appears headed, a takeover seems
imminent. Why not let the RTC take over and buy from the RTC?
Then, you don't have the artificial restraint to buy the
entire package," said Kenneth Thomas, a Miami thrift analyst
and consultant.
   Even if Columbia succeeds in selling most of the bonds
without further losses, analysts said, the company would
still need an equity infusion of as much as several hundred
million dollars to fully comply with federal capital rules
that become effective in 1994. A person close to the company
said it may propose swapping about $100 million in
convertible debt for equity, a move that would boost capital
but ensure that current holders would be essentially wiped
out.
   Columbia has said that it is considering alternatives for
its bond portfolio, including a phased divestiture. Indeed,
Columbia said it sold $245.4 million in junk bonds and
preferred stock in the first quarter, and has sold roughly
$620 million since August. The $2.9 billion book value of
Columbia's junk bonds and preferred has declined from the
$4.5 billion peak last year.
   Separately, Columbia disclosed with the Office of Thrift
Supervision that it is paying Mr. Harshfield $500,000 a year,
and that he could earn as much as $3.4 million in salary and
bonuses over three years, not counting profits from options
granted to him covering one million Columbia shares. Mr.
Harshfield is a former Citicorp and Household International
Inc. executive and was hired with clearance from regulators
in March to succeed Thomas Spiegel as chief executive.
   The yearly salary is less than what some other large
thrift chief executives earn, although some analysts thought
the total terms were a little rich.
   Mr. Spiegel, who has been doing consulting work for
Columbia on the junk-bond sale, and his father, Abraham,
Columbia's chairman, are doing much less well. According to
the filing, Thomas Spiegel's pay was "at the behest of
regulators" recently reduced to $1 a year from $41,666 a
month. According to a person close to the company, Abraham
Spiegel's compensation has been reduced to standard director
fees of about $12,000 a year and may soon be reduced to zero.
Last year, he earned about $500,000.
