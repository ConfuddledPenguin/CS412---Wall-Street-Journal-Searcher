   LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said it's establishing an
after-tax charge of $19.5 million, or 35 cents a share, in
its second quarter for its arbitration loss to a former
executive of its Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben unit.
   In last year's second quarter, the insurance and financial
services concern earned $121.7 million, or $2.46 a share,
including profit from discontinued operations of $67.2
million.

   A panel of the National Association of Securities Dealers
has awarded the former executive $38.2 million. The award
stems from a disagreement over his employment contract, and
is one of the largest such awards in the securities business.
   Kemper said Prescott, a brokerage concern, will contest
and try to vacate the award.
