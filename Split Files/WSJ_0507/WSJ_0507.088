   Fox Inc. won a big victory in its effort to make further
inroads against the three broadcast networks without adhering
to federal rules blocking the networks from the booming
rerun-sales business.
   But the Fox win also improved the Big Three's chances of
easing the rules or eliminating them entirely.

   The Fox network now airs programs three nights a week and
plans to add two more nights and a daytime children's lineup
by next fall. Adding the shows would have forced Fox -- which
is set to reap a fortune on sales of reruns of TV series made
by its own studio -- to follow the same rules that have
barred ABC, CBS and NBC from the rerun business for two
decades.
   Now the Federal Communications Commission has ruled that
Fox can add the new programming without the risk of
triggering the rerun restrictions, known as the Financial
Interest and Syndication Rules, or "fin-syn." It is a blow to
Fox's three bigger rivals, which have lost a sizable share of
the prime-time audience to the upstart and had opposed Fox's
request for a temporary waiver of the FCC rules.
   "It's incredibly important for us. Obviously, we're
delighted," says Jamie Kellner, president of Fox
Broadcasting, the network entity of Fox Inc. that is owned by
News Corp. While the Big Three networks can't syndicate
shows, Fox takes in more than $25 million a year in selling
the tabloid-news show "A Current Affair" to local stations.
Fox stands to reap a far larger fortune a few years hence on
reruns of "L.A. Law," which its studio makes for the NBC
network, and on reruns of the Fox network's screwy new
cartoon hit, "The Simpsons," which Fox also owns.
   But network officials believe the latest action signals
that the FCC will take a dim view of the burdensome fin-syn
rules when it begins a major review next month of whether to
lift the regulations. The networks are in stalled talks with
Hollywood studios -- which take in hundreds of millions of
dollars in rerun profits thanks to the rules -- to try to
craft a compromise for easing the network restrictions.
   "The commission obviously now is wrestling with the
reality that these rules do impose restrictions on networks
which are difficult to justify in today's world," says
Stephen A. Weiswasser, general counsel at Capital Cities/ABC
Inc., which owns the ABC network. At the very least, the FCC
move may strengthen the networks' hand in the talks with the
studios.
   A spokesman for NBC, a unit of General Electric Co.,
echoed those hopes. But NBC criticized the FCC ruling as
giving Fox an unfair edge and as an impediment to efforts to
ease the rerun provisions. "Granting special treatment for
Fox is unfair and counterproductive to the current round of
negotiations," the NBC spokesman said. "It removes the
immediate pressure on Fox and the studios to reach a
settlement."
   The FCC, which approved the Fox waiver 4-0, tried to blunt
speculation by stressing its ruling "in no way prejudges or
foreshadows" how it will rule on whether to lift the
regulations. But an FCC official said privately that the
waiver shows the commission's determination to spur
competition with the Big Three networks -- and a willingness
to grant them greater leeway in syndication. The official
asked, "Having given something to {Fox}, how can we not give
it" to the major networks?
   The FCC waiver gives Fox, now airing nine hours of
programming each week, the freedom to go up to 18 1/2 hours
of shows without having to follow the rerun rules. (FCC
regulations define a network as any service airing more than
15 hours a week, and Fox had sought a waiver from the 15-hour
cap.) In return, Fox vows to forgo acquiring an ownership
stake in programs supplied by other studios, since the rules
prohibit the networks from taking such a stake.
   The FCC's waiver, however, is so limited that Fox may yet
have to side with the Big Three networks and against its own
studio siblings in the rerun battle. The waiver won't let Fox
go beyond 18 1/2 hours, and it lasts for only a year. If the
FCC hasn't resolved the fin-syn debate in a year, Fox would
have to scale back its program lineup to fall under the
15-hour cap -- or withdraw from the rerun business
altogether.
   Generally, the studios in the rerun fight have appealed to
members of Congress, who are big beneficiaries of Hollywood's
campaign contributions. But such influential lawmakers as
House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.)
have said they back the FCC in its efforts to resolve the
issue. Now the FCC may be tilting away from Hollywood and
toward the broadcasters.
