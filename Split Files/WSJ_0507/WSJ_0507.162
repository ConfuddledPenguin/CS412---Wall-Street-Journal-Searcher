   VALENCIA, Calif. -- Huntway Partners L.P. said it expects
to make a first-quarter distribution to its preference unit
holders after reaching agreements for a capital infusion and
restructuring of the partnership's bank loan.
   Huntway, a refiner of asphalt and petroleum products,
declared a distribution of 34.5 cents a unit, payable May 30
to preference units of record May 15. But Huntway said that
the payment is contingent upon completion before May 30 of
the capital infusion and the revised bank loan.

   Huntway's operating committee agreed to a proposal by
Bankers Trust Co. to restructure the partnership's debt into
a $17 million term loan and a $31 million letter of credit
and working capital facility. Huntway said it must make
quarterly payments on the proposed term loan, which must be
paid off by the end of 1993.
   Huntway said it expects to receive $5 million from the
sale of 625,000 units, at $8 each, to an affiliate of its
general partner. The sale would increase by 12% the number of
Huntway's preference units outstanding to about 6.2 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Huntway's preference units rose 62.5 cents, to close at $7.50
after trading was delayed pending dissimination of news about
the agreements. Members of management and a private investor
hold common units that aren't publicly traded.
   Huntway said that future distributions to preference unit
holders will be permitted under the revised bank agreement if
the partnership's operating performance meets "certain
targeted levels." A spokesman said the partnership hopes to
meet those targets, but cautioned that he couldn't make any
guarantees. Distributions on the common units won't be made
until the term loan has been reduced to $5 million, Huntway
said.
