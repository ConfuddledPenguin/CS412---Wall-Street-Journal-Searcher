   TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu gave what
the Japanese had billed as a major policy address to India's
Parliament last week, asserting that Japan has decided to
play a larger role in Asian affairs. The message was repeated
at the four other stops on his weeklong Asian tour,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Indonesia. Japan would
use its economic and technological muscle to help build a
"new international order."
   It will come as no particular surprise that this statement
hardly made a ripple in the world press. The world has grown
accustomed to regarding Japan as an economic giant but a
political pygmy. In part, that's because the Japanese have
preferred it that way. Gradually, very gradually, that image
may require alteration. Japan probably will become a larger
player in world politics, whether it wants to or not.

   One reason Mr. Kaifu didn't get much attention is that he
has been regarded as a caretaker prime minister. That theory
may have to be revised too. Polls show that his popularity is
rising in Japan, partly because he is identified with Japan's
transition from a single-minded focus on exports to economic
policies designed to give the Japanese more of the fruits of
their labors. His Asian tour was an assertion of
self-confidence that no doubt was directed not only at the
world but also at his elders in the Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP). Up until recently, there had been subtle hints that
his tenure as the LDP's Mr. Clean will end once the party has
put the Recruit scandal well behind it. He would be replaced
with an older hand with a more powerful constituency. But
there are fewer such hints now.
   On the other hand, it can hardly be said that Mr. Kaifu is
throwing his weight around. He promised the Indian
legislators that Japan would never again aspire to military
power. Given Japan's brutal pre-1945 imperialism, such
promises are obligatory for Japanese leaders on state visits
in Asia. Given the catastrophe that militarism brought to
Japan itself -- not to mention the stricture against military
conquest written into its postwar constitution -- it is an
obligatory promise to the Japanese people as well. Because
Japan is viewed as a nation unwilling and unable to use
muscle, it is often counted out of the world's games of
Realpolitik.
   Mr. Kaifu did inject himself into the current
India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir by urging self-restraint,
a relatively bold intervention in a private dispute for a
Japanese prime minister. But his main message, that Japan
will use its economic and technological power to play a wider
role in world affairs, didn't carry much sex appeal. When
Japan says such things, it often is assumed that it is just
Japan conducting business as usual, offering Third World
countries aid as a means of gaining new trade relationships
and opportunities for direct investment.
   Indeed, the U.S. has put up some resistance -- not all of
it successful -- to Japan's proposals that it should become a
bigger factor in multilateral institutions, such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Japanese
argument is simple. Japan is the country that has the most
money. It has been arguing that it is prepared to offer
foreign aid that has no mercantilist strings attached. But
the U.S., fearful of what Japan might be able to do with all
the dollars it has piled up, remains suspicious of Japan's
ambitions for a larger role in the multilateral banks.
   Such attitudes in the U.S. no doubt helped provoke last
year's much publicized counterattack by Sony Chairman Akio
Morita and right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara, "The
Japan That Can Say `No.'" But some Japanese say the book gave
a misleading impression of a rise in anti-Americanism in
Japan. Polls indicate that the Japanese people welcomed the
market opening forced on the Japanese government by the U.S.
   Mr. Kaifu was willing to fly to California on short notice
some weeks ago to seal that bargain. Contrary to what some
observers expected, his popularity in Japan rose. Japan also
supported the U.S. in its unwillingness to allow the proposed
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to lend the
Soviet Union amounts in excess of its capital investment.
   More to the point, Japan is in no position to say no to
the U.S. even as it gains more muscle. To be sure, it has
been building its self-defense forces, expanding both its
navy and air force. With the help of U.S. air and naval
forces based in Japan, it now can apply significant military
power to the vital straits that adjoin the seas of Japan and
Okhotsk. Its defense budget is only about one-tenth that of
the U.S., but it is not very far below that of West Germany
and France.
   Yet Japan is well aware of the political dangers in its
part of the world. The major item on its foreign-policy
agenda has for years been its dispute with the Soviet Union
over four islands off Hokkaido that were awarded to the
Soviets at Yalta as a reward for their minimal role in
bringing about Japan's World War II surrender. The Japanese
have a historical claim to the islands and insist that they
will not establish normal relations with the Soviets until
the issue is settled. A much-discussed Gorbachev visit to
Japan has been the subject of political games within Japan
itself as well as with the Soviets. No firm date has
materialized.
   The Soviets, for their part, have become what Mikhail
Gorbachev chose to call a "Pacific power," with large air and
naval forces operating in the region. By U.S. estimates, this
includes two aircraft carriers, 77 major warships, 98
submarines and 1,300 tactical aircraft, not to mention
nuclear forces. Although the Soviets have made a big thing of
their scaling back of Asian forces, the Japanese are
convinced that this has mainly been the replacement of
obsolete equipment with more modern weapons, with an overall
improvement in the quality of forces.
   Because of its uneasy relations with the U.S.S.R., not to
mention other potential sources of trouble such as the
Koreas, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and China, Japan
values its military alliance with the U.S. It also values
U.S. efforts to develop and deploy a missile defense. Indeed,
Japan has some technologies, particularly in the area of
optical scanning and instrumentation, that could make a
contribution to the successful deployment of a spacebased
defense system that would protect not only the U.S. but its
allies as well.
   If the U.S. cuts its military forces in the Far East as
planned, the Japanese may have to play a bigger political
role in the region. It will be an unaccustomed role and not
one the Japanese particularly welcome. Mr. Kaifu was trying
to define its terms last week, but with limited success.
Perhaps it will become clearer in the months ahead.
