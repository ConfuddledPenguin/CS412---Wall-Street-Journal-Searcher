   AmeriFirst Bank said it hired Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. to
help raise capital for the bank and to develop plans to
enhance the value of its stock.
   Miami-based AmeriFirst said it will work with Kidder's
Financial Services Group, which specializes in transactions
for financial institutions, including restructurings and
recapitalizations.

   In April, AmeriFirst settled four shareholder lawsuits,
which had alleged that the bank had misled shareholders about
its financial condition in public filings. AmeriFirst said
the settlement was an essential step toward its objective of
raising new capital to meet regulatory requirements.
   Kidder is a unit of General Electric Co.
