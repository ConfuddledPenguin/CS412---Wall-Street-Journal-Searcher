   WASHINGTON -- Representatives of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries endorsed a 50% increase in the
resources of the International Monetary Fund and said that
the continued weakness of the yen "may have undesirable
consequences" for global economic adjustment.
   The endorsement of a 50% increase in IMF resources --
contained in a communique released last night -- makes it
likely that final agreement on the matter will be reached
today at meetings of the IMF's powerful policy-making Interim
Committee.

   Representatives of the world's most powerful economies,
who met here yesterday, also seem to have removed a major
obstacle to the increase in IMF resources, by organizing
among themselves a new ranking of the IMF's major
shareholders.
   Under the proposed reorganization, the U.S. would remain
the largest shareholder with slightly more than 19%; both
Japan and West Germany would rank second with equal shares of
slightly more than 6%. If two countries are ranked second
there wouldn't be a No.3-ranked holder. Britain and France
probably would rank fourth with equal shares of about 5.5%
each.
   "There's a broad range of understandings" although "the
arrangements aren't yet finalized," David Mulford, U.S.
Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said after
the G-7 meeting yesterday, which was held on Capitol Hill.
   Although unhappy about the continued weakness of the yen,
the G-7, which includes the finance ministers and central
bank presidents of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada, "noted with satisfaction the
recent stability in exchange markets and continued growth in
industrial countries."
   It also wasn't clear what the G-7 might do, if anything,
to boost the yen. When asked whether there might be concerted
intervention to shore up the Japanese currency, Mr. Mulford
said: "We never comment on operational matters."
   The Japanese themselves seem most concerned about the
yen's weakness. Japan's vice minister of finance, Makoto
Utsumi, stressed at a news conference after the G-7 meeting
that the yen's current level is a problem.
   Mr. Utsumi said that although stable, the yen's recent
value -- in a narrow range below 160 to the dollar -- remains
an obstacle to reducing imbalances. Central Bank Governor
Yasushi Mieno stressed that the G-7 made no agreement on a
specific appropriate level for the yen in the
foreign-exchange markets. But he said the group is clearly in
agreement that the yen should strengthen.
   The organization also expressed continued concern about
inflation, which recently has risen in some industrialized
countries. "Price pressures warrant continued vigilance," the
G-7 said in its communique.
   The G-7 also underscored its determination to resist trade
protectionism and emphasized that "a successful conclusion of
the Uruguay Round is essential for promoting an open and
growing world economy." That is the current round of
trade-liberalization talks being held under the international
trade treaty, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The current international debt strategy, which places more
reliance on cutting back bank debt and interest payments,
also drew renewed support from the G-7. But, in its
statement, the G-7 urged "a stronger emphasis in IMF and
World Bank programs on measures to attract new investment and
a return of flight capital." Critics have identified the
shortage of new investment capital as a weakness of the new
debt strategy.
   Flight capital is money held overseas by citizens of
debtor countries.
   Several points made in the G-7 communique released
yesterday followed those in the G-7's statement released in
Paris on April 7, when the group also stressed the
"undesirable consequences" of yen weakness.
   A weak yen tends to boost Japan's foreign sales, making it
harder for that country to reduce its large trade surplus.
The U.S. has run huge trade deficits with Japan in recent
years; last year's totaled $49 billion.
   The G-7 also, as it did in Paris, endorsed Germany's
expected unification. This process, it said, "would
contribute to improved non-inflationary global growth and a
reduction in external imbalances." It is widely expected that
the merging of the two Germanys will reduce West Germany's
huge trade surplus.
   The G-7 met yesterday prior to two days of half-yearly
meetings of the IMF and World Bank. A last-minute glitch at
tomorrow's Interim Committee meetings still could hold up the
increase in the IMF's resources. But most participants,
including IMF staff, are increasingly optimistic.
   A 50% increase in the IMF's resources would increase the
multilateral institution's current $120 billion of capital by
$60 billion for a total of $180 billion. The IMF's 152 member
countries finance the IMF by pledging reserves to the
institution in an exchange of assets.
   In a vigorous drive against continued delinquency on IMF
obligations by some countries, the U.S. is pressing for the
IMF to amend its articles to allow the organization to
suspend the membership of uncooperative and persistently
recalcitrant member countries.
   For that to happen, the IMF needs an 85% majority of its
voting membership to change its articles. The U.S. wants to
link a vote on the suspension issue to the IMF quota
increase.
   Nevertheless, the IMF's quota increase is likely to take
time to implement and may not be completed until late 1991.
In the past, increases in IMF's resources have taken as long
as two years to complete.
