   Arab Banking Corp. said it plans to offer 25 million
shares to international investors at about $15 apiece.
   Abdulla A. Saudi, president and chief executive officer of
the Arab world's largest bank, said that at $15 each, a price
close to the bank's estimated net asset, the offering would
raise $375 million before fees and expenses.

   Arab Banking is the first Gulf-based institution to offer
its shares to non-Arab investors.
   Arab Banking said it has invited international financial
institutions to underwrite the offering, which the bank will
use to finance expansion plans in Europe and the Arab world.
   Underwriting commitments totaling $235 million have been
received from Arab Banking holders and other financial
institutions, including the banks that will organize the
offering, Mr. Saudi said.
