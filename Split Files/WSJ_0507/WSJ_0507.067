   WARSAW -- With the Bush-Gorbachev summit only three weeks
away, U.S. officials are concerned that the Soviet leadership
has yet to develop a clear position on the major issues of
arms control and German unity.
   After two days of talks in West Germany with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, including the opening
of the six-power negotiations on German unity, Secretary of
State James Baker and his advisers were left with the
impression that Moscow is still wrestling with the issues.

   In the meetings, Mr. Shevardnadze continued to press the
tough positions that first emerged a month ago at a meeting
in Washington. But U.S. officials said there were hints from
the Soviet delegation that these stands aren't necessarily
the final word from Moscow. Mr. Shevardnadze bolstered this
view by going to great lengths in his public appearances to
play down the Soviet opposition to Western proposals.
   "I don't think we should dramatize," he said at a news
conference. "After all, this is quite a normal phenomenon
around a bargaining table."
   The uncertainty about Soviet intentions is frustrating to
Mr. Baker and his aides, who flew here yesterday to assure
Poland's leaders that the German unity talks will respond to
their worries about guaranteeing the German-Polish border.
   Mr. Baker and his aides believe that, until a few weeks
ago, they were closing in on a series of historic accords
that would seal the Soviet retreat from Eastern Europe,
remove major Soviet advantages in nuclear weapons and reunify
Germany on Western terms.
   Now, the secretary of state can't be certain whether he
will find any flexibility in Moscow next week when he flies
there for crucial pre-summit bargaining. "We won't know where
they really stand on things until we get to Moscow," said a
senior State Department official after the Baker-Shevardnadze
meeting. "It may not emerge until Gorbachev sits down at the
summit."
   Mr. Shevardnadze laid out an uncompromising position at
the first meeting of the "two-plus-four" talks in Bonn with
Mr. Baker and the foreign ministers of the two German states,
Britain and France. He told them that the Soviets couldn't
accept a unified Germany as a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization with unlimited armed forces. And he
rejected a Western push to bless German unity even before
such issues are resolved.
   Meeting privately with Mr. Baker, the Soviet official also
clung to Moscow's hard line on such arms-control issues as
cruise missiles.
   American officials concede they aren't sure why Moscow has
dug in its heels. They see a possibility that the change is a
late-inning bargaining maneuver or a reflection of the
paralysis in the Soviet leadership caused by the distractions
of the economic and ethnic crises in the U.S.S.R.
   A more pessimistic view that is gaining ground in the
administration is that Moscow may resist further compromises
until the end of an historic Communist Party congress set to
start July 2. The theory is that Mr. Gorbachev may be
unwilling to anger hard-line opponents before the congress
convenes. That would mean that agreements on arms, trade and
other matters, which were expected to be reached at the
summit, could be delayed.
   But the American officials still express confidence that
the Soviets will come around. On Germany, they believe,
Moscow will have to drop objections to unity because the two
Germanys are rapidly merging and the Soviets wouldn't want to
risk losing German economic ties by playing the spoiler.
   On arms control, the administration is pinning its hopes
on unspecified "new ideas" that it is offering the Soviets to
resolve the sticking points. And officials hope that
President Bush's recent decision to abandon new nuclear
weapons in Germany will give Mr. Gorbachev more maneuvering
room with his internal critics.
