   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. has
dissolved a joint venture that provided property/casualty
insurance for multinational corporations because it wasn't
successful in a highly competitive segment of the insurance
market.
   Aetna, a unit of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., and
Assicurazoni Generali S.p.A. of Trieste, Italy, each owned
45% of Aegen International Inc., which was formed in 1981.
Taisho Marine &amp; Fire Co. of Japan owned the remaining 10%.

   Aegen wrote just $10 million in net written premiums. It
faced huge competition from such larger, well established
insurers as American International Group Inc., Cigna Corp.
and Chubb Co.
   All three of the venture partners decided that each of
them individually will develop insurance coverages for
U.S.-based companies doing business abroad and for
foreign-based companies with U.S. ventures.
   The venture maintained 30 employees at New York's World
Trade Center, and they were told Friday that the company was
being disbanded.
   The Aetna/Generali International Benefits network, which
provides employee benefits for foreign employees of
multinational companies, is a separate entity and wasn't
affected by this change. Aegen was separate from Aetna's
international operations, which weren't affected by Friday's
actions.
