   TORONTO -- Weaker commodity prices and a slowing economy
drove Canadian corporate profits sharply lower in the first
quarter, prompting analysts to scale back their earnings
forecasts for the rest of the year.
   In a Wall Street Journal survey of 177 early reporting
companies, first-quarter earnings from operations totaled
1.86 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.59 billion), down 40%
from C$3.10 billion a year earlier. It was the third quarter
in a row that Canadian profits declined from year-earlier
levels.

   "You have to go back to the {recessions of the} early
1980s to see a similar period of pervasive weakness in
corporate profits. The pressures on profitability will
persist {although} the rate of decline may slow," said Aron
Gampel, a senior economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
   Like many Canadian economists, who earlier this year had
predicted moderate earnings growth for 1990, Mr. Gampel
expects after-tax profits to drop about 10% this year from
1989 before recovering in 1991 to show a gain of about 5%.
Meantime, Mr. Gampel predicts, Canada's annual growth in
gross domestic product, which measures total output of goods
and services, will decline to about 1% in both 1990 and 1991
from 2.9% last year.
   One reason for the gloomy outlook in 1990 is the Bank of
Canada's tight monetary policy, which has kept interest rates
at painfully high levels for longer than many private
economists had expected. Now, they say, stubborn inflationary
pressures in the economy, especially rising wage demands,
will probably mean continued high domestic rates perhaps for
another year.
   One result of Canada's high interest rates -- three-month
Canadian Treasury bills currently yield over five percentage
points more than comparable U.S. bills -- has been a strong
Canadian dollar. This depresses earnings of many Canadian
companies, especially exporting concerns, when revenues are
translated back into the local currency.
   In the first quarter, the Canadian dollar traded in a
range of 82.8 U.S. cents to 86.5 cents, compared with 83.2
cents to 84.8 cents a year earlier. The Canadian dollar
traded Friday around 86 cents.
   Forestry concerns were among the biggest decliners in the
first quarter, with 17 companies reporting profits from
operations of C$92.6 million, down 76% from a year earlier.
Raymond Kilroy, an analyst at Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.,
said the sector was hurt by persistent weakness in newsprint
prices and lower pulp shipments to correct an inventory
buildup. The analyst expects continued weak profits in the
second quarter. Later in the year, he says, newsprint prices
should firm, but "the industry is going to have to work
awfully hard to prevent {pulp} prices from slipping."
   Among 21 mining concerns, profits fell 65% to C$252
million, mainly because of a steep drop in the price of most
base metals. The average price of nickel on the London Metal
Exchange, for instance, more than halved to $3.52 a pound in
the first quarter from a year earlier, said Victor
Lazarovici, an analyst at BBN James Capel Inc. Metal prices,
which have rebounded in recent weeks, will probably
experience a customary weakening in the summer months before
improving in the fourth quarter, the analyst said.
   Inco Ltd., the Western world's largest nickel producer,
posted first-quarter profit of US$67.7 million, down 75% from
a year earlier. Noranda Inc., with interests in mining and
forestry, had profit of C$59 million, down 63%.
   Oil companies benefited from higher crude prices, but this
was offset among the integrated producers by weakness in
refining and marketing operations. Overall, 16 oil companies
reported earnings of C$360.2 million, little changed from a
year earlier.
   Shell Canada Ltd., a 78%-owned subsidiary of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, saw its profit drop 46% to C$63 million,
mainly because of lower results from its chemical and
oil-product businesses.
   Although Imperial Oil Ltd. reported a rise in net income
to C$150 million from C$113 million, a C$91 million gain from
the sale of properties in the latest period masked lower
results elsewhere. Last year's acquisition of Texaco Canada
Inc. raised Imperial's interest costs, and production at its
Syncrude oil-sands mining project was reduced by a fire in
December. Imperial is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp.
   In the manufacturing sector, 45 companies had
first-quarter profits of C$455 million, down 38% from a year
earlier. Steelmakers were among the biggest decliners because
of the high Canadian dollar and production cutbacks by the
automobile industry. Stelco showed a loss of C$13.3 million
after posting year-earlier profit of C$32.8 million. Dofasco
had earnings of C$10 million, compared with profit from
continuing operations of C$59.2 million.
   Alcan Aluminium Ltd., blaming lower prices and reduced
demand, saw its first-quarter earnings fall 36% to US$172
million.
   Northern Telecom Ltd. was one of the few gainers in the
first quarter, with profit up 50% to US$79.1 million, helped
by increased market share for its principal line, central
office switching equipment. NorTel Chairman Paul Stern
expects higher earnings for the full year, which, he said,
"is sort of amazing," in light of current economic
conditions.
