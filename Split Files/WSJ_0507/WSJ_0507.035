   SANAA, North Yemen -- North and South Yemen announced
Friday that their separate currencies will be accepted in
each country, starting immediately.
   The decision, adopted at a meeting of prime ministers
Abdel-Aziz Abdel-Ghani of the North and Yassine Saeed No'man
of the South, is part of the speedy steps the two countries
are taking as they move toward merger.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The merger, initially planned by the end of November, is
expected to be advanced by six months and proclaimed on May
26, when the parliamentary bodies of the two countries hold a
joint meeting in the South Yemeni capital of Aden.
   South Yemen's currency is the dinar, equivalent to 0.343
of a U.S. dollar, and North Yemen's is the rial, with 12
rials to the dollar.
