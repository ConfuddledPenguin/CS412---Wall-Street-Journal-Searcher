   Two top executives were fired from beleaguered Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Co. in a power struggle clearly won by Saatchi's new
chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
   Saatchi said Roy Warman and Terry Bannister, two Saatchi
veterans who served as joint chief executives of the
company's advertising operations, left on Friday. Their
departure followed a month-long struggle with Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus, who wanted to demote them from the parent
company and put them in its operating units. London-based
Saatchi owns Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, Backer Spielvogel
Bates and a number of smaller ad agencies in the U.S.

   A third corporate executive, group deputy chairman Jeremy
Sinclair, 43 years old, was given additional responsibility
for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. That agency,
like all of Saatchi's ad agencies, had reported to Mr. Warman
and Mr. Bannister. The other agencies for now will report
directly to Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, a Saatchi spokesman said.
   The departure of the two men is a victory for Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus, a French executive who was brought in January
to clean up troubled Saatchi. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus asserted
before he even started his job that he would have complete
control, but many in the industry doubted he could wrest
power from Saatchi's domineering founders, Charles and
Maurice Saatchi, and from their loyal cadre of top officers,
including Mr. Warman and Mr. Bannister.
   Mr. Warman, 42, joined Saatchi when it was a tiny,
year-old shop in 1971, and Mr. Bannister, 44, followed two
years later. Close friends of the Saatchis, they attempted to
persuade the brothers to support their side, say people close
to the company, but were disappointed. Their ouster marks the
first clear sign of the brothers deferring to Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus.
   In a statement, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus said, "I am sorry to see
them go, but following the decision to redeploy as much of
the central talent as possible within the operations, no role
could be found for Roy and Terry which satisfied them."
   Analysts believe Mr. Louis-Dreyfus may try to thin out
Saatchi's corporate staff -- which includes longtime Saatchi
cronies Mr. Sinclair and Simon Mellor, who oversees some U.K.
affiliates, among others -- even further. "I would be very
surprised if this is the last" step, said James Dougherty, an
analyst with County NatWest Securities. "I think he has in
mind clearing out the whole holding company structure. The
holding company overhead was way bigger than it needed to be
. . . and there was a coterie of advisers around the brothers
whose actual operating responsibilities were unclear."
   Saatchi insiders insist that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus didn't set
out to fire the two men, only to reassign them. The new chief
executive initially hoped to divide the Saatchi advertising
empire into three parts; one such configuration would have
encompassed Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, Backer Spielvogel,
and the group of smaller agencies, one executive said. Mr.
Warman and Mr. Bannister each would have headed up one of the
groups, while Mr. Sinclair, a close friend of Charles Saatchi
who has been with the company since its founding, would have
headed up the third.
   Mr. Warman and Mr. Bannister objected, however, since the
entire advertising operation already reported to them, and
since they wanted to continue working together as a team. The
impasse dragged on for a month, until Friday, when Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus called a board meeting at which the directors
voted to terminate Mr. Warman's and Mr. Bannister's
employment contracts. Neither Charles nor Maurice Saatchi
attended the meeting, according to one person present -- but
both voted against their old friends by proxy.
   In an interview, Mr. Bannister said he and Mr. Warman
suggested alternatives, but were rebuffed. "We made
recommendations to the board that meant we would have
relinquished significant responsibility," he said, adding
that they envisioned jointly heading a group of Saatchi
companies specializing in integrated communications -- a
group accounting for about 40% of Saatchi's advertising-group
revenue. But he said Mr. Louis-Dreyfus rejected that idea.
Mr. Warman and Mr. Louis-Dreyfus couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Mr. Warman and Mr. Bannister didn't resign as directors,
but aren't expected to remain on Saatchi's board. With their
departures, the board would be narrowed to eight members, and
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus would come that much closer to controlling
it -- an essential step if he is to assert his new
leadership. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus and two of his appointees would
account for three votes, while a possibly pivotal swing vote
would be Harvard marketing guru Theodore Levitt, who has
advised Saatchi for years but who was nominated to the board
by Mr. Louis-Dreyfus.
   The realignment also is clearly a way for Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus to cut down on Saatchi's costly corporate
overhead. Mr. Warman and Mr. Bannister had each been earning
about #345,000 ($566,835) a year before Saatchi's directors
voted themselves a 10% pay cut earlier this year. Each has a
five-year contract with almost four years left and could walk
away with more than #1 million. A spokesman said, however,
that the figure would be negotiated.
   The paring down is just one part of a massive effort on
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus's part to turn around Saatchi. The firm has
been trying for almost a year to unload its consulting
operations, which it bought in an effort to become a world
leader in consulting. The spokesman said negotiations with
Saatchi's largest consulting unit, Hay Group, which is trying
to arrange a management buy-out for about $90 million, are in
the final stages.
   Meanwhile, Messrs. Warman and Bannister are trying to
figure out what to do next. Mr. Bannister said their next
step isn't yet clear, although the two plan to continue
working together as a team, if possible. He said one
possibility would be for the two to buy an ad agency.

   McDonald's Sponsors Life
                                                                                                       

   McDonald's takes over as the sole sponsor of a Life
magazine special issue on children appearing on newsstands
today.
   The fast-food company bought all 32 ad pages in the issue,
and uses the space to show off a one-time-only campaign
photographed by 26 photojournalists. The campaign focuses on
warm and fuzzy community-service type shots. Ad agency Leo
Burnett, which began working on the campaign a year ago,
declined to comment on the cost of the huge project, but
industry executives believe the ad space alone cost about $2
million.
   "McDonald's is doing a lot of promotional price
advertising on TV," said Dara Altshuler, a Burnett account
executive on the project. "The idea was, let's show the side
of McDonald's that people aren't familiar with."
   The single-sponsored issue of Life is just the latest
attempt by Time Warner's magazine group, which has had
declining ad pages, to come up with different ways to attract
new advertisers.

   NUTS: Planters LifeSavers Co. is to kick off a $20 million

franchise.
