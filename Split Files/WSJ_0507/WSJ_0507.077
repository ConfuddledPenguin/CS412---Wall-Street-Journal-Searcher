   NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. made more
than $600 million in payments that may be recoverable under
bankruptcy law because the transactions occurred during the
three months immediately prior to the company's
bankruptcy-court filing.
   The payments were disclosed in the company's statement of
financial affairs, filed with the federal bankruptcy court in
Manhattan last week. The document also lists details of
millions of dollars owed to former employees who cashed in
their Drexel stock in the months before Drexel filed for
protection Feb. 13 under the federal Bankruptcy Code.

   The filing, released Friday, discloses that Drexel paid
loans and interest totaling $621.8 million during the three
months immediately prior to filing for bankruptcy-court
protection. Bankruptcy lawyers say such payments, with
certain exceptions, can be recovered if it is shown that a
company gave preference to some creditors and if the debtor
was insolvent at the time. Such money can then be
redistributed to creditors.
   Creditors' and shareholders' attorneys are using the
statement of financial affairs as a road map to possible
pockets of money to pay off Drexel's debts, according to
bankruptcy lawyers familiar with the case. Creditors also are
likely to examine the document for any payments to company
executives, which could be recoverable if such payments were
made within a year before the Chapter 11 filing and if the
company was insolvent at the time of the transaction.
   "The primary issue will be whether Drexel was insolvent,"
said Barry Dichter, a bankruptcy partner at Cadwalader,
Wickersham &amp; Taft, who represents the Central Bank of
Portugal, one of Drexel's largest creditors. "It's fair to
say that determining whether Drexel Burnham Lambert Group was
solvent or insolvent at the time of the transactions will be
one of the toughest solvency problems ever presented to a
bankruptcy court." He said the hardest task for those
involved in the proceedings will be to determine the value of
junk bonds held by Drexel.
   "Preferences are a litigation goldmine," added Hugh M.
Ray, a bankruptcy law attorney in Houston. Creditors'
attorneys "will want to know who got what and when, and who
knew what and when," he said.
   Alan Miller, an attorney for Drexel, said: "At no point
was {Drexel} insolvent." However, bankruptcy lawyers say the
debtor is presumed to have been insolvent during those three
months. If the Drexel creditors' committee or shareholders'
committee seek to recover such payments, it will be up to the
parties that were paid to prove that the company was solvent.
   The largest amount paid during the three-month period was
$248 million, received by Taiyo Mutual Life of Tokyo,
Drexel's biggest unsecured creditor. AmBase Corp.'s Home
Capital Services Inc. unit, Drexel's second-biggest unsecured
creditor, was paid $66.7 million. Bank of China, another
major unsecured creditor, was paid $40 million. Also,
Chemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank was paid $84 million
in loans and interest in January 1990.
   According to the filing, Michael Milken cashed in Drexel
stock with a book value of $62 million when the company
settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges last June.
Under the terms of that agreement, Mr. Milken, formerly head
of Drexel's junk-bond operation, was required to resign and
sell back his Drexel stake. His brother, Lowell Milken, also
resigned and was to be paid $8.9 million for his stock.
Neither has received any of the money, the filing said.
Drexel and the Milkens are still negotiating how much will be
paid for the stock. Recently, Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to
securities-law violations.
   As of March 30, Drexel said it had total assets of $3.26
billion and total liabilities of $2.8 billion. Drexel said
the assets include $1.5 billion in securities, much of it
junk bonds, which are high-yield, high-risk instruments.
   During the three months, Drexel also paid cash for
subordinated notes totaling $14.5 million to employees. The
company says it owes $19.9 million to employees who left
Drexel in the three months before the Chapter 11 filing and
cashed in their stock. Drexel employees are required to sell
back their stakes at book value when they leave the company.
But those who left during the three months have received
nothing for their stock. The largest amount -- $11.4 million
-- is owed to former Drexel president Joseph Vitanza, who
retired Dec. 31.
   The company's stock acquisitions from former employees
during the year before the bankruptcy filing had a book value
of $391 million. Under the company's payout schedule,
however, only a portion was initially paid; the rest is to be
paid out gradually, over 10 years in some cases.
   The list of stock transactions shows that the company
purchased $6.6 million in stock from Jon Burnham, a son of
Drexel's founder, when he left the company to join Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in April 1989. The stock purchase
from Haig Casparian, former in-house general counsel, was
$6.5 million when he left to go into private practice in
February 1989.
