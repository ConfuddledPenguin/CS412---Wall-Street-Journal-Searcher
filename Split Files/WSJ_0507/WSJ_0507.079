   PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted index of industrial
production fell 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 1989 from the
previous quarter but was up 3.2% from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Institute reported Friday.
   The state agency said the latest quarterly decline
followed a revised 0.6% advance in the third quarter. Prior
to Friday's revision, growth for the third quarter had been
reported as 0.4%.
