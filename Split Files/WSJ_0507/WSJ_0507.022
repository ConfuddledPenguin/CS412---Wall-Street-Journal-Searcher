   LOS ANGELES -- Robert A.G. Monks, a consultant to
institutional shareholders, said he didn't stand for
re-election to the board of Jefferies Group Inc. to avoid any
appearance of a conflict-of-interest.
   "Since I'm trying to advise people how to behave
themselves, I should set a good example myself," said Mr.
Monks, president of Washington-based Institutional
Shareholder Services Inc., which counsels clients on
corporate governance issues.

   Mr. Monks said he was criticized for his role in the
recent proxy fight between Lockheed Corp. and Dallas investor
Harold Simmons. Mr. Simmons retained Jefferies to solicit
proxies for his unsuccessful bid to nominate a rival slate of
directors, which Institutional Shareholders and Mr. Monks
supported.
   "Even though I wasn't profiting, {from the
Simmons-Jefferies relationship} there was the thought that I
was a director of a company that was profiting," Mr. Monks
said. There was also a question of whether Institutional
Shareholders' counsel to its clients was biased by the
relationship.
   Mr. Monks, 56 years old, was named to the Jefferies board
last year. His departure reduces the board's size to seven
members. Mr. Monks has agreed to head the brokerage firm's
strategic advisory committee, which will meet several times a
year. The position will be unpaid, he and Jefferies said.
