   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank and its affiliate, the
International Development Association, approved $455 million
in loans to India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
   India will get two loans, $235 million from the IDA and
$25 million from the World Bank, to improve the training of
engineers, technicians and other workers.

   In other actions, the IDA approved a $105 million credit
to Bangladesh for electric-power projects, primarily in rural
areas. Sri Lanka will get a $90 million IDA loan to help
stabilize its economy and support broad structural reforms.
   The IDA credits will be interest-free except for
administrative fees; the World Bank loan to India will carry
a variable interest rate, currently 7.75% a year.
