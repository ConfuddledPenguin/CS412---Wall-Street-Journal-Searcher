   BANGKOK, Thailand -- Thai Airways International may have
trouble keeping up with its ambitious expansion plans,
industry executives say.
   The national flag carrier's fleet is expected to increase
45% to 77 planes by 1995 from 53 planes currently, airline
officials said at a recent marketing conference here. But
executives at the conference said the pace of expansion may
make it difficult for the airline to maintain the quality of
its service and ground operations.

   The growth means coping with hiring and training thousands
of new employees, including hard-to-find mechanics and
pilots, and vastly expanding facilities for aircraft
maintenance and ground handling for passengers and cargo,
Thai International executives said.
   Responding to mounting growth in its passenger traffic,
Thai International plans to invest a total of at least 106
billion baht ($4.08 billion) by 1995, according to Udom
Krisnampok, an executive vice president at the airline. Nor
will fleet growth slow much after that, Mr. Udom said. By the
year 2000, Thai International will grow to 94 aircraft,
including 78 wide-bodied planes, he estimated.
   This year's annual conference was preoccupied with the
airline's acquisition plans through the fiscal year ending
Oct. 1, 1995, and how to finance and administer the growth.
   Mr. Udom said Thai International expects its passenger
traffic to grow an average of 11.7% annually, buoyed by
strong business and tourism growth in Thailand as well as
booming Asia-wide air travel.
   Airline officials say they expect profit to reach 27
billion baht ($1.04 billion)by 1995. In fiscal 1989, Thai
International posted a record pretax profit of 7.42 billion
baht ($285.4 million).
   But the airline faces plenty of problems, some of which
have nothing to do with its growth pains. Jothin
Pamon-Montri, vice president, ground operations, at Thai
International, told the conference that swelling
international traffic at airports all over the world means
inevitable delays unless steps are taken to unclog runways.
   Thai International and other airlines may be forced to
stagger takeoff-and-landing times to more inconvenient hours
-- perhaps into the middle of the night -- because of the
problems, he said. Overall traffic at Bangkok's Don Muang
International Airport increased almost 16% in the year ended
last Oct. 1, Thai International officials said.
   By 1995, Thai International's fleet will include 11 Boeing
Co.-747s and seven 737s of various models, four McDonnell
Douglas Corp. MD-11s, and 25 Airbus Industrie aircraft of
various models. It is also to include five additional as-yet
unspecified 400-seat aircraft, eight additional 300-seat
aircraft, and four additional 100-seat aircraft.
