   London shares closed mostly higher in light trading
Friday, as a better-than-expected performance by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in local
elections prompted a resurgence of market confidence.
   "It's just been a relief that the Conservatives didn't do
as badly as they were expected to do," said one trader.

   Prices gained on most other world markets. The Tokyo
exchange was closed for a holiday.
   At London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index finished up 27.3 points at 2162.2, its biggest gain in
more than a month. The index hit an intraday high of 2168 and
posted a low of 2146.4 at the opening of official trading.
   At the close, the FT 30-share index was up 20.2 points at
1696.8. Volume was 437.5 million shares, compared with 392.8
million Thursday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 stock-index
contract finished at 2189, up from 2166 Thursday.
   Some fresh buying, along with post-election short
covering, bolstered the market's upward momentum, dealers
said. Additionally, a shortage of stock in selected blue
chips helped to exaggerate share price movements somewhat,
they said.
   Expectations among dealers about the market's performance
this week are mixed, with some forecasting that it will hold
current levels and others anticipating that the pre-weekend
rally exhausted the market's upside potential for now.
   Dealers noted that the market's prospects for further
gains may be limited by investor jitters over U.K. inflation
data scheduled for release Friday and concerns that British
interest rates still haven't peaked.
   Privatization stocks were buoyed by the election results,
dealers noted, particularly as the market has been worried
about opinion polls showing growing popularity of the
anti-privatization Labour Party.
   British Gas rose 8 to 202; British Petroleum gained 7 1/2
to 320, and the package of 10 recently privatized water
authorities advanced 35 to #14.08 ($23.13).
   Banking stocks fared well as bears covered short
positions, traders said.
   Barclays jumped 13 to 533; Lloyds rose 14 to 272; Midland
gained 6 to 290; Standard Chartered rose 12 to 489 and
National Westminster added 14 to 333.
   The composite insurance sector was strong as well amid the
general market tone.
   Commercial Union rose 5 to 458; Guardian Royal Exchange
increased 5 to 224; General Accident added 23 to #10.31 and
Royal Insurance climbed 9 to 442.
   Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan. Prices ended mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks closed higher.
   Share prices closed higher in Seoul, Taipei, Singapore and
Wellington; lower in Sydney and little changed in Hong Kong
and Manila.
   In early trading in Tokyo, stocks advanced steadily. The
Nikkei index stood at 30,752.62 at midmorning, up 578.98
points from last Wednesday's close. The market was closed
Thursday and Friday for national holidays.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
