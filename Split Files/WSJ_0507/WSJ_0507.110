   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Costa Rica and a group of
U.S. banks signed an agreement Saturday restructuring the
Central American country's $1.8 billion commercial debt.
   The accord, which is expected to save Costa Rica $150
million a year, was signed by James Jardine of the Bank of
America, and Eduardo Lizano of the Costa Rican central bank.
Mr. Jardine acted as the representative of the creditor
banks.

   President Oscar Arias said the agreement removes one of
the main obstacles to his country's economic growth. Mr.
Lizano said earlier that under the agreement, Costa Rica will
buy 64% of its commercial debt at 16 cents on the dollar.
   Costa Rica will have until May 21 to pay $253 million to
bring itself up to date in payments and purchase the old
debt.
   Costa Rica was one of the earliest countries to reach
agreement in principle on new financing packages under a U.S.
plan unveiled in March 1989 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady.
   It focuses on enticing commercial banks to write off some
of their loans to Third World nations or reduce the interest
charged in return for guarantees that the remaining debt will
be paid.
