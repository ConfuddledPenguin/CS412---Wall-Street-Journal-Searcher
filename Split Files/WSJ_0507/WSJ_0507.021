   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. -- Detrex Corp. adopted a shareholders
rights plan to protect the company against "hostile
acquirers."
   Preferred-stock purchase rights will be distributed as a
dividend at the rate of one right for each share of common
stock held May 15, the company said. Each right will entitle
shareholders to buy 1/100th of a newly issued share of Series
A preferred stock of Detrex at an exercise price of $80, if
someone acquires more than a 15% stake in the company.
