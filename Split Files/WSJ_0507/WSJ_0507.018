   Molex Inc. has Asia wired.
   It manufactures electronic connectors in so many countries
throughout the region that the Lisle, Ill.-based company
could easily be mistaken for an Asian multinational.

   "I don't know where growth in the Far East has put such a
mark on an American company," says Stephen Balog, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   Stressing local managers' autonomy and a long-term
commitment, closely held Molex has expanded rapidly in Asia
to become the No. 3 connector maker in the world. A rarity
among U.S. companies, Molex conducts more business overseas
than it does at home. Asia accounts for 60% of the firm's
world-wide business. Its Japan sales alone exceed revenue in
the U.S.
   Molex's expansion offers a history lesson in the
development of electronics manufacturing in Asia during the
past two decades. From its first overseas investment, a
Japanese joint venture in 1970, the company has followed
manufacturers into Singapore and Taiwan in the late 1970s,
South Korea in the mid-1980s and Thailand last year. Along
the way it has also set up shop in Malaysia, Hong Kong, India
and China.
   "What really makes this Far East operation stand out is
that they spread themselves out rather than focusing on just
Japan," says Pamela Shore, an analyst with Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   Molex's success rests on anticipating the region's
manufacturing trends. The company started production in Tokyo
after it recognized that Japanese televisions -- products
that incorporate connectors -- were beginning to appear in
large numbers on the world market. As Japanese and other
multinationals sought lower-cost sites in Taiwan and
Singapore, Molex rushed to provide local service. And as
these same manufacturers sweep into the latest low-cost
countries of Thailand, Malaysia and China, Molex's plants
await them.
   "Molex saw ahead that production would shift out of
Japan," says Ms. Shore. "It chose to go to other areas and
was there when the shift occurred."
   By penetrating broadly into the $1.2 billion Asian market,
Molex has positioned itself to benefit from the industry's
continued strength in the region. Fleck International Inc., a
market research firm in Huntington Beach, Calif., predicts
that connector sales in Asia will outpace those in all other
regions of the world. The research firm expects the industry
to expand 9% in Asia this year compared with 3% in Japan and
negative growth in the U.S. During the next five years,
Asia's growth is seen hitting 8.3%, while Japan hovers at
around 6.4% and North America at 6.1%.
   The $15 billion connector industry isn't as glamorous as
fields immersed in cutting-edge technology. As the name
suggests, connectors join electronic components in such
products as videocassettes, personal computers and cars. They
may connect a printer to a personal computer, or circuit
boards within the computer, and can cost anywhere from 20
cents to $5,000. Their sophistication matches the needs of
the host product. For example, as technology miniaturizes
computer components, the connector industry must keep pace by
providing ever smaller devices.
   Despite the nuts-and-bolts image, connectors have a
history as long and rich as electronics itself. From their
first industrial applications in mines and motors in the
early decades of the century, connectors went on to play an
essential bit part in the sound equipment for the first
talking motion picture. In the 1930s, they flew aboard
Douglas Aircraft DC-1s and aided the growth of radio. During
the war, they helped facilitate communications and afterward
found their way into nearly every imaginable electronic
consumer product. Now they are being adapted for use in
high-definition televisions and the space shuttle.
   Molex, which was founded by John Krehbiel Sr. in 1938 as a
manufacturer of plastic consumer products, began supply ing
connectors for home appliances in 1946. Mr. Krehbiel is still
chairman, but day-to-day operations are now largely in the
hands of his two sons, John Jr. and Frederick. The company
remains a closely held public entity, with the family owning
a 47% share.
   Under Frederick's direction, the company pushed somewhat
blindly into the Japanese market two decades ago. "We were
frankly too naive and stupid to think we couldn't be
successful, and off we went," says Mr. Krehbiel, chief
executive officer.
