   NEW YORK -- The fourth weekly episode of the ABC series
"Twin Peaks" drew 19% of the TV audience, improving its
chances of joining ABC's fall schedule.
   The seven-week trial series, co-created by film director
David Lynch, has become a barometer of ABC's turnaround
efforts and of the networks' willingness to gamble on
"different" shows. "Twin Peaks" started strong and then
faltered, raising doubts about whether ABC, owned by Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., would pick up the series.

   ABC Entertainment President Robert Iger said the latest
rating "was the most significant number we've had. It's very
positive, and it bodes well in terms of the future of the
program." "Twin Peaks" in four weeks has fared well among two
key targets for advertisers, drawing 24% of women ages 18 to
34 and 28% of women ages 35 to 49 who were watching
television when it aired.
   The series, about sordid secrets in a small town, has
fared better than any of 14 shows to inhabit its time slot
since 1985, said Lawrence Hyams, ABC's director of audience
analysis. "Twin Peaks" increased its audience share from the
previous week despite airing in a tough time slot, opposite
NBC's hit comedy, "Cheers," which won 33% of viewers last
week.
