   WASHINGTON -- This capital city has its own graduate
school of influence-peddling. It's called The Washington
Campus.
   Its "students" are corporate executives who pay from
$1,300 to $2,500 apiece to be made Washington-wise in
two-to-six-day seminars. The "faculty" consists of well-known
lobbyists, members of Congress, their current and former
staff members, and pundits of both the academic and
journalistic variety. They are paid in that prized Washington
currency known as honoraria.

   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), for one, has earned
$90,000 in honoraria over the past five years from The
Washington Campus. He is a faculty regular and receives a
$1,000 honorarium for a 45-minute talk on Congress and the
life of a legislator. He gave this same basic speech 22 times
last year.
   Mr. Riegle doesn't have to go far to teach because,
despite its bucolic name, The Washington Campus is all
Washington and no campus. Congressional offices, hotel
meeting rooms and club anterooms double as ad-hoc classrooms.
   He also doesn't have to disclose the different corporate
interests that attend his lectures. Mr. Riegle has a policy
of not accepting honoraria from corporations that fall under
his purview as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. But
the senator pocketed a $1,000 honorarium from The Washington
Campus in March for talking to a group of executives from
Citicorp. Mr. Riegle has also been paid to participate in
Washington Campus programs for John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., which also have
an interest in legislation before the banking panel.
   "He enjoys teaching the governmental process," says
Karolyn Wallace, an aide to Sen. Riegle. She contends her
boss's Washington Campus fees are in line with his
no-honoraria-from-banking-interests policy, because he gives
the same speech each time and doesn't tailor his remarks to
fit any particular audience. Mr. Riegle did doctoral work at
Harvard Business School and has some university-level
teaching experience.
   More and more lawmakers and Washington pundits are hopping
on the academic gravy train, taking advantage of a
proliferation of high-priced seminars on how Washington
works. Some are run by such think tanks as the Brookings
Institution. Others are sponsored by universities,
inside-the-beltway publications and pundits themselves,
including columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) even sponsors his own
program, called the Wirth Washington Seminar. In late April,
300 Coloradans ponied up $250 a head (including a hotel room)
for a three-day program of speakers, including Sen. Bill
Bradley (D., N.J.), Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), Sen.
William Cohen (R., Maine), White House economic adviser
Michael Boskin and other big Washington names. Mr. Wirth's
clout is such that he doesn't even have to offer his speakers
honoraria.
   Stricter ethics rules passed by Congress last year have
only enhanced the popularity of such programs as The
Washington Campus. Beginning next year, House members can't
accept honoraria for speeches to corporations, trade
associations or other interest groups, but they can apply for
waivers for teaching income. The Senate has two bills pending
that would also ban honoraria.
   Sen. Riegle's former staff chief, Kevin Gottlieb, also
lectures frequently to Washington Campus corporate groups and
has earned hefty lecture fees. Controversy over Mr.
Gottlieb's high outside earnings, as well as questions about
his and his boss's ties to savings-and-loan executive Charles
Keating, presaged his departure as staff director of the
Banking Committee earlier this year. Mr. Riegle is one of
five senators facing a pending Ethics Committee inquiry into
the Keating affair.
   Last week, Mr. Gottlieb gave the opening lecture on the
role of Congress to the group from United Technologies Corp.
In 2 1/2 days, the United Technologies executives also heard
from lobbyist Tom Korologos; Rep. Nancy Johnson (R., Conn.);
Joseph Crapa, a top staffer of the House Appropriations
Committee; Stephen Bell, a former staff director of the
Senate Budget Committee; and an assortment of other political
and regulatory experts. They also met with United
Technologies' team of Washington lobbyists. Mel Elfin, an
editor at U.S. News &amp; World Report, led a session on the
press.
   Antoinette Pace Durkin, a former scheduler for the 1984
Mondale presidential campaign and executive director of The
Washington Campus, says the seminars offer the business world
an opportunity to see up-close "how the process works." This
year, The Washington Campus expects to run seminars for 30
different corporate groups.
   The United Technologies sessions, on which a Wall Street
Journal reporter was permitted to sit in, were mostly
condensed versions of basic political-science courses, with
some conventional inside-the-beltway wisdom and jargon thrown
in, along with some of the rudiments of lobbying. The eight
United Technologies executives, whose crash Washington
education cost their company at least $11,000, all seemed to
think they got their money's worth, although one confided
that by the end he had an even dimmer view of Washington than
he had before coming to The Washington Campus.
   "The purpose isn't to turn these people into instant
lobbyists. It's to shed light on their understanding of how
the process works," says Jim Lindse, who works in the
company's Washington office. United Technologies has sent 22
different groups to The Washington Campus since 1985.
   Ms. Durkin says the money made from the executive programs
is used to fund summer fellowships when real M.B.A. students
come to The Washington Campus for two-month sessions.
   The Washington Campus was founded in 1978 by William
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
After working as an economic adviser in the Ford White House,
Mr. Seidman says, "It impressed me that the system would work
better if executives had some idea how Washington worked." He
approached several business schools about launching a joint
program in Washington, but says they didn't have the
necessary funds.
   So Mr. Seidman and his wife successfully approached more
than 40 companies and foundations, including International
Business Machines Corp., BankAmerica Corp. and the Lilly
Endowment. Eventually, 16 business schools signed on to
sponsor the summer program, including Cornell and Dartmouth.
Some colleagues from the Ford White House, including Sidney
Jones and Roger Porter, joined Mr. Seidman on the faculty.
   Like Mr. Seidman, Mr. Jones and Mr. Porter are
high-ranking officials in the Bush administration, Mr. Jones
at the Treasury, Mr. Porter in the White House. They still
occasionally lecture to Washington Campus groups, although
executive-branch officials can't be paid for such speaking.
Mr. Seidman says he isn't active in the program anymore; The
Washington Campus lists him as an honorary member of its
board. Mrs. Seidman is on the board.
   Other insiders, including lobbyist and former White House
aide Anne Wexler; former Treasury official and lobbyist
Charls Walker; and David Gergen, a former communications
adviser to President Reagan and editor-at-large of U.S. News
&amp; World Report, are also on the board and faculty of The
Washington Campus.
   Most of the Washington Campus regulars say they
participate because they enjoy teaching, not for the money.
Mr. Korologos, for one, says he puts his Washington Campus
honoraria and other speaking fees into a special kitty that
he draws on for making political contributions. "I use it as
my nest egg to pay my way into the fundraisers," says Mr.
Korologos. "But it isn't enough."
