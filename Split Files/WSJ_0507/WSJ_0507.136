   The French nuclear energy group Framatome S.A. said profit
fell by 30% in 1989 but is expected to show a significant
rebound this year.
   Framatome said the drop in its group profit to 742 million
francs ($131.4 million) from 1.06 billion francs in 1988
reflected the fact that it received payment for only one new
nuclear reactor during the year, down from three in 1988.

   Group revenue rose to 19.9 billion francs from 10.8
billion over the same period, but Framatome noted that this
gain reflected the billing of a Superphenix generator that
hasn't yet had any impact on its profits.
   Looking ahead, Framatome said that "results for the year
1990 should show a significant improvement with the billing
of three new nuclear reactors and the favorable evolution of
profits from connecting rods activities." It didn't
elaborate.
   Framatome is controlled by the French government and
doesn't have any publicly traded voting securities.
