   WASHINGTON -- Do the words "Group of Seven" hit you like a
double dose of Sominex on a warm summer's night? Well, you're
not alone. Some of the group's leaders seem to feel the same
way.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, for one, has never
really taken to the international forum, which his
predecessor, James Baker, founded to coordinate international
economic policies. Mr. Brady prefers attending to domestic
problems, such as financial-market reform or the savings and
loan crisis.

   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel is likewise
preoccupied with problems at home, preparing for his nation's
monetary union with the East. And Japanese Finance Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto didn't even bother to show for yesterday's
G-7 meeting in Washington. A finance official in Tokyo said
the minister had more compelling business -- the Japanese
budget.
                                                                                                       

   As a result, international economic coordination is
faltering. Mr. Hashimoto made a lame attempt to revive the
process at last month's G-7 meeting, with a package of
proposals to support the yen. But they were roundly rejected
by West Germany and the U.S., and Mr. Hashimoto went home
empty-handed.
                                                                                                       

   Yesterday's agenda was far less ambitious; the ministers
were due to spend most of the time discussing a capital
increase for the International Monetary Fund. "I worry that
it {the G-7} could flounder," Federal Reserve Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said recently. "It needs some energy."
   As the G-7 stumbles, a growing chorus of commentators is
rooting for its demise. They blame the group for pressuring
countries to pursue inflationary policies, particularly after
the October 1987 stock-market crash. Yoshio Suzuki, former
executive director of the Bank of Japan, is one of the
naysayers. In a speech in London last February, he blasted
the G-7's efforts, saying that "if it had not been for the
international coordination, the stability of the domestic
macroeconomies of major countries since 1988 would have been
better."
                                                                                                       

   But to let the group die could prove costly. Mr. Suzuki
acknowledges the G-7 played an important role in calming the
financial turmoil that shook the world in the mid-1980s. And
a look around the world today suggests similar upheavals may
lie ahead.
                                                                                                       

   Here's the problem: The global pool of savings is getting
shallow. The super-high Japanese savings rates that helped
finance growth in the 1980s are slowly shrinking, and other
countries are seeing declines in savings as well. "The
savings rate in virtually every country, other than the
United States, is lower today than it was five years ago,"
says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International. And in the U.S., it remains near historic
lows.
   At the same time, demands on that pool of savings are
growing steadily. The big event for global finance will occur
on July 2, when East German marks will be traded for West
German marks mostly at a one-for-one rate. That's great for
East German consumers, whose purchasing power will quadruple.
But it will be a heavy blow to East German companies, which
will have to prove they can pay wages and interest in West
German currency. Many of the East's industrial dinosaurs will
undoubtedly fail, default on loans to the central bank and
leave the West with massive budget liabilities that could
rival the U.S. deficits.
   In Germany, says Kemper Financial Services economist David
Hale, "we're getting a dose of Reaganomics." That will be a
huge drain on the world's savings pool.
   And as for U.S. budget deficits, where are they headed?
Down, in the official figures. But up, if you include the
soaring costs of the S&amp;L bailout. The Treasury this week is
holding the biggest fund-raiser in its history -- a $30.5
billion refinancing -- to help pay that huge bill, draining
still more from the global savings pool. (Some, but not all,
of the money borrowed for the bailout is likely to find its
way back into the savings pool, as the government pays off
depositors and they put the money back into a bank.)
   The result could be a shortage of capital and a surge in
interest rates. In anticipation, rates on long-term bonds
have already risen a full percentage point in recent weeks.
And the administration is worried they could rise further.
That's one reason the White House pushed for yesterday's
unusual Sunday budget meeting with congressional leaders at
the White House. As Budget Director Richard Darman said in a
speech last week: "There is, at some point, a limit to how
much debt our capital markets can absorb on a reasonable
basis."
                                                                                                       

   What can the G-7 do about all of this? For starters, its
mere existence may keep financial markets from overreacting
to global changes -- as they did in the mid-1980s, when the
dollar soared to unrealistic heights. Financial markets are
like unruly schoolchildren and welcome even figurehead
authority.
                                                                                                       

   In addition, the G-7 needs to do what it can to reduce
government borrowing and expand the world pool of savings.
"It has to go beyond monetary coordination," says Mr. Hale,
"and cover fiscal policy as well." That will be difficult.
The U.S. remains impervious to G-7 calls to cut its budget
deficit. And Germany is unlikely to change its plans for
monetary unification to suit the G-7.
   Nevertheless, veterans of the process say the global group
can, at times, exert surprising peer pressure on its members.
It can often push policies in the right direction and prevent
mistakes. "It's like the board of directors of the world
economy," Mr. Hormats says. "In normal times, it may not do
much. But in unusual times, it has tough decisions to make."
The next few years may, in fact, be such times.
