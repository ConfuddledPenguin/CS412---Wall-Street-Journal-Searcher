   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Talley Industries Inc. said it retained
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. for advice on asset sales and other
steps to reduce Talley's debt burden.
   Talley Chairman William H. Mallender said his goal is to
cut the company's debt in half during the next two years
through a combination of selling some of Talley's 14
operating companies and reducing real-estate holdings.

   The move isn't triggered by any immediate financial
pressures or deadlines facing the company, said a company
spokesman. "We're trying to be prudent . . . in anticipation
of future maturities becoming more difficult to refinance."
   In a statement, Mr. Mallender said, "Turmoil in the debt
market world-wide makes it incumbent on the company to reduce
its dependence on debt financing." Talley's debt-to-equity
ratio is 2.2-to-1. At Dec. 31, total debt was $341 million,
including $27 million related to liabilities of the company's
savings banks. Talley had $153 million in equity.
   The spokesman said the Arizona real-estate depression is a
"factor" in the planned "restructuring," but didn't prompt
it. Last year, the company established a $36.6 million pretax
reserve related to its real-estate holdings.
   "We want to be able to wait and sell at the proper price,
and not take a fire-sale approach," the spokesman said. Of
the company's total assets of $1.09 billion at Dec. 31, $229
million were in real estate, mostly raw land in the Phoenix
area.
   Phoenix Metro Investors, a partnership that owns Talley's
corporate office building in Phoenix, sought bankruptcy-law
protection a few weeks ago, the spokesman said. Talley is the
managing partner. The move "is a reflection of what's
happening in the metro area and declines in real-estate
values," he said. "It's an unfortunate situation; we have an
investment in it, but it doesn't have any value on our
books."
   Talley said it is considering the sale of certain
operating companies, which it didn't identify, from its
industrial-products, specialty-products and savings-banks
segments. The concern plans to retain its holdings in two
other segments: real estate and government products and
services.
   Talley said it is reducing working capital programs,
capital expenditures and operating expenses. There will be
some "minor" personnel cuts, mostly from the corporate
office, the spokesman said. Talley has about 4,000 employees.
   In the first quarter, Talley had net income of $2.5
million, or 21 cents a share, about level with the
year-earlier quarter. Analysts expect income before special
items to be flat for the year, the spokesman said. In 1989,
Talley had net of $25.9 million, or $2.08 a share, which
included a $37.5 million gain from the sale of certain
operations and a charge of $24.2 million from the provision
on realty assets. Revenue was $421.1 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Talley was unchanged at $9 a share. The company's statement
was released after the close of trading.
