   ORLANDO, Fla. -- General Motors Corp. has agreed to manage
and engineer an $8 million Intelligent Vehicle/Highway System
project.
   The Orlando Smart Car project is jointly funded by GM, the
Federal Highway Administration, the Florida Department of
Transportation and the American Automobile Association. The
project will provide navigation assistance, real-time traffic
information, route selection and other information for
tourists and business travelers in the Orlando area.
Operations are planned for early 1992.

   The project should disclose the feasibility of such a
system, user acceptance and possible reduction in travel
times. Other areas to be studied include increased safety,
fuel savings and improvements in air quality.
   This project is similar to the $1.6 million Project Path
Finder that involves GM, the California Department of
Transportation and the Federal Highway Adminstration. It will
begin in a few months.
