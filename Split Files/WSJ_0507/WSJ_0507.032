   STOCKHOLM -- Norway's minority government outlined a
sweeping overhaul of personal income and corporate taxation
to bring the country's tax codes in line more with those of
other industrial nations.
   Finance Ministry officials said the proposals, submitted
to the Storting, or parliament, as a so-called white paper,
are modeled on tax reform adopted by the U.S. and U.K. during
the mid-1980s. Nominal tax rates would be slashed for both
individuals and companies, but the revenue base broadened
through elimination of many current deductions and other
loopholes.

   The government was intentionally vague about future tax
rates, pending upcoming hearings by Parliament. But the top
rate for personal taxation likely would decline to between
45% and 50% from 59% currently, government officials
suggested.
   Norway's corporate tax could be halved from the current
50.8%, but the actual change in companies' tax bills would be
far less drastic. Generous deductions under the present
system ensure that virtually no Norwegian company pays the
official tax rate.
