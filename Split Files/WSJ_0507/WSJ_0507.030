   WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden said that any congressional testimony by
Michael Milken before the former financier's legal settlement
becomes final could introduce "complications into the case."
   Last week, a House subcommittee voted to offer immunity to
the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. head of junk-bond
operations in return for his testimony. A spokesman for Mr.
Milken has said the financier would testify before Congress
if he is granted immunity. The vote now goes to the full
House Energy and Commerce Committee.

   But at a news briefing, Mr. Breeden said, "If you had
immunized testimony before . . . the plea agreement becomes
irrevocable on the day of the settlement, it does create the
potential for introducing complications into the case."
   He also said that the agency would "work with Congress to
make sure they understand the status of the case." He didn't
elaborate.
   Mr. Milken, whose settlement is scheduled to become final
on Oct. 1, pleaded guilty to six violations of federal
securities laws and agreed to pay penalties and restitution
of $600 million.
   Separately, SEC enforcement chief William McLucas said he
doesn't expect completed settlements to be reopened in the
wake of a U.S. appeals court ruling that overturned the
insider-trading conviction of former Gruntal &amp; Co. broker
Robert Chestman. That decision last Wednesday attacked the
underpinnings of many SEC insider-trading cases.
   "You make a settlement and you live with it," Mr. McLucas
said, adding that the agency is "not happy" with the
decision. Chairman Breeden declined to say whether the agency
would appeal.
   Mr. Breeden also said he will tell the Senate Agriculture
Committee tomorrow that he supports a three-pronged strategy
for changing the "very real problems" of split regulation in
the stock and futures markets. The SEC regulates stocks and
options and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees
stock-index futures, a hedging product that allows investors
to bet on the movement of a basket of stocks without buying
the actual shares.
   Mr. Breeden said he will support switching stock-index
futures to the SEC's purview. In addition, he proposed
putting a single government agency in charge of both stock
and futures margins, or the good faith money needed to make a
trade; currently, the Federal Reserve sets margin
requirements for stock, and commodity exchanges set them for
futures.
   The SEC chairman also said he favors ending a provision in
the Commodity Exchange Act that allows products with futures
elements to be traded only on futures exchanges.
