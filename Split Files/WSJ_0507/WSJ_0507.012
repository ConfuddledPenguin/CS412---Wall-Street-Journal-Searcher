   Michael R. Goland, a leading donor to pro-Israel political
causes, has been convicted of using $120,000 in illegal
campaign contributions in an attempt to sabotage the
candidacy of a Republican Senate hopeful in California in
1986.
   Mr. Goland, 42 years old, a self-made millionaire who
spent millions in his political ventures, now faces the
possibility of a fine of as much as $360,000 and the prospect
of becoming the first person in recent history to go to jail
for evading federal campaign spending limits in a Senate
race. The crime, a misdemeanor, carries a penalty of up to a
year in jail.

   The case ended with a bizarre twist on Thursday as a judge
in federal district court in Los Angeles ordered one of the
12 jurors who sat on the case to be removed from the jury,
just before it rendered its verdict. According to one of Mr.
Goland's attorneys, the juror, Barry Kuhnke, passed a note to
Mr. Goland in a parking lot outside the courthouse last
Wednesday. The note, as described in court here on Thursday,
told Mr. Goland the jury was deeply split and could be hung
on all six counts against Mr. Goland.
   "I can make it happen," said the note. After Mr. Kuhnke
was removed from the jury, the 11 remaining jurors agreed to
convict Mr. Goland on only one count. Mr. Newhouse said he
couldn't comment about whether charges might be brought
against the juror. Mr. Kuhnke couldn't be reached for
comment.
   An earlier trial against Mr. Goland ended in a mistrial
when the jury reported that one of its members, a woman,
refused to attend deliberations because she heard "voices"
that told her Mr. Goland was innocent.
   Nathan Lewin, Mr. Goland's attorney, denied that his
client had any intentional role in the alleged note-passing
episode and pointed out that Mr. Goland reported the incident
and turned the note over to federal prosecutors. "It's the
juror's conduct that is being investigated." Overall, he
said, he felt the mild verdict was "substantially an
acquittal."
   Mr. Newhouse, the federal prosecutor, said that "in view
of the seriousness of the crime we will be seeking the
maximum fine and a jail term."
   According to testimony in the case, Mr. Goland used a
former Republican National Committee staff worker and an
anti-abortion lobbyist in an underground campaign to
discredit the conservative credentials of former U.S. Rep. Ed
Zschau, who lost a tight race to Democratic Sen. Alan
Cranston, one of the Senate's staunchest supporters of aid to
Israel.
   Witnesses, including employees of Mr. Goland's Balboa
Construction Co., told the court how Mr. Goland funneled his
company's money through business acquaintances and a
Pro-Israel political action committee. The recipients
included an ultra-right, anti-Zionist, third-party candidate
Edward B. Vallen, who drew votes from Mr. Zschau. Mr. Zschau
lost the race by 116,000 votes, a tiny margin in California.
   Colleen Morrow, then a 22-year-old former staff member of
the Republican National Committee, testified that Mr. Goland
arranged a cover position for her as a "realty analyst" at
his company, which builds and leases small storage units.
   Mr. Goland, Ms. Morrow said, wrote the script and paid for
a television commercial used by the third-party candidate,
Edward B. Vallen, in a media blitz in Southern California
during the final days of the race. "There are two candidates
with integrity in this campaign: myself, who represents
Republicans and the true conservatives, and Alan Cranston,"
Mr. Vallen said in the commercial.
   Peter R. Gemma Jr., then executive director of the now
defunct National Pro-Life Political Action Committee, said he
sponsored newspaper advertisements and a direct-mail campaign
in conservative Orange County attacking Mr. Zschau's stand on
abortion-advertisements that were really paid for by Mr.
Goland.
   "I should say it's the same deal we had in Illinois," he
added, referring to an independent campaign Mr. Goland staged
against former Sen. Charles Percy in Illinois in 1984. Mr.
Goland later boasted he had spent over $1 million to defeat
Sen. Percy and was later fined $5,000 by the Federal Election
Commission for failing to identify himself as the sponsor of
a television commercial attacking Mr. Percy. Mr. Gemma said
he also ran advertisements in that campaign.
   "I assume that people I got money from came from Goland,"
says Mr. Gemma, currently a Washington political consultant,
who estimates the anti-Zschau effort cost $30,000.
   FEC rules, which prohibit a person from donating more than
$1,000 to a political campaign, weren't an obstacle for Mr.
Goland, according to David Hultquist, a former operating
officer for Balboa. He said he and other people connected
with the business were asked by Mr. Goland to make donations
to Mr. Vallen, and were, in turn, reimbursed by Mr. Goland.
   Mr. Hultquist and Carolyn Sandler, Mr. Goland's secretary,
said Mr. Goland spent most of his day talking politics on the
telephone with various operatives in Washington and
California. Meanwhile, they said, Balboa, which was heavily
in debt, was going speedily downhill. "The company literally
fell apart," said Mrs. Sandler.
   Despite his fine from the FEC for the 1984 infraction, Mr.
Goland's telephone logs, introduced into evidence, show he
was still popular with some Senators and House members during
1986. His most frequent conversations were with Sen. Cranston
and his aides. They have asserted that they were unaware of
Mr. Goland's dealings with Mr. Vallen.
   Ms. Morrow testified that Mr. Goland bragged that during a
1985 vote on an arms sale to Saudi Arabia, he threatened
several senators in the Senate cloak room by telling them:
"If you vote for this arms deal, I will do to you what I did
to Charles Percy in 1984."
   Mr. Goland's telephone records show that during the height
of the Cranston-Zschau race he was in almost daily contact
with officials of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee, a Washington-based group that lobbies on behalf of
Israel. A spokesman for AIPAC says the group has severed all
ties with Mr. Goland, once its biggest contributor.
   Mr. Goland took the stand to deny any wrongdoing,
complaining he was betrayed by aides who ignored campaign
laws. "Why would a respected philanthropist, who has given
away many millions of dollars for society's good, commit
criminal acts?" Mr. Lewin asked the jury.

   MICHAEL R. GOLAND, a businessman and donor to pro-Israel
political causes, didn't produce telephone logs showing he
was in almost daily contact with the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee during the 1986 Cranston-Zschau Senate race
in California, as stated in Monday's edition, although the
logs reflect at least four such telephone contacts. Last
week, a federal district court jury in Los Angeles, while
convicting him on one count of an election-law violation,
also acquitted him on four counts and was deadlocked on a
fifth. Monday's edition failed specifically to mention the
acquittals.
