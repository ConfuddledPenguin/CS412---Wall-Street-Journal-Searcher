   I appreciated the article "In Africa, Independence Is Far
Cry From Freedom" by George B.N. Ayittey (editorial page,
March 28). However, the emotional "bleeding heart" hype in
"Troubled Township: South Africa Blacks Speak Freely Now, and
Pressure Pretoria" (page one, April 4) perpetuates the myth
that the Afrikaners and apartheid are the cause of all
social, economic and political discrepancies in Southern
Africa. It was nauseating.
   The world community, and the U.S., has to come to grips
with the phenomenon and effects of international "apartheid"
so that we can, one day, deal more effectively and sensibly
with the separate and very unequal development of nations and
peoples.
