   SAN FRANCISCO -- California Energy Co. said it reached an
agreement to acquire certain geothermal operations from a
unit of Chevron Corp. for $68.7 million.
   The purchase price could be reduced to $51.2 million in
the event Chevron's partner in a Beowawe, Nev., operation
exercises a right of first refusal to buy Chevron's 50%
interest in a partnership that operates a 15.6-megawatt
facility.
