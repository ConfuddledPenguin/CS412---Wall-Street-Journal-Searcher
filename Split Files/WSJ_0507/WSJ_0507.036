   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians voted overwhelmingly to reject the
"final" contract proposal from National Broadcasting Co., a
unit of General Electric Co.
   An NBC spokeswoman said the next step will be to listen to
what NABET wants changed in the final contract. However, one
official said, "we're not changing our position that much
because this was our final offer."

   NABET, which represents about 2,500 technicians, writers
and producers, has been working without a contract since
March 31. In 1987, NABET went on strike against NBC for 17
weeks.
