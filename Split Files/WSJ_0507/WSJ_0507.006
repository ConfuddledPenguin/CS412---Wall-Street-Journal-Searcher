   Louisville, Ky. -- Unbridled, a classic late runner,
staged a classic late run to win the 116th Kentucky Derby
here Saturday, proving, if nothing else, that two seconds and
a third can add up to a first.
   Allow me to enumerate. Craig Perret, the winner's jockey,
was the second choice for the job, having been signed on
after Pat Day opted to ride Summer Squall, a beast from whom
more was expected Saturday. Further, Unbridled is the second
horse by that name owned by Mrs. Frances Genter, the first
having been a stakes winner of 40 or so years ago. ("When
you've owned as many horses as we have, you have to recycle
names once in awhile," explained Bentley Smith, Mrs. G's
son-in-law and manager of her racing interests.)

   And Unbridled -- the present one, not his predecessor --
was a conspicuous third in his last outing, chasing Summer
Squall down the homestretch of the Blue Grass Stakes at
Keeneland three weeks ago, only to lose rather than gain
ground near the finish.
   But that was then and this was now. The veteran Perret
made it clear after his triumph that he did not feel like
Secondhand Rose going in, and that the feeling grew as the
race unfolded.
   "With horses this good there's no telling who's best in
advance, and my horse let us know he was improving every day
leading up to this race," he declared. "In the paddock today,
I told Carl Nafzger Unbridled's trainer that all we needed
was this much run and we'd be in good shape. And in the
backstretch I knew for sure we were."
   Unbridled, a large and handsome brown colt, went off at
odds of almost 11-to-1 and rewarded his Churchill Downs
backers to the tune of $23.60 for each $2 they wagered. He
entered the gate as the fifth choice of the crowd of 128,257,
behind Mister Frisky (9-to-5), Summer Squall (2-1), Thirty
Six Red (6-1) and Silver Ending (6 1/2-1). His was the
largest Derby payoff since 1986, when Ferdinand won at 18-1,
and Mister Frisky's eighth-place finish marked the 11th
consecutive time that a favorite has failed.
   The race was notable in yet another negative fashion.
Jockey Day's second-place finish aboard Summer Squall was his
third straight as runner-up, a record. He charged Winning
Colors too late on Forty Niner in 1988 and was similarly
tardy behind Sunday Silence on Easy Goer last year. This
time, at least, was different, because Unbridled, full of
run, was pulling away at the finish. His margin was 3 1/2
lengths, and his time of 2:02 over the 1 1/4 miles was
considered good over a heavy track on a cool day that dawned
gray and ended bright.
   Despite the presence of 16 horses -- the kind of large
field in which the unexpected can happen -- this Kentucky
Derby was an almost-textbook example of the hoary race-track
adage that pace makes the race. The "speed" horses -- Real
Cash, Mister Frisky and Fighting Fantasy -- fought over first
place early, and Summer Squall and Thirty Six Red, who like
to run close to the lead, challenged from about the halfway
point. Smallish Summer Squall, who'd come in with a sterling
record of seven wins in eight starts against some of the
swiftest three-year-olds in the East, poked his neck in front
briefly after one mile.
   But Unbridled deviated from the norm by outdueling a horse
that had beaten him before. He was on Summer Squall's outside
shoulder at the mile, and, unlike at the Blue Grass, didn't
flinch. "I wasn't sure if I had Pat's horse {beaten} at the
5/16-mile pole, but when we got to the 1/4-pole I saw him hit
his horse left-handed," indicating that Summer Squall was
fading, Perret said. "I thought `Pat, you're in trouble]'
Then we put out a little more energy and moved away, and I
thought `This is great]'" And it was.
   "We thought the Blue Grass would be a nice race to win,
but our real goal always was the Derby," Perret said more
quietly. "We were dead ready this time, and everything opened
up for us right. We had a golden trip."
   "When Summer Squall took the lead, he just lost
concentration," Day testified. "He got back into it when
Unbridled came by, but it wasn't the burst I anticipated. He
was kind of halfhearted from that point."
   Mister Frisky, who'd wowed 'em in Puerto Rico and
California by winning 16 straight races before Saturday,
pooped out after his early struggle for the lead. Thirty Six
Red, the darling of Gotham off his Wood Memorial win,
finished ninth. Show money went to Pleasant Tap, a 40-to-1
shot who came on late, but he ended 9 1/2 lengths behind the
winner and never was a factor.
   Unbridled's victory was accompanied by firsts of the sort
that racing folks cherish. Mrs. Genter is a 92-year-old
resident of Minneapolis who has owned horses for more than 50
years, originally with her late first husband, Harold,
without having an entrant in the sport's most-celebrated
event. Trainer Nafzger, 48, is a former rodeo rider who had
instructed Thoroughbreds for 20-odd years with similar
fortune, and jockey Perret, who has been at it about as long,
also hadn't previously made the winner's circle in the Run
for the Roses.
   Mrs. Genter doesn't get around easily anymore, but
attended the race in a wheelchair, wearing a veiled blue hat,
blue-and-white polka-dot suit and blue raincoat. Nafzger, his
cheek smudged with celebratory lipstick, said that when
Unbridled won the Florida Derby in March, the most important
of his three previous victories, he promised her a box at
Churchill Downs for the Big One, equipped with a TV set.
   Apparently, the TV set didn't make it, because Nafzger
said he called the race for his patron. "I told her how we
broke eleventh and started moving up, nice and relaxed. Then
we were sixth, fifth and fourth. In the homestretch, when we
took the lead and moved away so smooth, I told her, `Miz
Genter, you've got yourself a Kentucky Derby winner.' "
   And what did she say?
   "She just said, `Ohhh]'" he smiled.
