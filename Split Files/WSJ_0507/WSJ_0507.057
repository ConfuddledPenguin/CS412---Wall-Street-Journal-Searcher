   NEW YORK -- American Express Co. wants more of your money.
   The travel and financial-services giant has a new
"Membership Savings" account, which will pay interest on
deposits made with a cardholder's regular monthly bill. The
interest rate is guaranteed to be higher than the average on
bank money market accounts, and deposits up to $100,000 will
be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

   Market research showed that cardholders "really want to
begin saving more," said Sarah M. Nolan, president of the
investment and insurance services group of American Express
Travel Related Services. "They want to have savings made as
easy and habit-forming as spending."
   Under the program, which American Express plans to
introduce in eight states and the District of Columbia this
month and nationwide by the end of the year, cardmembers who
sign up will be billed a specified amount to go into the
savings account each month. To withdraw funds, they can call
a toll-free telephone number to receive a check, or, for a
$10 fee, the money can be wired into a cardholder's bank
account.
   American Express will "make prudent investments" with the
funds deposited, Ms. Nolan said, "nothing different than what
any financial institution would do." She declined to be more
specific.
   Separately, American Express is offering certain
cardholders a line of credit at an interest rate of nine
percentage points over the prime rate. With the prime
currently at 10%, the rate on the line of credit would be
19%.
   "We consider ourselves a broad-based financial
institution," said Ms. Nolan, adding that the two new
products are "attempts to satisfy our cardmembers."
   The line of credit is being offered through American
Express Centurion Bank, based in Wilmington, Del. The savings
account is offerd by American Express Resource Co., an
industrial loan corporation chartered in Utah, which Ms.
Nolan said "meets the regulations and requirements" for FDIC
insurance.
   The interest rate on the savings account is pegged at half
a percentage point more than the average of the 100 largest
banks and thrifts in the nation, as published weekly by Bank
Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter. The
average is now 6.06%, which would mean a 6.56% rate on the
American Express account.
   A number of banks and thrifts, however, are offering more
than 7% on money market accounts, and the average yield on
money market mutual funds is currently just below 8%.
Nevertheless, Ms. Nolan said, American Express expects "an
enthusiastic reception" for the new savings account because
of its convenience and the small minimum deposit of $50.
   Participants in the program can deposit more or less than
the specified amount, or miss a deposit. The account is being
introduced in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland,
Virginia, Georgia, Wisconsin, Ohio, Oregon and in Washington,
D.C.
