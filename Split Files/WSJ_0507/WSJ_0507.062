   NEW YORK -- Two Wall Street executives and a former
retailing head formed Zenkel Ruskin &amp; Schoenfeld, a
merchant-banking partnership to serve closely held small and
medium businesses.
   The three partners are Bruce Zenkel, former president of
McKinley Allsopp Capital Holding Inc.; Lester Schoenfeld, a
former managing director of Merrill Lynch & Co.; and M.
Ronald Ruskin, former president of Batus Retail Group, which
supervised the U.S. retail units of B.A.T Industries PLC,
London.

   "We want to provide services not generally available to
smaller companies," says Mr. Ruskin. Such services will
include providing equity capital, strategic financial and
operational advice as well as traditional investment-banking
services.
   The partnership, one of the many boutiques being formed by
former Wall Street executives, also will assist public
companies in divestiture efforts.
