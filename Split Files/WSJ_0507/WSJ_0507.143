   Turning Over an Old Leaf

   In salads I'm
   Not picky, no;
   But I eschew
   Radicchio,
   And arugula
   Is depressing
   Even under
   Loads of dressing.
   So, if exotic
   Goodies fret us,
   We should stick
   To plain old lettuce.
   -- Robert Gordon.

   The New Elite
                                                                                                       

   Not titles, status, fame nor chic,
   Nor plaques upon the wall;
   We win our place in the elect
   With low cholesterol.
   -- Richard F. Barrett.

   New Standards
                                                                                                       

   These days a man isn't known by the company he keeps, but
by the ones he takes over.
   -- Marguerite Whitley May.
