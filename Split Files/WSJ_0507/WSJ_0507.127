   NEW YORK -- Woolworth Corp.'s April sales soared 21%,
because the period included Easter buying while the
year-earlier period didn't.
   Domestic sales rose to $421 million in the four weeks
ended April 28, compared with $348 million a year earlier.
Equally impressive, domestic sales growth for stores open at
least one year increased 18%.

   "Our April sales were unusually positive because we had
all of the Easter business, as opposed to last year, when
Easter occurred in March," said Harold Sells, chairman and
chief executive of the retailer. If March and April were
taken as a single reporting period, he said, domestic sales
were up 8.3% and domestic comparable store sales rose 5.4%.
   Mr. Sells said that Woolworth was particularly strong in
Easter candies and gifts, as well as merchandise related to
the Simpsons, which are popular TV cartoon characters. Ninja
turtles and Nintendo game cartridges were also in demand,
said Mr. Sells. The apparel business was mixed. Men's apparel
was strong, but children's apparel sales softened.
   "About half of our Kids Mart children's stores are in
Caifornia, and last year they had an unusual heat wave that
benefited us tremendously," said Mr. Sells. "This year the
weather was back to normal. We showed gains, but not as much
as in men's wear."
   For the 13 weeks ended April 28, domestic sales increased
9.7% to $1.23 billion against $1.12 billion in 1989.
