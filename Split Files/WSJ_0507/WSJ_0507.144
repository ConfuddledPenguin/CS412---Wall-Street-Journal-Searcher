   WASHINGTON -- Four top congressional leaders told
President Bush that, pending consultations with their
members, they are ready to begin talks on a package of big
tax increases and spending cuts aimed at significantly
reducing the federal deficit.
   At a meeting last night at the White House, President Bush
signaled his willingness to consider raising taxes, according
to House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.
"Everything is on the table," Rep. Michel quoted the
president as saying. A White House spokesman had no immediate
response.

   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said he will
recommend to House Democrats that they open negotiations with
the White House. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,
Maine) wouldn't share his views before talking to other
senators, but Rep. Michel said Sen. Mitchell indicated to Mr.
Bush that he, too, is willing to talk.
   The two top Democrats joined Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole (D., Kan.) and Rep. Michel in the president's quarters
in the White House for a meeting with the president that
lasted more than an hour. Mr. Bush was joined by Budget
Director Richard Darman, Chief of Staff John Sununu and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   The four congressional leaders said that they agreed to
talk again with Mr. Bush within days, perhaps as early as
tomorrow night or Wednesday, after each of them meets with
his rank-and-file members.
   Increasingly fearful that rising interest rates threaten
the continued economic expansion on which Mr. Bush's
re-election hopes rest, the White House has been increasingly
anxious to get bipartisan talks going. Some Democrats,
unhappy with the results of last year's so-called budget
summit, have been resistant. But that resistance seems to be
receding.
   "We're going to need some coordination if we're going to
meet the requirements of this year," Speaker Foley said
outside the White House last night. To avoid triggering
across-the-board budget cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law, Mr.
Darman has said, Congress and the White House need to find at
least $45 billion and perhaps $55 billion in
deficit-reduction measures. Neither the budget that passed
last week in the House, nor the one approved by the Senate
Budget Committee, satisfies that goal.
   Reducing the approximately $150 billion deficit by that
much is almost certain to require sizable tax increases,
congressional leaders said. "I don't know how you make these
figures match without doing some on revenues," Rep. Michel
told reporters outside the White House. "I don't think we're
going to be talking about a small package of doings."
   Last night's meeting may prove to have been the opening
ceremony for the bipartisan deficit-reduction compromise that
has proved so elusive for the past several years. But the
political obstacles remain significant. Last year's budget
summit, which involved many of the same people, demonstrated
that bipartisan consensus can sometimes yield little more
than a package of modest spending cuts and major accounting
gimmicks.
   According to Rep. Michel, Sen. Mitchell told Mr. Bush that
he insisted on only two things: that everything be on the
table and that "we not fight it out every day in the press."
Sen. Mitchell himself told reporters only that "there was
general agreement that any discussions will be without
preconditions, if and when they occur."
   "We didn't discuss any specifics," Speaker Foley said.
Instead, the conversation focused primarily on "the process
by which we might begin discussions." Both he and Mr. Darman
have said that this year's talks, unlike last year's, must
involve the chairmen of the powerful congressional
tax-writing and appropriations panels to assure that any pact
is implemented. The president himself might chair the first
few negotiating sessions, Rep. Michel said.
   If talks proceed, the major issues are likely to include
what price Democrats want for agreeing to cut capital-gains
taxes, what kinds of tax increases both sides can support,
how much to cut the defense budget, how best to control the
rapid growth of Medicare and other so-called entitlement
programs and what other domestic spending programs to pare.
Mr. Darman and some congressional leaders say the only way to
enact such an unpopular package is for both parties to
embrace it simultaneously.
   Mr. Darman also wants to take up changes in the federal
budgeting process. Congressional Democrats also want to
change budgetary accounting so they can say that aren't any
longer relying on the Social Security surplus to reduce the
deficit in the rest of the government.
