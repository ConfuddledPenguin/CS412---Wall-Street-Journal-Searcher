   Seattle last week began extending health benefits to
unmarried partners of city employees, making it the largest
city in the U.S. to offer such benefits.
   The move might encourage campaigns by civil- and
gay-rights activists to convince other cities and states to
provide such benefits for domestic partners.

   Seattle decided last fall to extend the benefits after its
Human Rights Department ruled that the city was violating its
own anti-discrimination laws by not providing coverage to
unmarried partners. Several other cities and states have
similar laws that civil-rights groups argued should be
interpreted in the same way.
   Seattle's decision also reflects the impact of the repeal
in December of a seemingly unrelated tax law. The law was
meant to prohibit inequitable benefit plans, but because of
the way it defined "family" it would have severely penalized
plans covering unmarried partners. Proponents of
domestic-partner coverage say the tax regulation, known as
Section 89, would have made it unfeasible for any employer to
offer such benefits.
   "The repeal of Section 89 takes away the only serious tax
impediment," said Matthew Coles, a lawyer with the American
Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California. Mr.
Coles is a member of a task force appointed by San
Francisco's mayor to study possible domestic-partner benefits
in that city.
   The law, adopted as part of a tax-revision package in
1988, was to take effect Jan. 1, 1990, but during the budget
process it was repealed for reasons that had nothing to do
with unmarried couples.
   People were "holding their breath" until Section 89 was
dropped, said Evan Wolfson, a lawyer with Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, a gay-rights group based in New
York. Mr. Wolfson said he expects proposals to be introduced
this year to extend health benefits to unmarried partners of
New York City and New York state employees.
   Only West Hollywood, Santa Cruz, and Berkeley, Calif.,
offer some health benefits to domestic partners. Several
private employers provide some health benefits to unmarried
partners; those plans too would have been jeopardized by
Section 89.
   Although domestic-partner benefits would apply to all
workers regardless of their sexual orientation, it is a
particularly strong concern for many gay and lesbian
employees. "Seattle's experience is going to show there's no
reason not to treat all people equally. It's a civil-rights
issue," Mr. Wolfson said. "It's a strong affirmation of what
we have been arguing in New York. This is the right thing to
do and it can be done."
   Plans such as Seattle's don't put unmarried relationships
on equal footing with married couples. The biggest difference
is that, for unmarried partners, the increase in the
employer-paid insurance premium is usually treated as taxable
income for the employee. Seattle is waiting for a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service on how city employees will be
affected.
   Nearly 200 Seattle employees, or 2% of the work force,
have signed up for the coverage, said Claudia Ellsworth, the
city's employee-services administrator. The city expected 3%
of the work force to sign up. Based on that estimate, it
budgeted about $430,000 to pay for the benefits this year.
   Ms. Ellworth said nearly three-fourths of the enrollees
are part of heterosexual couples. To qualify for the
benefits, city employees have to sign affidavits swearing
that the relationship is exclusive, that the partners aren't
related by blood, that they share household expenses, and
that they "are responsible for each other's common welfare."
Married employees have to sign the same affidavit.
   "The importance of getting domestic-partner benefits is
making society acknowledge that there are people,
particularly gay people, in serious relationships that aren't
defined by marriage," Mr. Coles said.
