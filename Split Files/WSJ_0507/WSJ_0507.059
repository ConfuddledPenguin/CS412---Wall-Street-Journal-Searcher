   My own discussions with janitors and other hard-working
laborers regarding the intellectual community have yielded
similar replies to those expressed in "That's No Okie, That's
My Torts Professor" by Brian Timmons (editorial page, April
3). The "common man" is fully aware that direct meddling by
wealthy individuals and even left-wing professors is
sometimes motivated by self-promotion.
   Given the opportunity, the "common man" will inform those
with wealth, power or "educational prestige" that he desires
consistent work with fair pay, a safe work environment,
competent management, adequate health care and a society that
allows his children to fulfill their dreams. With this in
mind, the "left-leaning" academics go to work on theories,
research papers and seminars. It is not the fault of
professors that "these theories are not published for the
common man to read, but to win notoriety, tenure and chaired
professorships from other academics."

   We do not expect an engineering professor to publish works
that would enable all readers to build their own cars or
generate their own electricity -- instead, manufacturers and
utilities use the professor's work to provide goods and
services to society. Almost all original work completed in
all fields of academia require interpretation by an
intermediary before the benefits of that work can be
delivered to society. Therefore "left-wing theories
propounded from ivory towers" cannot be delivered directly to
all of society; they must be carried on by intermediaries
such as the media, business and institutional managers and
executives, politicians and bureaucrats.
   Before beginning graduate study at Wright State
University, an acquaintance who had recently finished his
graduate study advised me that I should have some sort of
symbol of sacrifice that would serve as a reminder of my
goals in graduate study. Perhaps the boots worn by the
Harvard Law professor are his personal reminder, not a badge
of leftism.

   We applaud Mr. Timmons for his article on left-wing
law-school professors. However, some of his words and phrases
make one fear that he's already been too long in the world of
left-wing professors. Examples: "perceived knowledge and
prestige that emanate from academia"; "leftism that pervades
universities furtively molds"; "putative"; "apologists"; and
the worst of them "redistributionists."
   Let Mr. Timmons not lose his healthy Idaho roots in
"turgid" academia.

   Like Mr. Timmons, I went to Harvard Law School from a
blue-collar background. Also like him, my politics are well
to the right of Prof. Duncan Kennedy's. To the limited extent
I bother to follow them, I frequently find Prof. Kennedy's
writings and speeches somewhat silly.
   Apparently unlike Mr. Timmons, however, I always have
thought Prof. Kennedy an excellent teacher in the classroom
and am glad to have had him as a torts professor. Many of his
other former students undoubtedly feel the same. I hope these
perceptions are not drowned out entirely by the shrillness of
Mr. Timmons's admittedly clever attacks.

   It is reassuring to me that there are law students such as
Mr. Timmons who will speak out against the hypocrisy of the
many liberal professors at law schools in our country. One
can only hope he will survive the exposure, go on to academic
greatness and have an opportunity to redress the
philosophical imbalance inherent today in so many
universities.

   Mr. Timmons is hardly on target in insinuating that Prof.
Kennedy would be less of a "zealous redistributionist{s}" if
"educational prestige" -- rather than wealth and economic
advantage -- were the target of reform. To the contrary,
Prof. Kennedy has been a leading critic of the many elitist
aspects of traditional legal education; he is a vigorous
proponent of affirmative action in hiring and admissions, and
he has even proposed randomizing law-school admissions for
qualified candidates. As for pitching in to help "the common
man," we wish Mr. Timmons luck in doing as much for the
nation's elite as Prof. Kennedy has already accomplished on
behalf of the rest of America in his work on welfare and
housing issues for Jamaica Plain legal services office, in
his fund-raising efforts for the union campaigns among
Harvard's technical and clerical workers, and in his
inspiration and support of countless students who've gone on
to serve the public interest. In short, Mr. Timmons will have
to look elsewhere to substantiate his charge that progressive
intellectuals are merely out to win "notoriety and tenure."
   What disturbs us most about Mr. Timmons's enterprise,
however, is his wholehearted embrace of a bitterly divided
America. He claims academics are held in "contempt" by the
"common man," yet reveals his own distaste for the common
life that he says he is "trying desperately to escape." Prof.
Kennedy's job-swapping suggestion for overcoming such
attitudes may be somewhat impractical, but at least he cares
enough to try. By contrast, Mr. Timmons's vision of an
endlessly embittered future reminds us of the comments of one
elderly Harvard janitor at a graduation about a decade ago:
"If these are our future leaders," he remarked, "I'm glad I'm
dying."
