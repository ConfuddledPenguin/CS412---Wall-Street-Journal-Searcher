   In the light of mounting U.S. pressure against Soviet
actions in Lithuania, the trade bill recently negotiated with
the Soviets is in jeopardy. But even if the bill were signed,
it is unlikely to reassure American investors, actual or
potential; the reports of Soviet joint ventures gone sour are
becoming legion. The magnitude of the failures has already
prompted the Soviets to initiate a wholesale overhaul of
their joint venture legislation. But the draft legislation
now circulating in Moscow may well deter further foreign
investment.
   In the three years since the Soviets adopted legislation
permitting joint ventures with foreign partners, hungry
Western companies have swooped down into Moscow, hoping to
penetrate this market of 285 million potential consumers. But
finding a partner, negotiating an agreement and registering
the venture takes an average one year. Few Western companies
have the resources or stamina to survive the arduous
undertaking. Maria Aronson, of the U.S. Commercial Office in
Moscow, told me of numerous invitations to ceremonies to sign
letters of intent to enter into joint ventures -- but wonders
aloud why she rarely hears anything from the parties after
the signing.

   Of about 10,000 letters of intent signed so far between
Soviet organizations and Western companies (about 1,000 of
which are U.S. companies), only about 1,500 (about 150 U.S.
companies) have produced registered joint ventures -- and
only about 140 joint ventures have commenced operations
(about 35 of which are U.S. companies).
   Once operating, joint ventures face an unforgiving
bureaucracy, supply shortages and a severe lack of
infrastructure. A study I did on Soviet joint ventures
already operating found that 43% of those sampled have not
performed to the expectations of the parties. A Ministry of
Finance official told me that the Soviets are also deeply
disappointed with the results of joint ventures.
   STIM, a Soviet-U.S. joint venture specializing in
children's toys, for example, was supposed to earn hard
currency by countertrade -- until the Soviets proscribed
countertrade for joint ventures, leaving the joint venture
"dead in the water," according to its general director,
Stephen S. Moody.
   A major subject of disagreement between the Soviet and
Western partners is the strategic direction of the joint
venture. The Western partner generally wants to confine the
joint venture's activities to a discrete area. The Soviet
partner, in contrast, wants to expand into activities
unrelated to the strategic competence of the Western partner.
(Although not a joint venture, the PepsiCo deal with the
Soviets might cause one to ask what PepsiCo's competitive
advantage is in selling shipssomething Pepsico has now agreed
to do in exchange for Soviet market share.)
   The personnel of the Soviet partner view themselves as
experts in the Soviet system, rather than in a particular
industry. They sincerely believe that the joint venture is
well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities even
in unrelated industries.
   One joint venture, Intermedbio-I.M.B., formed to produce
pharmaceuticals, started sponsoring television productions.
Not surprisingly, the activities of the venture are "frozen,"
and the U.S. partner is seeking to withdraw, according to
Charles Rudd, a member of Intermedbio's board of directors.
   And there are other "cultural" problems. To assure its
guests of high quality food, INFA-Hotel, a Finish-Soviet
hotel joint venture, imports food directly from Finland. But
there is a Russian proverb that, "if you don't steal, you
won't survive." The Soviet employees of the hotel are rumored
to be substituting Russian fare for the imported food.
   Even success may bring complications. One joint venture in
the automotive industry has reportedly done so well that the
management is concerned that the Soviet government will close
the venture down on charges of profiteering.
   The vagaries of the Soviet marketplace exact a heavy toll
from even the most persevering companies. Western companies
entering simple purchase agreements are increasingly
demanding letters of credit, because the Soviets have been
unable to make their hard-currency payments. Also, the
political climate changes almost daily. Those companies that
have entered into joint ventures with Soviet organizations in
one of the Baltic republics or one of the republics in the
Caucasus should consult their political risk assessment
teams.
   The legal climate fares no better. University of Illinois
law professor Peter B. Maggs, an expert on Soviet law,
reports that legislation on joint ventures is "unstable,
unpredictable and largely unpublished." In December, for
example, without any advance warning, the Soviet government
pushed through new legislation imposing further export quotas
and licensing requirements. On the same day that the decree
was adopted, an unwary joint venture in the food industry
attempted to ship goods worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars. Soviet customs officials refused to allow the ship
to sail. Only after several days of intense negotiations did
the authorities allow the ship to leave.
   Some joint ventures -- such as Dialog, which develops
computer software -- have recently received hopeful
attention. But these cases are the exception. The Soviets
have proposed a comprehensive new joint venture law. But
instead of reaching out for foreign investment and
technology, in March of 1989 the Soviets forbade joint
ventures to engage in countertrade, one of only a few
mechanisms by which a joint venture can generate hard
currency. The draft law would reinforce this prohibition.
   A widely leaked unpublished portion of the current joint
venture legislation established an exception to hard currency
self-sufficiency requirements. But the draft law would revoke
this exception, requiring joint ventures to generate
sufficient hard currency to cover their expenditures.
   The draft law also gives short shrift to small
entrepreneurial ventures. It would require the Western
partner to contribute a minimum of $100,000, 25% of which the
Western partner must deposit in cash in a Soviet bank before
the Soviets will register the joint venture. It wholly
ignores the 1,500 joint ventures that have already been
registered; the Soviets have omitted any grandfather clause,
thereby potentially placing these joint ventures into
legislative limbo.
   The Soviet market presents tremendous opportunities,
offering a wealth of natural resources, inexpensive labor,
areas of advanced technology and a market of 285 million
consumers. As Western companies seek to capitalize on these
opportunities, they should recognize that penetrating this
market is a tortuous road fraught with uncertainty and
instability.
