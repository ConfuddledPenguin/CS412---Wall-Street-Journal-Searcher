   Hawker Siddeley Group PLC, a British electrical and
mechanical engineering concern, warned that its 1990 profit
figures will fall short of 1989 figures.
   Its 1989 pretax profit was #202.1 million ($363.6 million)
and sales were #2.15 billion. Hawker Siddeley shares fell 62
pence to 548 pence on the London Stock Exchange. Turnover
amounted to a robust 5.4 million shares.

   The company said that the "deterioration" is mostly due to
a situation at its electrical power contracting business, the
Hawker Siddeley Power Engineering unit, where an
investigation disclosed an estimated loss for 1990 of between
#25 million and #30 million, the company said.
   The losses were caused by cost overruns that arose when
the unit became overextended by rapid expansion in 1988 on
projects due for completion in 1990, the company said.
   But the company said that measures have been taken to
correct the project-control problems and that the unit's
capacity hasn't been damaged.
