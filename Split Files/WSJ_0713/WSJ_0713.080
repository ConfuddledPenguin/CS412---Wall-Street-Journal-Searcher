   CHICAGO -- Prices of soybean and related futures contracts
are expected to rally at the opening today on lower supply
and higher usage estimates in a new government report.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department report, released after the
markets closed yesterday, contained the first production
estimates of the spring wheat crop, which is grown in the
Northern Plains. But analysts said the report's biggest price
impact is likely to be in the pits where soybean, soybean oil
and soybean meal futures are traded.

   The Agriculture Department raised its estimates of U.S.
exports and trimmed its estimate of U.S. stockpiles. The
government said U.S. soybean stockpiles, by Aug. 31 will have
fallen to 275 million bushels, down 20 million bushels from
its earlier estimate.
   The government's most surprising move was to slash its
estimate of U.S. stockpiles for August 1991 by 80 million
bushels to 265 million.
   "Given the fact that prices have declined fairly sharply
this week, we'll probably see a rally as a result of this
report," said Anne Frick, soybean analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   In part, analysts said, the figures reflect the fact that
an unusually wet spring prevented farmers from planting as
many acres of soybeans as expected.
   Among other things, analysts said U.S. exports of soybeans
are being helped by the problems of its biggest competitor.
Farmers in Brazil have been roiled by the country's campaign
to fight hyper-inflation. As a result, importers are expected
to buy an additional 10 million bushels of U.S. soybeans,
said Daniel Basse, director of market research for AgResource
Co.
   "On the opening I think it {the price of soybean futures
contracts} will be three to five, maybe even 10 cents higher
because not only did they estimate a lower crop but also
raised the usage," said Steve Freed, of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   The government report estimated a total 1990 wheat harvest
at 2.7 billion bushels, up 33% from last year's production,
but analysts said the market had already taken account of
those numbers, which were as expected.
   Spring wheat, which accounts for 20% of total wheat
production, was estimated to rise to 549 million bushels, 59
million more than last year, in line with analysts'
expectations.

   COPPER: Futures prices rose on the possibility that an
easing of the Federal Reserve's credit policy may spur
increased use of copper. September delivery copper rose 2.05
cents a pound to $1.2405. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told
the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed was poised to ease
its credit policy to offset a developing credit crunch. The
automobile and construction industries, heavy users of
copper, would greatly benefit from a credit easing, and it
could spur greater demand for the metal, an analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices for gold and silver rose,
and those for platinum largely recovered from sharp early
declines sparked by an apparent readiness of the Fed to ease
its credit policy. A strong crude oil market, with its
inflation potential, also was a price-firming factor,
analysts said. August delivery gold ended with a gain of
$3.90 an ounce at $359.50. September silver was up 5.1 cents
an ounce at $4.9480. October platinum had a loss of $2.40 an
ounce at $478.90, after trading as low as $472.50. Precious
metals prices rose following a plunge in the dollar in
reaction to Fed Chairman Greenspan's comments.
                                                                                                       

   COFFEE: Futures prices fell on speculation that a meeting
of the executive board of the International Coffee
Organization scheduled for July 23 might be canceled. The
September futures contract declined 2.05 cents a pound to
85.95 cents. Prices have been bolstered recently by the
possibility that coffee export quotas, which were suspended
last year, might be revived at the meeting requested by
Brazil. Late Wednesday, according to a trade source,
Brazilian government officials and exporters decided to call
for the meeting to be canceled. There was no confirmation
from the Brazilian government of a request to cancel the
meeting. Another trade source said, however, that a
government official was expected to make an announcement on
coffee policy today. Meanwhile, Jorge Cardenas, president of
the Colombian Federation of Coffee Growers, met with Brazil's
president Wednesday. No report was issued after the meeting.
