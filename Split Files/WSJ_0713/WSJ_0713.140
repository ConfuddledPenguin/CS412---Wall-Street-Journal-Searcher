   Veba AG of West Germany, a trading, chemical and power
generation concern, said it expects to report that its
first-half sales rose 8% from a year earlier to more than 26
billion marks ($15.77 billion).
   But in remarks prepared for the annual meeting, VEBA
Chairman Klaus Piltz also said profit for the half probably
will only about match that of a year earlier, though he
didn't provide specifics. In the 1989 first six months,
Veba's profit rose 19% from a year earlier to 397 million
marks on a 14% rise in sales to 24.38 billion marks.

   Mr. Piltz said that VEBA this year has been faced with
weaker earnings in the chemical and petrochemical sector, but
that this will be offset partly by "higher yields" in some
other areas and by benefits of lower taxes.
   He said that for all of 1990, the company expects again to
record a good year in general, but he wasn't more specific.
VEBA's 1989 profit rose 14% from a year earlier to 1.25
billion marks, on a 12% increase in sales to 49.9 billion
marks.
