   YELTSIN QUIT the Soviet Communist Party as a wave of
defections loomed.
   Just as Gorbachev seemed to have stitched the divided
party together, the Soviet president's toughest radical
opponent started tearing it apart, perhaps for good. Yeltsin,
a former Politburo member recently elected president of the
Russian republic, has a huge popular following. Within an
hour of his announcement, several leaders of the party's
radical Democratic Platform group told a party congress they
were formally splitting and planned to set up an independent
party.

   Yeltsin may be better attuned to the Soviet mood than
Gorbachev. Wednesday's strike by coal miners was driven by
demands for a revamping of the party along lines proposed by
Yeltsin.

   STRIKERS ENDED their often-violent walkout after Managua
made concessions.
   As the price for her own political survival, Nicaragua's
President Chamorro agreed to key wage and economic demands of
the pro-Sandinista unions that led the 10-day strike, which
brought gun battles to the streets of the capital. Public
employees won an immediate 43% pay raise and another,
unspecified raise to come next month. The government agreed
not to fire those taking part in what it had declared an
illegal walkout and said it will pay compensation to 800
people who had been fired since April.
   The strikers also forced the U.S.-supported conservative
government to back down on its proposal to return lands that
were confiscated in the 1979 revolution.

   A Senate committee decided against providing any money to
put nuclear-tipped MX missiles on specially equipped trains.

repudiation of a key part of the Bush administration's
nuclear-weapons policies.

Senate and win Bush's signature.

development since World War II. The Hanford facility has been
closed since late 1988.

   Researchers reported that they used a new genetically
engineered protein in rats as a way of limiting the damage of
a heart attack, and they suggested the protein could do the
same in humans. The research also could lead to new therapies
for arthritis, as well as other inflammatory diseases, the
scientists suggested.

and medical research.

   Some 4,500 Albanian refugees were due to arrive at an

nation.

to be passed by the full Senate.
