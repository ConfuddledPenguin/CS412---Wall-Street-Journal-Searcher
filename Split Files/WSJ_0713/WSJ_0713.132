   Rausey W. Mason, 52, was elected president and chief
executive officer of Fortune Financial. He has served as
executive vice president of the company. Both individuals
succeed John A. Moran, 57, who resigned to obtain regulatory
approval for his company to increase its ownership of Fortune
Financial's stock. Mr. Moran is chairman of New York-based
Dyson Kissner-Moran Corp., a closely held investment company
that owns 9.97% of the holding company's stock.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision has stipulated that Mr.

outstanding. Mr. Moran will remain as a director of both
Fortune Financial Group and its subsidiary, Fortune Savings
Bank.
