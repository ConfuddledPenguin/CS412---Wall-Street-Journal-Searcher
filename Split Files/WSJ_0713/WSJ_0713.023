   OTTAWA -- Canadian housing starts declined 7.3% in June to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 190,000, which was their
lowest level in more than four years and down from a May rate
of 205,000, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., a federal
agency, said.
   The decline in new housing construction is expected to
continue in coming months, said Mark Burchinshaw, the
agency's chief economist. He attributed the drop in starts to
slower Canadian economic growth, higher interest rates and
reduced consumer confidence.
