   EGILSSTATHIR, Iceland -- It is a mile between farms in
this bleak outpost of fog and stone, but just a few paces to
the nearest hidden home.
   "A family moved in here years ago," says Helgi
Hallgrimsson, tapping a large boulder. "They raise cows, I
think." A family down the road herds sheep. They live in a
tree trunk. Generally, though, elves prefer stones. "It is
easier to find such housing," Mr. Hallgrimsson says, standing
on a hill that is bare except for a few Siberian pines.

   Returning to his own simple farmhouse, Mr. Hallgrimsson
dines on bread made with sheep's blood, and curdled milk
mixed with moss. Asked if the rock dwellers eat similar fare,
he responds: "Probably so. But you know, they have never
invited me to visit."
   Mr. Hallgrimsson's neighbors are "huldufolk," a word
meaning "hidden people." They also are known as "alfar," or
elves. While Iceland isn't the only country with elves --
Ireland and Sweden have them, too -- few are so accommodating
to unseen citizens. Icelandic highways dogleg to skirt large
rocks, lest engineers dislodge the occupants of "enchanted
spots." Farmers politely leave fields unplowed because hidden
people need hay for their hidden cows. Huldufolk homes appear
on environmental-impact statements, and factory construction
can sometimes halt while elves find someplace else to live.
   "The only thing we haven't done is give huldufolk the
vote," says Stefan Stefansson, a fisherman in Reykjavik, the
nation's capital. Like many Icelanders, he is slippery on the
subject of elves. "Do I believe in huldufolk?" he asks,
staring into his beer. "I am one."
   When more than 900 people were asked the question in a
University of Iceland survey, 55% said the existence of
huldufolk (and fairies) is possible, probable or certain.
Only 10% answered, "impossible." Erlendur Haraldsson, the
psychologist who conducted the survey, wasn't surprised. Nor
does he think Icelanders are particularly superstitious.
"This isn't America," he says. "We have very few UFOs."
   If aliens ever should land here, they would no doubt feel
at home. When work began last year on an asphalt path in
Reykjavik, surveyors' instruments vanished and computers
developed glitches. The landscape architect directing the
project suspected supernatural mischief. She called in a
well-known psychic, Erla Stefansdottir, to investigate.
   Visiting the site, the 53-year-old piano teacher pats the
top of a rock mottled with lichen. "Just knocking to see if
anyone is home," she says. Thereupon a man with a long beard
and breeches emerges from the rock -- visible to her though
not to this reporter. "He's laughing at us," she says. "He
thinks we're crazy to be standing here staring at him."
   On her advice, the city rerouted the path to skirt this
and another inhabited rock. In the nearby town of Kopavogur,
"Elf Hill Road" narrows to one lane as it passes a rocky
outcropping. An attempt last year to widen the road ended
abruptly when a new jackhammer broke on the first day of
work. Town officials refer to the unseen rock dweller on an
adjoining lot as "the old man at No. 102."
   Elves in Iceland are as old as the hills. According to
Nordic lore, some of them are hills. Elves arrived in Iceland
with the Vikings and Celtic slaves who settled here 1,000
years ago. Extreme isolation, and Iceland's sagas and oral
lore, kept supernatural beliefs alive. So did Iceland's weird
landscape. Bubbling with volcanoes, geysers and boiling mud
pits, Iceland is so lunar in parts that it has been used to
train astronauts.
   Iceland also is sparsely populated, with just 250,000
people occupying an area the size of Ohio. "In such a lonely
place, it is natural to fill out the landscape with elves,"
says Hallfredur Eiriksson, a leading Icelandic folklorist.
   Perhaps it is only natural that Icelandic elves resemble
humans, rather than the dwarfish, often malevolent goblins of
Scandinavian legend. Country huldufolk fish for herring,
raise sheep and attend church, just like other folk. And in a
society so peaceful that it has no army and few police
stations open on weekends, humans and huldufolk usually get
on well. Midwives have told Mr. Eiriksson about delivering
elf babies. Farmers say they have milked elf cows. Sometimes,
the two peoples fall in love, though affairs of the heart
often end badly.
   "It should be nice to have invisible in-laws, but really
it can create problems," says Mr. Eiriksson.
   Icelanders who are skeptical about elves treat the issue
delicately, as an American parent might field a child's
questions about Santa Claus. Haukur Gudmasson, a Shell Oil
salesman, is that rare Icelander who openly declares: "This
talk of huldufolk is nonsense." But, later in the
conversation, he recalls his 16 years in the merchant marine:
"Whenever I worked in the engine room," he says, "there was
another man -- not a real person -- there at my side." The
fellow was blond, wore a wool sweater and helped Mr.
Gudmasson with his work. Could he have been an elf? The
salesman bristles. "A ghost, maybe," he says. "But I
certainly don't go around seeing people in stones."
   Very few Icelanders do, but almost everyone can tell when
elves are about. Guthmunder Svafarsson, a veteran road
engineer, remembers the time he tried to blast through a
ridge while building a highway in the north. Bulldozers broke
down, and residents had nightmares. Normally, he says, a
simple elf-diversion would have done the trick. But this was
a major project, with an added complication: The rock wasn't
merely occupied, it was cursed.
   "We had discussions," the engineer says, by which he means
that a medium contacted both the elves and the deceased woman
who had hexed the rock. They were of one mind: Build over,
rather than through, the ridge. "I was furious," says Mr.
Svafarsson, who has encountered elf delays on other
occasions. "But what could I do? Everyone except me believed
in elves."
   Work on a fish-meal factory in nearby Akureyri also ceased
when elves sabotaged machines. In that case, however, talks
proved fruitful. The elves said construction could resume,
but that they first needed three weeks to vacate. Workmen
obliged.
   Through one man's efforts, elf advocacy is becoming a
sophisticated science. Mr. Hallgrimsson, the farmer in stony
Egilsstathir, began his career as a botanist, specializing in
mushrooms. While gathering fungi, he collected folk tales as
well. Drawing on oral testimony and written records, he now
is mapping Iceland's supernatural population.
   He presented road builders in Akureyri with a detailed map
of the elf harbor and metropolis their highway would bisect
(they built it anyway). When plans were drawn up for an
aluminum smelter, which has yet to be built, he inserted a
map with a legend that includes: "Huldufolk Dwellings, Other
Spirits, Odd Shapes in the Stone." In Egilsstathir, he has
also gathered data on dwarfs, trolls and a humped serpent,
called "the Worm," that lives in a lake.
   Mr. Hallgrimsson, a 55-year-old with merry blue eyes and a
pointy gray beard, looks rather like a storybook elf himself.
Oddly, given all his research, he remains an agnostic on the
question of whether huldufolk truly exist. As a scientist, he
is most comfortable with empirical evidence, and so far all
his information is secondhand.
   "It would be enough," he says wistfully, "to see one elf."
