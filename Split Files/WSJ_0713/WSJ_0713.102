   CINCINNATI -- Vulcan International Corp. said it has
formed a joint venture with Brunswick Bowling and Billiard
Corp., a unit of Skokie, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp., to
manufacture bowling pins.
   The joint venture will allow Vulcan to expand its Antigo,
Wis., bowling pin plant to increase production to three times
its current capacity, the company said.
