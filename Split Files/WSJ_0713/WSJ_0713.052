   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department proposed rules
requiring chemical-plant managers to adopt rigorous safety
programs.
   The department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration had promised the rules in a report to
President Bush in April. That report covered explosions at a
Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics complex near Houston in
October. The explosion, one of the worst chemical-facility
disasters since World War II, killed 23 workers and injured
more than 130.

   OSHA completed work on the proposal following an explosion
last week at an Arco Chemical Co. plant in Channelview,
Texas, in which 17 workers died. Arco Chemical is a unit of
Atlantic Richfield Co.
   An OSHA spokesman said the timing of the government's
action wasn't influenced by the Arco explosion, though he
said the Phillips and Arco incidents tended to "crank up the
anxiety level" at the agency.
   Gerard Scannell, an assistant labor secretary who heads
OSHA, said the proposed standard culminates 18 months of
"intense, expedited work."
   Hundreds of workers were killed or injured in accidents at
chemical plants and refineries in the past two years. OSHA
and industry critics have singled out increased reliance by
companies on contract workers as one possible cause. A
preliminary report prepared for OSHA recently concluded that
the contract workers get less safety training than permanent
workers and are more loosely supervised.
   Safety-management plans advocated by OSHA would
incorporate policies already followed voluntarily by many
companies. These involve such steps as evaluating plant
valves for safety hazards, keeping equipment in good shape
and properly training both contractors and company workers.
   The agency estimated that the rules could prevent more
than 200 deaths and at least 720 injuries and illnesses a
year. The rules would cover about 2.2 million workers and
would cost chemical companies $233 million annually. OSHA
said the cost figure included a conservative estimate of
economic benefits that it said partly would offset direct
costs.
   OSHA said its proposal would require companies to conduct
"process hazard analysis," which it said will mean "a
thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying,
evaluating and controlling processes" that involve highly
hazardous chemicals.
   Besides covering chemical companies, the proposal would
affect workers in oil refining and related work, farm-goods
warehousing, wholesaling, liquid natural-gas production and
electric and water services, OSHA said.
   OSHA said it will take comments on the proposal through
Oct. 15, and a hearing is set for Nov. 27.
   Sylvia Krekel, an occupational health and safety official
for the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, criticized
the OSHA plan. "It's not going to stop the carnage," she
said, because it is "essentially written by the industry" and
puts no "great burden" on chemical plant managers to improve
safety. Ms. Krekel said it doesn't provide for input from
workers, and she predicted it would be "weak" on ensuring
that contract workers are well trained and adequately
supervised.
   Akio Konoshima, an OSHA spoksman, said the agency had
cooperation from unions and the industry in developing the
proposal, and he said the comment process and hearing will be
a forum for any such criticisms to be expressed.
