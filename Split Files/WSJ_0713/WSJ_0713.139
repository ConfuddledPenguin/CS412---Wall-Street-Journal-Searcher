   Rank Organisation PLC, a major U.K. communications and
entertainment concern, said pretax profit for the half year
to May 12 increased 24%, though the company forecast growing
difficulties stemming from poor economic conditions in the
U.K. and the U.S.
   Pretax profit increased to #137.6 million ($247.7 million)
from #111 million. Market forecasts had ranged between #135
million and #138 million. Sales increased 17% to #522.2
million from #447.4 million.

   Pretax profit from Rank Xerox, a joint venture between
Rank and Xerox Corp. of the U.S., rose 2.7% to #80 million
from #77.9 million. Fuji Xerox, located in Southeast Asia,
had a decline in profit to Rank caused by higher investment
in research and the development of products plus increases in
operating costs, said Rank.
   The company said its proposed acquisition of Mecca
Leisure, a rival U.K. leisure concern, is "a major step
forward in Rank's leisure activities in Europe and the U.S.,"
which should be beneficial to all shareholders.
