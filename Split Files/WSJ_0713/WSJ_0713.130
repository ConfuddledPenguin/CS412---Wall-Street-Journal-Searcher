   CPC International Inc. reported second-quarter earnings
climbed 14% on a sales increase of 16%, as the food producer
posted stronger operating profit in all geographic areas.
   CPC, with prominent brands such as Hellmann's and Best
Foods mayonnaise, Skippy peanut butter and Karo syrup, said
that its Latin American operations slipped a bit at the end
of the period. But the Englewood Cliffs, N.J., company
expects the operations to turn up again by the end of the
third quarter.
