   The mercurial market for computer workstations is about to
undergo another burst of change.
   Most of the change will come because International
Business Machines Corp. is beginning to flex its muscles as
it starts to deliver the impressive line of workstations it
announced early this year. Market researchers expect IBM to
go from essentially no market share in workstations to some
15% to 20% of the market over the next year and a half. And
that market share obviously must come out of somebody else's
hide.

   At the same time, Sun Microsystems Inc. has reasserted
itself as the leader of the market for workstations, powerful
machines used mainly by engineers. Hewlett-Packard Co. has
faltered. Digital Equipment Corp. has improved its product
line but confused its marketing message. Next Inc., Steve
Jobs' much-publicized new company, has failed to make any
impact. And several Japanese companies are preparing to enter
the market with clones of Sun's systems.
   "This is sort of like the battle of Waterloo," says
Charles Foundyller, president of Daratech Inc., a
market-research firm that focuses on workstations. "The Suns
and Digitals and HPs have fought themselves to a standstill,
and now we hear drums in the distance. Sun is slowly winning,
but now IBM is thundering on the scene with fresh troops and
seemingly inexhaustible resources."
   The market is important mainly because it is growing so
fast: Gartner Group Inc., a market-research firm, estimates
that the world-wide workstation market will nearly quadruple
to $19 billion in 1994 from $5 billion this year.
   But it is also important because part of that growth may
come at the expense of personal computers and minicomputers.
That is a matter of particular concern to companies such as
IBM that sell a wide range of machines.
   Workstations -- essentially very powerful personal
computers with high-resolution monitors -- are starting to
head down into the traditional personal-computer price range.
They are beginning to run similar software and eventually may
be sold through personal-computer dealers. Workstations are
also delivering so much computing power that, as software
becomes widely available over the next couple of years, they
could move out of their traditional preserve in engineering
departments and into the mainstream business applications
that minicomputers now handle.
   IBM, having failed in two prior efforts to crack the
workstation market, seems to have finally gotten things
right. The machines it began shipping in May are more
powerful than those of its major competitors and are priced
rather aggressively.
   The major hurdle was expected to be getting software
developers to make enough application packages available, a
problem that has hobbled Digital Equipment. And there have
been extensive reports in the trade press of bugs in IBM's
operating system, which would make application development
difficult. But software developers and consultants say that
the bugs have been stamped out almost entirely and that
application software will be available on time. IBM says that
by the end of the year it plans to have 1,500 major
application software packages and 7,000 total applications
available -- on a par with the numbers Sun can claim.
   Bill Filip, a senior marketing executive in IBM's
workstation operation, said orders have been at "the high end
of expectations." He pointed to an International Data Corp.
study that predicted IBM would sell 15,000 units this year
and said the total would be "substantially more than that."
He said IBM has already decided to expand its production
capacity. Until recently, someone ordering a machine would be
told he might not get it until next May.
   The biggest problem that IBM still faces is that it
doesn't have a low-end machine. Its line starts at $13,000
for a stripped-down machine, while Sun, for instance, starts
at around $5,000. IBM says it will correct that problem,
though probably not for almost a year. IBM executives also
indicated the machine's price might be $1,500 to $3,000
higher than Sun's.
   IBM also faces the standard problem in the workstation
market: The machines' power doubles every 12 to 18 months, so
companies must run hard just to stand still.
   Noting that other companies have announced fast machines
since the IBM announcement in February, Louise Rehling, a
senior vice president at software developer SPSS Inc., says
that IBM still has a lead in power, "but it's getting
narrower."
   Vicki Brown, an analyst at International Data, says she
expects IBM to be neck and neck with Digital Equipment for
the No. 2 spot by the end of next year -- with Sun still the
leader and HP slipping to fourth.
   HP has had problems partly for reasons beyond its control:
It had announced products based on the Motorola Inc. 68040
processor, but Motorola was more than nine months late in
shipping those chips. HP also has had trouble integrating its
product lines with those of Apollo Computer Inc., which it
acquired last year. Those problems are expected to keep a
damper on HP's workstation sales for the next year or so,
too.
   Competitors and consultants say Digital Equipment has
strengthened its product line considerably, overcoming some
earlier problems. But they add that Digital's marketing
message is muddled because it offers two types of machines:
those that use its own operating systems and those that use
Unix.
   Workstations typically use the Unix operating system,
which runs on hardware made by numerous companies, making it
easy to move Unix-based application software from one
company's computers to another's. But Digital has made its
mark by selling systems that use its proprietary operating
systems, which lock customers into buying Digital hardware
because their applications won't run on anyone else's boxes.
   More than most old-line companies, Digital has been slow
to make the move to Unix. Despite a growing Unix business,
Digital's blunt president, Ken Olsen, has labeled some claims
about the system "snake oil" and trashed its prospects at
every opportunity.
   Sun has rebounded from some problems last year and seems
to be in the best position for the next year or so. It has a
strong product line, including the new Sparcstations that
start at $5,000. It also has a clean marketing message, given
that it is only in the workstation market and doesn't have
any conflicting interests.
   Sun faces a wild card over the next year and a half
because it has licensed others to make Sparcstation clones
and could face an influx of Japanese competitors. Sun,
however, dismisses the potential for trouble. Chief Executive
Scott McNealy agrees that IBM lost market share to companies
that cloned its personal computers but says that IBM
generates personal-computer revenue of maybe $13 billion a
year. "Hurt me with that problem," Mr. McNealy says.
