   This month's issue features a spread on sexy
crushed-velvet playclothes and an update on go-go boots.
Which magazine is it: Elle or Vogue?
   As it happens, both of the fashion leaders include those
almost identical articles this month. And that may be part of
the problem at Vogue, the nation's No. 1 fashion book.

   Almost two years after ultra-chic editor Anna Wintour was
brought in to transform the staid Vogue into a younger,
hipper book, its ad pages are declining at a rapid clip.
Although the magazine industry as a whole is suffering,
Vogue's drop is steeper than most -- and is in sharp contrast
to its major competitors. Elle, whose trendy young design
helped prompt the Vogue overhaul, saw a 2.7% increase in ad
pages for the first seven months, for example, while Vogue's
pages dropped about 10%, according to Media Industry
Newsletter.
   The decline comes despite more than a year of almost
unfailing accolades for Ms. Wintour. The cool, British-born
editor has garnered scrapbooks full of fawning articles
chronicling her transformation of tired Vogue, which had
become the embodiment of the staid fashion doyennes to whom
it catered. Earlier this year, Adweek dubbed her Editor of
the Year, crowing, "Wintour's brought springtime to Vogue."
Under her stewardship, Vogue took on a fashion-forward look
sometimes reminiscent of Elle, smattering its pages with
models dressed in combinations of couture and kitsch.
   But for all the publicity and plaudits, "she's had no
impact on advertising," contends Martin Walker, a Manhattan
magazine consultant. "The changes she's wrought in the
magazine haven't resulted in any meaningful impact, or
increase in market share."
   Some advertising executives say that Vogue's younger look
made it too similar to Elle, which had staked out that
territory first. At the same time, they contend, Vogue
abandoned its base of older, monied fashion matrons, who are
now being wooed by older-skewing books such as Mirabella and
Lear's.
   "For so long, they were clearly the fashion arbiter, but
they vacated that. They went after the younger, hotter
segment and left those high-end fashion dollars behind," says
Paul DuCharme, vice president and director of print media at
Grey Advertising. "They had developed a franchise -- the
doyenne, the arbiter, the class of the field -- and they just
gave it up."
   Verne Westerberg, Vogue's publisher, says the ad decline
has nothing to do with Ms. Wintour's reign. Advertising
"isn't her job. Her job is to help circulation," he says. He
notes that Vogue increased its rate base to 1.1 million last
fall from one million, and says actual circulation for the
first half will be even higher.
   Still, the Conde Nast publication remains the nation's
largest fashion magazine and carries by far the most ad
pages. Mr. Westerberg concedes that this year, Vogue will be
down from the 3,320 ad pages it ran in 1989, which in turn
was flat from 1988. But he says that the slip for the year
was expected, saying: "We're alive and well financially."
   He says the decline is due mainly to the troubles at the
nation's big retailers, which in turn have scared away small
manufacturers who used to advertise in Vogue. The magazine
may also be suffering because it isn't as willing to
negotiate its ad rates as its competitors.
   For her part, Ms. Wintour dismisses ad executives'
complaints, saying that anyone who confuses Vogue with Elle
"obviously doesn't read either of the magazines. We're more
sophisticated than Elle; we take a totally different
approach." She notes that Vogue includes features "rather
than just pretty pictures," and that it explores social
issues such as abortion and adoption, while Elle usually
sticks to fashion. Couture designers, along with the older,
monied crowd they serve, Ms. Wintour adds, "love the
magazine."
   Not surprisingly, Elle's publisher, Anne Sutherland Fuchs,
begs to differ. Vogue has "gone more mass" by increasing its
circulation and putting celebrities like Madonna and Ivana
Trump on its cover next to headlines such as "Dress for
Less," she says. Elle, on the other hand, is gunning for a
more affluent audience; it even rejects mass advertisers like
tampon companies in a bid to appear more upscale. Ms. Fuchs
makes no bones about who she thinks is taking the right road.
   After a poor first quarter, she says, Elle has seen
advertising increases in each of its issues since March, and
ad pages will be on the rise at least through October, with
the exception of September, which will be flat. "We decided
we didn't want to be fatally middled," Ms. Fuchs says. "We
have made some decisions which have proven to be correct
decisions."

   Saatchi Wins New Business
                                                                                                       

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.'s flagship London agency won new
business assignments from a variety of clients totaling about
#20 million ($36 million). The wins should restore the shop's
leadership in new-business rankings among British ad
agencies.
   Britain's biggest agency, known informally as Charlotte
Street because of its address, led the pack for the past
three years. But the agency had sunk to seventh place so far
this year due to an overall advertising slump and new-client
skittishness about the parent company's financial ills.
   Yesterday, a Saatchi official said the agency had won the
Royal Insurance PLC account, valued at #10 million. The
agency was also awarded additional business from three
existing clients: Swiss watch maker Swatch, LA Gear and Racal
Telecom PLC.

   REVIVED JINGLE: In a new TV campaign for Rice-a-Roni
beginning next week, Golden Grain Co. will revive its "San
Francisco Treat" theme. Golden Grain used that theme in the
1960s and 1970s. Goldberg Moser O'Neill, Golden Grain's ad
agency, put a spin on the old tune, though, and the
revitalized jingle has a more contemporary beat. Golden Grain
said it decided to bring back the jingle after consumer
research indicated high "awareness and equities" associated
with the theme.
                                                                                                       

   TIME: Time magazine said it will publish a special issue
on "the changing role of women in society" this October.
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. will be the sole advertiser in the
issue. Time called the Sears deal a multimillion-dollar
advertising program.
