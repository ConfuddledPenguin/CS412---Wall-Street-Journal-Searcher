   Tokyo stocks finished higher in light and non-focused
trading, with the Nikkei Index fluctuating largely because of
index-linked trading, observers said.
   In London, stocks ended moderate activity with prices just
off the day's lows. Traders said sentiment was mixed with the
pound's decline providing support but economic fundamentals
still overshadowing the market.

   Tokyo's market lacked investors' enthusiasm as interest
rates in the bond market showed little sign of declining,
despite the yen's continued strength against the dollar,
traders said.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 281.14 points to
32575.32 Thursday, finishing just below the intraday high. In
early trading in Tokyo Friday, the index advanced another
182.66 points to 32757.98.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
430 million shares, up from 386.9 million shares Wednesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 503 to 421,
while 197 issues remained unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price
Index of all issues in the first section rose 2.67 points, or
0.11%, to 2354.24.
   The second section index was up 11.97 points, or 0.27%, to
4418.71. Volume was estimated at 35 million shares, down from
39.7 million shares Wednesday.
   The Nikkei Index, which climbed above 32500 in the
midmorning, declined as low as 32266 late in the afternoon as
bond prices softened, traders said.
   The index jumped about 300 points during the last 30
minutes of trading. But traders attributed the advance to
buying linked to the July options trading that expired
yesterday.
   "The gain was solely technical. The sentiment wasn't
strong," said Takashi Hayano, a futures and options trader at
Dai-Ichi Securities.
   Large-capital shares that firmed Wednesday on the yen's
advance fell back as investors took profits, judging that the
strengthening of the yen is unlikely to pull down interest
rates, traders said.
   Shipbuilders, electric utilities and largesize
construction companies ended lower.
   Investors went after the shares of companies that are
considered likely to maintain strong earnings prospects
regardless of changes in exchange rates and interest rates,
Mr. Murai said.
   High-tech shares advanced briskly because of strong
earnings outlooks.
   Sony was up 100 yen to 8800 yen (67 cents to $59.36).
Kyocera soared 220 yen to 9000 yen. TDK gained 90 yen to 7440
yen, while Fanucrose 90 yen to 7550 yen.
   In London, sterling's decline in early trading provided
encouragement for the overseas earners. But not all of the
stocks in the sector benefited from the pound's easing, as
some came under pressure from profit-takers after Wednesday's
rally on a sharply lower pound.
   Wall Street's firm performance provided considerable
support late in London's trading day.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
at 2370.5, up 10 points, after gaining as much as 25.8
points. The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 7.3 points to
1870.4.
   Volume rose modestly, with 460.6 million issues traded
compared with 449.1 million shares Wednesday.
   One of the main corporate highlights was Hawker Siddeley
issuing a profit warning for 1990, saying its earnings "will
fall short" of 1989 figures. The electrical and mechanical
engineering concern had 1989 pretax profit of #202.1 million
($364 million) on sales of #2.15 billion. The stock fell 62
pence to 548 pence.
   One dealer said one reason for the stock's decline was the
placement of a chunk of shares by broker Cazenove.
   Rank Organisation eased 48 pence to 789 pence. The
communications and entertainment concern said pretax profit
for the six months ended May 12 increased 24%, though the
company forecast growing difficulties stemming from poor
economic conditions in the U.K. and the U.S.
   Great Universal Stores gained 20 pence to #10.63, as
investors bought stock ahead of the company's results, widely
anticipated to be disclosed next week.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Zurich,
Brussels, Milan, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Madrid. Frankfurt
closed mixed. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   And shares ended higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore
and Wellington, and lower in Manila, Seoul, and Taipei.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
