   WASHINGTON -- Roman Catholics and blacks appear to be
paying little heed to the calls of some of their leaders
these days, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll.
   The survey found that Catholic voters overwhelmingly
oppose excommunicating Catholic politicians who take
positions favoring abortion rights. Seventy-one percent of
those Catholics polled said such politicians shouldn't be
excommunicated, while only 16% said they should.

   Meanwhile, efforts by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and others to
adopt the term "African-American" for blacks have yet to
catch fire. Among the blacks polled, 59% said they prefer to
be referred to as black, while 25% prefer African-American.
And 70% said there has been little debate over the issue
among people they know; 27% said the topic has been widely
discussed.
