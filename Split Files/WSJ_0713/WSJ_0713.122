   Computer Associates International Inc. said revenue for
the first quarter ended June 30 dropped significantly from
the year-earlier period and that earnings probably suffered.
   As a result, the giant software company's stock plummeted
in extremely heavy trading, losing almost 40% of its value.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Computer
Associates shares lost $6.25, to close at $10.25.

   Based on about 186.1 million shares outstanding, the
company's indicated market value fell to $1.91 billion from
$3.07 billion. Volume was 7,955,600 shares -- more than
changed hands in the entire month of April.
   Computer Associates, once one of the highest of the
high-flyers in the computer industry, hit the wall a year ago
because of trouble handling a large acquisition. In recent
months, the company had reported that those problems were
behind it and restored at least some of its credibility. But
yesterday's announcement will raise again all the old
questions about how real some of the company's growth was and
whether the company was using its frequent acquisitions to
hide fundamental flaws in its strategy.
   In a conference call to Wall Street analysts, Computer
Associates President Anthony Wang indicated that the firm
likely won't report a loss for the quarter. But analysts said
he refused to quantify the surprising revenue drop and was
unsure about the reasons behind it.
   Mr. Wang's tentative explanation for the drop, analysts
said, wasn't very convincing. He said Computer Associates'
sales force spent too much time explaining a new software
strategy and not enough time selling actual software.
   In April, Computer Associates unveiled a plan to bring
order to the hodge-podge of products it accumulated during a
recent acquisition binge. But that plan will take several
years to play out, so passing up current sales opportunities
to explain it doesn't make much sense.
   Analysts said Mr. Wang also speculated that the buying
cycle in the software industry is getting longer -- at least
for firms such as Computer Associates, which made its name
selling software that helps mainframes run more efficiently
but which is trying to use its influence with customers to
sell other mainframe software, such as data bases.
   Despite this quarter's disappointment, the company said it
intends to maintain profit growth during its fiscal year,
which ends March 31, even if revenue fails to meet
expectations.
   "We . . . believe that our strategies for revenue growth
are correct, and, at this time, we continue to be optimistic
about the year as a whole," Mr. Wang said in a statement.
   For the quarter ended June 30, Wall Street analysts had
projected revenue growth of 3% to 6% from the year-earlier
$303 million, and earnings of 10 cents to 15 cents a share,
up from $10.7 million, or six cents a share.
   For all of fiscal 1990, Computer Associates' net income
rose 21% to $157.8 million, or 85 cents a share. Revenue
increased 5.2% to $1.3 billion.
   When those results were announced in May, Mr. Wang said
the firm had finally started to recover from problems in
merging with Cullinet Software Inc., acquired in September.
   Software sales stalled soon after that acquisition was
announced early in 1989, as customers waited to see how
Computer Associates would handle the overlap in the two
companies' product lines. Those problems brought to a head
existing concerns about the firm, sending the stock on a
slide from which it finally seemed to be recovering in recent
months.
