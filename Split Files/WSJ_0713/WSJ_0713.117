   DETROIT -- The 10 major U.S. auto makers planned to build
72,982 cars this week, a 32.2% increase from the 55,188 cars
built a year earlier.
   Ford Motor Co. said all its assembly plants except one
will reopen Monday following its annual two-week summer
break. The Dearborn, Mich., production facility that builds
the Mustang will be idled an additional week because of a
"shortage of dealer orders." About 2,100 workers will be
affected.

   U.S. car output was virtually unchanged in June, and truck
and bus production increased 4.4% from the year-earlier
month.
