   WILMINGTON, Mass. -- Denning Mobile Robotics Inc. said it
agreed with closely held Windsor Industries Inc., Englewood,
Colo., to complete development of a self-navigating robot
scrubber for cleaning commercial buildings.
   Denning also said Windsor will fund development of a
vacuuming robot. It said Windsor could buy thousands of the
vehicles over the next five years. An official of Windsor
said it hopes to start marketing the robot scrubbers next
year. The companies declined to disclose financial details.
