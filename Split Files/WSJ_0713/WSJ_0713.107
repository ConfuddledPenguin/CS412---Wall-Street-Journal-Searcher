   LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp. said it agreed to buy Amoco
Production Co.'s 62.5% interest in the Chakachatna Group of
oil and gas properties in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   The Chakachatna Group owns two platforms in the Granite
Point field and two in the Middle Ground Shoal field, which
now have a gross production rate of about 5,100 barrels of
oil a day. Unocal estimated that the fields have more than 11
million barrels of developed oil reserves, with more
available for development.

   A spokesman for Amoco Production in Denver said the sale
is "part of our longterm strategy of consolidating our
producing operations geologically and geographically." Though
the unit of Chicago-based Amoco Corp. has considerable
holdings in Alaska, including a 10% stake in the Endicott
field on the North Slope, "The Cook Inlet properties
represent the only Amoco-operated production in Alaska," the
spokesman said.
   Amoco Production is the current operator for the group.
Unocal is expected to assume this role, following a vote by
the other group partners, Chevron Corp., San Francisco, and
Texaco Inc., White Plains, N.Y.
   The transaction, which is subject to certain consents,
including a waiting period required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act on antitrust issues, is expected to be completed within
the next several weeks, a Unocal spokesman said.
