   HOLLYWOOD -- D. Constantine Conte lives in two worlds.
   One is filled with the big money and beautiful people of
Hollywood, where Mr. Conte, a six-foot, 200-pound man,
hobnobs with movie stars and movie makers, such as Nick Nolte
and Dino DiLaurentiis. In this world, Mr. Conte, known as
Dino to friends, is a successful Hollywood producer, whose
credits include "48 Hours" and "Conan the Barbarian." He's
the man who co-produced "Another 48 Hours," the just-released
sequel starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte. And he's the man
who, friends say, is generous and trustworthy, who always has
a kind word for a secretary and whose mother lives at his
home. "There will be a seat reserved in Valhalla for Dino
Conte," says John Milius, the movie director.

   But then there's the other world. In this one, Dino Conte
is a convicted felon and onetime confederate of a reputed New
York City mobster. He also has been the subject of periodic
surveillance by law enforcement authorities worried that mob
infiltration of Hollywood is increasing. Their internal
reports allege that Mr. Conte has had associations with
reputed mob figures.
   Mr. Conte declined to be interviewed about his past or the
allegations about him. His lawyer, Allan Sigel, would only
communicate by letter. He says his client is a "respected
member of the movie industry" and the victim of
"misinformation and false statements of fact."
   Yet the suggestion that Mr. Conte hasn't associated with
criminal figures is repeatedly challenged by law enforcement
reports, business records and, in at least one case, by a
former criminal himself -- Dennis Tinerino. Mr. Tinerino was
convicted of conspiracy in 1978, about the same time he
shared an office address with Mr. Conte in Beverly Hills.
While Mr. Conte's lawyer says Mr. Conte doesn't know the man,
Mr. Tinerino remembers otherwise: "I used to see Dino all the
time," Mr. Tinerino says in an interview. "We used to hang
out together at Pips Club," a Los Angeles restaurant and
social club. Mr. Conte also tried helping him with a
movie-related business venture, he says.
   Mr. Conte hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing since he
moved west. He also went to the police in 1982 to assure them
he doesn't have any ties to the mob. At the same time, he
complained to the police about what he felt were untrue
statements they had made about him, according to a 1984
police report.
   Nonetheless, law enforcement officials have been
interested in his activities for years. What their
examinations have revealed, as recently as 1988, are
suspected connections -- some direct, some merely indirect --
between the well-known producer and organized crime figures,
according to law enforcement officials and internal
documents.
   Police concern about mob infiltration of Hollywood has a
long history. Back in the 1930s, the Chicago mob, which
infiltrated Hollywood's unions, extorted hundreds of
thousands of dollars from studios in return for promises of
labor peace, according to "Dark Victory," a book on the
entertainment industry by Dan Moldea. In the 1940s a top
industry official and two labor leaders were sent to jail for
the mob-related payoffs, and, in the years since, scandals
involving organized crime have periodically hit Hollywood.
   As for Mr. Conte, he has drawn police attention because of
his success, his past and the company that authorities say he
has kept. For instance, a 1988 Los Angeles police department
report asserts that the movie maker has a "close association"
with Vincent "Jimmy Blue Eyes" Alo, who, according to a
report submitted to the U.S. Senate by the New York Police
Department, is a reputed top member of New York's powerful
Genovese crime family. A 1983 Los Angeles district attorney's
office internal report identifies Mr. Conte as a suspected
"associate" of the Genovese family who reports to Mr. Alo.
And a 1984 Los Angeles police report says that, in his
meeting with police officers, Mr. Conte admitted to
"numerous" meetings with Mr. Alo but said they were simply to
discuss doing a movie or novel about Mr. Alo.
   However, Mr. Sigel, Mr. Conte's lawyer, says his client
has "never attended a meeting with a Mr. Alo" or been a
"business associate." Mr. Alo couldn't be located for comment
and a lawyer who has in the past represented him declined to
comment.
   William Jordan, a private investigator who says he has
worked on movie projects with Mr. Conte and who has in the
past helped the producer try to counter allegations about mob
connections, says in an interview that Mr. Conte isn't in
business with mobsters. He adds, though, that Mr. Conte has
met with suspected "low-level" mob figures. "He told me he
was just meeting with neighborhood friends from his
childhood," says Mr. Jordan, who adds that he advised the
producer to stop seeing those friends and believes Mr. Conte
followed that advice.
   Mr. Jordan also adds that his familiarity with Mr. Conte
goes back only to when the two met on a movie project in the
early- to mid-1970s. What happened before that, he isn't
entirely sure. "I don't know much about his past," he says.
   There are also indications that at least part of the
movie-industry establishment is aware of law enforcement
officials' interest in Mr. Conte. Several years ago,
investigators for the Los Angeles county district attorney
privately warned an outside attorney for Paramount Pictures
about Mr. Conte, according to a person familiar with the
meeting. Around the same time, Michael Eisner, then
Paramount's president, was contacted by police
organized-crime detectives who wanted to discuss Mr. Conte.
Mr. Eisner is now chairman of Walt Disney Co.
   Mr. Eisner, through a spokesman, says he only barely
recalls meeting with police and hasn't any reason to be
suspicious of Mr. Conte. Similarly, a Paramount spokeswoman
says her studio hasn't any reason to think Mr. Conte is
anything other than a respected movie producer.
   Mr. Conte keeps a relatively low profile. Studio releases
about his movies offer scant information about him, and even
his friends say they know little about his private life. "In
all the years I've worked with him, we haven't talked about
his past," says Kurt Neumann, an executive at Warner Bros.
   But from what can be pieced together from law enforcement
records and dozens of interviews with police, friends and
associates, Mr. Conte's biography goes something like this:
   A Greek-American, Mr. Conte was born in 1933 in New York
City. In one letter, Mr. Sigel, the attorney, says Mr. Conte
was "educated in Greek theater and drama," but didn't
elaborate.
   In his early life, Mr. Conte sometimes used the name Dino
Harris. As Dino Harris, he began working in the late 1950s at
various Manhattan bars. Roughly during this period, Mr. Conte
got to know Salvatore "Sally Burns" Granello, who is
identified in law enforcment reports as a member of the
Lucchese crime family. Mr. Conte is identified in law
enforcement documents as a suspected bodyguard for Mr.
Granello.
   In 1964, Mr. Conte and Mr. Granello were charged in New
York state court in Mineola, N.Y., with the attempted
extortion of a Long Island jukebox distributor. According to
New York state court records in the case, Mr. Granello and
some associates beat the businessman's wife with a pistol. A
Nassau County police officer, who reviewed the court records,
says Mr. Conte apparently wasn't present for the beating.
   Mr. Conte pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to
commit extortion and was sentenced to six months in the
county jail. Mr. Granello was convicted and sentenced to 18
months in jail. But Mr. Granello would soon meet a savage
end: In 1970, he was found dead in the trunk of a car in
lower Manhattan, garrotted and shot four times in the head.
   Separately that same year, Mr. Conte also encountered new
trouble. Along with four others, he was indicted by a federal
grand jury in New York in connection with the interstate
theft of $271,000 in traveler's checks. Mr. Conte and his
co-defendants were part of a broader, nationwide securities
theft ring with ties to organized crime, according to
testimony presented at a 1971 Senate hearing by the confessed
leader of another theft ring, and according to materials
prepared by the staff of the Senate permanent subcommittee on
investigations.
   Mr. Conte again pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count and
in 1972 was sentenced to three years at a maximum-security
federal prison in Atlanta. He was released March 14, 1974,
with time off for good behavior.
   Around this time, Mr. Conte apparently began his film
career. A 1984 press release from Universal Pictures about a
Conte movie says Mr. Conte had been in the "production end of
film making for the past 14 years."
   An early patron was film maker  Dino DeLaurentiis, say
friends and associates of Mr. Conte. Larry Gleason, a
Paramount official, says Mr. DeLaurentiis once told him that
he and Mr. Conte first worked together on the 1972
DeLaurentiis movie "The Valachi Papers," a true-life story of
a mobster turned government witness. Mr. DeLaurentiis "didn't
say what Conte was doing on the movie," Mr. Gleason adds. Mr.
DeLaurentiis declined to be interviewed.
   By the late 1970s, Mr. Conte was working out of Mr.
DeLaurentiis's Beverly Hills office, according to a 1977
police report and movie-industry people who saw him there. On
a 1978 DeLaurentiis movie, "Brink's Job," Mr. Conte "was like
the troubleshooter . . . keeping an eye on things for Mr.
DeLaurentiis," recalls Domingo Rodriguez, a United Scenic
Artists union official who says he dealt with Mr. Conte.
   Law enforcement reports also assert that Mr. Conte has
been a close associate of an actor named Jude Farese, and was
connected through him to his brother Thomas Farese, who,
according to a 1988 report by the Senate permanent
subcommitee on investigations, is a member of New York's
Colombo crime family. A 1978 Los Angeles police report, for
instance, says Mr. Conte was the "exclusive" driver of a
Cadillac leased in the name of Jude Farese at a Florida
address used by Thomas Farese for a now-defunct company he
called Olympic Film Productions. The report says police
suspected Mr. Conte was helping run Olympic's Los Angeles
office for a time.
   Mr. Conte's lawyer says Mr. Conte has never heard of
Olympic Film. The producer didn't respond to an inquiry from
this newspaper about his alleged contact with the Fareses.
   Jude Farese, through his agent, declined to be interviewed
about Mr. Conte. "He says he knows where your questions are
going to lead and isn't interested in talking about it," the
agent says.
   Thomas Farese is currently in a Florida federal prison for
conspiracy to distribute marijuana. He couldn't be reached
for comment.
   Then there's Mr. Tinerino, who went to jail for conspiracy
and whom Mr. Conte, through his lawyer, says he doesn't know.
According to Los Angeles police reports and California state
corporation records, which list business addresses, Mr. Conte
had the same office address as Mr. Tinerino, who was a
principal in a large out-call massage service.
   In 1978, Mr. Tinerino pleaded guilty in a Los Angeles
state court to conspiracy to force acts of prostitution and
served four months in the county jail. Today he is in the
fitness-equipment business in the Los Angeles area. He says
that, though he shared an office address with Mr. Conte, it
was for separate companies and that Mr. Conte wasn't involved
in the out-call business. "He was very nice to me," says Mr.
Tinerino. He adds that Mr. Conte tried to help him market
sound equipment to the movie business and that the producer
even introduced him to Mr. DeLaurentiis. "I never asked him
how he got into the movie business and he never talked about
what he did before the movie business," says Mr. Tinerino.
   Mr. Conte's jump into the big time in motion pictures came
in 1982, when he received his first producer credits, on
three movies. Two were DeLaurentiis productions, "Conan the
Barbarian" and "Fighting Back." The third, "48 Hours," was a
Paramount production.
   The Los Angeles County district attorney seemed
particularly interested in Mr. Conte's involvement in "48
Hours." A person familiar with the matter says the district
attorney's office was concerned how someone with Mr. Conte's
background could gain such a prominent role on a major movie.
   Two district attorney investigators eventually met with
Alan Croll, an outside attorney for Paramount, to deliver
what one person familiar with the meeting calls "a friendly
warning" to the studio about Mr. Conte. Over lunch at the
Playboy Club, the district attorney's men laid out Mr.
Conte's criminal past and suggested Paramount might want to
do its own review of the producer, says this person. Mr.
Croll thanked them for the information but never got back to
the investigators, this person adds. Mr. Croll declines to
comment on the meeting.
   The movie "48 Hours" would prove a big hit for Mr. Conte
and for its co-star, Nick Nolte. By all accounts, Mr. Nolte
and Mr. Conte are very close friends, and the producer at
times acts as an unofficial agent for the actor. Matt Cimber,
a local television producer, says Mr. Conte once told him,
"if I ever got anything good for Nick {in the way of scripts}
to get it over to him right away."
   During these years, Mr. Conte was also getting to know
people such as Donald Simpson. Mr. Simpson is currently one
of Hollywood's hottest producers, thanks to big-hit credits
such as "Top Gun," "Flashdance" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Mr.
Simpson was the head of production at Paramount in the early
1980s, and it was back then that he allegedly went to Mr.
Conte seeking help in a dispute with a man named Martin
Bacow.
   The 68-year-old Mr. Bacow freely admits to having known
organized-crime figures for most of his life, though he
insists he has never been involved in illegal activities. He
has also been under federal investigation over whether he
used organized-crime and union ties to extort money from
movie companies in return for labor peace -- a charge he
denies.
   Mr. Bacow says in an interview that in the early 1980s he
was doing work at Paramount when he and Mr. Simpson had a
falling out over business issues. Mr. Bacow claims that Mr.
Simpson was sufficiently worried that he sought protection
from Mr. Conte.
   Mr. Bacow says he first learned of the alleged meeting
between Messrs. Simpson and Conte from two members of the Los
Angeles police organized-crime unit he knew. "They told me
they had gone to see Simpson and that he admitted it. He said
he was afraid I was going to have him killed," says Mr.
Bacow, who adds that the fear was unfounded.
   One of those police officials, David Powers, confirms that
he and his partner did interview Mr. Simpson and, separately,
Mr. Eisner, who was Mr. Simpson's boss at the time. Mr.
Powers says police department rules preclude him from
discussing either meeting. Mr. Simpson, through a spokesman,
declined to be interviewed. Mr. Eisner, through a spokesman,
says that he "vaguely" recalls the meeting and that "it had
something to do with Mr. Simpson and a threat."
   Mr. Bacow says that, in a later confrontation, Mr. Simpson
admitted to him that he went to Mr. Conte for help. Two
people who say they witnessed that confrontation essentially
back up Mr. Bacow's account. Through his lawyer, Mr. Conte
says such a meeting with Mr. Simpson never occurred.
   Word of law-enforcement interest in Mr. Conte appeared in
a June 1983 Los Angeles Times article headlined "Police
Investigate Producer; He Calls It Mistaken Identity." In his
interview in the Times, Mr. Conte suggested there must be
another man named Conte with the criminal associations. The
Times quoted Mr. Conte as saying, "I'm not part of no Mafia.
Ask anybody you want in this town. I haven't done nothing to
nobody."
   The article also quoted Mr. Simpson as saying that Mr.
Conte had been instrumental in getting Mr. Nolte for "48
Hours" and quoted Mr. Eisner as saying Mr. Conte appeared to
be "in the mainstream of the motion picture business."
   Mr. Jordan, the private investigator, says the Times
article was a setback to Mr. Conte's career. The studios told
Mr. Conte "they felt they couldn't deal with him until the
controversy died down," says Mr. Jordan. When it did, the
deals started up again, he adds.
   In one of his letters to this newspaper, Mr. Sigel, the
producer's attorney, says the Journal's inquiries in recent
months are also damaging Mr. Conte's career. Mr. Conte has
been put on an industry "blacklist" where "his access to
production and distribution outlets has been curtailed and in
some instances denied," Mr. Sigel says. The lawyer didn't
elaborate.
   Yet if Hollywood does have Mr. Conte on a blacklist, it
doesn't appear to have affected his career. Recently, Daily
Variety columnist Army Archerd wrote that Mr. Conte has three
new movies in the works. Disney would distribute one.
Paramount is reportedly considering distributing another. And
Mr. Nolte would star in all three.
