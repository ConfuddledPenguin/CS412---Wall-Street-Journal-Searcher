   MINNEAPOLIS -- Cray Research Inc.'s president and chief
operating officer, Marcelo A. Gumucio, is leaving the
supercomputer maker because of disagreements with the
chairman on how to carry out a strategy they jointly
developed.
   "This wasn't spurred by an event," said John A. Rollwagen,
chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Rollwagen said he
decided Mr. Gumucio should go because their different
management styles were "creating confusion" within the ranks.
"We're on track -- in total agreement about our strategy.
It's the style issue that makes it rather squishy."

   "Style" is a key word at Cray, which has painstakingly
created a work environment designed to foster creativity in a
highly competitive leading-edge technology. Seymour R. Cray,
its flannel-shirted founder, started the company in the woods
of western Wisconsin after fleeing the bureaucracy of a large
company.
   As the Japanese shortened the U.S. lead in supercomputing,
Mr. Rollwagen apparently came to believe that the company
could ill afford delays because of what he called "mixed
signals" from top management. "We needed some clarity," he
said.
   The departure of Mr. Gumucio, 52 years old, is Cray's
third major personnel jolt in as many years. In 1987 Steve
Chen, the architect of Cray's best-selling machines, left in
a dispute over technical directions. Then, Mr. Cray left the
company last year, when his latest research project -- which
Mr. Gumucio and others saw as an increasing drain on company
resources -- was spun off.
   Yesterday Mr. Rollwagen, in an interview, drew a parallel
between the Chen and Gumucio departures; both men represented
challenges to the "Cray style." While Mr. Rollwagen practices
what he calls an "intuitive" style, he said Mr. Gumucio
represented a "more formal, structured approach" that the two
found increasingly in conflict.
   Last Monday, after they had been away for several weeks,
the two men got together and agreed that a change was
necessary, both said.
   Disputes with the boss aren't unusual, but Mr. Gumucio's
departure is. Although his resignation as an officer and
director was immediate, Mr. Gumucio spent much of yesterday
in his office, explaining to visitors the "philosophical
differences" that led to what he called an "irreconcilable
divorce." In an adjacent office, Mr. Rollwagen was doing the
same.
   The 49-year-old chairman said he would assume many of Mr.
Gumucio's duties, but has no immediate plans to name a
successor. "We don't have to have a president," he said.
   Mr. Gumucio was named president in November 1988, as
recognition of his success in leading Cray's marketing
efforts world-wide, and because his bottom-line orientation
was seen as helping the company cope with a period of slower
growth.
   Analysts credit Mr. Gumucio with convincing the company to
make a smaller, less expensive supercomputer so as to broaden
sales prospects. That machine is due out shortly. He also is
considered a key architect of Cray's effort to plug its
machines into more computer networks world-wide. Mr. Gumucio
takes credit as well for the decision to spin off Mr. Cray's
project.
   "We have a great strategy that we've carved out," Mr.
Gumucio said yesterday, contending it will take the company
into the 21st century. But differences over the timing of
those plans led to growing disagreements with Mr. Rollwagen,
he said. "I'm more of a pusher than John is," Mr. Gumucio
said. "He allows a little more time."
   Mr. Gumucio also was more demanding in holding the sales
force to quotas, and over such nuts-and-bolts issues as
compensation -- matters that eventually got back to Mr.
Rollwagen, who in recent months had been spending more time
making the rounds of the company.
   Gary P. Smaby, a Minneapolis-based supercomputer industry
consultant, said the management change "should say to
customers that the company has again indicated its intention
to stay on target." But he also predicted that Mr.
Rollwagen's "style will have to evolve to adapt to the
market."
   Mr. Gumucio said he has no plans to sell his Cray stock,
which amounted to 8,957 shares as of the most recent proxy
statement. Cray closed yesterday at $48, up 62.5 cents in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   A native of Bolivia, Mr. Gumucio is a naturalized U.S.
citizen. He joined Cray in 1983 from Northern Telecom Ltd.,
where he was executive vice president, marketing. Previously,
he worked for Memorex Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Corp.
