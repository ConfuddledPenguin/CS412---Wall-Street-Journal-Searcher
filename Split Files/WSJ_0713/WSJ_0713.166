   PARIS -- Bouygues S.A. said it won a contract valued at
one billion francs ($179.9 million) to build eight factories
in Thailand for a local developer.
   The public works and construction group said the factories
are part of the first phase in the construction of a town
called Muang Thong Thani between Bangkok and its airport.
