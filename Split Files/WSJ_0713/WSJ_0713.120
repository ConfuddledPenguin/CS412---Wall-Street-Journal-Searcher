   D. Constantine Conte has, in previous years, insisted that
allegations against him are really just a case of mistaken
identity. There are other men in Los Angeles named Dino
Conte, he told the Los Angeles Times in 1983, and one of them
must have the unsavory connections.
   Mr. Conte didn't make this claim with this newspaper in
his correspondence through his lawyer, but the "double"
theory has made the rounds in Hollywood. "There were two Dino
Contes," insists Kurt Neumann, an executive at Warner Bros.
and a friend of the producer. The "innuendo" about Mr. Conte
is "well known" and is widely dismissed, he says.

   Mr. Conte's claim isn't entirely frivolous. Law
enforcement authorities have at least on one occasion
confused him with a Dino Carmelo Conte, and in one report, as
a preventive measure, included photos and other information
about the two men to make sure investigators kept them
straight.
   However, law enforcement officers also have noted in
police reports that the ex-con Dino Conte and the producer
Dino Conte are one and the same. They also say that
surveillance and other investigative work has tied the
producer to suspected organized crime figures.
   Moreover, at the request of this newspaper, Bruce R.
Greenwood, a member of the American Board of Forensic
Document Examiners and a frequent expert witness in trials
involving document analysis, examined several handwriting
samples of Mr. Conte's, including a letter he wrote while in
prison in the Atlanta Federal Penetentiary and samples he has
written while a producer in Hollywood. Mr. Greenwood said
that based on several factors -- the slant of letters in
words, their design, their proportional relationship to each
other -- he concluded the same person wrote all the samples.
"All of the features of the writing match," he says.
   It is notable, too, that the prison file for the criminal
Mr. Conte lists the same date of birth -- June 25, 1933 -- as
the producer's current California driver's license. His 1964
arrest record on file with the Nassau County, N.Y., police,
which also notes the same birth date, indicates that Mr.
Conte was using the name Dino Harris at the time, and that
his mother's first name was Thelma. A woman named Thelma
Harris lives at the producer's address in west Los Angeles,
according to 1988 records on file with the Los Angeles County
registrar of voters.
