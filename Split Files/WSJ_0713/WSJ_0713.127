   Action Auto Rental Inc., Cleveland, said it expects to
report a second-quarter loss of between 52 cents and 56 cents
a share.
   In the year-earlier quarter, ended June 30, the auto
rental company reported net income of 16 cents a share. The
company expects to report its results July 31.

   In addition, the company said it will sell its leasing
division, which has generated less than 5% of annual revenue.
   The loss reflects an operating loss of 16 to 20 cents per
share and one-time pretax charges of $5.8 million, or 36
cents per share after tax. Most of the charges will cover
increased insurance-related costs.
   Action Auto said its second-quarter revenue was lower
because demand for rental cars outpaced the company's ability
to rebuild its fleet of cars.
   The company said its continuing program to cut costs will
include consolidation of 20 to 25 offices into existing
offices during the rest of the year. The number of vehicles
per office will also increase.
