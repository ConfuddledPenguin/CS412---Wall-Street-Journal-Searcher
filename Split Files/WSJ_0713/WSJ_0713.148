   "Money-market funds assets, especially those held in
individual accounts, rebounded sharply, more than making up
the losses of the preceding week," said Jacob Dreyer, vice
president and chief economist at the institute. Money-fund
assets were revised for the previous week to $382.73 billion.
The reported decrease in assets of $2.24 billion was revised
to a decrease of $2.20 billion.
