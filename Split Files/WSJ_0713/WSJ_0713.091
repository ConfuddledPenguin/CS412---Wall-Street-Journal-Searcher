   TOKYO -- Toys "R" Us Inc. is accelerating its efforts to
crack the Japanese market.
   A spokesman for McDonalds Co. (Japan), which owns 20% of
the Toys "R" Us operation in Japan, said the toy retailer
intends to launch two more stores next year, bringing the
number of outlets it currently plans to open to four.

   The spokesman said Toys "R" Us will open stores in the
fall of 1991 in Sagamihara, near Tokyo, and in Fukuoka, a
city of 1.2 million people on the southern island of Kyushu.
   The company's plans represent a test case for American
retailers in trying to overcome the regulatory obstacles that
have slowed foreign entry into the Japanese market.
   Under pressure from the U.S., the Japanese government has
agreed to relax regulations that give small retailers
considerable power to block or delay the opening of stores
larger than about 5,400 square feet -- both foreign and
Japanese. In May, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry placed an 18-month limit on the process. In
addition, Japan has assured the U.S. government that it would
further lower the limit to 12 months.
   Encouraged by the looser regulations, Britain's Virgin
Atlantic Group intends to open several compact-disk and
cassette-tape stores in a joint venture with Marui Co., a
major Japanese retailer.
   Toys "R" Us had already said it would open two stores in
1993, and said it hopes to open as many as 100 stores in
Japan in the next decade.
