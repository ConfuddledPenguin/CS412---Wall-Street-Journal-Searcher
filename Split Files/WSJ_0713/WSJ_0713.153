   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. Mario Cuomo signed legislation
designed to restrict the use and sale of ozone-depleting
chemicals that are widely used in refrigeration systems, air
conditioners and fire extinguishers.
   The new law restricts and, in some cases, bans the sale of
chlorofluorocarbons and halons. Both have been found to
contribute to the depletion of the earth's ozone layer and to
add to global warming. The ozone layer protects the earth
from dangerous ultraviolet rays of the sun that can cause
skin cancer, eye cataracts and other problems.

   Chlorofluorocarbons are coolants that are commonly used in
refrigeration systems and air conditioners. Under the new
law, CFCs will have to be recaptured and recycled when
large-scale refrigeration systems and mobile air conditioners
are serviced. CFCs will also have to be recaptured when
equipment that uses them is disposed of.
   In addition, the new law bans the sale of residential fire
extinguishers that use halons and the sale of CFCs or
coolants in 14-ounce cans. The restrictions will be phased in
during the next two years.
   Gov. Cuomo said that, while the new law was a good
measure, it does not go far enough toward eliminating the use
of the chemicals -- a move that would be much better for the
environment.
