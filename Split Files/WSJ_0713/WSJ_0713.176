   NEW YORK -- Just when investors were ready to accept what
they expected to be a steady monetary policy, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan surprised the bond market yesterday
by saying the Fed stood poised to ease credit conditions.
   Not only is a statement by a Fed chief about the future
course of monetary policy close to unheard of, but Mr.
Greenspan's reasoning for the anticipated interest-rate move
represents a complete turnaround from previous statements.

   Mr. Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee, said the Fed may be preparing to push interest
rates lower in response to "cumulating evidence" it sees of a
credit crunch that could hurt the economy.
   Prior to Mr. Greenspan's comments, bond prices had been
falling. But "the bond market turned on a dime after the
Greenspan remarks," said Robert T. McGee, a senior vice
president at Tokai Bank Ltd.
   The benchmark 30-year bond jumped 3/4 point, a gain of
about $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,
fell to 8.49%.
   Although Mr. Greenspan's comments clearly helped the bond
market, some traders said the response by investors was
somewhat restrained due to skepticism that such an easing
will occur anytime soon.
   Some analysts aren't convinced that the Fed chief meant to
say that the central bank is preparing to push the federal
funds rate below its current 8.25% level. The federal funds
rate is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans.
   Rather, they contend, the Fed wants only to counter any
upward pressure on rates that may develop as a result of
bank-induced credit conditions.
   They note that following the July Federal Open Market
Committee meeting and the release of the June employment
report, the Fed, through its pattern of open market
operations, went out of its way to signal to the markets that
it had not changed policy.
   That was a big disappointment to many bond-market
participants who had been speculating for months that a Fed
easing was imminent. After the employment report, however,
they threw in the towel and began to believe that no easing
was in sight.
   The Fed "is prepared to ease, but not yet," said Michael
Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
   Bond prices had been down as much as 1/2 point during
morning trading, in part because of continued disappointment
that there wasn't much investor interest in Wednesday's
seven-year note auction despite the large amount of overall
bids.
   Also weighing on bond prices during early trading, dealers
and analysts said, was talk that a portfolio of up to $1
billion of bonds, composed mainly of corporate and
mortgage-backed securities, was sold by Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. to make room for some Resolution Funding Corp.
bonds that were purchased at Tuesday's auction. Refcorp is a
federal agency responsible for raising money to finance the
bailout of the savings and loan industry.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 21/32
to yield 8.49% compared with Wednesday's close of 101 29/32
to yield 8.56%. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of
102 13/32 to yield 8.49% compared with 101 29/32 to yield
8.56%.
   Short-term rates fell sharply. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.68% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.92%, down from 7.79% to yield
8.04% on Wednesday. The rate on six-month bills ended at
7.57% to yield 7.96%, down from 7.73% to yield 8.13% on
Wednesday.
   In the agency market, spreads between yields on Treasury
bonds and the Resolution Funding Corp. 30-year bonds that
were auctioned Tuesday narrowed amid talk that a few big
dealers with large positions were squeezing shorts. Shorts
are created when dealers and professional traders sell
securities they don't yet own.
   Apparently, a small number of big dealers ended up with a
large supply of Refcorp bonds after Tuesday's auction. That
forced dealers who were short of supply to scramble to buy
the bonds from dealers who had ample supply.
   The Refcorp bonds were auctioned at a spread of 0.39
percentage point above the Treasury's 8.75% 30-year bond and
trading late yesterday at a spread of 0.33 percentage point.
The bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of 100 18/32
to yield 8.82%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Bullish bond-market sentiment sparked a heavy influx of
new debt into the credit market yesterday with nearly $1.3
billion of securities priced.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Markets managed a majority of
yesterday's offerings, including $300 million of Province of
Nova Scotia 12-year debentures priced to yield 9.465%, $200
million of 15-year senior notes priced to yield 8.734% from
General Motors Corp.'s General Motors Acceptance Corp. unit,
and $75 million DeKalb Energy Co. 10-year notes priced to
yield 9.90%.
   Ford Holding Co., a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., also
launched a major debt offering, selling $552 million of
seven-year notes, which were priced to yield 9.275%.
   In the junk-bond market, investor confidence in Donald
Trump's prize Atlantic City casino, Trump Taj Mahal,
continued to erode after the release of disappointing
earnings for June.
   The casino confirmed that its average daily revenues for
the month of June were $1.16 million, much lower than the
$1.3 million a day analysts said the casino needs to break
even.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first mortgage bonds,
due in 1998, ended 1/2 point lower at 51. Other bonds issued
by Trump casinos were unchanged.
   In the broader market, junk bonds continued to firm in
moderate trading. Traders said prices rose about 1/4 point on
most issues. Most investment-grade bonds ended 3/8 point
firmer.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues finished up as much as 1/4 point.
   Market participants said that municipals followed U.S.
Treasury issues higher on Fed Chairman Greenspan's comments.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 were 3/8 point higher at 99 3/8 to
yield 7.24%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bonds ended weaker as short-term
interest rates continued to rise without protest from the
Bank of Japan and the dollar rebounded against the yen.
   Rates on Japanese bank deposits are now higher than bond
yields, which has resulted in investors selling bonds and
reinvesting the proceeds in money market funds.
   The Bank of Japan didn't try to cool down the interest
rate rise as it did on Tuesday and Wednesday. Meanwhile,
investors continue to speculate that the central bank will
boost the discount rate by the fall. The rate, which the Bank
of Japan charges on loans to banks, is 5.25%.
   In trading, Japan's benchmark 10-year bond ended at a
price of 86.67, down 0.28 point, to yield 7.265%. Rates on
new three-month certificates of deposit rose to 7.67%, up
from 7.61% two days earlier.
   (Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ somewhat from yields calculated for these
markets by U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the
semiannual compound measure to compare yields across
markets.)
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The mortgage securities posted modest gains, spurred by
the comments by Fed Chairman Greenspan.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities for July
delivery were up 11/32 at 99 16/32, July Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were up 10/32 at 98 3/4 and
July Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
were up 11/32 at 99 10/32.
