   The suggestion that one of the revenue raisers in the next
budget might be a transaction tax on tradeable instruments
has awakened in its opponents memories of President John F.
Kennedy's Interest Equalization Tax, probably the most
important (and wrongheaded) economic initiative of that
administration. The tax bore the fingerprints of able people
-- Douglas Dillion, Robert Roosa, Paul Volcker -- and the
problem they were trying to solve was both real and
troublesome. But the results were, literally, monstrous.
   Kennedy's problem was that interest rates were lower in
the U.S. than they were in Europe, while exchange rates
between the dollar and the European currencies had been set
in concrete. Europeans could therefore gain by borrowing
dollars in the U.S. and exchanging them for their own
currencies in their own countries. The foreign central banks
that would end up owning these dollars could use them to buy
gold, which the U.S. was officially but unhappily pledged to
sell to official purchasers for $35 an ounce. Or they could
make dollar-denominated loans to their own nationals, in
effect exporting their inflationary pressures to the U.S.

   The administration wanted to maintain the exchange value
of the dollar without raising interest rates. So, on July 18,
1963, Kennedy announced the "temporary" imposition of a 1%
tax on foreign borrowings (Canada and Japan were exempted).
The theory was that by making it more expensive for
foreigners to borrow dollars, the U.S. would persuade them to
borrow in other currencies.
   Those were the days of the imperial presidency. Taxes can
be imposed only by Congress, but the bills put in the
congressional hopper at Kennedy's request made the tax
effective as of the day of their introduction, freezing the
market. Nevertheless, foreigners kept borrowing dollars. But
they didn't borrow them in the U.S. They borrowed them from
the stashes of dollars held in Europe. A fairly large number
of dollars had been retained in Europe over the years -- by
Russians afraid that the Americans would forcibly settle
disputes over old lend-lease debts if U.S. authorities got
their hands on the cash, by Arabs concerned that their assets
could be frozen in the event of a Middle East war and by
businessmen who found it convenient to use the one currency
accepted everywhere in the Common Market.
   The Interest Equalization Tax created a difference between
the plain vanilla dollar and dollar held in Europe, or the
"Eurodollar." Deposits in Eurodollars were free of the
reserve requirements and deposit insurance premiums the U.S.
government imposed on plain vanilla dollars. And they yielded
better interest income, because lending them did not incur
the IET. The key question was whether American banks would be
permitted to accept Eurodollar deposits in their foreign
branches.
   Banking regulations said no. But according to Ron
Chernow's "The House of Morgan," J.P. Morgan's Walter Page
told then-Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Paul Volcker
that the old rules risked "the end of the American banking
system." "You will throw us out of Europe and Singapore and
Japan," Page said, and -- as he recalls -- Mr. Volcker
rewrote the regulations on the spot. The Euromarket was born.
   In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson, feeling increasing
pressure on the dollar from foreigners who wanted to exchange
their holdings for gold, instituted a voluntary Credit
Restraint Program. Everything backfired and the dollars kept
draining away. On New Year's Day, 1968, the president ordered
a mandatory Credit Restraint Program, plus limits on direct
investment abroad by U.S. companies.
   The more impediments on lending the U.S. government
devised, the higher the rates the Eurobanks (American and
foreign) offered for dollar deposits to be kept and lent
abroad. In the first six months of 1971, as Richard Nixon
hastened toward domestic price controls and the end of
American gold sales, European central banks put more than $10
billion into Euroaccounts in private banks.
   This gigantic dollar-denominated Euromarket became the
engine for recycling the money OPEC extorted for oil.
Eurodollars became the medium for the Third World debt that
still sits on the shoulders of our money-center banks like
the unshakable Old Man of the Sea who bedevilled Sinbad the
Sailor.
   Because of the Euromarket, the U.S. lost control of its
own money supply. As early as 1969, the Eurobanks discovered
that they could repatriate dollars to help American banks
fight back against a Federal Reserve money crunch. The only
anti-inflation weapon that remained in the Fed's arsenal was
interest rates. Twenty years later, the IET is still plaguing
financial markets: Aware of what the Euromarket did to U.S.
monetary sovereignty, the Japanese and Germans keep their
interest rates higher than they would otherwise be in order
to discourage the international use of the yen and the mark.
   Analogies can be drawn between the IET and the proposed
transaction tax, but the transaction tax of course has
domestic purposes. Its proponents hope to loosen the ties
between the futures markets and the stock market, which is a
consummation devoutly to be wished. Properly executed, it
might help level the playing field between the tax-exempt
institution and the tax-paying trader who is being driven
from U.S. markets, reduce the amount of trading against the
customer that now disfigures agency relationships on Wall
Street and increase the influence of the individual investor
with his higher time horizon. If the tax were applied at the
Depository Trust Corporation, where the ownership of shares
is transferred, the markets could not escape overseas.
   European governments are hastening to reduce or eliminate
their transfer taxes, essentially to facilitate the index
arbitrage business-innocent academics have made fashionable
everywhere. But some of these steps may well be reconsidered
in the light of the obvious manipulation of the London stock
market by the futures players there two weeks ago.
   The history of the IET does serve as a warning that when
the government makes a mistake, the mistake can reverberate
for generations. The proposal to tax futures transactions,
for example, would drive significant markets overseas,
because these stateless, standardized contracts have no
ownership component and can be cleared and settled in the
mid-Atlantic. Especially in tax questions, where the massed
cleverness of the best lawyers and accountants awaits the
tocsin of avoidance, the consonance of purpose and result
requires much understanding and a little bit of luck.
