   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Armed Services Committee, racing
to complete a $289 billion Pentagon spending bill, decided
against providing any money to put nuclear-tipped MX missiles
on specially equipped trains.
   The committee's MX decision, coming as the lawmakers met
behind closed doors, repudiated a major building block of the
Bush administration's nuclear-weapons policies and showed a
widening rift between Democrats and Republicans on the panel.
Details of the bill, which were still being hammered out late
last night, are scheduled to be announced today.

   The White House did receive some good news when the
committee voted to maintain Pentagon spending for the
Strategic Defense Initiative at this year's level of about
$3.5 billion, according to lawmakers and their aides. The
panel also agreed to keep the embattled B-2 Stealth bomber
alive by authorizing the purchase of another pair of the
radar-evading planes in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   All of the important decisions are bound to be debated
again on the Senate floor. The House version of the bill is
expected to reject deployment of the mobile MX missile too,
but it is likely to call for lower levels of spending on SDI
and the B-2.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.), one of the leading GOP
advocates of heftier spending for SDI, mobile missiles and
the B-2, said that the important decisions in the Senate
panel "came on straight party-line votes. It's all being done
by rote."
   The committee was so divided that some GOP lawmakers even
raised last-minute objections to a politically popular
portion of the bill that would require the military to help
civilian agencies collect global pollution data and focus
part of the Pentagon's research on environmental clean-up
projects. The proposal, pushed by the committee's chairman,
Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), is expected to be part of the final
legislation.
   The spending bill, according to lawmakers, puts the MX and
the smaller, single-warhead Midgetman mobile missile on the
back burner by capping 1991 funding at about $700 million for
both weapons. None of the money, however, could be used for
deployment. In addition, aides said the committee was moving
to cut the administration request for building additional
Trident ballistic-missile submarines and Seawolf attack
submarines.
   As expected, the committee voted to cut 100,000 troops in
1991. That figure could climb higher if Pentagon outlays are
capped at a level less than the committee anticipated. Over
the next five years, Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) said the
panel envisions slashing some 500,000 troops from the 2.1
million people currently on active duty.
   Sen. Nunn had advocated the $289 billion
spending-authority limit, which would be $18 billion less
than President Bush's January budget request. The committee
sketched out at least another $4 billion in potential cuts
that could take effect if a bipartisan budget agreement
requires further Pentagon spending reductions.
