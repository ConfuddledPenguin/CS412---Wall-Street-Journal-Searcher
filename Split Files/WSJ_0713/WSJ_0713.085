   International Business Machines Corp. and Diebold Inc.
said they formed a joint venture to develop and market
automated teller machines, the devices that banks use to
dispense cash, take deposits and provide balance information.
   For Diebold, based in Canton, Ohio, the arrangement
provides access to IBM's world-wide marketing network. David
Robertson of the Nilson Report, a newsletter in Santa Monica,
Calif., said the accord should greatly help Diebold. He said
that although Diebold leads in the U.S. market for the
machines, with a 39% share, it has only about 12% of the
world market, which he said would total close to $3 billion
this year.

   The venture could help IBM, Armonk, N.Y., in an area where
the company has struggled. The Nilson Report said IBM has
just 9% of the U.S. market and 5% world-wide. The agreement
is part of IBM's continuing attempts to re-evaluate what
businesses it should be in and to link up with companies with
expertise in certain slices of the computer market.
   Although terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, the
companies did say Diebold will own a majority of the venture.
They said the joint venture will handle U.S. marketing of the
combined product line to the larger banks, while IBM will
market the products overseas. Diebold will provide service
for the products in the U.S. -- and will buy some assets from
IBM's service operation to facilitate this -- while IBM will
handle service overseas. The two companies will continue to
manufacture their existing products.
   Currently, NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, dominates the
automated teller machine market, with what the Nilson Report
says is a 27% share world-wide.
   The joint venture comes at a time when the technology in
automated teller machines is increasingly resembling that of
personal computers, and banks are working very hard to
integrate all their computers, from teller machines up
through their mainframes.
   IBM has set up a series of partnerships of various kinds
over the past year and a half. Most have been with software
companies. In addition, IBM formed a venture with
Chicago-based Baxter Healthcare Corp. to sell software and
services to the medical profession.
   Diebold, for its part, has been saying for some time that
it wanted to expand internationally. Last year, amid talk
that it was a takeover candidate, Diebold also said it was
looking at alternative means of distribution and at ways to
consolidate manufacturing operations to cut costs.
   Although the two companies have nearly 50% of the U.S.
market when combined, they said they didn't anticipate any
antitrust objections from U.S. officials. A Justice
Department spokesman said the agency's antitrust division
isn't currently reviewing the IBM-Diebold joint venture
proposal. He added, though, that the department isn't aware
of the companies' having formally notified antitrust
regulators about their plans.
