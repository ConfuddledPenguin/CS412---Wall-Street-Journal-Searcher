   TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Mining &amp; Cement Co. has reached an
agreement to buy 100% of the shares of Dillingham
Construction Guam Ltd. of the U.S., a Mitsubishi spokesman
said Thursday. The purchase price wasn't disclosed.
   Mitsubishi's unit in the U.S., Mitsubishi Cement
Development Corp., is expected to purchase all the shares of
Dillingham Construction Guam from the parent company,
Dillingham Construction Corp., Pleasanton, Calif., by the end
of this month.

   Mitsubishi expects future demand for construction
materials in Guam and Saipan to grow as the growth of the
tourism industry there boosts construction of resort
facilities.
   Dillingham Construction Guam has construction materials
factories on the islands, including four concrete plants. The
company had sales of $40 million in 1989.
