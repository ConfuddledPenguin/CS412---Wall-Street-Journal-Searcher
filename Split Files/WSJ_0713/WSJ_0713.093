   Esher, England -- Great Britain has more than 60
horse-racing courses, and all are different. On some the
horses run counterclockwise, U.S.-style, but on most they run
the other way. Some have uphill sections, some have
downhills, some have both. Windsor's turf traces a figure
eight. Haydock's backstretch pinches in the center, like a
hairpin.
   Sandown Park, where jockey Steve Cauthen rode for a couple
days last week, is an oval, but wider on one end than
another, which makes it almost a triangle. Coming off the
final (righthand) turn, horses must run slightly uphill three
furlongs to the finish. This makes for good viewing from the
stands, but it's tough going for the animals and requires an
extra bit of calculation from their jockeys.

   "The uphill homestretch means you have to save a bit more
of your horse for the end," notes Cauthen. He smiles and
adds: "That's one of the ways we earn our money here."
   Everyone earns his money one way or another, but Cauthen
and his Brit brethren get more than a bit of their bucks
(pounds, actually) by brainwork rather than by busyness.
Six-race daily cards are standard hereabouts, vs. nine or 10
a day in the U.S., and the racing season lasts only from
March through October, instead of year-round.
   "But with all the variety here, local knowledge is much
more important. It took about three years before I was
confident I knew what I was doing on every track I raced,"
says Cauthen. "Compared with Britain, U.S. jockeys are on a
merry-go-round."
   When Cauthen hopped off the merry-go-round to come to
England in 1979, it was big news. He wasn't called Steve
then, but "Stevie," as in "Stevie Wonder," or, more simply,
"The Kid." The Walton, Ky.-born lad stood U.S. racing on its
ear by capturing the national riding title in 1977 at age 17
with 487 winners and a record for the time of $6,151,750 in
purses. The next year he piloted Affirmed to the Triple Crown
in epic duels with Alydar.
   But then, like Yankee Doodle, he went to London, just to
ride the ponies. The impetus for the move was both positive
-- a $400,000-a-year retainer fee from Robert Sangster, owner
of a large British stable -- and negative -- a bewildering,
110-race losing streak in California.
   At any rate, he liked what he found. So he stayed and
prospered. In 1984, '85 and '87, he was England's leading
rider and in most other years he's been among the top three
(with Pat Eddery and Willie Carson). He has won the Epsom
Derby twice, thus becoming the only man ever to ride winners
of England's and the U.S.'s premier races, and last year,
aboard Old Vic, added their French and Irish equivalents.
   Now 30 years old, he's the contract rider (at a reported
$750,000-per plus race-winnings) for Henry Cecil, England's
leading trainer, and, as such, has first call on some of the
island's best horses.
   British racing's four-month winter break gives him time to
make annual Christmas visits home to Walton, where his family
runs a small breeding farm, and to race in places such as
France, Italy, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Australia, Hong Kong
and, for individual events, the U.S. He was invited to ride
in the Soviet Union a few years ago, but declined, "because I
wasn't sure they'd let me out." He says that, with glasnost,
he'll probably accept the next time he's asked.
   Moreover, in company with Cash Asmussen, an American
expatriate who's among France's leading jockeys, Cauthen
revolutionized the way European jockeys ride. In former days,
they were mostly content to sit companionably in a pack until
a furlong or two from the finish, then dash for home. First
Cauthen, and then Asmussen, showed 'em it was no sin to spur
the pace briskly from the front.
   Cauthen, in turn, admits to being influenced by his
European colleagues. "I ride with my stirrups longer here,
only partly because I'm taller than I was when I came over,"
says the 5-foot-6 jockey. "I also ride a bit straighter to
allow for the changes in ground we have to deal with. I
wouldn't say I've changed styles, but I would say I've
adapted."
   Cauthen's also had to adjust to his fair share of mishaps
over here, including a nasty spill in 1988 that broke a neck
vertebra and sidelined him for two months. In 1985, he
underwent treatment for alcoholism that he said at the time
stemmed from depression over the need to watch his weight
constantly. He won't discuss the episode now other than to
say that he no longer has a drinking problem.
   The weight problem remains, as it does for most mature
jockeys. Cauthen's normal weight is about 130 pounds, but he
tries to keep himself down around 115. That, incidentally,
still puts him on the heavy side for a U.S. jockey. But in
Europe, jockeys tend to weigh a bit more, which is one reason
Cauthen stays here. Still, he has to keep exercising and
"saying `no' a lot more than `yes'" to food. It's no fun, but
he's gotta.
   The British jockey's life grates in other ways, too. Race
meetings here last for only a few days, not months as in the
States, so riders have to cover lots of miles. Cauthen does
it by car from his home in rural Stetchworth, near Newmarket,
but heavy traffic and deteriorating roads may force him to
follow Eddery's example and buy his own airplane.
   Mostly, though, he enjoys life here, and has taken to it
avidly. One widely circulated photo shows him dressed in
tweeds cradling a shotgun -- the proper British gentleman off
for a shoot -- and, yes, that's really him, he says. He calls
soccer "football," like the natives, although his team-sport
favorite remains the Cincinnati Reds. And socially, he
hobnobs with, among others, dukes, duchesses and H.R.H. the
Queen, whose horses he has ridden. He thinks she's "very
nice."
   While he says he remains a Kentucky boy at heart, his
allegiance to the Bluegrass State is no longer unmixed.
"England's part of my life now, and even if I go home when
I'm done riding, I'll always come back," he declares. "My
world's bigger than it used to be, and I wouldn't want that
to change."
