   COCHABAMBA, Bolivia -- Amid thorny Prosopis and cactuses
here in the Andean foothills, the talk of the U.S. unleashing
its might to eradicate coca plantations sends botanist Hardy
Eshbaugh bristling. "It's the ultimate in ugly American," he
says of the U.S. plan to release viruses and microbes to kill
the coca plants or mysteriously take away their ability to
yield any cocaine.
   Mr. Eshbaugh, a botany professor at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio, isn't here to save coca; he is combing the
scorched sierra for wild pepper. Pepper has little in common
with coca, except that both are indigenous to the region. And
the natives have an indispensable affinity for both. But as a
botanist, he sees great folly in America's latest anti-drug
efforts.

   Besides disregarding the South American natives' extensive
cultural and religious use of the coca plants, U.S. policy
recommending crop eradication ignores the potentially
catastrophic effect that such a policy could have on the
ecology of the region. This also could affect the well-being
of millions of people outside this region in ways as yet
unexplored by eradication proponents.
   The targeted area -- here in Bolivia and in neighboring
Peru -- is a cradle of many valuable food crops now common
the world over. Here, the plants' wild ancestors remain as a
repository of valuable genes. These genes can be used to
strengthen existing varieties or create entirely new strains
more resistant to disease. What the U.S. proposes, as Mr.
Eshbaugh and other scientists see it, threatens to create
nothing short of havoc in the region.
   The Bush administration earlier this year proposed a $6.5
million fund to develop biological efforts at the U.S.
Agriculture Department. A deadly herbicide called "Spike,"
made by the pharmaceutical concern Eli Lilly, already has
been tested by the agency. But given the controversy that has
erupted over its indiscriminate destructive power (coca
plantations are interspersed with subsistence crops), an
agency spokesman says a decision about its use will be made
only by the international narcotics office of the State
Department.
   Before proposing the use of such biological and chemical
techniques, the USDA tested swarms of coca-eating
caterpillars on plots in the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru.
The plan was scuttled, says an agency spokesman, "because the
caterpillars can be killed easily."
   But in contemplating biological and chemical attacks, the
U.S. might be endangering a region that, if anything, needs
more protection. Potatoes, pepper, lima beans and tomatoes
are among the betterknown crops that have evolved in the
region. "Dozens more have the potential of becoming major
commercial crops one day," says Noel Vietmeyer, a specialist
on Inca crops at the National Research Council in Washington.
While he doesn't know enough about viruses and microbes to
comment on their potential impact on the region, Mr.
Vietmeyer cites example after example of important genetic
materials that are disappearing in the "cradle regions" due
to human interference.
   The Andean region itself is getting a lot of attention
lately from international botanists and plant breeders.
That's because many of the widely commercialized crops, such
as potatoes and pepper, have lost their natural variability
and are succumbing to viruses and other diseases. The genes
that can improve them reside in their wild ancestors -- here
in the Andes. It's this that brings Mr. Eshbaugh here. He
thinks Bolivia is the region where peppers originated and
hence is likely to have plants with the greatest genetic
diversity. (A 1983 report by the U.N.'s International Board
for Plant Genetic Resources singled out pepper "as a crop
rating high global priority" in collecting and saving
ancestral genes of modern crops.)
   While a potent herbicide like Spike can cause
indiscriminate damage, U.S. officials argue in defense of
biological techniques that a virus or a microbe "tailored" to
attack a specific plant wouldn't spread to any other. But it
doesn't go unnoticed among the botanists in South America
that the U.S. applies different standards within its own
borders.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency keeps a tight lid
on American biotechnology companies' experiments that involve
releasing micro-organisms. In 1983, the California-based
Advanced Genetic Sciences Corp. researchers sprayed a
frost-fighting bacteria on a patch of strawberry plants. The
scientists who did the spraying wore spacesuits. The
experiment itself drew public outcry, and the company had to
shelve the project. Environmental restrictions on tests
involving release of microbes in crops -- justified or not --
have set back quite a few American biotechnology companies.
Although less restrictive today, the EPA still requires
"barrier" crops around genetically altered plants.
   It isn't surprising that Bolivia and Peru, pressured
though they are to cooperate on a program of coca eradication
in return for much-needed economic aid, are reacting strongly
to the U.S.'s latest plans. Alberto Fujimori, the newly
elected president of Peru, has declared that he won't allow
the spraying of herbicides or biological agents detrimental
to the environment. The ambassadors of the two countries
recently said in a letter to the Washington Post that while
their governments pledged cooperation at the drug summit in
Cartagena, Colombia, the U.S.'s latest drug-fighting tactics
"would destroy the working partnership that now exists."
   Both Bolivia and Peru have proposed plans to encourage
farmers to grow substitute crops as a way of slashing coca
production. But in both countries, conventional crops have
lost out to coca, a hardy plant that's easy to grow. A
serious lack of adequate farming machinery and pesticides --
as well as a poor export infrastructure -- hampers
conventional farming. This is precisely where the U.S. could
make a difference in limiting coca production.
   Crop substitution won't be an easy thing to accomplish as
long as North America and Europe keep demanding cocaine, the
agricultural experts here believe. Nevertheless, the price of
coca is on the decline, and this might be a good time for the
U.S. to reallocate its resources from crop destruction to
crop substitution. At least one crop is already economically
more attractive than coca.
   In a vast field of "locoto" peppers nestled in a mountain
range, not too far from the coca-growing Chapare region, a
farmer says of his lush waist-high crop: "This is the most
profitable of all crops, more than tomatoes and beans."
   "Even coca?" he is asked.
   The coca-chewing farmer, who's constantly reaching into a
small plastic bag of dried leaves he's carrying, nods in
agreement: "For 50 kilograms {of locoto peppers} I can make
between $20 and $80, depending upon the season." This is far
more than what he could get for a comparative amount of coca.
Later, Mr. Eshbaugh says of the farmer and his family: "They
were unusually educated. Growing locoto requires a very
specialized knowledge of pesticides and growing conditions."
This is the kind of technical assistance coca-growing
peasants need.
