   NEW YORK -- There were plenty of grand pronouncements 10
years ago when the New York Stock Exchange held a gala
opening for its financial-futures market, the New York
Futures Exchange.
   "Whatever Chicago can do, we can do better," boasted
then-Mayor Ed Koch as the new market burst upon the scene.

   Today, however, Mr. Koch isn't in office, the Chicago
financial-futures pits remain teeming, and the New York
Futures Exchange has become nearly invisible.
   Traders at the NYFE (pronounced "knife") are so upset
these days with the faltering trading volume that they're
nearly rebelling against the futures exchange's owner, the
Big Board. Traders have even bantered about a "dues" strike,
although longtime trader Clay Tompkins, a vice chairman of
the exchange's floor committee, says there aren't any real
plans for such a strike.
   Traders and futures-industry executives wonder how long
the Big Board will support an exchange where seat prices have
fallen to $100 apiece from as much as $35,000 a few years
ago. Volume accounts for less than 1% of the U.S. futures
industry's total.
   "The reason the New York Stock Exchange maintains NYFE is
because it gives them a private lookout into the futures
industry," says a former member of the NYFE board, which once
boasted 31 members but now is down to six. The once-grand
aspirations of the market have long evaporated.
   Trouble erupted most recently on June 26 at a members'
meeting here. Only about 60 traders showed up, and most of
them seemed to have complaints. Lewis Horowitz, a Big Board
executive vice president and NYFE chairman, tried to assure
the traders that the exchange continues to have the backing
of Richard Grasso, the Big Board's president. Mr. Horowitz
said, "There is not now, and never has been, any talk of
closing the exchange down."
   Still, members' dissatisfaction with NYFE continues to
grow. Complaints have been aired about Mr. Horowitz's salary
and bonus, believed to total more than $550,000 for 1989. One
former board member notes that Leo Melamed, president of the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange where 60 times as many contracts
are traded as at NYFE, gets a salary of $500,000. (A Big
Board spokesman says Mr. Horowitz's salary also reflects his
other duties as Big Board executive vice president for equity
sales.)
   Members' complaints cover nearly every aspect of the
exchange -- from the contracts it trades to the way the
exchange is managed. High on the dissatisfaction list is the
lack of support for NYFE contracts, especially the futures
contract on the Big Board's composite index of stock prices.
(NYFE also trades futures on the Commodity Research Bureau,
or CRB, index of commodities prices.)
   Mr. Grasso, the Big Board president, declined to be
interviewed for this article.
   Unlike other futures exchanges, NYFE isn't owned by its
members, but by the Big Board. NYFE seats don't confer
equity, or ownership -- only the right to trade.
   Warren Seeley, the largest trader in the CRB futures
contract on NYFE, says the result is unresponsive
administration. "The current management of the exchange has
to answer only to the officers of the Big Board and not to
the members {of the NYFE}," he says. The stock exchange
appoints members to NYFE's board.
   Many exchange members believe that the only way NYFE can
be saved is by structural changes that make it more like
other exchanges with the members' being the owners. Mr.
Tompkins, the floor vice chairman, met this past week with
Mr. Grasso for a "philosophical discussion" of the NYFE's
future. According to Mr. Tompkins, Mr. Grasso told him the
stock exchange wasn't willing to sell NYFE at any price the
members could afford to pay. The Big Board in any case wants
NYFE to keep its presence in the futures industry, Mr.
Tompkins says he was told.
   Mr. Tompkins says NYFE is doomed unless a way is found to
lower margins, or good-faith deposits needed to trade, on the
Big Board composite contract to around $3,500 from a current
level of $9,000. Mr. Horowitz, the NYFE chairman, doesn't
agree. "Reductions in margins don't increase business," he
says.
