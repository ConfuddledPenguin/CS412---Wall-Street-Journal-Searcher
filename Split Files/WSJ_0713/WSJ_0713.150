   NEW YORK -- A New York state appeals court upheld an
agreement between the state and Long Island Lighting Co.
under which Lilco is to sell its Shoreham nuclear power plant
to the state for $1.
   The 5-0 decision, which had been expected, upheld two
lower court rulings that found that state officials, led by
Gov. Mario Cuomo, were duly authorized by the state
legislature to enter into the agreement.

   "This is great news for Lilco," said Daniel Scotto,
utility-bond analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp.
   Lilco continues to own Shoreham, pending federal
regulatory approval of the transfer of the license to a state
agency. Nevertheless, the Hicksville, N.Y., utility already
is getting the first of the sizable rate increases that also
are part of its agreement with the state-rate increases that
have brought Lilco back to financial health after years of
being bled by the completed but never operational Shoreham.
   While the state originally said it planned to dismantle
Shoreham, more recently it has had discussions about possibly
converting the plant into a natural gas-fired plant.
   The ruling by the appellate division of State Supreme
Court follows a recent federal appeals court ruling that
effectively eliminated Lilco's financial liability under a
racketeering judgment against the company. Suffolk County,
N.Y., officials have said they may bring another similar
claim against the utility.
   Lilco shares closed at $21.125, up 12.5 cents, in moderate
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
