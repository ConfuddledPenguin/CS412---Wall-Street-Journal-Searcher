   In regard to Martin Morse Wooster's May 25 editorial-page
article "Chairs of Entrepreneurship Are Bad Business": As
president of the Association of Private Enterprise Education,
I feel some responsibility to respond to his conclusion that
the chairs collectively deserve such a label.
   First, each chair of private enterprise and
entrepreneurship is a unique entity, established by an
educational institution with funding from one or more donors.
Each has its own objectives, and its character generally is
derived from the individual who holds the chair. Since I
personally know a number of the chairholders, I can say that
among this group are individuals dedicated to research and
scholarship, to generating programs for student audiences as
well as public forums, to teaching in the classrooms on their
campuses, and some who may do all of the above.

   These chairs are part of a much broader effort to educate
Americans about how the private-enterprise system works and
how it might be improved to benefit each citizen. Perhaps a
role that differentiates chairs of private enterprise or
entrepreneurship from the think tanks Mr. Wooster has
described is that chairholders frequently assume
responsibility for taking economic research, wherever
generated, and translating it for presentation to the public
and, particularly, to our young people. It is all too
frequent that individuals cloistered in research environments
focus on very narrow topics, the findings of which have
little or no application to the real world. Chairholders need
not apologize for believing it is important to work with
elementary and secondary schoolteachers to better prepare
them to teach our children about our institutions and the
tools of analysis and critical thinking.
   I find it a rare case in which a chair's only purpose is
to expound a particular ideology. Indeed, I am sure Mr.
Wooster is well aware that many of the first-rate research
organizations to which he referred, including his own Reason
Foundation, are not immune from being described in the press
as "right wing" or "conservative" think tanks, a label with
which they may or may not agree. Labels are one means of
attempting to discredit individuals, groups or products. I
draw a very simple conclusion. There is so much to be done
with respect to improving our private-enterprise system that
no single group can accomplish this objective. It is
unfortunate Mr. Wooster has taken the tack of negative
campaigning: trying to get ahead by distorting the goals,
activities and achievements of others. I believe that
research organizations, university chairs and public and
private schoolteachers all have distinct and important roles
to fill in improving our economic well-being.

   Research shows that activities of "entrepreneurship"
centers are oriented toward research, not away, as with
private-enterprise centers as Mr. Wooster mentions. Herbert
Kierulff (1985) found 11 chairs specifically mentioning
"entrepreneurship" in the title. Of the 11, the majority
mentioned research in their mission.
   Mr. Wooster's statement that "no one offers doctorates in
free enterprise or entrepreneurship" is incorrect. I am a
Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh Joseph M.
Katz Graduate School of Business, and my area of
concentration is Entrepreneurship and Marketing. I know of
several others across the country who have also combined a
study of entrepreneurship with one of the more traditional
areas of study. Interest in the advanced study on this topic
is growing and students of today will be conducting research
on the topic of entrepreneurship in the future.

   By describing chairs in "free enterprise" and
"entrepreneurship" as if they were the same thing, Mr.
Wooster failed to recognize the clear differences between
them and erroneously attributed the alleged flaws of the
former to both.
   As he correctly indicated, chairs carrying the
free-enterprise title are funded principally to foster
pro-market, pro-capitalist positions. Chairs in
entrepreneurship, in contrast, are funded primarily to foster
concerns for risk-taking, whether in the formation of new
enterprises or in the renewal and revitalization of existing
ones.
   While it is certainly arguable that free-enterprise
economies tend to stimulate more entrepreneurial activity,
the fact remains that the study of entrepreneurship is not
synonymous with espousing pro-capitalist positions. As Mr.
Wooster noted, Beloit College's Prof. Jerry Gustafson, who
holds a chair in entrepreneurship, stated that the foundation
funding him "isn't interested in being ideological at all."
   Given Mr. Wooster's final paragraph, it is clear that his
real message is that those who want to espouse
free-enterprise positions would be better off funding
organizations such as the Cato Institute rather than
supporting chairs at universities. Perhaps he is right.
However, making the same case for not supporting chairs in
entrepreneurship is an altogether different story.
