   "Bush's efforts at balance, compromise and

   Those words belong to Jay Hair, the president of one of
the U.S.'s most prominent environmental groups, the National
Wildlife Federation, which with 150 groups from the seven
summit nations was in Houston to "monitor" the proceedings.
We're now to believe that George Bush is "killing the world"
because his political values include balance, compromise and
consensus-building. We may well be arriving at a moment of
reckoning in this country's attitudes toward the
environmentalists. The leading evidence for this is the
attitude of the U.S. President.
   At his press conference after the summit ended Wednesday,
the last question Mr. Bush got was, "Mr. President, the
environmental groups that were very much in evidence here
don't seem too happy with the results of the summit." Mr.
Bush replied: "Hey, they haven't seemed happy with me for a
long time. And I'm not too happy with them. But what's the
question?"
   "Well, sir, the question is, they're calling your
forestation initiative a fig leaf to cover up your inaction
on the environment."
   President Bush: "Oh, I can't -- look, come on, I'm not
going to respond to those groups that have been attacking us
every time we turn around. I have to be careful because there
were some reasonable people involved. But on the
environmental extreme, they don't want this country to grow.
They don't want to look down the road at the human
consequence of men and women thrown out of work and families
put into a whole new state of anxiety. And I as President
have to be concerned about that, as well as being a good
custodian, a good steward for the environment. We cannot
govern by listening to the loudest voice on the extreme of an
environmental movement. I did not rely heavily on them for
support in getting elected President of the United States,
and I'm not going to be persuaded that I can get some brownie
point by appealing to one of these groups.
   "And the attacks that they made on some of my summit
partners, I resent too. . . . But I had a little cloakroom
conversation with some of the participants and I think most
of them are disinclined to change policies in their countries
that they think are sound because of some of the statements
that I saw and perhaps some that you were referring to here.
   "We'll listen and keep trying to do better, but I am
determined that we can find a sound environmental path and
still have some concern for the working man and the working
woman in this country. And that really is what it boils down
to when you talk about no growth. I'm not going to talk about
no growth for the United States because I feel a deep concern
about the human equation as well as the environment."
   We suspect that Mr. Bush is not the only person who is
beginning to feel that his good-faith efforts on
environmental matters will never satisfy movement activists
whose agenda is increasingly taking on the trappings of
religious fanaticism. Indeed, a Journal story this week noted
that charitable giving to environmental groups remains low.
One reason, an environmentalist suggested, is the belief
"that if you donate to environmental groups, they will help
the spotted owl and hurt people." Which of course they will,
as is now evident to the University of Arizona, the Max
Planck Institute and the Vatican Observatory.
   This consortium is attempting to erect a set of telescopes
on a mountain outside Tucson but the project is bogged down
in a lawsuit over the "endangered" red squirrel. Among the
plaintiffs: the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, the National
Audubon Society and the National Wildlife Federation.
Scientists from Max Planck and the Vatican are now saying
they may abandon the project. American science must recede
and withdraw before this movement.
   The biggest environmental project of our time remains the
Clean Air Bill. We've long felt that the groups may have
overplayed their hand on this legislation. Now, in a
soon-to-be-published economic analysis of the bill in the
Journal of Economic Perspectives, a leading environmentalist
expresses serious concerns about the bill's effects.
   "If these estimates are even close to correct," writes
Paul R. Portney, the vice president of Resources for the
Future, "Congress and the President are about to shake hands
on a landmark piece of environmental law for which costs may
exceed benefits by a considerable margin. To repeat, the
costs of the proposed new air quality controls have been
little analyzed and even the preliminary results have not
been accessible to the public. If it were more widely
appreciated that, when fully implemented, the Clean Air
amendments may cost each U.S. household $300-$400 per year,
perhaps opposition would be sharper."
   As with taxes, Americans have always been willing to pay
for programs that they could identify as producing tangible
benefits. The effort to protect nature from unnecessary
degradation has been such a commitment. It appears to us,
however, that in recent years the environmental movement has
begun to feel it is not bound by the normal constraints of
political life, such as those mentioned by President Bush in
the remarks above. A voice that says the President is
"killing the world" is the familiar voice of political
extremism.
