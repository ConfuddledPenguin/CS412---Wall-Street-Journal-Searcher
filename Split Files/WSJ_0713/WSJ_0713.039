   "Coyote Waits" (Harper &amp; Row, 292 pages, $19.95) is the
10th of Tony Hillerman's police-procedural novels set
primarily among the Native American peoples of New Mexico. It
proves to be as smoothly written and satisfying as any of its
predecessors in this interesting and well done series.
   Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee are the Navajo
tribal policemen assigned to solve Mr. Hillerman's puzzles,
cases made more baffling and exotic by the Indian beliefs and
traditions woven through the narratives. The veteran Leaphorn
and the somewhat impulsive Chee alternated as detectives in
Mr. Hillerman's earlier books. For the past three titles the
two characters have been loosely paired, working along
parallel lines toward the same conclusions.

   Chee and Leaphorn eventually are partnered in this new
book as well. Each is thinking of leaving police work near
the beginning of "Coyote Waits." Leaphorn, a recent widower,
is contemplating retirement. Chee, guilty over his
inadvertent failure to prevent the death of a fellow officer,
is considering turning in his badge.
   At first, it seems, there's no mystery at all. Chee's
fellow officer has been killed, but a suspect -- drunk, and
in possession of the murder weapon -- has been immediately
arrested, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (in charge
of felonies committed on the reservation) is convinced of his
guilt. The suspect's lawyer, though, is a friend of Chee's,
and she prompts the policeman into seeing if there might be
more to this matter than meets the FBI. Leaphorn, unbeknownst
to Chee, begins his own investigation into the same events as
a favor to the suspect's niece, a member of his late wife's
family clan.
   What's gradually uncovered is a skein of connections
between the suspect (a part-time shaman), rival academics who
used him as a source for native lore, a possibly crazed
painter who's furtively defacing desert rock formations, a
Vietnamese family receiving CIA protection, and some
historically interesting corpses that may have been preserved
for decades up a remote canyon pass.
   Here, as in all of Mr. Hillerman's tales, the ways things
are revealed are as interesting as the things themselves.
Navajo conversational etiquette requires patience and tact
from the listener and affords the speaker a good deal of
discretionary space. This leads to interrogation sessions
rather different from those on "Miami Vice." In charting the
nuances of such interchanges, Mr. Hillerman conveys more
genuine tension and suspense than are contained in any number
of ammo-laden thrillers. When a vital fact is at last
discovered or a crucial event occurs, it comes with the
sudden force of a thunderclap above a quiet mesa.
   As usual, Mr. Hillerman conveys wonderfully the weather
and geography of his Southwestern setting. His very prose --
lean sentences without an apparent ounce of fat -- seems to
mirror the stark New Mexico terrain.
   Less compelling is the latest entry in another popular
series, the Spenser private-eye novels of Robert B. Parker.
"Stardust" (Putnam, 256 pages, $18.95) has the sardonic
Spenser trying to protect a foul-mouthed alcoholic TV actress
from an unknown someone who may or may not be harrassing her.
The actress is Jill Joyce, "America's honeybun," a
small-screen star for 20 years and possessor of "the highest
TVQ of anyone now on television."
   Surly, sluttish and often soused before noon, Joyce is
playing "a woman shrink" in a show being filmed on location
in Spenser's Boston. It's hard to believe such an indiscreet
and unpleasant character could hide her checkered past and
preserve her wholesome image in an era of tell-all tabloids
and gossip snoops. It's also tough to imagine even a nasty
star surviving for two decades without acquiring some sort of
support entourage.
   Be that as it may, Spenser hires on to look into the
threats Joyce supposedly has been receiving. Things get more
serious when the star's stunt double is found murdered on the
set. Spenser's cohort, Hawk, is deputized to keep an eye on
the client, while the PI hunts up suspects on both coasts.
When the murder finally is solved, its resolution hinges on
the killer's having read news accounts that are news to the
reader, too.
   The hero's better one-liners meanwhile prompt a few
chuckles. (On a postmodern house in the country, all slabs
and angles and slants: "The place looked like it had been
designed by Georges Braque while drunk." On his own clipped
speech: "I felt like I was trapped in a Hemingway short
story. If I got any more cryptic I wouldn't be able to talk
at all.") A poignant ending somewhat redeems a rather
listless story.
   For the most part, though, the obligatory wisecracks --
the put-downs, the put-ons, the snappy comebacks -- and the
sexy banter between Spenser and his girlfriend, Dr. Susan
Silverman, all seem familiar and forced. The hero comes off
less as a believable private investigator than a parody of a
fictional gumshoe. This tough guy's charm is wearing thin.
