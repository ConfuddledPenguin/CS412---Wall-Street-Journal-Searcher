   PARIS -- France officially has 2.3 million people, equal
to 9.3% of the work force, seeking jobs. French employers,
meanwhile, say they're having more trouble finding enough
people to hire than at any time since 1979. West German
employers, despite an unemployment rate of about 6%, higher
than that in the U.S., have absorbed hundreds of thousands of
East German refugees this year, and still say they're short
of skilled help.
   After nearly a decade of steady economic growth,
unemployment continues to fall throughout the industrialized
world, but still remains historically high in spots. Even
massive programs aimed at removing barriers to job creation,
such as the European Community's 1992 program, either haven't
worked yet or haven't worked well enough.

   Nonetheless, with some economies, such as those of Germany
and France, now working at or near their total production
capacity, worries have developed that job shortages may soon
lead to higher wage settlements. Those wages could in turn
fuel higher inflation that could eventually choke off the
economic recovery.
   Paradoxes like these have led the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development to shift the emphasis of
its advice to its 24 industrialized members on how to cut
unemployment. The OECD for the past decade has urged policies
that stimulated macro-economic growth, coupled with the
removal of regulations or other internal impediments to
creating jobs, all softened by generous unemployment benefits
to tide people over until the jobs were created.
   Now, though, after six years in a row in which higher
economic growth has cut unemployment rates nearly everywhere
in the OECD, the government-sponsored research body is
suggesting that governments worry more about ensuring a
continuing supply of future workers.
   Governments currently spend about 2% of their gross
national products on job programs, the OECD says, with
two-thirds of the money going to benefit payments, and
one-third to training. The OECD's annual Employment Outlook
suggests that governments would do better shifting direct
payments to programs to train workers or expand the work
force. More women should be tempted back into the workplace
by offering better child care. Unemployment payments should
be increasingly tied to training programs. The efficiency of
public and private job-search and job-matching agencies
should be increased.
   "The demographic trends show clearly that there will be
fewer young people coming along at the same time that
technological advances are demanding different kinds of
skills and different kinds of work arrangements," says Tom
Alexander, head of the OECD's Directorate for Social Affairs,
Manpower and Education. Meanwhile, the economic boom is
drawing more and more migrants, from North Africa, Eastern
Europe and Latin America, into the OECD. These migrants often
take low-skilled, low-paid jobs that have previously gone
begging, even in European countries with high unemployment
rates.
   Both anecdotal and statistical evidence suggests that,
particularly in Europe, the people who've been out of work
the longest either don't have the skills employers are
looking for; or won't trade unemployment benefits for
low-paying manual jobs; or won't move to where the jobs are,
even within their own countries. This lack of labor mobility
-- mobility that is one of the great strengths of the U.S. --
isn't expected to improve much in Europe even after the 1992
program removes most barriers to the movement of people
across European borders.
   Meanwhile, necessary jobs are being filled from outside,
even as national unemployment rolls remain long. Paris's
street cleaners are nearly all immigrants. West Germany's
vast, usually family-owned machine tool industry desperately
seeks tool-and-die makers, thin on the ground in Duesseldorf,
but plentiful in Dresden and elsewhere in East Germany. The
long-term unemployed in Europe don't all have to become
street sweepers, but thousands could be retrained as
technical workers. Unemployed Germans can't all set dies, but
they could be drawn back into the work force through
subsidized on-the-job training programs, the OECD says.
   The trend toward some sort of "workfare" is increasingly
well-established in Europe. Sweden has long tied unemployment
benefits to training programs, France last year introduced a
sort of minimum wage for the down and out, requiring
recipients to participate in counseling or training to
reabsorb them into the work force. The Dutch have transferred
much of their benefits program from a government agency to a
tripartite body involving employers and unions as well.
   The OECD's report projects a virtually stable unemployment
picture for this year and next, after a sizable fall in 1989.
U.S. unemployment is expected to rise to 5.4% in 1991, from
5.3% this year. West German unemployment is projected to rise
to 6.1% this year from 5.5% last year, reflecting the
absorption of East Germany, but then to begin falling in
1991.
   However, OECD officials added that their official
projections on German unemployment may be overly pessimistic.
"There's really no sign yet of increasing unemployment in
West Germany," says Mr. Alexander. As for fears in many
Western European countries that jobs will flee to the East in
search of lower-paid workers and lower government social
charges, so far there isn't any evidence of that, either.
   Western European labor leaders want to make sure it never
happens. "Some employers look on Eastern Europe as an
inviting pool of cheap labor," says Gavin Laird, general
secretary of Britain's Amalgamated Engineering Union. "But
the people of Eastern Europe haven't thrown off their
Communist oppressors simply to be conned by some Western
industrialist offering Third World wages. They've had 45
years of watching a privileged Communist elite skim off the
cream. Now they want to be the new Japan, with economic
prosperity for all, not just the few."
