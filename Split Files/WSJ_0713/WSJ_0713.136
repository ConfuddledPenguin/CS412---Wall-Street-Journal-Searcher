   Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles, confirmed reports
that it has "had an interest" in acquiring European Vinyls
Corp., a jointly owned plastics business of Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC of Britain and Enimont S.p.A. of Italy.
   Occidental Petroleum said that its Occidental Chemical
Corp. unit has held discussions on the subject but that these
talks haven't reached the level of negotiations. The company
also said the values of any proposed transactions haven't
been discussed. Enimont and Imperial Chemical denied a report
in the Financial Times that they are discussing the sale of
their jointly owned plastics business, one of the world's
largest, for as much as $1.8 billion.

   Enimont said it "denies having any discussion or
negotiation to cede its interests in {European Vinyls}.
Therefore, the reports of a possible cessation to Occidental
Petroleum are without foundation." Separately, Imperial
Chemical said it "is not involved in any discussions over a
possible sale of its . . . interest in European Vinyls Corp."
