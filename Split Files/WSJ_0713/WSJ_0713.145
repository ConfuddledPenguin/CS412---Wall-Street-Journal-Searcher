   DALLAS -- The former chief executive officer of
Diversified Human Resources Group Inc. was indicted on
charges of bank fraud and money laundering in connection with
a loan from a now-defunct Texas bank.
   William M. Brothers, who also served as president of the
employment-services concern until he resigned March 31, is
accused of submitting fraudulent corporate resolutions to the
First State Bank of Rockwall, Texas, in order to obtain a
personal loan of $385,000 in 1987.

   The allegedly fraudulent resolutions purportedly stated
that Diversified Human Resources would guarantee as much as
$210,000 of the loan to Mr. Brothers. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which took over the Rockwall bank, sued the
company to collect on the guarantee but the suit was later
dismissed, according to the company's 1989 annual report.
   The seven-count indictment, returned by a federal grand
jury in Dallas, specifically charges Mr. Brothers with
conspiracy, two counts of laundering the borrowed funds and
bank robbery. If convicted of all counts, Mr. Brothers would
face a maximum possible sentence of 60 years in federal
prison and a fine of $1.75 million.
   Mr. Brothers couldn't be reached for comment. Gary Steeds,
president and chief executive officer of Diversified Human
Resources, said the company wouldn't have any comment on the
indictment. "That's really a personal matter between him and
the government, and it doesn't affect the company," Mr.
Steeds said.
