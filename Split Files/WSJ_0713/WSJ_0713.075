   MNC Financial Inc., a Baltimore-based financial services
company, said it expects to post a second-quarter loss of
about $75 million, or 90 cents a fully diluted share,
primarily because of a 71% increase in loan-loss reserves,
and a write-off.
   In the year-earlier quarter, MNC earned $66.6 million, or
78 cents a fully diluted share.
