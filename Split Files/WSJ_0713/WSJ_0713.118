   ABORTION IN THE GERMANYS

   East Germany's major political factions said they would
fight to retain a liberal abortion law when the nation unites
with West Germany.
   The archconservative German Social Union was the only
party of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's governing
coalition that objected to retaining the law. "An abortion is
always murder," said one German Social Union lawmaker.
   East Germany allows a female over age 14 to receive an
abortion on demand during the first three months of
pregnancy. West Germany allows abortions in the first three
months only in cases of rape or incest, if the mother's life
is in danger, if the fetus is expected to be severely
handicapped, or if the woman's financial situation would make
it impossible for her to raise a child.
   In West Germany, a nation of 60 million, there were 75,297
abortions performed last year; East Germany, with 16 million
people, had 73,000 abortions.
                                                                                                       

   JORDANIAN ART UPROAR
                                                                                                       

   Jordan's Moslem Brotherhood and other Islamic
fundamentalist legislators have condemned the government for
staging a Western-style arts festival championed by U.S.-born
Queen Noor. Branding the government as careless and
irresponsible, the festival's critics said it should have
been canceled because Jordan is facing grave economic
problems and should be preparing for a holy war to liberate
Palestine. The queen opened the festival Wednesday evening in
Jerash, 25 miles north of Amman.
                                                                                                       

   SPANISH NUCLEAR INCIDENT
                                                                                                       

   Spain's Vandellos II nuclear plant went back on line
yesterday, four days after it was ordered closed due to a
valve leak that filled the containment building with
radioactive steam. The start-up of Vandellos II, one of the
newest of Spain's nine operating nuclear plants, was
authorized by the Nuclear Security Commission after it
investigated the incident, which didn't leak any radiation
into the air. A commission spokeswoman said preliminary
investigative data indicated the plant's owner, the
Asociacion Nuclear Vandellos, delayed reporting the incident.
                                                                                                       

   INDIA'S AIRBUSES TO FLY AGAIN
                                                                                                       

   The Indian Airlines Airbus-320 jetliners grounded after a
fatal crash last February will return to the skies next week,
the Civil Aviation Ministry said. Soon after the accident at
the Bangalore airport in southern India, the government
grounded the airline's remaining 14 Airbus-320s pending an
investigation. Civil Aviation Minister Arif Mohammad Khan
said the planes would be reintroduced in phases.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIAN SHEEP
                                                                                                       

   Australia imposed tighter regulations on live-sheep
exports in an effort to reverse the sheep's poor image in the
Mideast. A shipload of 20,000 sheep was rejected by Bahrain
this week because the incidence of scabby-mouth disease was
greater than the accepted level of 5%. Other shipments to the
Mideast were turned away in April and May. An official of the
Australian Meat &amp; Livestock Corp. said the new guidelines
include having a veterinarian travel on each ship.
                                                                                                       

   KLM HIRES MCKINSEY
                                                                                                       

   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has hired the
management-consultant group McKinsey &amp; Co. to advise it on
how to cut costs. The airline said it would form an
employees' committee that would be advised by McKinsey on how
to maintain service while cutting costs. The committee and
McKinsey "have to come up with advice about how to do things
efficiently. In the competitive world of civil aviation, you
can't cut costs that reduce quality because that is what the
customer wants," a KLM spokesman said.
                                                                                                       

   DISAPPEARANCE IN POLAND
                                                                                                       

   Lech Grobelny, the founder of the BKO savings bank in
Warsaw and owner of a chain of currency exchanges, hasn't
returned from a holiday abroad, the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza
reported.
   According to the report, Mr. Grobelny left Poland on June
6 for a two-week holiday in an undisclosed location.
Employees told the newspaper they last heard from him in late
June when he informed them he would return home July 6. On
Monday, employees informed the prosecutor's office about Mr.
Grobelny's continuing absence.
   About 10,000 customers have accounts with BKO with
deposits of some 32 billion zlotys, or $3.3 million dollars,
according to the daily. But rumors of the BKO owner's
disappearance have been circulating for some time in Warsaw
and the bank's cash reserves have shrunk due to increased
withdrawals.
   BKO was closed yesterday, and customers found a note on
the door telling them to "vindicate their claims at a
district court," the news agency PAP said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering will no longer be
honorary citizens of Potsdam, East Germany, if a City Hall
proposal is approved next month, the East German news agency
ADN reported. The two were awarded the honor in 1933, but it
was never revoked, partly because of the ousted Communist
leadership's fear of causing a public scandal, ADN said. . .
. A Pakistani has been sentenced to death in Bahrain for drug
trafficking, the Akhbar al-Khaleej newspaper reported. It was
the first time the death penalty for drug smuggling was
imposed in Bahrain since it was introduced in 1984.
