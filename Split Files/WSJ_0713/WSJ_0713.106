   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Jean R. Canon, one of the first
protesters to be accused of trying to disrupt the tax system
and harass public officials and others by filing false Form
1099 reports, was convicted of all charges against him.
   After a half-day, non-jury trial, federal Judge Juan G.
Burciaga found Mr. Canon guilty of 17 counts of filing false
statements and making a false claim against the federal
government. The 47-year-old defendant represented himself at
the trial, but didn't testify. He is to be sentenced on Sept.
28, according to federal prosecutor David Farnham.

   Form 1099s are used to tell the Internal Revenue Service
about non-wage payments to others. Undetected false reports
may cause needless and costly IRS audits of the protesters'
targets. The use of phony 1099s in New Mexico and elsewhere,
which has led to 65 IRS criminal investigations, was the
subject of a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal in
April.
