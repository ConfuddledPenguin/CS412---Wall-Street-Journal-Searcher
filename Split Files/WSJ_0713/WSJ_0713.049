   Federal Express Corp. said it had a slight increase in net
income in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended May 31, but it
reported a drop in operating profit, reflecting continued
losses overseas.
   The Memphis, Tenn.-based air-express concern reported net
income of $43.1 million, or 81 cents a share, up 5% from $41
million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed
15% to $1.91 billion from $1.67 billion.

   But the earnings gain, Federal's first year-to-year profit
growth since November 1988, masks some underlying problems.
Federal's operating profit declined 7% in the period. It is
still being hurt by its attempts to expand abroad, and a
sudden downturn in its domestic business in recent months is
compounding its problems.
   "The sluggishness in the domestic economy is showing up
and they don't see any pickup," said Kevin Murphy, a
transportation analyst with Morgan Stanley. "This is a
company in the throes of a transition to a new type of
business. It's still a good game plan, but I don't see any
reasonable signs that it's bearing fruit right now."
   Federal was able to report a profit boost in the quarter,
despite the drop in operating profit, by reducing interest
expenses and adjusting some liabilities from its acquisition
last year of Tiger International Inc. In all, it reported
$14.4 million less of what it calls "other expenses" in the
period, compared with a year ago.
   For the year, Federal had net income of $115.8 million, or
$2.18 a share, down 31% from $184.6 million, or $3.53 a
share, in fiscal 1989. Revenue rose 36% to $7.02 billion from
$5.17 billion.
   Mr. Murphy estimated that Federal had losses of $150
million in its most recent fiscal year from overseas
expansion. Much of those losses came in Europe, where freight
forwarders -- the middlemen that book freight transportation
for clients -- have been reluctant to use the heavy-cargo
operation that Federal acquired with Tiger, because they view
Federal as a potential competitor in door-to-door service.
   "Forwarders are watching the situation very, very
closely," said Manfred Engst, executive vice president of
Schenkers International Forwarders Inc., Frankfurt, West
Germany, a freight broker and a large Federal customer.
   On Federal's trans-Pacific routes, cargo shipments have
fallen nearly 20% since February, analysts say, because of
sluggish import demand in the U.S. that's affecting all
carriers.
   Thomas Oliver, Federal's senior vice president,
international, said the company has found that for every 1%
that the U.S. economy slows down, imports drop 10%. He said
Federal's business is slowly improving in Europe, but still
has a long way to go.
   Mr. Oliver refused to predict when Federal's struggling
international operations would become profitable, saying
only, "I'm quite positive about what we can accomplish in the
next few years."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Federal closed at $45.50, up 87.5 cents.
