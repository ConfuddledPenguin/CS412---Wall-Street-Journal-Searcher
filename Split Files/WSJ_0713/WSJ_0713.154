   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. filed a $500
million cross-complaint against Time Warner Inc. and its
units charging that Time Warner breached its agreement to
bankroll half of Pathe's proposed $1.3 billion merger with
MGM/UA Communications Co.
   Last month, Time Warner filed a $100 million lawsuit
against Pathe charging "willful, wanton and malicious" breach
of contract in the collapse of that pact.

   In a statement, Time Warner said, "Pathe's cross complaint
is just its latest attempt to divert attention from the
facts, which are that Pathe breached its April 1990 agreement
with Time Warner, its theatrical distribution agreement with
Warner Brothers and a video rights distribution agreement
with Warner Home Video."
   Time Warner also said it intends to schedule the
depositions of Giancarlo Parretti, the head of Pathe, and one
of his partners immediately.
   The Pathe suit, filed in state superior court here,
charges, among other things, that Time Warner failed to honor
an agreement to guarantee a $650 million bank loan or to loan
Pathe that amount itself. As part of that transaction, Time
Warner was going to obtain certain rights to the film
libraries of United Artists, Pathe and its Cannon unit.
   Time Warner has said the agreement collapsed after Pathe
failed to come up with sufficient equity, taking on
additional debt instead. However, the latest suit contends
that Pathe did meet its obligations to obtain $600 million in
non-debt financing. The suit says Pathe met all other
conditions except those "excused by the acts or conduct of
Time Warner." The suit alleges that Time Warner failed to
provide the $650 million loan to Pathe "without any
reasonable explanation."
   The Pathe suit says Time Warner was unable to find an
outside bank willing to lend Pathe $650 million, and it notes
that Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed Time Warner's debt on a
CreditWatch list soon after the agreement. The suit says that
although it was unable to obtain the loan, Time Warner was
still "highly desirous" of obtaining the rights to the film
libraries, and it pressured Pathe to make a deal more
advantageous to Time Warner.
   The suit alleges that Time Warner "knowingly put Pathe at
risk of losing the $200 million non-refundable deposit made
to MGM/UA" and a $75 million security interest granted to
MGM/UA. Pathe also contends that Time Warner's actions forced
Pathe to renegotiate its agreement with MGM/UA, increasing
the cost of the acquisition by more than $200 million.
