   NEW YORK -- Once-revered stock market strategists are
finding that they're falling out of favor.
   In the bull market years of the 1980s, the strategists
were heroes. They scoped out ranges for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, forecast Federal Reserve policy, flagged
hot industry groups and turned the caution lights on when
stocks got too steamy. The words of strategists such as
Steven Einhorn at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Charles Clough at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., and Elaine Garzarelli at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. were treasured by portfolio managers.

   But 1990 is shaping up to be the year of the stock picker.
Indeed, Mr. Einhorn titled one of his first reports of 1990,
"The Year of the Securities Analyst," which highlighted the
trend toward the selection of individual stocks as the key to
beating the market averages this year. He almost called the
report "The Decade of the Securities Analyst." Mr. Einhorn
says, "I am spending much more time talking to my clients
about stocks" than market timing.
   General calls on interest rates, stock market moves and
industry groups are less important now to money managers than
a good stock such as Claire's Stores, up 61.5% this year.
   And as a result, money managers' opinions of strategists
may be approaching a 52-week low. Harvey Isen, president of
Sun America Asset Management Co., says, "They are grossly
overpaid."
   Strategists are from the top-down school of analysis. They
look at dozens of macro-economic trends, from Federal Reserve
policy to market sentiment, and then rush out their buy or
sell recommendations on classes of assets -- stocks, bonds,
cash -- and industry groups to clients. Some manage "model
portfolios" on paper; others, such as Ms. Garzarelli, put
their ideas to work running investment funds. Strategists'
reputations are usually built on market timing -- being in
the right industry group or the right asset before the
stampede.
   But the stock and bond markets have been relatively flat
this year. Successful portfolio managers say they are beating
the averages with an eclectic group of growth stocks, not by
switching between asset classes or industry groups.
   Despite yesterday's record-high close of 2969.80 for the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, the broader stock market,
measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index, is up only
3.4% this year. "The stock market in aggregate hasn't done a
whole lot, and interest rates haven't done a whole lot," Greg
Smith, chief strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
says. "The real action has been finding the stocks that will
work."
   But he predicts, "Let the market come under two weeks of
pressure, and they {portfolio managers} will start calling up
their favorite strategist."
   The managers aren't picking up their phones yet. At
Brandywine Asset Management in Delaware, portfolio managers
rely "more on bottom-up work by {securities} analysts than
strategists," Paul Ehrlichman, a vice president at the firm,
says. "The strategist is an arm-chair quarterback," he adds.
"You can't move money around like they do."
   As securities analysts who track the earnings for
individual stocks fall back into favor, money managers are
questioning whether market strategists still wield too much
influence within Wall Street firms. They worry that
securities analysts may shy away from certain stock
selections, because of the strategists' view on trends in
interest rates and auto sales, for example. Money managers
claim that strategists may carry too much weight at firms
such as Prudential-Bache, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co.
of America; Merrill Lynch; PaineWebber Inc., and Goldman
Sachs.
   "A lot of Wall Street firms are hung up because
strategists are bearish," Brooke Cobb, senior portfolio
manager at Putnam Cos., says. "Analysts have a difficult time
going in front of strategists, or they get tied into" the
valuation models "that drive these guys."
   Strategists from all four firms agree they have some
degree of influence over analysts, but all insisted that the
cooperation is positive and that analysts within their firms
operate with a high degree of independence. "I listen to the
analysts more than they listen to me," Merrill Lynch's Mr.
Clough says.
   Portfolio managers aren't finding investment ideas in the
reams of research on industry groups, either. Many say they
use a variety of individual analysts, who are often at
smaller firms and aren't involved in what is known as
maintenance research -- the ground-out reports on the auto
industry, for example. Sun America's Mr. Isen gives high
marks to stock pickers who roam across industry lines: Jane
Gilday, senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co., and James
Ruf, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., for example.
"They are absolutely, unequivocally not maintenance people.
They are idea people," he says. "I've never understood why
there are 30 chemical analysts, or 30 paper analysts."
   There are other reasons why money managers say they worry
even about analysts whose job it is to track individual
stocks. Brokerage firms have been slashing costs since the
1987 stock market crash. And research hasn't emerged
unscathed.
   "The problem is that more senior people are doing a lot of
corporate finance," Kenneth Greiner, partner at Dalton,
Greiner, Hartman, Maher &amp; Co., a money management firm, says.
"The big bucks can be made by doing an underwriting or a deal
on the corporate finance side. That's where the bread is
buttered right now. In terms of making money stock-picking,
that's not their focus anymore."
   Mr. Ehrlichman of Brandywine Asset Management says: "It
seems like Wall Street {research} is in disarray. They are a
little confused about how to add value."
   Even so, strategists say they are still in demand. Byron
Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist for Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co., says he has seen more clients come knocking on his door
this year than ever before.
   Mr. Wien, whose outlook reports read like essays, says he
knows that all market strategy comes down to one thing:
picking stocks. "There are some strategists that never talk
about stocks, some talk only about where the market is going,
and some talk only about industry groups," he says. "But in
the end, {money managers} have to buy a stock, and I give
them stocks."
