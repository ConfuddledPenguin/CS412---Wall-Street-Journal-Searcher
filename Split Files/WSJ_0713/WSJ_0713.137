   Air France said its board approved an additional six
options on Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s 747-400, the
superlong-range version of the aircraft. Financial details
weren't disclosed.
   Air France said deliveries are to be made between January
1996 and April 1999, in either the passenger or Combi
version; the latter carries both passengers and cargo on the
main deck, while all versions carry cargo in the belly
compartment below the main deck.

   Air France said it already held 20 firm orders and 33
options for the 747-400, with the first, a passenger model,
to be delivered in February 1991. Of the 20 firm orders, 11
are for the passenger model, four for the Combi and five for
the freighter model.
   As it reviews its fleet needs, the carrier said it will
advise Boeing about models that will be represented among the
39 optioned aircraft.
