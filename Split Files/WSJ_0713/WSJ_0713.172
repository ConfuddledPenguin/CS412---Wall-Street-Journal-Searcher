   LONDON -- Lord Rayner, chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer PLC, is
to resign on March 31, 1991, the end of the company's current
fiscal year and the day after his 65th birthday.
   In a statement, the company said Richard Greenbury, chief
executive officer, would succeed Lord Rayner as chairman.
Lord Rayner, who joined the company in 1953 and has been
chairman since July 1984, will also retire from the board.

   Addressing the annual meeting yesterday, Lord Rayner said
Marks &amp; Spencer's broad-based merchandising strengths mean
the company "has no need to join the list of retailers
forecasting disappointing results."
   Lord Rayner said that, in common with the rest of the
British retailing industry, furniture sales are slow in
center-city outlets but are performing well in other areas.
Unseasonal weather in June depressed sales of summer-fashion
goods, he said, but other departments -- including lingerie,
socks, underwear, and clothing for children and babies -- are
making "substantial gains."
   The company is investing 350 million pounds (about $630
million) in the United Kingdom this year and will open
450,000 square feet of selling space. The property portfolio,
consisting of owned and long-lease properties in prime
retailing positions, represents a major strength, the
official noted.
   Overseas, expansion is planned in continental Europe,
where about 40 new stores are scheduled to be opened in the
next five years. Sales in the company's four Hong Kong stores
for the fiscal year to date are more than double last year's
level.
   In Japan, sales are 30% above year-earlier levels, Lord
Rayner said. Full-year sales in North America are expected to
exceed 500,000 pounds ($895,000), he added.
