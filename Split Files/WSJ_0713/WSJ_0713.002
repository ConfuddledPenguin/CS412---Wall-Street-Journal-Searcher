   MOSCOW -- The first attack came two years ago, at a
computer training center. Although the invader was quickly
neutralized, "we realized this was a real menace," recalls
one of the Soviet defenders.
   The intruder was a "virus," a software program designed to
infiltrate a computer's memory and disrupt the system, that
somehow got into the center's personal computers.

   The event alarmed Soviet computer scientists; though
common in the West, this form of computer sabotage had been
little known in the East. After all, a computer virus needs
computers -- and computers haven't exactly been plentiful
here.
   But the number of Soviet computers is growing, and with
them are beginning to appear viruses and other hazards
familiar in Western computing. Since 1988, Soviet computer
scientists have recorded 15 virus attacks around their
country. Soviet media have even reported on the disgruntled
Volga Auto Works employee who sabotaged the computer running
a car-production line.
   To cope, a tiny industry is emerging here, much as in the
West, to offer protection for harried computer managers.
   After years of unconcern, "there's a lot of interest" in
viruses now among Soviet computer scientists, says Prof.
Seymour Goodman, a specialist on Soviet computing at the
University of Arizona. While Soviet expertise in this area is
still limited, he notes, "they seem to sense it's something
they ought to know about."
   Even the KGB is interested. One Soviet computer scientist
says he was questioned by his country's intelligence service,
which wondered if the viruses could be Western sabotage. He
told them that was implausible -- but that their suspicions
were understandable.
   The U.S. Army's Center for Signals Warfare recently
announced plans to study the feasibility of computer-virus
warfare. The $50,000 technical study isn't aimed specifically
at the Soviet Union or any other country, says Richard
Poisel, the center's research chief. But he adds, though he
doesn't know for sure, that the Soviet military may have
begun similar studies.
   Viruses appeared in the U.S. in the early 1980s. Initially
a hackers' diversion, they can be as innocuous as a program
that flashes a rude message on the monitor or as destructive
as one that garbles a computer's memory. Typically, they
escape notice as part of a legitimate program, and they
spread from computer to computer on floppy disks or over
electronic networks.
   Moscow once insisted that computer viruses were a uniquely
Western problem. Computer hackers, mischievous or not, are
rare in the Soviet Union, as are the machines themselves (the
country has at most one million personal computers -- about
as many as in one average U.S. state). Big computer networks,
a common vector for viruses in the West, are rarer still.
   Besides, computers occupied until recently a sacrosanct
place in Kremlin ideology: They were regarded as space-age
management tools that would perfect communism, giving Soviet
central planners unprecedented power to monitor and direct
the nation's economy.
   Thus, the awakening was a rude one. "We have read some
incredible stories of computer viruses causing billions of
dollars of losses to computer centers in some remote
capitalist countries, but we never took them seriously,"
wrote several researchers at the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Science's Program Systems Institute, in an article published
in an academy journal.
   The big computer-research institute was the first to
discover that the Soviet Union isn't immune to viruses. In
the summer of 1988, it was running a computer training
facility outside Moscow for bright youngsters from 20
countries. One personal computer began to malfunction,
apparently stuck on a command to keep restarting itself.
Subsequent research found that the cause was a virus,
imported inadvertently on a floppy disk carried by one of the
foreign computer students. Institute specialists, who
expunged the virus after 18 hours, found the experience
disturbing. "The PC seemed to have a will of its own," the
scientists wrote. "We felt like doctors confronted with an
unknown disease."
   Sergei Abramov, an institute official interviewed here,
says that since then he and his colleagues have recorded 14
other cases of virus attack in the Soviet Union. The targets
included an institute that designs civilian-aircraft engines,
and another that designs components for the Soviets' ES range
of mainframe computers. Almost all the viruses whose origins
could be traced emanated from the West. One, however, came
from Bulgaria. Called Dark Avenger, it was carried into the
Soviet Union by a Soviet marine-research vessel plying the
Black Sea near Bulgaria; the ship's computers were using
floppy disks obtained locally.
   In response, the country's computer labs and a few private
cooperatives have begun mobilizing. Already, computer
specialists say, as many as 150 "anti-virus" programs are
circulating in the Soviet Union -- some pirated from the
West, others designed locally.
   But sometimes the cure can be worse than the disease. An
early version of an anti-virus program designed by Mr.
Abramov's colleagues was itself found to be inadvertently
carrying a virus. The researchers didn't intend the program
for release, but in a country where software piracy abounds,
the virus quickly spread outside the lab on a pirated floppy
disk.
   Now, Mr. Abramov explains, he can track the pirated
version's spread around the Soviet Union by reports of its
accompanying virus. "The last time we saw it," he says, "was
in Vladivostok."
