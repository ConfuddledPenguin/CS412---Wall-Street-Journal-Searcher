   The savings-and-loan scandal would seem to be a golden
issue for Tim Roemer, the Democratic nominee against
Republican Rep. John Hiler of Indiana. Rep. Hiler serves on
the House Banking Committee, has voted with and received
campaign contributions from the thrift industry, and has
never had an easy race since his 1980 election.
   But the Democrat has a problem: His most recent job was
working for Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini, one of the
now-notorious Keating Five group of lawmakers accused of
intervening with regulators on behalf of a high-powered
thrift executive.

   Mr. Roemer's predicament symbolizes Democrats'
frustrations over the S&amp;L issue so far this year. On the
surface, the issue seems heaven-sent: a hugely expensive
scandal they can argue was nurtured during Republican
administrations, was made possible by Republican policies and
has gotten worse since a Republican president declared last
year that it was fixed.
   But so far, the Democrats have had little success at
translating outrage at the scandal into a political issue.
And where it has emerged as an issue, they have been just as
likely as Republicans to be hurt by it. After all, former
House Speaker James Wright and former House Democratic Whip
Tony Coehlo were both closely identified with the S&amp;L crisis,
and four of the Keating Five are Democrats. Moreover, many
Democrats in Congress voted for some of the legislation now
being blamed for helping cause the crisis.
   A new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll points
up both the potential and the problems that the thrift crisis
holds for Democrats. The poll shows that by a margin of 39%
to 17%, voters hold the GOP more responsible than the
Democrats for the crisis. And they are evenly split over
President Bush's handling of the problem; 38% approve, 37%
disapprove.
   Yet the survey also shows that a majority of voters blame
the crisis much more on thrift-industry executives than on
anyone in Washington, Republican or Democrat. And in an
especially disheartening finding for the Democrats, voters
split almost evenly over whether they trust the GOP or the
Democrats more to handle the crisis.
   Over the long run, however, many observers think the
crisis will benefit the Democrats. Democratic National
Chairman Ron Brown has already issued a clarion call to his
party's candidates to seize on the scandal, and GOP political
theorist Kevin Phillips says "the general context helps the
Democrats." The issue has emerged in a half-dozen to a dozen
congressional races this year and is likely to be even more
important in 1992. "It's an issue that's only going to get
bigger," says Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the Republicans'
House campaign committee.
   The pollsters who conducted the Journal/NBC survey, Peter
Hart, a Democrat, and Robert Teeter, a Republican, say voters
"have figured out the villains, and they want to punish them.
They see no heroes, but above all they don't want to get
penalized or have to pay for the greed of others."
   Clearly, the poll shows that many voters are angry at the
thrift industry -- and aren't very happy about the Bush
administration's approach to the problem so far. By 79% to
13%, they favor appointing a special prosecutor to
investigate the industry, and by 60% to 30% they would favor
doubling the number of federal auditors examining thrifts'
books.
   Moreover, 43% even favor getting rid of S&amp;Ls entirely by
forcing them to become commercial banks; about the same
percentage oppose such a step. A substantial majority, 57%,
opposes reducing federal deposit insurance from the current
$100,000 per account, a level that some experts believe
contributed to the crisis. Some GOP lawmakers at least
privately favor reducing the coverage.
   Some of that voter anger was evident at a Fourth of July
parade in Molalla, Ore. "All of those S&amp;L crooks should be in
jail," declared Richard Cutler, a retired postal worker in
Salem. Yet even as Mr. Cutler was talking, two people passing
before him showed how the issue hasn't yet matured
politically.
   The two were GOP Rep. Denny Smith and his opponent, Mike
Kopetski, who represents one of the Democrats' best shots at
using the S&amp;L crisis to knock off a GOP incumbent.
   The ammunition is there. Until 1987, Rep. Smith was a
director of an Oregon thrift that crashed, costing the
government $113 million. He also lobbied with regulators on
behalf of S&amp;L executives who contributed to his campaign, and
he sought immunity from lawsuits for himself and other thrift
directors. He denies any wrongdoing but concedes that his
membership on the board of American Federal Savings &amp; Loan of
Salem was unwise "because it's a perceived conflict of
interest."
   Yet so far, at least, the issue doesn't seem to be cutting
very deeply. Fairly typical is the attitude of Roger Jordan,
city manager of the Oregon town of Dallas, where one local
thrift failed and was later sold. "All of us are touched by
it, but I don't have anyone to blame," he says.
   Some Democratic strategists believe Mr. Kopetski should do
something dramatic, such as filing an ethics complaint
against Rep. Smith. But Kopetski aides say they think
criticisms of Rep. Smith would have much more credibility if
someone else -- the media, or people hurt directly by the
demise of the institution on whose board Rep. Smith sat --
makes a case against him.
   That way, they say, the issue would have more punch when
Mr. Kopetski does take it up directly. "It's a legitimate
issue, and I'm sure it will be used in our campaign," says
the candidate, who came within 707 votes of beating Rep.
Smith in 1988. "But it will be used later."
   In contrast to Mr. Kopetski, Indiana challenger Mr. Roemer
has tried to make the thrift crisis an issue against Rep.
Hiler. But his attacks so far have misfired. After a
newspaper published an interview in which the Democrat
assailed Mr. Hiler for voting with the thrift industry on a
crucial issue, Mr. Hiler was able to rebut the charge by
noting that the vote in question took place before he was
elected. (Mr. Roemer says he was misquoted.)
   Rep. Hiler and his campaign aides are hitting back,
stressing Mr. Roemer's own vulnerabilities. "He was under the
tutelage of the master of the S&amp;Ls -- Dennis DeConcini," says
Pat Hinton, Rep. Hiler's campaign manager. (Mr. Roemer
stresses that he didn't advise the senator on banking
matters.) This week, the Hiler campaign began airing
television spots attacking Mr. Roemer's credibility on the
S&amp;L issue.
   In California's Central Valley, there's another likely GOP
target, Rep. Charles "Chip" Pashayan. In 1986, Mr. Pashayan
received $26,000 in campaign contributions from Charles
Keating and his associates. But virtually the only time
Democratic challenger Calvin Dooley publicly raised the issue
was at a recent press conference -- in Washington.
   Some Republicans, of course, also have been maladroit in
firing S&amp;L salvos. Although Texas Democratic Rep. Jim
Chapman's 1985 campaign benefited from independent
expenditures from S&amp;L political action committees that are
currently under federal investigation, his GOP opponent,
businessman Hamp Hodges, says he needs more time to research
the matter before he uses it in his campaign.
   While challengers are still figuring out how to capitalize
on the issue, some Democratic incumbents have problems of
their own. Once seen as a plum assignment, serving as a
senior Democrat on the House Banking Committee has now become
a political liability for Illinois Rep. Frank Annunzio, who
heads the National Republican Congressional Committee's list
of targeted incumbents.
   "As current chairman of the House subcommittee that
oversees the savings and loan industry, Frank Annunzio is
part of the savings and loan problem," charges his opponent,
Republican state Sen. Walter Dudycz. For his part, Rep.
Annunzio says Republicans are after him because he held
highly publicized hearings on possible misconduct by the
president's son, Neil Bush, as director of a failed S&amp;L.
   Rep. Annunzio's northwest Chicago district is generally
considered a Democratic stronghold, and many voters there
take attitudes similar to that of Wayne Hanson, a management
representative for a painting and drywall company. "There's
dirty laundry that can always be found on both sides," he
says.
   Still, the crusty, 75-year-old Rep. Annunzio is concerned
enough that he recently committed an act of political
exorcism. He had the portrait of former Banking Committee
Chairman Fernand St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat and a
major figure in the S&amp;L debacle, removed from the committee
room. In its place, Mr. Annunzio hung a white banner that
blared PUT THE S&amp;L CROOKS IN JAIL.
   Banking Committee Democrats are also coming under fire for
their access to political contributions from the thrift
industry. In Georgia, Sam Jones, a former minister and family
counselor favored to win next week's Republican primary, has
put up billboards urging Democratic Rep. Doug Barnard to give
back $20,000 that he received from Mr. Keating and his
associates in 1986. "Either Mr. Barnard was asleep at the
wheel or he was taking a little payola," Mr. Jones says.
   Rep. Barnard, though, believes that the issue hasn't
caught on in his district. Voters are saying "very little" to
him about the S&amp;Ls, he says, because "they don't understand
the problem." Although he says "I'm not trying to minimize
the intellect of the voters," he believes that most lack the
"time and inclination" to examine the issue and decide who's
at fault.
   If that is true, it has worked, at least so far, to
President Bush's advantage. The Journal/NBC survey shows that
only a tiny 3% minority currently believe that Mr. Bush is
most responsible for the S&amp;L mess.
   But many observers expect that figure to rise as time goes
on, the problems become more apparent and the political anger
rises. If so, Democratic Chairman Brown hopes that the issue
will someday evolve into a major weapon against the
Republicans. Ultimately, he predicts, Mr. Bush is going to be
"in real trouble."
