   WASHINGTON -- House and Senate conferees debating
oil-spill legislation agreed to require double hulls for new
tankers and to phase them in for most existing ships by 2010.
   Agreement on this once-contentious issue came after little
discussion among the lawmakers. The requirement once was
opposed strongly by many oil companies, which contended that
any costly retrofitting should await further study. Recently,
however, the industry has come to accept double hulls as
unavoidable, especially in light of the rash of oil spills in
U.S. waters in the past 18 months.

   The provisions approved by the conferees would establish
schedules for retrofitting existing vessels, generally
requiring the largest and oldest ships to be equipped with
double hulls first. Extra time would be allotted for tankers
that transfer oil to other ships far offshore, tankers with
double bottoms or sides, and barges and other ships that
operate in inland waterways. Congressional aides said much of
the existing fleet will be retired rather than retrofitted.
   Vessels weighing less than 5,000 tons could be exempt from
the double-hull requirement entirely if they have double
bottoms or sides that the secretary of transportation
determines would be as effective as double hulls for
preventing oil leaks.
   Environmental groups viewed the conferees' action as a
mixed bag. While they have long favored double hulls, they
had pushed for a more aggressive retrofit schedule, and they
particularly opposed exceptions for inland barges and other
ships.
   Agreement on double hulls moves the conferees close to
approval of a comprehensive oil spill measure. Conferees
removed a major hurdle to the bill last month, when they
rejected provisions that would have provided for U.S.
participation in an international treaty limiting shippers'
liability in spills.
   Among other provisions, the bill would raise federal
liability limits for tankers, barges and oil facilities, and
it would improve contingency planning for oil spills. Federal
cleanup and damage-assessment costs, plus compensation for
damages, beyond the liability limits would be paid out of a
five-cents-a barrel tax on domestic and imported oil. That
fee has been collected since Jan. 1.
