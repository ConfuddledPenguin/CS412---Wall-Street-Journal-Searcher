   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. posted an 11%
increase in second-quarter and six-months profit despite
roughly flat sales in both periods.
   The company said net income rose to $252 million in the
quarter, or 86 cents a share, compared with $228 million, or
78 cents a share, in the 1989 second quarter. Year-earlier
earnings per share were adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split
paid in May. Sales were flat at $3.18 billion.

   Results were in line with analysts' expectations.
   Westinghouse doesn't break out results of its various
businesses, but said pretax operating profit increased
substantially in both its Energy and Utility Systems unit and
its Group W broadcasting business. For about a year
Westinghouse has been booking increased power-generation
equipment orders, much of it from independent producers. The
company attributed the improved performance at its
broadcasting segment to recently acquired radio stations.
   Westinghouse also said operating profit at its Financial
Services segment rose slightly from a year earlier. Within
that segment, the company said lower results at its
Westinghouse Credit business partly offset significantly
higher operating profit at its community development
business. Pretax profit at its Commercial division also
improved.
   Westinghouse said operating profit increased slightly at
its Electronic Systems segment and was higher in its
Industries business.
   In the latest six months, net was $462 million, or $1.57 a
share, compared with net of $417 million, or $1.43 a share,
adjusted for the split. Sales declined to $6.04 billion from
$6.06 billion.
