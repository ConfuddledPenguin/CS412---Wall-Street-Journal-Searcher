   TOKYO -- Japan's labor shortage has become so acute that
one company is offering recruits a brand new car.
   Maruwa Orimono K.K., a small producer of synthetic-fiber
fabrics in western Japan, said it took the step "to enhance
our corporate image and thus to help secure workers."

   While it has been common for companies to offer corporate
housing to attract workers to crowded Japanese cities, this
appears to be the first time a company has offered cars as an
employment incentive. (Kentucky Fried Chicken recently sent
some of its first-year employees on an all-expenses-paid trip
to Hawaii.)
   A spokesman for the company, which has 110 employees, says
the labor supply situation in the area is "so bad" that for
the past three years the company hasn't been able to hire a
single high-school graduate. He says that with major
companies hiring away most fresh graduates from the region,
the ratio of job offers to applicants in the area now stands
at about three to one. It is far higher than the nationwide
figure of 1.41, which is the highest in the past 16 years.
   After a three-month probation period, a Maruwa Orimono
recruit is entitled to the car, but the recruit must be
younger than 35 years.
   Recruits can choose any car they like with a price ceiling
of about 1.5 million yen ($10,095). They aren't required to
return the car if they quit.
   Since the decision was publicized in a local newspaper
Monday, the spokesman said, two or three people have made
inquiries with the company, but by Tuesday no one had been
hired yet.
