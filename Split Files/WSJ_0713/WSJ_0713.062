   MOSCOW -- Just when President Mikhail Gorbachev seemed to
have stitched the divided Soviet Communist Party together,
Boris Yeltsin has started tearing it apart, perhaps for good.
   Mr. Yeltsin, the radical former Politburo member who was
recently elected president of the Russian republic, announced
last night that he is resigning from the Communist Party. "I
cannot be guided in my decisions by (the party) alone," he
told delegates at the party's 28th Congress in Moscow. As an
elected government leader, "I must obey the will of the
people," he said.

   Mr. Yeltsin has a huge popular following in the nation,
and his decision seems likely to spark a wave of defections
from the party. Within an hour of his announcement, several
leaders of the radical Democratic Platform grouping inside
the Communist Party announced that they were formally
splitting and intended to set up an independent party.
   Such moves come as a blow for Mr. Gorbachev, who has
struggled to maintain party unity in the face of mounting
difficulties. The Soviet leader has spent the past 11 days at
the congress fighting off a hard-line conservative challenge
to his rule and forging elaborate compromises between right
and left.
   Until Mr. Yeltsin's announcement, he seemed to have
largely succeeded. Relying on personal loyalty and party
discipline, Mr. Gorbachev won endorsement for his policies
and was easily re-elected party leader. Just Wednesday,
congress delegates overwhelmingly approved his candidate for
the post of deputy leader, Vladimir Ivashko, rebuffing the
hard-line Politburo member Yegor Ligachev, who was also
running for the post.
   "There is every reason to believe that the (Communist
Party) will avoid the lot of its East European sisters and be
able to prevent a split and preserve its influence among the
grass roots," crowed the official Tass news agency after that
vote. Even some would-be defectors seemed happier. "The
congress started on the right and is finishing on the left,"
said Georgy Gusev, a Democratic Platform member. "I think
that most people will stay in the party and continue to
fight."
   But the decision to quit the party by Mr. Yeltsin and the
other radicals, including the mayor of Leningrad, Anatoly
Sobchak, and Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, rector of Moscow's
Higher Party School, has thrown such predictions into doubt.
Just 2% of congress delegates are Democratic Platform
members, but the group claims a large nationwide following.
   Not all its supporters have decided to join them, however.
Mr. Gusev told the Congress -- to loud applause -- that the
statement by the group's leaders hadn't been coordinated with
other members, and he personally wouldn't leave the party.
Prior to the congress, radicals had weighed a mass walkout
and a formal split with the party.
   Whatever happens to the attempt to set up an alternative,
the Communist Party -- and Mr. Gorbachev -- seem headed for
turbulent days. Both he and his liberal aide, Alexander
Yakovlev, had publicly urged the radicals not to leave, but
to stay in the party to help fight the increasingly
vociferous conservative majority. If a formal split does
materialize, it will leave Mr. Gorbachev at the head of a
rump party dominated by hard-line Marxists and provincial
officials deeply ambivalent about his reform program. But the
Soviet leader didn't appear immediately fazed by the
prospect, coolly chairing the congress proceedings as if
nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.
   Behind Mr. Yeltsin's move lies a growing national
disaffection with the party, which itself concedes that it
has lagged behind many of the changes in Soviet society
introduced by Mr. Gorbachev. In a self-critical statement
approved by delegates this week, the congress declared that
the party "was taken unawares" by problems such as growing
ethnic conflicts. It blamed the leadership for "failing to
use all the posibilities for radical transformation."
   But Mr. Yeltsin, who has hinted for weeks that he might
resign, was demanding more than just a mea culpa. In a
hardhitting speech to the Congress last week, he warned
delegates that the party faced "historic defeat" at the hands
of the people unless it agreed to a drastic overhaul. He
called for the party to drop the word Communist from its
name, relinquish control over the armed forces, the KGB and
Soviet factories, and create a "union of democratic forces"
to lead the nation out of crisis.
   "Those who think about other variants should look at the
fate of the Communist Parties in Eastern Europe," he told the
congress. "They were separated from the people . . . and
found themselves sidetracked."
   Mr. Gorbachev did manage to swing the Congress closer to
some of Mr. Yeltsin's positions. One resolution it approved
proposes that "all champions of the socialist idea should
rally within a broad coalition." But on such key issues as
Communist influence in the army and industry, delegates
refused to approve any changes, following the lead of Mr.
Gorbachev.
   Even some prominent reformists in the party expressed
quiet disappointment with the lack of radicalism at the
congress. "There are so many resolutions and some of them
contradict each other," Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin said
in an interview. "I think that the decisions of the 28th
Congress have exhausted themselves. They have already been
overtaken by life . . . I think everybody now understands
there is a need for a radical turn in goals."
   In many ways, Mr. Yeltsin seems better attuned to the
national mood than Mr. Gorbachev. The one-day strike by
thousands of coal miners around the nation Wednesday was
driven by demands for a thorough reform of the party along
the lines proposed by Mr. Yeltsin.
   "It's good that there's a split," said Yuri Boldyrev, one
of the miners' strike leaders from the Ukrainian town of
Donetsk. "But it would be very good if the party is
disbanded." Mr. Boldyrev said he now expects miners in the
region to move rapidly to shut down Communist Party offices
on mine premises.
   Popular reaction to the largely conservative majority at
the congress has been one of alarm and indignation. "For the
first time it has become clear what our bosses are like. For
the first time it has become obvious why perestroika is
skidding," one woman, Valentina Larina, complained in a
phone-in about the congress organized by the paper Evening
Moscow. Another caller, Nikolai Minayev, an invalid who
fought in World War II, complained that his bed had broken
and he couldn't afford a new one. "Ask the congress what I
fought for," he griped.
   Many such ordinary people look to Mr. Yeltsin, 59 years
old, as their champion. Since being unceremoniously ousted
from the Politburo in 1987, he has fought bitter battles
against the entrenched party bureaucrats whom he claims are
out to get him. Last year he staged an astonishing comeback,
a novelty in Soviet political life, by winning 90% of the
vote in elections to the Soviet Parliament. He completed his
triumph this May, when he was elected president of the
Russian republic, a position of enormous power.
   Until his resignation announcement at the congress, he
appeared to be taking pains to get along with Mr. Gorbachev.
The Soviet leader originally brought Mr. Yeltsin onto the
Politburo, giving him the job of Moscow party leader. But the
relationship between the two men quickly deteriorated, with
Mr. Yeltsin accusing the Soviet president of betrayal after
his ouster. In turn, Mr. Gorbachev dismissed Mr. Yeltsin as a
hothead.
   Following Mr. Yeltsin's election as Russian president,
however, the two men have appeared eager to heal the rift. At
a meeting of leaders of the republics soon after Mr.
Yeltsin's election, Mr. Gorbachev went to shake Mr. Yeltsin's
hand first and congratulate him on his victory. According to
people present, Mr. Yeltsin said: "I am with you." Mr.
Gorbachev quickly replied: "I hear that with pleasure."
