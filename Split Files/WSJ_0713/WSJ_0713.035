   CHICAGO -- Centel Corp.'s strategy of focusing on its
local-phone and cellular communications operations is
proceeding "right on track," said John P. Frazee Jr.,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   In an interview -- conducted before GTE Corp.'s about $6
billion bid yesterday for another telecommunications concern,
Contel Corp. -- Mr. Frazee outlined Centel's efforts to
strengthen its cellular capabilities, seek regulatory changes
for its telephone operations, and boost its technological
position in an industry that he expects to prove "more and
more competitive."

   GTE's Contel offer pushed up the stocks of many cellular
and telephone concerns yesterday, and Mr. Frazee's enthusiasm
for the industry's prospects seem buttressed by yesterday's
developments. Contel closed at $36.875, up $2.25, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   Mr. Frazee also addressed the concerns recently voiced by
both major ratings agencies about the company's near-term
prospects. Moody's Investors Service recently downgraded
about $1.2 billion in Centel debt, citing the company's
"aggressive expansion of its cellular operations."
   Moody's said it thinks the "capital expenditure
requirements, external financing burden, and earnings
pressure accompanying the development of these properties
will result in increased business risk," although it noted
that the cellular operations "can provide Centel with
considerable cash flow and profit potential over the longer
term." Standard &amp; Poor's expressed similar concerns.
   Much of Centel's debt stems from the company's $775
million acquisition of United Telecom Inc.'s cellular-phone
operations in 1988 -- a move that vaulted it into the top
ranks of the fledgling industry. The leverage is also linked
to Centel's subsequent outlays to solidify its position
through construction and staff increases, as well as an
additional $225 million in smaller cellular acquisitions.
   "Any time your debt is increased, risk is increased," Mr.
Frazee said. "I certainly can't dispute" the rating
companies' contention that Centel's enlarged debt has
increased its downside exposure. But "we believe the ultimate
rewards of the cellular communications business far and away
justify the attendant risks," he said.
   In the United Telecom deal, Centel paid an average of
about $93 a "pop," the industry term for potential
subscribers. Analysts now put the value of those holdings at
between $175 and $225 a pop.
   The cellular operations "may be double their worth," says
Mr. Frazee, but "we don't think they're anywhere near the
longterm value they're going to have."
   Mr. Frazee says the company's cellular operations have
recently achieved a positive cash flow, on an operating
basis, although it hadn't originally expected to reach that
mark until the end of the year. And "we look forward to
positive earnings before interest and taxes by the end of
next year," also ahead of original plan.
   The cellular industry "is proving itself to be more than
just a service for the business person or the affluent."
Propelling the growth is an ongoing decline in the price of
cellular equipment for consumers.
   The industry, however, "isn't without its problems," Mr.
Frazee concedes. Regional-service quality concerns and
inadequate staffing, he feels, reflect a business that has
experienced "growth so rapid that the industry has suffered
from the same maladies cable TV suffered from" in its early
years. Centel's heavy outlays in cellular construction and
hiring are aimed at defusing such potential problems, he
said.
   The company, having repurchased about 16 million common
shares in the past two years under a 21-million-share
authorization, has slowed its share purchases as it spends on
internal projects, Mr. Frazee said. But he continues to feel
the stock's recent price doesn't fully reflect the company's
potential.
   So do some analysts. "We think that stock should be worth
at least $45 a share," said Joel D. Gross of Donaldson
Lufkin, adding that investors made skittish by the company's
current price-to-earnings ratio aren't properly valuing the
cellular operations' potential.
   In the interview, Mr. Frazee also discussed the efforts of
the company's Central Telephone unit to seek regulatory
changes. "Telecommunications consumers need a regulatory
scheme that rewards, rather than penalizes, efficiency," he
says.
   Central Telephone, which operates in nine states, is
seeking changes in utility regulations that would permit
incentives that would split cost savings between shareholders
and customers. The Central Telephone unit, which has spent
heavily to establish modern digital and fiber-optic networks,
would be in a strong competitive position if such incentives
are ultimately approved, Mr. Frazee said.
   Mr. Frazee said he expects Centel's second-quarter results
will be at the "high end" of the 10 cents to 15 cents a share
analysts have projected. "Given everything, I would
characterize us as having a strong quarter . . . It's hard
for people to understand because of the losses {being
incurred for expansion}, but we're right on track and very
pleased with our units."
