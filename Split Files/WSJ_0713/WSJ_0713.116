   NEW YORK -- Stock prices soared into record territory as
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan revived investors'
hopes for lower interest rates.
   Extending a practically uninterrupted climb that started
Tuesday, the stock market surged yesterday after Mr.
Greenspan said the Fed was poised to ease interest rates in
order to stave off what may be tightening credit conditions.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 37.13 points in
heavy trading to close at a record 2969.80, easily breaking
the previous high of 2935.89 set June 15. Trading volume of
211.5 million shares was the heaviest since May.
   Bond prices also rose on Mr. Greenspan's comments, while
the dollar fell sharply. The prospect of lower U.S. interest
rates, while bullish for bonds, erodes the dollar's appeal
compared with investments in higher-yielding foreign
currencies.
   Investors had almost given up hope that the Fed would ease
rates soon because of growing evidence of the economy's slow
but steady growth. But Mr. Greenspan, in suggesting the Fed
might soon ease, cited an inadvertent credit tightening,
rather than any need to stimulate a weak economy. The Fed
chairman said he sees evidence that loan rates are rising
relative to the cost of money, independent of any Fed action.
   Buoyed by the prospect of lower rates, some cyclical
stocks that track the economy and haven't participated in the
recent stock rally weighed in with healthy gains. The issues
included Phelps Dodge, Fluor and Ford. Energy stocks were
also strong on the continued rise in oil prices.
   The two-day, 79-point burst brings the industrials
tantalizingly close to the magical 3000 level. But A.C.
Moore, research director at Argus Research, believes the
market is more prone to slip than to keep surging right now.
   "Interest rates remain the key to the market," Mr. Moore
said, "and it's still a time where surprises on earnings will
be on the down side. So before I'd expect a very significant
increase in stock prices, I'd need to see interest rates go
down substantially." He said, "I think there was something of
an overreaction by equities" to Mr. Greenspan's remarks
yesterday.
   Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers, questions whether the Fed will follow
through quickly on the remarks.
   Mr. Greenspan "has been under enormous pressure the last
two days, hearing all the feedback from congressmen on how
tight credit is," Mr. Spence said. "Under that pressure, he
is trying to be conciliatory. He said the Fed is poised. The
operative word is poised. They will put liquidity into the
system to offset a credit contraction, if necessary, but it
wasn't a commitment."
   Also, Mr. Spence notes that none of the other major
indexes reached records yesterday, and the number of
advancing stocks hasn't overwhelmed the decliners.
   Mr. Spence, however, doesn't doubt that the Dow Jones
industrials could reach 3000, given the nature of the market.
"You have to take it stock by stock," he said. "Each stock in
here has its own trend. . . . Stock selection has been more
important than market-timing."
   In the bond market, "This was `Thank You, Alan Greenspan
Day,'" said Roberta D. Olson, fixed-income portfolio manager
at Banc One Asset Management Corp., Columbus, Ohio. Prices of
long-term Treasury bonds rose 3/4 of a point, or $7.50 for
each $1,000 face amount.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners,
987 to 545.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.49%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
dropped to 1.6340 German marks and 147.30 yen, from 1.6560
marks and 148.50 yen Wednesday.
