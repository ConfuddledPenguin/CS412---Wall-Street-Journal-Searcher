   NEW YORK -- Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s sales-optimism index
rose for the first time in five quarters, as 67% of
executives in a survey predicted increased third-quarter
sales.
   Only 7% of the 1,536 respondents predicted lower sales,
and 26% foresaw no change.

   As a result, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's sales-optimism index stood
at 60 -- the difference in percentage points between the 67%
predicting increases and the 7% predicting decreases. For
last year's second quarter, the index stood at 74, but then
it fell four times and stood at 57 for this year's second
quarter.
   "Sales expectations have picked up, the profit outlook is
solid, fewer executives expect price increases, and new
orders are expected to be stronger," said Joseph W. Duncan,
corporate economist and chief statistician for Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, a business-information marketer.
   Even so, the company's profits-optimism index fell
slightly. Of 1,428 respondents to this part of the survey,
60% predicted an increase and 7% predicted a decrease in
earnings.
   Not all types of businesses were equally bullish about
sales. While manufacturers were more optimistic, Mr. Duncan
said, retailers were less so, the result of recent weakness
in retail sales.
   Expectations were mixed geographically, as well. Optimism
increased in New England, but remained lower than in any
other region. "At the same time, the mountain region, which
was the least optimistic in the third quarter last year,
posted the sharpest gains in 1990 third-quarter
expectations," Dun &amp; Bradstreet said. Indeed, the latest
optimism reading was stronger in the mountain states than
anywhere else.
   Among other survey findings:
                                                                                                       

   PROFITS: Manufacturers of nondurables were much more
bullish than in the previous quarter, and durable-goods
makers were slightly less optimistic. Fewer retailers were
bullish, and wholesalers' expectations were unchanged.
                                                                                                       

   PRICES: Expectations of higher selling prices lessened
from the previous quarter. Of 1,462 respondents, 34%
predicted higher prices and 4% lower prices, with 62% seeing
no change. Inflationary pressures have ebbed, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet said.
                                                                                                       

   INVENTORIES: Expectations of higher inventories lessened
for retailers, wholesalers and nondurables makers, but not
for makers of durable goods. Overall, 32% of respondents
predicted higher inventories, 15% predicted lower
inventories. The majority, 53%, foresaw no change.
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYEES: Optimism regarding employment rose, with 23% of
firms expecting increases in the third quarter, 6% expecting
decreases, and 71% expecting no change.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ORDERS: Manufacturers' optimism about receiving new
orders increased sharply. Of 622 respondents, 67% predicted
increases, 5% predicted decreases and 28% predicted no
change.
