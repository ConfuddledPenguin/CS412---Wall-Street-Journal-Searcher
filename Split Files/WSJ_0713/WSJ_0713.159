   NEW YORK -- Turner Corp. said its Turner Construction Co.
unit won seven construction contracts in the San Francisco
Bay area totaling $110 million in June.
   It said the contracts were a result of the unit's
expansion efforts in San Jose. For all of last year, Turner,
the nation's largest general builder, completed $3.6 billion
of work.
