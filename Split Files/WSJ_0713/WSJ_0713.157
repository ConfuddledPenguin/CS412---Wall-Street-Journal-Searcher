   Fisher-Price, a unit Quaker Oats Co., said it plans to
close its Holland, N.Y., manufacturing plant, idling 475
employees at the facility.
   Fisher-Price, the troubled toy business of the
Chicago-based packaged foods concern, also said it has
eliminated 245 jobs at its headquarters.

   Fisher-Price said the plant closing, which will occur
gradually between September and November, was necessary
because of excess capacity throughout its manufacturing
system and the continued decline in sales volume. The plant
makes a variety of plastic toys.
   The reduction in the headquarters staff was to "align the
size of our work force with the smaller size of our
business," Fisher-Price said.
   Fisher-Price said it will maintain a staff of 950
employees at its headquarters in East Aurora, N.Y. Following
the work force reductions, the company said its total staff
will be about 6,400.
   A spokesman for Quaker Oats said a charge will be taken in
connection with the closing. He added that "we will disclose
all write-downs associated with the {planned} Fisher-Price
spinoff when we announce year-end results for fiscal 1990."
As reported, Quaker Oats's board announced in April a plan to
spin off the Fisher-Price division to stockholders.
