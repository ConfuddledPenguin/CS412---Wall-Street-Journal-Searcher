   LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Raytheon Co. said its second-quarter
earnings increased 8.3% on a 2.5% sales jump, reflecting
healthy growth in its electronics, aircraft products and
energy services businesses.
   Net income for the quarter ended July 1 rose to $144.8
million, or $2.22 a share, from $133.7 million, or $2.03 per
share, the electronics, aircraft and missile manufacturer
said. Sales increased to $2.35 billion from $2.29 billion in
the second quarter of 1989.

   Raytheon said its backlog at the end of the quarter grew
to $9.23 billion, including orders from the U.S. government
worth $6.7 billion. That compares with a backlog in last
year's second quarter of $8.36 billion, including a
government backlog of $6.32 billion.
   The company said part of the growth came from its largest
business -- electronics -- which makes both defense and
nondefense systems for the government.
   During the quarter the company said it was awarded a $414
million contract from the Army to supply certain ground
control equipment to Italy. The contract helped Raytheon
avoid laying off hundreds of workers.
   The company also said that increased domestic orders and
reduced manufacturing costs improved profits in its Aircraft
Products segment, led by its Beach Aircraft Corp. unit. It
also noted that its Energy Services division benefited from
improved operations and an increased interest in enviromental
services.
   For the six months, earnings jumped 8% to $275.7 million
from $254.5 million in the year-ago period. Sales were $4.57
billion, up about 5% from last year's $4.36 billion.
