   LOS ANGELES -- Management Co. Entertainment Group said it
will delay a semiannual interest payment of about $1.4
million due Sunday on convertible subordinated debentures due
2009.
   The entertainment concern is currently in discussions with
G.E. Capital, a unit of General Electric Corp., about
extending and restructuring $72.5 million of bridge and
credit loans that mature tomorrow. G.E. Capital took steps to
block Management Co.'s interest payment to bondholders.

   On Tuesday, G.E. Capital advanced the company about $3
million to meet certain obligations of Management Co.'s
United Kingdom subsidiary.
   Management Co. is also negotiating with Virgin Group Ltd.,
a creditor and the largest shareholder of the company, about
restructuring and extending its debt.
