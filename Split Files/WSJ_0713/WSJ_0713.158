   Kimberly-Clark Corp. said operating earnings for the
second quarter rose 23% to $124.4 million, or $1.56 a share,
before a one-time charge.
   The charge of $44 million, or 55 cents a share, was
related to the pending sale of a Canadian unit, Spruce Falls
Power &amp; Paper Co. The charge caused net income to decline 21%
to $80.5 million, or $1.01 a share, from $101.3 million, or
$1.26 a share, a year earlier.

   The operating earnings exceeded analysts' expectations and
the stock market reacted enthusiastically. The stock soared
$4.625 to $82.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday.
   Analysts attributed the earnings surge to strong sales of
Kimberly-Clark's disposable diapers. The Dallas-based paper
and consumer products company said sales for the quarter rose
15% to $1.61 billion from $1.4 billion in the 1989 period.
   Operating results set records for the both the quarter and
the first half. Excluding the second-quarter charge, net
income for the six months improved 18% to $241.6 million, or
$3.02 per share. Revenue was up 13% to $3.19 billion.
