   TORONTO -- Abitibi-Price Inc., a forest products company,
said it plans to build a 400 million Canadian dollar
(US$345.2 million) recycled-newsprint mill in Scotland, in
partnership with two British newspaper publishing concerns.
   Abitibi, Daily Telegraph PLC and Mirror Group Newspapers
Ltd. agreed to acquire closely held Northern British
Newsprint Ltd., as the first stage in construction of the
mill. The acquisition price wasn't specified. Daily Telegraph
is 77%-owned by Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc., and Mirror
Group is controlled by Robert Maxwell. Officials at the two
companies couldn't be reached for comment.

   Abitibi will have a 50% stake in the company, which
developed the project and owns the site of the proposed mill.
The two newspaper concerns will each have a 25% stake in the
project, Abitibi said.
   The mill will convert about 270,000 metric tons of
newspapers and magazines a year into 220,000 metric tons of
100% recycled-fiber newsprint, Abitibi said. A metric ton is
equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. Abititi said construction
could begin in early 1991 and be complete within two years,
with 80% of the cost being raised through external financing
arrangements, including debt issues.
