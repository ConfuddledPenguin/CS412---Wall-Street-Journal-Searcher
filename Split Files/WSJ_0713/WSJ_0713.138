   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration said it
opposes requiring use of child-safety seats in planes because
the end result would be an increase in highway deaths.
   The FAA, at a congressional hearing on child-restraints,
cited a number of new studies to bolster its theory, which
left several congressmen incredulous. "This is a little
puzzling as to why the FAA is more concerned with highway
safety than aviation safety," said Rep. Jim Lightfoot (R.,
Iowa), who wrote legislation to require use of the seats on
planes for children under two years old.

   The FAA analysis goes like this: Requiring the seats for
small children would compel parents to buy airline tickets
for babies who now may be held on laps and fly free. The
higher costs, in turn, would prompt some families to drive to
their destinations rather than fly. And since driving is more
hazardous, more lives would be lost on highways than would be
saved in airplane crashes. Sen. Christopher Bond (R., Mo.)
co-authored the Lightfoot bill and testified yesterday at the
hearing, which was held by the House Aviation Subcommittee.
He said the FAA's reasoning was "totally unacceptable and
ridiculous." Carried to its extreme, he said, the FAA never
would have required oxygen masks, flame-retardant seats or
other safety improvements that raised the cost of flying.
Instead, "We'd allow airlines to sell standing-room-only
tickets," he said. "Imagine how many people that would take
off the highways."
   But Anthony Broderick, associate FAA administrator for
regulation and certification, told the panel that no other
rule the agency has considered "would have such a
diversionary impact." Requiring child-restraint seats would
result in one baby's life being saved on a plane over 10
years, but nine more people would be killed on the highways
than would otherwise be the case, according to a study by
Apogee Research Inc. commissioned by the FAA.
   Advocates of a child-restraint requirement testified that
the study underestimated the discounts airlines likely would
offer for babies, and thus overestimated the number of
families who would choose driving over flying.
