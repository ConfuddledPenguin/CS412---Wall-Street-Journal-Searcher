   A federal judge declared a partial mistrial in the case
against John A. Mulheren Jr. after a jury appeared to be
hopelessly deadlocked on 26 of the 30 counts against him.
   But U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum let stand
Mr. Mulheren's conviction on Tuesday of one count of
conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud.

   Judge Cedarbaum granted a mistrial motion by Thomas
Puccio, the New York attorney representing Mr. Mulheren. In
that motion, which the government opposed, Mr. Puccio argued
that jurors were repeatedly asking the same questions and
that one of the jurors had indicated he planned a vacation
later this week. "Pressure could be brought to bear because
of that vacation schedule," Mr. Puccio said.
   The jury could not determine whether Mr. Mulheren was
guilty of conducting a series of trades that the government
alleged were designed to generate tax losses for convicted
former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky's trading firm and to
help Mr. Boesky evade net-capital requirements.
   The government could retry Mr. Mulheren on those counts.
But E. Scott Gilbert, an assistant U.S. attorney who helped
prosecute Mr. Mulheren, said late yesterday: "We have not yet
made a determination on the extent of any retrial."
   The jury found earlier this week that Mr. Mulheren, 41
years old, conspired with Mr. Boesky to violate securities
laws. The jury also found that Mr. Mulheren had committed
securities fraud by manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. shares in 1985.
   After the jury returned its verdict on the first four
counts, Judge Cedarbaum sent jurors back to deliberate on the
remaining counts. After two more days of deliberation, the
judge dismissed the jurors, declaring the mistrial.
   "I was quite surprised it ended like this," Mr. Mulheren
said yesterday. Mr. Mulheren said he believed that the Gulf &amp;
Western charges were weaker than others against him.
   Mr. Puccio said there was "no basis in law and fact" for
the convictions. Mr. Puccio said he planned to appeal the
convictions based on his theory that the jury had to find
only that Mr. Mulheren acted "voluntarily" in buying Gulf &amp;
Western stock. Mr. Puccio said that the jury should also have
had to decide whether Mr. Mulheren's purchase was intended to
help Mr. Boesky, as the government has charged.
   "John had no idea what Ivan was doing," Mr. Puccio said,
adding: "Gulf &amp; Western was the weakest part of this case."
   Mr. Mulheren's sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 5.

   BILL TO CUT COSTS, DELAYS in civil lawsuits cleared by
Senate panel.
   The bill, approved 12-1 by the Senate Judiciary Committee,
would require each federal trial court to adopt a plan to cut
costs and delays. It also would create 77 new federal
judgeships, which congressional leaders say are needed to
clear huge backlogs in courts around the nation.
   The Judicial Conference, the policymaking arm of the
federal courts, says the provision on reducing delays is an
improper intrusion into the judicial branch of government.
The conference has advocated adding 96 new seats to the
federal bench.
   The bill received mixed reaction from federal judges but
has bipartisan support and is likely to be approved by the
full Senate. Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D.,
Del.) introduced the legislation jointly with the panel's
ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.
   "For middle-class Americans as well as Fortune 500
companies, this legislation represents an important first
step toward reducing the costs and delays that plague the
civil justice system today," Sen. Biden said.
   The House is moving more slowly in considering legislation
to change the civil judiciary system.
   Some Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee
went along with the Biden-Thurmond bill grudgingly, according
to people familiar with the committee. These lawmakers have
privately expressed surprise and anger that Mr. Biden would
lead an effort to expand the federal judiciary during a
Republican administration. The president nominates federal
judges, who must be confirmed by the Senate.
   For this reason, House Democrats are expected to push for
creating fewer new judgeships than are proposed by the Senate
bill.

   SOUTH KOREAN UNION SUES U.S. company in labor dispute.
   In a move to enforce a labor contract overseas, the South
Korean union filed suit in federal court alleging contract
violations by a U.S. company's Korean subsidiary.
   The union's contract dispute with Pico Products Inc., a
Liverpool, N.Y., maker of telecommunication parts, sparked
labor unrest and a rise in anti-Americanism in South Korea
last year after Pico abruptly closed its plant outside Seoul.
The laborers -- who weren't paid for the preceding month's
work and weren't notified of the closing -- seized the
facility and accused the company of breaking its contract.
   In the suit filed in federal court in Syracuse, N.Y., the
Korean labor union alleged that Pico illegally closed the
plant rather than comply with the contract. The union,
represented by lawyers from the Center for Constitutional
Rights in New York, is seeking punitive damages, back pay and
other compensation, totaling $1 million, allegedly owed to
the workers.
   The suit claims that the contract obligated the company to
make compensation payments and to notify workers of the
closing. And in a move that could affect other multinational
companies if approved by the courts, the suit asks that the
1988 federal plant-closing notification law be applied to
U.S. companies' factories abroad as well as in the U.S.
   Bernard Hitchcock, Pico's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the contract isn't binding on the parent
company. Although the contract was signed by the South Korean
subsidiary in November 1988, he said the parent company never
approved it.
   "Pico Korea {the subsidiary} technically owes them some
wages," he said, but the parent company isn't obligated to
pay.
   Mr. Hitchcock also accused the union of kidnapping the
Korean plant's managers and holding them hostage until they
signed the contract. "I doubt that a contract that's gained
by extortion will be found to be binding," said Mr.
Hitchcock, who as of yesterday said he hadn't seen the suit.

   EDWIN MEESE AWARDED $460,509 for legal bills.
   A federal court in Washington awarded the former attorney
general the money for legal bills incurred during the time he
was investigated by a special prosecutor. The U.S. Court of
Appeals disallowed $115,089 in expenses claimed by Mr.
Meese's defense lawyers, however.
   From May 1987 through June 1988, a special prosecutor
investigated allegations that Mr. Meese violated federal
ethics laws by helping Wedtech Corp. of New York obtain a
defense contract.
   The investigation didn't result in criminal charges being
filed against Mr. Meese. A close adviser to former President
Reagan, Mr. Meese left his post soon after the investigation
concluded.
   Under the independent counsel law, subjects of
investigations who aren't indicted are entitled to be
reimbursed by the government for what the court determines
are their reasonable legal-defense fees.

   TOYOTA IS ACCUSED of blocking a U.S. distributor from
access to Capitol Hill.
   Rep. C. Thomas McMillen (D., Md.) filed an affidavit this
week in federal court complaining that Toyota Motor Sales
wouldn't permit its mid-Atlantic distributor to talk with him
about a legal dispute.
   Mid-Atlantic Toyota, based in Glen Burnie, Md., is an
independent U.S. auto dealer licensed to sell Toyotas in a
five-state region.
   The affidavit is part of a suit that Mid-Atlantic Toyota
filed last month in Los Angeles alleging racketeering and
fraud by Toyota Motor Sales. In his affidavit, Rep. McMillen
says he learned of the dispute through news accounts, but was
unable to get further information because Mid-Atlantic Toyota
said it was gagged by a 1987 agreement with Toyota Motor
Sales. Inability to discuss such matters with constituents
"has a negative impact upon my ability to function as a
congressman," Rep. McMillen contends.
   The suit grew out of a dispute between the two companies
that dates back to 1986, when Toyota Motor Sales sought to
cancel its agreement with the distributor. In response,
Mid-Atlantic Toyota lobbied for Congress to require Japanese
auto manufacturers to distribute their cars exclusively
through independent U.S. dealers.
   The two companies resolved their differences, but as part
of the settlement Mid-Atlantic Toyota was forbidden from
making further contact with Congress on the matter. Now the
U.S. company is seeking to be released from this agreement on
the ground that it violates its First Amendment rights.
   "Their signature is on that agreement," said James Olson,
a spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales, adding: `We aren't trying
to inhibit anybody."
