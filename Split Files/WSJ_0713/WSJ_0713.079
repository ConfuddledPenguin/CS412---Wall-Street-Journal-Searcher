   GTE Corp. and Contel Corp. agreed in principle to merge in
a transaction valued at about $6.2 billion that would create
the largest local-exchange telephone company in the U.S.
   The proposed exchange of stock also would consolidate two
large cellular-phone businesses, expand
telecommunications-satellite opportunities and eventually
could yield more efficient services to local customers.

   The memorandum of understanding approved by the boards of
both companies calls for GTE to issue 1.27 common shares for
each of Contel's 160 million common shares outstanding, or a
total of about 200 million GTE shares. The exchange would be
tax-free to shareholders.
   In response to the announcement, Contel's stock soared in
active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at
$35.125, up $7.125. The news initially sent GTE stock
tumbling $3.375 to $27.625 a share, but it recovered steadily
throughout the day, closing down $1.25 at $29.75. The merger
is likely to lead to dilution in GTE shares next year, and
some analysts figure it could be about 10%. The news also
sparked trading interest in several other telephone-company
stocks.
   Spokesmen for both companies said a definitive agreement
is expected to be drawn up and approved by their boards
within a few weeks. The merger could be completed by year
end, they indicated. In the meantime, the companies must
obtain permission from stockholders and state and federal
regulators, as well as antitrust clearance from the Justice
Department. The companies said they anticipate no problems in
winning the various approvals.
   Analysts said the proposed merger is likely to kick off a
major round of consolidation within the local-exchange
telephone industry. "Telephone access lines are vastly
undervalued by investors," said Jack Grubman, a PaineWebber
analyst. "Clearly, this merger is a groundbreaking event as
the first combination of major telephone companies."
   The combined company, which would operate as GTE Corp.,
would have a total of 17.7 million access lines, more than
any of the seven giant regional Bell companies. And its
cellular-phone operations would serve about 50 million
potential subscribers.
   James L. "Rocky" Johnson, GTE's chairman, would be
chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company.
Charles R. Lee, GTE's president and chief operating officer,
would retain those titles after the merger, the companies
said in a joint announcement.
   Contel's chairman, Charles Wohlstetter, and its vice
chairman, John L. Segall, would become vice chairmen of the
combined company. Donald W. Weber, Contel president and chief
executive, "will occupy a key position in the merged entity,"
according to the statement.
   GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., with operations in 46
states and 41 nations, posted 1989 earnings of $1.4 billion,
or $4.16 a share, on revenue of $17.4 billion. Atlanta-based
Contel, which has telephone operations in 30 states and
cellular operations in 36 metropolitan areas, had earnings of
$287 million, or $1.80 a share, on revenue of $3.1 billion
last year. It operates its cellular systems through a
90%-owned unit, Contel Cellular Inc.
   GTE's Mr. Johnson said in a statement that the combination
"will both position the company strategically and enable us
to exploit more fully the many opportunities for growth that
exist in the world-wide telecommunications marketplace." He
noted that the companies' businesses and organizational
structures complement each other.
   Contel's Mr. Wohlstetter said the merger "will provide the
critical mass and financial strength Contel has sought in
order to accelerate the many initiatives we have taken
recently" in telecommunications. Earlier this year, the
company bought metropolitan cellular properties in the South
from McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
   For consumers, the combination could eventually lead to
more sophisticated telephone services, such as computerized
information services. But for both companies, the merger is
certain to create some short-term havoc. Frank Governali, an
analyst for First Boston, who changed his recommendation on
GTE to "sell," said that meshing the companies is likely to
be a long, costly project.
   "GTE just announced a major restructuring of its own
telephone operations and expects it to take four years," he
said. "Absorbing Contel will be as long and as expensive." In
the end, he said, the merger "makes them a bigger company,
but I don't think it gives them a better strategic position."
   Others noted some regulatory risks for Contel. In states
where both companies operate, Contel's business is generally
small. "They're invisible to regulators and can earn a high
rate of return," said Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. "As
part of GTE, they will be subject to greater regulatory
scrutiny."
   One reason the companies chose to announce the memorandum
of understanding before reaching a definitive agreement,
traders said, may have been to test Wall Street's reaction.
If GTE investors disliked the idea, for example, the
companies could still modify terms of the proposal or scrap
it.
   A benefit for Contel holders could be a higher dividend.
GTE's current payout is $1.46 a share annually, compared with
Contel's $1.10. The GTE spokesman said the merger plan would
have no effect on the board's dividend decision, noting that
GTE has increased its dividend in 34 of the past 35 years.
   Contel has been in the middle of a $400 million equity
offering to help finance its $1.3 billion purchase of
cellular operations from McCaw. That offering would now be
scrapped. GTE had a stock-market capitalization of nearly $20
billion before this agreement, and the new company's
capitalization would be roughly $26 billion.
   Word of the proposed merger pushed up stocks of other
independent local exchange carriers, including Southern New
England Telephone Co., Centel Corp., and even McCaw, which
last year agreed to buy Lin Broadcasting Corp. in a bold
expansion.
   Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it is reviewing
the securities of GTE for possible downgrade and those of
Contel for a possible boost. The move affects $11.2 billion
of debt at GTE and its subsidiaries and $3.7 billion at
Contel and its units.
   The senior debt ratings for the parent companies currently
are single-A-minus at GTE and triple-B at Contel.
