   MANCHESTER, Conn. -- Lydall Inc., citing a general
slowdown in the economy, said its second-quarter net income
was flat to slightly higher on a sales decline of about 8%
from the year-ago period.
   The maker of fiber-based industrial products expects to
report net income of $2.2 million to $2.3 million, or 76 to
79 cents a share, on sales of about $32 million, Leonard
Jaskol, president and chief executive officer, said in an
interview. Analysts were expecting net income of 80 cents a
share, the company said.

   In the year-ago quarter, Lydall earned $2.2 million, or 75
cents a share, on sales of $34.9 million.
   Mr. Jaskol asserted that sales have slowed because of the
phasing out of several product lines and because some markets
aren't as "vibrant" as last year, although he said the
company isn't losing market share.
   Lydall still expects earnings for all of 1990 to grow 11%
to about $3 a share from $7.9 million, or $2.70 a share, in
1989. Sales will be about the same as last year's $128.4
million.
   Mr. Jaskol noted that in the past year, Lydall has phased
out three product lines in its Manning non-wovens division.
The products, inherited when Lydall acquired Manning Paper
Co. in 1986, didn't fit with Lydall's technology and were
draining too many resources, the company said. Mr. Jaskol
said the phase-outs cost the company about $2 million in
sales for the second quarter.
   Lydall's strongest business segments are air and liquid
filtration media -- used in applications such as genetic
engineering and medical laboratories -- and thermal barriers
-- used in the automotive and refrigeration industries, among
others.
   Lydall's filtration media business, which grew 38% last
year, is growing at a slower pace this year, in part because
of a slowdown in sales in South Korea after a record year
last year.
   Mr. Jaskol said Lydall's blood filter media, which filters
out contaminants in blood, is becoming increasingly popular
with hospitals as concern about AIDS and other blood-related
diseases becomes more acute. Lydall recently agreed in
principle to become sole supplier of filtering media for
oxygenators and cardiotomy filters to a unit of medical
supplier Baxter Travenol Inc. for at least two years.
   Lydall is developing a number of other medical filter
media, including a blood filter that will filter out white
blood cells from blood.
   Lydall's thermal barriers -- which are used in numerous
industries as shields from intense heat or cold -- are also
selling at a slower pace this year because of a slowdown in
the auto industry, the company said. The segment grew 52% in
1988 and 25% last year. Mr. Jaskol said he sees continued
growth this year and in 1991, but to a lesser degree.
   The company said it has an agreement with Ford Motor Co.
to help solve heat management problems in Ford's products.
Mr. Jaskol said Lydall may soon get approval to place a new
exterior shield product on some of Ford's noncommercial vans
and trucks -- a "significant" move that would boost revenue
and possibly persuade other U.S. auto makers to buy the
shield as well.
   Lydall said it expects to receive a $500,000 grant from
the New York State Energy Commission to help develop a
product that provides insulation in refrigerators considered
superior to the commonly used chlorofluorocarbon foam. This
foam is considered environmentally damaging and may soon be
banned, said Mr. Jaskol.
   If the foam is banned, Lydall's thermal barrier could be
in widespread use within two years, said Mr. Jaskol. Lydall's
product, however, will cost more than the currently used
foam, Mr. Jaskol added.
   Lydall said it is interested in acquiring related
companies, particularly in Europe, where Lydall sees growth
potential. Lydall has begun talking to several companies
already but hasn't made a decision.
