   The tent in which the Great South Bay Jazz Festival had
been held was nearly empty. The only musician left was tenor
saxophonist and arranger Al Cohn. Walking toward the exit, we
were talking about the players -- Coleman Hawkins, Rex
Stewart, J.C. Higginbotham. All had been, to use Hawkins's
phrase, "full of the spirit." I had been listening to them
since I was 12 years old, and I knew I'd always be listening
to them.
   "Sure," Cohn said, "We're most comfortable with the music
we've grown up on. You try to get with the new sounds, but
when you're by yourself, you play Billie Holiday and Lester
Young and Count Basie."

   That conversation took place a little more than 30 years
ago. Even then, I realized -- though I was much taken with
the startling new sounds of John Coltrane and Cecil Taylor --
that it was Duke Ellington I played late at night when I was
no longer working as a critic.
   Writing about the music had been the only way I could
become part of it. I had been a classical clarinetist since
childhood, but I couldn't improvise worth a damn. My fantasy
had been to be hired by Duke Ellington and, bowing, to take a
seat alongside Johnny Hodges. But I finally acknowledged that
I'd have to go into another line of work, off the bandstand.
   I had another fantasy -- that one of my children might
become so striking a jazz musician as to be hired by
Ellington or Basie. Now I have four children. One is a circus
performer and the other two are in law. But Miranda is a
musician -- a pianist, singer and composer . . .
   In the early stages of her obsession with music, she may
well have listened to every recording that jazz pianist Bill
Evans had ever made, along with an abundance of Billie
Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Duke Ellington. And she was "full
of the spirit" when she played gigs.
   At first, those engagements were in Chinese restaurants,
where a number of jazz musicians, through the decades, have
served apprenticeships. Then there were dates at jazz clubs
where the food wasn't as good, but the audience sometimes
actually listened.
   Meanwhile, she got a master's degree in education at the
Manhattan School of Music, to make sure she'd be able to pay
the rent. She then taught for four years at the Harlem School
of the Arts, and continues to be a "teacher artist" at
Lincoln Center as well as at a number of public schools,
including magnet schools, in and out of New York.
   But, always, her eye was on the performance prize. Hearing
her in clubs, I started thinking that rather than work in
Basie's band, she ought to go on the road with her own combo.
She already was talking like a jazz musician. Reading some of
my reviews of various players, she'd shake her head and say:
"How can you criticize somebody else's performance when you
can't play yourself?" That reminded me of Horace Silver, the
gentlest of jazz pianists off the stand, saying to me years
ago when I worked for Down Beat magazine, "You wrote that I
play `angular' piano. What the hell is that? Can you show me
how to play `angular' piano?"
   Going to some of her gigs, I began to hear that jazz was
less and less on her mind. And she was singing more. It is
her most immediately identifiable sound, dark and resonant.
All the songs were her own, and most were about largely
unrequited love. Her other songs were just plain funny and
self-deprecating.
   Okay, I thought, even though there's not much cabaret
anymore, she can, over time, build up a small but steady
following of listeners who can't stand what's on the radio.
The kind of urbane audience that used to stay for both sets
of Mabel Mercer, and has had hardly anywhere else to go
since.
   But then there was another change. She plunged into rock.
I could no longer hear the lyrics, but I sure could hear the
synthesizers. I told her she had gone into territory far
beyond my ken.
   It wasn't my fault, she told me. It's the way people of my
generation hear music. She and people of her generation
listen in a fundamentally different way so far as textures,
rhythms, the inner meanings of words, and especially feelings
are concerned. Different generations, Dad, look for different
kinds of emotions in music.
   I was too old, in sum, to know when a synthesizer was
singing to me. I tried Ellington's apothegm: "There are only
two kinds of music -- good and bad."
   "To whom?" she said.
   Well, I figured, she's changed before, maybe she'll change
again. On two nights in recent months, I heard her in
Greenwich Village clubs with her new combo, the Miranda
Hentoff Band. I liked seeing that in print, but I wondered if
they swung at all.
   It's not jazz, but these players are musicians, a
description that can be applied to many rock players only
with highly irresponsible kindness. On keyboards, guitar,
bass and drums, the proudly disciplined members of Miranda's
band, who do a lot of studio work on their own, play with
crisp, often exhilarating drive.
   The singer, who also plays acoustic and electric piano
with elan (and no angularity), still features her own songs.
But now I can hear the lyrics again ("I used to think that
time is all you need/Finally I see how many ways you leave").
   As the music spiraled on, I was tapping my foot, like
people of my generation do. This would be a good band to take
on the road, I was thinking. It doesn't have to be jazz to
make people feel good. What they need is a recording date.
   Now there's a refrain that bridges musical generations,
with plenty of feeling.
