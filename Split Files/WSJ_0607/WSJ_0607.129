   Hewlett-Packard Co. said it agreed to supply Mentor
Graphics Corp. with computer equipment valued at up to $400
million.
   The three-year contract, under which Mentor will buy
workstations, software and service, replaces an 18-month,
$100 million contract that expired this month. Under the new
contract, Mentor will also buy new workstations that
Hewlett-Packard is developing, including machines that use as
their central controller Motorola Inc.'s new 68040
microprocessor. Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif.,
plans to unveil its 68040 machines on June 18.
