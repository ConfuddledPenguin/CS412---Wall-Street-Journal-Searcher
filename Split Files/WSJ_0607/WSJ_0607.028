   Midlantic Corp., a bank-holding company, said the sale
will help restructure its balance sheet. The company has been
hurt by the deteriorating New Jersey real-estate market.
   Midlantic said it will enter into an agreement to continue
providing customers with credit cards under the Midlantic
name.
