   With Congress and the Bush White House sitting down again
this week to resume their seance over taxes and the federal
budget, there has been a fair amount of expectant
palpitations in Washington over California's Proposition 111.
The purpose of the initiative was to double the state's
current nine-cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline to build new
roads as well as tie the state's Gann spending limit to
income growth in the state rather than to inflation. The hope
was that passage of Prop. 111 would liberate politicians
elsewhere from the gravitational pull of anti-tax sentiment.
The theory runs like this:
   In 1978, Californians passed Proposition 13, the anti-tax
and anti-spending initiative that crested atop a wave of
voter fury over ever-rising property taxes, which of course
the politicians were pouring into ever-expanding public
commitments. California's former Governor, Ronald Reagan,
rode this sentiment into the White House, and used it to cut
federal taxes, which choked off Congress's ability to create
new, open-ended entitlements, such as subsidized health-care
schemes. George Bush then soared into the White House atop a
no-new-taxes pledge, which many Republicans in Congress now
regard as the one issue that distinguished them from the
Democratic Party, forever sentenced to the purgatory of its
tax-and-spend legacy.

   But before the folks who think Prop. 111's passage means
they can start entreating America to return to the glory days
that pre-dated the Reagan presidency, a few words of caution.
   Though they had opposite goals, the California proposition
that made the tax revolt a household word and the one Tuesday
that will raise taxes for roads have something crucial in
common: With these initiatives, Californians have essentially
taken the authority to tax away from the politicians,
preferring to do it themselves for discrete, identifiable
purposes. This is a far cry from now saying that people are
willing to send another $25 billion in new taxes into the
dark and bottomless maw of Congress. It's our sense that
voters by now have lost most of their faith in the modern
political system's ability to discipline its spending.
(Another California initiative to force money-related ethical
reforms on the state's legislators passed 63% to 37%.)
   And despite Prop. 111's adoption by a vote of 53% to 47%,
the initial exit polling is revealing. Urban voters favored
the tax increase, rural voters opposed it and suburbanites
split 50-50. Those voters identified as "rich" backed the
doubling of the gasoline tax 60% to 40%, while those
identified as "poor" opposed it by about the same margin. In
the same poll, conservatives were found to be strongly
opposed, while liberals strongly favored the measure. Thus we
have the poor and conservatives united on an economic issue,
with liberals and the rich on the other side. Perhaps Prop.
111 really is a straw in the wind.
   The political instinct to tax is so strong today that we
shouldn't have to wait long for a test of Prop. 111's
significance. The people in California who earn their incomes
from the public sector have been about driven crazy by the
state's anti-tax years, and the first signs may emerge today
when Governor Deukmejian and legislative leaders meet for
their own budget summit.
   There is some feeling that the Democrats would dearly like
to add a bracket or two on top of an already progressive
income-tax schedule. But at a press conference yesterday,
Governor Deukmejian was in a feisty "no more new taxes" mood,
baiting the Democrats to saddle their gubernatorial candidate
Dianne Feinstein with an income-tax boost.
   So we'd say the meaning of California's Prop. 111 comes
down to this: Democrats and various Beltway economists are
sitting there wondering if they can get a hand on the tax gun
again, while the opposition is whispering the words of a
famous President: Go ahead, make my day.
