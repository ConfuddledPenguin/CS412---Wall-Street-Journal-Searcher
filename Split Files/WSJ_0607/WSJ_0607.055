   NEW YORK -- Hitachi Ltd. of Japan introduced a line of
mainframe computers, the first of the new generation of
IBM-compatible machines that will come out in the next few
quarters.
   The machines, as previously reported, easily outdistance
those on the market from International Business Machines
Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Amdahl Corp., which is 46%-owned by
Fujitsu and sells machines that Fujitsu designs. Consultants
said that the Hitachi machine with three central processors
can operate at 124 million instructions per second, and that
the four-processor machine runs at 150 mips. By contrast,
IBM's most powerful machine runs at 112 mips, and the fastest
Fujitsu/Amdahl mainframe runs at 108 mips.

   The machines coming from IBM and Fujitsu/Amdahl are
expected to be roughly comparable to the Hitachi hardware.
Still, Hitachi, which has been the laggard at the high end of
the mainframe market, is finally expected to become a player
there.
   Hitachi said shipments will begin in the third quarter.
Its 80%-owned U.S. arm, Hitachi Data Systems, said it will
begin shipments in the 1991 second quarter. That, again, puts
it roughly on a par with IBM and Fujitsu/Amdahl, which are
expected to begin U.S. shipments between the 1991 second
quarter and the end of the year.
   Hitachi Data said a typical three-processor system will be
priced at $11.8 million, and a typical four-processor system
at $14.4 million. Consultants said these prices are about 10%
to 15% less than IBM charges for each unit of computing
power, the normal discount needed to compete with IBM.
