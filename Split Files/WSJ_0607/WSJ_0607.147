   DALLAS -- Huddled around a rack of silk ties at the
NorthPark Mall here, Deanna Woolley and Janet Weidenbach
express the divided loyalties of the J.C. Penney shopper.
   Ms. Weidenbach buys her hosiery at Penney. Last Christmas,
Ms. Woolley bought a sweater for her mother here, and she
often buys shirts and ties for her father at the store. Both
women admire the tonier merchandise and the snazzy
chrome-and-glass fixtures that have come with Penney's
attempt to upgrade its image. "I didn't used to like to come
to J.C. Penney at all," Ms. Woolley confesses as she selects
a $16 yellow tie for her father. "It was old-looking, kind of
like going to Sears."

   Score one for the new Penney's. But ask the 21-year-olds
where they buy their own clothes and almost in unison they
answer, "The Limited" -- the trendy specialty retailer. For
Penney, a formerly frumpy mass merchant and the nation's
fourth-largest retailer -- with $16.4 billion in 1989 sales
-- the combination of praise and snub is all too common.
   While other big retailers tangled with corporate raiders
during the 1980s -- often with disastrous results -- Penney
was undergoing face lifts and tummy tucks in an effort to
remake itself into a department-store beauty queen. In some
ways the effort has worked, and earnings have rebounded
sharply.
   But Penney still lags behind many of its rivals in sales
per square foot of floor space. It has yet to persuade many
makers of chic women's wear to supply it with the clothing
and accessories it needs to help shake its reputation as a
low-price purveyor of linens, children's clothing and hard
goods. "Over the past decade, no major retailer in America
has changed as much as J.C. Penney," company Chairman William
R. Howell told investors in March. But, he added later, "you
don't change 90 years of consumer perceptions in less than a
decade."
   Penney's experience is a sobering lesson for other
old-line retailers, such as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and
Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. They also need to change the way
shoppers and suppliers view them to survive in a crowded
industry. In its mass-merchandising heyday, Penney joined
Sears and Ward in selling cookie-cutter basics to
middle-income Americans whose choices were determined by
price and reliability. But discounters stole away many of the
price-conscious, while regional malls gave the
quality-conscious more -- and more fashionable --
alternatives.
   Penney recognized the shift in the mid-1970s, when Mr.
Howell, then director of domestic development, headed a task
force charged with putting Penney's stores back in touch with
middle America. Armed with "a blank sheet of paper and four
offices," the task force interviewed dozens of consultants
and hundreds of employees and customers, and scouted more
than 70 competitors. The conclusion: The company was trying
to do too many things in the wrong places.
   While it had grown up as the all-purpose store in small
towns, Penney had spent the 1950s and 1960s snapping up
choice locations in the new regional shopping malls. But the
shoppers flocking to those malls went to buy clothes and
accessories, not car batteries, refrigerators or lawn mowers.
They also wanted brand names, which Penney had booted out
years before in favor of higher-margin private labels.
Penney, it was decided, needed to become a fashionable
national department store for middle-income and
upper-middle-income customers.
   The transition has hardly been painless. Penney closed
down its appliance, lawn and garden, paint, hardware and
automotive lines in 1983 and its home electronics and
sporting goods lines in 1988, surrendering more than $1.5
billion in annual sales. The company says it also cut $60
million from its annual budget and reinvigorated its
management ranks by moving its headquarters to Dallas from
New York two years ago. The move cost some 1,250 New Yorkers
their jobs.
   The company has slowly changed. Tile floors in stores have
given way to parquet and carpet. Penney has installed a
state-of-the art video satellite network to display new
merchandise to its buyers and also to potential customers.
The system permits Penney to test-market new styles and has
made store buying and inventory control more efficient. In
expanded men's and women's fashion departments, $7.99
polyester ties and $29.99 women's shifts have given way to
$22 silk neckwear and $80 career dresses.
   The result: From a garden-variety mass merchant, Penney
has blossomed into something glossier.
   Over the past five years, while the number of Penney
stores shrank by 10%, annual revenue has grown 16% and net
income has more than doubled to $802 million. Though its
stock price languishes at 10 times earnings, compared with 20
times earnings for hot retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, The
Limited and The Gap, Wall Street is generally upbeat about
Penney's future. "I would sign a blood oath that says Penney
is improving its business and will have up earnings for three
years," says Oppenheimer analyst Bruce Missett. "I wouldn't
do that for K mart, even in pencil."
   For all its efforts, however, Penney's yearly sales per
square foot, a measure of retailing productivity, are a
disappointing $128 at metropolitan stores, and even less if
other stores are included. By contrast, Dayton's and Hudson's
department stores and Mervyn's both sell about $202 of
merchandise a square foot; May department stores do $159.
   To get to a more respectable $150 to $175 a square foot,
securities analysts say, Penney buyers must continue to
improve the merchandise mix and exploit fashion trends. Some
analysts also suggest that Penney needs to close more stores,
though it has shut 270 smaller ones, mostly outside malls, in
the past five years.
   Penney hasn't discovered the marketing elixir that would
win over women who now buy towels, men's shirts and
children's clothes at Penney and then scurry off to The
Limited or a rival department store to shop for themselves.
Part of the problem remains the lack of coveted brand names.
The biggest brand in Penney's most fashionable women's area
is its own house label, Jacqueline Ferrar; the biggest name
at the cosmetics counter is little-known French maker Fernand
Aubry. "It's difficult to categorize yourself as a department
store when you don't have Clinique makeup," says Margo
McGlade of PaineWebber.
   Though Penney has more than 1,300 stores and an unusual
reputation for paying bills on time, its executives still
must travel the country begging big-name suppliers to treat
them like May and Dayton Hudson, not Sears and Montgomery
Ward. That has been a tough sell, mainly because many apparel
and cosmetics makers fear that the chain will discount their
goods or otherwise cheapen their images.
   Mr. Howell recalls his first approach to Levi Strauss &amp;
Co. in 1979 about selling its jeans through Penney. Saying
"I'm here to plead with you," he promised that Penney stores
were going to "change dramatically in the 1980s." Mr. Howell
says the room went "very quiet, and that was about the end of
the meeting."
   Levi, aware that it might be missing a huge group of
customers, finally agreed to sell to Penney -- three years
later. Penney now claims to be Levi's largest customer,
selling about $100 million a year of the Dockers brand alone.
But the move cost Levi some business. R.H. Macy &amp; Co. stores
dropped Levi's jeans, reasoning that the brand had lost its
exclusiveness by appearing at a mass marketer, and still
doesn't sell the line today.
   Other manufacturers have been even harder to persuade. Top
women's brands such as Elizabeth Arden, Estee Lauder, Liz
Claiborne and Evan-Picone still shun Penney. Officials of
those companies won't say why. Bernard Chaus, chairman of an
upper-moderate women's apparel maker bearing his name,
applauds Penney's improving image, but says that the prices
of his clothing still are too high for Penney stores.
"Perhaps someday we'll do business with them," he says.
   Penney officials say that cosmetics and women's apparel
makers seem concerned that other customers might suddenly
consider them declasse. The attitude frustrates and puzzles
those at Penney who have worked to upgrade its merchandise.
While a few men's suits still sell for $149.99, most cost
$175 to $350. Bridal departments at many stores have been
converted to career boutiques selling women's suits at prices
between $250 and $340. A hot-selling $12 leather purse was
dropped because its look clashed with more expensive
pocketbooks.
   The company's efforts, combined with competitors'
travails, have yielded some gains. After years of lobbying
with manufacturers, the company this year is adding Haggar
and Van Heusen brands to its men's department, Oshkosh B'Gosh
to children's and Maidenform and Warner's to lingerie lines.
Some manufacturers concede their decision to sell to Penney
was accelerated by the bankruptcy filing of Campeau Corp.
chains and by other financial problems in the retailing
business.
   Even some of those who have committed to a Penney
connection remain skittish about the relationship, however. A
designer whose line will move into Penney stores this summer
calls the company "a force in the 1990s." Then he asks not to
be cited by name for fear of being too closely identified
with Penney. "That wouldn't be good for our name or our
business," he says, evoking the memory of the late designer
Halston. Designers say he lost some cachet after marketing
clothing exclusively through Penney in the mid-1980s. Penney
says the relationship improved its image, and blames
financial and ownership problems for Halston's fate.
   For years, Maidenform Inc. has made Penney's private-label
lingerie. Beginning in July, it will sell its own brand at
Penney, too. But this took Penney six years of wooing. "The
argument that won the day until recently was that we had a
brand to protect," says Robert A. Brawer, Maidenform
president. "We asked ourselves, are we prepared to suffer the
consequences, to lose a couple of million dollars in
department store business?"
   There were several heated Maidenform management meetings.
Then, Mr. Brawer says, a visit from top Penney executives,
and the remodeling of Penney stores to better highlight
name-brand merchandise, finally convinced Maidenform that
Penney would display its products well. Other department
stores haven't reacted strongly to the decision, he says, and
"I don't think we're going to get hurt."
   As the courting of manufacturers continues, so do the
physical makeovers of stores. Large-size and petite women's
departments have grown. Penney is replacing novelty goods of
the airport-gift-shop type with $35 picture frames, desk sets
and $280-and-up glass collectibles.
   Last year, it tried to improve its cosmetics lines by
dumping so-called drugstore lines like Max Factor, L'Oreal
and English Leather that had accounted for $21 million a year
in sales. Still, the cosmetics department remains a sore
spot, producing only about 2 1/2% of a Penney store's sales,
compared with the 10% or so that cosmetics produce for
competitors.
   So Penney has added to its cosmetics training staff and
increased its sales promotion with direct mail and scented
fliers in its charge-card bills. At new and remodeled stores,
Penny is moving the cosmetics counter to the main mall
entrance. At the NorthPark store in Dallas, the move has
lifted the sales 36% this year.
   Penney women's departments of the past seemed "a sea of
racks that didn't have a clear definition," says Marshall
Beere, divisional vice president for women's sportswear. Two
years ago, displays were rearranged to separate goods that
appeal to the more fashion-conscious from those aimed at
shoppers more concerned with quality or price. Buyers' jobs
were redefined; instead of buying all women's tops or junior
bottoms, for instance, a buyer now picks products only for
customers in a specific target group. Women's sales are up,
and the junior department recorded sales gains last year in
the high-teens category.
   Yet women shoppers, who buy more window coverings and
towels at Penney than from any other retailer in the U.S.,
remain reluctant to buy their dressy clothes there. Laquilla
Cheek, a Dallas homemaker shopping for graduation gifts, says
she hasn't looked at Penney's women's clothes in 10 years.
"My mother wore plaid Penney shirtwaist dresses for years,"
she says, and she still envisions Penney's clothes as
designed for "dowdy old women." She does buy children's and
men's clothes at Penney.
   Susan Seiter, a corporate investor-relations specialist,
says she buys lingerie and linens at Penney. She recently
stocked up on pantyhose at a Hurst, Texas, store, but then
spent $400 on Jones of New York and other brands on sale at
another department store. "The few times I've looked {at
Penney}, there might be an attractive blouse," she says, "but
it will be polyester and look hot, like it would smell like
New Jersey if you wore it in the summer."
   Penney believes that such women and the manufacturers who
cater to them eventually will see the light. "We'd like to
have Clinique at J.C. Penney" along with other brands, says
Penney Chairman Howell. He believes the years of changes will
eventually produce a breakthrough. "I'm confident that there
will be a day when all of those options will be at our
disposal," he says. "Just as the Berlin Wall came down very
quickly, I'm very optimistic."
