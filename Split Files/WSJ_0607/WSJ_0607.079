   WASHINGTON -- The comptroller of the currency said that
his office has identified areas of the country where
weakening real estate values could hurt banks but that the
problems in those areas aren't as bad as the one in New
England.
   Comptroller Robert Clarke, the top regulator of federally
chartered banks, made the disclosure in testimony before the
House Small Business Committee. He wouldn't identify the
geographical areas.

   Mr. Clarke said the comptroller's office planned to talk
to bankers in the regions and "might do targeted
examinations" of real estate loans to determine how
widespread the problem is. Following targeted examinations in
New England, banks in the area set aside more than $2 billion
for potential losses. The comptroller's office has previously
said it is looking at real estate lending in the mid-Atlantic
and Southeast regions.
   Mr. Clarke said the newly identified problems were "not
comparable" in magnitude to the troubles in New England.
   Testifying before the committee, Mr. Clarke and other
federal banking regulators reiterated their belief that there
isn't a widespread credit crunch induced by tougher bank
examinations, as some business groups have charged.
   While surveys have shown that banks are tightening credit
standards for small and medium-size businesses, the main
cause isn't stricter regulation, said Federal Reserve Gov.
John LaWare. "Those banks that indicated they were taking
steps to tighten credit most often cited as reasons their
concerns about the general economy or the prospects for
particular industries," he said.
   Mr. LaWare also cited a recent survey by the National
Federation of Independent Businesses which found "less
borrowing by small firms, but supported the view that during
the first quarter these firms had no unusual difficulty"
obtaining credit.
   Statistics show a moderate drop-off in lending in New
England, particularly for real estate construction, but
that's a healthy reaction to the overbuilt markets, the
regulators said. Mr. Clarke noted that office vacancy rates
in Boston increased to 14.6% in 1989 from 7% in 1983.
   Though most committee members didn't criticize the
regulators, Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.) said he had heard
from small-business people, contractors and banks. "A curtain
has been dropped on some of the entrepreneurship we've seen
in New England over the last decade," he said.
   The regulators did agree that at least some banks have
reacted to the tough regulation of the New England banks by
reining in lending to credit-worthy borrowers. Paul Fritts,
head of bank supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said, "A banker looks around and sees 700 or 800 bank
failures in the last few years and says, `I don't want that
to happen to me.'"
   It "appears that some bankers have reduced their lending
to credit-worthy customers," Mr. Clarke said. "We are taking
steps to encourage the bankers not to overreact."
