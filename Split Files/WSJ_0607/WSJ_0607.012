   Life-insurance companies are requiring blood samples from
more and more applicants mostly because of the AIDS epidemic.
But the practice has had other effects besides helping
insurers turn away people exposed to the deadly virus.
   The ability to analyze blood for cholesterol levels and
other indicators is one factor that has prompted many
companies to offer lower rates to people judged "preferred"
risks.

   At the same time, the blood analyses are also leading some
insurers to "rate" -- that is, demand higher premiums from --
a small number of people who wouldn't previously have been
identified as "substandard" risks.
   Around 6% to 8% of applicants are being rated at Lincoln
National Life Insurance Co., up from 5% to 7% before blood
testing was so extensive, says Donald Chambers, chief medical
director at the Fort Wayne, Ind., company. He says the added
ratings mostly reflect findings of impaired liver function,
high cholesterol and previously undetected diabetes.
   Insurers are also postponing action on some applications
until the individuals' doctors can sort out what the abnormal
test readings mean. "We are not going to write the insurance
until the situation is resolved, or at least defined," says
John Snore, vice president for underwriting and claims at
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N.J.
   Most insurers are requiring blood samples from people who
seek life-insurance coverage of $100,000 or more. But some
companies have gone down to $50,000, at least in
jurisdictions where the risk of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome looms largest. For instance, Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Co., Springfield, this month dropped to a
$50,000 threshold in California, while holding at $100,000
elsewhere.
   Insurers have also expanded their scrutiny of urine
specimens over the past few years to include tests for
cocaine use. A "surprisingly high" 1% of people tested by
Prudential are showing up as cocaine users and thus are being
turned down for insurance, Mr. Snore says.
