   NEW YORK -- Michael Belkin, a Salomon Brothers analyst,
looks at the historical record of the stock market and finds
it disconcerting.
   Only twice in this century has the Dow Jones Industrial
Average risen in five consecutive years. The first was in the
Roaring Twenties, 1924-1928; the other was the past five
years, 1985-1989.

   Comparing the 1920s with the past decade isn't new, but
Mr. Belkin's study adds a twist. "Most people who have
thought about this have wondered whether 1987 -- the year of
the modern stock market crash -- corresponded to 1929," he
says. The market's surge since 1987 has largely dispelled the
fear that a latter-day version of the 1930s Depression lurks
around the corner.
   "But looking at history, a different kind of pattern
emerges," Mr. Belkin says. Specifically, in every single year
since 1976, the stock market has moved the same direction --
rising or falling -- as it did 61 years earlier.
   Coincidence? Perhaps. But Mr. Belkin is in part a
technical analyst, and technical analysts pay a lot of
attention to past market patterns. And he says that 1929 --
the year of the Great Crash -- bears more resemblance to the
current year, 1990, than to 1987. Stock prices also were
rising for a while in 1929, but they ended the year down 17%.
They fell further in 1930 and dropped more sharply still in
1931.
   Mr. Belkin doesn't expect another Depression. His
conclusion may be stated simply: "It's late in the market
cycle and not the time for wild-eyed speculation."
   Fundamental investors may view as wild-eyed any attempt to
predict stock prices on the basis of what happened 61 years
earlier. But Mr. Belkin's study is noteworthy not so much
because markets repeat themselves in lockstep, but because
the behavior of people who participate in markets does tend
to recur.
   The real point of Mr. Belkin's exercise, he says, is that
he "very much believes in economic cycles and in market
cycles." Bull markets don't last forever; at least, the bull
markets in gold, oil, real estate, technology stocks, junk
bonds, Japanese equities and Donald Trump didn't last
forever.
   Why is that relevant? It is relevant because in the latest
leg of the stock market rally, it can be argued that people
have been buying because the market has been rising.
   "People are buying because the market is going up. That's
exactly what's going on," says Joseph McAlinden, head of
research at Dillon Read. "All the sophisticated money
managers will tell you that's true of the small investor but
that they're buying for different reasons. But the truth is,
it's the same. They don't want to miss the rise."
   This is worth pondering. If markets fell in 1929 (and for
three years thereafter) after a five-year bull market in the
'20s, why does the five-year bull market of the late 1980s
guarantee that markets will rise in 1990?
   It doesn't. Yet investors small and large are pouring
money into stocks, largely because they have been watching
the market rise.
   James Solloway, chief economist of Argus Research,
disputes this view. He says there is "something fundamental"
spurring the rise. "It's more than the herd instinct," he
says. "The fact is, we have had a sharp decline in interest
rates and a shift in perceptions" regarding the economy.
   Nonetheless, he concedes that the herd instinct "does help
to build a momentum." And, noting that cash levels of mutual
fund managers have reached a record, he says: "There is a
certain amount of pressure on money managers. Like the
lottery, you gotta be in it to win it."
   In Mr. McAlinden's view, the various reasons offered for
the market's rise are just rationalizations. "They have to
have a rationalization," he says. "Look at the flow of money
into mutual funds. Why are they buying now when they thought
it was a mistake to buy at 2500? They're buying because
they've seen the Dow go to 2900 and they want to get in.
Obviously, the values were better at 2500."
   The rationalizations, he says, obscure a point about the
behavior of people in markets. Generally, he says, people
extrapolate recent experience into the future. If the market
has been going up, people assume it will continue, just as it
did for most of the 1920s.
   "People think they're looking out the front-view mirror,"
Mr. McAlinden says. "Actually, markets drive through the
rear-view mirror."
   Note, for instance, a piece of research from
Robinson-Humphrey dated May 31. "Expect DJIA 3000 by Summer's
End," it says. Among the reasons for the "improvement" in the
"short-term outlook," Robinson-Humphrey states: "Stock market
moving averages rose above their 200-day moving averages
while volume expanded." In other words: the market rose,
therefore it will rise.
   A close cousin of rear-view thinking is the belief by
investors that they will recognize a change in the trend
before others do. Alas, Mr. McAlinden is not immune. His June
1990 report, "Frothy Finale," says:
   "Investors may logically question the wisdom of
participating now. But the forces . . . which could bring the
stock rise to an unpleasant ending are months or more down
the road. . . . For these reasons we continue to adivse a
fully invested posture toward equities, with emphasis on
GNP-sensitive groups" and smaller stocks.
   The premise of rear-view thinking was tested with Charles
Clough, chief strategist at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Clough,
frequently a contrarian (one might call him a front-view
driver), says: "Investors may be doing the wrong thing by
buying the S&amp;P 500. It has outperformed everything this year.
In fact, it's risen 18% a year in the '80s. The investor sees
that and thinks it's normal. It isn't."
   Mr. Clough is recommending smaller and "secondary" stocks
instead. Yet not even he seems unmoved by the Dow's rise.
   "We've got a valuation problem in a hard-nose fundamental
sense," he says. "The market isn't underpriced. But this
year, it's been smarter to follow the sentiment indicators
than the fundamental indicators."
   Does it matter, then, that the S&amp;P 500 is priced at 17
times earnings, which may be a bit on the high side
historically and compares with a recent overall market
multiple of around 16? "The market has been able to ignore
that," Mr. Clough says. "It makes it very hard to suggest
when it's going to stop."
   Is he, then, bearish?
   "The market's telling you not to be," he says.
   Of course, the market said the same thing in 1929.
