   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said that despite recent weak employment numbers,
he doesn't see any underlying deterioration in the U.S.
economy.
   The Fed chairman's comments, made at an international
monetary conference in San Francisco, followed a report in
The Wall Street Journal Tuesday that Fed officials have no
plans to ease short-term interest rates in the near future.

   Mr. Greenspan also said that it is unclear whether the
unification of Germany will lead to higher interest rates
around the globe, "I think it's much too soon, at this stage,
to make any judgments about what the effect on interest rates
will be," he said. Mr. Greenspan said there was little good
information about how the monetary union of East and West
Germany would affect the economy, or overall savings and
investment.
   "Without having a particularly good fix on those critical
points, I don't see how it is realistic to make judgments
about what" interest rates will be, he said.
