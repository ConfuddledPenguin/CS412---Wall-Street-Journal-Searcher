   WASHINGTON -- The White House and Congress resumed
deficit-reduction negotiations amid increased jockeying over
how to proceed with fiscal 1991 appropriations in the absence
of a final budget agreement for the year beginning Oct. 1.
   Spending bills for the Energy, State, Justice and Commerce
departments are slated to come before House Appropriations
subcommittees this afternoon. But the Democratic leadership
backed away from a high-profile fight over a resolution to
first formalize discretionary spending levels for the new
fiscal year.

   House Republicans had opposed any action now on the
resolution, and John Sununu, the White House chief of staff,
weighed into the fray in a private phone conversation with
Speaker Thomas Foley. Mr. Sununu, according to several
sources, raised the prospect of President Bush's going on
television to accuse the Democrats of scuttling the budget
talks. The high-pressure tactics underscore the political
concern on all sides to avoid being blamed if the
negotiations collapse.
   In stepping back, House Democrats gave up none of their
ability to proceed at a later date, but there is concern that
the administration itself is looking for an opportunity to
step away from the talks. "If these guys are this upset about
a procedural issue that was announced," said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), "It raises
concern that they are looking for an excuse to leave the
room."
   Republicans had proposed an alternative measure
emphasizing the need for a speedy completion of the budget
summit this month. And the administration would prefer to
delay any commitment to new domestic spending until an
agreement is reached on a larger deficit package encompassing
the administration's own priorities, such as defense and
foreign aid.
   The proposed spending levels in the Democratic resolution
are equivalent to those in the House-passed budget this
spring. Once the appropriations bills begin to move, Budget
Director Richard Darman will find it hard to reallocate funds
as the president wants. The dispute is less over total
spending than the distribution between defense and domestic
accounts. And for all of the reputed emphasis on deficit
reduction, the Democratic plan anticipates slightly lower
total appropriations than the administration.
   For example, the Democratic resolution allocates more than
$209.1 billion to domestic discretionary accounts, or almost
9% more than the $191.9 billion proposed by the
administration. This increase is more than offset by a $24
billion reduction from the president's military budget, and
the total appropriations provided for all accounts would be
about $5 billion less than what Mr. Darman himself proposed.
   The budget director said later that it was "prudent" for
the Democrats to delay action. But as a practical matter, the
House Appropriations Committee can procede with or without
the resolution under the current budget law. The committee
leadership has set a schedule for itself of completing four
major bills, including the fiscal 1991 foreign-aid budget, by
the July 4 recess. And unless the fragile talks show more
progress, the fight is sure to be joined before the end of
this month.
   Democrats fear that failure to pass 13 separate
appropriation bills will leave the party open to criticism
later this year from the president. The most recent time that
Congress passed one omnibus spending bill, President Reagan
embarrassed Democrats by dumping a copy of the huge bill on
the podium during his State of the Union address and vowing
never to sign another.
   The skirmishing in the House parallels that in the Senate.
The Senate hasn't adopted any budget resolution, and that
threatens to hold up consideration of appropriations bills.
Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee and a member of the appropriations panel, said he
is leaning toward quickly adopting the House-passed
resolution to avoid the need for a House-Senate conference.
The process is being driven foremost by pressure from Senate
Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), the former
majority leader. Sen. Byrd is believed to have a commitment
from Majority Leader George Mitchell to move ahead with the
appropriations bills while the summit continues.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the
budget committee, said he objects to embracing the House
resolution, but he isn't eager to adopt the Senate Budget
Committee alternative, either. "If this (summit) negotiation
is to be meaningful, it ought not to be prejudiced by any
(appropriations) bills," he said.
   The House can proceed with appropriations bills based on
its own budget resolution. Senate rules differ. Without a
resolution that both houses pass, it would take 60 votes in
the Senate to pass any appropriations bill instead of the
usual majority.
   At yesterday's meeting of the budget summit, Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney agreed to work with congressional
defense specialists on a new analysis of the budgetary
consequences of cutting military forces by 25% over the next
five years. The study is to be presented to the summit
negotiators in about a week, he said.
   "Twenty-five percent looks like a reasonable number to
look at given the changed threat," Mr. Cheney said, echoing
earlier statements. "Nobody has made any decisions or signed
off on any numbers," he added. The House-passed budget would
require even deeper cuts in military forces, he said.
   The prime significance of the joint study, according to
Sen. Sasser, is "that it is the only thing we've agreed on in
the past few days." He said that he asked Mr. Cheney to also
prepare analyses of 15% and 35% cuts in forces. Sen. Domenici
termed the study "constructive" because it could eventually
lead to an agreement on a five-year defense budget.
   The summit resumes today with a review of Social Security,
Medicare and farm subsidies. Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.),
author of a bill to cut Social Security payroll taxes, will
participate.
