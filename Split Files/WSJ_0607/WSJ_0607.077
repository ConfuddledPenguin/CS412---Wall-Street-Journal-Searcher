   In the beginning, there was no God. There was the Goddess.
She peered into the great void and created the Heaven and the
Earth, and in this new domain women ruled. The world was
peaceful and both sexes worshipped Her.
   But then, about 3,000 B.C., men decided they had a better
idea. They installed male deities -- among them the sun god
Marduk, who did in Tiamat, the mother of all gods, by pumping
air down her throat and blowing her to bits. Things, sadly,
haven't been the same since.

   Or so say people like Ruth Barrett. Ms. Barrett, who lives
in Los Angeles, is a Goddess worshipper, one of a growing
number of revisionists who believe it's high time to give
credit where credit is due: It was a woman who molded Earth,
argues Ms. Barrett, and it is men -- and their male gods --
who messed it up. "We don't want men to wear dog collars and
be on leashes," she says. "But patriarchy must be put in its
place."
   So it is that Evie-Kaiulani Daufin, a lapsed Catholic, has
found spiritual enlightenment not in church but in the Garden
of the Goddess in Costa Mesa, Calif. On a recent sun-splashed
afternoon, Ms. Daufin, decked out in a grass skirt and bead
necklace in the shape of fallopian tubes and ovaries, joins
five others in the Garden (actually, someone's backyard) for
a fertility rite.
   They giggle as they plunge a 12-foot pole into a hole they
have dug in "Mother Earth." Then Ms. Daufin, a journalism
professor, dances with the other women around the Maypole.
The worshipers include a graying ex-nun who calls herself
Changing Woman. They purify themselves with burnt sage, sing
in a circle, clutch their wombs and beseech the Goddess to
make their lives more fruitful. Their wails reach a feverish
pitch and peak in a primal scream.
   Just another New Age fad? No way, says Judith D. Auerbach,
who studies gender issues at the University of Southern
California's Institute for the Study of Women and Men. "Women
first wanted to apply feminism to political and economic
realms, then to their families," she says. "Now, they want it
in their spiritual lives." Goddess worshipers believe that to
recreate a harmonious world, traits they consider male
(dominance, aggressiveness, competitiveness) must give way to
female "energies" (intuition, nurturing and compassion).
Women should be revered, they say, because they bear
offspring, and are thus linked to nature's cycles.
   "This isn't just God in drag," insists Susan Gitlin-Emmer,
an artist and Goddess worshiper in Reseda, Calif. To her, the
Goddess is earth-bound, represents harmony -- not hierarchy
-- among all living things, and can take on many faces.
Lunaea Weatherstone, who publishes a magazine on pagan
rituals, has fashioned an altar to the Goddess. It bears a
statue of Aphrodite, a crystal penis, purple candles, a
chalice and a shell. It is here, she says, that she worships
the Goddess on solstices, equinoxes and Groundhog Day.
   Goddess worship has been around for a long time, but a
recent spate of academic works on Goddess religions, and
growing debate in traditional faiths about male bias in
theology, has brought in a new wave of believers. Worship
groups -- mostly, but not exclusively, female -- have sprung
up from California to Massachusetts. Now there are Goddess
newsletters, Goddess books, a California Goddess hotline and
a monthly cable-television Goddess show (with host Starr
Goode). Ms. Barrett, a self-described witch, says she gets a
steady stream of students for her year-long course on the
Goddess. One big draw: the introductory lesson in spell
casting.
   In San Francisco and Los Angeles, the Circle of Aradia and
Women Spirit Rising, both worship groups, now stage elaborate
public rituals. During the equinox last fall, 200 women in
Long Beach, some dressed in embroidered robes, others naked,
streamed into a cavernous room lit by candles. One high
priestess, sword in hand, walked in a circle, calling out the
powers of earth, wind, fire and air. "Blessed Be]" the crowd
rejoined.
   Ms. Daufin attended that ceremony. "Women were singing,
wailing, jumping, planting seeds in an urn full of earth,"
she says. As the chanting became frenzied, the priestess
inveighed against rape and child abuse. Exhausted, everyone
fell to the ground.
   Judith Piquet, a Los Angeles actress and masseuse, prefers
a more private "mystery dance" when she prays. She
demonstrates: Standing beside two altars in her bedroom, Ms.
Piquet closes her eyes and sensuously slices the air with her
hands. She begins to breathe heavily. A look of ecstacy comes
over her face and, as her Rubenesque figure quivers, the
dance ends abruptly. "I am trying to dance out the separate
aspects of the Goddess in me," she explains.
   Ms. Piquet says she tried mainstream religions, but felt
they patronized women. "You've got the Father, the Son and
the Holy Ghost. Three men. Not a woman in sight," she says.
Three years ago, she moved into a communal house with four
women who worship the Goddess. "Everything fell into place. I
saw how devalued women had been," says Ms. Piquet. Some of
the women, she says, pray for the time when science will make
men unnecessary for procreation.
   Which isn't to say that all Goddess worshipers are
anti-male. Most worship groups say men merely need
enlightenment, that once they embrace the Goddess they, too,
can find greater glory. But some aren't so sure. To them, men
are "PJ's" short for patriarchal jerks, the font of the
world's ills, a lost cause, beyond redemption. Tempers can
quickly flare: When one Goddess magazine, Sage Woman,
suggested men could join the movement, some of its 3,000
readers canceled their subscriptions in protest.
   Barbara Malcolm, a graduate student at the University of
Southern California, videotaped a ceremony near Los Angeles
that was equally impassioned. The Ocean Amazons were meeting
that day, and the women were sharing war stories about PJ's
they once knew and loved. "Be with us now]" they beseeched
the Goddess. "Help us emerge from our dark traps of
self-doubt."
   They dug a hole in the ground and stuffed it full of
pictures of fashion models torn from magazines -- more male
objectification of women, the Ocean Amazons felt. "I am
incensed by Madison Avenue," seethed one. "Death to the
patriarchy]" she shouted, jamming an ad for liposuction into
the hole. Afterward, the women gazed at themselves in
hand-held mirrors. "I am Goddess," each intoned.
   But men who might feel alienated by all of this can take
heart: A new spiritual movement -- a sort of sexual
counterpoint to Goddess worship -- is gaining favor. This one
is called the "mythopoetic men's movement" and considers
itself a refuge from male-bashing, a place where men can go
to explore their own "gender-spirituality."
   When mythopoetic groups meet, the conversation tends
toward how women exploit men and objectify them as work
objects. The groups explore a masculinity of yore, one they
see as steeped in courage, compassion, fathering and
chivalry. Shepherd Bliss, a San Francisco psychologist,
guides mythopoetic groups into the woods, where they sing
songs, read poetry, revere warrior figures and beat drums.
"We want to recreate the wild man -- someone vital and
fresh," he declares.
   In one recent outing, he says, the men crawled on all
fours, pretending to be animals. They had mud fights, engaged
in bragging contests and urinated together on trees. They
made masks "to allow the primitive side to develop." They
cradled each other and meditated. "We cook for ourselves. We
tell stories. We spend a lot of time weeping," Mr. Bliss
says.
   Sometimes, on the hillsides around Los Angeles, the
spiritual movements meet. On a recent afternoon, a
mythopoetic group beat its drums above Malibu. The 200 men
were searching for lost masculinity and a link to Father
Earth. Their efforts were briefly interrupted, however, when
a group of Goddess worshipers, holding a ritual for Mother
Earth nearby, let go with their primal screams.
   Some of the men were enraged, but not Rick Welt. "There
was a sense of communication, of being whole with the women,
even if it just happened on a psychic level," he says. "It
was the epitome of sacredness in the 1990s."
