   To hear Peter Skerry tell it ("Hispanic Job Discrimination
Exaggerated," editorial page, April 27), employment
discrimination against Hispanics is "exaggerated." The
villains are Hispanic leaders -- abetted by "their liberal
allies" -- who conspire to circulate the pernicious notion
that "America is the land of racial discrimination."
   What is truly pernicious is Mr. Skerry's effort to deny
that discrimination on the basis of race, national origin and
alienage or citizenship status is still entrenched. Until
people recognize bias is not a problem that was "taken care
of" in the 1960s, but one that has been ignored in many
respects since then, it is unlikely there will be a serious
national commitment to combat discrimination in all its
forms.

   The reality is that the employment-sanctions provisions of
the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) have resulted
in unfair disadvantages for substantial numbers of people who
look or sound "foreign." A 1988 hiring audit by the New York
City Commission on Human Rights showed that, of 86 employers
tested, 41% evidenced disparate treatment on the basis of
whether the test caller had an accent or not. The report of
the General Accounting Office confirms the existence of a
widespread problem. In recognition of the problem, the New
York City Human Rights Law now prohibits discrimination on
the basis of alienage or citizenship status.
   Mr. Skerry tries to trivialize or ignore the evidence:
Based on the GAO report, "only" 5% of employers actually
refuse to hire those who look or sound foreign; "only" 29% of
Hispanics who live in Southern California claimed to have
experienced at least some bias personally. Viewed in the
context of the overall Hispanic population of the U.S., Mr.
Skerry is shrugging off discrimination against "only" many
thousands of people. When he describes the practice of some
employers of imposing documentation requirements on "only
those who look or sound foreign" as "technical
non-compliance," it is the principle of equal treatment under
law that he is consigning to the category of the technical.
   His suggestion that a relatively low number of complaints
means IRCA-based discrimination is "not even noticeable to
its victims" (and cannot therefore be widespread) is
disingenuous. As noted in the commission's 1988 report,
immigrants are reluctant to speak out for fear of reprisals
given past experience with government agencies, the existence
of a language barrier and inadequate efforts to communicate
to people harmed the availability of remedies for
discriminatory conduct.
   Perhaps most destructive is Mr. Skerry's assertion that
Hispanics do not face the same problems as African-Americans.
It is essential that both communities resist the temptation
to spend any energy arguing the proper arrangement of a
hierarchy of discrimination. We must recognize that the fight
against discrimination is one and indivisible, and our
efforts must be directed accordingly.
