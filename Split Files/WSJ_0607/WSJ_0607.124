   WASHINGTON -- Eastman Kodak Co. apparently has failed in
its efforts to persuade the government to drop an
investigation that could lead to higher tariffs or import
quotas on fixed-focus 35mm and 110-type cameras from Asia,
Latin America and other parts of the world.
   The investigation was launched in response to a complaint
by Keystone Camera Products Corp., Clifton, N.J., calling for
import restrictions "on behalf of the U.S. industry." Despite
objections from Kodak, the U.S. International Trade
Commission was readying a letter notifying the Rochester,
N.Y.-based company that it would continue the inquiry, U.S.
officials said.

   The officials said the ITC will decide in late July
whether to recommend to President Bush that he order
restrictions on the imports.
   The Keystone petition was filed under a provision of the
1974 Trade Act which allows the government temporarily to
block imports that are harming a domestic industry, even if
the harm doesn't result from any trade violation.
   Keystone argued that without such protection, it will be
forced to shift its production to other countries. It charged
that Kodak "has, for all intents and purposes, abandoned U.S.
production {of the fixed-focus cameras} in favor of importing
from facilities in low-cost countries."
   Kodak attorneys replied that the company is producing and
assembling 35mm cameras in U.S. factories, although they said
it has been assembling some U.S.-manufactured parts for 35mm
and 110-type cameras in factories in Mexico and Brazil for
eventual sale in the U.S. market.
