   The South Cuyama field produces about 1,000 barrels a day
of crude oil and 2.5 million cubic feet a day of natural gas
from 93 wells. The sale also included a gas treatment plant
in New Cuyama, Calif.
   Discovered in 1949 by Richfield Oil Co., a predecessor
company of Atlantic Richfield of Los Angeles, the field
reached peak production in 1951 and continued to be
significant through the early 1960s. Atlantic Richfield said
its California oil production is currently about 50,000
barrels a day.
