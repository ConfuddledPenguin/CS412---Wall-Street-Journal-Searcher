   NEW YORK -- Here's Wall Street's latest tactic to lure
investors:
   MAKE THE WORDS BIGGER.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a marketing ploy, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. this week
issued what it says is the first "large-type" prospectus for
an investment product issued by a major brokerage house.
   Everything in the oversize prospectus, including the fine
print, is about a third larger than normal; that increased
the document to 26 pages from 24.
   The name and logo alone take up four inches on the cover,
but perhaps that's understandable. The name is Shearson's
Directions Unit Investment Trust Series 86.
   The big-type version costs Shearson more money, of course.
But the brokerage company, a unit of American Express Co.,
thinks it can make back even more by attracting more
investors whose eyes may have faded. (Unit trusts are already
attracting investors with an average age of 59, six years
older than the typical Shearson customer's age of 53.)
   "It's a `value-added' kind of thing," says Shearson's
director of unit trusts, Robert Topol, who's 65 himself. Mr.
Topol says a typical unit-trust investor "is the older
client, and he has more money. And if he's like me, if I
don't have bright lights I can't read easily, and if I can't
have big print, I can't read it right."
   But does bigger type mean a better investment? Not
necessarily. Many unit trusts -- which are unmanaged
portfolios with a fixed set of securities, often municipal
bonds -- have been disappointing. The problem, in part, is
that the portfolios can't be updated to reflect changes in
the marketplace.
   Still, at least Shearson is showing interest in a
neglected group of investors, says one expert on marketing to
the mature.
   Ken Dychtwald, chairman of Age Wave Inc. in Emoryville,
Calif., and a Shearson consultant, says Wall Street is used
to catering only to "young, good-looking yuppie types." But
one day, Mr. Dychtwald says, Wall Street will happily
discover what older folks have to offer. "We're talking," he
says, "about trillions of dollars of wealth here."
