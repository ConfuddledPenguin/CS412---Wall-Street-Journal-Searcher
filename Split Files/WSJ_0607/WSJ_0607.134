   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A former defense consultant was
convicted of conspiring to funnel sensitive
military-procurement data to a corporation bidding on a $100
million project.
   A federal district court jury found Mark Saunders guilty
of conspiracy, conversion of government property and six
counts of wire fraud.

   He was the fourth person convicted by trial in the
Operation Ill Wind investigation into Pentagon fraud,
although 34 individuals and corporations have pleaded guilty
as a result of the inquiry, which began nearly two years ago.
   The jury found that Mr. Saunders was a middleman in a
scheme to pass confidential government information from
George Stone, a Navy procurement director, to Thomas Muldoon,
a defense consultant for Norden Systems Inc., a division of
United Technologies Corp.
   Witnesses said Mr. Muldoon then sold the information to
Norden, one of 10 companies competing for a contract to
design sophisticated radar and communications systems for the
Marine Corps. Norden dropped out of the competition when the
investigation began.
   Mr. Stone has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and other
charges in the case, as have three former Norden executives.
Mr. Muldoon has been convicted of participating in an
unrelated scheme to bribe Pentagon procurement officials.
