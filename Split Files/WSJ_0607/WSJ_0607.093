   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is expected to
name the head of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. as Big
Board vice chairman, people familiar with the appointment
said.
   John S. Chalsty, president and chief executive officer of
Donaldson Lufkin, will be installed as one of two Big Board
vice chairmen at the board meeting today, say people close to
the board. He will succeed William A. Schreyer, chairman and
chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., as the
highest-ranking outsider at the exchange.

   Mr. Chalsty couldn't be reached for comment, and the Big
Board declined to comment.
   As with all vice chairmen, Mr. Chalsty would retain his
position at his firm while he serves at the Big Board. Mr.
Chalsty was elected to the exchange's board two years ago and
is also a member of the Big Board's "blue ribbon" panel on
program trading and market volatility, which is expected to
issue a report soon.
   Donaldson Lufkin is a unit of Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the U.S.
   The other of the two Big Board vice chairmen is Donald
Stone, senior partner at exchange specialist firm Lasker,
Stone &amp; Stern.
   The Big Board is also hunting for a new chairman to
succeed John J. Phelan Jr., who plans to retire at year end
after six years in the post. But a new chairman isn't
expected to be named at today's meeting.
