   Genentech Inc. said federal regulators will allow the
company to sell its Activase drug as a treatment for
obstruction of the lungs' arteries, providing a new use for
the company's biggest drug.
   The Food and Drug Administration granted the license this
week, allowing the use of Activase in a condition called
acute massive pulmonary embolism in which blood clots block
blood vessels in the lungs. Clinical trials of patients
suffering from pulmonary embolism showed Activase, a
clot-dissolving agent, to be safe and effective, according to
Genentech, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif.

   The FDA previously approved Activase for treating heart
attacks. This week's approval broadens the drug's use to
another life-threatening condition and could shore up the
market for the drug, which has been smaller than originally
expected.
   About 130,000 patients have been diagnosed with pulmonary
embolism, of which about 10,000 are eligible for the kind of
therapy where Activase would be used, Genentech said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Genentech closed at $27.25, up 12.5 cents.
