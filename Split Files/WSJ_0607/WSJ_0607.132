   NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. gave its
creditors a preview of how the company believes it should be
reorganized under Chapter 11.
   At a crowded meeting in the offices of Drexel's bankruptcy
attorneys, about 100 lawyers for creditors and shareholders
were presented with a broad outline of the proposal. The
"conceptual plan," as one attorney described it, is a far cry
from the detailed reorganization plan that will eventually be
presented to the federal bankruptcy court. And some creditors
said the plan was too vague to be of much help in
negotiations.

   Under the proposal, the bulk of creditors would receive
promissory notes backed by most of Drexel's $2 billion in
assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission, however --
whose $150 million claim makes it one of Drexel's biggest
creditors -- would be paid in cash. Richard Kirby, SEC senior
litigation counsel, said Drexel proposed using the money to
set up a fund to pay certain customer claims against the
company.
   Drexel's proposal also provides for the parent company to
emerge from bankruptcy proceedings as a narrowly focused
financial-services concern; its main business would be
managing the debtor's assets. The surviving Drexel company
also would be able to provide consulting services to
companies that have issued junk bonds, an attorney familiar
with the proposal said.
   Drexel's chief bankruptcy attorney, Alan Miller of Weil,
Gotshal &amp; Manges, said: "We had a very good meeting. . . .
While not everyone was prepared to sign on to what we
proposed, we opened the dialogue."
   The face value of the promissory notes to be issued by
Drexel would be equal to the amount owed to the creditors.
The promissory notes would be paid off as Drexel's assets are
liquidated, though no detailed time frame for the liquidation
was given.
   Some creditors are likely to object, however, to Drexel's
proposal that the securities not be tradable until after 30
months. A procedure would also be set up so that some
creditors would be able to redeem their notes early.
Creditors would be able to inform Drexel of the minimum
amount they will accept for the notes, and Drexel would then
redeem the notes from creditors whose redemption offers are
the lowest.
   Mr. Miller said that under the proposal, the small
creditors of some of the subsidiaries, which joined the
parent company in bankruptcy proceedings a few weeks ago,
would be paid in cash. Subsidiaries that are owed large
amounts by other Drexel companies, such as Drexel Burnham
Lambert Trading Corp., wouldn't fall under this provision,
however, Mr. Miller added. Also, any claims involving
litigation wouldn't be included.
   Creditors said yesterday's meeting with Drexel wasn't
hostile, but most apparently weren't won over by the
proposal. Drexel's creditors' committee, which will play a
major role in negotiating the company's eventual
reorganization plan, will meet today. Although Drexel
presented its plan as the groundwork for reaching a
consensus, the creditors committee is expected to continue
developing its own proposal.
   For creditors, one of the most grating aspects of Drexel's
plan is that current management will be left in charge of the
surviving company. "I think we differ on who should be
managing those assets," said Barry Dichter, a bankruptcy
partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, lawyer for the
central bank of Portugal, a Drexel creditors.
   Separately, in Madrid, a prosecutor charged three former
executives of the former Spanish subsidiary of Drexel Burnham
Lambert with falsification of commercial documents in
connection with last year's flotation of shares in the oil
company Repsol S.A.
   Drexel closed its Spanish unit last July, after confirming
that it had used the names of private individuals to buy
shares in Repsol which it resold to institutional clients. In
doing so, it circumvented restrictions designed to make a
maximum number of shares available to private investors.
