   WASHINGTON -- Switzerland formally applied for membership
in the International Monetary Fund, and is expected to apply
to join the World Bank.
   Switzerland has long had close informal ties with the both
institutions. It is a member of the "Group of 10" industrial
nations, which stands ready to lend to the IMF, when
necessary, to help it provide credit to countries having
international payments difficulties.

   In addition, its three major commercial banks frequently
have been underwriters of World Bank debt, and Switzerland
has contributed to various special World Bank accounts. The
country also is a financial backer of the International
Development Association, a World Bank affiliate which
provides interest-free credits to poorer Third World nations.
   Assuming IMF member countries approve the Swiss
application and the country takes the necessary legal steps
to enable it to sign the IMF's articles of agreement, it
could become a member by year end, according to a spokesman
for the 152-nation agency. World Bank officials said a Swiss
request for membership there will be processed as soon as it
is received. Countries seeking to join the World Bank first
must qualify for membership in the IMF.
   The Swiss Federal Council decided "in principle" in 1982
to join the two international agencies, but it temporarily
shelved the idea in 1986 after Swiss voters rejected the
Swiss government's proposal to join the United Nations.
