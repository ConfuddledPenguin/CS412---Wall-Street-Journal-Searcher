   Placer Dome Inc. said it is considering withdrawing its
229.5 million Canadian dollar (US$196.2 million) offer to
acquire Stikine Resources Ltd., after a group that owns 42%
of Stikine agreed Monday to tender its stock to a rival bid.
   Placer Dome, a big, cash-rich gold producer in Vancouver,
British Columbia, said it won't decide whether to pull its
C$67.50-a-share offer until it obtains further details of the
pact between the Stikine shareholder group and Toronto-based
Corona Corp. Stikine plans to issue an information circular
today that is expected to include details of the "lock-up"
agreement.

   On Monday, Corona announced a sweetened offer to acquire
Stikine and Prime Resources Group Inc., joint owners of a big
gold deposit in northwestern British Columbia. As part of
Corona's offer, holders of Stikine's 3.4 million shares would
receive 6.5 Corona shares and two shares of Corona Gold, a
new unit, for each Stikine share. Stikine holders would also
be eligible to subsequently receive a special stock dividend.
