   FRESNO, Calif. -- Gottschalks Inc. said May sales
increased 23% to $18.4 million from $14.9 million in May

year -- were up 12%, the department-store company said.
   Apparel sales led the increases and home sales also grew,
a Gottschalks official said. For the 17 weeks ended June 2,
sales were up 22% to $71 million from $58.3 million a year
before. Same store sales were up 12% in the period,
