   Alcohol and tobacco advertising foes lobbying for a
legislative crackdown may find the going rough in the wake of
a new Supreme Court ruling.
   Many in the ad community breathed a sigh of relief earlier
this week as the high court, in a decision centered on
advertising by a lawyer, made it harder to restrict any kind
of truthful advertising. The decision may well throw a wrench
in the efforts of several legislators to severely restrict or
even ban tobacco and alcohol advertising altogether.

   "The bottom line is, the ruling means people shouldn't be
quick to conclude that the court is going to permit excessive
regulation or banning of truthful advertising," says Richard
Kurnit, a lawyer specializing in advertising at New York firm
Frankfurt, Garvis, Klein &amp; Selz. "There still is life in the
First Amendment protection of advertising."
   The case at issue, Gary E. Peel vs. Attorney Registration
and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois, concerns a lawyer
who on his stationery listed his certification by a trial
lawyers' group. The state's review board censured the lawyer,
Mr. Peel, for violating its rules forbidding lawyers to
advertise themselves as "certified" or "specialists." The
Illinois Supreme Court agreed.
   The U.S. Supreme Court, though, narrowly held in favor of
Mr. Peel in a 5-4 decision. In its ruling, it held that
"truthful advertising related to lawful activities is
entitled to First Amendment protections." It said that while
a state may prohibit misleading advertising, the letterhead
wasn't "inherently misleading."
   The ruling comes at a time when the industry is facing
more, and better supported, attempts to restrict advertising
of legal products than at perhaps any time in the last few
decades. Especially hard-hit have been tobacco and alcohol
ads.
   At least half a dozen pending bills alone on Capitol Hill
would restrict tobacco ads. Bills sponsored by congressmen
Tom Luken (D., Ohio) and Mike Synar (D., Okla.) would ban the
use of colors or pictures in tobacco ads, basically
permitting only all-text ads. Those bills, along with one
proposed by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), would also allow
state and local governments to come up with their own ad
restrictions. Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) plans to
introduce a bill of his own restricting tobacco advertising
late next week.
   Tobacco and alcohol foes have bolstered their arguments
with previous Supreme Court cases that appeared to allow
greater restrictions on truthful advertising. The most
important of those came in 1986, with Posadas de Puerto Rico
Association vs. Tourism Co. In that case, the court upheld
Puerto Rico's ban on advertising gambling to Puerto Ricans --
even though gambling is legal and the advertising wasn't
false or misleading.
   The Supreme Court appeared to favor ad restrictions again
last year in a case involving State University of New York
students who attempted to sell Tupperware on campus. Both
decisions prompted widespread fears in the ad industry that
alcohol and tobacco foes would make headway in their attempts
to crack down on advertising.
   With this week's ruling on the Peel case, though, some ad
lawyers say the Supreme Court appears to be offering stronger
protection to advertising, in a blow to proposed legislation.
"The Peel case clearly presages a death sentence for this
type of overly broad governmental regulation," asserts Daniel
Jaffe, executive vice president of the Association of
National Advertisers, a trade group.
   Since the Posadas decision, "people who wanted to restrict
commercial speech read it as giving them the green light,"
adds David S. Versfelt, an attorney with the New York firm
Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine. "This opinion, I would
argue, suggests that there isn't a green light to restrict
truthful commercial speech."
   But Douglas Wood, an advertising lawyer at the New York
firm Hall, Dickler, Lawler, Kent, and Friedman, criticizes
the ad industry for putting what he sees as an
over-optimistic spin on the decision. He points out that the
ruling basically split the court, and that there was
disagreement even among the slim majority. The decision also
barely mentioned the Posadas and SUNY decisions so important
to advertisers, relying instead on much narrower precedent
cases pertaining only to lawyer advertising.
   "The industry is desperate to find a case that
re-establishes all the rights to commercial free speech that
Posadas and SUNY undermined," he says. "I would welcome such
a case. But I don't see how anyone can see this case to be
the answer we've been looking for."

   Backer Wins Mazola
                                                                                                       

   Best Foods awarded its $10 million to $15 million Mazola
account to Backer Spielvogel Bates. Backer will take ad
responsibility for Mazola margarine and corn oil, as well as
Mazola no-stick cooking spray and Karo syrup.
   The account had previously been handled by Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising. Both New York agencies are units of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. Best Foods is a unit of CPC
International.
   Best Foods, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., also
named Backer to handle its grocery products unit's spot TV
buying assignment. It named BBDO, an Omnicom agency, to
handle its network TV buying job. BBDO was also awarded
several new product assignments.

   SAATCHI CONSULTING: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.'s consulting
operations will fetch a total of just #80 million (US$134.9
million) to #100 million (US$168.7 million), Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, the beleaguered ad company's new chairman,
told analysts. When Saatchi first put its consulting units up
for sale a year ago, analysts had expected them to bring in
#250 million to #350 million. Saatchi earlier this week
announced plans to sell its largest consulting unit, Hay
Group, for a total of about $81 million.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH AD BAN: France's Cabinet voted to ban all tobacco
advertising in the country effective Jan. 1, 1993, the
Associated Press reported. The bill, which was proposed in
March and is expected to win easy approval in France's
National Assembly, would be among the world's toughest
anti-smoking laws, banning all tobacco advertising, including
tobacco companies' sponsorship of sports and cultural events.
                                                                                                       

   KETCHUM: Hank Seiden, chairman of Ketchum Advertising, New
York, was named to the additional post of executive vice
president of Ketchum Communications, the agency's parent
company.
                                                                                                       

   ADWEEK: David W. Bentley was named director of corporate
advertising sales at Hearst Magazines. Mr. Bentley had been
senior vice president and publishing director of Adweek
magazine.
