   NEW YORK -- Investors, taking profits in some stocks and
shifting into others, pushed stock prices slowly but steadily
lower for the second day running.
   Bond prices moved slightly higher in extremely light
activity after opening lower in the morning on news reports
that the Federal Reserve Board isn't likely to ease interest
rates in the near future. The dollar, meanwhile, rose
slightly against the West German mark and Japanese yen, with
traders generally focusing their attention on non-dollar
currency trades.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.35 points to
close at 2911.65 in moderately active trading. Long-term U.S.
Treasury bond prices rose 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000
of face amount.
   As an example of the shift in emphasis in the stock
market, Argus Research said it is dropping such quality
growth stocks as PepsiCo Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson from its
list of "sacred cows" -- or candidates for inclusion in new
portfolios -- and replacing them with interest-rate sensitive
issues such as utilities and financial institutions.
   "Many of the financial-services companies should benefit
from both lower interest rates and an underlying resilience
in the economy," said A.C. Moore, research director at Argus.
The economy is sluggish, he said, but it isn't facing a
recession. "We're looking for a decline in interest rates
based on slowing economic growth and falling food and oil
prices."
   Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.,
attributed yesterday's sell-off partly to queasiness about
indications that many bears have already been converted to
bulls, suggesting ebbing buying pressure.
   "We've been able to take some profits," said Ben Capaldi,
partner at Brandywine Asset Management, Wilmington, Del.
"People have been tending to throw money at the market," he
said, referring to institutions and index funds scrambling to
get into the market as it rallied through Monday.
   In the bond market, activity was minimal, said Roger
Craig, director of fixed-income investing at Banc One Asset
Management, Columbus, Ohio. He said there wasn't much fallout
from news reports about the Fed's inclination not to ease
rates. "If investors were alarmed, we'd be at an 8.75% yield"
on the Treasury's 30-year bond, he said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell as 164 million shares changing hands on
the New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 872 to 656.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond eased to 8.44%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6885 marks and 152.65 yen, compared with
1.6850 marks and 152.45 yen Tuesday.
