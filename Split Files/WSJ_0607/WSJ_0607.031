   NEW YORK -- Reports suggesting headway is being made in
negotiations on Canada's constitutional deadlock pushed the
Canadian dollar higher against its U.S. counterpart.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and others taking
part in marathon negotiations on the issue of Quebec
province's constitutional status said federal and provincial
officials had made progress in the discussions.

   Neither Mr. Mulroney nor other officials who spoke would
divulge details of the private talks in Ottawa, but their
assessment was enough for the market, which bid the Canadian
dollar steadily higher through the North American day. In
late afternoon New York trading, the Canadian dollar was at
85.49 U.S. cents, up from 85.03 U.S. cents late Tuesday.
   In other dealings, the U.S. dollar rose modestly against
the mark and yen, but slipped slightly against the pound.
   Canada's talks are a last-ditch effort by Mr. Mulroney to
win a consensus among Canada's 10 provinces on a proposed
constitutional amendment that would codify French-speaking
Quebec's status as a "distinct society" within Canada.
   New Brunswick, one of three provinces stubbornly holding
out against the amendment, tentatively agreed Monday to
ratify the measure. Newfoundland and Manitoba oppose it on
grounds that a liberal interpretation of the "distinct
society" clause by Quebec might allow Francophone authorities
to dilute the civil rights of Quebec's sizable
English-speaking minority.
   Quebec has said it won't tolerate any changes to the
amendment and will secede from Canada if it isn't passed. All
10 provinces must ratify the measure by June 23 for it to
become law. The talks have been in session for the past four
days.
   Market participants said there will have to be some
results if the Canadian dollar is to avoid a quick
retracement of yesterday's gains. "If there's no news by the
end of the week, no change in position," the Canadian
currency will fall no matter how evident a "friendly tone"
is, said Thomas Benfer, senior marketing representative at
Bank of Montreal in New York.
   In late afternoon New York trading, the U.S. dollar was at
1.6885 marks, up from 1.6850 marks late Tuesday, and at
152.65 yen, up from 152.45 yen. Sterling was at US$1.6875, up
from US$1.6870.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 152.45 yen
soon after opening at 152.49 yen; it closed in Tokyo
Wednesday at 152.60 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was
trading at about 1.6880 marks, down a bit from Wednesday's
Tokyo close of 1.6888 marks.
   The mark was hurt by reports of possible East German labor
unrest in coming days, giving up small gains to the U.S. and
Japanese currencies, participants said.
   News that owners of small independent businesses in East
Germany have asked their employees to strike in protest of
the current terms of unification heightened market concern
that the costs of unification could rise.
   The small-business owners said they feared being squeezed
by the 1-to-1 conversion of East German mark wages and
salaries into West German marks, which will occur at the same
time business accounts are halved by a 2-to-1 exchange rate.
   The squeeze could jeopardize as many as 350,000 jobs, one
business spokesman said. Groups representing the retail,
restaurant and service industries have called for a strike
today in Berlin and a national walkout tomorrow.
   Comments late in the day by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
that he doesn't see underlying deterioration in the U.S.
economy had little effect on the U.S. dollar.
   The U.S. currency rose slightly against the yen, as market
concerns about Japanese inflation and the large amount of
Japanese debt secured by inflated real-estate prices tended
to balance the positive factor of Japan's robust economy,
said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis.
   In Europe, the dollar ended modestly weaker, although
action was thin and largely focused on non-dollar activity.
In Tokyo, a report that U.S. Federal Reserve officials don't
support lower interest rates helped the dollar edge up.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold
dropped $2.40 to settle at $357.40 an ounce, the lowest close
since July 30, 1986. Estimated volume was a moderate three
million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $456.25 an
ounce.
