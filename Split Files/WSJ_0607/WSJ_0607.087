   Investors favored over-the-counter stocks yesterday as the
OTC market outperformed exchange-listed shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.35 to 464.96, a
0.08% gain, compared with the 13.35-point drop in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. But declining shares edged out
advancers, 990 to 920, as volume eased to 156.5 million
shares from 173.5 million Tuesday.

   Transportation issues were strong amid speculation that
the recent drop in oil prices could lead to lower fuel costs.
The Nasdaq Transportation Index rose 3.80 to 497.19.
Financial, insurance and utility issues also gained.
Technology shares, which lost ground Tuesday, rebounded
slightly.
   Traders said they continue to see evidence that portfolio
managers are favoring smaller stocks that haven't followed
the sharp gains among larger issues. "Institutions want to
make sure their cash is in the right place at the end of the
quarter," said William Rothe, director of OTC trading at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, Baltimore.
   Business was brisk at Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis,
Tenn. according to Hedi Reynolds, senior OTC trader there.
Both institutional and smaller investors showed interest in
stocks that had recently weakened, such as oil service
issues, and continued to selectively buy regional financial
issues, she said.
   History may be repeating itself in favor of smaller
stocks, according to Binkley Shorts, portfolio manager of the
Over-The-Counter Securities Fund, Fort Washington, Pa. In an
interview, Mr. Shorts pointed out that in 1976 larger stocks
peaked before entering a three-year decline. However, during
the same period the Nasdaq index rose 75% as smaller stocks,
which had lagged behind larger issues, caught up.
   "A lot of smart money in 1976 was smart enough to make
that transition {to smaller stocks}," he said. "They had
great years in 1977, 1978 and 1979 in a very dead market"
among larger issues, he added.
   Mr. Shorts said he remains convinced that smaller stocks
are entering a similar cycle, because they are relatively
cheap now compared with the valuations of larger issues. Mr.
Shorts said he prefers investing in the shares of companies
in service sectors, such as restaurant, retail and
environmental clean-up concerns, and with annual revenue
growth of 20% or higher.
   McCaw Cellular Communications Class A shares, the day's
most-active issue, rose 3/4 to 31 1/4 on 2 million shares.
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said that Oppenheimer
&amp; Co. analyst Lior Bregman speculated that Motorola Inc.
might make an announcement within the month that could
involve teaming up with some cellular communications
providers to offer a nationwide cellular network. A Motorola
spokesman declined to comment on the speculation, but
confirmed the company will make an announcement within about
30 days regarding Motorola's involvement in satellite
communications.
   Shares of U S West NewVector Group, a Bellevue, Wash.,
cellular telephone company rose 3/4 to 38 1/8.
   Tyco Toys, among the day's most-active stocks, tumbled 4
3/4 to 22 3/4 after the Mount Laurel, N.J., toy maker said
that it ended acquisition talks with an undisclosed company.
As reported, analysts had speculated that the suitor was
Hasbro Inc.
   Suburu of America traded more than 1.5 million shares.
Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission cleared Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd.'s plan to buy the 50.4% of Suburu of
America's outstanding common shares that it doesn't already
own. The agreement provides Suburu stockholders other than
Fuji with a minimum cash payment of $8.50 a share.
   Adobe Systems and Sun Microsystems both rebounded
following favorable news from the two Mountain View, Calif.,
technology companies. Software maker Adobe said it signed an
agreement with Xerox giving the huge office equipment company
licensing rights to Adobe's PostScript software. Financial
details of the pact weren't disclosed. Adobe rose 1 1/2 to 33
3/4 on 1.3 million shares.
   Sun Microsystems said Tuesday that it will supply hundreds
of UNIX workstations and related products to United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney division for use by
Pratt's design, drafting, analytical and manufacturing
functions. Sun rose 5/8 to 31.
   Among other active technology issues, Oracle Systems rose
7/8 to 21 1/8; Intel climbed 5/8 to 47 3/4; Autodesk rose 3/4
to 49 1/2; Apple Computer was unchanged at 39 1/2, and
Microsoft eased 3/8 to 73.
   Hologic advanced 2 1/4 to 23 1/2 after the Waltham, Mass.,
maker of X-ray systems said it filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an additional 700,000 common shares
to be sold in a secondary offering. Hologic went public
earlier this year.
   Jay Jacobs added 1 to 8 5/8. Tuesday, the Seattle retailer
said May sales rose about 35% and sales for the same stores
open at least one year rose 21% for the month.
   Shares of Society Corp., a Cleveland banking concern,
surged 1 1/2 to 33 1/4 on heavy volume after officials told a
New York meeting of analysts that cost savings from Society's
January acquisition of Trustcorp Inc. are greater than
expected, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. The company said it expects 1990 earnings will
increase and agrees with a Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods estimate
that it will earn $5.30 a share in 1991, compared with net
income of $4.63 a share in 1989, DJPIR said.
   Conmed gained 3/4 to 7 1/2. Robert Shallish, chief
financial officer of the Utica, N.Y., maker of disposable
medical and surgical products told DJPIR that he spoke
yesterday morning with an Ohio Co. analyst about the
company's financial picture. Mr. Shallish told DJPIR that the
company expects its earnings for the second-quarter ending in
June to match the 20 cents a share net income for the first
quarter. In the 1989 second quarter, Conmed had net income of
nine cents a share.
   Pharmacy Management slid 1 1/8 to 16 1/8 after the medical
cost-containment company reported net income for the third
quarter ended April 30 of seven cents a share, up from four
cents a year earlier. The company went public in April at $12
a share in an offering co-managed by Robertson Stephens and
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. DJPIR reported that Robertson Stephens
analyst Vivian Wohl lowered her 1991 estimate for the company
to a range of 75 to 85 cents a share from an earlier estimate
of 84 cents, but continues to rate the stock a "buy."
