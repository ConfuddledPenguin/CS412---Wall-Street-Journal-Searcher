   A widely used treatment for chronic back pain, one of the
nation's most common ailments, isn't any more effective in
relieving symptoms than no treatment at all, medical
researchers say.
   Their findings, published in today's New England Journal
of Medicine, are certain to provoke controversy among
patients, doctors and manufacturers of devices for the
therapy, called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,
or TENS. Indeed, one maker of the devices disputed the
conclusions and asserted that the study is flawed.

   About 31 million Americans suffer from low back pain,
which accounts for about one-quarter of all lost workdays and
for about $16 billion in medical costs each year. Researchers
say that eight of 10 people suffer back pain at some point
during their lifetimes. Doctors usually can neither pinpoint
the cause of the pain nor prescribe a cure. While a variety
of treatments are available, little is known about how well
they work.
   Electrical nerve stimulation, in which pulses of
electricity are administered through electrodes taped to the
body, is one such treatment. The intent is to negate or block
the transmission of pain sensation from the inflamed area to
the brain.
   Typically, patients buy TENS units for as much as $600, or
rent them for $60 to $90 a month, and use them at home. The
devices are covered by most insurers, including Medicare and
many Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield plans. Medtronic Inc.,
Minneapolis, Empi Inc. and Medical Devices Inc., both St.
Paul, Minn., and Staodynamics Inc., Longmont, Colo., are
among companies that make the devices.
   A research team headed by Richard A. Deyo of the Seattle
(Wash.) Veterans Affairs Medical Center, found that 47% of
patients treated with TENS for four weeks reported
improvement in pain symptoms while 42% of those administered
with a placebo or dummy treatment experienced similar relief.
   The study involved 145 patients, half of whom received
actual electrical stimulation from a TENS device and half of
whom used the same equipment but with the electrical pulse
disabled.
   In addition, half of each group also were assigned a daily
regimen of stretching and other exercises in combination with
the treatment. In each case, their symptoms improved over the
treatment alone, the researchers said.
   But among all patients, in a follow-up two months after
treatment ceased, only those who continued to exercise
maintained improved symptoms. And "there was little evidence
. . . of change in behavior or daily functioning" in any
case, they said.
   "The study is saying that for chronic low back pain, the
TENS unit isn't an effective treatment," says Nicholas E.
Walsh, chairman of physical medicine and rehabilitation at
the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio,
and a co-author of the study.
   It also suggests, the researchers concluded, "active"
exercise would be more beneficial than "passive" treatment
such as TENS for chronic back pain, although a longer period
of exercise than 30 days may be necessary to provide
significant improvement.
   Not surprisingly, makers of TENS devices disagree. Michael
Connoy, president of Empi, maintains the study shows that
TENS is just as good as exercise for low back pain, and thus
particularly appropriate for patients who are unable to
exercise regularly. In addition, he charged that 30-day
treatment evaluated in the study is too short to determine
its effectiveness, that the intensity of the electric pulse
was too low, and that a 45-minutes-a-day session, as required
of participants in the study, is too short, especially when
patients first use the devices.
   Mr. Connoy also said the U.S. Office of Inspector General
recently issued a report saying that 80% of Medicare patients
surveyed believed the units were beneficial in reducing lower
back pain, and that most of 26 doctors surveyed also
considered them useful.
   Mr. Connoy said Empi expects to sell about 40,000 of the
units this year, with a value of about $15 million, up from
$12.2 million last year. He estimated that national market at
$75 million.
   Units from Empi were used in the study, Dr. Walsh said.
   In addition to patients, purchasers of TENS units include
physical and occupational therapists, chiropractors and
physicians, Dr. Walsh said. Other treatments for back pain
range from various drugs, including pain relievers, muscle
relaxants and anti-depressants, to traction, exercise,
chiropractic manipulation, massage, acupuncture and
biofeedback.
   Few controlled studies have been done to determine the
effectiveness of any of these approaches, Dr. Walsh says. "We
spend a fortune {on back pain} in this country," he says.
"We've spent very little on research into what's effective."
