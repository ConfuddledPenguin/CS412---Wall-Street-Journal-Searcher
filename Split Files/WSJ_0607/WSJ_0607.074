   LONDON -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., a New York-based securities
firm, said it launched Austro-Hungary Fund Ltd., a $50
million closed-end fund to invest in listed stocks in the
Austrian and Hungarian markets. A closed-end fund issues a
fixed number of shares that are traded like stocks.
   The dollar-denominated fund is expected to be the first
foreign company listed on the Hungarian Stock Exchange when
that market reopens on June 21, said Charles Lillis, a
director of Merrill Lynch's international unit here.

   The fund's portfolio will be equally divided between
Austrian and Hungarian issues, with the Austrian investments
emphasizing companies with business links to Hungary, said
Peter Kysel, a managing director of Lloyds Investment
Management International, the new fund's adviser.
