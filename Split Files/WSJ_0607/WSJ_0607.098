   L.J. Hooker Corp. said it will liquidate five of the six
stores that comprise Sakowitz Inc., a Houston-based specialty
chain.
   A sixth store, in a Hooker-owned mall outside Cincinnati
will remain open indefinitely to preserve the value of the
mall, according to a Hooker spokesman.

   Sakowitz filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this
May. Atlanta-based L.J. Hooker, which is a unit of
Australia-based Hooker Corp., filed for Chapter 11 in August
1989. L.J. Hooker has since liquidated its B. Altman &amp; Co.
chain, as well as most of Bonwit Teller.
   Robert Sakowitz, former president and chief executive
officer of the retail chain, said in a statement that he
"deeply regrets" the end of a Houston institution and noted
that he had spent many months trying to raise capital to buy
the chain.
