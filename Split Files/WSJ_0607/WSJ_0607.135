   LANCASTER, Pa. -- Armstrong World Industries Inc. said it
agreed to resolve all "outstanding issues" between the
company and affiliates of Canada's Belzberg family by paying
the Belzbergs a net sum of about $4.4 million.
   On May 30, the Belzbergs' various holding companies sold
their 11.7% stake in the flooring and building-products
concern at an estimated $18 million loss, ending a yearlong
effort to effect a takeover of the company.

   Under the agreement, the Belzbergs dropped all litigation
against the company, including a challenge to Pennsylvania's
recently enacted takeover law and a lawsuit seeking a binding
vote on five corporate-governance amendments. Armstrong
withdrew all countersuits.
   The Belzbergs also agreed to limit their holdings of
Armstrong stock to no more than 50,000 shares for 10 years.
Any stock owned can be held only for investment purposes, and
the Belzberg companies are specifically prohibited from
engaging in a business combination with Armstrong.
   As part of the formal settlement, Armstrong will pay the
Belzbergs $5 million, and the Belzbergs will pay Armstrong
$605,000.
   Armstrong said it agreed to settle the issues to end the
disruption and expense caused by the suits. "The settlement
is a natural consequence of the sale of the Belzberg shares,"
a spokesman said.
