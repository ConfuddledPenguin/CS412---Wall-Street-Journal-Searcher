   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals-court panel in San
Francisco overturned a Federal Communications Commission
decision to allow the Bell companies to combine their
regulated and unregulated subsidiaries.
   The three-judge panel said the agency's decision was
"unlawfully arbitrary and capricious," and sent the matter
back to the FCC for further consideration. The appeals court
criticized the agency for basing its decision on insufficient
information. The court's ruling could be a setback for the
Bell companies. Although there has been relatively little
integration so far, the Bells believe that combining
regulated and nonregulated operations would improve
efficiencies and help to cut costs. The FCC said it was
reviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment.

   The 1985 FCC decision, known as Computer III, grew out of
the agency's efforts to regulate the increasing
interdependence of telephones and computers, and actions to
encourage the development of a robust "enhanced-services"
industry. Enhanced services generally refer to computer-based
services that benefit customers, such as storing data within
the telephone network.
   After the Bell System breakup in 1984, the commission
required so-called structural separation of unregulated and
regulated businesses. In August 1985, however, the commission
decided to lift that requirement, replacing it with so-called
nonstructural safeguards to prevent cross subsidies and other
anti-competitive behavior.
   Yesterday, the court vacated two FCC orders: one that
allowed the Bell companies to merge their regulated telephone
operations with unregulated businesses, and a second that
pre-empted state regulation of telephone companies' provision
of enhanced services.
   Spokesmen for some Bell companies, including Pacific
Telesis Group and Bell South Corp., said company lawyers were
studying the decision and had no immediate comment. A
spokesman for MCI Communications Corp., which had petitioned
for the appeals-court review, said the company "is delighted
with the decision. The regulated and nonregulated Bell
company subsidiaries should be separate."
   In a summary of its decision, the court noted that the FCC
abruptly reversed itself just 14 months after arguing that
the Bell System breakup didn't reduce the need for separate
subsidiaries. At that time, the FCC presented a new argument:
Changes in the telecommunications marketplace cut the risks
of Bell companies using revenues from their monopoly phone
businesses to help their competitive and growing
enhanced-services businesses.
   The court said the record compiled by the commission in
the Computer III proceeding "yields no support for the
commission's position that market and technological changes
have reduced the danger of cross subsidization" by the Bell
companies. Thus, it said, it was arbitrary and capricious to
drop the requirement for separate units and rely instead on
cost-accounting regulations to protect consumers and
competitors.
   Nevertheless, the summary said the commission "made a
plausible case" that consumers would benefit from lifting the
requirements because the Bell companies could operate more
efficiently and that the growth of technologies that bypass
the local phone networks would reduce the threat that Bell
companies would discriminate against competitors in providing
access to their networks.
   As for pre-empting the states on regulation of
enhanced-service providers, the court said the agency "failed
to carry its burden of showing that its pre-emption orders
are necessary to avoid frustrating its regulatory goals." It
is unlikely, however, that the agency will determine that
regulation should revert to the states, creating a crazy
quilt of rules for enhanced-service providers.
