   As the Romanian election results hit the newsroom of
Romania Libera, the mood became sober. Romania Libera is
Romania's largest independent newspaper, and might be
expected to welcome change in the former communist state. But
the paper's editors recognize that the victory of Romania's
National Salvation Front means they stand a good chance of
facing more old-world-style oppression.
   The people gathered in the executive editor's office were
worried because they had done what newspapers do in
democratic countries: criticized a political grouping. In
their case, the target of criticism had been the National
Salvation Front. That group served as the political umbrella
under which, after the December revolution, the communists
who lost Romania's civil war found refuge. Now, under the
cover of the Front, they have won the peace. Journalists at
Romania Libera fear that their paper will top the hit-list.

   Given the frailty of democracy in Romania now, they have
good reason to fear. Already, post-Ceausescu, the newspaper
had faced harassment: anonymous phone threats, sabotage of
distribution, public attacks from government officials.
   Control is, of course, nothing new to the Romanian press
-- or to Romania Libera's staff. The previous regime used the
press as a propaganda machine. Under the Ceausescu clique,
even a small typographical error could get a few editors
fired. The government controlled Romania Libera in that era.
   But three Romania Libera journalists were arrested for
trying to publish a "samizdat". Two of them, Anton Uncu and
Mihai Creanga, endured six months of interrogation before
they went free. Demonstrators who overthrew Ceausescu
liberated a third, Petre Mihai Bacanu. Together with Florica
Ichim, another democratic thinker, these gentlemen formed the
nucleus that took over Romania Libera after the dictator's
fall. They changed the direction of the paper, transforming
it into the main voice of anti-communist forces. They
retained the paper's old name, Romania Libera ("Free
Romania"), because they saw a certain prophecy in it.
   To understand the importance of Romania Libera, it helps
to review the press scene. More than a thousand papers were
born after Ceausescu's death. Seven appear daily. Their
circulation is, by American standards, huge. Romania Libera
sells close to 1.5 million papers daily -- an outstanding
figure given Romania's population of 23 million.
   Many of these papers have only four, or, occasionally, six
pages. They lack advertising; they have few headlines. These
are so obscure it is hard to tell what the article underneath
is about. News drowns in a sea of commentary.
   Politically, Romania Libera is unique among the dailies.
Other newspapers changed their names in an attempt to escape
the old communist taint. But even under their new names,
those papers kept their old political affiliations. They even
felt comfortable with the brand of neo-communism that the new
provisional government, the National Salvation Front, has
embraced. Two of the nation's seven dailies belong to the
organized opposition, the Liberal and Peasant parties. Four,
including Adevarul, Romania Libera's main competitor, are
controlled by the Front (Adevarul, in fact, is the old
Communist Party organ, printed under a different name).
   That means that the only important paper independent of a
political party is Romania Libera. In fact, it's not hard to
see the similiarity between Romania Libera and La Prensa, the
Nicaraguan paper around which opposition rallied during
Daniel Ortega's regime. Beyond the press, Front leaders
control other media: radio and television.
   Today's neo-communists, of course, are more sophisticated
in their censorship. Against Romania Libera, they are using a
velvet glove instead of a mailed fist. They have many
advantages on their side: The printing presses on which
Romania Libera is printed were bought from the government.
The government controls distribution. The government also
collects subscription fees and puts them in a government
bank. Editors fear the government will take over the paper
and publish it itself.
   To avoid that, the journalists at Romania Libera have
taken a brave step. Editors have made use of a decree made
during the honeymoon period shortly after the Ceausescus'
demise. The decree allows private enterprises -- but if they
have fewer than 20 employees. Because Romania Libera employs
about 120 journalists, editors like Messrs. Uncu and Bacanu
have set up six companies, with fewer than 20 staffers each.
In this way Romania Libera became the first private
enterprise in Romania -- it even got the first certificate of
privatization, number 001, to prove it]
   But the struggle had just begun. In an attempt to place
obstacles before the paper, the government tripled the price
of paper overnight. (Significantly, the regime did not raise
prices on other staples.) This move cut into Romania Libera's
profits -- leaving it with only a 10% margin. (At the black
market rate, the paper costs only about a penny a copy.) In
addition, the government cut paper supplies: Romania Libera's
circulation has been reduced to 870,000 from 1.5 million
because the authorities claim a "lack of paper."
   The government hindered distribution by delaying thousands
of copies left in the warehouse. Its justification for this
step was an odd one: It argued that the papers "don't sell."
This is strange considering that in Romania these days, the
lines of people who want to buy papers are longer than the
ones of those who want to buy food. In the case of Romania
Libera, the shortage created a new brand of crime, newspaper
theft. The paper's editors have printed reports of newspaper
thieves who steal thousands of papers and sell them for 10
times the price.
   Phone threats have also come -- threats that, given the
violence that has taken place in this country lately, have to
be taken seriously. The Front's most recent efforts to
discredit the paper have been attacks in the press or ones
direct from government officials. Adevarul tried to associate
the paper with neo-Nazis.
   Now that, after the election, the Front has a firmer
control of power, editors will continue to fight for the free
press in Romania. They feel they have no choice. Before the
election, Prime Minister Petre Roman called Romania Libera a
"dirty rag." Defending democracy, the editors at Romania
Libera acknowledge, might be seen by some as a dirty job.
But, they point out, somebody's got to do it.
