   HOLLYWOOD -- Executives at Walt Disney Co. don't want to
discuss it much, but he's out there, a shadowy figure,
gliding through alleys, stalking the city: Batman.
   To most people, last summer's box office sensation may be
as old news as T-shirts at the bottom of the drawer. But the
specter of "Batman" haunts Disney as it prepares to release
its own crime-fighter flick, "Dick Tracy," June 15. During
these last critical days, Disney is playing the hard game of
balancing essential hype with the perils of sky-high
expectations.

   Even as they unleash a last-minute barrage of publicity,
riddle TV screens with more than a dozen different
commercials, plug the movie with at least nine posters --
devoting an estimated $30 million to marketing and other
costs of the release -- Disney executives hope they're not
setting themselves up for a fall.
   It's a situation of their own making. Because of a host of
built-in marketing difficulties, Disney set out to create
"Dick Tracy" as an "event" movie. But if it's going to be an
event -- where moviegoers feel they must see it -- it has to
draw young viewers who rush to see it, tell their friends,
then plunge back into the theaters.
   "Dick Tracy" is a perfectly good movie, says Scott
Wallace, president of Act 3 Communications' theater unit,
based in Los Angeles. "Very playable," he adds. It better be,
since he's booked the film into many of his theaters. But, he
adds, "it's no Batman. I'll be delighted to see it do $100
million" at the box office.
   Only a handful of films, including "Batman," have ever hit
$200 million, but as the movie business enters a high-stakes
summer predicted to break last year's box office record,
perception counts for a lot. Four films already have hit $100
million this year. "Ghostbusters II" grossed $100 million
last year but is considered a disappointment in Hollywood.
   "There's no analogy to `Batman' in any sense," says Disney
studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, "and any expectation or
comparison based on it would be foolish on our part. For a
movie to do $200 million is a freak of nature." Mr.
Katzenberg won't discuss his expectations for "Dick Tracy,"
but some Disney executives say their own romantic comedy
"Pretty Woman" may turn out to be the year's No. 1 movie.
   But the comparison of "Dick Tracy" with "Batman" is no
coincidence, as Disney well knows. The company is targeting
the film to all audiences, but the slightly square
comic-strip character, whose heyday dates back several
decades, is no more familiar to many young viewers than the
Katzenjammer Kids.
   That didn't bother Disney. The company doesn't invite new
characters into its stable casually: Its ethos is a tightly
controlled one, whether in the phalanxes of lawyers guarding
the copyrights on Mickey Mouse and friends or in the
self-contained atmosphere of its theme parks.
   Disney's vaunted marketing machine set about reinventing
Dick Tracy. The beauty of it, a Disney executive says, is
that although the title has a "resonant feeling" and provides
a "deep tug" to adults, for most young people, Dick Tracy can
be whatever Disney turns him into. "It's like `The
Untouchables,'" the movie executive says, referring to
Paramount Pictures' successful 1987 release. "The adults
remember it, and the kids discover it."
   Richard Cook, head of Disney's film distribution arm,
adds: "We looked at it as an asset. It's not that much unlike
the way we reintroduce our classic films to each young
generation every seven years."
   Another problem Disney faces is that unlike its
competitors, which this summer have Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson
and Arnold Schwarzenegger to sell, it has 53-year-old Warren
Beatty, whose last film before the disastrous "Ishtar" was
"Reds" in 1981. Worse yet, much of the publicity Mr. Beatty
is generating, dwelling on his amorous proclivities, is
negative. Disney isn't even trying to market him to young
viewers. And while "Batman" had Jack Nicholson, "Dick Tracy"
has Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman, but Disney can't advertise
them because they were paid as actors rather than stars.
   So, as Warner did with "Batman," Disney has spent months
selling the concept and look of the movie. Starting last
Christmas, it rolled out three logos and three in-theater
trailers. The goal, which appears to have been achieved, was
ensuring that nearly everyone in the nation knows about the
film.
   "We knew the picture had achieved `event' status," says
Mr. Cook. The question of whether people get a shivery sense
of anticipation when they think about it is a different
matter. Disney, which says it has been too early for research
to track "want-to-see" until just about now, dismisses
Hollywood scuttlebutt that the film ranks low in some
surveys.
   While the buildup to the movie itself was proceeding, more
than 70 merchandising licenses were bid out to marketers of
T-shirts, watches, raincoats and toys. Sixteen different
high-concept villains, including Pruneface and Flattop, add
to the mix. Dick Tracy's profile isn't as ubiquitous as
batwings were, but the idea is the same.
   The "Batman" similarities continue in the film itself: the
overpowering, cartoonlike music by Danny Elfman, who composed
both scores; the self-contained setting of the film, achieved
with striking production design; and Mr. Beatty, like Michael
Keaton, in the title role as a determinedly self-deprecating
hero.
   Disney privately claims to have made "Dick Tracy" for a
relatively paltry $30 million; other estimates range up to
$40 million, including $8 million for Mr. Beatty. Disney says
that during the 10 years that a "Dick Tracy" project was
circulating in Hollywood, three other studios had a crack at
making it but couldn't figure out how to do it cheaply
enough, because of the costs of set building and expensive
location work.
   Disney solved the problem by putting the entire production
into a sound stage. As director, Mr. Beatty reportedly was
made financially responsible for any cost overruns, and Mr.
Katzenberg, the studio chief, kept a rein on Mr. Beatty's
tendency to tinker endlessly.
   It helped that Madonna, who plays Breathless Mahoney,
worked for relatively little. With her wildly successful
concert tour storming the world these past few months,
Madonna's presence in the movie could have been the answer to
Disney's problem of attracting teen-agers. But they haven't
highlighted her in the marketing.
   For one thing, Madonna's track record in movies has been
spotty. But Disney executives also were wary of Madonna's
brand of kinky weirdness. Her current tour includes simulated
sex interspersed with religious imagery and sadomasochism,
and characters wearing Dick Tracy overcoats and hats dancing
in bikini briefs.
   Soon after, the company decided to shift "Dick Tracy" to
its Touchstone imprint, reserved for more adult-oriented
films, from the Disney name. Fearing that the Disney label
turns off teen-agers, the company has long wanted to broaden
it, and "Dick Tracy" -- despite a PG rating, some stylized
machine-gun fire and a sultry moment or two from Madonna --
is suitable for young kids. But Madonna's public persona just
doesn't jibe with the Disney label, executives feared.
   Despite the risks, Disney has enough confidence in "Dick
Tracy" to have been screening the picture for the media for
more than two weeks. Exhibitors who have seen the film are
generally enthusiastic.
   But "there's no such thing as a leadpipe cinch," says Mr.
Cook. Every film has to please audiences. "Batman" didn't get
great reviews, but the film had a certain hypnotic pull on
young people.
   Still, at its relatively low cost, "Dick Tracy" is much
less of a financial gamble than Fox's "Die Hard II" or
Paramount Pictures' "Days of Thunder." The reputation of
Disney's film executives is safe for 1990 with the sleeper
success of "Pretty Woman." Disney's stock price, now as
always, has more to do with theme park attendance than
movies.
   But Disney wants more than just a hit movie: It wants to
welcome Dick Tracy into the synergistic fold, selling the
merchandise in its chain of stores, building theme park
attractions based on the character, and having the film join
the theater and video rotation of Disney classics. If the
film should somehow prove a flop, the only real risk may be
to the company's pride.
