   DIVIDEND INCREASES slow in response to lower corporate
profits.
   There have been 653 dividend increases this year, 175
fewer than last year at this time, says Arnold Kaufman of
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Given the current pace, he estimates
1990 will see no more than 1,480 increases -- the lowest
since "the early 1970s' dividend freeze under the Nixon
administration." Other gloomy statistics: Some 109 companies
have omitted dividends, double the year-earlier number, while
46 companies have decreased their dividend, compared with 38
last year.

   "Dividends lag profits and profits have been deteriorating
for the last year or so," says Marshall Acuff of Smith
Barney. The picture, he says, may begin brightening as
profits start to improve in the second half. But Carmine
Grigoli of First Boston is less optimistic. He says any
improvement in earnings will reflect last-year's big
writeoffs, not real profit growth this year.
   Still, dividend dollars for the S&amp;P 500 will increase 9%
this year, as 1989's record number of dividend hikes are felt
for the first full year, Mr. Kaufman says.
                                                                                                       

   HOSPITAL CHARGES rank last as a good buy with consumers.
   A Conference Board survey of 7,000 families finds some 61%
of consumers believe they're getting "poor" value for their
money with hospital charges. Other areas of high consumer
dissatisfaction: lawyers' fees, premium pay TV, auto
insurance and college tuition. Used cars received almost
universally poor ratings, but new U.S. cars ranked nearly on
a par with foreign cars. "Sudden price rises make buyers feel
they are getting less value for their dollars," says Fabian
Linden, executive director for the board's consumer research
center.
   What do consumers see as a good buy? Poultry tops the
list, with more than two of every five rating it a "good"
value. Close behind are videotape rentals, TV sets, fruits
and vegetables and appliances. Also seen as good values are
meat, pet food, haircuts, fish, electricity, restaurant meals
and telephone service. "People tend to have a sound intuitive
sense of what things should cost," Mr. Linden says, noting
the average consumer has been shopping for 25 years.
                                                                                                       

   PRODUCT REFORMULATION gains ground as environmental
concerns grow.
   Corporate America is focusing more attention on trying to
get solvents, chlorofluorocarbons, heavy metals and other
unecological chemicals out of their products. The paint
industry, for one, is advocating "absolute, total
reformulation" as part of a call for national standards, says
Thomas Graves of the National Paint and Coatings Association,
Washington. The idea: "To bite the bullet once rather than
biting the bullet many times over" as states pass new
regulations on hydrocarbons.
   Efforts to replace solvents at 3M, begun in 1975, have
brought reformulation of such things as adhesive in
electrical tape. "We've got research projects going for every
major solvent use in the company," says Rick Renner,
spokesman. Growing concern over the use of heavy metals in
plastics' pigments prompts the Society of the Plastics
Industry to ponder developing protocols for evaluating
materials environmentally.
   By mid-July, Dow Chemical Co. will have phased out CFCs as
blowing agents used in making Styrofoam insulation.
                                                                                                       

   BIG MAC PRICES are one way to determine a currency's
worth, says Heiko Thieme of Deutsche Bank in New York. By
extrapolating implied purchasing power based on Big Mac
prices, he concludes that Hong Kong, Singapore and
Yugoslavian currencies are greatly undervalued.
                                                                                                       

   A FAMILIAR FACE: Since coming to power in 1985, Mikhail
Gorbachev has been mentioned twice as often on network news
as Pope John Paul II, says Joe Foote, a Southern Illinois
University professor. In 1989 alone he was mentioned 645
times, almost half as many as President Bush.
                                                                                                       

   MASHED SQUASH or pumpkin won't be accepted in the
home-canned food competition at the Missouri State Fair. Nor
will jams and jellies sealed with paraffin. Why? Neither
method complies with new U.S. Department of Agriculture
safety guidelines on home canning issued last year.
                                                                                                       

   DANCE COMPANY WOES reflect growing costs and limited
dollars.
   Layoffs, cancelled seasons and red ink are taking center
stage in the dance world. Dance Theatre of Harlem cancelled
its New York season this winter after unexpectedly losing key
bookings. The Joffrey Ballet -- short some $2 million --
nearly cut the last three stops of its season when artistic
director Gerald Arpino briefly resigned after doing battle
with his board. And the venerable American Ballet Theater is
tightening its belt, reducing the size of the company to try
to make ends meet.
   "The dance business today is reaping problems that have
their genesis in the dance boom of the '70s," says Richard
Philp of Dance Magazine. Having expanded, companies are now
finding costs rising at a time when new dollars are harder to
find. Audience growth "can't keep pace with the number of
companies," says Jane Hermann, ABT director, of the shakeout
in progress.
   The impact: fewer performances, fewer new productions and
smaller companies, company officials say.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Lotus Development Corp. sells a book of poetry
written by employees to benefit organizations that care for
AIDS patients. . . . Counseling by Mail, launched by two
Manhattan psychotherapists, is designed to provide mail-order
therapy for shy, busy or housebound people.
