   MELNIK, Czechoslovakia -- As dusk settles over rural
Bohemia, a weary Valtr Komarek hurries through a snack-bar
dinner before his fifth and last campaign speech of the day.
   As his Civic Forum aides dine on pork chops and local
wine, the first deputy prime minister and favored candidate
in the district is subdued. Last November's "Velvet
Revolution" ended 40 years of Communist rule. But the cloak
of good will and consensus that wrapped the country is
unraveling, as easy transitions to democracy and free markets
prove elusive.

   "The velvet has some holes in it now," says Mr. Komarek, a
59-year-old academic economist. "There is a sort of
pre-election restlessness, even aggressivity. The humanism is
gone."
   Tensions heightened after a bomb exploded in Prague's Old
Town Square last Saturday, injuring 19 people and inflaming
suspicions that supporters of the old regime were bent on
disrupting this weekend's elections for the federal
Parliament and the Czech and Slovak republic legislatures.
And at a Sunday rally in Cikhaj, east of Prague, a man made
an aborted dagger attack on the chairman of the Czechoslovak
People's Party.
   These incidents could dissipate what solidarity remained
from Vaclav Havel's peaceful revolution as the country
prepares for its first free elections in four decades. A
rending dispute over economic reforms has unsettled many
people, who see no improvements in their life styles but hear
increasingly about threatened inflation and mass
unemployment. The reform government is criticized for letting
Communists remain as industry managers and in senior
government jobs, particularly with the security police.
   Frictions resurfaced during this spring's "hyphen crisis"
over Slovakia's demand that Czechoslovakia's name be changed
to Czecho-Slovakia. A patchy compromise, allowing the Czech
and Slovak republics to call the country what they want, only
glossed over a simmering regional rivalry.
   The shift in mood is striking in a country that, after a
late start, threw off communism more completely than its
Eastern European neighbors. But Czechoslovaks are still
looking to leaders of the revolution to rekindle the fire
that brought this country of more than 15 million to its
feet. Above all, they still look to Mr. Havel, the morally
principled playwright-president, for unifying leadership.
   Thus, the bulk of the electorate appears set to vote for
Civic Forum -- the political movement of 14 small parties,
ranging from conservatives to environmentalists, that Mr.
Havel helped put together. Out of fear of and contempt for
the crippled Communist Party, Czechoslovaks seem willing to
overlook economic woes. Civic Forum is thus likely to be
awarded a chance to settle into policy making for this next
Parliament's abbreviated two-year term.
   "We are going to vote for them because they started the
revolution and took all the risks," says Jiri Podlezak, a
40-year-old Prague truck driver. His friend, Jan Pocinek,
adds: "A skilled worker will always get a job. . . . The
important thing is that the Communists don't get in."
   Pre-election polls, a novelty here, are sketchy. But of
Czechoslovakia's 23 parties, Civic Forum and its Public
Against Violence affiliate in the Slovak Republic are
expected to get 30% to 40% of the national vote. In fact, the
group expects a bigger vote when undecided voters make a
choice on election day. "The polls still support us," says
one Havel aide. "There was a certain phase of discord two
months ago, when the degree of disagreement was dangerously
high, but people settled down and sorted things out."
   One of the first acts of the newly elected Parliament will
be to choose a president. In a campaign of symbols, this
presents voters with a strong incentive for ensuring a large
Civic Forum faction in the national legislature, which would
preserve the strongest symbol of all: President Havel, who
has agreed to forgo another two years of writing if called.
   Mr. Havel has somehow remained aloof from the squabbling.
He has set the mood rather than specified the details of the
country's political and economic reforms, which are left to
the cabinet. Indeed, the president has spent the bulk of his
time traveling abroad "to repair Czechoslovakia's image after
40 years of totalitarianism," in the words of one aide.
   More in the middle of the country's policy machinery is
Prime Minister Marian Calfa, a former Communist who is
running in his native Slovakia on the Public Against Violence
ticket. Mr. Calfa says he would prefer a narrower coalition
government than the confused Consensus Cabinet he has now,
which still has two seats occupied by Communist Party
members.
   Civic Forum's likely coalition partner, Mr. Calfa says,
would be the Christian Democratic Alliance, a new
center-right group that is already the country's
second-strongest political grouping, with an estimated 13% of
the vote. Receiving financial and logistical support from
Western conservative parties -- including West Germany's
Christian Democrats -- the alliance is strongest in Slovakia.
   As in the recent elections in East Germany and Hungary,
most voters appear ready to shun anything that smacks of
leftwing ideology. Many other parties are either tainted by
past service in the National Front or are too new to allow
them to stand out from the crowd.
   "Every party here is saying the same thing -- supporting
democracy and free markets; their true political identities
won't emerge until after the elections, and that will become
a crucial phase for all of us," says Jan Skoda, vice chairman
of the Socialist Party, which is struggling to get the 5%
minimum vote required for parliamentary representation, after
failing to regain its reputation by merging with the Social
Democratic Party.
   "The people don't want to hear the name socialism -- it
gives them heartburn," says Mr. Skoda, whose party was more
of a centrist liberal party before World War II. "It seems
logical that the pendulum is swinging to the right in
Czechoslovakia, but probably not forever."
   Civic Forum's opponents are biding their time, looking
beyond this ballot to the 1992 elections. By then, they
reason, rising unemployment and fears of losing social safety
nets could revitalize support for more leftward-leaning
parties.
