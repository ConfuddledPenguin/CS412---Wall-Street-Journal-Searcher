   CHICAGO -- UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit is raising the
industry ante in the lucrative California market.
   United said it is awarding members of its frequent-flier
program triple mileage for flights between San Francisco and
Los Angeles. It said the offer is retroactive to April 7 and
will remain in effect until year end.

   It also said United frequent fliers who make 10 one-way
trips in the California corridor between April 7 and Dec. 31
will earn double mileage for non-corridor flights that
include one of several California airports.
   The action comes in the wake of stiff competition in the
California market. United is in the midst of a heated battle
with several of the country's biggest carriers for dominance
in the West Coast corridor, the busiest market of any pair of
metropolitan areas in the country, which also includes
Oakland and San Jose to the north and Burbank, Ontario, Long
Beach and Orange County to the south. In the past several
months, carriers have been beefing up flight schedules,
introducing low promotional fares and hyping service changes
in bids to gain a competitive edge.
   United called the latest move its "strongest commitment in
its history to California and the West Coast."
   A spokeswoman for American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp.,
said the carrier hasn't decided whether it will match
United's action. "We don't think it's a smart move for
American Airlines at this time," she said. USAir Group Inc.
said it is studying the move. Officials at Delta Air Lines
weren't available to comment.
