   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America said it closed its
last bauxite mines in the U.S., resulting in the layoffs or
retirements of 200 employees. The mines, in Saline County,
Ark., are adjacent to Alcoa's bauxite refinery and alumina
chemical facilities.
   The company said the mining and refining operations were
shut down because of insufficient reserves of bauxite.

   Alcoa also said it will close permanently about 275,000
metric tons annually of alumina production capacity. Alumina
is the raw material from which aluminum, and alumina
chemicals, are made. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62
pounds.
