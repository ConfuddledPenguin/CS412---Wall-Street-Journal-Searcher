   NEW YORK -- The Carter Organization, which dropped founder
Don Carter earlier this year after he admitted stealing from
clients, now has dropped his name, too.
   Carter, the pre-eminent proxy solicitor of the 1980s,
collecting shareholder votes in some of Wall Street's epic
corporate takeover battles, renamed itself Quorum
Communications. Quorum is owned by VPI Group PLC of Britain,
which bought it from Mr. Carter in 1987 for $75 million. The
Carter Valin Pollin investor relations consulting unit is
being folded in as a Quorum division.

   Quorum's chief executive officer, Dennis Mensch, said the
change "should make it clear that we are looking to the
future, rather than relying on the past, to establish our
corporate identity."
   Mr. Carter founded the firm in 1974. His sentencing, which
had been scheduled for yesterday in state court, was
postponed to July 10. He faces a maximum four-year prison
term for grand larceny involving false billing and
overcharging of corporate clients, and for tax evasion. In
London, Angus Maitland, VPI chairman, said Quorum has come
"through a very difficult period. This has tempered the
company" and allowed it to return its focus on serving
blue-chip clients.
   Mr. Mensch said Quorum has cut its staff to 77 from about
100 in early May, when the company said Arthur Ross,
president and co-chief executive, would leave in a few months
as part of a cost-cutting move. The company has been hurt by
the slowdown in corporate merger activity, but Mr. Ross has
reported "almost no client defections."
