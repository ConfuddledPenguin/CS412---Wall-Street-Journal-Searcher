   NEW YORK -- Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.C., Poland's largest
commercial bank, said it will open a branch office in New
York later this year.
   Theodore M. Sysol, an attorney for the bank, said the Park
Avenue branch will be the first full branch operation of any
Eastern bloc banking concern. A few other Eastern European
banks have representative offices in the U.S.
