   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- United Gaming Inc. said it completed
the sale of 1.2 million new shares to its chairman, Alfred
Wilms, for $10 million, bringing his stake in the company to
about 54%.
   The operator of gambling machine routes and seller of
gambling equipment said it received an opinion from an
independent investment banking firm as to the fairness of the
$8.32-a-share price, which was 90% of the average trading
price over a 20-day period.
