   LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Chairman Bernard Arnault
further consolidated his power at the French luxury group,
but also warned that the weakened yen and dollar are likely
to hold net profit growth to just 15% this year, down from
46% in 1989.
   At Moet Vuitton's annual meeting, Mr. Arnault and his
allies voted to remove four representatives of the Vuitton
family from the group's supervisory board, replacing them
with members of the Moet and Hennessy families, who are
allied with Mr. Arnault. At the end of April, Mr. Arnault won
a nearly two-year-long struggle with the Vuittons for control
of the group.

   Moet Vuitton is susceptible to yen weakness because Japan
is the group's leading market. It represents 21% of sales,
compared to France's 18% and 17% in the U.S.
   Mr. Arnault also said at the meeting that he doesn't have
any intention of further increasing Moet Vuitton's 24% stake
in British distiller Guinness PLC. Mr. Arnault just finished
boosting Moet Vuitton's Guinness stake to bring it in line
with Guinness's Moet Vuitton stake.
