   "Total Recall," the latest Arnold Schwarzenegger film, is
based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick called "We Can
Remember It for You Wholesale." The story contains an
interesting idea about the human soul: Do you have one if
your memories don't exist, or if your memories are really
somebody else's?
   But the film makers have concentrated on the expectations
Mr. Schwarzenegger arouses in his most devoted fans, the boys
and young men who have made him a superstar. So the question
of memory and identity become subordinated to the main
questions: How many times can Mr. Schwarzenegger survive
severe kicks to the groin? How many people and mutants must
be blown up before the young male appetite for comic-book
violence is sated?

   Though director Paul ("Robocop") Verhoeven bombards the
audience with groin kicking and human incineration, his
target viewers seem willing and able to accept even more than
he gives them. I saw this movie at noon on opening day in a
theater filled almost entirely with boys and young men. They
especially liked a scene in which Mr. Schwarzenegger uses an
innocent bystander on an escalator as a shield against his
pursuer's bullets. When the man had been machine-gunned to
limpness and Mr. Schwarzenegger had tossed his deflated and
bloody remains aside, the audience applauded.
   Though this scene occurs fairly early in the movie, I
already was wishing for a memory implant like the one Mr.
Schwarzenegger's character receives, one that would erase all
knowledge of "Total Recall" (except the trailer, which was
far more enjoyable than the film).
   The movie's deterioration into a pulpy bloodfest occurs
fairly rapidly and is especially disappointing because Mr.
Schwarzenegger's hulking superstructure makes him a perfect
science-fiction character. He looks like he was concocted in
a lab -- but he's no monster. Even his inability to act can
seem endearing.
   The movie opens with the promise of the camp humor Mr.
Schwarzenegger has pulled off in the past and a
science-fiction idea that touches a real nerve. There's Mr.
Schwarzenegger, wandering on the face of Mars (it's red and
rocky) with a woman. They behave as tenderly as possible
toward each other through their bulky space suits, until Mr.
Schwarzenegger falls and his suit rips and the loss of oxygen
brings him to the awful end of his nightmare.
   He wakes up to the "reality" of the future, where he lives
with his blond Barbie-doll wife, Lori. Actress Sharon Stone,
who plays her, has the same plastic sheen and a pair of the
same pneumatic-seeming muscles as Mr. Schwarzenegger. When
they embrace you expect to hear the click-click of hard
synthetic surfaces meeting. (At least the audience members
don't take the romance any more seriously than they take the
violence. They cackled when Mr. Schwarzenegger growled in his
Teutonic rat-a-tat: "Come on baby, you know you're the girl
of my dreams.")
   His name-in-the-future is Doug Quaid, and he is a
construction worker in a world Mr. Verhoeven and his
production designer, William Sandell, have conceived as a
series of underground parking lots and concrete buildings.
There are some nifty touches, especially the subway security
camera that shows passengers on its monitor as skeletons
scurrying toward the trains.
   Quaid's life is a bore (no wonder, that blank robochick
Lori]) except for his nightmares about Mars, which are
recurrent and horrible except for the athletic brunette who
stars in all of them. These fantasies give him the urge to
visit Mars, which has become a colony of earth. But he isn't
a rich man, so he makes his way instead to Rekall Inc., a
company that offers to implant fake memories into your brain.
For a fee, Quaid can think he's been to Mars. The slick
salesman offers hassle-free vacations, fantasy lives;
anything that appeals can become part of Quaid's reality.
   So far, good enough. The troubles start after Quaid's
implant doesn't take, because his memory already has been
erased, and he has to go to Mars to find out who he really
is.
   Mars is a disappointment, even technically (except for the
automated taxi driver who can take you anywhere but doesn't
recognize the command to "just drive"). Venusville, the
planet's slum where the outcasts and mutants live, looks
fake. The best the film makers could come up with is a
prostitute with three breasts (you can sense their
desperation; they trot her out for the same joke three
times).
   Now Quaid has to find out if he's Quaid, or if he's
Hauser, a government agent who turned rebel sympathizer, or
if he's Hauser, a fink. But this search for self, or selves,
gets drowned out in the blast of gunfire. The story becomes
so pinched by the action that when the screen accidentally
went dark several minutes before the climax, several people
around me wondered aloud whether the movie was over.

   VIDEO TIP: Somewhere in "To tal Recall" lurks a
condemnation of in terplanetary colonialism. The notion was
pursued far more successfully in "Outland," Peter Hyams's
1981 outer-space version of "High Noon," with Sean Connery as
an adventure hero whose memory -- and everything else -- is
intact.
