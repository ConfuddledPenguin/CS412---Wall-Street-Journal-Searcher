   TOKYO -- Motorola Inc. said the Japanese government had,
as expected, officially chosen its digital voice technology
for part of Japan's emerging digital mobile-phone standard.
   As reported, Motorola's coding technology last month
performed best in tests conducted by a division of the
Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. Seven other
companies, including Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co.,
participated in the contest.

   Motorola and government officials emphasized that the
company's technology would be used to draft part of the
standard, and that other aspects of the total standard would
be drafted by other companies as well.
   An official news conference announcing the decision is
scheduled for today.
