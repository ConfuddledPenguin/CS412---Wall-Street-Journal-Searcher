   Seagram Co.'s net income fell 4.6% in the first quarter
ended April 30, reflecting lower unremitted equity earnings
at Du Pont Co., the Wilmington, Del., chemical and energy
concern in which the Montreal-based distiller holds a 24.3%
interest.
   Unremitted equity earnings are reported in Seagram's
results, although the company doesn't get any payments.

   Net dropped to $187 million, or $1.97 a share, from $196
million, or $2 a share, a year earlier when more shares were
outstanding. The unremitted earnings, representing Seagram's
share of Du Pont's profit, fell 27% to $79 million from $108
million. Dividend income from Du Pont rose 14% to $66 million
from $58 million.
   Operating earnings rose 26% to $157 million from $125
million, while sales advanced 5.4% to $1.29 billion from
$1.23 billion. The rises reflect strength in international
wine and spirits operations, particularly at the Brazilian
affiliate, which was strong, prior to economic controls
imposed by the country's new government.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Seagram's shares fell 62.5 cents to $86.25.
