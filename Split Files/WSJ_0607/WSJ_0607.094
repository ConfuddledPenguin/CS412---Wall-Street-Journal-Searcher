   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
financial service operations topped all commercial banks in
1989 as the nation's largest holders of U.S. commercial and
industrial loans, according to a study by SMR Research Corp.
   The study showed that GM ended the year with $23.2 billion
in commercial and industrial loans, a drop of 0.4%. That
decline compared with a 60% rise in loans by Ford to $16.8
billion. Most of GM's commercial and industrial loans
financed car dealer inventories and other property. Ford's
big increase came from the acquisition last year of the
Associates Corp. finance company.

   Citicorp, the nation's largest commercial bank holding
company, came in third, according to the study with $16.3
billion of the loans. That figure represents a 4.4% decline
in the U.S., although Citicorp dominated world-wide business
lending because of the company's sizable portfolio of loans
to foreign corporations. At year end, Citicorp had $37.6
billion in commercial and industrial loans outstanding.
   Stuart A. Feldstein, SMR president, said many banks have
been large originators of business loans, but resell the
loans to other lenders.
   The SMR study found that the total domestic commercial and
industrial loan market reached $815.2 billion last year -- up
5.5% from a year earlier. Growth of the loans at banks, which
still hold about three-quarters of the market, was 4.3%.
