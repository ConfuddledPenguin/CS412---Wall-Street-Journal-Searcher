   Few people would blame Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., the
nation's fifth-largest automobile insurer, if it withdrew
quietly from several states where it persistently loses
money.
   Instead, the company has adopted the most aggressive
stance in the industry by fighting recently toughened state
laws rather than running the risk of forfeiting other
lucrative markets in those states.

   In Massachusetts, the company is challenging two state
laws that control its exit from the auto-insurance market. As
part of that effort, Aetna has hired a top constitutional
scholar from Harvard University for its legal team.
   In Pennsylvania, the company has temporarily halted its
withdrawal from the market until state regulators rule on its
rate filing later this week. In New Jersey, the big insurer
is protesting a new law that would force insurers to pay
nearly half of the $3 billion in the state's insurance pool
for high-risk drivers.
   Moreover, Aetna has stopped writing new policies in Rhode
Island, and the company's plan for withdrawal from the South
Carolina auto-insurance market has been approved by
regulators there. In late 1988, Aetna was the only company to
stop writing business in California temporarily until it
could assess the impact of Proposition 103.
   Several other insurers, such as Cigna Corp., Travelers
Corp., and Xerox Corp.'s Crum &amp; Forster unit, have decided to
cut back on their auto-insurance businesses nationwide, or
drop out entirely, and stem their losses. But Aetna's
approach is deliberately more combative.
   Aetna "is trying to make a political statement," says
Robert Hunter, head of the National Insurance Consumers
Organization. By opposing strengthened insurance regulation
in states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the company
"wants to send a message to other states."
   John J. Martin, who heads Aetna's personal insurance
division, doesn't dispute that assessment. "We aren't running
around kicking sand in people's faces just for chuckles," he
says. While Aetna isn't out to teach anyone a lesson, he
adds, "we're more aggressive about asserting our right to
manage our business."
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
comprising 50 top regulators in the country, will be looking
within the next month at the recent round of insurer threats
to pull out of the auto and other personal-insurance markets
in various states.
   Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., writes about $1.8 billion
in auto insurance premiums annually. In 1989, that segment of
the company's business generated a loss of about $53 million.
By taking a stand in several states and waging legal battles,
the company believes it's defending its constitutional
rights.
   In Massachusetts, Aetna's lawsuit challenges a state law
that requires insurers to pay an eight-year assessment to the
state's pool for high-risk drivers, who are shunned by
conventional insurers. Payment of this fee would allow Aetna
to withdraw from the Massachusetts auto insurance market but
retain its licenses to sell other kinds of insurance. The
company estimates that paying this fee for eight years would
amount to more than $200 million. Such a fee is "close to
extortion," Mr. Martin contends.
   "No one should have the right to compel a business person
to continue to invest capital in something that loses money.
This isn't like selling kids milk at student prices," says
Mr. Martin.
   The other law contested in the suit gives the state
insurance commissioner the power to revoke all of an
insurer's licenses if the company pulls out of the
car-insurance market.
   "We're unwilling to let politicians allocate our capital,"
says Mr. Martin.
   But Aetna's strategy carries some big risks. In
Massachusetts, for example, if Aetna loses its case, it could
be forced to pay the high exit fee in order to keep its other
insurance licenses or it could lose its profitable commercial
property/casualty, health and life insurance businesses in
that state.
   Laurence Tribe, the Harvard constitutional law professor
who is working with Aetna's attorneys, believes if the
Massachusetts laws are upheld by the courts, other states
might adopt similar regulation. Indeed, Pennsylvania
lawmakers will soon be debating proposed legislation that
would bar insurers who quit the auto-insurance market from
selling new policies in all other lines.
   So far, Aetna has taken its most drastic action in
Pennsylvania, where it wanted to beat a hasty retreat from
the auto-insurance market. It had losses of $15 million in
this state last year, where it writes about 10% of its total
auto business.
   Last month, the company began sending nonrenewal notices
to its 200,000 auto policyholders. Pennsylvania officials
tried to stop the company, but Aetna ignored their orders.
   Then the lawsuits started to fly. The state sued Aetna and
six other insurers who were trying to withdraw from the auto
market. Aetna countersued, trying to block the state.
   Last week, Pennsylvania and Aetna reached a temporary
truce. Aetna agreed to halt its withdrawal and rescind the
9,000 nonrenewal notices it had already sent out. It also
agreed to submit the rate filings required by a new
auto-insurance law, enacted last February, which demands rate
rollbacks.
   Meanwhile, the state agreed to review the filings quickly,
promising an answer that is due in the next few days.
However, Aetna and the state didn't drop their respective
lawsuits against each other.
   The new insurance law requires that insurers reduce
premium rates 10% for all drivers and 22% for those who limit
their right to sue in all but the most severe accidents.
   Under these provisions, Aetna's Mr. Martin claims his
company could have auto-insurance losses of some $20 million
this year in Pennsylvania alone.
   There's no guarantee that Pennsylvania will grant Aetna
the exemption from the rate rollbacks that it seeks.
Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. also agreed to stop its
withdrawal from the state, pending a review of its rate
application. However, Pennsylvania's insurance department
rejected its filing last week. The state has approved only
two exemptions from the rollbacks, disallowing eight
requests.
   Aetna's tough stance is doing more than just disrupting
life for its policyholders in several states. Unlike the four
largest auto insurance companies in the country, Aetna
doesn't have its own sales force. It works through 4,000
independent agents.
   For instance, if the company gets its way and pulls out of
the auto-insurance market in Pennsylvania, some 380 agents
stand to lose a sizable chunk of their income. Auto
insurance, often the first sale agents make to a new
customer, opens the door for future sales.
   "A number of agents feel these companies are leaving them
high and dry," says Jeff Yates, general counsel for the
Independent Insurance Agents of America, a trade group.
   Aetna's withdrawal will "severely affect us financially,"
says Barry Mohlar, whose agency near Reading, Pa., could lose
about 38% of its income if he couldn't place auto policies
with Aetna.
   For the time being, however, Mr. Mohlar and other agents
support Aetna's action because they view the laws as unfair.
"States, such as Massachusetts, have held these companies
captives," says Rick Davis, an independent agent in Needham,
Mass.
   Aetna itself recognizes the potential for harm to the
independent agents. "I don't get my kicks from disrupting
these relationships," says the company's Mr. Martin. "But we
have to draw the line some place. We can't knowingly sit
around and lose money."
