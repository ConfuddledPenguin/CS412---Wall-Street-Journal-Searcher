   It was a good day for the Democrats and for advocates of
targeted tax increases to meet urgent needs.
   In California, the Democrats nominated their most
competitive candidate for governor, Dianne Feinstein, and
wrecked a heavily financed Republican campaign to change the
rules on redistricting congressional seats in the nation's
biggest state.

   At the same time, California voters showed that the day of
"no new taxes" for any purpose is over. They demonstrated how
taxes can be increased at a time when the public is deeply
divided on the question of general tax increases by voting
narrowly to double their own state gasoline tax to 18 cents a
gallon from nine cents. The money is targeted for highway
repairs and mass transit.
   "There is still no willingness on the part of most people
to pay for what we need," says Alan Post, veteran legislative
analyst. The exception, he adds, is transportation, where a
slim majority of California voters now "are beginning to
realize something has to be done." The ballot initiative, No.
111, was passed by a margin of 52% to 48%.
   In Iowa, Democrats nominated an abortion-rights candidate
for governor who will force a showdown with an incumbent GOP
governor opposed to abortion. And in North Carolina,
Democrats chose former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, who is
black, to oppose Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in a dramatic
matchup in the fall.
   "We had one foot on a banana peel and one foot in the
grave," says Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman, "and
somehow we ended up Wednesday morning standing up and in
perfect political health."
   California, where so many political movements begin (and
sometimes end), launched the nation's tax rebellion 12 years
ago by voting for Proposition 13, putting brakes on
property-tax increases. On Tuesday, voters approved a
proposal that was backed by the Republican governor,
Democratic lawmakers and almost every professional
association in the state, and opposed by a small group of
conservatives who were unable to mount a significant media
campaign to make their case.
   "There was something in this for just about every interest
group in the state," says Austin Ranney, a political
scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. "There
wasn't any big group against it and it still only won by a
little."
   The initiative was broadly supported in the large urban
centers, where traffic congestion is so bad that Californians
fear their quality of life -- the reason that many moved to
the state in the first place -- is at risk. TV ads were
targeted to those markets, showing in detail which roads
would be improved and where new mass-transit lines would be
built. Voters in rural parts of the state voted against the
proposal.
   Although anti-tax economist Arthur Laffer says the vote
"really does end the tax revolt in California and sends a
message to Washington which I dislike intensely," another
Californian, House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
says the vote shows that new taxes win popular support only
if they are directed to specific purposes. "Deficit
reduction," the Democratic congressman said, "might not
qualify as such a tangible specific purpose."
   For Washington politicians grappling with their own budget
problems, California provided evidence that tax increases
also need bipartisan backing and broad grassroots support.
The California vote, says Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser (D., Tenn.), indicates voters will approve tax
increases when they are "absolutely necessary."
   The California vote to sharply raise the state's gasoline
tax hardly leads the way for a big federal gas-tax increase,
for example. Bush Administration officials have argued over
the last several weeks that increases in state gasoline taxes
could make it tougher to raise federal gas levies.
   The other significant political development in California
was the selection of Mrs. Feinstein, the former mayor of San
Francisco, as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Mrs.
Feinstein defeated state Attorney General John Van de Kamp,
52% to 41%, and will oppose Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson
in the fall.
   Aides to the colorless Mr. Wilson admit that the stylish
Mrs. Feinstein is a more formidable rival than Mr. Van de
Kamp. Republicans count on a huge campaign war chest to
defeat Mrs. Feinstein, who exhausted most of her cash in the
primary.
   Mrs. Feinstein surged into the lead with her opening TV
commercial, in which she underlined her support of the death
penalty. She ended the campaign with another blockbuster
criticizing Mr. Van de Kamp for his refusal, when he was
district attorney in Los Angeles, to prosecute the killer
known as the Hillside Strangler for murder. Mr. Van de Kamp
privately opposes both abortion and the death penalty, but
said he would enforce existing laws in both instances.
   Republicans had counted on California voters to approve
one or another of two ballot initiatives that would have
removed redistricting powers from the Democratic-controlled
state legislature, which in the past has been amazingly adept
at drawing boundary lines virtually guaranteeing Democratic
hegemony. But, despite a lavishly financed media campaign
featuring actor Charlton Heston, both propositions fell. If
Mrs. Feinstein is elected governor, replacing retiring
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, the GOP's situation will
be desperate. California is expected to pick up as many as
seven new congressional seats in the wake of the 1990 census.
   Mr. Heston, appearing in TV ads, urged California voters
not to allow Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to
"con" them again in painting the GOP-backed initiatives as
bad for California. Television ads opposing the initiatives
starred actor Jack Lemmon, who had appeared in ads opposing
an earlier GOP effort to change the redistricting rules.
   In another ballot proposal, California voters approved a
sweeping ethics package that bans legislators and state
officials from taking fees for making speeches or writing
articles and from earning outside income by representing
clients before government boards or agencies. It also creates
a citizens' salary commission to review and adjust the
salaries and benefits of legislators and state officials
annually without a vote being required by the legislature.
   Voters in the city of Los Angeles passed a similar ethics
package for their officials and also provided public
financing for campaigns for mayor and city council.
   Californians also supported a ballot initiative that would
stop sport hunting of mountain lions and set a floor of $30
million a year that the state must spend on wildlife-habitat
protection.
   Iowa House Speaker Don Avenson's victory in the
gubernatorial primary transforms the general election into a
heated contest over abortion. Mr. Avenson, who handily
defeated Attorney General Tom Miller and businessman John
Chrystal, will face popular two-term GOP Gov. Terry Branstad
in November. The abortion fires set during the primary are
sure to be stoked in the state during the general election by
a parallel Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who
favors abortion rights, faces a challenge from GOP Rep. Tom
Tauke, who opposes them.
   The Avenson win, moreover, was a victory for the National
Abortion Rights Action League, which faced substantial local
opposition for its decision to get involved in a heavily
contested primary and to endorse one abortion-rights
candidate, Mr. Avenson, over another, John Chrystal.
   "This may have been a risky strategy, but it was
necessary," says Kate Michelman, executive director of the
group. "We couldn't say that one guy was anti-choice and not
suggest which person would be the best to win the nomination.
Our goal was to insure that the voters in Iowa have a choice
in November, and we accomplished that."
   Meanwhile, the victory of former Charlotte Mayor Gantt in
the North Carolina senatorial runoff sets up a high-profile
November battle between the black Democrat and GOP Sen.
Helms. Mr. Gantt took 57% of the vote in a bruising primary
against District Attorney Mike Easley.
   Experts in North Carolina politics believe Mr. Gantt will
need about 40% of the white vote plus almost all of the black
vote to defeat Mr. Helms, whose financial advantage and
ability to appeal to blue-collar whites make him the
favorite. "This will be a classic confrontation," says Earl
Black, a specialist on southern politics at the University of
South Carolina. "This will be a great test of ideological and
racial differences in a major state."
