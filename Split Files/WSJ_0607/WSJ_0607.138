   ETHNIC VIOLENCE SPREAD in a Soviet republic in Central
Asia.
   With authorities in the republic of Kirghizia reportedly
helpless against rioters and gangs of marauding youths, the
official Tass news agency said at least 35 people have been
killed and about 300 injured in clashes between ethnic Uzbeks
and Kirghiz. The unrest, triggered Monday by a land dispute,
was the latest in a series of violent outbreaks challenging
Gorbachev. In Scotland, a U.S. official said Moscow had
assured Secretary of State Baker that it won't impede the
emigration of Soviet Jews despite a threat made by Gorbachev
last week.

serious treason case in West German history.

kind of strange phenomenon is occurring in various "cold
fusion" experiments.

   Medical researchers said a common treatment for chronic
back pain, called transcutaneous electrical nerve

from lower back pain, which accounts for about $16 billion in
medical costs each year.

human-rights concerns.

country.

intensive meetings among the military leadership.

weight.
