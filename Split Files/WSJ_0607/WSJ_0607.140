   Yields on money-market mutual funds slipped in the latest
week, reflecting the recent decline in short-term interest
rates, but stayed within the range of the past four months.
   The average seven-day compound yield eased to 7.96% from
7.98% in the week ended Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. Compound yields assume reinvestment of
dividends.

   Assets of the 427 taxable funds tracked by the newsletter,
which is based in Holliston, Mass., rose by $404 million to
$376 billion. It was only the second increase in the past 10
weeks.
   Average yields have been at or just below 8% since late
January, and there are no indications of any significant
change soon. The average maturity of the funds' investments
-- such instruments as commercial paper (short-term corporate
IOUs), Treasury bills and certificates of deposit --
lengthened by a day to 44 days.
   Longer maturities typically are thought to indicate that
portfolio managers think interest rates are falling, because
the funds can retain relatively higher yields for a longer
period. Conversely, short maturities are considered a sign
that managers think rates are rising. A change of a single
day usually isn't considered significant, however, and 44
days is within the range of the past few months.
   Yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction fell
and, separately, Banxquote Money Markets, a New York
information service, reported that yields on certificates of
deposit at major banks declined across the board in the
latest week.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.67% from 7.68%. The average 30-day simple yield
inched up to 7.69% from 7.68%, reflecting a slight upturn in
yields in mid-May. The average 30-day compound yield moved to
7.99% from 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free money funds fell in the latest week.
The average seven-day compound yield, for instance, fell to
5.49% from 5.54%. That's equivalent to 7.63% for an investor
in the 28% tax bracket and 8.19% for someone paying 33%.
   Assets of the 220 tax-exempt funds rose by $609 million to
$76 billion. The average maturity remained at 39 days.
