   NEW YORK -- Junk bonds continued to rally yesterday, even
as the Resolution Trust Corp. put more than $50 million of
junk bonds up for sale.
   The RTC is one of the nation's largest holders of junk
bonds, which the federal agency inherited when it seized a
number of failing savings and loan associations.

   Traders on Wall Street said the agency sent a so-called
"bid list" to brokers and institutional investors and
successfully sold the bonds at what were termed "attractive"
prices. Securities analysts estimate that the RTC holds
between $4 billion and $6 billion of junk bonds, which it
plans to liquidate slowly over time.
   Officials at RTC said it sells junk bonds frequently in
the open market, however they wouldn't elaborate about
yesterday's transaction.
   But traders said the bid list, which represented bonds
held by just one savings and loan under RTC conservatorship,
included names such as Kroger Co. and Coltec Industries.
These are some of the so-called "good junk" bonds that trade
at prices that are close to par, or full face value. Also on
the lists were some mid-quality bonds, including certain
securities issued by RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Analysts said RTC's ability to sell junk bonds without
disrupting the entire market is a sign that the market is
beginning to recover -- although modestly -- after a long
depression. Junk-bond sentiment is more positive now than it
has been in several months and prices of upper-tier and
middle-tier issues have been rising.
   Meanwhile, the number of new issues has dropped sharply,
leading to complaints of supply shortages.
   Thomas Madden, a high-yield portfolio manager at Federated
Investors Corp., said RTC tapped the market at just the right
time.
   "In the last several days, you've almost had a buying
panic in some names. Now you have one of the largest holders
of junk bonds putting some bonds up for sale." He said the
timing nearly ensured that RTC would get good prices for its
bonds.
   Peter Karches, head of the high-yield sales and trading at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., termed the RTC sale a "non-event" for
the junk bond market. He said traders and investors took the
news in stride and "prices trended higher," anyway.
   However, prices of the individual issues sold by RTC did
come under modest pressure yesterday and ended between 1/8
and 1/2 point lower.
   Most junk bond prices rose between 1/4 and 1/2 point
higher yesterday. That was a respectable advance considering
Treasury bonds ended unchanged to just 1/8 point higher.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities ended unchanged to modestly higher in
sluggish trading.
   "The bond market is hungry for some new data, but
unfortunately it's not going to get anything until next
week," said Robert Chandross, a vice president and economist
at Lloyds Bank PLC.
   Bond dealers said there was a brief flurry of selling in
early trading as investors reacted to a story in this
newspaper. The article, which cited several Federal Reserve
officials, said the policy makers appear to have no intention
of cutting short-term interest rates at this time.
   Bond prices firmed later as investors looked beyond the
present and began to speculate about possible Fed easing in
the future.
   "Market sentiment is still bullish," said Michael T.
Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. "The Fed is deemed to be on hold,
but if next week's data show inflation is behaving, then a
Fed easing would come under consideration once again," he
said. Key next week will be statistics on last month's
producer prices, consumer prices and retail sales.
   In trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/8
point, or about $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
its price, eased to 8.44%.
   The benchmark bond was quoted late yesterday at a price of
103 9/32, up from 103 5/32 on Tuesday. Shorter-term
securities were little changed.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Prices of investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to 1/8
point higher.
   Among the corporate borrowers that tapped the credit
markets Wednesday was Du Pont Co., which offered $1.85
billion (redemption amount) of zero-coupon convertible
subordinated notes.
   The notes, which mature in 20 years, were priced at
$218.55 per $1,000 note for a yield to maturity of 7.75%.
   Strong investor demand prompted underwriters at First
Boston Corp. to boost the size of the issue from an
originally planned $1.1 billion. The offering will result in
proceeds to the company of $404,317,500.
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. offered $600 million of
credit-sensitive notes through underwriters led by Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. The issue consisted of $300 million of
seven-year notes priced at par to yield 10% and $300 million
of 12-year notes priced to yield 10.109%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower after
listless trading.
   "We're just sort of status quo; the market's just pausing
here," one municipal trader said.
   In municipal market activity, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. has
assigned a SP-1 rating to an issue of $4.1 billion of New
York State tax and revenue anticipation notes.
   The notes, which constitute the state's spring borrowing,
are expected to be priced today by a Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. group.
   The SP-1 rating on the tax and revenue anticipation notes
is below the SP-1-Plus rating that S&amp;P assigned to last
year's $3.9 billion spring borrowing. The rating equals that
given to the state's sale of $775 million tax and revenue
anticipation deficit notes in March.
   Late yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. assigned a
MIG-2 rating to New York State's tax and revenue anticipation
notes. In addition, Moody's downgraded the rating on New York
State's general obligation debt to single-A from single A-1.
   Market participants had expected the rating changes, due
to the state's financial condition, its heavy debt load and
lengthy delay in adopting a budget.
   In secondary market dealings, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged, at 98
5/8 to yield 7.32%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, ended sharply
lower yesterday on speculation that several economic reports
due out soon will provide unfavorable news for the bond
market.
   Britain's benchmark 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 fell 3/4
point to 100 6/32 to yield 11.72% while the 12% issue due in
1995 was off 1/2 point at 98 27/32 to yield 12.34%.
   Prices began to fall during early trading as overseas
investors began selling gilts. British bonds also were hurt
by declines in other major bond markets and weakness in
long-term bond futures.
   Analysts said that investors anxiously await Monday's
report on May retail sales volume.
   Bond prices were lower in Japan and West Germany.

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices ended with slight
advances in sympathy with U.S. Treasurys.
   Prices in both markets were stagnant all session in the
absence of any new major economic reports.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for June delivery were up 3/32 at 99 10/32.
   In the new-issue arena, two Federal National Mortgage
Association issues were offered. Both were Remics, or real
estate mortgage investment conduits, each totaling $300.1
million.
   One was backed by Fannie Mae 9.5% securities and priced in
13 classes by Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   The other issue was priced in 11 classes by Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co. and backed by new stripped mortgage securities formed
from Fannie Mae 10.5% securities. A stripped mortgage
security is formed by separating the principal portion
interest portion of a security and selling them separately.
   With these offerings, a Fannie Mae spokeswoman said there
have been $27.402 billion of Fannie Mae Remics priced so far
in 1990. Since the inception of the securities in August
1987, Fannie Mae has issued $80.99 billion of Remics, she
said.
   As for Fannie Mae strips, the spokeswoman said $2.97
billion have been issued so far in 1990 and $22.03 billion
have been issued since their inception in February 1987.
