   Tokyo's Nikkei Index rose softly in light trading with
many participants cautious ahead of today's expiration of
June options and futures contracts.
   Meanwhile, prices in London ended moderate trading near
their intraday lows, as the market failed to muster any
strength for a late-day rally.

   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 31.88 points to
32953.50. The index slipped 3.75 points Tuesday. But
decliners yesterday outnumbered advancers 498 to 438, while
180 issues were unchanged.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index was
up 91.32 points to 33044.88.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
600 million shares, up a bit from 567.9 million on Tuesday.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section, which lost 2.31 points Tuesday, slipped 1.86 points,
or 0.08%, to 2423.07.
   The second section index rose 26.20 points, or 0.65%, to
4039.37. The index added 20.23 points Tuesday. Volume in the
section was estimated at 30.7 million shares, up from 29
million shares Tuesday.
   Because many participants are anticipating a potential
overhang of positions outstanding amid the June options and
futures contract expiration today, market atmosphere was
fairly cautious throughout yesterday, traders said.
   Limited buying in blue chips in the morning was met by
arbitrage selling and profit-taking, while early sentiment
was weak on softer bond and currency markets, traders said.
   But in the afternoon, at least one of the Big Four
Japanese securities firms was seen buying approximately 10
million shares of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, resulting in a
minor rally in shipbuilding shares, according to Masahiko
Tsuyuzaki, chief trader at Tachibana Securities Co.
   Other financial institutions later pursued large-capital
issues -- particularly steel stocks -- although rounds of
profit-taking chipped away at gains, the trader said.
   At the same time, major foreign brokerage houses bought
lightly on programs linked to the Nikkei 225 issues,
observers said.
   Speculative buying also drove up prices on selected
shares, the traders said.
   They added that a late rumor, which began after the close
of cash trading but before the futures closing, boosted
activity somewhat in futures trading.
   An announcement by Narita Airport officials that flights
from Japan to and over the Soviet Union were redirected by
flight-control authorities in Moscow sparked speculation of a
coup in the region. But Narita officials reportedly gave no
explanations, outside of citing flight-traffic problems, to
warrant such a rumor, traders said.
   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rose 30 yen to 1100 yen (20
cents to $7.21) on trading house buying, while the rest of
the sector also posted healthy gains.
   Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding rose 30 yen to 1030 yen,
Hitachi Zosen gained 10 yen to 885 yen, Kawasaki Heavy rose
12 yen to 997 yen, and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
rose 30 yen to 1200 yen.
   Auto stocks were also firmer, with Isuzu Motor rising 20
yen to 1090 yen, and Toyota adding 70 yen to 2610 yen.
   Other large-capital issues, including Kawasaki Steel, NKK
and Nippon Steel, advanced.
   On the other hand, high-technology electrical shares ended
lower after battling profit-taking.
   Sony fell 90 yen to 8560 yen, Pioneer slipped 40 yen to
6160 yen, and TDK fell 90 yen to 6610 yen.
   Meanwhile, London opened lower, and continued its downward
slide as profittakers moved in and market makers marked
prices lower. In addition, a poor showing by stock futures
reinforced stocks' downward momentum.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
21.6 points to 2358.5, after falling as many as 25.6 points.
The day's high was when the index was down 12.7 points.
   Other indexes reflected the trend. The Financial Times 30
Share Index dropped 12.9 points to 1881.
   Volume was a moderate 429 million shares, compared with
618.2 million issues Tuesday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2399, down from Tuesday's close of 2423.
   Share losses were spread across most sectors, with the
largest declines recorded by Bass, down 30 pence to #10.70
(51 cents to $18.05), Lloyds, down 12 pence to 297 pence,
Pearson, down 16 pence to 739 pence, and RMC, down 14 pence
to 691 pence.
   The few companies posting gains included Asda, up 5 pence
to 113.5 pence on unconfirmed rumors of a takeover bid. This
gain helped the sector, with Associated British Foods, up 4
pence at 409 pence, and Grand Metropolitan, up 5 pence to 642
pence.
   Rank rose 5 pence to 836 pence, while Hillsdown was up 6
pence to 265 pence, and STC gained 9 pence to 275 pence.
   Elsewhere, stocks ended lower in Amsterdam, Madrid,
Frankfurt, Milan, Zurich, Stockholm and Paris, and mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks closed marginally higher.
   In the Asian and Pacific region, shares closed higher in
Hong Kong and Singapore, and lower in Sydney, Manila,
Wellington and Taipei. Seoul was closed.
