   The battle of the big-budget summer movies is starting off
with a blast, with several films already bruised at the box
office.
   This is clearly Hollywood's most profligate summer, with
10 high-priced, high-profile movies jockeying for attention
in the next few weeks: "Die Hard II," "Days of Thunder," and
"Another 48 Hours," to name a few. With stiffer competition,
the costs of marketing movies is hitting the stratosphere.
And although opening weekends are setting records, each new
movie threatens to cannibalize what's already out there.

   Last weekend, for example, Carolco Pictures Inc.'s "Total
Recall," the violent, action-packed thriller starring
muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger, pulled in $25.5 million, the
year's biggest opening weekend. But there were victims: The
box office take for the previous weekend's big hit, "Back to
The Future Part III" from MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios, fell
a whopping 46% to $10.3 million at 2,025 screens. "Cadillac
Man" from Orion Pictures Corp. was down 46%, and Walt Disney
Co.'s "Firebirds" plunged 49%.
   Even if the big-budget movies aren't U.S. box office
blockbusters, however, the burgeoning world-wide appetite for
American movies probably will produce profits for most of
them. "People are writing off the possibility of big profits
this summer because there's so much competition" and the
films cost so much to make, says Mara Balsbaugh, an analyst
at Smith Barney Harris Upham Inc. But while costs are
soaring, she says, "the revenue side of the equation has also
become enormous, with the overall level of business expanding
everywhere."
   Increasingly, Ms. Balsbaugh notes, domestic box office
revenue accounts for only about 20% of some movie's revenues,
with post-theatrical markets such as video and television and
overseas markets bringing in the lion's share. Theaters in
France, Europe and the U.K. are being expanded and
refurbished, often by U.S. companies that also own movie
studios, such as Paramount Communications Inc. and Time
Warner Inc. Foreign television and home video markets are on
the upswing.
   Still, U.S. box office performance remains a crucial
barometer of big success in other markets. And some industry
observers worry that the box office drops last weekend may be
a harbinger of things to come. Granted, the drops were
magnified because they were being compared with the three-day
Memorial Day holiday, but they were substantial nonetheless.
   "The demise of `Back to the Future Part III' is scary,"
says Dennis McAlpine, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "You
have one big opening weekend, then the next movie comes in
and you lose your audience." If a movie can keep showing in a
number of theaters, it won't flop, but "you've got to do huge
business in that first weekend, or you're dead."
   For the next few weeks, the competition may be
particularly brutal, because many of the big-budget movies
are action/adventure films that appeal to basically the same
audience. Tomorrow, for example, Paramount opens "Another 48
Hours," a shoot-'em-up sequel to the 1982 hit starring Eddie
Murphy and Nick Nolte.
   "If `Another 48 Hours' cuts into `Total Recall,' then
`Dick Tracy' comes along and cuts into `48 Hours,' then
`Robocop' does it to `Dick Tracy,' and `Days of Thunder' does
it to `Robocop,' you could have seven or eight movies that do
$100 million but no blockbusters out of the bunch," says Mr.
McAlpine. (Not long ago, $100 million was considered a
blockbuster, but these days big hits take in $150 million to
$250 million.)
   "Week after week there are pictures opening, then another
picture is there to potentially knock it off," says Phil
Garfinkle, executive vice president of Entertainment Data
Inc. "But the overall level of business is encouraging, and
the marketplace can support more than one megahit at a time."
Last summer, he notes, while "Batman" was a huge hit,
grossing more than $250 million in the U.S., other movies
such as "Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade" and "Lethal
Weapon 2" were also huge hits.
   "Last summer, the market demonstrated that it will expand
to take in a variety of product," says Barry London, who
heads distribution and marketing at Paramount. "The question
now is how much appetite there is this summer and how much
the market can expand, and no one will know the answer to
that for the next few weeks." Mr. London and others expect
this summer to top last summer's record box office
performance.
   Studios are usually loath to disclose their production
costs, referred to as "negative costs" in the industry, or
say how much they are spending on releasing films.
   News Corp.'s Fox, for example, dismisses estimates by
analysts such as Paul Kagan Associates that "Die Hard II"
cost over $60 million to make, saying they are way too high.
But Fox won't say what the movie did cost. Studios also
dispute some of Kagan's estimates for releasing costs, which
include getting thousands of film prints to theaters and
heavy advertising.
   But clearly, studios are spending heavily on television,
print, and other advertising to get a big opening for their
movies this summer. "Prints and ads for a major summer
release can top $30 million, with over two-thirds of that
spent before the film ever opens," says Larry Gerbrandt, an
analyst for Kagan's Motion Picture Investor. He says that
such costs have risen even faster than production costs,
"sometimes approaching the cost of making the film itself."
   Carolco, for its part, says Kagan's estimates that "Total
Recall" cost $60 million or more to make are too high; the
"mid-50s" is more like it. The company also says Kagan's $27
million estimate of releasing costs is too high.
   But "Total Recall" illustrates how movie companies say
they can cover their bets even with a hugely expensive
picture. Before the movie's opening, Carolco says, it had
already taken in revenue from so-called foreign "presales" of
rights, and also received an advance payment from its own
49%-owned home video unit. In an unusual move, Capital
Cities/ABC Inc.'s network agreed to buy television rights to
the movie before its release, and Carolco has an agreement to
sell its movies to Viacom Inc.'s Showtime cable network.
   The movie is being distributed to theaters by the Tri-Star
Pictures unit of Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures
Entertainment, which gets a substantial percentage of the box
office take. But Tri-Star also pays most of the releasing and
advertising costs. "When you put all of this together, we
were in positive profit margins before the movie opened,"
says a Carolco executive. He says another benefit is that the
company gets additional funds from various markets based on
the film's box office performance.
   While most of the attention focuses on the big-budget
action films, movies offering an alternative to women,
families and others put off by too much violence may reap
rewards this summer. "I'm trying to find pictures like
`Parenthood,' `Uncle Buck,' and `Dead Poets Society' that
weren't perceived to be big hits and ended up doing
substantial business" last year, says Mr. Garfinkle of
Entertainment Data.
   Disney, for example, is opening "Betsy's Wedding," a
family picture starring Alan Alda on June 22, when Orion
opens "Robocop II." And Universal will release "Ghost Dad," a
family comedy starring Bill Cosby, on June 29, the same time
that Paramount opens "Days of Thunder," an action-packed
movie about the race-car world featuring Tom Cruise and a lot
of car wrecks.
   If the heavy competition bloodies some studios this
summer, they may rethink their strategies next year. The old
rule of thumb that movies had to be released during Christmas
or the summer to be big hits no longer applies; this spring,
a number of movies did huge business, including Paramount's
"Hunt for Red October," Disney's "Pretty Woman," and New Line
Cinema Co.'s "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," all still
pulling in moviegoers.
   "This bunching up of all the big expensive movies in the
summer may not be repeated next year, or at least not quite
so dramatically," predicts Mr. Gerbrandt of Kagan.
