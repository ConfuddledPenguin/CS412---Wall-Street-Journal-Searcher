   BASF Corp. will close the Kearny, N.J., plant at which it
produces phthalic anhydride, a raw material used in making
plastic resins, and dismiss most of the 140 employees there.
   The U.S. unit of West Germany's BASF AG will close the
facility by year end, it said in Parsippany, N.J.

   Phthalic anhydride is used to make plasticizers, in turn
used to make plastic products soft and flexible. A spokesman
said that plastics containing plasticizers are used in such
diverse items as vinyl raincoats and phone-cable insulation.
   The spokesman declined to provide revenue for the
operations being closed but said the plant hasn't been
profitable for several years. Costs of closing won't affect
earnings, he said.
   BASF will manufacture the products only in West Germany
and Spain. BASF will continue to market the phthalic
anhydride and plasticizers produced by Sterling Chemicals
Inc. of Houston at Sterling's Texas City, Texas, facilities.
   BASF Corp. makes chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics,
coatings, printing inks and other products.
