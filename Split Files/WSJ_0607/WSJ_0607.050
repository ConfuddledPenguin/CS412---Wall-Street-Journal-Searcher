   In the years after World War II, the New York Times made a
bold editorial decision. It decided that its opening pages,
usually running to at least half the first news section,
would be devoted to international news, rather than to
national news, as had been the custom. It was a bold decision
because it ran against the well-nigh editorial assumption
that Americans were more interested in reading about their
own country (or even their own locality) than about foreign
affairs. The Times's editors thought that, with the U.S. now
a world power, and one engaged moreover in defending the Free
World against messianic communism movements, international
affairs were more important than domestic developments. If
Americans didn't realize that, they should be led to realize
it, and the Times would play its part.
   I have always admired the courage and idealism behind that
decision -- except of late. As a regular reader of the Times
I now find myself skimming those pages, and even being
irritated by what I now feel to be their obtrusiveness. With
every passing month, the editorial emphasis seems more and
more off-key. I dutifully read the headlines and opening
paragraph or two, and then move on, remembering little and, I
now realize, caring less. Somehow the world has changed with
the collapse of Soviet (and Chinese) imperialism; many of the
world's problem areas seem awfully distant from the U.S. --
and no longer particularly interesting from the point of view
of American foreign policy.

   Take the following news stories, which, in any recent
week, one could find reported on at some length in the Times:
   -- In Liberia, a dissident military faction is leading a
rebellion -- apparently successful -- against the dictatorial
and corrupt government of a tyrant called Doe. The rebels are
led by a former associate of this Doe, named Taylor. No one
has any idea what these rebels stand for, and it is possible
that they don't stand for anything except replacing a Mr. Doe
with a Mr. Taylor.
   I read the accounts of this situation with a sense of
numbness. What am I supposed to feel and think? If the
Soviets (or the Chinese or even the Cubans) were involved, I
would know what to think, since we would then be confronting
a challenge. But this is a purely internal Liberian matter,
and while I am saddened by the sufferings of the Liberian
people caught up in this conflict, I see no reason why
Liberia today should even be within the purview of American
foreign policy -- or why the Times should be devoting so much
space to it.
   -- In Ethiopia, a brutal Marxist regime is being seriously
threatened by a rebellion whose leaders seem to be equally
barbaric Marxists. Again, the Ethiopian people are suffering
horribly at the hands of both combatants. But the sad truth
is that one's fund of compassion for suffering peoples all
over the world is limited. In any case, absent Soviet
involvement, Ethiopia has pretty much slipped off the
spectrum of American foreign policy, so far as I can see. We
have no national interest there, and my own interest in
reading about events there is minimal.
   -- In Cambodia, a war is being fought by a Vietnamese
puppet regime, the forces of the abominable Pol Pot (who is
supported by the Chinese), and other groups whose sole virtue
seems to be that they are not allied with the one or the
other. We are very much involved at the diplomatic level,
opposing the Vietnamese and Pol Pot, and we also send some
military aid to the "third forces," though to no apparent
effect.
   Why are we so concerned, and so involved? Cambodia, to its
misfortune, is of great interest to neighboring Communist
Vietnam and Communist China, who at the moment are using it
as a battleground. It is also of keen interest to neighboring
Thailand, a nation friendly to us, understandably
apprehensive about its neighbors, and therefore deserving of
the military aid we sent it.
   But the future of Cambodia is obviously of no serious
interest to the U.S. We have no power to shape the future of
that land, and we seek no such power. Only the Times and
State Department bureaucracy, on inertial guidance and still
taking their bearings from a global Cold War, remain
interested.
   -- In Myanmar (a.k.a. Burma), the military rulers have
allowed elections that, on paper at least, resulted in a
victory for the opposition. Not only the Times but the
American media as a whole have given this event much coverage
-- though, having read it all, I still don't know what the
"democratic" opposition stands for, or whether one can take
it seriously as a political force. Nevertheless, there is no
doubt that Burma (as I still insist on calling it) has been
terribly misgoverned in recent decades, and that a change is
welcome. It is especially welcome if the change results from
free elections.
   But having said that, what else is there to say? We have
never had any involvement with Burma, nor do we have any
reason to be involved with it today. Yes, it would be nice if
Burma evolved into a liberal democracy, Western-style. But
that is a Burmese option, not an American responsibility,
since we have no influence in that land. And if Burma evolves
in some less attractive direction? Well, we have lived with
such a Burma for some four decades now, and the American
people seem not to have experienced any trauma as a
consequence.
   There are many other examples that can be given, but they
all add up to one conclusion: With the end of the Cold War,
an era of American foreign policy has come to a close. We won
that war. "Global containment" of communism did work -- far
better, indeed, than we anticipated. Communist governments
still exist, to be sure, but the era of communist
expansionism has come to an end. So where, we have to ask,
does that leave us? What is our foreign policy now about?
   This question, alas, is not one that the State Department
seems able to focus on. The State Department, very much at
home in NATO, keeps desperately seeking new reasons for its
continued existence. It even solemnly negotiates with the
Soviets over whether a united Germany will be a member of
NATO, and whether (and how many) American and Soviet troops
might be stationed there. But if one thing is certain it is
that it is the Germans who will decide this issue, and one
can reasonably expect that, 18 months from now, the Germans
will have asked both American and Soviet troops to leave --
which they will do. Whatever else the Germans decide with
regard to NATO will be up to them, and to them alone.
   The only innovative trend in our foreign-policy thinking
at the moment derives from a relatively small group,
consisting of both liberals and conservatives, who believe
there is an "American mission" actively to promote democracy
all over the world. This is a superficially attractive idea,
but it takes only a few moments of thought to realize how
empty of substance (and how full of presumption]) it is.
   In the entire history of the U.S., we have successfully
"exported" our democratic institutions to only two nations --
Japan and Germany, after war and an occupation. We have
failed to establish a viable democracy in the Philippines, or
in Panama, or anywhere in Central America. Why should anyone
think we can do so in Eastern Europe or Southeast Asia? If
these countries are going to be functioning democracies, they
will have to achieve that goal the old-fashioned way -- by
working at it. Free elections are only the beginning.
   That leaves us with a policy vacuum. We are still a world
power and have every intention of remaining so. This means
that a traditional kind of isolationism is out of the
question. But we are now a world power that is no longer
compelled by an adversary to be interested in every part of
the globe. We are now free to pick and choose and assemble a
coherent agenda. In short, we are now free to define our
national interest, instead of having it defined for us.
   It has been so long since we have had this
intellectual-political task that we have quite forgotten how
to go about it. Reviving the idea of "national interest," and
giving it national substance, ought to be at the top of our
national agenda. It is far better that we do this job rather
than permit bloody circumstance and ad hoc responses to do
the job for us.
