   General Host Corp., New York, buoyed by reduced operating
expenses and by tax benefits, posted a sharp increase in
fiscal first-quarter net income on a 5% rise in sales.
   Net income at the lawn and garden supplies retailer almost
quadrupled to $5.5 million, or 29 cents a share, compared
with $1.5 million, or eight cents a share, a year ago. Sales
in the quarter, which ended May 20, were $166 million vs.
$158.6 million a year ago.

   As expected, the company, which operates 272 Frank's
Nursery &amp; Crafts stores, took a charge of $2.8 million, or 15
cents a share, against earnings on an equity investment.
Walter B. Rogers, director of planning, said this was more
than offset by the elimination of a $3.3 million, or 17
cents-a-share income tax reserve, which netted the company
about two cents a share in earnings.
   While overall expenses increased about $400,000, General
Host cut operating expenses by almost $8 million in the
quarter. It also lowered its interest expenses by repaying
$35 million of 12.5% senior debt and it bought back more than
$5 million of mortgage notes at a discount.
