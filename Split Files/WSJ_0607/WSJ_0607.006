   PITTSBURGH -- It's a cool, damp night at Three Rivers
Stadium, and Douglas D. Danforth sits in a heated luxury box,
a scorecard at his side. The retired Westinghouse Electric
Corp. chairman peers out at the field, where the Pirates have
runners on second and third.
   The batter lines a single to right field. Mr. Danforth
leaps to his feet and waves the runners home. "Come on] Come
on]" he yells. Pirates 6, Los Angeles Dodgers 0. "What we
gotta do is get 10 runs ahead and stay there," he exclaims.

   His enthusiasm is understandable. Mr. Danforth became the
Pirates' chairman and chief executive officer two years ago,
instilling a tough bottom-line management style that marked
his years at Westinghouse. In the process, Mr. Danforth has
found new life after retirement, turning a favorite pastime
into a vocation.
   After a bleak season in 1989, the Pirates are giving the
67-year-old Mr. Danforth plenty to cheer about. The
high-flying Pirates have been baseball's biggest surprise
this year, leading the National League Eastern division.
What's more, management believes the scrappy club can sell 2
million tickets, enough to eke out a profit.
   In many ways, Mr. Danforth has far more problems running
the Pirates than he had leading a Fortune 500 company. Among
other things, at Westinghouse he never had to worry about
sore arms, rainouts and daily news coverage. "We only had to
go public once a quarter," he says with a sly grin.
   And he confesses to some frustration. "The biggest
difference in running the Pirates is that you're absolutely
helpless in what happens out there," Mr. Danforth says,
motioning toward the field. "In business, if you have a
product with a reliability problem, you can fix it."
   Nonetheless, Mr. Danforth's friends and family say he's
having more fun than ever with the Pirates. "When people hear
he's the CEO of the Pirates, they think that's the most
wonderful thing," says his high school sweetheart and wife of
47 years, Janet. "Then he'll say he was also the CEO of
Westinghouse, and they'll say, `Oh.'"
   The Pirates' turnaround is particularly sweet for Mr.
Danforth, who five years ago played a leading role in keeping
the team in Pittsburgh. He helped put together a
public-private partnership that bought the club at a time
when many here thought the debt-ridden, last-place team,
which was hurt by a drug scandal involving a number of its
players, was a blight on the city.
   Although those problems have been solved, the Pirates'
nine local corporate owners, including USX Corp. and PNC
Financial Corp., have discovered that owning a baseball team
isn't necessarily a field of dreams. Last season, the Pirates
finished fifth and lost $1.3 million because of an
arbitration ruling that found all baseball owners guilty of
collusion in 1985 and 1986.
   That has led to rumors that the club still may leave
Pittsburgh, its home since 1887. Under the 1985 buy-out
agreement, the team could be put up for sale this year. Mr.
Danforth, however, says only a financial collapse would lead
to a sale.
   The Pirates' chairman has become something of a
mover-and-shaker in the major leagues, heading two different
committees, including one in charge of expansion. The
responsibilities have made for a travel-packed retirement.
   Mr. Danforth has always been passionate about baseball.
Growing up in Syracuse, N.Y., he took dates to minor league
baseball games. He played catcher for Syracuse University --
"I was average but aggressive" -- and his gnarled fingers
evidence his years behind the plate. When he wasn't digging
curve balls out of the dirt, he earned a degree in
engineering.
   He is known for his cool and calculating temperament --
but not with men on base. "Helluva slide]" Mr. Danforth
bellows after the Pirates' Andy Van Slyke scores on a
sacrifice fly.
   But Mr. Danforth doesn't allow emotion to cloud his
management of the Pirates. When the Dodgers bring in a relief
pitcher, Jim Gott, Mr. Danforth says: "He's the guy we dumped
last year. He's got a sore shoulder, and he wanted a
guaranteed contract. We wouldn't give it to him. We pay for
performance."
   He also demands loyalty. He fired the team's general
manager, Syd Thrift, in 1988 after the Pirates had one of
their best seasons in years. Press criticism focused on Carl
Barger, the Pirates' president, even though Mr. Danforth is
chairman. "That's the sign of a good manager," says Bernard
Mullin, the Pirates' senior vice president for business
operations.
   "You've got to work within a structure and Syd couldn't,"
Mr. Danforth says. There are worse fates than being fired,
though. Mr. Danforth breeds llamas on his farm outside
Pittsburgh. A surly creature named Freckles once took a bite
out of his owner. "We made a rug out of him," Mr. Danforth
says.
   At Westinghouse, which has diverse lines of businesses in
broadcasting, financial services and manufacturing, Mr.
Danforth was a paternalistic but demanding executive who set
clear goals, expected them to be met and knew the numbers.
   His impatience with mistakes of any kind is clearly
evident at the baseball game. In the seventh inning, the
Dodgers mount a rally when the Pirates' left fielder boots a
line drive and a run scores. "Oh my God, that was a bad
play," grumbles Mr. Danforth, sipping a beer. "He didn't get
in front of the ball. A bad play."
   Moments later, another run scores when the pitcher drops
the ball covering first base. "Dammit]" Mr. Danforth yells.
Pirates 7, Dodgers 5.
   For the Pirates, Mr. Danforth establishes budgetary
guidelines and meets each year with department heads.
Although he isn't directly involved with player negotiations
and trades, he is consulted on virtually all moves that
affect the bottom line.
   The Pirates have about $38 million in annual revenue,
pocket change compared with Westinghouse's $12.8 billion. But
Mr. Danforth says the two organizations share at least one
attribute. "Marketing's the key, whether it's baseball or
lighting systems," he says.
   Playing in a mid-sized market, the Pirates will never have
the television revenue of teams in larger cities, although
the team must pay competitive salaries with clubs in New York
and Los Angeles.
   Then there's the rain; bad weather has kept attendance low
this season. "The weather has absolutely killed us this
year," Mr. Danforth sighs.
   The Dodgers don't, though. The game ends on a double play.
Pirates 9, Dodgers 5. "We had it all the way," Mr. Danforth
says.
