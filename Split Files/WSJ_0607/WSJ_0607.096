   World oil prices continued to recover from the week's
earlier losses despite uncertainties over OPEC output and
bearish figures on U.S. petroleum inventories.
   Although Brent blend crudes traded on the International
Petroleum Exchange in London were down as much as 15 cents a
barrel, prices of fuels and crude oil were generally stronger
in both spot and futures markets in Europe and the U.S.

   In U.S. futures trading, prices were higher across the
energy complex. The July crude contract on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose 24 cents a barrel to settle at
$16.92, near the $17 level that many traders consider to be
technically important. The August crude contract settled 18
cents higher at $17.57.
   These gains were hardly enough to offset the sharp drops
of Monday and Tuesday or the erosion of nearly $7 a barrel
that has taken place since the year's prices peaked in
January. But to a few traders they suggested a possible
turnaround in oil markets.
   "They probably signaled that the market has bottomed out,"
said Neil Chandi, president of Crescent International
Petroleum Ltd.
   But oil prices still are subject to the course of
production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. "All really depends on what happens between now
and mid-June," said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based
consultant on OPEC affairs.
   Mr. Karbassioun estimated that OPEC output dropped 300,000
to 400,000 barrels a day in May from the April level. He
looks for a similar decline this month based on preliminary
estimates.
   That would suggest OPEC output for June of around 23
million to 23.2 million barrels a day. That would be down
nearly one million barrels a day from the peak production of
24 million barrels a day earlier this year. Although OPEC
agreed in early May to curb quota cheating and reduce
production by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day, several oil
ministers conceded they expected cuts totaling one million
but that amount should be sufficient to satisfy jittery oil
markets.
   But will it be enough to satisfy Saudi Arabia? The kingdom
has insisted it will continue to adhere to its quota of 5.4
million barrels a day. But Saudis are known to be impatient
with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, chronic
overproducers. Unless these two reduce output, the Saudis
aren't likely to continue producing within their quota much
beyond the late-July date of the next OPEC meeting.
   At the opening of futures trading yesterday, oil prices
appeared to be continuing to plunge because of large
increases in crude oil and fuel inventories reported late
Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute. The July crude
contract hit a low of $16.33 a barrel before turning up.
   A late Tuesday statement by the Saudi oil minister, Hisham
Nazer, that the kingdom would continue respecting its quota
as promised was a contributing factor in yesterday's rally.
Also helping firm prices were rumors that a large cloud in
the Soviet Union was radioactive, but the reports have been
discounted.
   Also, there were rumors that an emergency meeting of OPEC
would be called to deal with the price and production
problems. But a senior OPEC official said: "I've heard the
rumors, but I'm not aware of any such meeting."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: The price of soybean futures
contracts rose on an early buying flurry because of rumors
that a potentially radioactive cloud was passing over the
Soviet Union, but declined late in the trading day as news
reports played down the reports. The price of the July
soybean contract rose 1.25 cents overall to settle at $5.94 a
bushel. Though weather became warm and dry throughout the
Midwest, it wasn't enough to offset the unusually wet spring;
so favorable planting and growing conditions yesterday had
little impact on grain futures prices, analysts said.
However, any radiation problem likely to damage Soviet food
production capability and force the Soviets to buy U.S.
grain, as in the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, would drive
grain futures prices up, said Steve Freed, senior grain
analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The mysterious Soviet
cloud continued to drift toward northern Finland last night
and was to be tested for radiation by Finnish authorities.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell back from Tuesday's
gains. August delivery gold was off $2.60 an ounce to
$361.00. July silver declined 3.3 cents an ounce to $5.0630.
July platinum eased $2.90 an ounce to $489.40. A stronger
dollar triggered selling of precious metals futures, an
analyst said. Also a factor, he said, were news reports of a
large cloud over the Soviet Union, which was first thought to
be caused by a nuclear explosion. The possibility of a
nuclear problem caused selling of precious metals futures on
the belief that if the Soviet Union has more difficulties to
contend with it might have to sell more gold, the analyst
said, although he conceded that scenario was stretching
things a bit. "Actually, what it shows is the susceptibility
of the market to even the thought that producer selling might
take place," he said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Most futures contracts rose to new
life-of-contract highs and retained a part of their gains.
But the July 1990 contract, which represents the current
1989-90 crop, hit a new high and then declined to end with a
net loss of 0.24 cent a pound at 81.10 cents. Demand for
contracts early in the day was stimulated by a
smaller-than-expected crop report on cotton plantings in
China, the world's top cotton producer, Thomas Mueller,
analyst for Merrill Lynch, said. He noted that Chinese
plantings were placed at around 13.2 million acres, about
650,000 acres below industry expectations. However, Mr.
Mueller said: "I don't think the reported figure includes
cotton planted during the summer, which would add another
450,000 acres to the total. I think the actual planted
acreage will be closer to 13.7 million acres."
