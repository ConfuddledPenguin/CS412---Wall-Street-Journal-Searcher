   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. said it intends to sell three
businesses as part of a previously announced plan to fund
asbestos litigation liability.
   The businesses to be divested -- its Trim, Orcomatic and
Injection Molding divisions -- make a variety of molded
rubber and trim parts for the automotive industry. They
accounted for less than 5% of Eagle-Picher's $729.9 million
in sales for the year ended Nov. 30, 1989, a company
spokesman said.

   Eagle-Picher, Cincinnati, is a defendant in about 60,000
separate lawsuits stemming from its manufacture, from 1934
until 1971, of an asbestos-containing insulating cement used
principally in shipbuilding and refinery construction. The
company said it has already paid nearly $500 million in
asbestos claims, and expects to pay at least that amount to
resolve current and future litigation.
   At the end of its fiscal first quarter, ended Feb. 28,
Eagle-Picher had an underfunded reserve of $462 million for
such litigation. Proceeds from the sale of the three
designated divisions will be used to fund that reserve.
