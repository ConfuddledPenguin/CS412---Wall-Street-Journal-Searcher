   Dear Dr. Sullivan,
   I'm sorry to bother you with two letters in six weeks, but
I have a couple more things on my mind.
   First, though, thanks for sending me a copy of your
graduation speech at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa. It
was a fine speech. George Washington Carver, that onetime
Simpson student, is revered on campus, so using his life as
the basis for your speech was smart. And the message that you
took from that -- "You must assume responsibility for the
life you lead" -- was a good one for those young Iowans.
   Thanks, too, for telling the students that even if they
leave Iowa "you must never let Iowa leave you." I hope they
listened to both your messages.
   Young people are a great resource for this nation, which
brings me to my reason for this letter. I read your recent
testimony to the Senate Finance Committee in which you urged
states to ban cigarette-vending machines as a way to stop
youngsters from taking up smoking, and I think you're on to a
terrific idea. Your proposal for licensing tobacco dealers
and then enforcing the ban on sales of cigarettes to minors
also is a good one.
   Tobacco is after all a drug, a drug that kills, so it
makes sense to begin treating it like one. The warnings on
the package have helped, and the constant campaign against
smoking waged first by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and
now by you has helped even more, if you read the statistics
on the decline in smoking the way I do.
   Smoking clearly is a terrible problem for youth and adults
alike. The Journal of the American Medical Association
reported the other day that each year three million Americans
under 18 consume almost one billion packs of cigarettes and
26 million containers of snuff. The profits from these sales
-- illegal in 44 states -- total more than $200 million a
year, the Journal reported.
   You talk about how smoking kills 1,000 Americans a day, a
fact that Robert Sack, a lawyer in New York (for this
newspaper, among others), put strikingly the other day in a
speech in Oregon. Every two months, he said "more Americans
are killed by tobacco smoke than were killed in the entire
Vietnam War. It would take six monuments the size of the
Vietnam War Memorial in Washington to accommodate the
engraved names of tobacco victims during a single year."
   Since the average age that people begin smoking is 13,
"the addiction that fosters tobacco use can be considered a
childhood disease," the Journal of the American Medical
Association says. Thus, Mr. Sack's monuments are, in a way,
monuments to children, which is all the sadder.
   Making cigarettes difficult to buy, as you propose, is one
way to cut down on teen-agers' smoking. But there is another
way, the way that Dr. Koop and you have discovered: Keep
talking about it. The way to fight bad ideas is through
speech, exposing an idea as dumb or substituting a better
idea. You and Dr. Koop have been saying that smoking is dumb,
lethally dumb, for years now, and it is working.
   I have an idea that will expand on that. I proposed it
before in these pages, and I assume that since it wasn't
immediately embraced by you and your colleagues and proposed
as law that somehow you missed it. So I'd like to propose it
again.
   In the late 1960s, courts ruled that television stations
had to run one anti-smoking advertisement for every four
cigarette commercials they ran. Cigarette consumption
dropped, and that's probably the main reason cigarette
companies didn't complain when courts later banned all
cigarette advertising from the airwaves. For the free
anti-smoking commercials disappeared then, too, and the
companies merely switched their advertising to media whose
advertising policies were beyond the reach of the courts.
When the anti-smoking ads disappeared, smoking started rising
again. It kept going up until Dr. Koop took up the cause.
   So this is my proposal: Have the government produce
anti-smoking ads and buy time to broadcast them, plaster them
on billboards, and print them in big and mighty newspapers.
Raise taxes to finance this. A two-cents-a-pack tax would
yield more than $600 million a year, far less than the $2.5
billion the companies spend annually to promote their 250
brands, but enough to get across the message that smoking
kills. California has recently launched a scheme like this,
and I'll bet it works.
   The beauty of this idea, like the beauty of your idea
about vending machines, is that it doesn't stifle speech. It
furthers it. Banning advertising of cigarettes, as more and
more people are proposing, is a frightening remedy, for it
censors us, it muzzles us, it takes away that dear right of
free speech. As long as cigarettes are legal, the folks at
Philip Morris should be able to pitch the joys (whatever they
are) of smoking just as freely as you and I talk of the
evils.
   As Mr. Sack said in that Oregon speech, "when debate is
full, right is most likely to triumph. When speech is
throttled, issues are buried and only the status quo can
prevail."
   I have another idea, too. I just read a report pointing
out that insurance companies, college endowments and state
retirement funds own some $2.5 billion of tobacco stocks.
Tobacco stocks might be a good investment, but there seem to
be some ironies here: insurance companies investing in a
product that shortens lives, colleges investing in a product
that will kill off some of their best and brightest graduates
in the prime of their careers, states investing in a product
that will deprive many pensioners of long and happy
retirements.
   Since that report was issued, a new group, the Tobacco
Divestment Project, has sprung up, and it already has
persuaded the City University of New York to unload its
tobacco holdings. Harvard, too, is getting rid of its tobacco
stocks.
   Might it not be a good idea, Dr. Sullivan, to start
talking about this a lot, the way you talk about the evils of
smoking, so that maybe some other big investors will
reconsider their positions? Who knows -- if teen-agers have a
hard time finding cigarettes, if Americans in general are
bombarded with messages about the ills of smoking, and if
investors start pondering the wisdom of certain investments,
maybe the number of smokers will drop dramatically.
   Meantime, I hope you'll keep repeating what you told those
Simpson students about George Washington Carver's views on
smoking: "If God had intended the human nose to be used as a
chimney, He would have turned our nostrils up."
   I suspect that might be the line those youngsters will
remember from that fine speech you gave.
   But don't worry. That's one line more than most students
remember from most graduation speeches.
   Best wishes, Michael Gartner
