   MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican government is almost set to
begin the largest privatization in Latin American history:
the sale of its 54% stake in the telephone monopoly,
Telefonos de Mexico S.A., which analysts say could fetch from
$4 billion to $6 billion.
   The privatization will occur in two stages, beginning in a
few weeks with a call for bids from prospective operating
groups, according to Jacques Rogozinski, the Mexican finance
ministry official overseeing the sale. Analysts say Mexico is
looking for a consortium that includes Mexican investors and
at least one foreign telephone operating company, with
Mexicans required by law to have majority control. Mexico has
retained Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. to aid in the selection of the
operating group.

   After selling a stake directly to the operating
consortium, the government will unload the remainder of its
Telmex shares later this year, either through a public
offering on Mexican and foreign stock markets or through a
debt-for-equity swap. "We're hearing different proposals,"
says Mr. Rogozinski.
   Mexican officials and U.S. analysts see a potential
problem for some prospective American buyers: The consent
decree that broke up the Bell System restricts the seven
independent Bell holding companies from offering long
distance service within the U.S. outside each company's
particular region. Thus, some telecommunications lawyers say,
a Bell company that bought into Telmex would violate the
decree, because Telmex carries long-distance traffic between
Mexico and all regions of the U.S.
   A spokesman for Denver-based U S West Inc. said its
lawyers concluded that a Bell company and its partners "would
have to structure a deal so that any revenue for calls to and
from the U.S. wouldn't be a part of any interest the Bell
company had." Or, analysts say, a Bell company interested in
Telmex could seek a waiver from the court administering the
Bell breakup. Lawyers say the consent decree wouldn't
prohibit a Bell company from participating in long-distance
service within Mexico or between Mexico and any country other
than the U.S.
   In any case, the decree is definitely weighing on the mind
of Mr. Rogozinski: "Supposedly, it limits and creates lots of
problems for the Bells," he says.
   Other analysts are more concerned about the fact that a
slew of governments, from Puerto Rico to New Zealand, have
either privatized telephone companies or are talking about
it. "Mexico has a lot of competition," for investment
dollars, says Frank Governali, a telecommunications analyst
at First Boston Corp.
   Mr. Rogozinski argues that Telmex presents unmatched
opportunities. Mexico has fewer than 10 telephones for every
100 inhabitants, one of the lowest ratios in the world. The
probability of a free-trade agreement between Mexico and the
U.S., he says, portends a boom in demand. "It's a very good
investment and the markets are showing that," he adds.
Telmex's American depositary receipts are trading at $1.25,
up from this year's low of 87 cents. And recently Telmex has
accounted for a huge 20% of the volume of the booming Mexican
stock market.
   The government has spent recent months sprucing up the
company's operations and balance sheet. It has revamped the
tariff structure to reduce subsidies, overhauled inefficient
subcontracting procedures, eliminated some union perquisites,
and reduced the company's debt. Analysts had projected that
Telemex might have net income of $1 billion in 1990. "It
seems like we're going to go over that a little bit," says
Mr. Rogozinski.
   The list of rumored buyers is lengthy. Mexican officials
note that GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., doesn't face the same
restrictions that the regional Bells do. A GTE spokesman said
that it "views with interest all privatization activity
occurring in the world." Cable &amp; Wireless PLC of London,
another rumored Telmex buyer, said "it's a natural that we
should look at" Telmex.
   Within Mexico, potential buyers include the investment
houses Acciones y Valores de Mexico S.A. and Casa de Bolsa
Inverlat S.A., and the Monterrey-based conglomerate Grupo
Alfa S.A. The investment houses wouldn't comment. A spokesman
for Alfa said it was making a preliminary analysis of how
Telmex might fit into the company's operations.
   To make the sale a smaller bite for the operating group,
the government is contemplating a change in the capital
structure of Telmex. Mr. Rogozinski said the company might
issue a new class of shares with limited voting rights. The
operating group then would be required to acquire 51% of only
the full-voting shares to obtain control. Foreigners would be
allowed to buy as much as one-quarter of the 51% full-voting
shares.
   Mr. Rogozinski said the government has almost completed
drafting the operating concession, which would run for 30
years and could be extended for 20 years. Major features
include:
   -- Domestic and international long-distance, currently the
most lucrative part of the company, would be opened to
competition in 1994. That would give the new operator time to
phase out the subsidy in local service.
   --The operating group would be able to create regional
affiliates, similar to the regional Bells. "If they want to
subsidiarize, to make it regional, they'll be able to do lots
of different things," says Mr. Rogozinski. For instance,
"they can create a regional in Monterrey and get a partner
there, but they cannot sell to {the partner} because all the
shares are going to be frozen" for five years after the
privatization.
   -- The operating consortium must undertake an expansion
program ensuring annual growth in lines of 12%.
