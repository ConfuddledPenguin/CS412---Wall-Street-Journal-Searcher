   A mountain near Tucson, Ariz., has become the latest
battleground in the war between environmentalists and
developers. Opponents of a proposed $200 million observatory
on Mount Graham claim that its construction threatens the
existence of the Mount Graham red squirrel, which lives only
at the summit of this mountain. The diminutive squirrels,
totaling slightly more than 100 in number, were listed as
endangered in 1987 under the Endangered Species Act. They are
being used in an attempt to halt this project, just as the
snail darter, the northern spotted owl, and the dusky seaside
sparrow have been used to interfere with previous
construction or resource-use decisions.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan recently questioned
whether the interference on behalf of a single species is
worth the cost, and suggested that Congress consider
increasing the flexibility of the Endangered Species Act. His
remarks, which included the statement, "Nobody's told me the
difference between a red squirrel, a black one or a brown
one," may not earn high marks from environmental groups. But
they make considerable sense to much of the scientific
community.

   The view that the loss of a single species can have
disastrous consequences represents a misguided notion about
the significance of individual animal or plant categories.
The Endangered Species Act assumes that preserving one
species has enormous value or benefit. But this assumption is
not warranted.
   Suppose we lost a species. How devastating would that be?
"Mass extinctions have been recorded since the dawn of
paleontology," writes Harvard paleontologist Stephen Gould.
These evolutionary disruptions delineated the major
boundaries of geologic time. The most severe of these
occurred approximately 250 million years ago, at the end of
the Permian Period, with an estimated 96% extinction of
species, says Mr. Gould. The cause of these extinctions is
uncertain, but possibilities include global cooling,
radiation and sea-level fluctuations. There is general
agreement among scientists that today's species represent a
small proportion of all those that have ever existed --
probably less than 1%. This means that more than 99% of all
species ever living have become extinct.
   Yet, in spite of these extinctions, both Mr. Gould and
University of Chicago paleontologist Jack Sepkoski say that
the actual number of living species has probably increased
over time. The "niches" created by extinctions provide an
opportunity for a vigorous development of new species, a
process called speciation. Periods of mass extinctions have
been followed by increases in the number of species, as when
small mammals expanded rapidly after dinosaurs disappeared.
   Thus, evolutionary history appears to have been
characterized by millions of species extinctions and
subsequent increases in species numbers. Indeed, by
attempting to preserve species living on the brink of
extinction, we may be wasting time, effort and money on
animals that will disappear over time regardless of our
efforts.
   Advocates of preservation often contend that the process
of evolution has endowed each species with a genetic
accumulation of characteristics that enhance its chances of
survival. If a species becomes extinct, this genetic history
disappears forever and cannot be passed along to future
species. The loss of any single species detracts from the
genetic pool, this argument goes, and reduces the range of
possibilities for future adaptation.
   But Mr. Gould challenges this view. In his book "Wonderful
Life" he writes that traits that enhance survival "do so in
ways that are incidental and unrelated to the causes of their
evolution in the first place. . . . A trait with no previous
significance, one that had just hitchhiked along for the
developmental ride as a side consequence of another
adaptation, may now hold the key to your survival."
   In other words, traits that have helped a species survive
in the past are not particularly important to the future
survival of that species or to its offshoots. The evolved
survival traits of an endangered species are no more valuable
than the traits of the new species that will eventually
evolve after its extinction. Preserving a species will not
necessarily increase the survival chances of future
generations.
   Why, then, are environmentalists so concerned with strict
enforcement of the Endangered Species Act? The answer is that
saving species is often a subterfuge for achieving other
goals, such as the prevention of development. When the Sierra
Club's Legal Defense Fund attempted to delay a federal sale
of old-growth timber in the Pacific Northwest, Andy Stahl,
one of its analysts, made this fact quite clear. He called
the northern spotted owl "the wildlife species of choice to
act as a surrogate for old-growth protection, and I've often
thought that thank goodness the spotted owl evolved in the
Northwest, for if it hadn't we'd have to genetically engineer
it . . . we can use it to protect a lot of old-growth."
Evidently, Mr. Stahl is more concerned with old-growth timber
than with the spotted owl.
   Opinion is divided on whether the Mount Graham red
squirrel will actually become extinct if the observatory is
built; some say that the squirrel will have no trouble
existing in the thousands of acres of nearby coniferous
forests. But even if we lose this small population, we can
rest assured that the consequence will not be evolutionary
Armageddon. Whether the telescope should be built is a
question to be decided by careful weighing of costs and
benefits by the owners and developers. They should consider
the potential loss of the squirrel as a possible cost, but
not measure it as a disaster.
