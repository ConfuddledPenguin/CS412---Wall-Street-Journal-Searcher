   MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Kinder-Care Learning Centers Inc. said
it named J. Phillip Samper, the former vice chairman of
Eastman Kodak Co., as president and chief executive officer
of the big child-care company.
   Mr. Samper, 55 years old, is a 28-year Kodak veteran. He
had overseen Kodak's photographic products business, but
decided to retire at the end of last year following Kodak's
appointment of Kay R. Whitmore as chairman and chief
executive officer. Mr. Samper, who had spent much of his
career building Kodak's international business, was Mr.
Whitmore's chief rival for the top jobs at Kodak.

   Mr. Samper succeeds Tull Gearreald, who has served as
interim president and chief executive officer of Kinder-Care
Learning Centers since February. Mr. Gearreald will remain a
director of the company and a partner in Lodestar Group, a
New York investment banking company that holds about 63% of
Kinder-Care Learning Centers.
   In addition to Mr. Samper, the company added six other
directors to its board, as Lodestar continues to strengthen
its control over the company. The new directors are: Herbert
Baum, president of Campbell North America; Jack Greenberg,
senior executive vice president and chief financial officer,
McDonald's Corp.; Malcom Hopkins, former vice chairman and
chief financial officer, St. Regis Corp.; Geraldine
Laybourne, president of Nickelodeon; Dr. Sandra Scarr, a
University of Virginia psychology professor; and Wayne
Thornbrough, chief investment officer of Lodestar.
   The appointments, six of which were to fill vacancies,
expand the board to 12 members.
   Late last year, Lodestar sought to acquire the 37% of
Kinder-Care that it didn't already own, but the company
rejected the Lodestar proposal.
