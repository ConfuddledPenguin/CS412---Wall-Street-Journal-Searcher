   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange, taking another
step toward 24-hour trading of stocks, approved a limited
form of "off-hours" trading for big investors that could
start later this year.
   The Big Board approved two after-hours trading sessions --
known as "crossing sessions I and II" -- that will permit big
investors to trade major stocks through a computer for about
an hour after the regular trading session ends at 4 p.m. EST.

   However, true 24-hour trading -- the final phase of the
exchange's off-hours trading plan -- is still several years
down the road, exchange officials say. And many market
experts question whether round-the-clock trading of stocks is
something that many investors want.
   The Big Board also approved another service for big
institutional investors, starting as early as 1991. This one
will let them trade certain privately placed, unregistered
stocks and bonds that can now be more easily traded under the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144a. The new
system would compete with the National Association of
Securities Dealers' Portal system, which has been running for
several months.
   The American Stock Exchange also is developing a 144a
system, called Situs, to compete with Portal and whatever
system the Big Board might introduce.
   The exchange's efforts in both off-hours and unregistered
trading reflect the direction in which the nation's
securities markets are headed -- toward increasing services
for big institutional investors such as pension and mutual
funds.
   The Big Board has seen the big investors direct more and
more of their trading business to off-exchange markets and to
regional and overseas exchanges. It has been scrambling to
protect its market share. Richard Grasso, Big Board
president, said the off-hours trading plan is, in part, an
attempt to "position the exchange competitively in the
evolution of a 24-hour marketplace."
   The exchange hopes the SEC will be quick to approve its
efforts in off-hours trading as a way of cutting down on the
growing trading of U.S. stocks in overseas markets, where
disclosure requirements can be much looser. Many big
investors, including brokerage firms doing computer-aided
program trading, have been using overseas markets such as
London's because they enjoy the relative anonymity there.
   The two "crossing sessions" that the Big Board approved
may be up and running before year end, an exchange spokesman
said. Neither session involves the physical presence of Big
Board floor traders, or specialists. They are assigned to
make markets in individual stocks on the exchange floor, as
part of a system that has been the heart of the exchange
since its founding nearly 200 years ago.
   Instead, in the first crossing session, from 4:15 p.m. to
5 p.m., traders will be able to execute orders in Big
Board-listed stocks using the 4 p.m. closing price. At 5
p.m., exchange computers will match buy orders with sell
orders and execute the trades.
   The second session is designed for brokerage firms
executing program trades for customers. From 4:15 p.m. to
5:15 p.m., exchange computers will execute multistock trades
in stocks in Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, the index
commonly used in program trading strategies.
   An earlier attempt by the Big Board to capture more
trading volume failed. That was the Big Board's Exchange
Stock Portfolio product, which allowed big investors to trade
all the S&amp;P 500 stocks in a single basket trade during
regular trading hours. The product has attracted virtually no
trades in recent months.
   If the crossing sessions catch on, the Big Board in 1991
hopes to begin "auction pricing" sessions, in which all Big
Board-listed stocks could be traded after hours, either by
computer or by floor traders. There wouldn't be continuous
trading; instead, orders would likely be entered, matched and
executed periodically at whatever prices the market dictates.
Finally, if customers want it, the Big Board might pursue the
final phase of the off-hours experiment: 24-hour trading.
   The Big Board said that, as part of its off-hours efforts,
it also approved a series of new rules referring to order
entry and execution, which the SEC must clear.
