   NEW YORK -- Uncertainty about the future of interest rates
and trepidations about the banking industry prompted
investors to demand unusually high yields from the nation's
second-largest banking concern.
   Chase Manhattan Corp., the parent of Chase Manhattan Bank,
was forced to reset the rate on $200 million of auction-rate
subordinated notes to yield 13.017%, up from the previous
rate of 9.66%.

   The new yield was 4.92 percentage points higher than the
yield on two-year Treasury notes and just shy of the maximum
permissible spread of five percentage points above two-year
Treasurys.
   "Most people were pretty shocked" by the rate, said one
corporate bond trader who had expected the notes to be reset
at a spread of between 2.5 to three percentage points above
the two-year Treasury note. When the Chase notes were last
reset in 1988, they were priced to yield 1.05 percentage
points more than two-year Treasury notes.
   But times have clearly changed for the banking industry.
Spreads between yields on Treasurys and on securities issued
by financial corporations have been widening for months as
concerns about rising loan losses and fears of an economic
recession prompted credit rating agencies to downgrade
banking securities. That, in turn, prompted investors to dump
the securities, sending prices spiraling lower.
   Chase Manhattan has a credit rating that is on the
borderline of investment grade. If the bank's debt is
downgraded another notch, it would be rated on the same level
as a top-tier junk bond.
   In addition to concerns about the industry, analysts said
some investors demanded a premium because they are worried
that Chase may be unable to successfully reset the notes
again in 1992. However, syndicate officials said, investors
demanded premiums because they are concerned that Chase may
retire the debt in 1992.
   In any case, many analysts seem to feel that the rates
were priced at exaggerated levels which reflected investor
hysteria rather than market fundamenatals.
   "In a historical perspective, these spreads seem
ridiculous," said Jay Weintraub, a banking analysts at
Salomon Brothers Inc. The firm was a member of the syndicate
that managed the reset auction. "There is a lot of negative
psychology about the banking industry. But the fundamentals
are not nearly as bad as the psychology would tell you."
   Officials at Chase Manhattan said the high yields reflect
poor market conditions along with increasing competition for
limited funds with foreign banks which recently began
flooding the global bond market with subordinated debt.
   In July, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. issued a total of $1 billion
in subordinated debt in the U.S. and Europe. Last week, three
other Japanese banks, Fuji Bank Ltd., Nippon Credit Banks
Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo Ltd., issued a total of $1.8 billion
of subordinated debt in the Eurobond market. Some analysts
argue that the aggressive debt issuance of Japanese banks,
which have strong credit ratings, may crowd banks with lesser
ratings out of the market.
   Last month, underwriters at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. were
forced to pull a $100 million issue of Continental Bank
10-year subordinated capital notes due to poor market
conditions.
   Although Chase could have called its $200 million issue of
subordinated auction rate notes, corporate bond traders said
that since it is so difficult for banks to raise subordinated
debt financing today, that wasn't a viable option.
   In a sign of how difficult the commercial paper market has
become, Citicorp yesterday said it would discontinue its
weekly $100-million commercial paper auction after next
Tuesday's sale.
   A bank spokesman said Citicorp intends to continue selling
commercial paper through direct placement, which he said
offers the bank more flexibility in setting maturities.
Commercial paper accounts for less than 1% of Citicorp's
overall funding.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities inched higher in choppy, aimless
trading as investors gave up hopes for lower interest rates
but saw a glimmer of hope for a quick deficit-reduction plan
late in the day.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 98 2/32, up
nearly 3/8 points from 97 23/32 on Monday. The issue's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to
8.92% from 8.96% on Monday. Two year notes ended at 100 5/32,
up 2/32 to yield 8.02%.
   The recent disappointment that a bipartisan deal to trim
the government's budget shortfalls had not been forthcoming
weighed heavily on fixed-income investors. But prices rose
late in the session following reports that Congressional
negotiators were trying to finalize a broad budget outline in
time for President Bush's address to Congress yesterday
night.
   But sapping investor interest for much of the day was the
spreading perception that the Federal Reserve is not prepared
to change its monetary policy despite clear signs of economic
weakening. As recently as Monday, the anticipation of an
imminent Fed easing was boosting shorter-term securities,
which are particularly sensitive to any change in Fed policy.
   Short-term rates ended little changed. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills was slightly lower at 7.40% for
a bond equivalent yield of 7.63% while the rate on six-month
bills was unchanged at 7.34% to yield 7.71%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The Resolution Trust Corp.'s sale of $70 million of
high-yield bonds depressed prices of some junk bonds but
barely bristled the broader market.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended about 1/8
point lower.
   The junk bonds of GNS Finance Corp. lost even more. GNS's
12% guaranteed notes sold on behalf of Golden Nugget, was
reportedly among the names on the RTC's bid lists Tuesday.
The notes fell 1 1/2 points to end at 89.
   Some analysts said the GNS bonds also were adversely
affected by efforts on the part of underwriters at Salomon
Brothers Inc. to market a new $100 million Golden Nugget junk
bond issue.
   Among the issues reportedly on the RTC's bid list were
bonds from Eastern Airlines, Penn Traffic Co., Telemundo
Group Inc., and GACC Holding Co.
   The RTC is expected to sell another $40 million in junk
bonds, posssibly as early as today. Market sources said among
the names included on the new bid list are Coltec Industries,
Century Communications Co. and American Cablesystems.
   Meanwhile, the Australian government announced that it
would repurchase about $515 million of its outstanding Yankee
bonds, which are bonds issued in the U.S. market by foreign
issuers.
   Syndicate officials at Salomon Brothers, which is managing
the tender offer, said the buy-back will be the biggest
tender ever in the Yankee market and one of the few ever
fixed-spread tender offers.
   Rather than offer a fixed price for the bonds, Australia
will pay investors a fixedspread over Treasurys. Australia
has been repaying its debt aggressively since 1987.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were unchanged to 1/8 point higher.
   Trading was light as investors focused on more than $753
million of new issues priced during yesterday's session.
   In one of the largest deals, a PaineWebber Inc. group
tentatively priced $278 million Connecticut single-family
housing mortgage finance program bonds to yield from 6.1% in
1991 to 7.7% in 2022.
   An $81.2 million issue of Charlotte, N.C., general
obligation bonds was won by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group. About $8.8 million of the issue, which was priced to
yield from 5.8% in 1991 to 6.6% in 1999, remained unsold late
yesterday.
   Among active issues, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
bonds due in 2018 were unchanged at 97 7/8 to yield 7.37%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities prices rose as much as 1/8 point.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for September delivery gained 1/8 point to 98 27/32. Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9 1/2% issues for September delivery each rose
2/32 to 98 11/32 and 98 29/32, respectively.
   In the asset-backed market, a $425 million issue
securitized with J.C. Penney credit-card receivables sold
out, according to First Boston Corp. The certificates,
offered through special J.C. Penney Master Credit Card Trust
Series D, carried a coupon rate of 8.70% and were priced at
99 23/32 to yield 8.97%.
   The securities are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   In Japan, bond prices continued to fall on speculation
that the long-term prime rate will be raised again soon.
   The long-term prime rate, which is set monthly by Japan's
long-term credit banks, was increased by .60 percentage point
to 8.5% at the end of last month. The long-term credit banks
try to keep the prime rate at .90 percentage point above the
coupon rate on five-year debentures issued monthly by the
banks.
   The rate on the debentures in September was 7.6%, but the
yield is now at 7.96%. As a result, dealers said the coupon
on October debenture issues is certain to increase, which
would also push up the longterm prime rate.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the No. 119
10-year bond was quoted at a price of 82.07, down 0.35 point,
to yield 8.345%. (When calculated using the semi-annual
compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.64%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   Most West German bonds ended modestly lower. British
government bonds, called gilts, ended moderately higher.
Dealers said that investors have been buying mostly
longer-term gilts because they feel more confident about the
government's anti-inflation measures.
