   DALLAS -- Edisto Resources Corp. said its jointly owned
Hall-Houston Offshore received $20 million in prepayments for
natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. Hall-Houston
Offshore, a venture of Edisto and Hall-Houston Oil Co., will
receive an additional $4.1 million over the term of the
five-year contract.
   Edisto also said it had closed its previously announced
buy-back of Hall-Houston Offshore convertible debentures from
Prudential-Bache investment funds for $17.2 million. Edisto
said it sold at its cost half of the repurchased debt to
Hall-Houston Oil.
