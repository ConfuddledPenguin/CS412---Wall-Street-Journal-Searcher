   WASHINGTON -- Entrepreneurship has been growing much
faster among blacks than among Americans in general, the
government's most comprehensive report on black capitalism
shows.
   The Census Bureau said the number of black-owned companies
in the U.S. jumped 38% in the five years ending in 1987, the
bureau's newest figures, to 424,000 companies. That's roughly
2 1/2 times faster than the 14% growth rate of total new
business formations in the same period.

   While the bulk of black-owned companies remain tiny,
owner-operated "mom and pop" retail and service outlets, the
Census report showed an 87% jump to 70,815 in the number of
black-owned companies with paid employees. The number of
companies with workers had remained virtually unchanged in
the previous five years ending in 1982.
   "I think that's a pretty encouraging sign," said John
Dodds, chief of the Census Bureau's enterprise statistics
branch, which compiles the report. "Before, people were
making a business go just by hard work, maybe with a couple
of family members. Now they're expanding and hiring people.
It shows that black-owned firms are growing beyond the
formative stage."
   Timothy Bates, professor of urban policy at the New School
for Social Research in New York, says the increase in total
black-owned companies is "pretty impressive," but less
significant than the sharp rise in less traditional areas of
black business activity such as business services and
construction. The Census figures show the number of black
general contractors with paid workers doubling in the five
years ending in 1987, and business-service concerns with
employees more than tripling.
   "You're seeing a qualitative shift in the types of
business," said Mr. Bates. "Fewer barber shops and more
business-service companies. These are growth areas."
   But if black business ownership has been surging, other
figures in the Census report paint a more sobering picture of
the economic realities of minority entrepreneurship. Average
annual receipts for all U.S. companies covered by the report
(which didn't include publicly owned corporations) were
$146,000 in the 1983-1987 period, but only $47,000 for the
average black company. The annual sales of slightly more than
half of all black-owned companies were less than $10,000.
   Black-owned concerns in 1987 represented just 3% of all
U.S. companies and accounted for only 1% of gross receipts.
   Harry Brooks, chief executive officer of Advanced Consumer
Marketing Corp., Burlingame, Calif., says problems don't go
away as minority companies get larger. He notes that 19 of
the 100 largest black-owned industrial and service companies
listed by Black Enterprise magazine have gone out of business
in the past year. "That is a scary trend," he says. "When you
lose one of those companies, it's awfully difficult to
replace."
   Mr. Brooks, whose own concern is one of the bigger
black-owned businesses, says shortage of capital is a primary
concern for larger minority-owned companies. "We don't have
the staying power," he adds. "As you start growing, you use
cash at an accelerated pace. If you don't have some semblance
of deep pockets, you can be profitable and still go out of
business."
   Black entrepreneurs who have flourished under
affirmative-action programs also worry they'll be hurt by a
Supreme Court decision last year. In a case brought against
the government of Richmond, Va., the court said nearly all
programs that set aside a share of state and local
public-works programs for minority-owned companies are
unconstitutional. These local set-aside programs were
designed to spur minority-business formation.
   By sales volume, automobile dealers and service stations
ranked at the top of black-owned industry groups with $2.2
billion of receipts in 1987. Next were business services,
health services and special trade contractors.
   Not surprisingly, black business ownership is strongest in
areas with large black populations. The cities with the most
black-owned companies were New York, Los Angeles, Washington,
D.C., Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta.
   The Census Bureau began following minority business
ownership trends in 1969. Tracking down black-owned companies
involves considerable statistical legwork.
   The Internal Revenue Service gives the Census Bureau
names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dollar receipts
of every business tax return filed with the IRS. Names on the
business tax returns are then cross-matched with race codes
on an individual's Social Security application to compile a
list of black business persons. The bureau says its strict
non-disclosure policy protects the confidentiality of the tax
data.
   Mr. Dodds says the bureau also reviews lists from the
Small Business Administration's minority business office, and
various minority company directories in compiling its
five-year survey. "This is a real efficient operation," Mr.
Dodds adds. "It's very inexpensive because it uses existing
records."
   Because of statistical difficulties involved in matching
stockholder ownership by race, the report doesn't include
publicly owned companies, including those that may have
predominantly black ownership.
   Similar reports on companies owned by Hispanics, Asians,
American Indians and women will be released later.
