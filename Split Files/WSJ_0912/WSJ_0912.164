   EDEN, N.C. -- Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., citing dismal
operating results, halved its quarterly dividend on common
stock to 10 cents a share from 20 cents and slashed its
quarterly dividend on Class B stock 56% to eight cents a
share from 18 cents.
   Both dividends are payable Oct. 1 to stock of record Sept.
21.

   The textile concern's senior vice president, finance, K.
William Fraser, said the board voted to cut the payouts "in
response to our current operating results and the weak market
environment."
   Fieldcrest had a second-quarter net loss of $6.1 million,
or 58 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of
$7.7 million, or 74 cents a share. Sales fell to $316.3
million from $346.4 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Fieldcrest shares closed at $8.625, down 25 cents.
