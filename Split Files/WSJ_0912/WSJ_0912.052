   Avery International Corp. and Dennison Manufacturing Co.
said their respective shareholders approved a proposed merger
of the two companies at separate meetings yesterday.
   The affirmative vote represented about 71% of the shares
outstanding of Avery International and 82% of Dennison's
shares outstanding. Both companies make office products among
other things.

   Under terms of the merger, Dennison shareholders will
receive 1.12 shares of Avery common stock for each share held
of Dennison common. The merger will be completed shortly
after the Justice Department finishes its antitrust review,
which is scheduled to occur by Sept. 28, the companies said.
   The successor company, Avery Dennison Corp., would be
dominated by the board of Avery International and based at
its corporate offices in Pasadena, Calif. Dennison is based
in Framingham, Mass.
