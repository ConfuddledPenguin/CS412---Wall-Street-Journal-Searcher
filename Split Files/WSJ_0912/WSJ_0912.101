   New York's attorney general challenged an effort by the
federal thrift-bailout agency to evict eight renters from a
Manhattan condominium building seized by the government from
an insolvent savings and loan.
   In a strongly worded letter to Resolution Trust Corp.'s
executive director, David C. Cooke, state Attorney General
Robert Abrams said the tenants were entitled under the
state's rent control and stabilization laws to occupy the
apartments for as long as they wished.

   The RTC said that the New York case is the first case in
which they have sought evictions, but that the agency was
prepared to do so whenever it was necessary to minimize
losses to U.S. taxpayers.
   The federal government is receiving roughly $9,000 per
month from the midtown apartments, while they are costing the
government about $27,000 per month, according to RTC
spokesman Stephen Katsanos.
   "Public protection shouldn't include throwing people out
of their homes," countered Richard Barr, a spokesman for the
attorney general.
   In August the RTC informed the eight tenants that the 1989
legislation creating the bailout agency gave the government
the right to repudiate their leases. The RTC then offered to
sell the apartments to the tenants.
   The apartments in question were foreclosed on by Nassau
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association when the developer who
converted them into condominiums defaulted on his loan. The
RTC was appointed receiver of the thrift last March.
   In his letter, Mr. Abrams said that New York's Martin Act
bars owners from evicting renters when buildings are
converted to condominiums.
   "RTC should not reap windfall profits by transforming
occupied residential apartments into more valuable vacant
apartments by the draconian measure of evicting the
longstanding tenants of those apartments in violation of New
York law," Abrams wrote.
   Although the attorney general suggested that government
should sell the condominiums as occupied units, the market
for such units was nearly wiped out by the Tax Reform Act of
1986.
   John Jeffries Jr., a professor of constitutional law at
Virginia School of Law, said that although federal law
overrides state law, it is arguable whether Congress intended
to give the RTC the right to take such action.
   Mr. Abrams's office said that it hopes to persuade the RTC
to reverse its action, but that it was up to the tenants
involved to challenge the action in court.
   "No judge in New York is going to allow this," predicted
Errol Brett of New York's Schwartzseld, Ganfer &amp; Shore, which
represents hundreds of tenants associations. "The {federal}
statute doesn't apply to such situations at all."

   INSURERS' TACTICS condemned by judge in toxic-waste
liability dispute.
   Investigators working on behalf of insurance companies
misled former employees of Monsanto Co. about the
investigators' identities and purposes, a state judge in
Delaware ruled.
   In the continuing litigation, the insurers argue that they
aren't liable for certain cleanup costs incurred by Monsanto,
a St. Louis chemicals company. The investigators were seeking
any information about Monsanto's operating practices that
might prove damaging to the company.
   Judge Vincent J. Poppiti ordered Travelers Corp., one of
Monsanto's primary insurers, based in Hartford, Conn., to
provide Monsanto with any former employees' statements
obtained by investigators. He said that evidence won't be
admissible at trial, scheduled to begin in September 1992.
Judge Poppiti didn't specifically blame Travelers for the
alleged misrepresentation.
   The judge also provided a script to be used by
investigators and lawyers when they initiate future
interviews of former Monsanto employees. Among other things,
the script requires the investigators to make clear that
Monsanto and the insurers are in litigation.
   Such high-stakes battles are increasingly common between
companies and their insurers over who should pay for the
burgeoning cost of cleaning up toxic waste allegedly released
by the companies. And insurers believe that interviews with
former employees can be effective in exposing wrongdoing by
the companies that might release the insurers from any
obligation to pay.
   In the Monsanto case, Judge Poppiti noted affidavits by
the former employees stating that, in some instances, the
investigators didn't disclose they represented the insurers.
For example, one former Monsanto employee was allegedly told
that an investigator "worked for a firm in New Orleans which
had been commissioned by the chemical industry to look into
which companies were polluting," according to the judge's
opinion. Two others were allegedly told that investigators
were "compiling a book" about a company plant, the judge
wrote.
   The judge acknowledged that some statements by the former
employees were contradicted by the affidavits of
investigators, but he still found evidence to conclude that
former employees were misled.
   The judge used strong language to condemn any dissembling.
"There is no vice that doth so cover a man with shame as to
be found false and perfidious," he wrote, quoting the
17th-century philosopher Francis Bacon.
   His order doesn't specify individual blame for
misrepresentation among the three dozen or so insurance
companies named by Monsanto as defendants, their outside
lawyers and independent investigators. It wasn't immediately
clear who, if anyone, coordinated the investigators' work.
   Travelers said in a statement that it didn't supervise the
investigators, nor did Travelers' outside lawyers supervise
them. Travelers also said it believes "parties to the case
will seek to clarify this point with the court."
   Judge Poppiti said the lawyers are accountable for the
investigators they retained, and he ordered the lawyers, not
their clients, to pay certain court costs of Monsanto.

   DRUG-CASE DEFENDANTS could lose federal benefits under new
rules.
   People convicted of drug-related crimes, including
possession, may be denied such federal benefits as student
financial aid and small-business loans under sentencing
regulations that took effect yesterday.
   The main purpose of the policy, which Congress mandated in
November 1988, is to provide judges with the authority to
impose sanctions less severe than incarceration in an effort
to deter illegal drug use. Inhibited by crowded prisons and
court dockets, judges rarely sentence people to jail for the
crime of possessing illegal drugs, as opposed to selling
them.
   The new authority applies to both federal and state
judges, who will have broad discretion to deny hundreds of
types of federal benefits. Other benefits that could be
withheld include Federal Communications Commission licenses
and access to various federally run training programs. A
number of major federal programs aren't covered by the
policy, including Social Security, health, disability and
veterans' benefits. The policy provides for eventual
restoration of denied benefits to people who successfully
complete drug-rehabilitation programs.
   Many of the benefits that judges may deny are enjoyed
primarily by people in middle- or upper-income brackets. But
the White House drug czar, William Bennett, noted at a news
conference in Washington that the federal government
subsidizes roughly three million student loans and said, "You
are talking about real impact here." A central thrust of Mr.
Bennett's anti-drug strategy is to toughen punishment of what
he calls "casual" drug use.
   Kevin Zeese, a drug-case defense lawyer in Virginia,
criticized the new form of punishment as "a policy based on
desperation . . . because the prisons and jails are so
overcrowded."
   The new sanctions apply to people convicted after Sept. 1,
1989, for crimes committed on or after Nov. 18, 1988.

   TOBACCO-LIABILITY RULINGS appealed by plaintiff in
American Tobacco case.
   In March, a federal jury in Boston cleared American
Tobacco Co. of liability in the death of Joanne Kotler's
husband, George, who had begun smoking at age 11 and died in
1986 at the age of 55. Stock analysts have said that the jury
verdict in that case helped lift the cloud of liability suits
from the tobacco industry.
   In her appeal, lawyers for Mrs. Kotler asked a federal
appeals court to overturn court rulings that eliminated two
other tobacco companies, Liggett Group Inc. and Philip Morris
Cos., from the original suit.
   They also asked the court to re-examine whether Congress
meant cigarette-pack warnings to protect tobacco companies
from product-liability lawsuits and whether a jury should be
allowed to determine whether cigarettes are a defective
product or present a risk that outweighs smoking's "social
utility."
