   Equifax Inc. said it and Telecredit Inc. set special
meetings of shareholders for Nov. 7 to vote on Equifax's
acquisition of Telecredit in a stock swap currently valued at
about $489 million.
   Equifax, an information-services concern in Atlanta, said
shareholders of record of the two companies as of Sept. 21
will be entitled to vote at the respective meetings.

   The definitive agreement calls for Telecredit shareholders
to receive 2.69 shares of Equifax common for each share held.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Equifax
closed at $16.375 a share, down from $19.50 a share when the
deal was announced June 21. The exchange will bring the price
for Telecredit to $44.05 a share. However, Equifax has the
option, but not the obligation, of increasing the exchange
ratio to bring it to a $50-a-share value. Telecredit, a check
authorizer and credit processor based in Los Angeles,
conversely can terminate the transaction if the deal doesn't
fetch a bottom price of $50 a share.
   Both companies said that proxy materials will be sent to
holders about Sept. 21.
