   WASHINGTON -- Strong exports of goods and services
continue to provide the one bright spot in an otherwise
wilting U.S. economy, according to new Commerce Department
figures.
   The department said the current account trade deficit,
calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, was $21.84 billion
in the second quarter, barely changed from $21.67 billion in
the previous quarter. Exports of goods set a record, and
exports of services rose. Taken together, the two quarters
marked the U.S.'s best trade performance since the early
1980s.

   But analysts caution that rising oil prices will cause the
deficit to widen sharply in the next few months. The U.S.
imports roughly half of its oil, and prices have risen
steeply since the U.S. imposed an embargo on Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil after Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait last
month.
   "Oil is the big clinker," says David Hartman, managing
director of Data Resources Inc. "This data doesn't say much
about the future."
   Strong economic growth overseas is the primary reason for
continued U.S. export growth. Although the U.S. led world
growth throughout much of the 1980s, it now is dragging along
behind its trading partners.
   "The very positive thing in the midst of all the gloom and
doom in the U.S. economy is that, with the exception of
Canada and to some extent Britain, the rest of our trading
partners are growing quite strongly," said Mr. Hartman.
   Merchandise exports expanded to a seasonally adjusted
$159.4 billion in the second quarter from $159.16 billion the
previous quarter. That brought the overall merchandise trade
deficit down to $22.58 billion from $26.28 billion. In 1989,
the deficit exceeded $28 billion in every quarter.
   Exports of services rose to a seasonally adjusted $31.7
billion in the second quarter from $31.4 billion. The U.S.
ran a surplus on services of $6.08 billion, compared with
$6.01 billion in the first quarter.
   The U.S. earned $30.93 billion on its assets abroad in the
second quarter, down slightly from earnings of $31.54 billion
in the first quarter. Foreign earnings on U.S. assets were
$31.56 billion in the most recent quarter, compared with
$29.55 billion. That left the U.S. with an investment income
deficit of $637 million, compared with a surplus of $2
billion in the first quarter.
   The new figures also provide a measure of foreign
investment in the U.S. during the second quarter. Net foreign
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities came to $2.88 billion,
which contrasts with net sales of $835 million in the first
period. Net foreign purchases of other U.S. securities came
to $4.92 billion, up from $2.49 billion.
   Net direct foreign investment in plant, equipment and
companies in the U.S. was $5.01 billion in the second
quarter, compared with $5.54 billion. All the numbers are
adjusted for seasonal variations.
