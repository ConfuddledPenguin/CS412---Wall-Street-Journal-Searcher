   WASHINGTON -- After four months of unproductive talks,
White House and congressional budget negotiators finally
narrowed their differences and say they could reach a
deficit-reduction compromise by late today or tomorrow
morning.
   "I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has
not always seemed so smooth," President Bush said in a
televised address to Congress last night.

   "But with or without an agreement from the budget summit,
I ask both houses of Congress to allow a straight up-or-down
vote on a complete $500 billion deficit reduction package not
later than Sept. 28."
   The Republican and Democratic sides are converging on a
compromise that would raise taxes about $130 billion net over
the next five years -- including an energy tax of some sort,
a new tax on luxury goods and higher taxes on alcoholic
beverages.
   Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and
$200 billion from projected levels, based on proposals
offered by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts
would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with
both sides now proposing to make the elderly pay a bigger
share of the cost of the rapidly growing Medicare program.
Savings on interest costs would account for the balance of
the $500 billion package. Even if negotiators agree to cut
the deficit $50 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
and the package is enacted, the federal deficit will still
approach $200 billion, the White House budget office
estimates. As a result, any pact will have to waive the $64
billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   Administration and Republican congressional negotiators
emerged more optimistic than previously from the fifth day of
talks at nearby Andrews Air Force Base. That optimism was
largely the result of Democratic plans offered Monday night
and yesterday that sharply reduced proposed increases in
domestic spending and increased planned cuts in federal
benefit programs.
   "We're going to make it," said negotiator Sen. Bob
Packwood (R., Ore.). "We need a day to finish the product and
let everybody look it."
   "We're about 60% through," said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski
(D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   But others cautioned that the talks could still fall apart
over some sticky issues -- including Mr. Bush's insistence on
cutting the capital-gains tax rate, which he reiterated last
night, and the demands of Democrats to increase some domestic
spending programs.
   "Democrats can't resist the urge to spend more,"
complained Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.). Sen. Robert Byrd
(D., W.Va.) "entertains us daily with long discourses on the
subject." One Byrd speech accused White House Budget Director
Richard Darman and Chief of Staff John Sununu of being
"arrogant, insipid and almost obscene," other negotiators
said.
   After a long caucus, Democrats made a new proposal shortly
before the talks recessed yesterday. Republicans are expected
to respond when the talks resume today at the air base.
   In their new plan, Democrats call for people with incomes
above $500,000 year to pay a "temporary surtax" of 20%,
double the surtax they proposed initially, a summary of their
proposal showed. But they dropped their demand for an
increase to 35%, from the present 28%, in the marginal
income-tax rate levied on the highest-income Americans. The
temporary surtax, however, effectively would raise the top
tax rate to 33.6% for people who make more than $500,000 a
year. The Democrats also abandoned a proposal to increase the
alternative minimum tax -- paid by upper-income individuals
who would otherwise avoid taxes -- to 26% from the present
21%.
   But Democratic aides warn that if Republicans continue to
press for a cut in the capital-gains tax rate, Democrats will
revive their proposal to raise income-tax rates on
upper-income people. And Republicans vow to oppose any rate
increases. Mr. Bush said the package "must avoid any measure
that would threaten economic growth or turn us back toward
the days of punishing income-tax rates."
   Republicans continue to back a $10,000 limit on deductions
for state and local income taxes as a way to increase the tax
burden on the rich. But while Republicans aimed at a
deficit-reduction package that leaves the tax burden on the
rich and poor roughly the same as they are now, Democrats
want to hit the rich harder than the poor and middle class.
   "The working people who got almost nothing from the tax
cuts of the past must not be asked to pay most of the tax
increases of today," House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt
of Missouri said in his response to Mr. Bush's speech. The
Democrats' latest offer would substantially increase the
earned-income credit for the working poor and enlarge other
tax breaks for low-income taxpayers to compensate for other
tax increases.
   Democrats and Republicans are both proposing to make the
elderly pay a bigger share of the cost of Medicare. The 33
million Medicare beneficiaries currently pay a monthly
premium of $28.60 for Part B coverage, which pays for 80% of
"reasonable charges" for doctors' services after the first
$75.
   Republicans have advanced a plan to increase the monthly
premium for individuals earning more than $40,000 and couples
earning more than $51,200 and establish a new sliding scale,
according to people close to the talks. After a phase-in
period, the premium could exceed $100 for those with incomes
of $100,000 or more.
   One Democrat close to the talks said that Democrats were
prepared to accept that proposal but that Republicans were
backing away from it.
   The Democrats' proposal would instead raise the premium
for all beneficiaries to cover 30% of the costs of Medicare
Part B, up from the 25% level in current law, participants in
the talks say. Both sides also would extract additional
savings from doctors, an important move to avoid a firestorm
of protest from the vocal elderly lobby.
   At least so far, negotiators say there has been little
discussion of cutting back Social Security benefits in any
fashion.
   Although both sides are considering energy taxes, their
proposals differ. Democrats now are backing a broad-based 4%
levy, having abandoned their initial proposal to begin with a
2% tax and increase it to 4% in the second year, as well as a
seven-cent increase in the nine-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax.
So far, Republicans have proposed an increase of only one
cent a gallon on petroleum fuels of all kinds.
   As the talks wore on, Congress has continued to approve
spending bills for new fiscal year. The Senate yesterday
voted 93-6 to approve an estimated $20.7 billion measure
funding the Treasury and Postal Service.
