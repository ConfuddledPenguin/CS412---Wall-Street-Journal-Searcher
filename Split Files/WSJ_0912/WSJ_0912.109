   TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., hungry for fresh capital,
is thinking of selling stock in its Bank of California
subsidiary.
   The giant Japanese bank -- the world's fourth biggest,
with $357 billion in assets -- is considering a private
placement of new shares in its wholly owned subsidiary as a
way of meeting stringent international capital-adequacy
requirements, according to Kyota Ohmori, general manager of
Mitsubishi's planning department.

   "It is one of the alternatives we are considering now,"
Mr. Ohmori said in an interview.
   San Francisco-based Bank of California has been owned by
Mitsubishi since 1984, when the Japanese bank bought it for
$284 million. It is the sixth-largest bank in the state,
Mitsubishi said, with assets of about $8 billion. It operates
in Oregon and Washington as well.
   Trying to raise capital by selling stock in Bank of
California would mark an intensification of the aggressive
competition for fresh money among Japanese banks. Under rules
drafted two years ago by the Bank for International
Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, major international banks
will be required by their governments to keep capital on hand
equivalent to roughly 8% of their assets. That means, for
every $100 a bank lends, it must keep $8 on hand.
   Until last year, Japan's huge banks assumed they could
easily meet the new capital-adequacy ratios, which come into
effect in early 1993. But they had counted on using as
capital some of their vast holdings of stock in client
companies. A collapse on Japan's stock market this year has
erased a third of share value, though, reducing those
holdings and making it difficult for banks to raise capital
more conventionally through the stock market. As a result,
banks are scrambling for other ways to find capital.
   Over the past two weeks, seven Japanese banks, including
Mitsubishi, have announced plans to raise capital by issuing
subordinated debt, which can be used as capital under the BIS
rules.
   Selling stock in Bank of California is another way to
increase the bank's dollar-denominated capital base, Mr.
Ohmori said. Because Bank of California is a subsidiary, its
capital counts as part of Mitsubishi Bank's consolidated
capital base. Even though Mr. Ohmori said the amount the bank
would raise might be small, "it's better than nothing."
