   Virginia and Rodney Bunker, white liberals from the Age of
Aquarius, were certain that their adoption of needy black
children not only was a good deed but also moved America
closer to true integration.
   They were hardly ready for the shock they encountered at
an adoption convention in St. Louis. There, before a hushed
crowd of scores of white couples cuddling their black babies,
the president of the National Association of Black Social
Workers accused them all of cultural genocide. Their
children, he charged, wouldn't develop black pride and a
black identity, both sorely needed to grapple with society
and racism.

   "There was incredible hurt in that crowd," Ms. Bunker
recalls, the memory still vivid 18 years later. "I was in
terrible pain." Mothers nearby, some of whom were taking
hormones so they could breast-feed their babies, wept openly.
Several parents were evicted as pitched, emotional arguments
over reverse racism broke out in the convention hall. Others,
fearful they would destroy their babies' lives, soon gave
them back to adoption agencies.
   It was a watershed event in the adoption world. The
5,000-member black social workers group went on record
opposing what had become an accepted, even fashionable
practice in the activist 1960s and early 1970s. Adoption
agencies, which in 1971 had placed more than a third of their
black infants with white parents, were loath to court
controversy, and many began to bar so-called transracial
adoptions altogether.
   But a fierce debate over transracial adoption continues,
focusing attention on the fate of the Bunkers' four black
children and 20,000 other transracially adopted youngsters.
Mounting numbers of white parents are clamoring to adopt,
while tens of thousands of black children are languishing in
foster care because adoption agencies either can't or, as
some critics suggest, barely try to find them black parents.
   "Black children can rot in foster care, or they can be
adopted by white families," contends Mary Beth Seader, vice
president for the nonprofit National Committee for Adoption.
Her group is lobbying to start transracial adoptions anew and
remove restrictions on them in 35 states.
   The studies done on transracial adoptions show mixed
results. Clearly, the children are affected by influences all
adolescents face growing up: peer pressure, sibling rivalry,
occasional feelings of alienation. But without doubt, the
transracial environment generates its own adjustment and
identity issues.
   In many cases, the studies show the children achieving
well and developing high self-esteem. Kirsten Albrecht, who
is black, was adopted as a baby by white parents. She is now
19 years old and an accelerated student at the University of
Chicago. "I look very positively on interracial adoption,"
she says. "I felt like I had the best of two worlds." She
says she is loved by her parents, both ministers, and that's
what matters.
   But the research also shows that adjustment can be painful
and, often, unsuccessful. Many of the children say that being
black in a white family impeded their efforts "to belong,"
doubly important to an adopted child. It openly advertised
what they most wanted to forget: that they had been given up
by their natural parents. At times, these children roamed a
racial no man's land, outcasts from both black and white
society, a reminder of the great gap between the two worlds.
"These kids often don't know who they are or where they fit
in," says Virginia Sturgeon, a program specialist with
Kentucky's "special needs" adoption program.
   Here is how five black youngsters -- and their adoptive
white parents -- have dealt with the complex social
experiment of transracial adoption:
                                                                                                       

   Nathan Hatton
                                                                                                       

   Nathan Hatton was uncomfortable. The 22-year-old Eastern
Michigan University freshman had decided to spend more time
with black people, so he found himself one night at an Ann
Arbor bar drinking beer with black college acquaintances. But
when several white buddies showed up from Farmington Hills, a
nearby Detroit suburb where Nathan grew up, he began
frantically switching between trying to sound black and
trying to sound white. Both groups ridiculed him for the
attempts until Nathan fled, feeling humiliated.
   "I don't feel I'm being me around black people -- they
aren't like us," Nathan says, motioning to the three white
schoolmates with whom he shares a dilapidated house. After he
left the bar in confusion, Nathan says, "I resigned myself to
not being black. I'm not going to act something I don't want
to be. Who is to say I have to be black? It's so trivial."
   Nathan's adoptive mother, Elizabeth, says she never
thought her son would grow up so confused about his race.
Mrs. Hatton, a guidance counselor who often cried at the
dinner table while discussing the state of public schools in
Detroit, wanted a better life for Nathan. She considers
herself "colorblind" and didn't worry about her son being
reared in a nearly all-white suburb away from others of his
race. "Color is foolishness," she says. "You don't pick your
family and friends because of their color." Adds William
Hatton, Nathan's adoptive father: "I don't see a great deal
of advantage to adopting the same race."
   But from the time he was a tot, color made Nathan the
outsider. Unlike Andrew, his white brother, who was also
adopted, Nathan found himself repeatedly having to explain
what he saw as a devastating rejection by his birth parents.
"I used to say my parents were killed in a plane crash. I
didn't want anyone to think I was given up," he says. Nathan
says his adoptive grandfather always bounced his three white
siblings on his lap, but left the room when he entered. He
remembers a racist neighbor bellowing epithets at the front
door of the Hattons' red-brick townhouse, then threatening to
crucify him or run him over with a car.
   Nathan was only a few years old when he began trying to
look white, spending hours in the bathroom plastering down
his hair. He would get down on all fours and drag his head on
the living-room carpet, straining to straighten the kinks. He
craved acceptance, and tried to ease the tension of being
different by making people laugh, often at his own expense.
He was expelled from his nursery school for jumping from cot
to cot during nap time and pulling wallpaper off the walls of
the director's office. At five, Nathan perched naked on the
sill of a second-story window at his house, pounding his
chest and screaming: "I'm a nigger] I'm a nigger]" At 10, he
attempted suicide by swallowing a bottle of aspirin.
   "He needed someone to listen," says his sister Lydia. "We
were taught that children should repress anger, should be
seen but not heard."
   Nathan constantly battled older grade-school boys who made
him the target of racial insults, and broke one taunting
fifth grader's nose. He racked up 16 suspensions in the
seventh grade and spent time in several juvenile homes for
joy-riding accidents and car theft. His parents still sleep
with the car keys under their pillow and their valuables
locked behind a bolted bedroom door.
   Nathan says his limited experiences with blacks have been
alienating. Black children threw stones at him when his
mother took him to her inner-city office. He stormed out of a
meeting at a black college fraternity when talk turned to
what Nathan considered racist diatribes against white people.
   Jane Collie, the Hattons' only close black friend and
Nathan's childhood piano teacher, says, "Nathan can't deal
with blacks, but he has to accept himself for what he is."
The young man now says he is proud of his adoptive parents,
and grateful that they stuck by him. He adds that he plans to
associate with whites or Asians on campus, with whom he feels
more at ease. "I don't care what people say so much any more.
I'll lose my mind if I worry about it," he says. "I have to
feel better about myself."
                                                                                                       

   Samantha Davidge

   Samantha Davidge has almost always felt good about
herself. "There is nothing black parents could have done
better," says Samantha, 25. "I never felt I wanted a black
mother." She says she is able to feel comfortable with both
races. "Some of my {black friends} feel antsy if there are
too many whites in a crowd," she says. And, she is less quick
to blame many problems on racism. "A lot of my black friends
see themselves as victims. They are always defensive.
Sometimes that's best, but sometimes, it's not."
   Samantha gives lots of credit to her mother, Rosaearl.
Herself a foster child, Rosaearl went on to raise 12 foster
children plus four of her own in the San Fernando Valley
section of Los Angeles. Samantha says her mother carefully
nourished her self-esteem and confidence, and hammered home
that people's prejudices are their own problem.
   On a recent day, Rosaearl, a graying woman clad in
threadbare blue jeans, sat amid a clutter of cribs in their
stuccoed Southern California house feeding "little Miss
Cocaine Fits," one of her foster children who suffered from
drug or sexual abuse.
   Rosaearl Davidge is angry that opposition to transracial
adoptions has cut their number to only about 1,000 a year,
leaving many of the 14,400 adoptable black children bouncing
between various institutions or foster homes, which are
usually white. Half, by most estimates, will never find a
permanent home. Meanwhile, as many as two million families
want to adopt children, and 8,000 other couples this year
will choose to go abroad to adopt, taking home mostly
children from Korea and South America but also black babies
from Africa.
   Samantha says that at times in her life she suffered
because of her lack of familiarity with blacks. White girls
accepted her until junior high school, when "suddenly it was
not OK for the white kids I had grown up with to hang out
with me." Samantha didn't know any black youngsters except
for the inner-city children bused to her school; to her, they
seemed loud and intimidating. She was friendly for a time
with two local black girls, but when the three drifted apart
the two girls harangued her in a classroom, loudly saying
that she considered herself superior because she had a white
mother. "You're nothing but an Oreo," Samantha recalls them
shouting.
   But Samantha befriended other black girls and boys, some
of whom seemed stunned when her white mother greeted them at
the door. As a University of Southern California graduate
student in social work, Samantha says she is comfortable with
her race. "Society sees me as black," she says. "There's no
way I could do otherwise."
                                                                                                       

   Sarah Bunker
                                                                                                       

   Four years ago, a pregnant Sarah Bunker bolted upright in
bed, drenched with sweat from a nightmare. In the vision, a
white child had emerged from her womb, a child destined to
live the anxious life that has been Sarah's since a white
couple adopted her.
   "There have been so many times she needed someone to whom
she could relate experientially," says Sarah's mother,
Virginia, who adopted Sarah as a toddler before the family
journeyed to the 1972 St. Louis adoption convention. "I have
known the pain and frustration of wanting to be a black
parent" for her four adopted black children, she adds.
   It's not that the Bunkers haven't made sacrifices. In
1977, Sarah's father, Rodney, quit his tenure-track job as a
University of Wisconsin political science professor to move
from mostly white Eau Claire, Wis., to more racially mixed
Minneapolis, Minn. He has driven a city bus there for more
than a decade.
   Sarah played with black dolls. She took camping trips with
the Open Door Society, a group of families with transracially
adopted children. A portrait of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. hangs above the fireplace of the Bunkers' house. "Mom
constantly told us how special it was to be black," says
Sarah, now 21.
   For Sarah's brother Joshua, who is also black and adopted,
the environment proved richly nurturing. His parents
"encouraged me to experience black culture and my heritage,"
says Joshua, a recent graduate in East Asian studies from
Yale University. "There was no time I wanted to yell at them:
Why aren't you black? There was no time I felt a lack of
love. I felt fortunate for the stability of the family and
their economic means. I could have been raised by other
parents, less educated or less able to support me."
   But Sarah saw it differently. She says she felt like a
black person stuck with a white person's ways, appearance and
values. Blacks in her Minneapolis junior high school talked
differently, were more clothes-conscious and wore their hair
in neat cornrows. Sarah wore utilitarian garb and two braids
protruding from the sides of her head. "When you looked at
me," she says, "you knew I had white parents." Her black
schoolmates, she says, also seemed tough and more
confrontational; her parents counseled pacifism. "Why do you
walk like that?" one black classmate demanded. "Why don't you
get a little soul?" Sarah screamed back: "I have white
parents. It isn't my fault]"
   She became obsessed that something was wrong with her.
When she visited her adoptive grandparents in Rhinelander,
Wis., people in restaurants stared with their mouths agape.
"I felt like a big bright spotlight was on me all the time
because I had white parents," Sarah says. She hated dining
out alone with her father for fear others would take her for
a prostitute.
   In the ninth grade, Sarah suddenly gained 20 pounds, had
continual crying jags and saw her grades plummet. "I felt so
alone. I felt like an outcast. I wanted to be like other
blacks so badly," she says. "I felt that if I had black
parents, I would have fit in."
   Sarah says she later found comfort when she rebelled
against her parents and moved in with her black boyfriend.
She has since given birth to two children and says that
creating her own black family has finally brought her some
peace.
   Sarah says one positive aspect of growing up in white
society is that she now feels she understands whites better
than her friends do. She says her friends, who are mostly
black, view whites as distant authority figures generally out
to do them harm. "I can understand both worlds," she says.
"I've been on both sides."
   Still, she seethes when she sees white parents with a
black child. "I know they love the child to death," she says.
"But when I think of the kid I say: What a terrible thing."
                                                                                                       

   Kurt Reinhardt
                                                                                                       

   On a car trip last Christmas to his adoptive grandmother's
house, Kurt Reinhardt revealed the deep grudge he holds
against white society. He told his brother Eric, who is
white, that to develop their real potential blacks must live
separately from whites, and should use violent means if
necessary to cleave the two societies.
   Growing up in a white family hurt his own development,
says Kurt, 20. "Self-love was not there. All I came out with
was a collage of confusion." Since he began attending
predominantly black Howard University a year ago, he says he
wishes he had grown up in the black culture, too.
   Such thinking is a radical change for Kurt. For years, he
says, being part of a white family let him feel privileged
and different from other blacks. He used to drag Eric to
parties in his hometown of Lexington, Ky., to make the point
that he was from a white family. Amie Winn, his high-school
sweetheart, says Kurt told her he was better than her
previous black boyfriends because only one of his birth
parents was black. "He thought he was unique, that he didn't
belong to either category," says Eric. When he took a college
entrance test at age 17, he couldn't decide what to indicate
as his race, so he left the box blank.
   Kurt saw little advantage to viewing himself as black
while growing up. In the sixth grade, his principal bluntly
told Kurt, after he had fought a white boy over a young
girl's affections, that the girl's parents didn't want her to
date blacks. At the local department store, security guards
shadowed him, assuming he would steal, he says. And police
officers often stopped him to ask what he was doing in the
white neighborhood where he lived.
   "I enjoyed being the token," Kurt says. "I played soccer
and ate oysters on the half shell. Black people played
basketball and ate chitterlings." The illusions held until
his senior year in high school when he injured a knee and
many of his white friends, mostly soccer players, became more
distant after he was no longer on the team, he says. Kurt
became miserable. He gained 25 pounds and contemplated
suicide. As a freshman at the University of Kentucky the next
year, he felt rejected by both whites and blacks. He sank
into introversion and got a Mohawk haircut.
   Now at Howard, Kurt says he feels much more accepted. He
no longer averts his eyes from other blacks. During a stint
selling books door-to-door this summer, he purposely nods as
they pass him on the street.
                                                                                                       

   John Raible

   John Raible was Milwaukee's first transracially adopted
child. Now 30, he still sounds bitter when he talks about how
his parents minimized his being black. When he applied for a
Social Security card his mother said he should check the box
indicating he was white. When his high-school counselor
advised applying for a minority scholarship, his parents
"said to give it to a more deserving, real black student,"
John recalls.
   "We didn't want him to feel different from the other
children," says his mother, Patricia, who emphasizes that one
of John's birth parents is white, the other black. "We did
view him as essentially white," she says. "He was raised as
our son, just as we raised our other two children." John, an
elementary-school teacher who now lives in a Long Beach,
Calif., apartment lined with African masks, counters: "They
didn't understand how I felt as a person of color."
   Because they considered him white, John's parents played
down his encounters with racism. When his junior prom was
held at a country club that didn't allow blacks, he says,
they offered excuses for why it wasn't important that he
attend the affair. They didn't notice his dismay when, in the
seventh grade, classmates taunted him, comparing his skin to
the color of excrement. He began sucking in his lips so they
would seem thinner, more Caucasian.
   John gave up trying to talk to his parents about race
problems; he became a loner and his school grades dropped to
D's. He was terrified of the few blacks he encountered and
tended to stereotype them. When his father, a Unitarian
minister, took 10-year-old John to New York and visited the
United Nations building, 30 black children who came into the
gift shop together seemed rude, pushy and intimidating to
him. "All I knew of blacks was what I saw on TV -- all
negative, clownish people like George Jefferson. Or
criminals," he says. The only other black at his private high
school was the son of a trustee's maid.
   "I felt isolated and confused," John says. "You can't
raise kids to just think of themselves as human beings. You
must acknowledge that they are black, and will be perceived
as black." He adds, "It's not possible for white parents to
teach blacks about identity and racism." Slowly, he began to
seek out black experiences by listening to black radio
stations and mingling with other blacks at the local mall.
   John says adoption agencies are inflexible and too slow to
find black parents for black babies. He is single but adopted
his own black son, Kelly, three years ago, and says he now
realizes how hard raising a child can be. Still, it was only
after years of anger, during which he refused to speak to his
parents, that he finally visited them this summer. "Loving
me," he says simply, "just wasn't enough."
