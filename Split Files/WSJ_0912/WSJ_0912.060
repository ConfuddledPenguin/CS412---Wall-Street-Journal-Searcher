   New York's Mayor David Dinkins last month formed a
committee to advise him on New York City's competitiveness in
financial services. Friday, the committee produced the
following statement on the stock transfer tax, one of the
proposals being considered by the president and Congress in
this week's budget negotiations:

   Recent discussions of the federal budget deficit have
raised the possibility of a securities transfer excise tax of
between 15 and 50 basis points, or 0.15% and 0.5%. STET would
tax all sales of marketable securities (including stocks,
bonds and commercial paper) other than Treasuries. Reaction
to this proposal has been overwhelmingly negative. Several
studies demonstrate the adverse impact STET would have on the
U.S. economy and, in particular, on New York. We agree with
the emerging consensus that STET would seriously, and perhaps
irreversibly, damage the competitive viability of the U.S.
securities markets and its financial institutions. STET would
also have the short-term effect of further depressing the
U.S. stock market, which has already fallen by 10% since
mid-July.
   To help foster public understanding as to why STET would
cause severe, self-inflicted injury to our financial markets,
impairing their global competitiveness, we address the most
important issues raised in regard to STET.
                                                                                                       

   How can a tax of of less than half a percent erode the
competitive position of the U.S. securities industry?
   The tax only appears to be insignificant. Total
transaction costs typically paid by institutions such as
pension funds and insurance companies (which are responsible
for 70% of trading) are only four or five basis points. Thus,
at 15 basis points, STET would triple transaction costs for
institutions.
                                                                                                       

   Aren't securities transfer taxes prevalent in most major
overseas markets?
   They used to be. Many countries -- Germany, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom -- that have had such
taxes are in the process of either reducing, repealing or
phasing them out.
                                                                                                       

   Would STET drive securities trading overseas?
   The answer is yes; the real issue is not whether but to
what extent. There is good reason to believe the losses would
be very substantial. One consequence would be to reduce
anticipated revenues from STET. A more enduring consequence
would be to weaken our financial markets.
   The securities business is characterized by high
efficiency, low margins and intense competition. Thus, a
tripling of transaction costs is not likely to be merely a
speck of "sand in the gears" of securities trading. By
analogy, the historical disparity in transfer tax rates
between France and the U.K. is thought to be responsible for
the fact that London trading in French securities is 20% of
the trading volume on the entire Paris Bourse.
   The revolution in information and communication technology
has shrunk the global marketplace, making capital mobility in
the 1990's higher than at any other time in history. Trading
in New York is easily shifted to London or Tokyo with
virtually no increase in costs. Trading links among exchanges
actually facilitate the migration of securities transactions.
   Foreign investors, who today account for about 12% of the
trading volume in the U.S. equity market, would be likely to
move their trading activities to more cost-competitive
markets. STET would accelerate the recent (and already
dramatic) growth in the number of U.S. stocks listed abroad.
Given problems of enforcement, U.S. investors in foreign
securities, including American Depositary Receipts, and even
in U.S. securities, may be expected to move offshore to less
expensive markets.
   In order to deter avoidance, STET is expected to apply to
trades by Americans on foreign exchanges. There is a
widespread view, however, that effective enforcement of
foreign trading would be extremely difficult and expensive.
   The commercial paper market, one of the few securities
markets in which the U.S. remains pre-eminent, would be
particularly susceptible to offshore migration, due to the
short maturity of commercial paper, which increases the
relative impact of STET on returns, and the high sensitivity
of this market to transaction costs.
   Trading in futures on securities, which are settled only
in cash, can easily be moved offshore. The mobility of this
market became evident on Oct. 20, 1987, when price limits on
the Chicago Board of Trade Treasury bond contract were
reached. The trading immediately moved to a similar contract
in London, where the usual volume increased that day by a
factor of eight.
   The history of the Eurobond market provides another
example of how domestic tax policy can have the unintended
effect of moving a securities market offshore. In 1963, the
U.S., as part of a balance of payments policy, levied a 1%
interest equalization tax on foreign borrowing to induce
foreigners to borrow in currencies other than the dollar.
That tax rapidly drove dollar-denominated borrowing overseas,
where it could not be taxed by the U.S., giving rise to the
Eurobond market, which thrived even after the tax was
rescinded and which continues to draw a large volume of
business away from U.S. markets.
                                                                                                       

   Would STET reduce stock market volatility?
   Some economists have argued that STET would reduce
volatility in the stock market. However, throwing "sand in
the gears" would only assure less liquidity. Many believe
STET would increase, rather than decrease, volatility.
Transaction taxes did not prevent the Tokyo and London stock
markets from crashing in 1987. STET's restraint on trading
volume would cause information to be reflected in prices in
large doses, providing a more discontinuous (jerky) market
with larger price swings.
   Studies by the Brady Commission, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, the
Congressional Research Service and the Federal Reserve Board
have all concluded that volatility is not materially greater
today than it has been in the past. Both in its certainty of
result and its severity of consequence, the harm to liquidity
would far outweigh the speculative effects on volatility.
   While applauding the efforts now under way to cut the
deficit, we deplore the STET proposal, because the long-term
damage it would cause to the competitive viability of our
securities markets and financial institutions would greatly
exceed all the tax revenues it could produce.
