   Enron Corp. said agreements have been reached for power
sales, joint-venture operations and gas supply for its
proposed $1.1 billion power project in Teesside, England.
   The Houston-based energy concern said the 1,725-megawatt
facility will be at ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd.'s Wilton
Works plant in Teesside, in northeast England. ICI is a unit
of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC.

   The project is subject to a number of regulatory approvals
and would add roughly 3% to the power-generating capacity of
England and Wales. Sales agreements have been reached for all
1,725 megawatts of capacity.
   The power sales agreements have an initial term of 15
years beginning April 1, 1993, with options to extend. Enron
said four regional electricity companies are expected to
assume a 50% equity ownership, while it will retain the
remaining 50% stake. ICI has an option to purchase up to 10%
of Enron's equity in the facility after commercial operation
has begun. The company said it expects to realize income from
certain project development fees this year, but didn't
elaborate.
