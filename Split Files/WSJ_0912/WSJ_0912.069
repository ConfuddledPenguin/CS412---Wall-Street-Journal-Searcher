   BAGHDAD, Iraq -- The Iraqi capital's landscape is
dominated, as it has been for a decade, by a single theme:
the face and figure of Saddam Hussein. But the iconography of
the Iraqi leader has shifted in revealing and sometimes
ominous ways.
   During and immediately after the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam
Hussein, like George Orwell's Big Brother, was watching you
at every turn. He stared down from portraits on all four
walls of the arrival terminal at Saddam International
Airport. He gazed out from mammoth billboards lining the road
into town. He was there waiting for you on TV, often with a
chorus singing praise in the background. He even eyed you
from the dials of wristwatches worn by Iraqi officials.

   Now, the airport portraits are gone, and intersections
that once displayed four paintings are down to only one. Much
scarcer, too, are images of the warrior-president, in combat
helmet or clutching a machine gun.
   In their place are portraits of a kinder, gentler leader,
who cuddles children, prays often and cooks his own food. But
the new and improved Saddam Hussein has another dimension as
well. Several new likenesses are three stories high,
including one enormous statue of Saddam Hussein standing
stiffly at attention, his arm outstretched at a 45 degree
angle. Many billboards show the president in a Tyrolean hat,
set against an alpine setting utterly foreign to
Mesopotamia's sun-baked plains.
   "This year's Saddam," says a veteran diplomat, "is one
part Caesar, and one part Adolf Hitler."
   Diplomats and Western residents say many pictures came
down early this year, possibly as a reaction to the overthrow
of Nicolae Ceaucescu, whose Romanian regime bore
uncomfortable resemblances to Saddam Hussein's. Officially,
there has been no change in what Iraqis insist is a
spontaneous outpouring of artistic adoration for the
president. Asked why so many portraits have disappeared, a
Ministry of Information official says, "It is normal. They
need to be cleaned."
   While the quantity is diminished, the scale of new
artworks is monumental. One new sculpture of the president is
visible from a half-mile away; an older artwork that occupied
an adjoining traffic circle, titled "Arab Horseman," has been
removed so as not to obstruct the view of the president.
"Normally you must be dead before they put up something so
big," says a taxi driver.
   Nearby, crossed swords rise a hundred feet into the air at
either end of a parade ground. At the hilt of each saber is a
hand of Pharaonic grandeur, modeled on the hand of Saddam
Hussein. In the same complex, workmen are completing an
Eiffel Tower-like structure, mounted with an enormous clock
and soon to be decorated with scenes from the president's
life.
   "London has Big Ben, now Baghdad will have a big clock,
too," says a watchseller named Mourad Salim.
   The display in Mr. Salim's shop includes much more modest
timepieces whose dials are decorated with the president's
face. Mr. Salim says sales are brisk in these days of
conflict with the West. But other watchsellers confide that
the watches are distributed to them free by the government
and don't attract many buyers. "People see his face all over
the place," says one merchant. "They don't need to look at
him every minute on their wrist."
   A few doors down, at a bookstore, the window is filled
with works by and about Adolf Hitler, decorated with
swastikas and translated into Arabic. One of the newest
monuments in Baghdad honors four Nazi-backed colonels who led
a failed revolt in 1941 against Iraq's British-backed rulers.
   In a statement directed at President Bush last month,
Saddam Hussein complained that "you have compared me to some
of the negative characteristics of Hitler" -- implying that
there is a positive side to the Nazi leader. One diplomat's
description of a recent meeting with Saddam Hussein sounds
straight out of Charlie Chaplin's satire on Hitler, "The
Great Dictator." The president, he says, holds his hand
extremely low when greeting visitors, forcing them to bow as
they shake hands.
   Some observers link these Hitlerian echoes to Saddam
Hussein's campaign to become leader of the anti-Israel
struggle -- a quest that included his threat to scorch half
of Israel with poison gas if attacked by the Jewish state.
   Equally pronounced is the president's obsession with
dynastic themes. Long cast as a revolutionary who rose from
humble origins to help topple imperialist forces, Saddam
Hussein increasingly links himself to the "ancien regime."
The Hashemite monarchy, installed by the British in Iraq
after World War I and overthrown in 1958, gradually is being
rehabilitated. The royal tombs have been fixed up after years
of neglect. A traffic circle long-named for the Arab
nationalist, Gamel Abdel Nasser, was recently renamed Faisal
Square, with a statue of the Hashemite king at its center,
replacing a similar one torn down by angry mobs in 1958.
   "It's an insult to those of us who risked our lives
fighting the monarchy," says one Iraqi.
