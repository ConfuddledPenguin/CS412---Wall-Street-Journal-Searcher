   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal court jury in California ruled
that Advanced Micro Devices Inc. infringed on patents and
copyrights owned by Brooktree Corp., a small chip maker in
San Diego.
   Brooktree sued AMD in late 1988, charging that the
Sunnyvale, Calif., chip company illegally used three
Brooktree patents in computer chips called "color palettes,"
which control colors on personal-computer screens. Brooktree
also charged that AMD infringed on certain Brooktree "mask
work" rights, the rights to the layouts of circuits in a
semiconductor chip.

   In ruling against AMD on mask rights the federal court in
San Diego became the first, Brooktree and AMD officials said,
to reach a verdict under the Semiconductor Chip Protection
Act, a law enacted in 1984 to protect unprotected chip masks.
AMD said it planned to appeal the ruling.
   The verdict is a big victory for Brooktree, a private
company that expects something over $60 million in revenue
this year. The company's sales were growing rapidly until
1988, when AMD started making its offending chips, said
Brooktree president James Bixby. The type of chip involved
comprises nearly 50% of Brooktree's revenue, said Mr. Bixby.
"We slammed into a brick wall when AMD came in" and began
competing with low-priced knock-offs, said Mr. Bixby in a
phone interview from a party celebrating the victory.
   An AMD spokesman said that the company didn't copy
Brooktree's chips and that any infringement on patents was
inadvertent. AMD invented color palette technology, the
spokesman said, and AMD's chips were on the market before the
Brooktree patents were granted. AMD has a patent-infringement
case pending against Brooktree, he added, and AMD's patents
are broader than Brooktree's.
   "We believe that the verdict is not supported by the facts
of the case," said Thomas Armstrong, AMD's general counsel,
in a written statement. AMD said that its color palette chips
involved in the case represented less than 1% of its $1.1
billion revenue in 1989.
   The jury is expected to decide later this month on
damages.
