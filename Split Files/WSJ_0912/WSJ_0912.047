   Kimberly-Clark Corp. and New York Times Co. said they
broke off negotiations to sell their jointly owned newsprint
mill to Kruger Inc. after the Montreal-based paper company
failed to secure financing for the purchase.
   The companies say Spruce Falls Power &amp; Paper Co. in remote
Kapuskasing, Ont., remains for sale. "We are disappointed,"
the companies said in a joint statement. "We felt that Kruger
was in a better position to capitalize on the strengths of
Spruce Falls."

   Kimberly-Clark, a Dallas paper and consumer-products
company, will not reverse the $44 million charge it took in
the second quarter anticipating the sale of the mill. Losses
at the mill have hurt both companies. A Kruger spokesman
declined to comment.
   Kimberly-Clark stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at
$75.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
while New York Times stock also fell 12.5 cents a share to
close at $19 in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
