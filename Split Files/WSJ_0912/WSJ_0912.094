   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., maker of Subaru automobiles,
said that it won't be paying its previously planned interim
dividend for the half-year period ending Sept. 30.
   Although unconsolidated sales are expected to see a
healthy 10% increase in the half year from the prior period,
the Tokyo-based company said that an operating loss will be
likely because of cost increases and the expense of a sales
promotion for both domestic and overseas markets.

   The company paid a dividend totaling 8 yen (six cents) a
share during the prior full fiscal year.
   Fuji Heavy said it is in the process of restructuring
operations in order to boost performance.
