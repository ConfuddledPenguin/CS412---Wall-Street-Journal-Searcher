   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
were granted extensions of their exclusive right to come up
with reorganization plans until Feb. 28, 1991.
   The Campeau Corp. units filed for bankruptcy-court
protection on January 15.

   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. had already
extended the deadline to today.
   Once the so-called exclusivity period expires, Allied and
Federated's creditors may file their own reorganization plans
with the court.
   Federated and Allied told Judge Aug that they were not yet
ready to file the reorganization plan. But several creditor
committees filed responses and objections to the lengthy
extensions.
   Jay Indyke, a lawyer for the Allied creditors, said his
committee wanted the deadline extended only until Nov. 12.
"In spite of the fact that we've been told that the debtors
are moving toward {reorganization} plan negotiations . . .
were only seeing bits and pieces of it and we don't have a
complete picture of where they're going," he said.
   David Heiman, the lawyer who represents Allied and
Federated, could not be reached for comment.
   It is not unusual for the 120-day exclusivity period to be
extended several times in complex Chapter 11 proceedings.
