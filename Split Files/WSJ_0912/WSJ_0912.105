   In the search by Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A.,
Spain's troubled state-owned truck maker, to find a foreign
partner, Spanish hopes are growing that Daimler-Benz AG of
West Germany will acquire an 80% stake in Enasa.
   Spanish officials said they are optimistic an accord with
Daimler can be announced soon. A previous plan for Daimler to
acquire Enasa jointly with MAN AG of West Germany foundered
on competition objections by Bonn's cartel office. People
familiar with the Daimler talks said West Germany has said it
wouldn't object to Enasa's takeover by Daimler alone.

   In the negotiations, points under discussion include
government aid to Enasa. Daimler has asked for subsidies of
more than 60 billion pesetas ($603 million) in return for
taking over Enasa, which so far this year has had losses of
about seven billion pesetas. Spain earlier rejected the
subsidy sum as too high, as well as Daimler proposals for
sharp cuts in Enasa's work force to about 4,700 from 5,700.
Spain hopes for a takeover pact guaranteeing no layoffs, to
win union agreement.
