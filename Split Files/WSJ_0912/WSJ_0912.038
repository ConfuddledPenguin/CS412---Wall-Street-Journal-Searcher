   NEW YORK -- Stocks fell slightly as nervous investors kept
watch on oil prices, which remained above $30 a barrel, and a
rout in several technology issues.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.97 to 2612.62.
Stocks bounced around in an inverse relation to oil prices
throughout the day. Crude oil for October delivery rose above
$31, but closed down 54 cents to $30.76.

   Among the broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index dropped 0.59 to 321.04, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 0.31 to 176.39 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index lost 0.41 to 297.73. Declining issues topped
advancers by 835 to 609 on the Big Board.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to
113,220,000, the lightest since September 4 when 92,940,000
shares traded. Volume Monday totaled 119,730,000 shares.
   "The light trading volume of the past week shows there is
a tremendous lack of enthusiasm and uncertainty" among
investors, said Edward Shopkorn, general partner at Mabon,
Nugent &amp; Co. He said investors have three specific fears: a
war in the Mideast, which could result in an explosive rise
in oil prices and sharply falling stocks; a lack of progress
on trimming the budget deficit; and limited interest rate
reductions, if any, from the Federal Reserve.
   Meanwhile, investors received a reminder that earnings
growth is still a driving factor in the stock market: Tandem
Computers, which shocked investors with disappointing
third-quarter results in July, said it might not meet
fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Tandem's stock fell 2
1/8, or 15.6%, on 2.8 million shares, making it the most
active issue and the day's biggest loser on the Big Board in
percentage terms.
   Compaq Computer, which lowered resale prices by up to 20%
on more than a dozen desktop personal-computer models, fell 2
to 43 1/4 on 1.3 million shares. Other technology stocks that
came under pressure included Digital Equipment, which went
down 1 3/8 to 63 5/8; Cray Research, down 1 1/8 to 34 3/8;
Unisys, down 3/8 to 8 3/8; and Motorola, down 1 3/8 to 59 7/8
on 1.1 million shares.
   But Texas Instruments soared 3 1/2 to 29 1/8 as U.S.
market players learned of a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a
Japanese newspaper, that the company would seek $1.5 billion
in annual royalties under a Japanese patent for a basic
computer chip, known as a dynamic random access memory. The
company declined immediate comment on the report.
   International Business Machines, which lowered prices on
some of its Personal System/2 computers by 5% to 8%, also
managed to avoid being caught in the technology sector's
retreat. IBM rose 1 5/8 to 107 1/2 on 1.4 million shares.
   "IBM and Texas Instruments are up on stories; it is a
market of stocks right now," said Thomas Gallagher, managing
director in charge of institutional equity trading at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "In the old days, when Compaq, Digital and
Tandem broke it would have put a lot of selling pressure" on
all technology shares.
   Another possible reason for IBM's upturn may be that after
a sixth-place finish in 1989, the company appears ready to
seize the crown as this year's most profitable company in
terms of total earnings.
   IBM is estimated to have total after-tax net income of
$5.78 billion, or $10.10 a share, this year, making it the
most profitable company in a universe of 3,700 companies
tracked by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, a
division of Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan.
   Last year's winner was Exxon, which earned $4.75 billion,
or $3.66 a share; this year Exxon is expected to earn $4.78
billion, or $3.83 a share.
   Institutional Brokers says earnings estimates for the full
year show the following ranking of the top ten earners:
General Electric (3); Royal Dutch Petroleum (4); Philip
Morris (5); American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (6); General
Motors (7); Ford (8); Du Pont (9); and Chevron (10).
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber dropped 5/8 to 20 3/8. Moody's
Investors Service put the company's credit ratings under
review for a possible downgrade, citing concerns about the
company's profit outlook and other factors.
   Circuit City Stores dropped 1 3/8 to 15 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares. Salomon Brothers lowered its earnings estimate for
the fiscal year ending in February by 10 cents a share, to
$1.90, and for the following year by 20 cents a share, to
$2.20. However, Analyst Jack D. Seibald told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report that he continues to believe the
stock will outperform the market.
   Ralston Purina jumped 3 1/4 to 96 3/8. Analysts at several
brokerage houses raised their earnings projections after the
company said its sales volume and profit margins have
improved in key businesses. Also, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette raised the stock's investment rating from
"moderately attractive" to "very attractive."
   Georgia-Pacific fell 1 3/8 to 36 7/8 and traded as low as
36 1/2, a 52-week low, after Morgan Stanley downgraded the
stock to "sell" from "hold" and lowered its estimate for 1991
earnings to $3 a share from $3.70. The changes were made
after Morgan Stanley revised its U.S. economic forecast to a
"recession alert" from "slow growth," which led to downward
revisions in the firm's price forecasts for several grades of
paper, such as linerboard.
   Collins Foods International added 1/2 to 17 3/4 following
news of its plans to sell its Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurants to PepsiCo, the fast-food chain's parent, for
stock and to exchange its own shares for the 34% stake in
Sizzler Restaurants International it doesn't already own.
PepsiCo went up 1/4 to 25 1/8 on 1.5 million shares, while
Sizzler dipped 1/4 to 16 1/2 on the over-the-counter market.
   Bally Manufacturing rose 3/8 to 7 3/4 on a report that
investor Arthur Goldberg has accumulated nearly $15 million,
or 6%, of the company's common stock and plans to take an
active role, with the support of management, in strengthening
its operations.
   TransCanada PipeLines slipped 1 1/8 to 13 1/4 after BCE
agreed to sell its 48.8% stake in the company to a group of
Canadian investment firms for about 1.3 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.1 billion). BCE, whose holdings will be resold
to the public, added 1/8 to 30 7/8.
   Fluor, which reported that net income for the fiscal
quarter ended in July rose 18% from a year ago, went up 1 to
37. The latest results were on the high end of expectations.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.20
to 323.01. Volume totaled only 9,120,000 shares.
