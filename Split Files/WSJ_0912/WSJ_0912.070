   CHICAGO -- The defense fraud scandals of the 1980s made
villains of a lot of big companies, but a case here involving
Sundstrand Corp. shows that catching possible crooks in the
executive suite is lot more difficult.
   In 1988, the Rockford, Ill., aerospace contractor pleaded
guilty to defrauding the Pentagon and paid a $199 million
settlement -- the largest fine ever of its kind.

   Yet despite Sundstrand's own admission of criminal
wrongdoing, U.S. prosecutors have gotten bogged down trying
to find the executives who were behind the fraud. So far,
they've managed to bring charges against only three managers.
   None of the three indicted executives, whose trial began
here Monday, has a particularly high rank at Sundstrand. And
it seems highly unlikely that they alone could have
orchestrated the massive fraud Sundstrand itself
acknowledged.
   The highest-level executive charged, Joseph J. McCarthy,
was comptroller of the company's aviation unit. The other
defendants are his former employees, Ralph G. Hamann and Ray
John Chapel Jr. They are charged with conspiring to defraud
the government and making false statements.
   Current and former federal investigators, however, are now
saying that it's unlikely the inquiry will go any farther
than these three executives. The reasons: Investigators say
the government has had little success in "flipping" onetime
company middle-managers to testify against former superiors.
No documents that turned up have implicated higher-ups,
investigators say. And the complex Pentagon procurement
regulations led to an internal debate that seriously delayed
the investigation, pushing it up against the five-year
statute of limitations.
   The Sundstrand investigation "is not going past the three
individuals," said a federal lawman who was involved in the
case. "Maybe everybody {working on the case} got tired."
   The status of the Sundstrand investigation represents an
abrupt turnabout from prosecutors' initial optimism. In 1988,
Anton R. Valukas, then the government's top prosecutor in
Chicago, told a packed news conference that investigators
were scrutinizing officers of Sundstrand at all levels,
asserting that "there was an attitude on the part of many
within the company which permitted this to take place." At
the time, the judge in the case even referred to it as a
"sordid affair" and said executives of the company condoned
systematic efforts to "cheat, lie and steal" from the
government.
   Sundstrand, which sells aircraft generators and parts to
the Navy and Air Force through fixed-price contracts, pleaded
guilty to charges that it regularly underbid for government
business and then ran up millions of dollars in cost overruns
from 1980 through 1985 and charged them to the Defense
Department.
   The company charged the government for a wide range of
executives' personal expenses -- Steuben glassware, birthday
parties for officers, country-club fees and dog-kennel costs,
among them.
   The fraud scheme was carried out during the tenure of
Evans W. Erikson as Sundstrand's chairman and chief executive
officer. He retired at age 62 in December, 1988. His
successor as president and chief executive officer is Harry
C. Stonecipher, who joined the company from General Electric
Co. in 1987, after the fraud took place. Sundstrand declined
to comment on the case.
   A former prosecutor familiar with the case still holds out
hope that, if any of the three men on trial is convicted, he
might yet cooperate in a case involving the charges on which
the statute of limitations hasn't expired. But even this
former prosecutor concedes the chances of that appear slim.
   The government often faces obstacles like these in
pressing such complex accounting investigations toward the
indictment of executives, says Don Mancuso, the Defense
Department's assistant inspector general for investigations.
Top management sometimes institutes bonus programs for
cost-savings or finds other subtle means "to tell the
managers that the written procedures {demanded by the
government} don't have to be strictly enforced."
   One big headache faced by the prosecution in the current
case is the Defense Department's own in-fighting over what
accounting practices were illegal. Defense attorneys involved
in the Sundstrand investigation, but not in the current
trial, say the case could be difficult for the government to
win for this reason.
   The mischarging of cost overruns to taxpayers is at the
heart of the current trial, and the government contends
Messrs. McCarthy, Chapel and Hamann misstated to the
government just how company books were kept.
   But defense attorneys intend to argue that the accounting
practices were legal under confusing defense regulations that
the judge in the criminal trial terms "turgid, and very
difficult to comprehend."
   Government documents describe the intra-agency debate. In
a 1986 meeting, one criminal investigative report shows,
defense procurement official Paul Berg said the cost impact
of Sundstrand's accounting "was probably minimal and with
offsets may be a wash."
   But Michael McConnell, a Defense Department accountant who
played a key role in turning up the fraud, argued that there
were "great quantities of unallowable costs mischarged by
Sundstrand."
   There's also evidence that the government turned up hints
of the fraud about 15 years ago but failed to take action,
citing "little risk of loss to the Defense Department,"
according to a 1986 criminal investigative report.
