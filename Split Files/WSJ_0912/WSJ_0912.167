   NEW YORK -- There's a dividend drought in the stock
market.
   Dividend increases this year are down 21.7% through
August, setting the stage for one of the leanest years of
dividend growth since 1971, according to Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., which follows dividend practices of 7,000 companies.
Moreover, dividend cuts are up 42% through August, S&amp;P says,
and dividend omissions, while a relatively small number, are
up 86.5%.

   Dividend trends reflect corporate managements' outlook for
profits, and they currently point to a broad slowing of
corporate profit growth. That's bad news for the stock
market, particularly with "growth stocks" -- shares of
companies producing steady, above-average earnings increases
-- in vogue. As third quarter earnings reports come gushing
out in about a month, investors may be surprised to discover
that the profit slowdown has spread even to the reliable
growth companies, some analysts warn.
   "We are in a dividend recession," says Arnold Kaufman,
editor of S&amp;P's "Outlook" newsletter and follower of dividend
trends. "There are too few profits, and there's too much
debt."
   Dividends are how companies distribute a portion of their
earnings to shareholders. They are one of two ways investors
make money in stocks. Though price appreciation can deliver
potentially far larger payoffs, waning dividend growth can
substantially hurt long-term investors.
   Through August, S&amp;P says 904 companies of the 7,000 it
follows increased dividends, down from 1,155 last year. But
even this number of increases may be deceptive about the
overall trend. "Most of the increases are carryovers from
late in 1989," says George Boyd III, director of quantitative
research at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., "so the rate of dividend
increase next year will be minimal."
   The dividend drought is hitting small companies the
hardest, Mr. Kaufman says. That is one reason why small
stocks have performed much worse than large stocks this year.
   Many big companies whose stocks are in the S&amp;P 500 index
are still increasing dividends. S&amp;P expects the 500 stocks in
its index to collectively pay out $12 in dividends this year
compared with $11.05 last year, an increase of 8.6%. In 1989,
dividends grew 14% for the year, the highest growth rate
since 1977. Average annual dividend growth for the 500
companies is 6%.
   But Steven Einhorn, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., is alarmed at the slowing rate of dividend growth. "In
1991, we think dividend growth will be at about 5% on the S&amp;P
500," he says. Measured against Goldman's inflation forecast
of 5.5%, inflation-adjusted dividend "growth" will be -0.5%
in 1991. That would be the first time since 1984 that "real"
dividend growth turned negative. (Stocks were lackluster
investments in 1984: The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost
3.74%; the S&amp;P 500 index rose 1.4%.)
   "If we're right, the powerful dividend thrust of the
market is about to disappear," says Mr. Einhorn. That's one
reason he's bearish on stocks, he says.
   Dividends grew rapidly at the end of the 1980s. Companies
fending off corporate raiders courted shareholders with huge
one-time payouts. Also, robust business conditions allowed
dozens of companies to divide abundant cash to stockholders.
Now, takeovers are history and corporate profits are sagging.
   "Companies are going to be more tightfisted in sending
cash out while the future of the economy is uncertain," says
Geraldine Weiss, author of a book about an investment
strategy based on dividends called "Dividends Don't Lie."
Even so, Ms. Weiss says the stock market's recent fall has
enhanced the appeal of many stocks with histories of steadily
higher dividends.
   Among her recent favorites is American Business Products,
an office supplies company. In a recent newsletter, Ms. Weiss
notes that last year the company had a record profit and its
51st consecutive year of sales growth. Long-term debt is only
9.9% of total capital, Ms. Weiss points out, and the company
has increased dividends for 33 consecutive years at an
average annual rate of 15%. The stock has a relatively low
ratio of price to per-share earnings of about 10 compared
with 15 on the S&amp;P 500.
   Most important, Ms. Weiss says, the stock's dividend yield
is about 4.5%. Dividend yield is an expression of the current
annual dividend as a percentage of a stock's price. High
dividend yield means that a company is trading cheaply
compared to the amount it is paying out to shareholders. It's
an important measure of value in the stock market.
   Among other undervalued, high-yielding stocks Ms. Weiss
likes are Security Pacific Corp. (yielding 9.2%); business --
form printer John H. Harland Co. (yielding 3.6%); and Diebold
Inc. (yielding 3.9%), a maker of automated tellers and
security systems.
   Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and one of Wall Street's
foremost dividend watchers, has two warnings for investors
about the current dividend climate.
   When corporations protect dividends even though earnings
are weakening, retained earnings (net earnings minus dividend
payments) can tumble. "Retained earnings are going to jump
around a lot," Mr. Bernstein says. "And the volatility of
stock prices has a close relationship to the volatility of
retained earnings."
   And when earnings aren't zagging stock prices, expect a
zig from the bond market, Mr. Bernstein cautions. As dividend
growth stagnates, stocks become more like bonds and therefore
more sensitive to changes in interest rates.
   "Dividend growth is clearly a very important determinant
to what happens to the stock market," Mr. Bernstein says.
"And the case for dividend growth is a weak one."
