   PepsiCo Inc. agreed to buy 209 Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurants from Collins Foods International Inc. in a $122
million stock swap. The move furthers PepsiCo's strategy of
increasing control over the laggard fast-food chain.
   Separately, Collins Foods said its remaining operations --
after the sale of the U.S. Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants
-- will make an exchange offer to Sizzler Restaurants
International Inc. holders to acquire the 34% stake in
Sizzler that Collins doesn't already own.

   Analysts said the acquisition by Pepsi, which will boost
its Kentucky Fried Chicken unit's ownership of the U.S.
restaurants to 32% from 28%, will improve Pepsi's ability to
revitalize the chain. The purchase will also give the company
more leverage in dealing with sometimes-recalcitrant
franchisees, the analysts added.
   "The fewer franchisees, the better the control," said Roy
Burry, a beverage analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He said
the move will simplify company plans to swiftly upgrade
restaurants and introduce products. The purchase will also
give the company a bigger operating base, allowing it to reap
greater benefits from national marketing programs.
   Pepsi, the soft-drink, snack-food and restaurant company
based in Purchase, N.Y., will issue about 4.9 million common
shares to Collins's shareholders in the tax-free exchange, at
a ratio of about 0.216 share of PepsiCo common for each
Collins share held.
   Collins, which is based in Los Angeles, said completion of
the transaction is subject to approval by a majority of
Collins holders and various regulatory approvals. Collins
will continue to own and operate 64 Kentucky Fried
restaurants in Queensland, Australia, and will operate or
subfranchise 32 Sizzler restaurants in Australia.
   Pepsi has been eager to shore up the performance of its
lackluster Kentucky Fried Chicken chain, which hasn't fared
nearly as well as the company's Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
operations. One way to have more say over operations is to
own them. While Kentucky Fried Chicken will hold 32% of its
U.S. restaurants, both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell dominate their
chains by owning more than 50% of the outlets.
   In the agreement with Collins, which includes certain real
estate, Kentucky Fried Chicken is buying restaurants in
California, Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Kentucky Fried
Chicken said that for the year ended in April, the Collins's
Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants had average sales of
$620,000 for each restaurant compared with an average of
$608,000 for calendar 1989 at Kentucky Fried Chicken USA.
   Some franchisees were concerned about the sale. "We view
it very cautiously," said Robert Peck, past president of the
chain's franchisees' association. "We're concerned about the
company increasing control over some franchisees if they own
a majority." Mr. Peck said franchisees, who are battling the
company in court over, among other things, proposed terms of
a new contract, worry Kentucky Fried Chicken aims to buy up
all the highly profitable urban restaurants and to leave them
the low-volume rural outlets.
   Christopher R. Thomas, Collins's chief financial officer,
said the Kentucky Fried Chicken operations hadn't been for
sale before Collins received "an extremely attractive offer,"
from Pepsi. Selling the operations also will enable Collins
to focus its human and financial resources on its
faster-growing Sizzler restaurants, Mr. Thomas said.
   Collins's domestic Kentucky Fried Chicken operations
contributed about 23% of the company's $560.7 million in
revenue in fiscal 1990. Sizzler restaurants contributed about
60% of revenue and were "slightly" more profitable than the
Kentucky Fried Chicken stores, Mr. Thomas said. In the year,
the company had net income of $31.5 million, or $1.39 a
share.
   Collins's offer to acquire the 34% stake in Sizzler that
it doesn't already own is contingent upon the completion of
Collins's swap of the Kentucky Fried Chicken operations for
Pepsi stock, among other things. Sizzler expects to offer
1.25 shares of the restructured Collins for each of about 5.5
million Sizzler shares in public hands.
   Mr. Thomas said he couldn't place any value on the Collins
exchange offer. "The idea is to provide (Sizzler
shareholders) with a chance to receive a modest premium to
continue to participate in the business they invested in and
to own a stock that pays a dividend." Collins Foods paid a
dividend of 20 cents a share last year, whereas Sizzler
doesn't pay any dividend.
   Collins is one of Kentucky Fried Chicken's largest and
oldest franchisees. Collins's founder and chairman, James A.
Collins, started serving Kentucky Fried Chicken in his
hamburger restaurants about 30 years ago after meeting the
fried-chicken chain's founder Colonel Harland Sanders.
