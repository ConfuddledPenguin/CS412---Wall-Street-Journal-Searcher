   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co., still cool to an $857 million
hostile tender offer from Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co., said
it is negotiating to be acquired by a company it wouldn't
name.
   The embattled Kansas G&amp;E disclosed the talks in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also said it
would provide certain "non-public information" about itself
to Kansas City P&amp;L, giving that company a chance to revise
its $27-a-share offer. Kansas City P&amp;L has said its offer was
based on public information about Kansas G&amp;E and could
possibly be adjusted.

   In a letter to Kansas City P&amp;L President A. Drue Jennings,
Kansas G&amp;E Chairman Wilson K. Cadman offered the same
"information . . . provided by KG&amp;E to other third parties
who have expressed an interest in exploring certain
combinations with KG&amp;E or a purchase of KG&amp;E assets," subject
to confidentiality agreements. Mr. Cadman also informed Mr.
Jennings of the negotiations with the unidentified company
and added that, "moreover, the company may also enter into
negotiations with one or more other parties."
   A spokesman for Kansas G&amp;E wouldn't go beyond a company
statement about the filing.
   A spokesman for Kansas City Power &amp; Light said last night,
"It's an interesting development and we're anxious to talk to
them ourselves. We look forward to seeing the same
information that's being supplied to other parties."
   Kansas G&amp;E has spurned the Kansas City P&amp;L offer, calling
it inadequate and overly conditional and saying that it
"raises substantial and serious legal questions and numerous
uncertainties under state and federal statutes."
   But the $27-a-share offer still tops Kansas G&amp;E's recent
stock price. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Kansas G&amp;E closed yesterday at $24.50, down 37.5
cents. Kansas City P&amp;L rose 37.5 cents to $21.875 in Big
Board trading.
   Kansas City P&amp;L's offer, made in late July, is set to
expire Friday. As of Aug. 20, about 43% of Kansas G&amp;E's
common shares had been tendered.
