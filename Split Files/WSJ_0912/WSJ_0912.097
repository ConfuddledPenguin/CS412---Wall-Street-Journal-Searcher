   Salzburg, Austria -- It was business as usual at the 1990
Salzburg Festival, which came to an end last month. Conductor
Herbert von Karajan, who for three decades directed the
festival like an absolute monarch, died more than a year ago,
but his influence seems as omnipresent as ever -- at least
for now.
   When Karajan took over the festival in 1960, Salzburg had
long been the world's most prestigious musical showcase.
Thereafter it became in addition an obligatory part of the
international social whirl. After the conductor's death in
July 1989, word went out from the gossip columnists that
"nobody was going to Salzburg any longer." Nevertheless, this
year's festival was full of familiar types -- Austrian
nobles, German industrialists, French fashion designers.
There was even a sampling of affluent Americans, though the
depressed state of the dollar seemed to have thinned their
ranks somewhat.

   Money is an important consideration at Salzburg, where the
top price for opera tickets now is $330, and for orchestral
tickets $170. Jet-setters clearly find the expense
worthwhile. Even without the glamour conferred by Karajan's
presence, Salzburg continues to be one of the most
advantageous places in which to be seen, photographed and
gossipped about.
   Some music lovers also obviously find the place good value
-- since 1960 the festival has pitched its appeal to those
whose tastes run to standard works performed by brand-name
artists. Those seeking stimulation rather than reassurance no
doubt betake themselves to a different kind of festival.
   Not that the Salzburg program has ever been entirely
predictable. This year, for example, along with popular items
such as "Don Giovanni" and "Un Ballo in Maschera," the
schedule included a cycle of four concert-operas on the
subject of Orpheus by Monteverdi, Haydn, Ernst Krenek and
Gluck, only the last of which is a repertory work.
Nevertheless, most of the offerings were thrice familiar,
especially in the field of symphonic music. Had it not been
for the Kronos Quartet's brave concert featuring pieces by
contemporary composers, the chamber-music programs would have
been equally unchallenging.
   Every so often, of course, the familiar can prove
thrilling, especially in the hands of an artist more
dedicated to the composer than to self-advertisement. Take
the recital by Christa Ludwig. From a group of well-loved
songs by Schumann and Brahms, the mezzo soprano and her
sensitive accompanist, Charles Spencer, created a series of
memorable revelations about the diversity of human nature.
Fusing poetry and sound with a mastery equalled by no other
interpreter of lieder today, Ms. Ludwig was by turns
dramatic, witty, charming, dreamily introspective, soaringly
lyrical. At the age of 60, this great artist, who combines
profound interpretive insight with extraordinary vocal
warmth, is at the very peak of her powers, displaying a
spontaneity that renews the impact of everything she sings.
   For the most part, though, the musicmaking was less
searching. Sometimes, indeed, it was surprisingly slack and
sentimental, such as Claudio Abbado's performance of
Bruckner's Fourth Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic. More
often it was simply slick, such as Sir Georg Solti's reading
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the same orchestra.
Sentimentality is hardly a charge one could level against Sir
Georg. Neither is interpretive commitment. For many years
now, the conductor has evinced more interest in creating an
effect of high-powered nervous tension than in achieving
interpretive insight.
   In the latter respect, at any rate, he is the natural
successor to Karajan, whose astounding proficiency as a
master of orchestral sound was unaccompanied by any sense of
ulterior musical purpose. It's hardly surprising that when
Karajan died shortly before the opening of last year's
festival, Sir Georg agreed to save the day by assuming the
great man's obligations. A household name and a prolific
recording artist, Sir Georg has helped to perpetuate the
conviction that only a glamorous star conductor can ensure
the continued success of Salzburg.
   As he demonstrated by taking over Karajan's 1989
production of "Un Ballo in Maschera," he fits right into the
Salzburg mold. A typical Grammy Award winner, Sir Georg in
"Un Ballo in Maschera" alternated between blandness and
hysteria, the former allowing the audience to relax, the
latter -- which usually manifested itself at the end of a
scene -- to sit up and clap vociferously.
   Riccardo Muti, who took over Karajan's 1987 "Don
Giovanni," achieved more solid musical results than Karajan
had ever done. Though hindered by Michael Hampe's lifeless
production and by his own uncertain taste in singers, Mr.
Muti nonetheless interpreted the opera as a drama of weight
and substance, and not as a sequence of pretty numbers.
   That something more genuine can manifest itself in
Salzburg was demonstrated by the San Francisco Symphony,
which after a checkered history has recently achieved world
status under the Swedish-American conductor, Herbert
Blomstedt. In Bruckner's Fifth Symphony, Mr. Blomstedt
offered an instructive contrast to Mr. Abbado's reading of
the same composer's Fourth Symphony two days before. While
the Viennese emphasized emotionality at the expense of
accuracy and structure, the San Franciscan found an excellent
balance between precision and feeling. The American orchestra
may not be able to summon forth the sheer tonal beauty of its
Viennese counterpart, but it offered the more satisfying
artistic results.
   The changes that are imminent under the festival's
director-designate, Gerard Mortier, will in all likelihood
affect more than music. Salzburg, which has little or no art
of world quality to offer the festival public, may be one of
several venues to display selections from the collection of
New York's Guggenheim Museum. Plans still are tentative, but
Austrian architect Hans Hollein already has designed a
building which, like the two festival opera houses, would be
carved out of the mountain that dominates the city. Sketches,
plans, even a model, were on view at the Residenz Gallery
here, along with a group of 40 works from the Guggenheim by
Chagall, Delaunay, Kandinsky, Leger, Marc and Picasso. As
with all of the many brainchildren of Guggenheim director
Thomas Krens, sources of funding are still uncertain. But
even without a great art collection for its magic mountain,
Salzburg's music festival seems destined to pass through
profound change in short order.
