   Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. President and Chief Executive
Officer Bruce Karatz said he "feels more comfortable" with
the lower end of analysts' estimates of fiscal 1990 earnings
of $1.60 to $1.90 a share.
   Mr. Karatz, speaking at a Montgomery Securities investment
conference in San Francisco, said revenue for the year ending
Nov. 30 will exceed $1.3 billion and that pretax profit
should plunge to around $90 million.

   For 1989, the homebuilder, based in Los Angeles, reported
what Mr. Karatz called "phenomenal" pretax earnings of $142.8
million, or $2.44 a share after taxes. Mr. Karatz said
California's real estate market was at "near recessionary
levels" but that the company's operations in France are
strong, and will produce roughly half of the company's 1990
revenue and operating profit.
