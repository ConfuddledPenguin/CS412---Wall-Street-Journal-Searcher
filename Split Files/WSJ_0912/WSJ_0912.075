   Haywire Digital Clocks
   Are Alarming Utilities

   THE PROBLEM of blinking digital clocks has caught the eye
of the utility-supported Electric Power Research Institute.
   Power outages, even for a moment, can cause digital clocks
on microwave ovens, videocassette recorders and bedside
tables to revert to 12:00 and to start blinking, indicating
they need to be reset. Owners then have to roam through the
house resetting them, often by complicated procedures.
   The problem "represents an increasing source of friction
between utilities and their customers," says a recent issue
of the EPRI Journal. For a Florida utility, subjected to
several split-second outages a day from lightning, blinking
clocks were the No. 1 complaint, the journal reports.
   A year ago, EPRI put a team of engineers on the problem.
It found that older digital clocks, produced in the 1970s,
resist the blinking problem because they have relatively
large capacitors, which store enough electricity to tide the
clock over for outages as long as 10 seconds. The smaller
capacitors on newer clocks can't deal with outages longer
than a fraction of a second. Many newer clocks have space for
backup batteries, but customers rarely buy them because the
clocks work without batteries.
   Rechargeable batteries or the addition of a low-power
electronic memory with an automatic reset button would solve
the problem. But makers of digital clocks, all of whom are in
Asia, probably would balk at the extra costs, the researchers
conclude. A forthcoming report, EPRI says, will advise
utilities on how to modulate customer ire by discussing the
problem in inserts to the monthly bill and other gambits.
                                                                                                       

   Drunken Driver Warnings
   Fall Flat in Taprooms
                                                                                                       

   APPEALS such as "if you drink, don't drive" are unlikely
to work, a psychology experiment in Canada found.
   To see how alcohol affects moral judgments, two
psychologists at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British
Columbia, toured local bars and parties. They gave drinkers
who volunteered a standard test involving hypothetical moral
dilemmas, such as mercy killings, and then asked them about
the morality of driving after drinking. The volunteers agreed
to take on-the-spot breathalyzer tests and to come to the
university a week later to be interviewed on drinking habits.
   When sober at the second interview, most volunteers were
more mature in their judgements about drinking and driving
than they had been a week earlier. They said that driving
after drinking was wrong, and that they were less likely than
other people to do so. Yet, "every subject but one who had
driven to a bar or party drove home, however impaired," the
psychologists report. The breathalyzer test showed that 12 of
the 26 drinkers who drove home were legally impaired.
   "This finding was surprising because these subjects had
just been interviewed about the values of life and law and
the wrongfulness of impaired driving, had been given the
results of a breathalyzer test and had been cautioned about
the effects of driving while impaired," Katy Denton and
Dennis Krebs say in the August issue of the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.
   The findings "suggest that high-level moral appeals made
to people when they are sober will not constrain their
behavior when they are drunk," they conclude. To be
effective, "appeals directed toward sober people should
encourage them to take precautions ahead of time, before they
become intoxicated," they suggest.
                                                                                                       

   Cut Your Blood Pressure
   By Changing Armbands
                                                                                                       

   THE NATION'S high blood pressure problem might be sharply
reduced by a simple change in blood pressure measuring
devices, the editors of the Lancet suggest.
   In an editorial, the journal cites a study recently
published in England concerning blood pressure measurements
using the sphygmomanometer, the device involving a cuff
that's wrapped around the arm and then inflated to gain a
blood pressure reading. The study compared pressure readings
with the standard cuff that many manufacturers supply with
the machine against readings with a larger cuff.
   The larger cuff was designed so that the inflatable part,
the bladder, was long enough to wrap around at least 80% of
the arm's circumference. This is the size recommended by the
American Heart Association and the British Hypertension
Association because they say it's more accurate.
   The larger cuff gave lower pressure readings than the
standard cuffs supplied with the sphygmomanometers, the study
found. "Whilst the differences may be small, the researchers
point out that if the larger cuff were adopted it would
substantially reduce the numbers of patients committed to
treatment," the editorial notes.
   The journal estimated that in England and Wales, some
300,000 people would no longer be regarded as having mild
high blood pressure if the larger cuff were substituted for
the standard cuff. A 1988 American Heart Association report
indicates a similar problem exists in the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SCIENTISTS at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton,
N.Y., will take samples of limestone from 50 French quarries
and 2,000 French medieval sculptures and bombard them with
neutrons. The resulting radioactivity should help tell which
quarry was the source of stone for each sculpture. . . . A
University of Illinois entomologist, checking literature on
American Indian herbal medicine, found that the Indians had
correctly identified a dozen plants as being toxic to
intestinal worms.
