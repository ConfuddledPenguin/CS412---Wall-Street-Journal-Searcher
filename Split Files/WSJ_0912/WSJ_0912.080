   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Airline passengers bumped from
overbooked flights can turn down the free tickets and refunds
they're offered and sue for damages, a federal appeals court
ruled.
   In a case from Montana, a three-judge panel of the Ninth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a federal ban on direct
state regulation of airlines does not prevent a passenger
from suing under ordinary state law for harm caused by
airline practices.

   The ruling allows William D. West, a Helena, Mont., patent
lawyer, to pursue a suit against Northwest Airlines for
selling tickets that cannot be exchanged or refunded but are
subject to bumping when flights are overbooked. West is
seeking punitive damages.
   "Selling nonrefundable tickets limits a traveler's ability
to make changes but not the airline's ability . . . to switch
to a smaller-size aircraft, increasing the chances of
bumping," said attorney Cornish Hitchcock of the Public
Citizen Litigation Group, a Ralph Nader organization that
helped represent West.
   The right to sue for overbooking was established in a 1976
Supreme Court decision, a case that started when Allegheny
Airlines bumped Nader from a Washington-to-Hartford flight.
In Tuesday's ruling, the appeals court said the federal
deregulation of airlines in 1978 did not prohibit all such
suits.
   The airline was studying the ruling Tuesday and had no
comment, said its lawyer, Jon Metropoulos.
