   Abitibi-Price Inc., a Toronto-based newsprint concern,
said the Canadian Paperworkers Union broke off contract
talks, as a strike at seven of the company's paper mills
continued.
   An Abitibi official said the union ended negotiations in
Toronto and indicated it will ask its members to vote on the
company's latest offer. Union officials were traveling and
couldn't be reached for comment.

on strike Monday, shutting down about 7% of North American
newsprint capacity.
   Separately, the Quebec &amp; Ontario Paper Co. unit of Tribune
Co., Chicago, said workers at its newsprint mill in Baie
Comeau, Quebec, ratified a new three-year contract. The unit
said a strike at its Thorold, Ontario, mill continued.
