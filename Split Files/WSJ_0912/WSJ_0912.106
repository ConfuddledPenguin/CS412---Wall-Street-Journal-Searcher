   NEW YORK -- The dollar bounced back against the yen,
partly on technical buying and partly because Japanese
investors eased up on their yen purchases.
   The dollar had fallen below 140 yen Monday on a big move
by Japanese institutions to convert their foreign-currency
profits into yen. The move was part of an attempt by the
institutions to dress up their balance sheets before their
fiscal first half closes Sept. 30.

   But this pressure slackened yesterday, even as buying by
investors searching for arbitrage profits propped up the
dollar.
   The yen's fall allowed profit-takers to step into the yen
cross market in late North American trading to buy back
recently sold currencies, such as the mark and the pound.
   This cross trading gave the dollar an additional lift
against the yen but took back some of the greenback's earlier
gains against European currencies. Cross trading helps the
dollar because the U.S. currency often serves as a medium for
transactions in other currencies. For example, investors
trading marks for yen will often pass through dollars to take
advantage of the broader dollar market.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
140.30 yen, up from 139.55 yen late Monday in New York. The
currency was also changing hands at 1.5855 marks, up from
1.5820 marks in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at
$1.8580, up from $1.8575.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 139.10 yen, down from 139.85 yen at the close there
Tuesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5900 marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5828 marks.
   The mark rose to 88.489 yen from 88.211 yen previously,
while the pound gained to 260.68 yen from 259.21 yen.
   Receiving some of the strongest support from profit-takers
was the Canadian dollar, which climbed to 86.12 U.S. cents
from 85.71 cents.
   The technical buying that gave the dollar its initial lift
had its origins in the currency's New York close above 1.58
marks Monday, according to Jerry Egan, Bank of Boston's chief
dealer. Technicians had predicted that such a closing quote
would indicate enough positive sentiment to take the dollar
to 1.61 marks.
   Added to this was significant dollar buying by Kuwaitis
and Saudis, as well as Malaysia's Bank Negara, traders said.
   But there was a brief dollar sell-off in the late New York
morning that carved half a pfennig and half a yen from the
dollar. Many traders pointed to a report that ran across
newswires about 10 a.m. in New York, in which the U.S.
General Accounting Office warned Congress that "35 large
banks . . . are likely to fail or require assistance within
the next year."
   That, the congressional watchdog agency estimated, would
cost the already-strapped Bank Insurance Fund between $4.4
billion and $6.3 billion.
   But Mr. Egan said currency dealers soon realized that the
news headline gave a false impression of the seriousness of
the report. For one thing, the phrase, "35 large banks," was
misinterpreted as the 35 largest banks in the U.S.
   The dollar recovered its losses in little over an hour.
   Also providing an excuse to sell dollars before noon in
New York was a rumor, seemingly confined to U.S. markets,
that the Bundesbank would defend the dollar's 1.6 mark level
in order to hold down the price of imported oil, which is
denominated in dollars.
   But the mark came under pressure as Bonn agreed late
yesterday to pay about 12 billion marks to the Soviet Union
to help finance the move over the next four years of the
370,000 Soviet troops stationed in East Germany. That news
follows reports that the unification and reconstruction of
East Germany will require a total of some 1.2 trillion marks
over the next five years. On top of that are demands that
West Germany contribute to the multinational force in the
Middle East.
   In London, the dollar ended firm. However, it fell back
late in the day from its higher levels earlier, as traders
trimmed long-dollar positions.
   In Tokyo, the dollar ended higher Tuesday, boosted by a
correction against the yen. The U.S. currency closed at
139.85 yen, above 139.43 yen late Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $380.50 an ounce, up $1.90. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $382.55 an
ounce.
