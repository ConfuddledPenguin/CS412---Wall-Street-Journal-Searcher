   CHICAGO -- Soybean futures prices rose for a second
consecutive day on a report of record demand for soybean meal
coupled with diminishing world soybean production.
   Analysts said an article in a German publication, Oil
World, reported that world soybean meal consumption between
January and September reached an all-time high. Soybean meal
often is used as feed for poultry and cattle and is a
component of many foods produced for human consumption.

   Purchases of soybean meal by the Soviet Union, generally a
big buyer, have been somewhat smaller than usual, so an
overall increase in world soybean meal use would be doubly
significant, analysts said. "Even without the Soviets,
consumption was up, so the market took that to be a very
encouraging sign," said Anne Frick, soybean analyst for
Prudential-Bache in New York.
   The effect of increased demand for soybean meal on futures
prices was heightened by diminishing world production of
soybeans, particularly by soybean growers Brazil and
Argentina. The market also reacted to a U.S. Agriculture
Department crop ratings report released late Monday that
traders said showed hot weather in the Mississippi Delta
growing region had hurt the developing soybean crop. "That
confirmed a general decline in yield prospects for the U.S.
crop," said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst for Merrill Lynch
in New York. One Chicago weather forecaster's Monday
prediction of possible frost in the northern Midwest this
weekend appeared to be isolated; no other forecasts mentioned
frost.
   Other factors influencing the market yesterday included
speculation on the contents of an Agriculture Department crop
production report due out after trading today. Most analysts
expect the department's soybean crop estimate for the 1990
growing season to be practically unchanged, perhaps down
slightly to about 1,835,000,000 bushels from last month's
figure of 1,836,000,000 bushels. Because of the past two
weeks' hot, dry weather in the South, traders will adjust the
department's crop figures downward. So it will be hard for
the report to exert anything but upward pressure on futures
prices, analysts said.
   Underlying the two days of price rallies in soybean
futures is persistent speculation that the U.S. may offer
credit to the Soviet Union for grain purchases from U.S.
farmers. However, analysts downplayed rumors that such a
package would be announced soon. "President Bush has other,
more pressing issues in front of him," one analyst said.
Though Middle East tensions didn't play a major role in
yesterday's soybean futures price increase, analysts said
events there will continue to support grain futures prices
generally as long as the region is in a crisis.
   The soybean futures contract for November delivery rose 6
1/2 cents a bushel yesterday to settle at $6.3875 a bushel.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed lower yesterday in
moderate trading marked by a late sell-off. "Aggressive
buying on expectations of military action {in the Persian
Gulf region} late yesterday and earlier today" pushed prices
higher, said John Hill, a broker at Merrill Lynch Futures
Inc. Technical factors provoked additional buying, but as the
price approached $32 a barrel, interest dissipated. October
light sweet crude finished trading at $30.76 a barrel, down
54 cents. Activity was fairly light, with traders showing
little conviction. The only piece of fresh news to affect
price levels yesterday came around midafternoon when the U.S.
Defense Department said Iraqi troops were observed moving
along that country's border near Syria and Turkey. While a
spokesman for the Defense Department said hostilities weren't
thought to be imminent along those borders, crude oil futures
popped to intraday highs. They later declined, however. And
prices are unlikely to get a boost from inventory statistics
released by the American Petroleum Institute late yesterday.
The figures showed that all oil stocks -- crude, gasoline and
heating oil -- increased last week.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were steady. The most actively
traded December contract ended with a gain of 0.25 cent a
pound at $1.2855. However, the soonest-to-expire September
delivery, which is reflecting concern over relatively small
supplies of copper available for delivery against a large
number of outstanding contracts, rose one cent a pound to
$1.3480. The stronger advance for September widened the
premium for that month over December by 0.75 cent to 6.25
cents. Strong speculative demand for futures contracts
developed in London. "It was well absorbed and had little
impact, price-wise, on the market. As a result, New York
failed to move much also," an analyst said. Negotiations
continued in the mine strike in Peru and speculation
continued that the dispute may be settled this week, analysts
said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with gold and
silver rising while platinum continued weak. December
delivery gold ended with a gain of $1.80 an ounce at $386.60.
December silver advanced two cents an ounce to $4.87. October
platinum dropped to a new life-of-contract low, $448.50, for
the second consecutive day, then partially recovered to
settle at $452.80, down $4.70. What support there was in gold
was mostly derived from a rally in crude oil from its lows
early in the session, according to one analyst. He noted that
gold was also helped when the dollar late in the day gave up
some of its gains. Platinum's industrial character is working
against it, especially with the slowing U.S. economy, the
analyst said. A great disappointment to traders, he said, was
that the Middle Eastern crisis has failed to touch off any
significant investor buying of platinum in Japan, where it is
the favorite precious metal.
