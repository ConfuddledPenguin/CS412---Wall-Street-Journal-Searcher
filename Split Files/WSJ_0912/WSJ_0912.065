   WARSAW -- If you don't own a Polish vacuum cleaner yet,
Adam Parys thinks you ought to check out the Zelmer Compact
Type 800.
   Mr. Parys heads Zelmer Mechanized Household Equipment
Works, Poland's biggest -- and only -- vacuum cleaner maker.
In the thick of his first capitalist recession, he got up off
his central plan and stuck his foot in the door of the
Western world.

   With special recesses for accessory storage, ergonomic
hose handle and foot-operated cord winder, the Compact 800
tops the Zelmer line. Mr. Parys awards it Poland's highest
accolade: "It's average," he says. "It's no different from
any vacuum cleaner made in France or England or Japan."
   A well-fed man in a gray suit, Mr. Parys has come to
Warsaw from the Zelmer plant in Rzeszow for a meeting in his
export agent's office. "You want to buy and I want to sell,"
he says. "So not only is it a good vacuum cleaner, it's also
cheap."
   "Not cheap," his trade director interrupts. "Inexpensive."
   Maybe it isn't the slickest pitch of all time, but it
sells. Zelmer's exports westward have jumped 20% this year,
and the company has company. Having predicted a hard-currency
trade deficit of $800 million for 1990, Poles now gawk in
amazement at a surplus that is $2.5 billion and rising. The
zloty is strong. The $1 billion set aside for emergencies by
the International Monetary Fund sits untouched.
   An honest exchange rate has made anything Polish a bargain
for foreigners this year, and anything foreign more costly to
Poles. But that isn't the whole story. As Poland leaps toward
capitalism, some managers, including communist warhorses such
as Mr. Parys, have had character transplants. With their
guaranteed home market killed by an austerity-borne
recession, they have turned into salesmen.
   Exports are up in shoes, fabric, furniture, lighting,
machinery, leather, berries, mushrooms and chickens. "You
can't say Poland is an exporting power," Marek Gucik, an
export promoter at the foreign trade ministry, says. "But
enterprises that never sold in the West before are finding
buyers there."
   But they will have to find a lot more. Just as Poland and
the other newly free nations of Europe have opened their
sample cases on capitalism's front porch, their old customers
in the Soviet Union have kicked them onto the sidewalk. The
Soviets' trade bloc, Comecon, is washed up. Without it, this
year's unexpected surplus may be doomed to become next year's
unavoidable deficit.
   The Cold War's end has its advantages, too. Hungary owes
its good trading luck to a tide of Western tourists. Zelmer's
arch rival, East Germany, is vanishing from the map -- and
from world-wide vacuum cleaner competition, as well. Another
Polish company recently changed its name to "North," for ease
of Western pronunciation, and won a contract to make uniforms
for West Germany's navy.
   East Germany's disappearance, however, also will eliminate
its former bloc partners' second-biggest market. Their
biggest, the Soviet Union, is going broke. Moscow's reneging
on oil deliveries is more of a shock to its former empire
than this summer's rising oil prices.
   Iraq owes Poland 750,000 tons of oil as part payment for
$500 million in Polish military hardware. The Poles won't get
paid for all their goods, and will have to buy the oil
elsewhere, for a total short-term loss of about $300 million.
But the Soviets owe them much more: 12.7 million tons, 85% of
Poland's annual oil need, priced not in dollars but in
Comecon's cheap, ruble-based funny money.
   Their oil industry a wreck, the Soviets have cut their
shipments in half, teaching Poland and the rest of the old
bloc that political freedom hasn't come close to ending
economic dependence. To choke off demand, the Czechoslovaks
have raised fuel prices 50%. In late August, the Poles raised
theirs 30%.
   Poland's other recession-pummeled Soviet imports have
crashed, too, producing another trade surplus, this one in
the East. But a surfeit of funny money is useless to Poland's
economic remodelers, even though it accounts for half the
country's trade. So they have arbitrarily halved the exchange
rate, tromping down the value of the rubles brought home by
the numerous Polish companies with wares that have rarely
found buyers outside the Soviet Union.
   One of these is Bumar-Warynski, maker of the K-406A1
hydraulic excavator with externally toothed, tapered roller
slew bearing. This item -- and its sludger bucket, ripper and
stone grapple -- is built with much clanging and drilling in
a dingy shed on the edge of Warsaw. In a dingy office block
next door, Jozef Kowalczyk is in a bad mood.
   "Our problem is profitability," Mr. Kowalczyk, the acting
director, says. (The director resigned.) "We're down 30%," he
says. "But our problems will become acute on Jan. 1." On that
day, Comecon will burn its funny money and start trading for
dollars. Having forbidden this for 40 years, the Soviets are
itching for it. The old bloc, having dreamed of it, is
terrified.
   "Enterprises in the Soviet Union don't know how they will
get dollars from the state," Mr. Kowalczyk says. "They don't
know how much they will have. In the Soviet Union, everything
is needed, but they won't have the money to buy. Our trade
volume must drop."
   Prices, too. Appraised honestly in dollars, Mr.
Kowalczyk's sludger buckets won't buy nearly as much Soviet
oil as they used to. Neither will the 10 million tons of coal
Poland sends the Soviets each year. Add an oil price increase
to their 1991 energy bill, and the Poles could come up short
by as much as $2.5 billion.
   So much for 1990's surplus. Much as they cling to the
distant hope of a rich Soviet market, many an eastward
exporter could go bust by next year. Dozens of high-cost coal
mines are sure to fail. With less coal and fewer excavators
to pay for Soviet oil, Poles will be under pressure to earn
dollars by pushing products in the West. This is where the
vacuum cleaner salesmen come in.
   "I have 17 people writing letters, sending samples,
mailing catalogs -- to everywhere," Andrzej Guk, head export
agent for the Zelmer vacuum cleaner, says. "We're looking for
big contracts."
   Tall and suave, Mr. Guk worked in Raleigh, N.C., from 1981
to 1987 at a company that dealt in one of Poland's top
exports to the U.S., electric golf carts. Mr. Guk himself
sold sewing machines. His greatest success was breaking into
the 1988 J.C. Penney catalog.
   Now Mr. Guk is back in Warsaw at Universal Co., a state
trading company and the first in Poland to try selling shares
to the public. In an office under renovation, redolent of new
paint and furniture, he is pumping up the Zelmer account.
   He woos the French and the Italians away from the East
Germans, buttonholes anybody who buys from Yugoslavia or
South Korea, dangles discounts before Portugal and Brazil.
Rare among Polish companies, Zelmer has invested in a new
electric-engine plant to give it enough vacuum cleaner volume
to assault the U.S.
   "It's not easy to get to J.C. Penney direct from the
street," Mr. Guk says, but he figures the sewing machine coup
gives him an opening. True, Americans favor upright vacuum
cleaners over compacts. On the other hand, to help destroy
communism, the U.S. did away with the duty on Polish
appliances. So the price is right.
   Mr. Guk has a man in Rutherford, N.J., working on it. If
Penney won't bite, he'll be knocking on Wal-Mart's door next.
