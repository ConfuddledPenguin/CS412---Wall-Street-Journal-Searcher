   LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said it established a
$9.3 million reserve that will result in a charge of $6.1
million, or 13 cents a share, in the third quarter. The
reserve will cover weather-related losses for its
property-casualty and reinsurance segments.
   The company cited substantial claims created by a recent
tornado that devastated several Chicago suburbs, as well as
hail and windstorms in the Denver area.
