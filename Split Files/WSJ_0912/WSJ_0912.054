   A New York investment partnership said it raised its stake
in Kinark Corp., based in Tulsa, Okla., to 8.8%, even as the
group weighs a second offer for the owner of galvanizing
plants and chemical-storage facilities.
   Although Kinark directors rejected an offer last May of $7
a share by Steel Partners L.P., it has continued to talk to
the group. Last Friday, Kinark agreed to open its books to
the partnership. Stuart Freedman, a spokesman for the
investors, declined to discuss the possibility of a bid.
"We're just beginning the process," he said.
