   CHICAGO -- Bally Manufacturing Corp. said investor Arthur
M. Goldberg has bought a 5.4% stake in the company, and plans
to work with management to boost the value of the casino and
health-club company.
   Mr. Goldberg, who has bought 1,586,300 Bally common shares
for about $15 million through a family partnership, agreed to
limit any future purchases to no more than 15% of Bally's
stock. The Somerset, N.J., investor is chairman, president
and chief executive of Di Giorgio Corp., a food wholesaler
and building-products maker.

   Mr. Goldberg, who has bought stakes in Bally in the past
and sold them at a profit, said that he invested in Bally
because he considers it undervalued. He wasn't immediately
available for further comment.
   Robert E. Mullane, Bally's chairman, said the company has
agreed to support Mr. Goldberg's election to the board. He
praised Mr. Goldberg's track record, and added that Mr.
Goldberg's partnership will file a 13-D statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Bally's stock, which had been sagging at around $6 a share
in recent weeks, jumped 37.5 cents yesterday, to close at
$7.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
company's stock has eroded substantially over the past year
as the market pummeled casino stocks, and investors feared
Bally's erratic earnings and hefty debt load of $1.8 billion.
   Bally operates four casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., and
Nevada and the nation's largest chain of health clubs. It is
also engaged in gaming equipment and systems, exercise
equipment and lottery products and services. Mr. Mullane had
recently announced plans to lighten Bally's debt load by
trying to sell or spin off the health clubs.
   Analysts said they were uncertain what Mr. Goldberg's role
would be with the company. "It's not clear why anyone would
want to buy into it," said Richard J. Byrne, a high-yield
analyst with Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith who has
been harshly critical of Bally's high leverage and other
problems.
