   NEW YORK -- Nearly two-thirds of U.S. companies that
export are optimistic about gaining higher overseas sales in
the next 12 months, a survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. shows.
   In June, the financial data and services concern
interviewed 5,000 of the nation's largest export companies.
According to the survey, 64% of the firms expect their sales
to increase, 33% expect sales to remain unchanged and 3%
predict a decline.

   Among the firms with high expectations, 71% said they
expect to increase exports to Western Europe, 52% to Japan
and almost 30% predicted that they plan to boost exports to
Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union.
   Joseph W. Duncan, D&amp;B corporate economist and chief
statistician, said it appears from the survey that the
increase will come only from companies that already are
exporting. That trend "implies that if the export boom is to
continue, long-term policies are needed to encourage
nonexporters to participate in international trade," he said.
   D&amp;B said an earlier survey accurately predicted that 1989
exports would be weak compared with 1988.
