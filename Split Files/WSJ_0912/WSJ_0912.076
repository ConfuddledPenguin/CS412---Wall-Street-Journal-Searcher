   ZURICH, Switzerland -- The largest bank syndicate in
Switzerland, which dominates the country's bond market, will
be dissolved, probably at the end of the year, according to a
spokeswoman for Swiss Bank Corp.
   However, a Swiss Big Bank syndicate statement by Union
Bank of Switzerland, or UBS, gave no indication that any
decision had been made. It said an announcement would be made
Sept. 26, but did not specify the subject. Swiss Bank Corp.,
UBS and Credit Swiss are the dominant members of the
syndicate; a number of smaller banks also belong to the
group.

   The development follows -- but goes far beyond -- a
government decree this week ordering the abolition of several
cartel-like agreements in the banking industry. The
dissolution of the syndicate would mean that smaller, rival
syndicates will have better opportunities in the bond market.
   A bank researcher said the change was sooner than expected
and that small and foreign banks will compete better, but
noted that the placing power of big banks will always be
needed.
   On Monday, Swiss Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz
ordered the syndicate to drop by the end of the year a
so-called loyalty clause that prevents members of the
syndicate from joining outside underwriting houses.
   Jules Keller, a board member of Big Bank rival Warburg
S.G. Banque Soditic SA, said ending the syndicate goes much
further than abolishing the loyalty clause. The loyalty
clause, however, was the main problem, he said.
   The syndicate controls between 75% and 80% of the Swiss
franc foreign bond market by banning members from joining
other groups.
