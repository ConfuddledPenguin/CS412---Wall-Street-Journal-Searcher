   WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department warned U.S.
consumers to brace themselves for a double jolt of food-price
inflation this year and next because of the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Energy-price increases stemming from war jitters and the
international embargo against Iraq already are beginning to
drive up costs of growing, processing and distributing food,
the department said. Most of the oil-price shock in the food
sector, however, is expected to be felt in the first half of
1991.

   Department analysts said they expect food prices to
average 5% to 7% higher this year than in 1989, a two
percentage-point jump from the department's December 1989
prediction. The increase reflects not only the economic
repercussions of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait but also
unrelated double-digit price increases on fresh fruit, pork,
eggs and dairy products in the first half of 1990. Last year,
food prices climbed 5.8%, the sharpest increase since 1981.
   The food-inflation forecast for 1991 won't be issued until
November, but department analysts projected that oil prices
alone will boost food prices 1% to 2% next year, primarily
through higher transportation costs. However, they added that
a further economic slowdown would relieve some of the upward
pressure on food prices.
   At the same time, problems are brewing in the Farm Belt.
Department analysts project a $1.7 billion jump in farm
production costs if crude oil prices remain at $30 a barrel
through 1991, and a $2.6 billion jump if oil hits $40 a
barrel. Although farmers could find some savings by changing
their production practices, net farm income is likely to drop
in 1991, they said.
   The department hasn't yet issued its farm-income forecast
for next year. For this year, it is sticking with its
forecast that income will be between $47 billion and $52
billion, compared with $47 billion last year. So far, while
the Persian Gulf crisis has led to higher fuel costs, it
hasn't had much effect on the cost of fertilizers and other
chemicals used in agriculture.
   The department played down the impact of the trade embargo
against Iraq on global trade. "Iraq is a small enough country
that the embargo will have only a limited effect on world
trade and U.S. exports," the department said in a background
paper released yesterday. Although Iraq relied on imports for
75% of its food, its purchases accounted for only a small
fraction of the world's agricultural trade.
   Nonetheless, losing 1.4 million tons of Iraqi wheat
purchases -- more than 1% of the world market -- hurt the
wheat market, where prices already were depressed by the
prospect of bumper grain crops in the Northern Hemisphere and
reduced Soviet and Chinese demand for imported wheat.
   The Agriculture Department, under pressure from lawmakers
from wheat-producing states to shore up prices, said it has
been making full use of its export-subsidy and
credit-guarantee programs. Under the Export Enhancement
Program, exporters sell U.S. grain at world market prices and
collect so-called bonuses from the government to make up the
difference between U.S. prices and the lower world market
prices.
   In the past three months, the department has paid bonuses
covering 2.6 million tons of wheat, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said yesterday in a letter to Rep. Dan
Glickman (D., Kan.), who has faulted the administration for
not being aggressive enough with the program.
   "This is several times what we had done at this time a
year ago, notwithstanding abysmal buyer interest," Mr.
Yeutter said. "Recent bonuses are far higher than those of a
year ago."
