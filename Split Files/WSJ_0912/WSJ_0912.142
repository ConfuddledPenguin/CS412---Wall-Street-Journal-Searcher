   HOUSTON -- First City Bancorp. of Texas, concerned about
its ability to compete in the rapidly consolidating banking
business, said it is considering seeking one or more
money-center banks as minority partners.
   Such a move would go against the grain of current banking
trends. While much of the current talk of consolidation in
U.S. banking circles revolves around possible mergers between
cross-town rivals to reduce overhead, A. Robert Abboud, First
City's chairman and chief executive officer, envisions a
"special relationship" with one or more major international
banks, possibly including foreign institutions.

   In an interview, Mr. Abboud said he wants First City, a
relative lightweight with assets of less than $14 billion, to
be able to take advantage of opportunities presented by
Europe's economic integration and the decline of world
Communism.
   "What we're looking for is to be tied into a network that
would be world-wide," he said. He added that "a number of
international institutions" have expressed interest in First
City's plans.
   "The good news is we've got competition and we've got
interest," he said.
   Both Bank of New York Co. and BankAmerica Corp. have sent
teams to Texas to examine First City's loan portfolio in
recent weeks, according to people close to the situation.
Neither bank would comment.
   The move comes at a time when First City is struggling to
keep pace with some of its Texas competitors. Both NCNB Corp.
of Charlotte, N.C., and Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio,
have bought large Texas banking franchises with liberal doses
of federal assistance and have set about blanketing the state
with branches and billboards.
   First City, by contrast, has faltered a bit since it was
recapitalized in 1988 by an investor group led by Mr. Abboud.
Its federal assistance package wasn't as generous as some
competitors' packages, and it has been plagued recently by
reports of problems in its loan portfolio. First City says
such reports are overblown.
   The immediate reason for First City's urge to forge an
alliance stems from its need to refinance an expensive, $125
million issue of preferred stock, according to Mr. Abboud.
   When the preferred shares were first issued, First City's
investment bankers assumed holders would eventually convert
them into common stock. (The shares are convertible after
April 15 at a conversion rate of $27.22 a common share.) But
the company's stock price, after nearing $40 a share last
year, has tanked in recent months. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, First City shares
closed at $19.125, down 25 cents.
   If the stock doesn't recover sufficiently by April, First
City will either have to pay some $150 million to redeem the
preferred stock or begin paying an onerous dividend equal to
the prime rate of interest, the rate banks charge their best
customers, plus six percentage points. First City has
consistently said in the past that it plans to opt for
redemption.
   Mr. Abboud said First City, through its investment banker,
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., has begun
exploratory talks with several major banks about raising the
money needed to redeem the preferred stock. He added that
market conditions appear to be such that any new investor
would likely demand a common equity position in First City in
addition to any debt issue it might buy. He said the equity
might take the form of warrants or some other issue
convertible into common stock.
   The convertible preferred stock translates into 4.5
million shares of common stock. First City currently has 18.2
million shares outstanding.
   Mr. Abboud said he believes First City would make an
attractive partner because of its strong Texas franchise and
because he and other top officials have a great deal of
experience in international banking and in the oil business.
Mr. Abboud formerly served as chairman and chief executive of
First Chicago Corp. and president and chief operating officer
of Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles.
   He added that he has some leverage over how the
transaction proceeds. "The fact is I like this franchise. I
like being here and I have a big slug of stock. We're in the
unique position of controlling our destiny."
   People familiar with First City's plans say neither
BankAmerica nor Bank of New York is likely to be big enough
on its own to complete the sort of deal Mr. Abboud seeks.
   BankAmerica of San Francisco, with about $104 billion in
assets, is the second largest U.S. bank holding company,
after New York-based Citicorp. But on the world stage it
ranks around 50th, according to statistics compiled by the
American Banker, a trade publication, far behind the mammoth
Japanese and European banks that have come to dominate global
banking.
   New York-based Bank of New York's $49 billion in assets
rank it 13th in the U.S. and around 98th world-wide. And its
ability to make an investment in First City is suspect. Just
last month the Federal Reserve Board blocked a proposed
merger with Northeast Bancorp of New Haven, Conn., ruling
that such a move would harm Bank of New York's "ability to
maintain a strong capital position."
   Some banking sources suggested such constraints could lead
First City beyond U.S. borders in search of well-capitalized
partners. "It's hard to do" given the depressed share prices
and thin capital bases of most U.S. banks, said one
investment banker.
