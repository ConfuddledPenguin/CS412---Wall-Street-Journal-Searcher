   WASHINGTON -- The proposed Iroquois natural-gas pipeline
won a favorable ruling from a Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission official, boosting the chances for the
commission's approval of the project.
   An FERC administrative law judge said that the gas to be
delivered by the project is needed and that the project's
proposed rate structure is reasonable. The 369-mile, $582.6
million Iroquois Gas Transmission System pipeline is designed
to bring Canadian gas to the northeastern U.S.

   The commission had been expected to approve the project in
July. Instead, faced with significant opposition from
domestic producers, it set up a hearing process to allow for
further examination of the need and rate issue. Now, each
side gets time to submit further briefs in the case, with a
final decision by the commission expected by Nov. 28.
   The Independent Petroleum Association of America said that
it was disappointed by the law judge's findings and that it
intends to file objections with the commission. "We are
hopeful that the commission will maintain an open mind on
these matters," Paul Hilliard, the association's chairman,
said in a statement. "We are not done yet."
