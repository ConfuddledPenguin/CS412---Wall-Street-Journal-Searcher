   TOKYO -- Texas Instruments Inc. is asking Japanese
semiconductor manufacturers to pay higher royalties on its
basic patent for the production of dynamic random access
memory chips, Toshiba Corp. said.
   Texas Instruments' share price skyrocketed in response to
a Japanese press report that the U.S. firm is demanding as
royalties 10% of wholesale value of products using the chip.

   A spokesman for the Japanese electronics company declined
to confirm the report. But he said that there have been
negotiations with Texas Instruments and that the U.S. concern
has been demanding "considerably higher royalty payments." He
said the fee varies from company to company but usually
ranges from 1% to 3% of the production value.
   Other major Japanese companies, such as Fujitsu Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Electric Corp., also confirmed that they have been
negotiating with Texas Instruments on the renewal of
cross-licensing agreements. But their spokesmen said the
companies haven't received requests for higher royalties yet.
   The Toshiba official wouldn't speculate on the outlook for
the talks. But he indicated that it won't be easy for Texas
Instruments to win huge royalties because Japanese concerns
could respond in kind. "We have some important patents that
have been licensed to (Texas Instruments) so we are going to
use them as a leverage in negotiations," he said.
   According to the press reports, Texas Instruments is also
demanding royalty payments totaling an estimated 100 billion
yen ($750 million) a year under a separate Japanese patent.
Known as the Kilby patent, it covers all integrated computer
circuit. So far, no Japanese chip maker is paying royalties
on the Kilby patent because it was granted only recently.
   If the chip manufacturers agree to pay the DRAM royalties
demanded by Texas Instruments, as well as the royalties under
the Kilby patent, these payments would cost Japanese industry
a total of 200 billion yen a year, according to the Japanese
business newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
   Texas Instruments officials in Tokyo refused to comment on
the details, and Japanese company officials said they
couldn't immediately confirm the report.
