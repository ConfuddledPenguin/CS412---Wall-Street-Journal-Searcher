   FAIRFAX, Va. -- American Capital &amp; Research Corp. agreed
to buy Elder Resources NZFP Ltd.'s 50% interest in two
engineering joint ventures, giving American Capital full
ownership of the units.
   Terms weren't disclosed.

   The sale is part of Carter Holt Harvey Ltd.'s plan to
divest all of Elder Resources' non-forest assets. Last month,
Carter Holt, a New Zealand concern, acquired 52.7% of Elder
Resources from Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian company.
   American Capital said the acquisition of the units, Kaiser
Engineers Australia Pty. Ltd. and Kaiser Engineers
International, will reunite all of the Kaiser Engineers
companies under a single owner. American Capital already owns
the Kaiser operations in the U.S.
