   DENVER -- Dekalb Energy Co. said it agreed in principle to
swap oil properties in Alberta with Shell Canada Ltd. to
further its strategy of concentrating on fewer but larger
stakes in oil wells.
   Under the terms of the deal, Dekalb Energy Canada Ltd.
will trade its less than 1% interest in the proposed Caroline
Swan Hills gas unit for Shell's 4.8% interest in Sundre Unit
1 and its 15.22% interest in the Sundre Rundle "B" Pool.
