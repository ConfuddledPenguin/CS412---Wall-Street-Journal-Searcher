   William I. Campbell was named president and chief
executive officer of Philip Morris USA, Philip Morris Cos.'
domestic tobacco unit. The surprise move appeared to signal
unhappiness with the performance and management style of Ehud
Houminer, the current chief of the tobacco unit.
   Mr. Campbell, 46 years old, is currently senior vice
president of corporate planning.

   Mr. Houminer becomes senior vice president of Philip
Morris Management Corp. In that capacity, he will work on
"special projects of a strategic nature," according to a
statement issued by the New York-based company.
   A spokesman wouldn't elaborate and the executives in
question couldn't be reached for comment. But the unexpected
naming of Mr. Houminer to his new post is a setback for the
48-year-old executive, who made his name at Philip Morris by
masterminding the acquisitions of Kraft Inc. and General
Foods Corp. and the divestiture of 7-Up.
   "There is a major fear that for the first time in recent
memory Philip Morris USA will fall short of its unit volume
projections, and the feeling is that Bill Campbell is a bit
more in tune with the ever-changing dynamics of the
business," said Scott Feit, director of marketing at
Core-Mark Distributors Inc., the nation's largest
distributor. Until now, in an era when U.S. tobacco
consumption is dropping 2% to 3% annually, Philip Morris has
been registering modest unit gains.
   According to industry insiders, top management was also
unhappy with Mr. Houminer's decision to rush the company into
discount brands, like Basic and Bristol, which in essence
helped fuel the growth of the bargain, or so-called sub
generic, category.
   Tobacco distributors said that over the years the tobacco
giant had developed some very powerful relationships with the
trade and was known for its responsiveness to customers. But
soon after his arrival in 1988, Mr. Houminer, who had no
background in the tobacco business, began to engender ill
will among distributors by his rigid approach to
decision-making in the areas of credit and pricing. One move
that especially angered distributors was his decision to
allocate tobacco shipments long in advance of the industry's
twice-a-year price increases.
   In addition, Mr. Houminer managed to alienate company
employees. In one small but particularly unpopular gesture,
he eliminated the Secretary's Day perk of sending each
secretary in the tobacco unit a dozen roses.
   Analysts said the naming of Mr. Campbell would appear to
signal no major shift in strategy at the tobacco unit, Philip
Morris's largest operating division. "This isn't a hugely
significant development in terms of the strategic direction
of the tobacco business, or the whole company for that
matter," said Marc Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
   Earlier this summer, Mr. Campbell was credited with
playing a key role in the $3.8 billion acquisition of Jacob
Suchard, the Swiss candy and coffee maker. His previous
accomplishments included helping to launch Philip Morris's
tobacco export business in the highly lucrative Asian market.
While Mr. Campbell was executive vice president of marketing
at the tobacco unit from 1983 to 1988, Philip Morris's
domestic tobacco brands registered strong gains in market
share.
