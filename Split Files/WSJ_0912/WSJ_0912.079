   BRAZIL VS. ILLITERACY

   Brazil launched a national crusade against illiteracy.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office in
March pledging to modernize Brazil, announced the program
that aims to teach most of the 32 million illiterates to read
by 1995. The cost of the project through the end of 1991 will
be about $720 million.
   "By the end of my mandate, the number of illiterates will
be reduced by 70%," said President Collor, adding that Brazil
would always be backward if it didn't change its
"dramatically cruel and unjust" social system.
   Brazil, which had an estimated population last year of 154
million, has the worst distribution of income of any major
country in the world, and economists link this to the
extremely low standards of education for all except the rich.
                                                                                                       

   A PARKING BAN IN PARIS
                                                                                                       

   A ban on parking along 17 miles of major Paris streets
went into effect yesterday, part of a campaign to ease severe
traffic congestion. The restrictions prohibit parking at any
time along a series of designated roads that form major
east-west and north-south routes. A special force of 120
police and traffic officers will enforce the new rules;
violators face having their cars towed and fines of $85.
Affected routes include some of Paris's best-known streets,
such as the Rue de Rivoli and the Boulevard Saint Michel.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE MAP AMAZON REGION
                                                                                                       

   China has won its first overseas aerial-survey contract, a
$7 million deal to map part of Brazil's Amazon River basin,
the China News Service reported. More than 100 Chinese
technicians arrived in Brazil last month to survey a 25,000
square mile region using remote sensing equipment, according
to the news agency. The project, funded by a World Bank loan,
will produce maps to improve land management in Brazil's
northeast.
                                                                                                       

   NEW TOURIST DESTINATION
                                                                                                       

   In anticipation of the 1993 opening of the tunnel under
the English Channel, England's county of Kent and the French
department of Nord-Pas de Calais are promoting themselves as
a new tourist destination, Region Transmanche. Two bilingual
publications are available -- a diary of festivals and fairs
and a guide to more than 60 tourist attractions in the two
regions. The books were financed by the European Year of
Tourism, an initiative of the European Community and the
European Free Trade Association.
                                                                                                       

   TRANSIT SYSTEM FOR BANGKOK
                                                                                                       

   Thailand's Council of Economic Ministers endorsed Lavalin
International Group's bid to build and operate the Skytrain
transit system in Bangkok, pushing the long-delayed, $1.66
billion project past its latest hurdle. With the decision,
Lavalin International, which includes Japanese and Thai
partners led by Canada's Lavalin Inc., triumphed over
Asia-Euro Consortium, made up of European and Thai partners
headed by Leighton Contractors (Asia) Ltd., the Hong Kong
unit of Australia's Leighton Holdings Ltd. Skytrain, an
above-ground, rapid-transit system has been on and off Thai
planners' drawing boards for a quarter century.
                                                                                                       

   NORWAY FIGHTS SOVIET POLLUTION
                                                                                                       

   Norway has earmarked $50 million in aid to help clean up
Soviet industries that are polluting the arctic regions of
both countries. "We are not doing this to solve a Soviet
problem, but to solve a Norwegian problem," said Prime
Minister Jan P. Syse. Pollution from outdated Soviet smelters
drifts into northern Norway, damaging the fragile arctic
environment.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMANY'S NUCLEAR PLANTS
                                                                                                       

   East Germany's two Soviet-made nuclear-power plants are
likely to be closed for good after German unification because
it would cost too much to make them safe, West German
Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said.
   Bringing safety equipment up to standard at the plants
made little economic sense because of time-consuming approval
procedures and expense, Mr. Toepfer told a news conference.
The Bonn Environment Ministry assumes authority over East
German nuclear-power reactors with unification Oct. 3.
   "Considering that the existing operating license expires
under the German unity treaty on June 30, 1995, the operating
time remaining would be shortened so much that modernization
would make little economic sense," Mr. Toepfer said in
reference to the larger Greifswald power plant. Time was
running even shorter at the Rheinberg plant, where the
license expires at the end of 1992.
   Under East Germany's former communist government, five
nuclear-power reactors operated at the two sites. The
Rheinberg reactor and three of four units at Greifswald have
already been turned off, with the fourth to follow soon.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   "It looks like a museum," said sailor Yevgeni Gerko of the
new Pizza Hut on Moscow's Kutuzovsky Prospekt. He was one of
about 300 Soviets who waited in line for up to four hours for
the restaurant's official opening yesterday. . . . There will
be a record 3,298 centenarians in Japan by the end of this
month, and four out of five of them will be women, a Health
and Welfare Ministry report said. Japan's oldest person is
Waka Shirahama, a 112-year-old woman from the Miyazaki
region.
