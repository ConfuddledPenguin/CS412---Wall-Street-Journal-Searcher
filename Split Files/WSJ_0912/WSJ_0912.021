   International Business Machines Corp. will soon introduce
several new file servers, specialized personal computers that
act as the hubs of computer networks, industry executives and
consultants said. The announcement, planned for next month,
will finally put IBM in direct competition with Compaq
Computer Corp. at the top end of the fast-growing file-server
market, to which Compaq laid claim last year with its highly
publicized Systempro computer. The IBM machines also will be
a credible alternative to servers sold by NetFrame Systems
Inc. and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the executives
said.
   But IBM's new models will apparently fall short of the
impressive "superserver" technology the company has been
demonstrating at trade shows. Instead, the executives said,
IBM will position the new Personal System/2 Model 95 as the
first in a line of high-powered servers that will culminate
next year in the "superserver."

   IBM already sells two models that act as file servers: the
entry-level Model 65 SX, based on Intel Corp.'s 80386SX
microprocessor; and the mid-level Model 80, based on Intel's
80386 chip. But the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant still hasn't
designed a machine around Intel's latest and most powerful
chip, the i486, and has shied away from a technology race at
the high end of the PC market, where file servers have
attracted the most attention.
   "IBM has been lax so far in addressing this market," said
John Dunkle of WorkGroup Technologies Inc., a Hampton, N.H.,
market research firm. "At this point, they need to make a
very successful introduction if they're going to convince
people that they're serious about playing."
   File servers, which store files and act as traffic cops
for computers on a network, have gained in importance as
networks become more powerful and take work away from larger
and more expensive systems. Compaq in particular has touted
networks using its i486-based Systempro as a possible
replacement for minicomputers and even mainframe computers.
   Still, the Systempro and other high-powered servers are
much more complicated to sell and set up than regular
personal computers, and have sold slowly since they emerged
last year. As a result, IBM isn't too far behind the curve.
"If they can come up with a competitive product, IBM will
still be considered by everyone," said Matt Fitzsimmons, a
ComputerLand Corp. dealer in Westchester County, N.Y.
   According to the industry executives and consultants,
IBM's new Model 95, several versions of which are still being
fieldtested, will be based on the i486 and will include
special technology to speed the movement of data in and out
of its hard disk drives.
   It also will offer high-capacity drives providing a total
of as many as 2.3 gigabytes of memory -- about 1.4 million
typewritten pages -- and can use IBM's new four-megabit
memory chip for its internal memory, they said.
   The new machine will be introduced along with a
number-crunching desktop companion, the Model 90, which also
will be based on the i486, the executives said.
   And both models will offer a new standard for displaying
graphics on computer screens. Dubbed XGA, for Extended
Graphics Array, it will be compatible with more previous
standards but will provide more color and detail -- enough to
handle video input comfortably, the executives said.
   An IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's
plans for a file server, but IBM executives have previously
indicated that they intend to provide a i486-based server
before the end of 1990.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, IBM
rose $1.625 to 107.50.
   Separately, IBM said it reduced prices and increased the
standard memory on its entry-level PS/2 Model 25 286 personal
computer.
