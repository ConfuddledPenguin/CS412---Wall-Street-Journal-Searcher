   Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
are again at odds over how best to market OS/2, the
underlying software both companies say is central to the
personal computer's future.
   The differences are wide, but most observers think they
are unlikely to force a complete breach between the two
companies, which together defined the basic features of the
PC during the 1980s.

   IBM and Microsoft have been fighting for years over how
best to develop and promote OS/2, which controls the basic
functions of a PC. Introduced by the two companies in 1987,
OS/2 initially was described as an eventual replacement for
DOS, the operating software made by Microsoft for IBM's
original PC. More than three years later, OS/2 is considered
a flop, requiring expensive hardware and failing to meet
technical promises made for it.
   Meanwhile, customers remain as loyal to DOS as ever.
That's partly because Microsoft greatly contributed to DOS's
longevity by releasing a program in May called Windows 3.0
that allows DOS to match some of OS/2's most compelling
features. Analysts expect Microsoft to sell about two million
copies of Windows this year, while sales of OS/2 are
estimated to be a fraction of that.
   Last November, Microsoft and IBM called a truce to the
wrangling over OS/2, but it hasn't held. "The accord is still
officially in place, but it's clear that IBM and Microsoft
aren't exactly of one mind with regards to OS/2," said Will
Zachmann, a computer analyst in Duxbury, Mass. "Microsoft is
pushing Windows, and IBM is saying, `No, no, OS/2 is just
fine.'"
   Under the November deal, the two companies agreed to
release a revamped version of OS/2 that requires less than
half of the internal computer memory of the full-blown OS/2.
According to a spokeswoman, IBM is widely showing this "lite"
version of OS/2 to customers and is considering introducing
it shortly.
   "It's our intention to bring it out as a product, but we
haven't said when," said the IBM spokeswoman.
   For its part, Microsoft is having second thoughts about
the product and has been leading a quiet campaign to
disparage it. In a series of meetings recently, Steve
Ballmer, who oversees Microsoft's operating systems business,
has said that the memory requirements for OS/2 can only be
slightly reduced without abandoning some of the program's
most impressive features. He said it makes more sense for
Microsoft to continue working to fulfill the intitial
technical promises for OS/2, which would give OS/2 clear
advantages over Windows in such areas as speed, multitasking
and networking. Observers think Microsoft can deliver this
so-called 32-bit version of OS/2 by early next year.
   Industry observers say it's likely OS/2 "lite" and the
32-bit OS/2 will coexist. They say IBM is attracted to OS/2
"lite" because it would satisfy many of its biggest
customers, large corporations that have designed OS/2 into
companywide computing systems and now need an improved
version. But they fear that in reality IBM seeks to slow
sales of Windows, because if it becomes too popular, it
threatens to kill off OS/2 altogether.
   "OS/2 `lite' is much better than any existing version of
OS/2," said George Grayson, president of Micrografx Inc., a
software company in Richardson, Texas. "The problem is that
IBM insists on doing it as an alternative to Windows,"
setting up a situation where IBM is trying to reduce Windows'
appeal.
   The renewed dispute over OS/2 comes at a time when IBM is
broadening its reliance on Microsoft's rivals. Recently, Big
Blue has struck several new alliances with software makers,
such as Go Corp. and Next Inc., and some say these new
relationships could grow in importance and even jeopardize
Microsoft's status as IBM's most important software supplier.
   Indeed, IBM announced what appears to be its most
significant new software partnership only last week, when it
said it plans to develop a set of software guidelines with
Metaphor Computer Systems Inc., a closely held company in
Mountain View, Calif. The partnership aims to relieve some of
the confusion among developers of PC applications such as
spreadsheets and word processors over which operating system
-- OS/2 or ones sold by rivals -- they should work on.
   By adopting the partnership's guidelines, developers
"wouldn't have to worry much about making an operating-system
bet," said David Liddle, Metaphor's chairman. "Once they've
done an application {to the guidelines}, it works with lots
of operating systems."
   Mr. Liddle stressed that the partnership's work, which may
take several years to come to market, is "not a replacement
for OS/2." But analysts said it marks a shift in the
relationship between IBM, Armonk, N.Y., and Microsoft,
Redmond, Wash.
   "That's the statement from IBM, which they can't make
publicly, that they are declaring independence from
Microsoft," said Stewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter. Mr.
Alsop said that should the partnership succeed, IBM "will
have driven a wedge" between it and Microsoft, "regaining
control over applications" for PCs.
   But no one expects IBM's reliance on Microsoft to lessen
overnight. "The relationship between IBM and Microsoft has
been very beneficial to our customers, and it's too important
to both companies to have it not continue to be a good
relationship," said Jim Cannavino, the general manager of
IBM's PC business.
   Indeed, the long-term ambitions of Microsoft and IBM
dovetail nicely. Big Blue needs a robust OS/2 in order to
fulfill its desire to tie PCs together with its disparate
families of mainframe and minicomputers. In coming years,
customers are expected to demand operating software that
allows them to perform many tasks at once. Some of these
tasks are likely to be performed automatically. OS/2, and not
the combination of DOS and Windows, is designed for precisely
such work.
   Microsoft, meanwhile, needs OS/2 in order to retain its
control of software standards for PCs. In an interview
earlier this year, Mr. Ballmer said a successful OS/2 should
block the spread to PCs of Unix, another operating system now
used mainly by minicomputers and workstations.
