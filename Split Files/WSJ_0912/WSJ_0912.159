   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange sought federal
bankruptcy-court permission to bring disciplinary proceedings
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. that could result
in a record Big Board fine of as much as $50 million.
   Lawyers for the Big Board said the exchange wants to
punish Drexel for the securities-law violations and fraud it
pleaded guilty to last September. But the exchange has been
stymied by Drexel's bankruptcy proceedings. Under bankruptcy
law, the exchange can't take any action against the company
without the court's approval.

   At a hearing in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan,
Michael Levin, an attorney for the exchange, also said that
the Big Board is continuing its investigation of individual
Drexel officials. The exchange doesn't need court permission
to pursue its case against the individuals, who are said to
include former Drexel Chief Executive Officer Frederick
Joseph.
   Mr. Levin said the exchange wants to impose a large fine
on Drexel to send a message to other firms. He said Drexel's
actions had an "extensive, seriously disruptive impact on the
financial markets of the U.S."
   The fine -- if approved after an exchange hearing -- would
become an unsecured claim against Drexel. Drexel filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13.
   Both Drexel and its creditors committee opposed the Big
Board's request, claiming that it will unfairly penalize
creditors and stockholders. In a filing with U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Howard Buschman III, Drexel said it had already been
adequately punished financially: the firm agreed to pay fines
and penalties totaling $650 million to the Securities and
Exchange Commission for the same wrongdoing at issue in the
Big Board's case.
   "What is at issue here is an effort to obtain a windfall
from {Drexel}," said Lawrence P. Gottesman, an attorney for
the creditors' committee. He said the proceeding would waste
the debtor's resources by requiring it to litigate the same
issues that were settled by Drexel's guilty plea and SEC
agreement last year.
   Richard Krasnow, an attorney for Drexel, said, "Censure
isn't the focus. . . . What they are seeking is simply to
extract a fine, to add their numbers to the $650 million that
is already being sought" by the SEC.
   Roy Regozin, another attorney for Drexel, said the company
will strongly contest the exchange's charges because of the
huge fine that is being sought. The proposed fine -- $25
million each for the parent company and the brokerage unit --
would be the largest that the Big Board has ever imposed on a
securities firm. In the previous record, E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
was fined $400,000 in 1985 after pleading guilty to felonies
in a check-kiting scheme.
   According to bankruptcy court filings, the Big Board first
brought administrative charges against Drexel last November.
The exchange charged that by pleading guilty last year,
Drexel also was admitting that it had "engaged in acts
detrimental to the interest or welfare of the exchange."
   The exchange, in its filing with Judge Buschman, said
Drexel had made a settlement offer to the Big Board, but that
the amount was too low. The exchange said it responded on
March 7 by telling Drexel it would accept nothing less than
$25 million and a censure of the firm to settle the charges.
   When Drexel didn't respond to the exchange's deadlines for
settlement talks, a hearing was set for May 31, despite
Drexel's objections. Two days before the hearing, Drexel's
brokerage unit filed for bankruptcy-law protection --
triggering the automatic bankruptcy-law stay that halted the
proceedings. Although the parent company had filed for
bankruptcy protection in February, the exchange could still
proceed as long as the brokerage unit hadn't filed.
   Judge Buschman said he would rule on the Big Board's
request within a month. During the hearing, Judge Buschman
said he was inclined to allow the exchange to continue with
efforts to censure or suspend Drexel, but that he might delay
efforts to seek a fine.
   Meanwhile, according to individuals familiar with the
ongoing investigation, Big Board attorneys have subpoenaed
former Drexel employees to testify to determine whether Mr.
Joseph and others failed to properly supervise Michael
Milken, the former Drexel junk-bond chief who pleaded guilty
to charges relating to illegal trading. The Big Board has
indicated that it may seek fines against Mr. Joseph and
others. Mr. Joseph hasn't been charged with any crime.
   A Drexel spokesman issued the following statement
yesterday: "We believe the stock exchange, once it completes
its study, will recognize that the transgressions involved
verbal agreements that were not disclosed to the firm and
which could not have been otherwise detected by any firm."
