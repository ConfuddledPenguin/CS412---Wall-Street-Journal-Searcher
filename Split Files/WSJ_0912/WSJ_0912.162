   PHILADELPHIA -- Sam Karlin says his grandmother killed her
husband and her children, and then took her own life. She did
it with a knife -- a butter knife.
   Today, determined to avoid the same death by cholesterol,
Mr. Karlin and his family have made their home a fort in the
war on fat. In the basement they keep a stockroom of canned,
defatted chicken broth and packaged rice cakes. From another
room, filled with anti-fat propaganda, they run a support
group for 200 other dieters of the fat-free persuasion. Mr.
Karlin, a science teacher who sells insurance on the side,
has written a poem for the group that reads, in part:

   Our sex life got better (if you know what I mean),
   `Cause it's better in bed when your arteries are clean]
                                                                                                       

   For the Karlins and others, the fat-free diet is more than
an ideal: It is a sacred mission.
   It is also, many doctors say, a mission impossible: People
can't reduce the percentage of calories provided by fat in
their diet much below 10% for a prolonged period, and if they
could, it could cause serious health problems or even death.
   Still, the dedicated keep trying. While many
health-conscious Americans have reduced their consumption of
fatty foods, the fat-free purists strive to avoid fat
entirely. "People say you should do everything in
moderation," says Sam Karlin's wife, Judy. "But moderation
doesn't work."
   True believers in fat-free diets even reject some
vegetables. "I'm good 98% of the time," says fat fighter
Janet Abrams of Palm Desert, Calif. But in the other 2%, she
says, "I cheat." Her transgression: an occasional olive or
avocado. Treason, say others. "Fat is the enemy," asserts Jay
Reifer, another fat-free convert in suburban Philadelphia.
"This isn't a diet; it's a way of life."
   It's not an easy life. Sam Karlin's brother, Harvey, says
Sam nearly came to blows with a waiter after finding traces
of Bernaise sauce on his chicken at a family dinner in a
restaurant. Friends think the Karlins are nuts. Triglycerides
and bowel movements make less than engaging table talk over
hors d'oeuvres (not that the Karlins would touch canapes,
anyway.) The Karlins, who ran with a social dinner crowd, say
they don't get as many invitations any more. "We lost
friends," Mrs. Karlin says.
   "Things are not the same as they were," observes Diane
Boss, who was the maid of honor at Mrs. Karlin's wedding. The
Karlins' diet, she says, "definitely affects the
relationship." Another friend, Sandee Silverstein, who has
seen the Karlins through their lean times, adds: "When
somebody says I'm not going to eat anything at your affair,
for some people, that's very aggravating."
   The Karlins hauled their own low-fat turkeyburgers to a
friend's barbecue. On another occasion they brought a carob
mousse to a host's house. He took one bite and set it on the
floor for his dog.
   Finding fat-free food away from home is a problem for many
other dieters, too. Chris Copetas, an assistant district
attorney in Pittsburgh, moved a refrigerator and a microwave
oven into his courthouse office to prepare his own fat-free
lunches. William van Arsdale, treasurer of Gettysburg College
in Pennsylvania, telephones ahead to restaurants to order
steamed vegetables, salad without dressing and baked potatoes
without sour cream or butter, and whole-grain bread.
   Mr. van Arsdale is another dieter who occasionally slips.
He says he often exceeds his daily limit of six pieces of
fruit and eats as many as eight or nine. Mr. Karlin owns up
to lustfully looking into a South Street cheese-steak shop.
But, he says, he didn't succumb. Mentally visualizing "what
such food would do to my coronary artery," he says, helps him
put the devil behind him and stick to such healthy fare as a
plate of garbanzo beans washed down with diluted fruit juice.
Afterward, he says, "I get up from the table and feel good. I
see the clear artery."
   Once connoisseurs of Big Macs and peanut butter, the
Karlins now carry oil-free dressing and non-fat dry milk
wherever they go. (Mortified by the brown paper bag they
carried everywhere with their special milk, dressing and
other items, brother Harvey bought them a camera bag so they
could be more discreet.) They spend their weekends devising
new uses for dry-curd cottage cheese.
   Sunday brunch in their home in northern Philadelphia
includes whole-wheat crepes filled with their cottage cheese,
egg white omelettes, and a coffee substitute made from
barley.
   "Some of this stuff is awful," concedes Mr. Karlin, 44. He
says a fat-free pumpkin bread turned out so mushy that the
family drank it. The Karlins' cheesecake, made of their
no-fat cottage cheese, looks great garnished with strawberry
and kiwi. But it tastes like this newspaper.
   Even Mrs. Karlin, 41, has an occasional doubt. "Am I
brainwashed?" she wonders, covering her toast with imitation
cream cheese she made by straining non-fat yogurt.
   "They're absolutely crazy," cookbook author Julia Child
says of fat-free dieters in general. "Why torture yourself?"
She says studies show that chimpanzees with super-lean diets
are more vicious and angry than their fat-feasting peers.
Some research also suggests that lowering cholesterol in
humans is associated with increased assertiveness and
violence. "If you don't have fun you're not going to last
long," Ms. Child says. "Life isn't worth living that way."
   The wiry though not underfed Karlins disagree. They are
proud of their frenetic energy. Mrs. Karlin credits her rosy
complexion to the diet, and son Joseph, 18, claims it spared
him teen-age acne.
   The Karlins have resorted to subterfuge to avoid fat.
Visiting Disney World, they lied that they had health
problems so they could get a refrigerator in their room for
their non-fat delicacies. When an unenlightened client handed
Mr. Karlin a Coke recently, he excused himself to the
bathroom, flushed it down, and returned.
   Nutritionists aren't sure that low-fat diets will yield
longer lives than more moderate eating. The American Heart
Association recommends a diet with a caloric intake provided
30% by fat. (One gram of fat has nine calories; a gram of
protein or carbohydrate has four.)
   Extremely low-fat diets are "a pretty risky concept," says
Dr. Burton Kallman of the American Dietetic Association. Some
fatty acids are essential to health. And too little fat can
impair the body's ability to utilize some vitamins. "Fat does
a lot of positive things," says Jeanne Goldberg, professor at
the Tufts University nutrition school. "It adds to a feeling
of fullness and it carries flavor."
   Many doctors say the health benefits of ultra-low-fat
diets remain uncertain. One study last month reported that
reducing caloric fat intake could shrink arterial deposits,
but doctors generally agree that the evidence is
inconclusive. "You can't prove that if you eat a 20% fat diet
you'll live longer than if you ate 30%," says Dr. Neil Stone
of Northwestern University's medical school, a member of the
heart association's nutrition committee. In any case, he
says, few people can stick with extremely low-fat diets.
   Even among militants the attrition rate is high. Dr.
Stephen Inkeles of the Pritikin Longevity Center, in Santa
Monica, Calif., says only a quarter of those without previous
medical problems who take part in the center's diet stay on
the diet fully. Half abandon it entirely.
   Despite all their problems, the Karlins say they're happy
with their diet. They accept that they need some fat to live
and don't believe that they are getting too little because,
Mr. Karlin says, they look good and feel good. Says Mr.
Karlin, quoting from his ode:
                                                                                                       

   So when friends criticize and say, "Your eating's
bizarre,"
   Don't be upset, you'll outlive them by far.
