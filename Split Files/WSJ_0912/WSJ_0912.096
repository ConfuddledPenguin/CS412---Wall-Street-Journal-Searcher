   Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank, or Amro, confirmed it is in a
Western European banking consortium that is working on
setting up a commercial bank in Warsaw.
   Amro, which recently merged with Algemene Bank Nederland,
declined to identify its partners in the venture or provide
detailed information. "There is a project that is under way,
but at this stage there is nothing we can say about it," an
Amro spokesman said. "We are only in the preliminary stage of
applying for licenses and so on."

   The spokesman confirmed that Amro and other banks are
working in tandem with International Finance Corp., a World
Bank affiliate, to set up a bank that will conduct syndicated
activities. The IFC provides funding for development
projects.
   People in the Italian banking industry said Banca
Commerciale Italiana, which has a representative office in
Warsaw, and Credit Lyonnais are the other two Western banks
in the consortium. They and other Western banks participate
in the International Moscow Bank, founded last year.
