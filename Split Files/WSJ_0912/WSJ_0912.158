   TAX SUMMIT could produce bill larded with breaks for
narrow interests.
   Both Democrats and Republicans are pushing for expanded
tax benefits for individual retirement accounts. Democrats
would give the incentives when money is put into the account;
Republicans would hold the breaks until money is withdrawn.
Citing the Persian Gulf crisis, both parties also are angling
to reinstate tax incentives for oil drilling like the ones
that were pared back in tax revision just four years ago.

   Each side inches toward extending permanently a slew of
soon-to-expire tax breaks, though they each choose their own
favorites. Republicans press President Bush's research and
development credits and the 25% deduction for purchase of
health insurance by self-employed people. They leave out the
low-income housing credit, which they know is a priority of
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
   The Democrats' proposal includes a $1.2 billion fund to
pay for the members' special give-aways.
                                                                                                       

   SAGGING TAX REVENUES skew budget plans in most states.
   With weak economies, waning consumer confidence and
shrinking Federal assistance, "it's going to be a rough year
for states," says Ron Snell of the National Conference of
State Legislators. More than 30 states already are predicting
revenues this fiscal year will fall below projections, with
New England and Mid-Atlantic states among the hardest hit.
Virginia dourly contemplates a $1.4 billion revenue crunch
over two years. Florida revenue officials expect to come up
$500 million short this year. Maryland sees a $150 million
gap.
   Texas and other oil-producing states, though, could see
increased petrodollars flowing from tensions in the Middle
East. Though Texas crude is selling for $31 a barrel now, up
from $19 a year ago, "we aren't making any predictions yet,"
says the state comptroller's office. But Texas figures each
dollar increase in crude prices could bring in $50 million of
additional taxes a year.
                                                                                                       

   MASSACHUSETTS STRUGGLES to write rules for new 5% tax on
services.
   "It's going to get tricky," allows Revenue Commissioner
Stephen Kidder. With less than three months left before the
Dec. 1 effective date for most categories, "we're still not
too far down the road on a lot of collection issues," he
says. And new problems crop up almost daily. Just last week,
the Boston Ballet and Boston Garden came asking whether
customers who already have purchased tickets for next season
must now pay the levy. Forget it, they were told.
   Lawyers, accountants, architects and engineers -- who have
been protesting the tax as unenforceable since it became law
in August -- wish they could forget about it, too. The
state's revenue officials "don't have a clue about what goes
on inside a law or accounting firm," contends Ned Hines, a
Boston lawyer who is challenging the constitutionality of the
new tax. Joe Donovan of CPAs Coopers &amp; Lybrand complains that
state officials aren't even sure whether tax preparation and
consulting services should be taxed.
   Massachusetts' ability to resolve such issues could be a
litmus test for other states hungry for new revenue sources.
                                                                                                       

   TREASURY'S LONG-AWAITED report on eliminating double
taxation of corporate dividends will have to be awaited still
more. The deadline, first April or May, then Nov. 30, now
"might slip" again "toward the end of the year," a Treasury
official says.
                                                                                                       

   STAY HOME] The IRS, in a final version of a rule proposed
19 months ago, says it no longer will grant an automatic
two-month extension to taxpayers traveling outside the U.S.
on April 15. Military personnel overseas, though, still get
the break.
                                                                                                       

   SOAK THE RICH, but spare the champagne. Democrats exempt
sparkling wine in their proposal to lift taxes on other
booze. The apparent reason: Champagne, as the industry has
tirelessly pointed out, is already taxed at a much higher
rate than other alcoholic beverages.
                                                                                                       

   A DIVORCE SETTLEMENT doesn't cut a required IRA
distribution, the IRS says.
   A chap we'll call Chagrined turned 70 1/2 in 1988, so in
1989 he was required to make a minimum taxable withdrawal
from his individual retirement account based on his life
expectancy and the IRA's value as of Dec. 31, 1988. But
Chagrined got divorced in 1989 and, under the settlement
terms, he transferred half the value of his IRA that year to
his ex-wife. Hoping to save some tax dollars, he asked the
IRS to figure the 1989 minimum distribution on what he owned
after the divorce, not in 1988 before the decree.
   IRS private ruling 9011031 sends regrets. Chagrined was
still married in 1988, and that's the date that will have to
be used in valuing the IRA assets, the service holds,
contending there is no authority for recognizing changes
after the date set by the regulations. But all's not lost,
notes publisher Research Institute of America.
   Starting this year, Chagrined will be able to reduce his
payout to reflect the IRA's post-divorce worth.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: John Monaco, a 28-year veteran of the IRS, is
named director of the service's Coordinated Examination
Program, which audits returns of the nation's 1,500 largest
corporations. . . . Taxpayers eager to avoid IRS user fees
should delay filing ruling requests until after Sept. 29,
when the authority for the fees runs out. But not too long
after, because the charges are likely to be reimposed, CPAs
Laventhol &amp; Horwath suggests.
