   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. said it agreed in principle to
pay the Department of Energy $83.8 million to settle claims
stemming from an investigation of alleged violations of the
government's crude-oil price controls.
   Salomon said the settlement won't lead to a charge against
earnings. The parent of Salomon Brothers Inc. disputed many
of the department's claims but said it agreed to settle to
avoid years of litigation.

   The settlement is the latest from a string of claims made
by the Energy Department. For several years, the department
has been investigating the transactions of thousands of
companies suspected of violating the government's crude-oil
price controls, which were in effect during the sharp rise in
oil prices in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo.
   The Reagan administration terminated the controls in 1981.
   In September 1988, the Energy Department started
administrative proceedings against Salomon, seeking payment
of as much as $108 million, plus interest. But Salomon said
the department's recent administrative proceedings "have
reduced significantly the company's maximum potential
exposure" under the government's allegations.
   The planned settlement would be one of the few jolts for
Salomon so far this year; both its securities business and
its Phibro Energy oil unit have been thriving, particularly
in the wake of the recent Iraqi attack against Kuwait and the
resulting wild swings in oil and stock prices.
   The settlement caps a four-year battle between Salomon and
the Energy Department. In 1987, a federal judge ordered
Salomon to turn over to the department virtually all its
documents relating to the company's purchases and sales of
crude oil from 1973 to 1980.
   The judge's order came despite complaints by Salomon about
the "voluminous" amount of data the department was seeking --
specified in 103 pages of subpoenas. The Energy Department
was looking into whether Salomon resold crude oil at an
appropriate price under the government's regulations when
they were in effect.
   In 1987, Salomon separately settled with the Energy
Department concerning crude-oil sales from 1973 to 1977 by
paying about $16.3 million, including interest.
