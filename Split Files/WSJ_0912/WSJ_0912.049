   Burritt Interfinancial Bancorp's stock plunged on its
announcement that it expects to report that third-quarter
non-performing loans, those not earning interest, will rise
and that earnings in the third and fourth quarters will drop.
   The New Britain, Conn., bank holding company estimates
that non-performing assets will rise to 5% to 6% of assets
for the third quarter from about 1.1% in the second quarter.
As a result, the company foresees a "significant decline" in
profit for the third and fourth quarters.

stock yesterday; when trading resumed, its stock sank to
