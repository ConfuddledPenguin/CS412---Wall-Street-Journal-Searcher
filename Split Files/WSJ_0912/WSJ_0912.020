   TOKYO -- Japanese machinery makers received orders
totaling 1.814 trillion yen ($13.01 billion) in July, up 24%
from a year earlier, the Economic Planning Agency said.
   Orders showed broad and substantial gains. Those from
overseas gained 40% from a year earlier to 494.2 billion yen,
following a 71% jump in the previous month. Compared with
June, however, orders were down a seasonally adjusted 5.1%.
