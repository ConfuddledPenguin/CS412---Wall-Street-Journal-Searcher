   Researchers have developed new evidence that people with
little or no health insurance may get lower-quality health
care.
   Scientists in Boston found that heart patients with
private health insurance are much more likely to receive
costly treatment, such as coronary bypass, than patients who
are uninsured or are covered by Medicaid.

   Separately, researchers in New York found a marked
increase in the portion of hospital costs for AIDS patients
paid by state-federal Medicaid programs rather than private
insurance. The trend threatens patients' access to "promising
new care," the researchers say, and increases financial
pressures on already burdened inner-city public health
systems.
   Together, the reports, published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, underscore growing concern
among policy makers and business leaders over the more than
31 million uninsured U.S. citizens and funding crises at many
state Medicaid programs. Indeed, both public and private
sectors are buckling under increasing health costs.
   "If we {want} a health care system in which insurance
status plays no part in whether a patient receives good care,
then we need to consider providing insurance for everyone,"
says Mark D. Wenneker, a physician and health-policy
researcher at the New England Medical Center, Boston.
   Other research has linked health-insurance coverage with
access to care. Dr. Wenneker, of the medical center's
Institute for the Improvement of Medical Care and Health, and
colleagues at Harvard Medical School say their study is the
first to show that the correlation extends to expensive heart
treatments. They studied records of 37,994 patients admitted
to Massachusetts hospitals with heart disease symptoms in
1985.
   Patients with private insurance were 80% more likely than
uninsured patients to have angiography, a diagnostic
procedure that enables doctors to see on X-ray films whether
coronary arteries are obstructed. Insured patients were 40%
more likely to undergo coronary bypass and 28% more likely to
have coronary angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped catheter
is threaded into the heart and inflated to open clogged
arteries. Rates were similar for Medicaid patients, though
the difference for angioplasty was even more pronounced.
   The researchers didn't find a reason for the differences.
Dr. Wenneker noted that hospitals and doctors have been under
financial pressures that could discourage them from offering
some services to low-paying or non-paying patients. In
addition, "patients who don't have insurance are much more
reticent about undergoing expensive treatments" for fear of
piling up huge bills, Dr. Wenneker added.
   The study also didn't establish whether privately insured
patients ultimately fared better than those in other groups.
Arnold M. Epstein and Joel S. Weissman, both at Harvard, were
co-authors of the study.
   In the AIDS report, Jesse Green, director of health policy
research at New York University School of Medicine, and Peter
Arno of the Einstein College of Medicine, New York, found
that Medicaid paid 54.6% of AIDS hospital costs in New York
City in 1988, up only slightly from the previous year, but up
from 39.7% in 1983. In San Francisco, Medicaid paid 30% of
the costs in 1987, up from 18.5% in 1983.
   The authors describe the trend as the "Medicaidization" of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Because Medicaid usually
reimburses doctors at much lower rates than private insurers,
the authors say primary-care doctors are reluctant to accept
Medicaid patients. Indeed, New York Medicaid pays $11 for an
office visit by a new patient, the researchers say, while a
private insurer pays $84.
   If new treatments that are prolonging the life of AIDS
patients are typically administered through primary-care
doctors, AIDS patients on Medicaid could be denied access to
them, the researchers say, and will increasingly seek
treatment at hospital emergency rooms.
