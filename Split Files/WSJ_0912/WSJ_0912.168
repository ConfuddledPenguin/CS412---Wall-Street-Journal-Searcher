   ATLANTA -- Courier Dispatch Group Inc. expects to report
that revenue for its fourth quarter and year ended June 30
rose about 9% and 8%, respectively, from year-earlier
periods, Paul R. Dean, president and chief executive officer,
said.
   Mr. Dean said in an interview that earnings for the fourth
quarter were flat because of large expenditures to improve
operations. He projected that earnings in the current quarter
"will be up sharply" from the $101,000, or four cents a
share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, 1989.

   Courier, which provides air and ground delivery services,
primarily in New England, the Southeast and upper Midwest,
expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of between $160,000
and $190,000, or between six cents and eight cents a share,
Mr. Dean said. A year ago, net income was $189,000, or seven
cents a share. Fourth-quarter revenue could be as much as $14
million, he said, compared with $12.3 million a year ago.
   A major acquisition in Alabama in April, expanded
operations in New England and Florida and efforts to replace
current vehicles with more fuel-efficient ones are
contributing to improved performance, he said.
   Mr. Dean said that for the year Courier's net fell to
between $400,000 and $600,000, or between 16 cents and 19
cents a share, from $723,000, or 28 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue was between $49 million and $51 million,
compared with $47.1 million a year earlier.
   Courier has added a temporary fuel surcharge -- about 2%
-- to its services because of the Mideast crisis, Mr. Dean
said. The increase hasn't cost the company any customers.
Courier expects to remove the surcharge, "as soon as we see
some relief in fuel prices," he said.
