   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former chief financial officer of
ZZZZBest Co., the scandal-wracked carpet-cleaning concern,
agreed to be banned from doing any public auditing work, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said.
   Bruce T. Anderson, a certified public accountant, agreed
to the premanent ban in a settlement of an administrative
action, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.

   He is barred from auditing the books of companies
registered with the SEC or seeking SEC registration to sell
securities to the public.
   In a civil suit by the SEC last month in California, Mr.
Anderson was accused of knowingly helping ZZZZBest file
allegedly fraudulent financial statements with the SEC, or
recklessly disregarding evidence that the documents might be
false.
   Mr. Anderson, ZZZZBest's financial chief from July 1986 to
July 1987, agreed to a permanent injunction barring him from
engaging in violations of securities laws.
   The company's founder, Barry Minkow, was convicted last
year on various counts in connection with a scheme to bilk
investors and banks of more than $100 million. He is serving
a 25-year sentence. Mr. Anderson was not a defendant in the
criminal proceedings.
