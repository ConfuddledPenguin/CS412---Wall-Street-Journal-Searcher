   I have been president of the Riverside Church Board of
Trustees for three years and chair of the finance committee,
which oversees the investment portfolio, for six years. I am
an investment banker by profession. I probably know more
about Riverside's finances than any other single person. Your
Aug. 1 page-one article leaves a seriously misleading
impression of the church's finances. You certainly know the
difference between nominal and real dollars, between the
early and the late 1970s, and between deficits and debts. Yet
the article confuses these concepts and omits the most
salient facts of Riverside's financial life.
   The figure of $120 million in reference to our "endowment"
was evidently taken from a study prepared by Cambridge
Associates that presents the portfolio's value each year from
1972 to 1986 in 1986 constant dollars. In 1972, before the
bear markets that ravaged all U.S. equities in 1973 and 1974,
the portfolio would have been worth $120 million if stated in
1986 dollars; in 1972 dollars, it was worth $48 million. The
Cambridge study recommended establishing spending policies to
preserve the real purchasing power of the portfolio over the
long term. Riverside restructured its operations in 1988 to
enable it to do exactly that; the portfolio's annual cash
contribution to the operating budget is set at a level that
should preserve the portfolio's real -- i.e., constant dollar
-- value. I expect the audited results for the year ended
June 30, 1990, to show that the portfolio's current market
value is more than $73 million, its highest level ever.
("Endowment" inaccurately describes our portfolio; most of
our funds are not true endowment.)

   Riverside's annual spending from the portfolio is limited
to an economically sustainable level. The level allows us to
operate an expensive building and an extensive program,
although we must be frugal. It is true that our vision of the
Christian life leads us to want to do more than our current
resources allow. However, would it not be a much more serious
problem if our resources exceeded our vision?

   Please note that Riverside Church is
"inter-denominational," not "non-denominational." We are
registered in New York State as a Baptist Church, and have
official ties to the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.
and the United Church of Christ.
