   DALLAS -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, in an
effort to cut costs as the thrift industry constricts, is
selling its headquarters to a unit of GTE Corp. and moving to
less plush leased space.
   Neither party would disclose the sale price, but FHLB's
president, George Barclay, said investment of the proceeds,
combined with a reduction in other office expenses, "will
have a favorable impact on the bank's profitability."

   Mr. Barclay is one of the presidents of the 12 Federal
Home Loan Banks who has sounded alarms about the declining
profitability of the banks. The banks' major source of
revenue is loans, or advances, to member thrifts. But demand
for advances has declined as thrifts have cut their
borrowings in efforts to shrink to meet stringent capital
standards.
   "Selling the headquarters and moving into leased office
space is in the best interests of the bank and our member
insititutions," Mr. Barclay said yesterday.
   The FHLB headquarters, comprising about 200,000 square
feet in two buildings, is being sold to GTE Southwest Inc.,
one of the four area operating companies of GTE Telephone
Operations.
   A spokeswoman for GTE Southwest said the company will move
about 585 employees into the buildings in late 1991, when the
company's current leases expire.
