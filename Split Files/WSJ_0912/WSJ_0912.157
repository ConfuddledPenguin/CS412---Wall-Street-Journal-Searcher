   WASHINGTON -- President Bush declared that "Saddam Hussein
will fail" in his occupation of Kuwait and that a new world
order will emerge from the crisis.
   In a nationally televised address to Congress, Mr. Bush
used some of his bluntest language yet in asserting that the
U.S. won't ever accept Iraq's occupation of Kuwait --
language that will make it tough for the U.S. to back away
from that stand.

   "Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait," Mr. Bush
declared. "That's not a threat. That's not a boast. That's
just the way it's going to be."
   Mr. Bush offered no new plan or timetable for getting Iraq
out of Kuwait. He said the economic sanctions against Baghdad
"will take time to have their full intended effect." In the
meantime, he added, the U.S. will review "all options" -- a
phrase the administration uses to refer to possible military
attack.
   If Iraqi officials had hoped Mr. Bush might soften his
stand to pave the way for a negotiated settlement of the
crisis, the hopes must have been shattered by the speech, the
most important of his two-year-old presidency.
   He declared the U.S. won't let "one so ruthless" as Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein dominate the world oil market. And
he said Washington won't let Iraq deter U.S. policy by
holding hundreds of hostages in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   "America and the world must stand up to aggression, and we
will," Mr. Bush said. "And one thing more: In the pursuit of
these goals, America will not be intimidated."
   Mr. Bush's speech wasn't designed to offer any new
initiatives to resolve the crisis, but rather was part of a
campaign to maintain domestic support by regularly
reiterating his case for taking a tough stand. Mr. Bush also
pressed Congress to solve the U.S.'s chronic budget deficit,
saying that doing so is necessary if the U.S. wants to
continue leading the world.
   He called on Congress to pass four ambitious items this
month: legislation with "growth-oriented tax measures"; a
five-year plan to reduce the budget deficit; a new military
spending plan; and measures to increase domestic energy
independence.
   In their official response to the president, congressional
Democrats gave Mr. Bush unqualified support for his Persian
Gulf initiative, but they indicated some differences over his
domestic agenda.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said U.S.
troops are in the Persian Gulf "because it is right," and he
echoed Mr. Bush's uncompromising language toward Iraq. But
his remarks also suggested that other nations, especially
Germany and Japan, haven't done enough to support the effort.
He also emphasized his party's differences with Mr. Bush over
the budget talks, saying that just as wealthy nations should
shoulder part of the cost of the military action, wealthy
Americans should pay their "fair share" of the cost of
reducing the deficit.
   In his address, Mr. Bush repeated the four goals he set
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait: unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait; restoration of Kuwait's ousted
government; security of other Persian Gulf countries, and
protection of Americans abroad.
   Mr. Bush also added a fifth goal: establishment of a "new
world order" in which East and West unite to prevent
aggression against smaller nations by larger and more
powerful ones.
   Speaking two days after a meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr. Bush said of the Iraqi invasion: "This
is the first assault on the new world that we seek, the first
test of our mettle. Had we not responded to this first
provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to
demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual
and potential despots around the world."
   Mr. Bush said the 100,000 U.S. soldiers dispatched to
Saudi Arabia, as well as those sent by other nations, are in
the oil-rich kingdom to "deter and if need be, to defend
against attack" by Iraq.
   But he also seemed to expand goals beyond that by
asserting that part of the U.S. role in the Persian Gulf is
to "curb the proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic
missile and, above all, nuclear technologies." Mr. Bush
hasn't said he might use the crisis as an opportunity to
destroy Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons programs, but
some members of Congress have urged him to consider doing so.
   Mr. Bush also made one of his plainest declarations yet
that he won't let the plight of hostages affect policy
decisions.
   Speaking of the Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait, Mr.
Bush said: "Of course, our hearts go out to the hostages and
to their families. But our policy cannot change. And it will
not change. America and the world will not be blackmailed by
this ruthless policy."
   In an attempt to head off congressional criticism that
allies aren't bearing more of the burden of Mideast effort,
Mr. Bush declared that "most of our friends" have given a
"good" response to U.S. appeals that they foot more of the
bill for the dispatch of U.S. troops and give more aid to
nations hurt by the trade embargo.
   Mr. Gephardt singled out Germany and Japan for failing to
do enough to support the U.S. military effort, even though,
he said, they depend far more on Mideast oil than the U.S.
   "When Bangladesh is putting troops in harm's way, so
should our properous and powerful allies," said the Missouri
Democrat. He added that when Americans can stand on the front
lines "only miles from the threat of poison gas, the least
the Japanese and Germans can do is support us -- and not just
with words; they must respond to our potential sacrifice of
lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their own."
   Mr. Gephardt also argued that despite the Gulf action,
cuts in defense spending can be made, particularly for such
costly weapons as the B-2 "Stealth" bomber and the Strategic
Defense Initiative, or Star Wars.
   Mr. Gephardt's remarks reiterated a Democratic position
that could become controversial. "Star Wars, the B-2 bomber
and the MX missile are costly systems designed for a Cold War
that we have already won," he said. "We can and must reduce
the part of the Pentagon budget that is nothing more than
shadow boxing with the past."
   Mr. Bush avoided references to specific defense programs,
simply declaring that "this is no time to risk America's
capacity to protect her vital interests" by cutting defense
too deeply.
   Mr. Bush's use of the occasion to press for his domestic
agenda -- including a capital gains tax reduction -- angered
some people. "I thought the reference to capital gains was
particularly inappropriate at a time when working-class kids
have their butts on the line in Saudi Arabia," said Rep.
David Obey (D., Wis.).
   The reaction of the diplomatic corps to the speech was
restrained. The Iraqi ambassador to the U.S., Mohammed Sadiq
al-Mashat, showed little response.
