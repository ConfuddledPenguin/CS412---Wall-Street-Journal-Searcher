   Compaq Computer Corp. reduced by up to 20% the suggested
retail prices for several of its desktop personal computers.
   The computer retailer, based in Houston, reduced the
suggested price of the Deskpro 386/25e Model 120 from $8,499
to $6,999, the 386s Model 1 from $2,799 to $2,499, and the
286n Model 40 from $2,599 to $2,399. Compaq also lowered
prices of more than a dozen other 386 models.

   It said the reductions would allow it to take advantage of
fourth-quarter market growth and accelerated movement toward
386-based and 386sx-based personal computers.
   Compaq's president, Joseph R. Canion, noted that Compaq
needed to keep its prices in line with its major competitor,
International Business Machines Corp.
   Compaq was able to reduce prices because of price cuts in
such parts as microprocessors and disk drives.
   The company also reduced by about 25% the price of nine
memory options for its computers.
