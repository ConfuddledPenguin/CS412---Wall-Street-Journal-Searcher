   If Saddam Hussein persists in flouting United Nations
demands to return Kuwait to its rightful government, he
should be told that combat aircraft will be allowed to fly in
Kuwaiti airspace only if permitted by the Kuwaiti government.
Preferably the news should come from the Kuwaiti government,
whose right to self defense the U.N. is invoking. Iraqi
combat aircraft on the ground -- fighters on the three
Kuwaiti airfields able to support them, as well as
helicopters -- would be permitted to leave Kuwait under
escort or stay put on the ground. Fighters penetrating from
Iraq would be subject to interception and hot pursuit.
   Blocking Saddam's use of Kuwaiti airspace would accomplish
directly and immediately an important part of the president's
-- and the U.N.'s -- goal of getting Iraq out of the whole of
Kuwait; it would make accomplishing the rest not easy, but
significantly easier.

   In another measure, Saddam would be told that the Kuwaitis
are retrieving their authority to allow aircraft of friendly
governments to use Kuwaiti airspace. If Iraqi surface-to-air
missiles (SAMs) attack aircraft legitimately using Kuwaiti
airspace, we would disable not only the sites launching the
attack, but all missile sites in Kuwait capable of
interfering with the use of Kuwaiti airspace.
   The measures proposed need not be applied in sequence.
Disabling the SAM launchers used to attack our aircraft might
be necessary in any case in order to enforce the first
measure's injunction against bringing fighters in from Iraq,
and in order to ground Iraqi helicopters based in less
accessible places than the three jet fields close to Saudi
Arabia and the coast. Our dominance of the air over Kuwait
would permit our helicopters to land Kuwaiti resistance
fighters and greatly improve their ability to harass and
hinder the resupply of Iraqi military forces now in Kuwait.
Both measures would increase the pressure on Saddam to get
out of Kuwait and would make his invasion of Saudi Arabia
even harder.
   There is a third measure that can break the deadlock,
worth weighing soberly but urgently. It would involve using
the air blockade to isolate and cut the overland
reinforcement of Iraqi ground forces now concentrated in the
southeast of Kuwait, where they threaten the Saudi oil
fields. The goal would be to cut also their resupply by road.
(The present naval blockade stops the resupply by sea of
Iraqi forces in Kuwait, but only as a byproduct -- less
focused on the military and on Kuwait -- of a wider effort to
stop shipments to all territory controlled by Iraq. We are
not recommending an air blockade now of all Iraq).
   Even more obviously than the naval blockade, which may be
effected outside of Kuwaiti territorial waters -- and which
we wholly support -- these aerial blockades would be an
exercise of the inherent Kuwaiti right of self-defense under
Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. Like the naval blockade, each
of these measures might be achieved without anyone actually
firing a shot; they leave it up to the Iraqis to accept them
-- or face a very high probability that a challenge to them
would fail. In this respect, the measures contrast with our
initiating an invasion on the ground in Kuwait or a strategic
bombing offensive against Iraq.
   Despite the lengthening odds, Saddam might invade Saudi
Arabia and attack our forces there. Then clearly the U.S. and
its partners would want to consider options extending far
beyond reclaiming Kuwaiti airspace. Nor has President Bush
ruled out any military option, including our own initiation
of a ground force invasion at some later date. These measures
focus on Kuwait, but they do not imply that any area of Iraq
will be a sanctuary in a war. Nor do they imply that we would
"escalate" actions gradually in such a war. Nor that in that
war we would aim for less than a decisive destruction of
Iraqi military forces and installations. For now, however, to
reclaim Kuwaiti airspace would go well beyond relying on the
present economic embargo of Iraq; and it would do that
without starting an invasion or a strategic bombing
offensive.
   Each of these measures focuses on combatants rather than
on noncombatants, whether Iraqi civilians or foreign
hostages. (Iraqi pilots flying MiG 23s are unlikely to carry
hostages as passengers.) And the measures focus tightly on
the Iraqi forces now illegally in Kuwait. All three measures
would aim at an important, but much more restricted and
precisely defined, objective than military options like the
vague calls for "carpet bombing" or a barrage of 2,700-pound
shells from the battleship Wisconsin's naval guns, or the
less obviously vague call for us to start at once a strategic
campaign "to deprive Iraq of the industrial and storage
facilities that supply its armed forces."
   The measures we propose are also more feasible -- and
would risk much less -- than a U.S. ground invasion. If the
measures supplement the naval blockade, the pressure is more
likely to wear down Saddam's will to defy the demands of the
large coalition President Bush has so skillfully assembled
before that coalition itself erodes. The larger any
coalition, the less likely it is to last without blurring or
losing its purpose -- here, getting Saddam out
unconditionally in order to show that in the future such
aggression will not pay off.
   Even the first measure, blocking Iraqi military aircraft
from any use of Kuwaiti airspace in peacetime, would
immediately reduce Saddam's ability to invade the major Saudi
oil fields, or to defend the Kuwaiti territory he has seized.
It would be a substantial, not only symbolic, break in the
deadlock. Yet the symbolic aspects in this test of wills and
endurance are entirely relevant.
   The president and his partners in this effort have staked
their credibility and that of their governments on getting
Saddam out of Kuwait unconditionally. Any concession that
Saddam exacts he can paint as a success for his invasion and
a symbolic launching platform for future aggressions.
Saddam's credibility and that of the president are not
mutually compatible. Through his spokesman, Saddam has again
and again talked of humiliating President Bush. Humiliation
is on his mind. These measures -- forcing him without
concessions to give up a critical part of what he has taken
-- are humiliating. They might shorten his political life.
They are designed to do that. Nonetheless, it could be a
long, hard winter.
   In that winter, we should expect a Saddam television show,
not of Iraqi soldiers, but of starving Iraqi and hostage
children. Saddam's care for "pretty children," like a cat's
for a mouse, is lethal. His public diplomacy abounds in
references to body bags. Saddam is not exactly a diplomat in
the mold of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
He is even less like such figures on the American scene as
Ambassador Sol Linowitz, who believes Saddam responded to
diplomacy with "flexibility" when he disgorged the last
residue of what he swallowed by invading Iran. Saddam,
however, was yielding not to Iran's diplomacy but to a U.S.
show of force: He has had to transfer Iraqi forces from his
Iranian border to better the odds we've been piling up to get
him out of Kuwait.
   For all his unlimited ambition, brutality and unyielding
bluster, Saddam has shown in other ways that he will bow to
plainly overwhelming force and the will to use it. He had
issued standing orders to his tanker captains to resist
boarding or be shot. When it was plain they would be boarded,
he told them not to resist.
   He shows signs of increasing awareness of the
vulnerability of his forces in Kuwait. He has already
withdrawn Republican Guards, his most effective ground
forces, and replaced them with members of the People's Army,
lower in morale. He has brought in Soviet SA-2s and SA-3s,
but he appears not to be putting many of his
highest-performance SAMs in Kuwait. He is cutting his losses
in case he is forced out. In short, while digging in, Saddam
seems also poised to get out. But he will leave Kuwait
unconditionally only if it is clear that the coalition
against him can and -- especially -- that it will enforce the
U.N. demand.
   To weaken the coalition's will, Saddam is using Iraqi as
well as foreign women and children to soften the naval
blockade; and as shields to deter strategic bombing as an
alternative to the blockade. He has made it clear that if
medical supplies and food are lacking, women, children and
other noncombatants will suffer. And the first cracks in the
coalition respond to or use that humanitarian concern. China,
India and Iran now talk of sending food and medical supplies.
   In the broadcast of his visit with Western hostages, he
said that Iraqis working in economic and "scientific" (i.e.,
chemical and nuclear) installations live on or near those
installations and "some pretty children, just as pretty as
the children we have here" would be at risk. His purpose is
to make any attack on military installations and combatants
inevitably an attack on noncombatants.
   For that reason, as well as on obvious moral grounds, the
three measures we propose would confine effects as much as
possible to the military forces rather than civilians. A
complete separation from civilians isn't feasible. But there
is a large difference between carpet bombing of military
targets embedded in population centers on the one hand, and,
on the other, intercepting a jet fighter or homing in on the
radiation from a SAM radar with 50 pounds of explosive or
cutting precisely an isolated road used as a supply line to
Iraqi troops in southeast Kuwait.
   Only staffs with the most recent data on the performance
and location of the varied aircraft and missiles arrayed
against each other in Kuwait can speak with any finality on
these matters. We hope that they will test, flesh out and
improve the three measures we outline. However, something
more can be said about the three measures proposed to break
the deadlock.
   First, keeping Iraqi jet fighters from using Kuwaiti
airfields should be possible with minimal danger to our
aircraft, our air crews, or civilian bystanders. These three
airfields are nearly 100 miles from Iraq, but so close to the
Saudi border or to the coast that aircraft flying from these
fields could be destroyed by air-to-air missiles fired from
aircraft that would hardly need themselves to penetrate
Kuwaiti airspace. The coalition now has in the Gulf airborne
warning and control aircraft, including the British Nimrod,
as well as the U.S. E-3 Sentry flown by the Saudis and
Americans, that can stay far back from Kuwait and detect,
identify and track all aircraft flying from these fields --
and from Iraq.
   We have also brought aircraft with air-to-air and
air-to-surface missiles with powerful radar or infrared
sensors, as well as decoys and missiles that can jam or
deceive passive sensors, that can home in on active sensors,
and that can jam communications. We can disable
surface-to-air missiles that would interfere with our
destruction of military helicopters rising from pads close to
Iraq, or our interception of aircraft from Iraq. While the
U.S. has brought in the preponderance of air power now in the
Gulf, in quality and quantity, the British and French have
qualitatively excellent air power and can contribute some
technologically ingenious capabilities that we have
neglected.
   The air power assembled in the Gulf appears able to carry
out the second measure, to gain air dominance by finding and
rendering ineffective essentially all SAMs, even those that
have been moved and are being recalibrated to make them
operational. During testing or operation, radar or radio
emissions would reveal their location. Powerful optical and
infrared sensors on board both aircraft and satellites could
locate them. Stealth aircraft would have a particular
advantage in finding them and destroying them at night. Some
normally accurate missiles would go astray. They would do
some unintended harm. Some aircraft would be lost, but
dominance of the air over Kuwait would permit an even more
precise application of force by the resistance, as well as
from the air.
   The third measure, to reduce reinforcement and supply for
Iraqi forces as a way of inducing them to leave, might be
achieved without Saddam compelling us to spread the harm to a
great many Iraqi and foreign civilians. With the worst will
in the world, Saddam would find it hard to keep live hostages
at all the points we might usefully attack and reattack on
the sparse, desert roadnet needed to resupply the huge army
he has concentrated in southeast Kuwait.
   That army is already reported to be troubled by dysentery,
cholera and other problems associated with sanitation and
food and water supply. Cutting its supply of fuel would
reduce its ability to fight a war. Cutting its supply of
water would make it difficult simply to stay there. We should
tighten the tourniquet as close as possible to the Iraqi
armed forces and as far away as feasible from the
concentration of population in the Al Kuwait metropolitan
area and the thin settlements along the coast. How to beat
Saddam in a contest in which we try to focus effects on
military forces in Kuwait, while he tries to make us hurt
civilians, is the right question to pose to the responsible
staff.
   If we're clear enough about the nature of this contest, we
should be able to enforce the reclaiming of Kuwaiti airspace,
even if Saddam challenges it -- and do that with air power
focused discriminately enough on Saddam's military forces to
maintain the coalition's resolve to get Saddam out of the
whole of Kuwait without rewarding his aggression. That would
accomplish part of the president's immediate objective. But
the president intends his immediate objectives to serve
larger interests and goals, which now need clarifying if the
domestic consensus is not to fall apart. The current muddled
debate in the media makes visible some of the potential
cracks.
