   A single European currency has much to recommend it, but
the European Community obviously still lacks the political
unity necessary for its creation. That was evident in Rome
this past weekend, as Britain sidetracked the express train
known as European Monetary Union. This probably is best seen
as a case of the ideal having to yield to the merely
possible. The underlying problem, of course, is the
widespread doubt over who would actually control the EMU.
   Germany's Karl Otto Poehl, director of the Bundesbank,
helped the U.K., Spain and some smaller nations at the Rome
meeting put a spoke in the wheel of the plan promoted by the
European Community's president, Jacques Delors. Early this
year, Mr. Poehl had said, in effect, that so far as he is
concerned a European central bank, and common currency, are
fine, providing that such a bank would run monetary policy as
well as does the Bundesbank.

   The value of money -- any money -- is based on confidence.
The Bundesbank, through careful and apolitical management of
the deutsche mark, has generated such confidence. Other major
currencies have fared less well. Confidence in the dollar
isn't everything it should be and that no doubt can be
attributed, among other things, to a world-wide perception
that Congress and the Treasury have created a major fiasco in
the U.S. Savings and Loan industry.
   France went into the Rome meeting full of hope for support
of a move into stage two of the Delors plan. There were
expectations that stage two's transfer of monetary authority
to a European entity from national central banks could begin
on Jan. 1, 1993. A single currency might be achieved five
years later, it was believed. But after this weekend's Rome
meeting there now are doubts that such a goal could be
reached before the year 2000, if then.
   One of the merits of a plan that has been proposed by
British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major is that it
recognizes the importance of public confidence. It would
create a 13th currency, called the "hard ECU," which would be
available for public use and could be spent or used to settle
debts in any EC country.
   Its creation theoretically would not inflate the total
European money supply, since national currencies would be
exchanged for it. There would be an attempt to keep it sound
and attractive. If that succeeded, the combination of public
confidence and convenience gradually would increase the use
of the ECU, and decrease the use of national currencies.
   Mr. Poehl, even as he supports the slower evolution
inherent in the Major plan, apparently isn't keen about the
13th-currency idea. As the proprietor of Europe's leading
central bank, he obviously feels the need to be convinced of
the idea's soundness before putting his weight behind it.
   So the level of confidence in the Major plan is not yet
high enough to guarantee implementation. Yet it is not
impossible that it could gain support in the months ahead, as
EC governments prepare for a December meeting to work out a
draft treaty on monetary union. Adoption of something along
the lines of the Major plan, particularly if it would bring
Britain into the EMU fold, wouldn't necessarily be the worst
solution in the world.
