   TOKYO -- Japan's largest computer maker is jumping into a
small but growing market currently dominated by two American
companies.
   Fujitsu Ltd. announced it will start selling so-called
fault-tolerant computers, which keep running even if a part
fails. Such machines have spread rapidly among financial
firms, and are catching on for broader on-line systems, such
as airline-reservations networks.

   Tadashi Sekizawa, Fujitsu's president, said at a news
conference that it's crucial for the company to enter this
market if it's to be a "total systems supplier."
   Although the company will initially target mainly Japan
and other Pacific Rim countries, the move has significance
for the American computer industry. The rapid growth in Japan
of Tandem Computers Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., and Stratus
Computer Inc. of Marlboro, Mass. -- the fault-tolerant
industry leaders -- is often cited as a rare illustration of
successful foreign penetration in a market that tends to
favor home-grown technologies.
   Tandem's annual Japanese revenue, for example, has grown
nearly sixfold in five years to 20 billion yen ($143.5
million) in the fiscal year ending this month. Its Japan
operations now make up just under 10% of the company's total
sales.
   Now that an established Japanese company is offering a
competing product, that growth could slow down. "Fujitsu
maintains big customers in key industries such as banking,
distribution, and manufacturing," said Yuji Ogino, managing
director of International Data Corp.'s Tokyo office. "Fujitsu
will definitely grab the lion's share."
   Shares of both Tandem and Stratus were hard hit yesterday.
Tandem stock tumbled $2.125 to close at $11.50, while Stratus
fell $1 to close at $15.625, both in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   Spokesmen for both Hitachi Ltd. and NEC Corp. -- Japan's
two largest mainframe computer companies -- said they are
also seriously considering offering competing products soon.
   The U.S. market is similarly getting more competitive,
with both Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
recently announcing entries.
   Tandem officials, for their part, say they aren't worried.
"This product will not make any impact on our market," Hajime
Takayanagi, president of Tandem's Japan subsidiary, said in
an interview, adding that he didn't think Fujitsu was aiming
for the same market segment. Besides, he said, "if the
Fujitsu customers will become aware of the needs of
fault-tolerant computers, it means this will create a market,
and that's very good for us."
   The Japanese market for such fail-safe computers hasn't
grown as quickly as the U.S.'s. The Japanese computer market
is considered less developed and slower to adopt innovations.
The market is also marked by deep discounting, so users often
resort to buying full backup computers, rather than the more
efficient fault-tolerant machines, which have redundant
parts.
   But Japanese companies are now catching on. Mr. Ogino
estimates the market will likely grow 20% to 30% annually in
the next few years. The world-wide market is estimated to be
about $2.5 billion, and expected to double in four years.
