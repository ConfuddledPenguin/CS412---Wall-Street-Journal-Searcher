   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said ratification of a
four-year contract with its union workers clears the way for
the company to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection.
   The contract, ratified by the United Steel Workers of
America, calls for a $1.50-an-hour average wage increase,
which equals wage concessions union members took in 1982 and
1983 when Wheeling-Pittsburgh was short of cash because it
was building new facilities.

   The contract also calls for an average 50-cent-an-hour
increase in each of the next three years; a $3,000 signing
bonus; a $500 bonus in 1991; restoration of a service bonus;
a new profit-sharing plan; a 401(k) savings plan;
cost-of-living raises; and 50% payment of health plan
premiums.
   The company, based in Wheeling, W.Va., has been in Chapter
11 bankruptcy-law proceedings since April 15, 1985. Under
Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it
works out a reorganization plan.
