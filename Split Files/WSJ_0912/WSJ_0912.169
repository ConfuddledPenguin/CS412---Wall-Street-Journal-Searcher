   WASHINGTON -- Several senators criticized West Germany and
Japan for failing to shoulder a larger portion of the cost of
military operations in the Middle East amid signs the crisis
is likely to last at least several months.
   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in their
first public examination of the issue in detail, rebuked the
two allies for providing what they contend is token
assistance. Testifying before the panel, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney acknowleged that promised contributions "may well
be inadequate," and he indicated the administration is
determined to increase pressure for substantially greater
assistance from European and other nations.

   The tone of the comments by senators, coming on the heels
of administration announcements of significant allied
financial support, underscores increasing congressional
concern over the escalating cost and duration of the
deployment of U.S. troops, ships and planes in the Mideast.
Some Army planners, for instance, are operating under the
assumption that a major contingent of U.S. ground forces may
have to remain in Saudi Arabia for as long as two years, with
fresh troops coming into the nation every six months.
   While Secretary Cheney didn't give a specific timetable,
both his comments and the testimony of Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggest U.S.
commanders are convinced Iraq won't withdraw from Kuwait
soon. Responding to a question about whether Iraq might
attack as its economy deteriorates, Secretary Cheney said,
"We'll be able to answer that question a lot better a year
from now. . . . I don't know ultimately how it's going to be
resolved."
   Gen. Powell told the panel that the Pentagon will continue
to build up forces in the Middle East but that "we haven't
come down firmly on six months" as the time to replace
troops.
   U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia include more than 75,000
troops and nearly 1,000 helicopters, according to Pentagon
officials, with some 100 U.S. cargo vessels and Navy ships
participating in the operation. For the next few weeks or
months, Mr. Cheney said, U.S. forces will focus on thwarting
any attack by Iraq. "Certainly I have not been given any
instructions to carry out offensive action," he said. The
U.S. role "may well involve a longer term commitment than we
expected" before the deployment was well under way, he said.
   In his most specific projection so far, Secretary Cheney
said he expects contributions from Arab nations and other
allies to cover about half of the roughly $15 billion annual
cost of maintaining U.S. troops, planes and ships in Saudi
Arabia and nearby waters. "The response to date has been more
than we have ever gotten before" from allies, Mr. Cheney
said, "but it may well be inadequate."
   Last week, other administration officials indicated that
contributions from Arab states would be enough to cover most
of the extra costs.
   Members of the committee were eager to criticize the level
of foreign assistance, even as many of them maneuvered to
garner credit for providing free mailing privileges, imminent
danger pay, income-tax waivers and other benefits to the
troops in Saudi Arabia. Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), the main
sponsor of one such bill, said it would add an estimated $700
million to the overall annual cost of the operation.
   Noting that West Germany has agreed to provide as much as
$8 billion to subsidize Soviet troops remaining in East
Germany, Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) accused Bonn of
offering "little more than pocket-change" to help refugees
and resolve the crisis in the Middle East. Sen. John McCain
(R., Ariz.) called promises of West German contributions
"almost an insult," which he warned could "dramatically erode
the very strong relationship" between Washington and Bonn.
   The Japanese government, which previously pledged $1
billion to help the effort against Iraq and is now
considering giving another $2 billion to Egypt, Turkey and
Jordan -- the nations hit hardest by the economic sanctions
against Iraq -- also was attacked. Referring to Tokyo's claim
that it is legally barred from providing substantial
assistance to U.S. forces in the Middle East, Sen. McCain
said, "They have proved once again that they have the world's
most flexible constitution."
   Mr. Cheney sketched a scenario in which the embargo will
soon begin to hurt the Iraqi economy badly. "We're confident
that we've been able to close off (Iraq's) ability to export
oil," he said.
   Mr. Cheney said the Pentagon was "taking measures" to
enhance protection of U.S. troops and civilians overseas and
at home because "terrorism is potentially a significant
weapon in the Iraqi arsenal." He said U.S. officials "have
received bomb threats, death threats, and verbal warnings
from international terrorist organizations."
   Meanwhile, the State Department announced that Iraq said
it would permit U.S. males born in Iraq, Kuwait or other Arab
nations to leave, along with the women and children Baghdad
has been permitting to depart. State Department Spokesman
Richard Boucher said the announcement was "an important
development. It's news that we welcome." But he added, "As we
have seen in the past, there are sometimes wrinkles inserted"
by Iraq in such offers.
   Mr. Boucher also said the U.S. is arranging for two more
charter flights to evacuate U.S. citizens from Kuwait and
Iraq, tentatively scheduled to leave Baghdad today and
Friday.
   He said about 600 Americans have been evacuated from
Kuwait and Iraq so far and estimated that about 1,700 U.S.
citizens remained in Kuwait and about 100 in Iraq.
