   Investors drove down the price of TransCanada PipeLines
Ltd. stock in heavy trading yesterday after BCE Inc.
announced late Monday a pact to sell its 48.8% stake to a
group of investment dealers for about 1.3 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.1 billion).
   TransCanada's shares closed at US$13.25, down US$1.125, on
relatively light volume in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, the stock closed at
C$15.375, down C$1.50, on volume of about 4.4 million shares,
making it by far the day's most actively traded issue there.

   Analysts said the steep decline in the stock's price
reflects worries that the market will soon be flooded with
TransCanada shares as dealers resell their holdings to the
public after the transaction closes next month.
   "The market seems to be balking at the prospect of
TransCanada having a larger public float, and is perhaps
reading something into the timing of the sale," said Winfried
Fruehauf, an energy consultant and analyst with Toronto's
Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon Inc. "This isn't exactly an act of
faith by BCE" in the Calgary, Alberta, pipeline company, he
said.
   But a spokesman for TransCanada, the country's largest
natural gas pipeline operator, said the planned two-step sale
of BCE's 75 million TransCanada shares won't affect its
operations, or impede its C$2.57 billion expansion program.
   "About all it means is that we are losing a shareholder.
This will not impair our ability to raise capital" for the
previously proposed expansion of TransCanada's system in
1991-1992, he said, which is currently awaiting Canadian
regulatory approval.
   Canada's National Energy Board, the federal agency that
must approve TransCanada's bid to add almost 1,000 miles of
pipeline and 832 million cubic feet of natural gas
transportation capacity a day to its system, is expected by
November to decide whether to approve the company's toll rate
proposal. Approval would set the stage for the first part of
TransCanada's expansion to proceed, the company spokesman
said.
   Analysts appeared less certain that TransCanada will be
able to sell new equity to finance its expansion, without the
backing of its major shareholder. "They'll have to finance
their future offerings of primary equity from the market at
large, in a market already glutted with TransCanada paper,"
said James Doak, analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd.
   While investors in TransCanada reacted with dismay,
holders of BCE, the Montreal-based parent of Bell Canada,
reacted with a yawn. In Big Board composite trading, BCE
shares closed at $30.875, up 12.5 cents.
   Montreal money manager Stephen Jarislowsky said his firm
recently sold most of its BCE stock and that the company's
decision to sell its TransCanada stake isn't enough to tempt
him back. Always leery of BCE's diversification over the past
few years, Mr. Jarislowsky said the new, slimmer BCE still
has to prove itself. "I feel a bit sorry for the incumbent
{management} because they have to clean up the mess," Mr.
Jarislowsky said.
   BCE is loathe to call the decision to exit the pipeline
business a reversal in strategy. BCE spokesman David Orr said
that when BCE decided to branch out in the 1980s its core
telephone business was seen as a mature industry. Now it's
anything but.
   Telecommunications "has changed rapidly, much more rapidly
than people thought," Mr. Orr said. "We {decided} we have to
focus on our core telecommunications businesses."
   BCE also wants to be ready to grab opportunities overseas,
Mr. Orr said, pointing to Australia's decision this week to
open up telecommunications services to competition as an
example of the changes in the industry. BCE has experience
overseas. It helped Saudi Arabia build its phone system and
is currently involved in a cellular venture in Mexico and
cable television in the U.K.
   After selling off its TransCanada stake BCE will be left
with its Bell Canada unit, a 53% stake in Northern Telecom
Ltd. and a recently acquired financial services unit,
Montreal Trustco Inc. Mr. Orr said BCE sees financial
services as a good fit with telecommunications.
