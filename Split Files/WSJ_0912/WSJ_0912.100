   In your Aug. 23 article "Call-Up Leaves Reservists, Bosses
Asking How it Works" you said, "However, military law holds
armed forces personnel responsible for their debts, and wages
can be garnisheed to pay them." In fact, the only debts for
which the Air Force is authorized to garnishee wages are
child support and alimony. You are correct, however, that
military law does hold its members responsible for a failure
to pay just debts.
