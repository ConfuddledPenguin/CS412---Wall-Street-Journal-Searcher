   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- CyCare Systems Inc. said it would buy
back as many as 500,000 shares, or about 9% of the shares
outstanding, from time to time on the open market.
   The company, which had about $3.3 million in cash on hand
for the second quarter ended June 30, said it was initiating
the buy-back because it feels the stock is undervalued. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CyCare
stock closed at $5.625, up 12.5 cents, near its low for the
year. The stock's high for 1990 was $10.375.

   CyCare said it would use the stock for employee stock
option and incentive plans. The buy-back follows last year's
program, when the company bought 420,000 shares, or 18% of
its shares, for $6 a share from Hospital Corp. of America.
   CyCare provides computerized processing, services and
systems to the health-care industry.
