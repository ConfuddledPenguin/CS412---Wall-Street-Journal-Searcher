   Norton, a Worcester, Mass., abrasives maker, is fighting
the tender offer; the company is looking for an alternative
suitor or investor to thwart BTR's bid. The company has also
lobbied Massachusetts lawmakers to pass a law that could
delay the installation of new directors in the proxy fight
BTR is waging against Norton. The proxy vote is scheduled at
an annual meeting April 26.
   BTR, a British conglomerate, also said it has extended the
tender offer until 9 p.m. eastern time April 27. The offer
was scheduled to expire at midnight April 12.
