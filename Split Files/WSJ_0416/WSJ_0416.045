   SAN FRANCISCO -- Six months after the earthquake, San
Francisco's $3.4 billion-a-year tourist trade, the city's
largest industry, is still feeling aftershocks.
   Merchants in Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf report
business remains down since the Oct. 17 quake. They blame
lingering fears that have scared off leisure travelers, and
still-damaged freeways that are causing regional visitors to
go elsewhere for entertainment and shopping.

   Spring, the season of the Chinese New Year, is typically
the busiest time of year in Chinatown. But businesses there
have seen sales drop 15% to 40%, says Rose Pak, consultant to
the city's Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Restaurants, gift
shops, and even small Chinese bakeries and produce markets
have been affected, she says.
   "Besides the overall decline in tourists, there's been a
decided drop in bedroom-community business," says Ms. Pak.
"It's too cumbersome now. We're worried the change in pattern
will become a habit, and they'll never come in anymore."
   "It's truly a mess to come into the city and drive
around," says Al Falchi, owner of the Waterfront restaurant,
which has seen business fall about 10%. "There are so many
detours, you don't know where you're going."
   Businesses have been hurt by the closure since the quake
of the major freeway artery leading to Chinatown, Fisherman's
Wharf and North Beach, a popular neighborhood dominated by
Italian restaurants.
   To repair and strengthen the existing double-decker
freeway structure would cost about $32 million and take about
eight months. But Mayor Art Agnos has suggested a plan to
raze the structure and replace it with an underground
freeway, which would cost between $100 million and $120
million, and take about five years to complete.
   The current structure, built in the late 1950s, "would be
considered a monstrosity on the Thames or the Seine," says
Art Silverman, the mayor's deputy press secretary. "The mayor
feels the earthquake has given us the opportunity to get rid
of an eyesore." Tearing it down would ease safety concerns,
he says, and the city believes federal funds would pay for
most of the proposed new project.
   San Francisco's board of supervisors is scheduled to vote
on the mayor's proposal today. But Ms. Pak says at least 700
Chinatown merchants will be shutting down their businesses to
attend the meeting and oppose the proposal.
   Most city hotels suffered only minor earthquake damage,
and are in full operation, though occupancy rates are down.
(The Hyatt Regency at the San Francisco Airport, however, has
been closed since the quake for repairs and reinforcement. It
is scheduled to reopen July 1.)
   Occupancy fell sharply after the quake; Fisherman's Wharf
hotels, which before the quake boasted the city's highest
occupancy rates, were down 7% for the year, says Jay Scott,
hotel analyst with Laventhol &amp; Horwath. Citywide, the
occupancy rate for 1989 was 70%, compared with 72% the year
before. For the first quarter of this year, the rate was 68%.
   Convention and business travel has rebounded, although
fewer spouses are coming along for the trip. Independent
tourists, who account for about a third of hotel rooms, "have
been very reluctant to come back," Mr. Scott says. Besides
quake fears, he says overall belt-tightening in travel, and
higher airfares, may have contributed to the drop in leisure
travelers. The prime tourist season, now approaching, "will
tell how much the memory of the quake has faded and how good
a marketing job the city has done."
   Even though some merchants have tripled marketing budgets,
"there's no question some may close their doors," says
Alessandro Baccari, executive secretary of the Fisherman's
Wharf Association, which represents major retailers and 144
restaurants. Despite trying gimmicks ranging from a fish
festival to a live satellite telecast from the Wharf to
Australia, merchants have seen business fall 25% to 30%.
   Even a half-year later, San Francisco still finds it tough
to counter the television images of the fire and devastated
homes in the Marina district, and of the Bay Bridge. "The
media showed the same pictures, over and over," Mr. Baccari
complains. "People say `My God, you've sunk into the bay, the
whole city's destroyed . . . We keep saying, `We're all
right. We want you. We need you.' "
   Mother Nature shouldn't take all the blame for tourism
woes, says Sharon Rooney, spokeswoman for the San Francisco
Convention and Visitors Bureau. "People are laying things at
foot of earthquake that don't belong there." Part of the
reason for lower occupany rates may be that about 2,000 new
hotel rooms have been added in the city in less than a year.
The San Francisco Marriott, the city's second-largest hotel
with 1,500 rooms, opened the day of the earthquake.
   Yet, she concedes misconceptions continue to hurt tourism.
She recently received a clip from a Texas newspaper reporting
that the Golden Gate bridge was back up. (The Bay Bridge,
which links San Francisco to Oakland, was damaged by the
quake. The Golden Gate bridge was intact.) "People see our
skyline and think, `Those buildings are going to fall on me.'
We know that the buildings swing. Other people have to be
educated."
   And despite the perception, based on erroneous early
reports, that hundreds died in the quake, she notes 62 people
were actually killed, 13 of them in San Francisco. And she
adds, "not a single tourist was injured. We're trying to
stress that."
