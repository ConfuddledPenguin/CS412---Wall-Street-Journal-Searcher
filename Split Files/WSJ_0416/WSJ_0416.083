   The distributor of phone systems charged $18 million to
close a plant and to restructure its Canadian operation; $7.5
million to write down inventory; $6.8 million for "domestic
restructuring charges on operations"; and $21.7 million for
intangible assets.
   A spokeswoman for TIE was unavailable for elaboration.
   On Wednesday, TIE announced that it bought the preferred
stock held by HCR Partners, an affiliate of Chicago's
Pritzker family, for $46.5 million of notes. The company paid
$15 million of this Friday. The rest is payable over six
years, with the first payment due May 1, 1991.
   HCR also received warrants to buy one million TIE common
shares.
