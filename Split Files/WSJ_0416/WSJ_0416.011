   Lexington, Ky. -- April is when Kentucky Derby candidates
emerge from the mist, and on Saturday afternoon, at bucolic
Keeneland, one did. He is Summer Squall, and his bid must be
classed as serious if only because he emerged not only from
the mist, but also from the rain, cold and mud.
   The smallish, dark colt, who was bred, auctioned and first
sent trackward in the Blue Grass state, won the 1 1/8-mile
Blue Grass Stakes, worth $185,000, over a small but
interesting field. His victory was notable because it was his
seventh in eight outings, because he spent the entire race in
the close and threatening company of his colleagues and,
again, because he prevailed in circumstances that must have
made a warm barn seem tempting.

   His trainer, heavy-browed Neil Howard, appeased the turf
gods by allowing that one never knows what's gonna happen in
the Big One for three-year-olds-that Louisville race on the
first Saturday in May. But he added that, in the meantime,
he'd rather be in his own shoes than anyone else's.
   "I like our chances -- I really do," Howard declared.
"Summer Squall has never run a bad race, and he doesn't have
to take his race track with him." The latter is track talk
for an animal's ability to handle different surfaces and
conditions.
   Pat Day, the winner's jockey, voiced similar sentiments.
"I have tremendous confidence in this colt," he said. "He can
run off or on the lead, and has courage under fire. He showed
that last summer when he won the Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga
after being jostled. He showed it today, too."
   There are, of course, other trainers and jockeys, at other
courses, who are saying much the same things about their
steeds, which ought to make for some lively office pools come
next month. As things stand, Summer Squall should enter the
gate on Derby Day as no worse than the people's second
choice, perhaps, behind unbeaten Mister Frisky. That's the
$15,000 bargain who ran his early races in unfashionable
Puerto Rico before showing he also could win on the mainland,
most lately in the Santa Anita Derby.
   This year's Beast of the East is Champagneforashley, who
won a fast 7/8-mile by a wide margin Friday in New York, but
hasn't been tested sternly at longer distances. C etc.
probably will run again before the Derby, while Summer Squall
and Mister Frisky are slated for R &amp; R, so he might attract
the custom of folks with short memories if he shows
impressively again.
   A fourth, and nouveau, Derby hopeful is the Blue Grass
runnerup, Land Rush. His credentials going into Saturday were
a meager two wins in eight starts, and $83,000 in earnings
(to Summer Squall's $600,000), and he went off at odds of
12-to-1 compared with 3-10 for the eventual victor. But he
poked his head in front of Summer Squall's at the 3/4-mile
mark and dogged (horsed?) SS down the homestretch before
faltering by two lengths.
   "We've got room to improve, and three weeks to do it,"
grinned D. Wayne Lucas, Land Rush's trainer. "I like the
whole scenario now."
   The scenario that brought Summer Squall to his present
wealth and fame might have been borrowed from "General
Hospital"; the nicely named offspring of Storm Bird and
Weekend Surprise has interspersed his races with trips to
infirmaries. A leg stress-fracture and nostril bleeding
caused a gap in his campaigning from late August, 1989, to
this March. That was followed by a rush to catch up that sent
him postward three times in the past month, an unusual amount
of exercise for a colt of his worth.
   That he has survived both those ordeals has endeared him
to trainer Howard. "We've asked more of the horse than we'd
normally like to, but he's never told us we shouldn't," he
noted.
   The field for the Blue Grass, which has sent 10 winners on
to acquire a rose blanket at the Kentucky Derby (but none
since Spectacular Bid in 1979), was supposed to number seven,
but was reduced to five by the weather. It would have been
cut to four had not trainer Carl Nafzger decided, just before
race time, to allow his Unbridled, the Florida Derby winner
and offspring of another Florida stakes winner, Shot Gun
Scott, to run. Nafziger explained that he preferred "soup,"
in the form of mud, to "slop," the puddles new rain leaves.
The latter condition often is toughest on horses because it
opens a track's bottom material to their hoofs.
   Summer Squall, who likes to run near the lead on land or
sea, did just that Saturday, following 50-to-1 shot Iskandar
Elakbar out of the gate. The two ran almost together until
the 3/4-mile mark, when Land Rush joined them and, briefly,
edged ahead. Summer Squall surged past at the start of the
stretch, hung for a bit until Day whipped him for the first
and only time, then won pulling away. His longest lead -- 1
3/4 lengths -- came when he crossed the finish line, no small
feat for such a hotly contested race. Unbridled rallied for
third but never threatened to win.
   Jockey Day spent part of last year aboard Easy Goer in
that colt's storied but mostly futile pursuit of
horse-of-the-year Sunday Silence. Several times he was
faulted for allowing Sunday Silence to gain leads over his
late-running mount that were to prove insurmountable. That
specter arose again on Saturday, when he let Land Rush pass
Summer Squall.
   "Pat terrified me," confessed W. Cothran Campbell, the
front man for Dogwood Stable, the 28-member partnership that
owns Summer Squall. "I was hoping he knew what his horse had
left."
   Not to worry, said Pat. "I didn't want to scare anybody,
but they don't pay off for who's ahead at the 3/8-mile pole,
or 1/4 or 1/16," he averred. Besides, "I think this colt
might be better running at horses than making the pace
himself."
   Questions remain. Can Summer Squall (or Mister Frisky,
Champagneforashley or Land Rush) handle the 1 1/4-mile Derby
distance? How about a race with some hot early speed? What
about the cavalry-charge field that's expected?
   Answers must await May 5. That's why they run the thing,
ya know.

   Due to an editing error, Shot Gun Scott was misidentified
in yesterday's On Sports piece. He was another horse in the
Blue Grass Stakes and not Unbridled's sire.
