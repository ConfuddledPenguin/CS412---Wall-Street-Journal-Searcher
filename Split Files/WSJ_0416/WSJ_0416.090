   WASHINGTON -- The fact that Emily Tull works out of her
home isn't unusual. What is unusual is who she works for.
   Mrs. Tull's employer is the federal government. A building
management specialist for the General Services
Administration, she is one of a limited number of federal
civilian employees who aren't required to punch in down at
the old Department of Whatever. But if a pilot program the
government is launching proves successful, Mrs. Tull may
eventually be joined by thousands of other federal workers
for whom "commuting" may mean little more than a trip down
the hall.

   Years after the private sector began experimenting with
the notion of telecommuting, the nation's largest employer is
belatedly about to join the trend. If all goes according to
plan, the year-long nationwide experimental program will go
into effect by August. Devised by the GSA, the Office of
Personnel Management and representatives of other federal
agencies, it will allow some 1,500 to 2,000 employees who
perform what government officials call "portable work" --
computer programmers, clerk-typists, claims examiners and
attorneys, among others -- to divide their work week between
the central office and their home or a satellite office.
   The reason the government is experimenting with the
so-called "flexiplace" (for flexible workplace) program has
less to do with government beneficence than with population
trends.
   Faced with a shrinking labor pool and rising competition
from the private sector, government officials see the
flexible workplace as a possible answer. "We needed to find a
way to enhance our ability to recruit and retain employees,"
says Wendell Joice, a personnel research psychologist at the
OPM. "We needed a carrot."
   Gil Gordon, a Monmouth Junction, N.J., telecommuting
consultant, says the government's decision to move toward a
flexible-workplace program is inevitable, given the rising
competition in the labor markets. But he warns that it isn't
a cure-all. "It's more of an issue for the federal government
because of the salary gap," he says.
   While telecommuting has grown in the private sector, it
has never met the projections of some of its more optimistic
boosters. But a successful federal program could well give
the idea a shot in the arm. "The federal government is seen
as the most staid employer," says Mr. Joice, and if it can
offer an efficient, workable telecommuting program, anyone
can.
   If anything, says Thomas Cowley, a GSA official, setting
up a flexible-workplace program is probably more complicated
for the government than it would be for most private
businesses. That is because of the extensive set of
civil-service rules and regulations under which the
government's two million civilian employees labor. These
spell out -- sometimes in very specific fashion -- such
things as scheduling, worker's compensation and appropriation
of funds for office equipment.
   According to the program's guidelines, agencies are
allowed to establish their own procedures for certifying
employee time and attendance, but those procedures must
follow standards set by the General Accounting Office's
Policy and Procedures Manual for the Guidance of Federal
Agencies.
   Figuring overtime poses another problem, especially for
lower-level employees. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act,
workers are entitled to overtime for work over 40 hours a
week, even if the extra work is voluntary, when it's
reasonable to believe the employer knew the work was being
performed. Federal workers, though, only get overtime if it
is approved by their agencies. Thus, government policy makers
setting up the flexible-workplace program will have to figure
out just what work will be paid for and what won't.
   But the officials expect that the benefits the government
will reap from the program will outweigh any such
complications. Maxcine Sterling, coordinator of the GSA's
flexiplace program, says the government expects to benefit in
a variety of ways if the program gets going in a big way.
Agencies would need less office space; employee morale would
be better; and workers who for personal reasons might
otherwise contemplate quitting might stay on.
   For instance, when the GSA's Mrs. Tull and her husband
adopted a baby last spring, she promised the baby's
birthmother that she wouldn't work outside the home. A
part-time job still would have required her to go to the
office several times a week; without some more flexible
arrangement, she says, she would have had to quit. Instead,
she says, everybody has won. She was able to keep her
promise, and "the office retained my expertise and the
training they put into me."
