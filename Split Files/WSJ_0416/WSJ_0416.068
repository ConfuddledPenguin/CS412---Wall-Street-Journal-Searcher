   NEW YORK -- Nabisco Brands Inc. said it plans to sell its
pet-snacks division to concentrate on other food lines.
   The division, which makes Milk-Bone dog biscuits, has
annual sales of about $150 million, said John Manfredi, a
senior vice president at Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc.
He described the division as "very profitable," but wouldn't
disclose earnings. The operation consists of a plant in
Buffalo, N.Y., with 275 employees, and a kennel with 12
workers.

   Mr. Manfredi said Nabisco Foods Co., the division's
parent, had reviewed the performance of all its food lines
and had decided that the pet-snacks division "didn't meet our
strategic fit."
   He said talks with potential buyers haven't started. He
declined to estimate the sale price or how long it might take
to sell the division. Mr. Manfredi added that no decision had
been made as to how proceeds from the sale would be used.
