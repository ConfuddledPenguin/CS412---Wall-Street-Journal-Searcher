   In the popular new TV series "The Simpsons" the family's
baby is noteworthy mainly for the extraordinary, nonstop
sucking sound she makes with a pacifier, which seems to have
become permanently attached to her mouth. This mysterious
phenomenon now appears to have been explained. We have just
read that the government has recalled some 47,000 baby
pacifiers. The problem with the so-called "bib to bowl"
Sterilized Pacifier is that its guards and shields don't have
air-ventilation holes, as the law requires, thereby
presenting the threat of suffocation. This surely is just the
device that Baby Simpson is attached to, and we are sure that
Homer and Marge will be the first to respond to the
government's recall and spare America from their baby's
awful, unremitting sucking.
