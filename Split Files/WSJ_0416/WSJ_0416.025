   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. said
shareholders of Novell Inc. filed a lawsuit seeking to block
Lotus's proposed takeover of Novell.
   Lotus, a computer software maker, said the investors
charged that Novell's directors breached their fiduciary duty
to Novell shareholders in reaching the agreement, suggesting
the price was inadequate. Lotus is offering 41.6 million of
its shares, with a curent market value of about $1.38
billion, for Novell, a network software maker based in Provo,
Utah.

   The shareholders claimed the suit, filed in Delaware
chancery court, qualifies as a class action on behalf of all
Novell holders. Lotus and Novell issued a statement saying
they believe the suit to be without merit.
