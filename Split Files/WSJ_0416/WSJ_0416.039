   FARMINGTON, N.M. -- This mile-high city of 37,000 has long
been a stamping ground not only for folks of law-abiding
independence, but also for small bands of fervidly contrary
tax protesters who do Uncle Sam out of his due as a matter of
principle.
   And it's here, where New Mexico's sparsely settled
northwest corner meets Arizona, Utah and Colorado, that the
first details of an insidious new trick on the Internal
Revenue Service are emerging. It's one that has led to
indictments in this state as well as to criminal
investigations nationwide.

   The tax collectors have long had to contend with cheats
and protesters who exaggerate the number of their dependents
or claim big contributions to spurious churches. But this new
strategy isn't designed to evade taxes.
   These protesters are trying to turn one of the IRS's best
enforcement weapons, the Form 1099 report of income paid,
against the tax agency itself -- and against anyone they have
a grudge against.
   Banks that pay interest, companies that pay dividends and
other payers of nonwage compensation have to tell the IRS
about it, on a Form 1099. They also send a copy to the
recipient. If the recipient doesn't reflect this income on
his federal tax return, an IRS computer flags the
discrepancy. The IRS then automatically sends a notice to the
taxpayer, and if he doesn't give a satisfactory explanation,
an audit may result.
   This matching program is an increasingly important element
of tax enforcement. Last year, the IRS got more than 750
million 1099 income statements.
   What the protesters do is file false 1099s reporting
payments of extravagant sums to unsuspecting law-enforcement
and government officials, judges and private citizens, who
would be liable for huge taxes and penalties if the reports
were true. The purpose apparently is to provoke needless
audits of the targets that could be costly and time-consuming
both for them and for the IRS. "This could be a stick of
dynamite in the system," frets Lawrence B. Gibbs, a former
IRS commissioner.
   "People who do this are trying not only to disrupt the IRS
but our whole form of government," adds William L. Lutz, the
U.S. Attorney in Albuquerque. For Mr. Lutz, it's not just a
professional concern. He and the IRS received 1099 forms
falsely reporting the payment to him of $32,334,010.58 in
1989.
   In Albany, N.Y., New York State Tax Commissioner James W.
Wetzler says he, four others in his department and an
official of another state agency found copies of false 1099s
in their mail a couple of months ago. He called the IRS. Mr.
Wetzler says he is "impressed by the speed with which the IRS
got on this case," but he declines to say more because of a
criminal investigation that has resulted.
   IRS officials in Washington don't want to talk about the
scheme, either. Among the things they won't comment on is an
indication that IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. himself
has been a target of a bogus 1099.
   The IRS does say that since about a year ago, it has
identified more than 2,000 fraudulent 1099s, received from at
least 92 sources. They have shown up in all seven of the IRS
regions and in 22 of the 64 IRS districts. The tax agency
says it means to corral the culprits, and to that end is
aggressively pursuing 40 criminal investigations in locales
around the country, which it won't name.
   The first results of these investigations have been seen
here in New Mexico. A federal grand jury in Albuquerque
handed up indictments in February alleging the filing of 49
false 1099s by four men and two women from the Farmington
area. The maximum penalty upon conviction is five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine for each fraudulent 1099.
   "For anyone who thinks this is just a prank, the
indictments in New Mexico ought to serve as a stern warning,"
says former IRS Commissioner Gibbs.
   The IRS director of public affairs, Ellen Murphy, says the
agency is concerned about a threat to the tax system. "We
want to make sure that the purity and integrity of tax data
are maintained, and we will take all necessary steps to do
that," she declares. IRS service centers have special
detection units trained to spot suspicious documents before
they get into the processing system, Ms. Murphy says. She
urges taxpayers who receive questionable 1099s to call the
IRS and ask to speak to a criminal investigator.
   What sketchy details there are about the scheme come from
Albuquerque, 180 miles southeast of here, and involve
Farmington-area people with histories of resisting federal
taxation. False 1099s first popped up in New Mexico last
summer during the tax-evasion prosecution of a couple who
eventually pleaded guilty of evasion in January. By February,
when the grand jury issued the first false-1099 indictments
(the couple weren't named), investigators had counted over
140 phony forms.
   Targets of false 1099s have included a federal judge in
Albuquerque, U.S. magistrates, IRS agents and current and
former federal prosecutors. In at least some instances, the
defendants listed themselves on 1099s sent to the IRS service
center in Austin, Texas, as payers of amounts ranging from
$26,854.55 to $16,167,005.29.
   Because both the IRS and the defendants are tight-lipped,
it is not clear why a filer of a false 1099 would give his
own name, rather than a fictitious one, as the payer. Nor is
it clear why the filer would list such a large sum, rather
than a more plausible smaller sum.
   On at least some 1099s, the filers had written "request
denied" in the box for the target's Social Security number.
There is a $50 civil penalty for failing to provide one's
number for use on a 1099.
   Two defendants are fugitives. The other four are in jail
awaiting trials that may begin next month and that may
involve unorthodox defenses. Apart from rejecting any IRS
claims, the four refuse to recognize the authority of either
the grand jury or the federal court. They demand that the
U.S. Attorney speak for them and not for the IRS. All four
stood mute at arraignments and refused legal aid; magistrates
entered not-guilty pleas for them.
   Defendant Jean R. Canon, a 47-year-old retired Air Force
master sergeant, once worked as a computer operator at San
Juan College in Farmington. He balked at having taxes
withheld from his pay and quit after the IRS put a levy on
his paycheck for back taxes three years ago. The indictment
accuses him of fraudulently claiming on 1099s to have paid
millions of dollars to 16 recipients.
   Besides a Farmington bank and two of its employees, the
named recipients include the community college, its
president, four trustees, and three college employees, among
them the payroll clerk who carried out the IRS levy.
   The payroll worker, Peggy A. Horner-Jenkins, says she
believes the blow was aimed at the college, not her. "I do
wish this situation was over with," she says. "You don't know
what they'll do next."
   The chairman of the college board of trustees, Sidney
Martin, also is the treasurer of San Juan County, where
Farmington is located. "I didn't realize how serious this
could be until I talked to my attorney," he recalls. "Then
the IRS agents told me I was lucky they got it {the 1099}
before it got into the computer."
   Mr. Canon is being held in a county detention center just
north of Albuquerque. A self-assured man of medium height and
build whose thinning dark hair falls toward thick glasses, he
denies in an interview there that he is part of any organized
group. He says he wants to know who is really behind the
confiscation of his property.
   Discussion of 1099s is off limits. But he explains in
conversational tones, "They've been using racketeering
procedures against me to avoid the truth from coming out. I'm
the injured party." He mentions that he is beginning to think
the IRS "is a tool for somebody else -- maybe somebody higher
up, maybe local."
   Clinton P. Williams, 65, and his wife, Peggy R. Williams,
are being held on charges of filing 1099s falsely reporting
income paid to Federal Judge Juan G. Burciaga of Albuquerque,
who sentenced them to prison in 1984; U.S. Attorney Lutz, and
four other public servants. The Williamses were imprisoned
after a 1984 conviction for willfully failing to file
returns. In February, during a magistrate's routine initial
presentation of the false-1099 charges, Mr. Williams objected
to the proceedings so persistently that the magistrate had
him gagged.
   The other defendant in custody is Graigory David Olson.
Officials say that the indictments against the two fugitives
are sealed.
   Last week, the grand jury added to the indictments new
charges that the defendants filed false refund claims on tax
returns last fall. Mr. and Mrs. Williams claimed a refund of
$136,384,080.10, Mr. Canon sought $29,004,625.24, and Mr.
Olson filed for $159,146.96.
   Reed L. Frost, a Farmington lawyer and part-time U.S.
magistrate, received a 1099 for $16,167,005.29 from each of
the Williamses, the indictments say. Musing generally over
obsessive tax protesters here in the Four Corners plateau
country, Mr. Frost says, "We all need something that is
important in our lives. I get the impression that this is a
cause in their lives, perhaps a moral issue."
   Mr. Williams, an erstwhile Farmington real-estate man, and
his wife list a rooming house over a Main Street billiard
parlor as their residence. But a nearby office behind the
Frontier Barber Shop in a small one-story building is the
center of their activities, and it may have yielded up to the
IRS the secret of the 1099 scheme's origins.
   Mr. and Mrs. Williams have been representatives of the
National Commodity and Barter Association, a Denver-based
organization that advocates opposition to the federal income
tax and that has engaged in running court battles with the
IRS over a decade. At brief magistrate's hearings in
Albuquerque in March, an IRS investigator from Denver, Bruce
Mason, testified that he had searched the couple's NCBA
office last September. He said he found tax-protest
literature, copies of 1099s that the IRS service center had
received, a computer holding many names, and a variety of
office machines.
   The investigator testified that he also found
videocassettes explaining "how to file 1099s against victims
they don't agree with and how to submit them to the IRS to
get their victims audited and any harassment that might
have."
   The IRS declines to say whether it has identified the
source of the videocassettes or to comment on whether they
are thought to be linked to the NCBA.
   John Voss, the NCBA director, said in a telephone
interview last week that he had been out of touch with Mr.
and Mrs. Williams since at least the middle of last year and
that he hadn't heard about the Albuquerque indictments. "That
1099 thing is a new one on me," he said. "There's nothing in
our material about that kind of thing. It sounds like a kind
of strange activity."
   Here in Farmington, the glass door of the NCBA office is
locked. On the wall just inside can be seen a big poster for
a movie called "Harry's War." The promotional pitch: "The IRS
wouldn't admit they made a mistake on Harry Johnson's taxes
and Harry had no choice but to fight back."
