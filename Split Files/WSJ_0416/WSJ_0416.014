   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., in a letter to shareholders,
attacked a proposal by New York investor Carl Icahn to spin
off the company's steel business, saying the plan may not be
tax-free.
   Shareholders are scheduled to vote May 7 on Mr. Icahn's
proposal to split the company's steel and energy businesses,
and give 80% or more of the steel business to shareholders as
a dividend.

   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry cited a study by Robert
Willens, who follows tax and accounting issues for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Mr. Willens suggests that the Internal Revenue Service may
question whether the spinoff was made for a valid business
reason, or whether it was a device to raise the stock price,
in which case it may not qualify as tax-free.
   Mr. Willens concludes that "there is doubt regarding the
transaction's qualification as a tax-free spinoff."
   Mr. Icahn couldn't be reached for comment. He previously
said, however, that his lawyers had advised him that the
spinoff could be done on a tax-free basis.
   Mr. Corry also said Mr. Icahn's proposal fails to consider
at least $115 million a year in new expenses involved in
forming two separate companies. For example, he said, the
riskier steel business would have to borrow separately and
would probably pay a higher interest rate than USX pays now.
