   Boeing Co., ending months of speculation, said three
Japanese aerospace companies would together serve as a sort
of super-subcontractor on the 767-X airplane, but their role
will fall far short of being an equity partner on the
project.
   Although the Japanese still will put up some cash for the
767-X and some of their profits will be tied to the overall
success of the plane, the tentative arrangement means that
Boeing essentially will be funding the estimated $3 billion
development program out of its own pocket.

   The setup also means that there is likely to be more work
left on the 767-X for U.S. companies, particularly defense
contractors that are looking for ways to keep their factories
pumping in the face of the declining military budget. Boeing
singled out Lockheed Corp., Grumman Corp. and Rockwell
International Corp. as finding themselves with a shrinking
number of Pentagon contracts.
   The Japanese firms, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd., have for 12 years supplied Boeing with major parts for
the 767, including fuselage panels, landing-gear doors and
drag-reducing forms called fairings. All told, those parts
are equivalent to about 15% of the value of the twin-jet's
airframe.
   On the 767-X, the companies will build the same sorts of
equipment, equal to as much as 20% of the plane's structure.
In addition, Japanese representatives will be stationed in
the 767-X program office in Seattle, which will give them an
expanded insight into how the plane is coming along.
   "It's a step up from what they're doing on the 767, but
not a big step," said Lawrence Clarkson, senior vice
president, government and international affairs, at Boeing's
commercial aircraft unit.
   Indeed, unlike true equity participants, the Japanese
won't be entitled to straight revenue-sharing on the 767-X,
which is to be designated the 777 once orders are placed,
launching what could well emerge into an entire family of
medium-range to long-range planes. They also won't be
entitled to peruse Boeing's books.
   Most important, the Japanese firms won't be privy to key
technological procedures from which they could glean how all
the subassemblies of the 767-X will be integrated to make the
complete plane. And although they will be aware of the
airlines with which Boeing is haggling over 767-X orders,
they won't attend meetings with those carriers or be allowed
to come to internal marketing sessions.
   In short, the Japanese will be observers, not
decision-makers. Many industry-watchers and news reports had
for months asserted that the Japanese role would be much
greater, though sources indicated to this newspaper several
weeks ago that the possibility of partnership on the 767-X
was growing more remote.
   The final outcome is welcome news to those who worried
that if the Japanese had been granted more to do on the
767-X, they could have used it to begin building their own
formidable aerospace industry. Aircraft-making remains one of
the few high-tech areas in which the U.S. has a leg up on its
economic competitors around the globe, and General Dynamics
Corp.'s recent co-development pact with Mitsubishi on the FSX
fighter consequently drew the ire of many Washington
lawmakers.
   Yet Mr. Clarkson dismissed such fears as largely
xenophobic and short-sighted, maintaining that technology is
inevitably "a fleeting thing." And he said those concerns
played no part in the Japanese refraining from an equity
partnership, which would have given them practically
unfettered access to all phases of the project.
   "We told them that if they wanted to be equity partners,
they would have to put up 25%," Mr. Clarkson said. "They
thought it was just more than they could handle right now"
given their commitments on the FSX, as well as on a recently
struck, open-ended joint venture agreement between Mitsubishi
and Daimler-Benz AG, West Germany's largest industrial group.
Officials at the three Japanese companies couldn't be reached
immediately.
   Mr. Clarkson said that while he believes Japan has its eye
on space and will be an important contributor of supersonic
transports one day, Japan is content for now to play second
fiddle in the commercial airliner market. "This is not like
selling cars," he said, citing the ill-fated attempt by Japan
in the 1960s to develop a 60-seat propeller plane, the YS-11.
   But Clyde Prestowitz Jr., a former senior Commerce
Department official, attacked such thinking as misguided.
"Boeing is either being arrogant, ignorant or just blowing
smoke," he said.
   "Aerospace is probably the Japanese single most important
target," Mr. Prestowitz said, noting that also last week,
Japan's Toray Industries Inc. announced that one of its
advanced carbon-reinforced plastics had been approved by
Boeing for use in the primary structure of its aircraft.
   Mr. Prestowitz, who now serves as president of the
Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank, also
scoffed at the notion that the Japanese companies or their
government sponsor, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, didn't feel comfortable coming up with a 25%
position in the 767-X. "They spill a billion dollars at
breakfast," he said, adding that the Japanese had no trouble
pledging a 25% stake in the 7J7, a potentially multibillion
dollar 1986 venture with Boeing that has been put on the back
burner.
   But Mr. Clarkson countered that the 350-seat 767-X, which
is bigger than the 767 but smaller than the 747 jumbo jet, is
of a different scale than the 150-seat propfan 7J7. In fact,
he said, one of the engine casings on the 767-X will be of
roughly the same diameter as the body of the 7J7.
