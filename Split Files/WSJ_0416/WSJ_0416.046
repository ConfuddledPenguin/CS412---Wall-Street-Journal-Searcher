   I expect more from your fine newspaper than puerile
hatchet jobs such as Joe Queenan's review of Robert Ludlum's
"The Bourne Ultimatum" (Leisure &amp; Arts, March 22). Mr.
Queenan appears to me to be upset because he cannot follow
the plot shifts and subtle nuances typical of a Ludlum novel.
I must also take from his comments that the wisdom of the
analogical tales contained in "Leadership Secrets of Attila
the Hun" completely escaped him.
   Mr. Queenan's nit-picking of Mr. Ludlum's work (too many
exclamation points]]]]]]]) reminds me of nothing so much as
the scene in the movie "Amadeus" where Mozart's music is
criticized by an envious fellow composer for containing "too
many notes."

   And regarding Mr. Queenan's use of his "fine-tooth comb"
to eliminate potentially flattering prose from his work, my
guess is that he can look forward to reading banners culled
from his article that proclaim Mr. Ludlum's work "a victory"
(third paragraph), "loaded" (fifth paragraph), and "sizzling"
(fifth paragraph). Say it ain't so, Joe.

   I hate to be the one to break it to Mr. Queenan, but his
comb is missing a few teeth. Despite his scathing (and
thoroughly enjoyable) review, he has once again unwittingly
provided a publisher with the perfect book-jacket gem:
"Sizzling novel of international intrigue."

   Recently, a friend threatened to publish an alleged book
review by that world-renowned writer, Joe Queenan of
Tarrytown, N.Y. Unfortunately, my friend made good on his
threat and I can recall many parts of this inane, oafish and
idiotic agglomeration of words in the guise of a legitimate
book review. While the threat was serious, and I left town to
avoid it, my reading of The Wall Street Journal left me fully
exposed to Mr. Queenan's quarrelsome quill.
   Alas, as an inveterate Ludlum reader, I plunged through
Mr. Queenan's thoroughly awful review. For many years, I, and
many others, have enjoyed perusing Mr. Ludlum's latest in the
manner of its writing: with tongue firmly placed in cheek.
Although friends had told me that there were those alive who
couldn't enjoy Mr. Ludlum's high parody of suspense novels, I
did not believe these mythical characters actually existed.
Suddenly and without warning, the Journal allots space to Mr.
Queenan.
   There is a true tragedy in this story. You have wasted Mr.
Queenan's priceless time, the time of those of us who
expected an honest review of "The Bourne Ultimatum," and
valuable space in one of my favorite publications. In the
future, please assign Mr. Queenan to grave subjects that do
not require him to unearth his sense of humor.

   Here's what will be on the back cover of all future
printings of "The Bourne Conundrum": "Another enchanting
moment" . . . The Wall Street Journal.
   Just wait]]] You . . . have helped them . . . again]]]
   Congratulations on a devastatingly accurate review of Mr.
Ludlum's writing.
