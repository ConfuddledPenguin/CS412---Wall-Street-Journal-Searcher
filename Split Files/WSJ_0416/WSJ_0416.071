   HANOI, Vietnam -- "The Operator."
   That is how Bob Kerrey once saw himself. He was a Navy
SEAL then, trained to kill with a blow or a bullet. Friends
say he had "a SEAL personality" -- can-do, supremely
self-assured, even cocky. He had the cool ability to distance
himself from the killing and the suffering.

   But that was 21 years ago, before an enemy grenade came
flying out of the predawn darkness during a commando raid.
Before his lower right leg was torn apart. Before Vietnam,
the defining event of his life.
   Last week, the Operator came back -- now a 46-year-old
United States senator from Nebraska on a fact-finding tour
for the Foreign Relations Committee. Now being weighed by
Democrats in Washington as a potential presidential
candidate, he is in some ways still cocky, still can-do.
   But in a fundamental way, the man who returned was not the
man who had left. Mr. Kerrey is now acutely sensitized to
pain. He would witness an abundance of it on his Southeast
Asia trip. He saw and felt such things, he said, "that if I
had stopped to look very long I might not have been able to
go back to the United States. I would just become too
engaged."
   Sen. Kerrey delivered that summation as he stood in the
gray mist of an early Hanoi morning. Soon, he would attend
Easter Sunday Mass and be besieged outside the church by
clutching beggars -- children, mostly, and women with
infants. Then he would fly out of this country, his military
plane lifting above the bomb craters that still pockmark the
brilliant green fields.
   Just now, though, he was watching a stiff-legged
Vietnamese war veteran play badminton. The veteran had been
shot through the knee, but in compensation his opponent
allowed him to use a racket in each hand. The whole trip was
like that moment -- full of present pain and reminders of
past pain.
   In Cambodia, the senator visited a hospital filled with
children on intravenous tubes. In his presence, a girl of
about seven abruptly vomited up black fluid, twitched and
died. In Thailand, he helicoptered through the heat and the
haze toward mountains that reared up like those of ancient
Chinese scroll paintings. A mile away from Cambodia and its
smoldering civil war, he walked stoically and wordlessly
through an outdoor hospital ward filled with amputees.
   In Thailand, he became the highest-ranking U.S. visitor to
a refugee camp controlled by the Khmer Rouge. Touring the
camp, the senator, whose lower leg has been replaced by a
prosthesis, passed by one-legged men who had no prosthesis.
He heard tales of leprosy, tuberculosis and sporadic
artillery shelling of the camp from across the border.
   Then, inside a sweltering shelter, he had a tense, terse
exchange with three cold-eyed Khmer Rouge officials --
political descendants of those Communists who snuffed out at
least one million of their fellow countrymen in the Cambodian
Killing Fields of 1975 to 1978.
   "No one {in the U.S.} mourns the driving of the Khmer
Rouge out of Cambodia," he told the men across the table.
(The Vietnamese pushed them to the Cambodian-Thailand border
after invading in 1978.) Cold-eyed himself, he probed for
some hint of remorse for the genocide.
   "We were so young," volunteered one Khmer Rouge official.
   It wasn't enough. The senator stiffly said goodbye and
returned to his helicopter. "I think they would go back into
the Fields in about five minutes, those guys," he burst out.
   For Mr. Kerrey, this trip was as much a journey of the
self as it was a fact-finding mission -- a chance to further
integrate, and apply, his Vietnam experience.
   Despite the intensifying interest he is generating in
Washington, he went out of his way to discourage publicity on
this trip. He turned down the television networks, the news
magazines, several newspapers. In the end, he took only
correspondents from The Wall Street Journal and the Omaha
World-Herald. And at times we seemed to discomfit him.
   While visiting the amputee ward, he was approached by Gary
Parrott, an ex-SEAL and close friend who had joined the
traveling group. Mr. Parrott, looking for some way to offer
hope to a Cambodian amputee, suggested: "You ought to show
him what you've got." (The senator's prosthesis enables him
to run and walk with scarcely a trace of a limp.)
   "Yeah, if I can get alone," muttered Mr. Kerrey. But the
chance never came.
   The journey, however, did offer this intuitive, outspoken
senator a chance to test tentative foreign policy
assumptions. His central thesis is that even as U.S.-Soviet
tensions ease dramatically, both countries, along with China,
continue to treat Vietnam and Cambodia as Cold War pawns. The
pawns themselves not only tolerate but encourage this
behavior. The only losers, he believes, are the people.
   "Sometimes, you've got to get beyond the ideology and
focus on humanitarianism," he said.
   In Cambodia, he startled his hosts, who tried to bottle
him up in a Phnom Penh government guest house, by borrowing a
bicycle from a maintenance man and pedaling down to the
market. He disconcerted his Hanoi hosts by insisting on
attending Mass, even though he belongs to a Presbyterian
church back home. By wandering around and asking questions,
he discovered that Vietnam's cardinal is under virtual house
arrest.
   In one remarkably frank exchange with Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach, he chided Vietnam for winning its war of
independence only to suppress the independence of its own
citizens. "Some of us believed we were fighting for the
freedom of the Vietnamese people," he said in one of his few
allusions to his own war activities. Mr. Thach, witty and
urbane, parried.
   "I like to let the dreamers dream," Mr. Kerrey said. "Only
at night," admonished Mr. Thach. "Day and night," insisted
Mr. Kerrey.
   While his wartime experiences were seldom mentioned, they
never seemed far from the senator's mind. He entered
Southeast Asia last week by commercial jet, a decided
contrast to his entry in January 1969. Then it was by a
converted cargo plane. He remembers disembarking in the warm
darkness, then nervously holding his weapon at the ready as
he and other new arrivals were driven up the coast. By
daylight, though, he concluded that nervousness had been
unwarranted: "We could see guys surfing along the beach."
   Less than three months later, he led a pre-dawn assault
against an enemy unit on the island of Hon Tre. He and his
men scaled a cliff. They began to advance. Then things went
terribly wrong.
   A firefight erupted. The grenade came out of nowhere. Bob
Kerrey never saw the man who got him. The rest of his small
unit was evacuated with relatively minor wounds; Mr. Kerrey,
who remained behind until all his men had been rescued, would
eventually receive the Congressional Medal of Honor from
President Nixon.
   But first there would be the below-the-knee amputation,
the long journey of pain, a protracted lesson in humility. It
began in a Naval hospital in Japan. Angry at his fate, angry
at the medical personnel, he was not a model patient. "I've
got to get out of here," he lashed out. The next thing he
knew, he recalls, a burly male nurse appeared at his bedside,
ripped him out of bed, carried him through the hospital ward
-- and dumped him on the grass outside. It was a brutal, but
effective, warning against self-pity.
   His electoral career has represented the political
coming-of-age of the Vietnam generation. Some Democratic
professionals see his almost unique credentials --
particularly his war-hero record, which would neutralize any
Republican charges that Democrats are soft on national
security -- as potential salvation. As governor of Nebraska,
divorced and the father of two, he had a much-publicized
relationship with actress Debra Winger; it only seems to have
added to his political appeal.
   He's already taken criticism for being too impulsive, too
erratic. "Cosmic Bob," Newsweek magazine called him recently.
A "non-linear personality" -- that's how staffers described
him when he was governor. He has a healthy ego. Yet he can
talk of the wish to live more like Mother Teresa. "She
needn't fear losing anything," he says wistfully, "because
she's given it all away." This trip seemed, in some ways, an
attempt to meld those sentiments with his ambitions.
   In Hanoi, he found a city of gracious boulevards but faded
elegance, a primitive city where bicycles throng the streets
and calloused hands work the fields on the outskirts. Sen.
Kerrey's schedule also included a visit to that secular
shrine of Vietnam, the mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh. The body is
spotlighted, and an honor guard stands at attention in the
semi-darkness. Then the senator was off in a horn-honking,
bicycle-dodging motorcade for meetings with government
officials.
   He found those officials eager for outside capital,
especially now that the Soviet Union seems to be trimming its
aid, and anxious for the U.S. to relax economic pressures.
   His hosts took him to a war monument near the site where
Naval pilot and now Sen. John McCain was captured after his
plane went down. Mr. McCain was to endure five and a half
years of captivity and torture. The monument shows a U.S.
airman on his knees, head bowed and hands upraised in
surrender.
   "His name is spelled wrong," Sen. Kerrey informed Foreign
Minister Thach. "The wrong name in the right place," replied
Mr. Thach. "I think," Sen. Kerrey replied dryly, "he would
agree."
   One of his main goals was to deliver a warning to
officials: He repeatedly argued that the Cambodian government
installed after Vietnam's invasion is vulnerable to charges
that it is nothing more than a puppet. That, he said, gives
the Khmer Rouge a potent rallying point. In the end, Sen.
Kerrey said he felt somewhat more encouraged about the
possibility of an agreement on Cambodia.
   Much of Mr. Kerrey's message was reconciliation. "Part of
what America must do in coming to terms with Vietnam is to
come to terms with the Vietnamese people," he said. In a
meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Do Muoi, he likened
the U.S. and Vietnam to "a couple that has gone through a
bitter divorce. They have divided the property. They have
fought over the children. They now live in separate houses.
Both must say, `We made mistakes.'"
