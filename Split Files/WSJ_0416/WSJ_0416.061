   NEW YORK -- There's more opportunity this week to blame
Mother Nature for some recent off-key forecasts on the
economy's pace of growth and inflation.
   Economists, who have been revising first-quarter forecasts
right and left as March data materializes, say consumer
prices should be tamer, industrial production and capacity
utilization should hold firm, housing starts should slip back
to normally depressed levels, and the February trade deficit
should improve substantially. Most of the week's data are due
out tomorrow and much of the month-to-month changes are
pegged to anomalies of weather.

   "We're one of the largest industrialized countries, yet a
little warm weather here or there seems to affect us as much
as a small agricultural economy," said Samuel D. Kahan,
economist at Fuji Securities Inc., Chicago. It all adds up to
some unforeseen strength in first-quarter numbers, he said.
"But is it real?"
   In recent weeks, several economists have raised their
first-quarter forecasts, citing weather and other special
factors. "The first quarter turned out to be stronger than we
thought," said David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/
McGraw Hill, Lexington, Mass. He now estimates real gross
national product grew at about a 2% rate in the first
quarter. DRI "borrowed" most of the higher growth estimate
from the second quarter. "We now think the two quarters will
be more or less the same size, rather than a weak first
quarter and a strong second quarter," he said.
   Extremely cold weather in December sent fuel and food
costs soaring in a wave that hasn't yet fully retraced
itself. And, January's unusually mild weather boosted
employment, throwing many jobs and output forecasts out of
whack.
   March consumer prices are expected to rise only a modest
0.2% or so, though some economists say the number may
actually slide into the negative. Friday's
better-than-expected report on March producer prices showed
the first drop in wholesale prices in seven months. Much of
the improvement in both indexes is believed to be a rebound
from sharply higher fuel and food costs because of frigid
weather early in the year.
   The March consumer price index is also expected to benefit
from a fallback in clothing prices. In February, the CPI rose
0.5%, partly because of a 3.3% jump in apparel costs. The
latest reading is also expected to benefit from lower
gasoline prices that weren't fully passed through in the
February index.
   A drop in oil imports -- another weather-related factor --
is expected to help the February trade imbalance. The deficit
is believed to have narrowed to about $8 billion from
January's $9.3 billion, according to a survey by MMS
International Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill, New York.
   March housing starts, on the other hand, are expected to
fall back to an annual rate of about 1.4 million units after
a step-up in building to take advantage of the earlier mild
weather.
   Industrial production is expected to expand a bit, despite
lingering declines in manufacturing employment, said Morgan
Stanley Co. economist Stephen S. Roach. Much of the firmness
stems from a weather-related rebound in utility production,
Mr. Roach said in his weekly commentary. He expects a 0.3%
increase in output, a bit stronger than the consensus view,
which calls for a 0.1% upgrade. Output rose 0.6% in February.
   Benchmark revisions in March industrial production and its
offshoot capacity utilization reset the base year to 1987
from 1977 and adjust the industry mix to reflect the more
recent data. Not surprisingly, the biggest change in the
business mix came in the computer sector, according to a
recent article in the latest Federal Reserve Bulletin. It
said the revised annual growth rate of business equipment was
"quite a bit stronger" than previously shown because of
sharply faster growth of office and computing machines. The
changes bring the Fed's data closer in line with the Commerce
Department's revised reading on computer growth.
