   PARIS (AP) -- A drug company halted production at its
factory and ordered its products removed from drugstore
shelves after tests indicated contamination of some of its
medicine with sulfuric acid.
   Smith Kline &amp; French, a subsidiary of the
British-U.S.company SmithKline Beecham PLC, said it was
suspending all exports of Zentel, an anti-parasite medicine
sold in many African, Asian and South American countries
under the name Albendazole.

   The company said traces of sulfuric acid were found in a
bottle of Zentel after threats by an unknown person demanding
$1 million. The firm said efforts would be made to recall
Zentel shipped overseas since the first threat was made in
early April.
   Zentel is produced only for export, but the company
announced a temporary halt to production of all medicine at
its factory in Limay, outside Paris. The concern also imposed
a quarantine on sales of all products made at the factory
since March 15.
   The firm said police were investigating.
   The company didn't provide further details of the
contamination.
