   Riding a wave of growth in computer networks, Cabletron
Systems Inc. will report sharply higher sales and net income
for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28, said Robert Levine,
president and chief executive officer.
   Cabletron, based in Rochester, N.H., will report profit of
about $6 million, or 23 cents a share, on an increase in
revenue to about $30 million, Mr. Levine said. Year-earlier
net was $3.9 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of
$18.6 million.

   For the year, net is believed to have nearly doubled, to
$22 million, or 87 cents a share, from $11.9 million, or 48
cents a share, in fiscal 1989. Revenue is put at about $104
million, up from $54.8 million.
   Cabletron develops, manufactures and installs cabling,
network-management software and data concentrators to connect
personal computers and workstations. The market has been
growing rapidly and is forecast to reach more than $750
million within three years, according to consultant Forrester
Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass.
   Cabletron, which went public last year at $15.50 a share,
saw its stock fall as low as $7 before mounting a strong
comeback in recent months. Analysts questioned the company's
relatively young, unseasoned management team and Cabletron's
ability to keep pace with changing technology.
   In an interview, Mr. Levine, 32 years old, said he and
co-founder and Chairman Craig Benson, 36, are working to
recruit managers and had increased the engineering and
software development staff sharply. "We know our limitations,
and we are going to have to add some professional managers as
the company continues to grow," he said.
   Mr. Levine, who directed the transformation of Cabletron
from a low-tech cable installer to a network-equipment maker,
added that the company hasn't marketed itself very well. He
plans to step up spending on marketing this year and hopes to
expand European operations, which now account for about 20%
of total sales.
   Cabletron has steadily increased its investments in
product development and recently unveiled a line of
fiber-optic plug-in boards for Apple and IBM-compatible
personal computer networks. Mr. Levine said Case Western
Reserve University has already installed a large, fiber-optic
computer network using the devices, which range in price from
$399 to $949 a card.
   Cabletron's largest customer is Sun Microsystems Inc., the
big Mountain View, Calif., workstation maker. Sun accounted
for about 4% of Cabletron's revenue in fiscal 1989, Mr.
Levine said. Other customers and resellers include American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Silicon Graphics and Unisys, he added.
   Mary A. Modahl of Forrester Research said Cabletron is in
a three-way tie for market share with SynOptics and Tandem
Computers' Ungermann-Bass unit. She says SynOptics, with 1989
revenue of $77.3 million, probably has somewhat more market
momentum than Cabletron.
   "Cabletron is in a very hot market, but few people on Wall
Street have ever heard of them," she said. "They've combined
a no-nonsense cable-pulling business with some impressive
technology."
