   TOKYO -- An advanced carbon-reinforced plastic made by
Toray Industries Inc. has been approved by Boeing Co. for use
in the primary structure of its aircraft, the Japanese
company said.
   A spokesman for the company, which is the leader of
Japan's synthetic-fiber industry, said Boeing approved the
fiber April 5 after testing.

   The spokesman denied a news report it has received orders
from Boeing for the material. He said it was likely Boeing
would consider using the fiber in the 777 jumbo jet it
currently is developing.
   Toray expects the fiber, called TORAYCA prepreg P2302, to
be used in the fuselage, tail and main wings of new aircraft.
The company estimates that the weight of aircraft could be
reduced as much as 25% by use of carbon-reinforced plastics.
Boeing, Europe's Airbus Industrie and other manufacturers
currently use a Toray carbon fiber in the secondary
structural elements of aircraft.
   Toray's P2302 combines carbon fiber with epoxy resins. One
metric ton of the material costs around 20,000 yen ($126),
the spokesman said.
