   MONTREAL -- Imasco Ltd. said its Hardee's subsidiary, the
No. 3 hamburger chain in the U.S., plans to keep the Roy
Rogers brand alive by adding the newly acquired chain's fried
fresh chicken product and name to Hardee's menu.
   The move to add "bone-in" chicken to its product roster
marks a first by a major burger chain. But it reflects the
fast-food industry's relentless drive to find new products
that can boost sales in a slowing market.

   Putting the Roy Rogers brand name on the Hardee's menu
while otherwise erasing Roy Rogers as a restaurant banner
would also be an innovation. But, notes an industry
consultant, millions of dollars were spent creating the Roy
Rogers brand. "Why would you want to walk away from that?"
asks Robert Ross, an associate at Technomic Inc. of Chicago.
   Executives at Hardee's Montreal parent are enthusiastic,
but they caution that Hardee's still must run market tests
and solve difficult operational problems.
   "There's a lot of excitement," says Purdy Crawford,
chairman, president and chief executive of Imasco, in part
because it's "something we didn't put a lot of value on in
terms of evaluating the acquisition."
   Hardee's agreed in January to acquire the 600-restaurant
Roy Rogers chain from Marriott Corp. for about $365 million.
   "We have a strong breakfast and tend to be weak in
late-day and early evening," Mr. Crawford said. "This is why
the Roy Rogers products are so important for us."
   "Bone-in" chicken -- fresh chicken pieces fried intact --
is considered a distinct product segment in the fast-food
industry and is the lead product of such chains as Kentucky
Fried Chicken. The big burger chains, including Hardee's, so
far limit their chicken menus to assorted boneless filet,
patty and nugget products.
   Hardee's is currently testing the fried chicken at an
outlet in Rocky Mount, N.C., where Hardee's is based. The
test is to determine the equipment and operational changes
required. Then "we're going to test market it pretty quick,"
Mr. Crawford said.
   Imasco executives and Hardee's franchisees are also doing
their own impromptu taste tests. "I personally visited twice
last week along with our R&amp;D people," said Steve McManus,
senior vice-president operations at Spartan Food Systems, a
subsidiary of TW Services Inc. Spartan is Hardee's largest
franchisee with 467 outlets.
   "We think it's an excellent product," Mr. McManus said.
However, frying fresh chicken could be expensive because of
the new equipment required, he said. Spread over the entire
chain the investment in new equipment could be substantial.
Hardee's has 3,300 outlets.
   But Spartan is "anxious to see" the results of intensive
market tests. "Everyone in our industry is looking for a
boost at dinner." Mr. McManus said. "This could be something
big, if it works."
   Hardee's also expects to gain early-morning sales at the
Roy Rogers outlets as it converts them to the Hardee's banner
and menu. Breakfasts account for about 25% of sales at
Hardee's and only 5% at Roy Rogers, said Raymond Guyatt,
Imasco chief financial officer.
   Hardee's outlets are concentrated in the South and
Midwest. Roy Rogers is strong in the Northeast, especially in
New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and Baltimore. Hardee's
will convert Roy Rogers market by market, beginning with
Baltimore.
   There is a chance a few Roy Rogers outlets will continue
to operate under that banner. Imasco has promised Roy Rogers
franchisees they can keep the name if they absolutely insist.
Of 600 Roy Rogers, 237 are franchised.
