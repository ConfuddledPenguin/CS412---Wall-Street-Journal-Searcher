   Orange-co Inc. said it plans to sell about 5,600 acres of
citrus property and several other assets to focus on
improving the profitability of its remaining citrus holdings.
   Lake Hamilton, Fla., Orange-co, one of the nation's
largest citrus producers, said the moves would leave it with
about 17,900 citrus acres, which have an estimated value of
$100 million. The company said all, or most, of the expected
gain from the asset sales would be sheltered by its existing
net operating loss carry-forward, which stands in excess of
$40 million.

   The company said that when it has successfully completed
restructuring its assets, it will be essentially debt-free,
with an improved cash flow and cash position.
   Orange-co, which is 52%-owned by Stoneridge Resources Inc.
in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., also released its fiscal
second-quarter earnings for the period ended Feb. 28. The
company posted a net loss of $5.2 million, or 51 cents a
share, compared with net income of $994,000, or 10 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $30.3 million, from
$36.2 million.
   Orange-co said the loss stemmed from charges related to
the freeze that struck Florida in late December in addition
to losses associated with the sale of non-citrus-related
investments.
