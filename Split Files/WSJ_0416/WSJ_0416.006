   HONG KONG -- Wall Street's retrenchment has caused two big
U.S. securities firms to scale down some investment banking
activities in the Asia-Pacific region, even though markets
there remain healthy.
   But at the same time that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. have been affected, other U.S. firms and
their European and Asian counterparts are expanding or
setting up operations in the region. These firms are likely
to fill any gaps left by the bigger U.S. firms' retrenchment,
which means the overall investment banking market won't be
greatly affected by Wall Street's cost-cutting.

   U.S. firms' operations in Japan and their securities
businesses throughout the region -- except for the operations
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which is liquidating --
appear to be safe from retrenchment. But for many U.S.
securities companies with Asia-Pacific investment banking
operations, the question is whether their home offices will
commit the resources needed to grow with the region, or cede
the smaller Asian-Pacific markets to Asian and European
rivals to concentrate on the U.S. market and the new allure
of Europe.
   Even the U.S. units that are committed to expanding in the
region are finding it harder to get a hearing from their home
offices, as cost-conscious parent companies struggle with
smaller budgets.
   The head of a U.S. firm's investment banking operation in
Hong Kong, who is worried about his hopes for the firm's
growth, said: "This is the fastest-growth market in the
world, but will they be able to devote the resources to this
market to make it out here? The jury is out."
   Merrill Lynch and Shearson, the two largest U.S.
securities firms, have reduced staffing and growth plans in
their Asia-Pacific investment banking operations. The two
firms have been hit hard by the steep recession on Wall
Street, which has led to the dismissals of nearly 45,000
securities employees in the U.S. since the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   In 1989, Merrill Lynch had its first unprofitable year as
a public company, after taking a $470 million restructuring
charge. Shearson, which recently required a $750 million cash
infusion from its parent, American Express Co., has said it
expects a first-quarter loss of as much as $917 million after
taking $787 million in charges for bad loans, a retrenchment
plan and other items. The firm said in February that it
planned to cut 17% of its investment banking staff
world-wide.
   Merrill Lynch's Hong Kong investment banking arm has
experienced firings and departures. Shearson has closed its
Sydney, Australia, office. The parent companies haven't
completed a review of business areas, and more cuts could
come.
   Executives of both companies who are based in the region
remain hopeful that retrenchment won't render them incapable
of exploiting the region's opportunities. "Despite the many
ups and downs on Wall Street, we have to position ourselves
for the growth in Asia," said K.C. Kwan, Asia regional
director for Merrill Lynch.
   Troubles on Wall Street, however, may make it difficult
for the Merrill Lynch and Shearson units to keep up with
rivals in the Asia-Pacific region, where some investment
banking operations, such as the relative newcomers from
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and the Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of
Salomon Inc., expanded rapidly in the past few years and
appear willing to continue spending the money to build
business. This view is shared by European firms, such as
Baring Brothers &amp; Co., and by Asia-based Jardine Fleming &amp;
Co. and James Capel (Far East) Ltd., which is owned by
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
   By contrast, the staff at Merrill Lynch's Hong Kong
investment banking arm has shrunk to 10 from 18. Mr. Kwan
said the loss is minor, but acknowledged that the posts won't
be filled soon. Moreover, fearful of a long, slow decline, a
few senior Merrill Lynch and Shearson employees are beginning
to look for other jobs.
   Four top directors of Merrill Lynch's investment banking
unit, all Asia veterans, left early this year after the
retrenchment began. Other investment banking executives in
Hong Kong regard the problems at Merrill Lynch's Hong Kong
unit as serious. In the past five years, Merrill Lynch has
been a leader in Asia, topping the 1989 list of investment
banking operations for the value of mergers-and-acquisitions
business and for Eurobonds.
   One newly appointed Merrill Lynch executive in Hong Kong
conceded that when he interviews people, he tells them there
is "a risk factor in coming to work for Merrill." He said he
expects some additional departures in Tokyo and the rest of
Asia, and predicts a long period to rebuild the business.
   As for Shearson, its decision to close its Sydney
operation reflected in part the frustration of many banks and
securities companies that have tried to crack that market and
the extent to which the Australian economy has deteriorated.
But the problems in New York forced Shearson to cut its
losses in Australia instead of investing more money; company
officials had believed the operation could become profitable
in two years.
   Shearson officials hope there won't be any more cuts in
the region, but they acknowledged that the firm will grow at
a far slower rate than they had wanted.
   Executives from other foreign investment banking units try
to distance themselves from the problems Merrill Lynch and
Shearson face.
   "What is happening at Merrill and Shearson is unique to
their own corporate history, and I don't see any linkage
between their corporate strategy and ours," an official at
Morgan Stanley said.
   Nevertheless, many investment bankers in the region have
trouble convincing their U.S. bosses that Asia encompasses
more markets than Japan and selling the home office on an
expansion strategy.
   "There is so much competition for resources, and we are
far away from the ears you have to whisper into," a U.S.
investment banking executive said.
   The one advantage is that few of these operations grew too
rapidly in the Asia-Pacific region or adopted the strategy of
being all things to all people -- a tack that is partly
blamed for the retrenchment the U.S. industry faces.
   Most companies expanded into specific niche markets in the
region, and then had to justify that growth. It has become
even more difficult in recent years, as costs rocketed and
profit margins narrowed in the region, and Europe grew
increasingly attractive. The opening of Eastern Europe and
the unified European market that is to start in 1992 have
drawn the attention of some U.S. firms.
   Asia-Pacific investment banking offices for many U.S. and
European firms grew, even as thousands lost their jobs in the
U.S. and London after the 1987 crash. Managers in Asian
offices kept their heads down and quietly added people.
   Any gaps left by a slowdown in the development of some
U.S. companies will be quickly filled by other companies.
   Baring has been expanding aggressively. In 1989, 25% of
the company's staff was in the Asia-Pacific region, compared
with only 6% in the U.S., and a managing director said the
company "remains a believer" in the strength of the region.
   Morgan Stanley said its strategy for growth in the region,
set in the 1980s, hasn't changed. Salomon and Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co. are substantial players in Japan, but also are planning
to expand in other countries in the region.
   Some of the best-positioned investment banking operations
are those based regionally that don't have to report to New
York or London.
   A group of executives from Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers
Hong Kong Ltd., the London-based securities arm of the U.S.
banking concern Citicorp, left to start Peregrine Capital
Ltd. 1 1/2 years ago. They wanted to tap the potential of the
Asian-Pacific markets without being distracted by the
problems in other international markets or the demands of
association with a bank.
   "Our main lines of business will only be strengthened in
Southeast Asia," Peter Wong, Peregrine's financial director,
said. "We still think it's the biggest growth area."
