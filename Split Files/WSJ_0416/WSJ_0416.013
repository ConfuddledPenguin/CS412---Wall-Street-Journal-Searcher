   Today Is It

<TEXT>
   Some always look to the future,
   Obsessed with the "if and when";
   Others elect to dwell in the past --
   The nostalgic "there and then."
   There are also those more fortunate ones
   Who have learned the secret how
   To make the most of the present --
   The fleeting "here and now."
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   There's one thing on envelopes
   I've been seeing of late:
   If it is stamped "Urgent]"
   Then I know it can wait.
