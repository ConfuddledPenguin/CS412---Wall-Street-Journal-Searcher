   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia -- Farmers here call it the same
word they use for medicine. The government taught them for 20
years that the more obat, or pesticides, they sprayed, the
healthier their rice crops would be. It was inexpensive too:
The government sold a dollar's worth for only 15 cents.
   It seemed to work. With new hybrid seeds, irrigation
water, and plenty of fertilizer and obat, rice yields soared.
In 1976, Indonesia was the world's biggest rice importer. By
1983, it was growing enough rice to feed itself.

   Then on Nov. 5, 1986, President Suharto issued a startling
decree: no more obat. Chemical sprays, he said, were doing
more harm than good. Specifically, they were helping
populations of one rice pest, the brown planthopper, to
explode. Therefore, he said, he was banning 57 highly toxic
insecticides from use on rice.
   Indonesia, he declared would henceforth use the
"alternative agriculture" techniques of integrated pest
management, or IPM, to control rice pests: essentially,
letting good bugs control bad bugs, with milder pesticides
held for emergencies.
   The Suharto decree is only beginning to be felt, but 3 1/2
years later the president remains deeply committed to cutting
back on agricultural chemicals, according to four of his
cabinet ministers.
   IPM experiments have been set up in other countries, but
Indonesia's is the most closely watched because of its size
and scope. As IPM promoters point out, conversion to
pesticide-free agriculture has occurred among a limited
number of specialized "organic" farmers in the U.S., but this
isn't that. This is the president of the world's fifth
most-populous nation and third largest rice-producing nation
(after China and India) reversing a tenet on growing the food
on which its economy and stability depend.
   (Last September the National Academy of Sciences
recommended similar steps toward "alternative agriculture"
for U.S. farmers. U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed,
saying that emphasis on "natural" farming methods and
de-emphasis on chemicals would gradually become the norm if
farmers are to reduce the high costs, erosion and pollution
problems associated with agricultural chemicals.)
   "Our farmers . . . have been encouraged to use pesticides
to protect their crops," says Johannes B. Sumarlin, who as
Indonesia's planning minister helped sell IPM to Suharto.
"Now we are telling them they cannot do this, that they are
to rely primarily on the natural enemies of rice destroying
pests to control them.
   "The broad use of pesticides, part of the agricultural
program in Indonesia and other rice-growing nations for some
20 years, does more harm than good because it does more to
eliminate the natural enemies of pests than the pests
themselves."
   Since the Suharto decree, say senior ministers, overall
pesticide use has dropped, rice yields haven't suffered and
major insect infestations haven't occurred. Test plots show
that farmers can increase yields without routine spraying. A
nationwide training program is under way to train IPM
teachers, pest monitors and extension agents. The goal is to
train 2.5 million of Indonesia's 10 million land-owning rice
farmers by the end of 1994.
   To break farmers of the habit of routine spraying, the
government reduced pesticide subsidies in stages, eliminating
them completely in January 1989. This saved the government
$100 million a year in subsidies and also caused retail
pesticide prices to rise, making farmers consider the cost of
a habit that was once almost free.
   Suharto banned the 57 most toxic of 66 insecticides in
common use in Indonesia, all of them broad-spectrum
organophosphates. Their makers had about half of the $170
million Indonesian market in crop pesticides. Although these
compounds can still be sold for use on vegetables and
plantation crops, production has plummeted. The country's
biggest producer, P.T. Bayer Indonesia, a unit of West
Germany's Bayer AG, dropped to 6,490 tons in 1987 from 11,697
tons in 1986. Other big producers reported production
declines averaging 50%. Cans and bottles of these pesticides
must be labeled, "Banned for use on rice," though shopkeepers
interviewed in several villages in Central Java said many
farmers ignore the label.
   Pesticide makers criticized the ban on organophosphates,
saying farmers needed them to fight other harmful rice pests
such as stemborers and leaffolders. But they generally
applauded the new "deregulated" market. By eliminating
subsidies, the government largely took itself out of
pesticide distribution, causing manufacturers to set up
marketing and promotion systems down into the villages.
   The nine pesticides still allowed for use on rice fields
are narrow-spectrum carbamates that generally kill specific
insects, and one Japanese chemical that inhibits the molting
process in planthopper larvae but doesn't kill planthopper
predators. Tokyo gave Indonesia $16 million to buy a year's
supply from the Japanese company that makes it.
   What compelled Suharto's 1986 reversal was a tiny
rice-destroying insect called the brown planthopper, the most
serious insect pest in rice. It sucks the sap of the rice
plant, weakening it, and spreads plant viruses. Planthopper
epidemics struck in the late 1970s in India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, the Solomon Islands,
Thailand and Vietnam.
   The insect spread rapidly because modern rice varieties
are planted close together and, when fertilized and
irrigated, grow lots more leaves and stalks than traditional
varieties. Irrigation gives the ability to grow rice all year
round, so there's no fallow dry season to break the
planthopper's lifecycle.
   Also, insecticide spraying killed the hopper's natural
predators and parasites. Roughly 120 species of insects and
spiders eat planthoppers or otherwise kill them. By 1986, a
planthopper outbreak threatened to make a mockery of the
Suharto regime's proudest achievement: rice self-sufficiency.
More and more pesticides did less and less good, and a
general election was coming up.
   Indonesian and foreign scientists convinced senior
ministers who, in turn, convinced Suharto that spraying was
actually worsening the outbreaks by killing the leafhoppers'
natural enemies but not leafhopper eggs. The eggs hatched,
unhindered by natural enemies. Populations exploded.
   U.S. entomologist Peter Kenmore, the United Nations Food
and Agricultural Organization's chief IPM promoter, praises
the "political will" of Indonesia's leaders, saying they are
giving the country "the most modern, flexible, and
scientifically sound field pest management system of any
country in the Third World."
   Mr. Kenmore said that the contribution of pesticides to
the enormous growth in rice yields had been overrated. He
attributes 50% of yield increases to irrigation, which allows
steady water levels year round. An additional 20% to 30% of
increased yields is due to fertilizer, he says, while the new
hybrid seeds probably account for 10%.
