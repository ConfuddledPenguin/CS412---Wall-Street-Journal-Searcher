   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. said its Executive
Life Insurance Co. subsidiary acquired several real estate
projects from FPA Corp., a Huntingdon Valley, Pa., real
estate developer, in exchange for FPA debt totaling $39.7
million.
   Executive Life said it plans to sell the properties. The
FPA debt includes $21.3 million principal amount of 12 5/8%
senior notes due 1993 and $18.5 million principal amount of
14 1/2% subordinated debentures due 2000.

   The properties include 45 single-family lots and two model
homes in Boca Raton, Fla., 47 acres of undeveloped property
within the Boca Golf &amp; Tennis Club and 600 acres of
undeveloped land at Palm-Aire Country Club, Sarasota, Fla.
Executive Life also acquired three condominium apartment
sites in Pompano, Fla., a newly issued $4 million seven-year
subordinated note bearing interest at the prime rate, and a
three-year option to acquire 400,000 shares of FPA at $4 a
share under certain circumstances.
   Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the two FPA debt issues hadn't been written
down and weren't in default.
   Worries have widened about First Executive and Executive
Life because of their large junk-bond holdings. First
Executive units held $8.05 billion of junk bonds, of which
$244.9 million was in or near default as of December,
according to documents filed with state insurance
commissions.
