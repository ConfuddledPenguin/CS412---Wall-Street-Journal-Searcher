   WASHINGTON -- Food and energy prices continue to fall back
after their steep climbs of early this year, bringing
inflation back into a moderate range, new government price
statistics indicate.
   Producer prices dropped 0.2% in March, after showing no
change in February and soaring 1.8% in January, the Labor
Department reported Friday. After two months of sharp
increases, food prices slipped 0.6% last month. Energy prices
slid 2.4%, following a 5% plunge in February.

   In late December, a bitter cold wave chilled much of the
nation, wiping out crops, sopping up energy supplies and
consequently sending food and energy prices soaring. The
latest price statistics "show that the unusual rise of prices
in January was, as we predicted, an aberration," said Richard
Rahn, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce here.
   For the most part, analysts were relieved by the new price
figures. Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National
Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, whose members buy
goods from producers, said the report "gives us another
strong signal that inflationary pressures remain in check in
the economy."
   Excluding food and energy prices --  an approach many
economists believe better indicates price pressures in the
economy because those categories are highly volatile -- the
department's producer price index for finished goods rose a
moderate 0.3% in March.
   For the past year, overall producer price inflation has
been running at 4.4%, the department said.
   But some economists warned against becoming too complacent
about inflation. "I know there are a lot of forecasters out
there who think inflation isn't a problem, and when they see
these numbers they'll say they show it isn't a problem. But
we think it is," said Michael Penzer, senior economist at
Bank of America in San Francisco.
   The producer price index measures the prices factories and
other producers receive for their goods. "It doesn't include
services," Mr. Penzer said. "I think there is a problem on
the service side, especially because wages and benefits are
rising substantially."
   This week, the government will release its monthly report
on consumer prices. It covers the cost of services, as well
as goods, at the retail level.
   Many analysts expect inflation to moderate after the spike
at the beginning of the year. The Federal Reserve has been
battling inflation by maintaining high interest rates for a
couple of years now. The economy has slowed substantially as
a result of the central bank campaign, and some people have
begun to worry that the economy would have to fall into
recession in order to make further progress against
inflation.
   A Commerce Department report released Friday indicates
that recession isn't in the picture at the moment. The
department said business inventories shrank 0.4% in February,
while sales jumped 1.3%.
   A pile-up of inventories can set off a chain reaction that
leads to recession by prompting businesses to cut back on
orders, and factories to slow production, to rid their back
lots of excess stock. But there was no sign of that in
February. According to the Commerce Department report, it
would have taken only 1.48 months to sell off inventories,
compared with 1.51 months in January.
   In other good inflation news, the producer price index for
intermediate goods, materials with some processing, showed no
change in March after falling 0.7% the month before. The
index for crude goods tumbled 1.4% after growing 0.4% in
February.
   In addition to the drops in finished food and energy
prices, prices of women's clothing, passenger cars and
household flatware also fell. Gasoline prices slipped 2.8% on
top of a 2.3% decline the month before.
   Prices of men's and boys' clothing edged up. And one
exception to the general decline in energy prices was the
price of fuel oil, which jumped 10.6% after plummeting 30.2%
in February.
                                                                                                       

   Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on
business inventories and sales in February. The figures are
