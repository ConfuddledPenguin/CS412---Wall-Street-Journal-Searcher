   By the time women with heart disease are referred to
surgeons for coronary bypass surgery they are much sicker
than men who are sent to by-pass surgery, researchers in Los
Angeles found in a new study.
   The finding helps explain why women seem to have twice the
risk of men of dying during or immediately after coronary
by-pass surgery. But the finding also hints that doctors may
not be as astute in diagnosing coronary heart disease in
women as they are in men or that they don't regard early
symptoms of heart disease as being as serious in women as in
men.

   The new study by researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center checked the medical records of almost 2,300 patients
who underwent coronary by-pass surgery at the center between
1982 and 1987. They found that the 4.6% of the 482 women died
as a result of the operation, compared with an operative
mortality of only 2.6% for the more than 1,800 men who had
the by-pass operation.
   This gender difference in operative mortality has been
seen in other medical centers. But previous studies blamed
the women's higher mortality on the fact that their hearts
and coronary arteries are smaller than men's, making the
operation technically more difficult. The operation involves
taking a blood vessel from some other part of the body and
stitching it to a coronary artery on the surface of the heart
so that it routs blood around a clogged portion of the
coronary artery.
   The notion of a technical difference was contradicted,
however, in the new study. In their report in the current
issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, the Cedars-Sinai
researchers said they found no evidence that the surgery was
more difficult in women than men. The amount of time surgeons
had to keep the patient on the heart-lung machine was
actually shorter for women than men, suggesting there were
fewer technical problems for the women.
   Instead, the researchers found that the only factors that
correlated with the higher death rate for women was their
older age and greater degree of illness. The mean age of the
women at the time of surgery was 68.2 years, compared with 64
years for men. Almost two-thirds of the women were in the
advanced stages of coronary heart disease at the time they
were referred to surgery, compared with only 45% of the men.
Only 7% of the women were in the early stages of heart
disease, compared with 23% of the men.
   The Cedars-Sinai study by Steven S. Kahn and his
colleagues was launched to see if a sex bias in doctors'
referral of patients for by-pass surgery could account for
the operation being riskier for women. About two years ago
researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New
York found indications that there is a sex bias in patients
undergoing X-ray studies of their coronary arteries prior to
by-pass surgery. They found that 10 times as many men as
women had undergone exercise stress tests and radioactive
heart scans before their doctors decided they needed by-pass
surgery.
   The new Cedars-Sinai study found similar evidence. For
instance, only 32% of the women had had an abnormal finding
on the exercise stress test in which the patient walks a
treadmill while an electrocardiogram is taken. By contrast,
48% of the male patients had had an abnormal stress test.
   This suggested that doctors may wait until a woman shows
clear-cut symptoms of coronary heart disease, such as
unpredictable chest pains known as unstable angina, before
sending her to surgery whereas they would send a male patient
to surgery on the basis of an abnormal stress test.
Alternatively, the researchers speculated, its possible that
once women develop symptoms of coronary heart disease they go
downhill much faster than men and thus are sicker by the time
they reach the operating room.
   "These findings suggest that women are referred for
coronary by-pass surgery later in the course of their disease
and for different reasons than men and that later referral
may significantly increase their chances for operative
death," Dr. Kahn and his colleagues concluded.
   In an accompanying editorial, Nanette K. Wenger of Emory
University medical school in Atlanta, suggested that doctors
may be more complacent about the signifigance of chest pains
in women than in men. She noted that early population studies
found that although angina chest pains were twice as common
among women as men, 75% of the men had heart attacks within
five years after developing the pains, while only 14% of the
women had heart attacks in that time. This led doctors to
believe angina pains weren't as serious in women as in men,
Dr. Wenger noted.
   Dr. Wenger argued that "this flawed myth of better
tolerance of angina {among women} fostered less attention to
women with this symptom, less concern with their preventive
care," and probably led doctors to pay less attention to the
stress test in women than in men.
