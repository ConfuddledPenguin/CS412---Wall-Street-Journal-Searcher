   NEW YORK -- Goldman Sachs -- famed for its cozy
relationships with clients -- is launching the most ambitious
effort on the Street to invest in the rough and tumble world
of bankrupt and other distressed securities.
   Goldman is trying to raise at least $500 million,
including $100 million of its own, for a fund that would
invest large amounts of cash in a small number of financially
troubled companies.

   The effort has raised eyebrows among bankruptcy investors,
who question whether a securities firm known for shunning
hostile takeovers will prosper in the often-hostile world of
restructurings.
   Bankruptcy specialists say Goldman is straying from its
turf. They question whether the firm will be able to raise
money for such ventures. They also appear less than eager to
have Goldman as competition.
   Goldman isn't alone in trying to raise money for
distressed companies, but its prospective fund is the biggest
and -- for its brethren on Wall Street -- the most
significant. Investment banks are hungry to get into the
business of cleaning up the debt-ridden balance sheets they
helped create in the 1980s, but raising money for such
ventures hasn't proved easy.
   "Everyone is looking to see if Goldman can pull it off,"
says Chriss Street of the Reorganized Securities Group in Los
Angeles. "If they can, everyone else will announce
something."
   Goldman's aim is no less than to test the thesis of the
day -- namely, that Wall Street can make money from investing
in, or restructuring, the walking wounded survivors (or
non-survivors) of the leveraged buy-out era. Although Goldman
has been an adviser to Southland, a textbook case of the
problem it aims to cure, the investment bank's record on LBOs
is better than most.
   The potential market, Goldman's sales memorandum notes, is
stocked with victims of "LBO misjudgments, over-optimistic
projections and over-valuations."
   The market is likely to grow in an economic downturn.
   "It's the flip side of the Milken Revolution," says David
Schulte, managing partner of Chilmark Partners in Chicago,
who is co-sponsoring a competing turnaround fund that is
aiming to raise at least $250 million.
   So far, the thesis has attracted more talk than actual
investment. "For all the discussion of such funds there has
been very little investor appetite," says Wilbur Ross, senior
managing director of Rothschild Inc. and a specialist in
restructurings.
   Goldman's bankers say they can't comment during the
offering period. But judging from the terms of its sales
memorandum, Goldman is optimistic. It is banking on raising
at least $100 million by June 15 -- less than 90 days from
the date of its private placement offering memorandum, which
is dated March 22. And it is committed to raising more money
than others have attempted or to giving the funds back. T.
Rowe Price, for instance, took about a year to raise $107
million for its Recovery Fund.
   Goldman's fund is the Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund
I. The name suggests that Goldman aims for II and III down
the road. It is aimed at institutions willing to invest a
minimum of $5 million for four to seven years.
   The sales memo says the firm plans to buy securities of
financially troubled companies "on a basis that may enable it
to influence the recapitalization of those companies." It
aims, in other words, to buy big enough stakes in securities
-- usually bonds -- to be able to force things in its favor
when companies are restructured.
   Martin J. Whitman, a longtime bankruptcy investor, says,
"The business as we do it has confrontation built into it.
It's very hard to be successful if your mind-set is to work
with management. The whiteshoe firms aren't equipped to do
it."
   Mr. Whitman doesn't snipe at Goldman's resources, or at
its name. But, he notes, Goldman prides itself on not doing
hostile deals, and workouts are rarely friendly.
   Goldman acknowledges in its memo that in acting as both an
investment banker and as an investor, it may have to tread
through a thicket of conflicts of interests. It notes, for
instance, a "Chinese Wall" problem; Water Street might be
unable to invest in securities if Goldman has inside
information on them.
   The memo is silent on whether Water Street will buy bonds
of Goldman clients. But, it says, the fund's adviser "will
take into consideration (Goldman's relationships with
clients) in its management of the Fund."
   Presumably, it will look for companies troubled by excess
debt rather than by inferior management. According to the
memo, Goldman believes the combined power of the fund's
capital, Goldman's nose for value and Goldman's investment
banking talents should produce dynamic results.
   The fund plans to "assume an active investment role,
acquire substantial positions and seize initiatives," the
memo says. "Its ability to recognize values must be coupled
with the investment banking capability to effect
restructurings."
   Skeptics note that the fund's managers are corporate
finance generalists more than loan-workout specialists and
that Goldman's own record in investing in distressed
companies appears to be spotty. It has, apparently, prospered
in Penrod Drilling, but not in Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel.
   Goldman's competition, on the other hand, includes
longtime bankruptcy specialists. Mr. Schulte, for instance,
is raising money with Sam Zell. Both men are veteran
"workout" artists, experts in restructuring problem loans.
Joseph, Littlejohn &amp; Levy, also a workout specialist, is
trying to raise $300 million, for another fund to be managed
by Lancer Industries.
   Both funds would seek distressed companies for investments
and operate them for the long term. The Zell fund, raising
money with Merrill Lynch, has a lifetime of 10 to 12 years.
"We will stick around and operate," Mr. Zell says. "This
isn't a flip deal."
   The time horizon of Water Street is shorter than Mr.
Zell's. Water Street's investments would be held, it expects,
from one to three years. It appears to be looking for
companies with management in place -- but in need of
financial engineering.
   Goldman's bankers, were they available to speak,
presumably would add that the firm is no stranger to advising
workout clients. Goldman's sales pitch, in its memo, also
cites its LBO fund, the Broad Street Investment Fund. By
Goldman's estimate, the fund has been earning better than a
35% annual compound return since 1986. The implicit pitch is
that if Goldman didn't stumble too often in the LBO era, it
should be able to play doctor to those who did.
