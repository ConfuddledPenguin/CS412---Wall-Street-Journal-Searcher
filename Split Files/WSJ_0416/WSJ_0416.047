   Selling to college students is no frolicking frat party.
   Trans World Airlines Inc. has learned as much with a
discount promotion it figured was sure-fire. With the
purchase of a $15 card, students get 10% off on all its
flights. Alas, just 3,000 signed up last year. How could
students pass up such a bargain?

   Because they don't know about it, contends Michael DeBoer,
a vice president at A+ Marketing Corp., Hartsdale, N.Y., one
of a number of college-marketing consulting firms that have
sprung up. The airline advertises the cards through brochures
at travel agencies, and, Mr. DeBoer says, students don't use
travel agents. "It's being promoted totally wrong," he
contends.
   If it's missing the mark with the much-coveted campus
crowd, TWA isn't alone. College students are tricky to snag.
They're always pressed for time, removed from many marketing
channels, inherently skeptical and increasingly
sophisticated. Many have a new-found independence away from
home, and so want to be treated as adults, yet have different
interests than people out in the workaday world. What's more,
trends and tastes change with every graduating class, if not
each semester, making it tough for advertising executives to
keep up with them.
   A common pitfall, according to many college-marketing
specialists, is for advertisers to wrongly assume they can
reach students through their mainstream promotions. Tambrands
Inc. came across badly in a focus group with an ad for its
First Response home pregnancy test. The ad featured a happy
couple, with the man asking, "So which is it, yes or no?" and
the woman responding, "Now, why do you think I'm smiling?"
   Students in the focus group said the scenario implied that
the test was positive -- which to most students is a big
negative. Following the advice of the group, Tambrands
changed its ads to address students' concern -- anxiety over
a possible pregnancy. The ads now say, in part: "Until you
know, nothing else matters."
   Too often, marketing executives lump students in an "under
35" category or approach the market as they remember it from
their college days. "A lot of executives will take their own
experience or their kids' and project that onto the market,"
says Stuart Himmelfarb, president of CollegeTrack Inc.,
another marketing specialist. "Since we've all been through
college, we tend to think things haven't changed that much."
   There's little doubt that the college market is worth
pursuing. There are 13 million college students nationwide,
many of them affluent and prone to duplicate their
classmates' purchases. CollegeTrack Inc. calculates there are
7.4 million full-time undergraduate students in the U.S., and
they have average disposable income of $114 a month. The
opportunity for building product loyalty is also great: Every
satisfied customer is a potential buyer for decades to come.
   Yet many companies spend their ad dollars in the wrong
place. Although TWA says it believes its marketing effort
through travel agencies "is a cost effective" technique, Mr.
DeBoer says putting up posters at schools and advertising in
college newspapers would be a better way to reach students.
   Tambrands originally ran its First Response ads in class
directories, which are used during registration, when
students are selecting courses. Collegiate Advantage Inc., a
college-market consulting firm in Boston, saw the ads and
approached the company with suggestions for new advertising
outlets, saying that directories are better for advertising
things like computers and calculators. Now, Tambrands puts
its new ads in college newspapers.
   Perhaps the biggest mistake companies make in their
approach to the market is talking down to students, according
to marketing specialists. Miller Brewing Co. had to cancel a
16-page glossy advertising supplement that was running in
student newspapers last spring after students at several
universities expressed outrage at the beer company's
promotion. Students complained in letters to the editor that
the supplement, titled Beachin' Times, was insulting,
presenting college life as one where party animals chase
"unbelievable babes," "sleep 'til noon" and don't know
sentence structure.
   "I think a lot of companies think people are dumb and
uneducated and that the lowest common denominator is the best
route to take in ads. But it's offensive to these kids," says
Bill Tragos, chief executive officer of TBWA Advertising
Inc., a New York advertising agency.
   "Of any consumer group, college students are the most
critical," says Frederick Elkind, vice president and director
of TrendSights, a division of ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather Inc.
"If you do things that border on silly or insulting, they can
really be turned off."
   Miller has since switched its student promotions to
point-of-purchase advertising during the traditional
spring-break period. This year, the company has set up a
"Miller Welcome Center" under a giant tent in Daytona Beach,
Fla., where students can play games and make a music video
for free. Miller is advertising the promotions on local
Florida radio stations.
   So what does score well with the college crowd? Not
surprisingly, one way to reach students is with students
themselves.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which has in-house
specialists on college marketing, scored big with its student
testimonial ads in campus newspapers. The ads, which stress
the importance of long-distance calls as the connection to
home, use real students in real campus-life situations and
have received applause in student focus groups nationwide.
   Levi Strauss &amp; Co.'s 501 jeans promotions have also been a
hit in student polls. The documentary-style ads show young
adults in various parts of the country doing things
characteristic of that region, such as boating in a Louisiana
bayou.
   "In about half of the {promotions}, the kids in the ads
are real students off the street," says Dan Chew, a marketing
manager for Levi Strauss. Since the campaign began in 1984,
sales of 501 jeans -- whose market is mostly college-age
people -- have more than doubled, the company says.
   Sexy ads also sell on campus, advertisers have found,
especially when they're mixed with the unexpected. Calvin
Klein Cosmetics Co.'s television ad for Eternity, a
fragrance, appeals to college students, research shows. In
it, a man asks a woman, "Would you still love me if I were a
woman?" The woman responds: "Of course. If I could be your
man."
   Besides being sexy, "They're rather avant-garde," says
Sherman Agins, executive vice president at CollegeTrack.
"Students are more accepting of that kind of approach than
the mainstream."
