   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court barred the Federal
Aviation Administration from imposing civil fines of $50,000
or less on airlines for safety violations without first going
to court.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the FAA improperly
adopted rules to establish the safety enforcement program
that was authorized by Congress as an experiment in 1987.

   Gregory Walden, chief counsel of the FAA, called the
decision "a setback" to agency enforcement efforts. "I
consider it significant," he said.
   Mr. Walden said that since the FAA adopted rules for the
enforcement program in September 1988, penalties have been
imposed in 1,800 cases, while another 3,800 cases have been
initiated. He said the ruling "may wreak havoc on the system"
if airlines or their employees try to reopen cases in which
penalties already have been imposed.
   The 1987 law increased to $10,000 from $1,000 the maximum
civil fine for each airline safety violation; as an
experiment, Congress said that for violations cumulatively
totaling less than $50,000, the FAA could impose the
penalties directly, without following the usual course of
referring the agency's complaints to U.S. attorneys' offices
to file suit in court. For fines of more than $50,000, the
FAA must still refer the cases to a U.S. attorney.
   But in a lawsuit filed by the major airlines' trade group,
the Air Transport Association of America, the appeals court
said the FAA improperly adopted rules to implement the
experiment. The appeals court said the agency failed to give
public notice of the proposed rules or to allow a period of
public comment.
   The Air Transport Association also argued that the
procedures adopted by the FAA are unfair, but the appeals
court didn't take a position on that issue. The decision,
written by Judge Harry Edwards, also didn't state whether
completed cases may be reopened to object to adoption of the
rules, meaning that issue will have to be tested in other
lawsuits.
   Judge Laurence Silberman dissented, saying the FAA rules
are "procedural" in nature and, therefore, may be adopted by
an agency without public notice and comment.
   The FAA's Mr. Walden said that of the 5,600 cases
initiated to date, 3,640 involved security violations by the
airlines or their employees. Many of these are cases in which
the FAA sends test objects, such as mock guns, through
airline security checkpoints to see whether detection devices
spot them.
   Other types of cases that the FAA has handled through the
enforcement program involve safety-related maintenance and
operational violations. The program generally doesn't apply
to cases in which safety violations may have caused or
contributed to causes of plane crashes; these cases are
handled by the National Transportation Safety Board and
probably involve fines of more than $50,000.
   Mr. Walden was unsure whether the FAA will now issue new
rules or whether it will appeal, either to the full 10-member
appeals court or to the Supreme Court.
   Meanwhile, Michael Sundermeyer, a Washington lawyer who
represented the Air Transport Association, said the
experimental enforcement program is due to expire on April
30, unless Congress extends it. The court ruling, he said,
may help dissuade Congress from extending the program. "The
consensus in the aviation community is that it has been
unfairly implemented," he said.
