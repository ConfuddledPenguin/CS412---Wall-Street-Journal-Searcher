   BOSTON -- At an awards dinner last June, Neil Colvin,
founder of Phoenix Technologies Ltd., was named New England's
software entrepreneur of the year.
   It's been downhill ever since.

   Even as Mr. Colvin's accomplishments were being lauded,
Phoenix was faltering. The company had bet millions of
dollars on a product diversification that turned out to be a
flop. Flush with cash from going public in 1988, it had spent
lavishly, even opening offices in Honolulu and southern
France. On some of Mr. Colvin's West Coast trips, the company
lodged him in a $605-a-night Beverly Hills hotel suite.
   Phoenix became a classic case of the rapidly growing small
company led astray by its own success. Though still a small
company, it spent like a big one. "Phoenix saw itself as
larger than life," says David F. Parkinson, who resigned last
month as chief financial officer, one of a number of recent
defections from Phoenix's management, sales and engineering
ranks. A spokesman says the company is working to replace
those who have left and "still has a strong core of
engineering talent."
   Phoenix was indeed playing in the big leagues. It supplied
a key element of the mid-'80s personal-computer boom: the
basic input-output software to operate millions of clones of
International Business Machines Corp. PCs. It counted among
its customers some of the biggest PC makers, such as Tandy
Corp. and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. Sales soared to
$52.6 million in the year ended last Sept. 30 from $7.2
million in fiscal 1985.
   But now, Phoenix is shrinking. It had a loss of $4.9
million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit
of $2.86 million in the year-earlier period. And the company
expects to report another loss for the quarter ended March
31. Sales in the December quarter plunged 47% to $7.8 million
from $14.6 million a year earlier. The company has slashed
its work force by more than one-third. And Phoenix faces the
possibility of a hostile takeover, threatened last month by a
disgruntled investor.
   "They had an extraordinary strategic advantage in the
hottest part of the computer business, and they blew it,"
says David Pearl, a technology analyst who backed the
purchase of a stake in Phoenix by his former employer BEA
Associates Inc., a New York investment company. Mr. Pearl,
who owns shares in Phoenix himself, says he still thinks the
company can rebound.
   Mr. Colvin contends his company is on the road to
recovery. "We have no debt, a strong market position, $10
million in cash and we're running cash flow neutral to
positive now," he says. "Lots of companies would like to have
our problems." One big customer, Japan's NEC Corp., says
Phoenix's core product line has stayed competitive. Another
big customer, AT&amp;T, says it is still pleased with engineering
work Phoenix has done for it.
   Analysts, investors and former employees place much of the
blame for Phoenix's problems on Mr. Colvin and his top
managers. By all accounts an accomplished software designer,
Mr. Colvin claims little interest in day-to-day details of
the business and was persuaded to step down as chairman in
February to become chief scientist, or in his words, "senior
guru and architect."
   With a 27% stake in the company, Mr. Colvin is the largest
Phoenix shareholder and still wields plenty of influence. The
1988 public offering, at $15 a share, made him rich -- and
brought in $37 million to Phoenix. But instead of fueling
growth, the cash almost killed the company, and the stock
price has fallen to $2.75 a share.
   Executives say Phoenix's most costly mistake was its foray
into the emerging market for software geared to the Unix
computer operating system. The company jumped on the Sun
Microsystems Inc. bandwagon -- hoping to create products that
would allow companies to make Sun-compatible computers, based
on Unix software, just as it had helped to create the huge
IBM-compatible computer market.
   But in effect, Phoenix was trying to build a market that
would help Sun at the expense of all its other customers of
the previous eight years. "Phoenix tried to expand in too
many directions at one time, and it got out of control," says
Lawrence Finch, a San Jose, Calif., venture capitalist and
the only non-management member of the board. "Some
professional management would have been real helpful earlier
on. . . . But the customers haven't gone away, and the
company still holds a strategic place in the computer
business."
   For a time, though, Phoenix's dizzying growth not only
masked the problems but led to grandiose plans. "We had lots
of money and lots of plans," Mr. Colvin now says. "The
incredible growth we were having gave everybody a sense of
euphoria." After the public offering, Mr. Colvin wanted to
buy a private jet and move into a huge building on Boston's
Route 128 with room for 1,000 workers. (The company did
neither.) At its peak in 1989, Phoenix employed 420 people.
   At the same time, the company spent millions of dollars on
large offices, in the U.S. and abroad, filled with expensive
furnishings. One unit with 14 people ordered 80 office chairs
costing $300 each.
   Mr. Colvin concedes that he grew increasingly distant from
day-to-day operations. Employees say morale sagged.
   Finally, under mounting pressure, Phoenix last September
slashed its payroll and ended its Unix research effort. It
took a $5.5 million restructuring charge against earnings for
the year ended Sept. 30, wrote off some $7.9 million in bad
debts, and closed its offices in Hawaii and France, among
other places. Phoenix says it established the Honolulu office
to be closer to its Asian customers. But, according to a
former Phoenix engineer, many of the Asian customers declined
to come to Honolulu for fear the trips would look like
junkets.
   At the same time, Phoenix named Ronald Fisher, chief of a
small Eastman Kodak Co. subsidiary, as president and chief
executive officer, ending a merry-go-round of management
changes at the top. Mr. Fisher, a longtime friend of Mr.
Colvin, also became the fifth member of the board.
   The company also tightened its revenue-recognition
practices, booking business when it was paid for, rather than
when the first part of an order was shipped. The new revenue
policy exposed the precarious state of the company's growth.
"Sooner or later, if there's a slowdown in the business, that
kind of accounting catches up with you and leads to a
tremendous revenue drop," Mr. Fisher says. The new accounting
method "will build a solid, predictable revenue stream," he
says.
   Some investors aren't convinced. Norwood Partners, an
investment group led by Daniel Barnett -- a venture
capitalist who got a stake in Phoenix after it bought a
company he had funded -- decided last month that he'd had
enough. He announced that he was interested in acquiring a
majority stake, at $5 a share, to take the company private.
"They built a fantastic franchise, and it's not too late to
turn it around," Mr. Barnett says.
   Phoenix immediately rejected the proposal. "We have an
undervalued stock on our hands," Mr. Fisher says. "We don't
want to sell."
   Not every investor lost out. Securities and Exchange
Commission filings show that Phoenix executives, including
Mr. Colvin, sold shares with uncanny timing -- sometimes days
before bad news drove down the stock. For example, Mr. Colvin
sold a total of 65,000 shares in early March, shortly before
the company announced on March 13 that it expected to report
a big loss for the fiscal second quarter.
   Mr. Parkinson, the former financial officer, says he left
Phoenix over the board's failure to act on such trading by
Mr. Colvin and a second senior executive.
   Mr. Colvin says he was unaware the company was about to
announce bad news when he sold shares. As for Phoenix's
problems, he is blunt. "You reach the end of the cliff, and
you either stop in time, or you go over," he says. "Once you
start falling, you go into free fall."
