   Leigh Instruments Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary of Plessey
Co. of Britain, filed for bankruptcy-law protection with
debts of more than 100 million Canadian dollars (US$86
million).
   Leigh, a Kanata, Ontario, defense contractor, was acquired
by Plessey in 1988. Plessey is jointly owned by General
Electric Co. of Britain, an electronics and industrial
engineering company, and Siemens AG of West Germany, an
electronics concern.

   Leigh issued layoff notices to its 750 employees at its
Ontario plants and offices at Toronto, Kanata and Carleton
Place. The company's creditors are unsecured with Canadian
banks carrying a substantial amount of the debt. Peat Marwick
Thorne Inc., Toronto, was named trustee for the filing.
   Leigh executives blamed their financial problems on cost
overruns on defense contracts. The company estimated it had a
loss of about C$73 million on sales of C$63 million in the
year ended March 31.
   Leigh has supplied communications equipment for Canadian
destroyers and for Canada's F-18 fighter planes. The company
also produced ground-based navigation systems, flight data
recorders and safety-related avionics equipment.
