   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca received 10.8% more in total compensation in 1989
than in 1988, largely because he took in more from exercising
stock options.
   Mr. Iacocca's total compensation last year was $3,976,359,
with $2,413,600, or about 61% of the total, coming from stock
options, according to the No. 3 U.S. auto maker's proxy
statement. His salary rose 2.7% to $889,151, while the bonus
applied to 1988 earnings fell 12.5% to $525,000.

   Mr. Iacocca also received 6,174 shares of Chrysler stock
valued at $148,608 under the auto maker's long-term incentive
plan. In the preceding year, his long-term incentive
compensation was 7,056 shares with a value of $159,254.
   Chrysler has said it isn't paying any bonuses on 1989
earnings because it didn't make enough money to pay
profit-sharing to hourly employees. Chrysler traditionally
pays bonuses in the spring for the preceding year.
   Gerald Greenwald, Chrysler vice chairman, was the
company's second highest-paid executive, with total
compensation of $1,133,637, roughly flat with a year earlier.
His salary, like Mr. Iacocca's, rose 2.7% to $650,972, while
his bonus from 1988 earnings fell 16.7% to $375,000.
   Mr. Greenwald didn't exercise any stock options in 1989,
but did receive 4,473 shares of Chrysler stock valued at
$107,665 under the long-term incentive plan, down 6.7% from
1988.
   The proxy statement shows Chrysler suspended corporate
contributions to its salaried employee savings plan on Oct.
1. The plan was suspended as "a money-saving operation," a
company spokesman said. The savings will be counted toward
the $1.5 billion Chrysler has pledged to cut by year end from
costs.
   Chrysler previously suspended payments during 1987,
reinstating them in July 1988. "That, historically, is one of
the things that has gone in and out depending on the health
of the company," the spokesman said. Chrysler reported a net
loss of $664 million for the fourth quarter, after a $577
million charge for, among other things, closing plants and
discontinuing certain car lines. Analysts expect Chrysler did
little better than break even in the quarter that ended March
30.
   The proxy statement also says Chrysler gave Allen E.
Paulson 146,520 shares of Chrysler stock prior to Chrysler's
March sale of its Gulfstream Aerospace unit to a group
controlled by Mr. Paulson and Forstmann Little &amp; Co. The
stock was to settle an employment contract with Mr. Paulson,
the chairman of Gulfstream, that could have awarded him as
many as 1,406,250 Chrysler shares for meeting certain
performance goals.
   The proxy statement also discloses Chrysler has begun
paying $5,000 of its annual $20,000 directors' fee in company
stock instead of paying the entire fee in cash. The move is
consistent with Mr. Iacocca's efforts to get company
executives to own more Chrysler shares. And according to the
statement, Chrysler bought materials, supplies and services
from more than 16,000 U.S. and Canadian companies in 1989.
That's 11.1% fewer than in 1988; the amount paid to all
suppliers world-wide dropped only fractionally, however, to
$21.9 billion from $22.1 billion.
