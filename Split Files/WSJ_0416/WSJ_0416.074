   HAMILTON, Bermuda -- President Bush said he found a new
Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania "deeply disturbing," but he
declined to say whether he was considering steps to counter
threatened economic sanctions.
   In a joint news conference with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, whom he met Friday for a day of talks,
President Bush sounded his oft-repeated call for negotiations
over the republic's drive to break from the Soviet Union.

   On Friday, Soviet leaders seemed to step up their threats
against the republic. In a letter to Lithuania's president,
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev vowed to block shipments of
unspecified "essential" goods within 48 hours if the republic
didn't halt its independence moves. It is believed Mr.
Gorbachev was referring to such goods as oil, natural gas and
coal, which are readily converted into hard currency.
   (As Moscow's deadline for concessions from Lithuania went
unheeded yesterday, the Kremlin warned Washington against
risking a return to Cold War tensions over Lithuania's
independence claim.)
   Calling reports of the Gorbachev letter to Lithuania's
leaders "deeply disturbing," Mr. Bush said on Friday that
"now is no time for escalation; it's time for talk." But
asked what steps the U.S. would take if the sanctions were
imposed, Mr. Bush said he didn't have enough information
about the specifics of the Soviet threat to respond.
   Prime Minister Thatcher used somewhat stronger language,
saying that while she wasn't "lecturing" Mr. Gorbachev, she
was entitled to express a view, and that "this isn't a
problem that should be solved by force and which cannot be
solved by force."
