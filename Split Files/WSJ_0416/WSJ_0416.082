   PITTSBURGH -- New York investors Japonica Partners
launched a tender offer for about $134 million principal
amount for various debt securities of Allegheny International
Inc.
   Japonica, which recently acquired enough bank claims to
make it Allegheny's largest creditor, said the total purchase
price of the securities involved in the tender offer is about
$56.6 million. Allegheny, the maker of Sunbeam and Oster
appliances, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection
against creditors in February 1988.

   Allegheny and Japonica Partners have proposed rival plans
to bring Allegheny out of those proceedings. Allegheny's
plan, which consists of paying claims in stock, failed to
receive approval by two-thirds majority after Japonica voted
against it. Japonica's plan consists of paying creditors in
cash through a $655 million buy-out of the company. Both
plans are scheduled for hearings later this month.
   The securities involved in the tender offer include:
Allegheny's 9% subordinated sinking fund debentures due 1989
for 39.8% of their principal amount; 10 3/4% subordinated
sinking fund debentures due 1999 for 41% of their principal
amount; and 10.4% subordinated sinking fund debentures due
2002 for 27.7% of their principal amount. The tender offer
also includes the 9% sinking fund debentures of Allegheny's
Chemetron unit due 1994 for 83.8% of their principal amount.
   Allegheny said it didn't have any comment on Japonica's
tender offer.
   Japonica said the tender offer, which began Saturday, is
subject to certain conditions, excluding financing. It didn't
disclose the conditions. The offer is scheduled to expire at
5:01 p.m. EDT May 15.
