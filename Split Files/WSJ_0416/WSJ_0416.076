   NEW YORK -- Software entrepreneur Frank H. Dodge dropped a
previously disclosed lawsuit in Massachusetts that alleged
Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. and the software company he founded
were interfering with his efforts to get re-established in
the industry.
   Through his attorneys, Mr. Dodge filed a notice of
voluntary dismissal in state Superior Court in Cambridge,
Mass., late Friday. The action came a day after the court had
declined to issue a preliminary injunction against Dun &amp;
Bradstreet that Mr. Dodge had sought as part of his lawsuit.

   Yesterday, a Dun &amp; Bradstreet spokesman hailed the move as
a vindication. Mr. Dodge left the company earlier this year.
As reported, he had alleged that Dun &amp; Bradstreet fired him
without cause as president and chief executive of the
McCormack &amp; Dodge software unit. Thus, the suit argued, he
wasn't bound by an agreement that bars him from competing
against the software company for a year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet
responded that Mr. Dodge resigned and therefore was subject
to the terms of the agreement.
   Mr. Dodge and a co-founder sold McCormack &amp; Dodge to Dun &amp;
Bradstreet in 1983, and he had stayed on as president.
