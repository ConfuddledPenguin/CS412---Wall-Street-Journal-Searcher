   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is in a quandary, caught
between his desire to reward a foreign friend, Japan's Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, and his inclination to avoid
political firefights at home.
   The president's dilemma arises because of a politically
charged decision he must make by the end of this month:
whether to name Japan an unfair trading partner again, as he
did last year. If he does, he will set off a new round of
trade investigations and negotiations and renew the specter
of U.S. sanctions on Tokyo.

   The debate pits Bush adviser against Bush adviser. The
president earlier this year hosted Mr. Kaifu, Japan's new and
politically vulnerable leader, at a private dinner in Palm
Springs, Calif., and pressed him for basic change in Japan's
trade behavior. Mr. Kaifu has worked hard to build this
personal bond, even telephoning Mr. Bush twice within a week
this month to stress his efforts to make changes.
   Since then, Japan signed a ballyhooed agreement to lower
its structural trade barriers, and it agreed to give
Americans a better shot at selling satellites and
supercomputers in its markets. White House aides say Mr. Bush
would like to reward Mr. Kaifu's political courage.
   Yet if Mr. Bush doesn't cite Japan as an unfair trader, he
faces a political explosion in Congress, where even fellow
Republicans will charge he has let Japan off the hook. "Mr.
President, you must not let this happen," Republican Sen.
John Danforth warned the White House in a letter a few days
ago.
   The issue is so sensitive that none of the key
administration players will disclose the president's
position. But administration officials expect the
administration's chief "free trade" disciples, chief White
House economist Michael Boskin and Budget Director Richard
Darman, to argue that enough progress has been made in trade
talks with Japan that the U.S. shouldn't cite Tokyo again and
risk a protectionist war. The pair are likely to be supported
by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of State
James Baker.
   Pushing hard to cite Japan again will be Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, administration aides predict.
Somewhere between the two camps, officials say, is Trade
Representative Carla Hills, who pressed to cite Japan last
year but is more ambivalent this year.
   The balance in the debate is likely to be tipped by the
current difficult negotiations to open Japan's market to U.S.
wood products, senior Bush administration aides say. Wood
products were one of three areas targeted last year when
President Bush first named Japan as an unfair trader under
the so-called Super 301 provision of the 1988 U.S. trade law.
Agreements have been reached to satisfy U.S. complaints about
Japanese trade barriers in the other two areas cited,
satellites and supercomputers.
   If the wood-product negotiations also produce a
significant agreement by Japan to lower trade barriers, even
the trade warriors in the Commerce Department may be
convinced that Japan doesn't deserve to be slapped again
under Super 301, one senior administration aide said.
   U.S. officials said in Tokyo they made "significant
progress" in the wood negotiations but hadn't reached an
agreement. The officials said chances are good an accord will
be reached before the end of the month. But because of the
uncertainty, administration officials say there won't be a
decision on whether to cite Japan again as an unfair trader
until just before the April 30 statutory deadline.
   Central to the administration debate is the question of
what tactical approachconstant pressure or rewarding good
behavior -- will best produce further opening of Japan's
markets. A long list of U.S. industries, notably
semiconductors and auto parts, are pushing for more Super 301
actions against Japan to open up markets in their areas. They
argue that only last year's pressure produced the progress
made so far, and they say only continued pressure will
produce more concessions.
   Those businesses have powerful allies in the Commerce
Department, the Trade Representative's Office and among
Republicans on Capitol Hill. "I've never seen the mood of
Congress as frustrated and as impatient as it is today," says
Sen. John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican active on trade
issues. "My belief is that it would be very poorly received
in Congress if the administration were to blink" and not cite
Japan again as an unfair trader.
   But a growing segment of the administration argues that
citing Japan again might halt progress and imperil Prime
Minister Kaifu, seen by some Bush aides as a champion of
reforming Japan's trade practices.
   Mr. Kaifu, whose base within Japan's ruling party isn't
very wide or strong, has staked much of his political future
on improving trade relations with the U.S. and he has taken
intense political heat at home for making trade concessions
in the past few weeks. If Mr. Kaifu's only reward for
championing change is to be slapped again by the U.S., some
administration aides argue, he will lose credibility inside
Japan.
   President Bush, who hosted the prime minister at a dinner
in Palm Springs this year and grilled him about the need for
change in Japan's ways, is grateful for the political courage
Mr. Kaifu has shown so far and would like to reward him,
White House officials say. But Mr. Bush also hears the
political rumblings at home that say it's too soon to ease
the pressure. "We're not completely home free yet," says Sen.
