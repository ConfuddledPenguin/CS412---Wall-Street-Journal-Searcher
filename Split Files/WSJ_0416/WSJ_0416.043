   NEW YORK -- When it comes to fishing lures, Seth Rosenbaum
has a bigger appetite than most fish.
   By his own reckoning, Mr. Rosenbaum, a computer consultant
from New York City's borough of Queens, has accumulated about
20,000 of the fish-fooling devices. Some resemble natural
baits, such as minnows or mice. Others have been hammered
from metal into abstract serpentine curves. Lures by the
thousands line the walls of his walk-in closet, while his
pants and jackets hang in disarray on a rack in his bedroom.
Still other lures spill over his kitchen counter or lie on
the floor in tangled jumbles of hooks and feathers.

   This Dennis-the-Menace mess, however, is worth a small
fortune. Although most lures don't yet bring the same prices
as Navaho rugs or Mission style furniture, one small metal
fish lure called a Haskell Minnow sold for $20,350 two years
ago. More recently, Mr. Rosenbaum says he rejected a $4,000
offer for a minnow-shaped "Jersey Expert."
   To the amusement of many sportsmen, old fishing lures are
becoming big business in the burgeoning collectibles field.
There is a national lure club with more than 3,000 members,
an auction house committed to building the market, and an
ever increasing number of new books available on the topic.
There is even a National Fishing Tackle Museum in Arcadia,
Okla., although it has yet to benefit from the craze. In
fact, so few folks visit that the museum's owner is offering
it for sale for $1.2 million.
   "This is a fascinating hobby if you get bit by the bug,"
drawls Clyde Harbin, a collector who has narrated four
videotapes aimed at the lure market. "The only problem is
that you can't get enough of the good ones."
   Nobody knows when lure manufacturing started in this
country, but Vermont fisherman Julio T. Buel received the
first lure patent in 1852. Legend has it that Mr. Buel
accidentally dropped an ordinary spoon in the water, only to
watch in awe as a nice-sized trout swallowed it. This
breakthrough in lure research enabled him to build a
successful factory in Whitehall, N.Y., and his graceful metal
lures can be seen in a museum there.
   Following Mr. Buel's lead, fishermen by the thousands
filed patents for their own sure-fire fish catchers. Archer
Wakeman's Skeleton Bait resembled a miniature helicopter with
hooks attached. Harry Comstock's wooden bodied Flying
Helgramite looked like a deranged insect.
   Many old lure companies started making their baits from
cedar, on hand-operated lathes. The lures were later primed
to prevent them from swelling and cracking when they got wet.
Only then did factory hands paint them and attach hooks.
Every color represented a manufacturing step, including the
addition of gill marks around the face. The eyes, usually
made of glass, were imported from Germany.
   "The old lures had a lot more character than the plastic
ones most fishermen use today," says Paul Caruso, an
obsessive collector who despite running only a modest
fishing-tackle store in Connecticut, last year paid $5,500
for a Miller's Reversible Minnow. "A modern lure usually has
a plastic seam. A hundred years ago, some lures were made
with German silver. You can't compare the quality."
   Many lure makers had a sense of whimsy. There are
bare-breasted Mermaid lures, lures shaped like beer bottles
and fiendishly cruel lures which keep live frogs trapped in
place for hungry bass to swallow. Many have exotic names,
such as the bat-like South Bend Vacuum Bait, or the
pencil-shaped Woods Poppa-Doodle or the Paw Paw Weedless Wow,
a frog lure designed to avoid snagging on lily pads.
   "A lot of what I collect now was really designed to catch
fishermen, not fish," says Richard Streater, a lure historian
who travels the West Coast giving lure chats. "The general
public doesn't care when a plug was made, but if the legs
kick or the eyes blink, that's entertainment."
   Fishing tackle buffs say lure collectors tend to be
blue-collar workers who enjoy fishing and the outdoors.
"Usually they are a little zany," says Bob Lang, an
engineering professor and professional cataloger of fishing
memorabilia. "Fly collectors are serious and soft-spoken; rod
collectors are intense and extremely critical; reel
collectors are technical minded. But lure collectors like to
huddle in corners, tell stories, and swap their Creek Chub
Beetles." Creek Chub Beetles were made in Indiana and looked
like squat ladybugs with pearl-finish attachments.
   Old lures may catch collectors, but they won't be used for
catching fish, since water is an old plug's worst enemy.
Nostalgia, not practicality, drives this market. "A lot of
collectors are reliving their childhood," says Mr. Lang.
"When they were kids, they'd walk into a tackle shop, gaze at
all these wonderful things, and only have 39 cents in their
pockets. Today they can afford them."
   Others see lures as a poor man's investment opportunity,
and they stalk local flea markets and antique stores for
bargains. "Half the thrill is the hunt," says Albert Munger,
who works for the city of Philadelphia. "Collectors I know
are up at 4 a.m. and out at the flea markets with their
flashlights. We're talking about real diehards." Mr. Munger
keeps several thousand lures on his bedroom walls, much to
the chagrin of his wife.
   The idea of paying money for old lures is a new concept.
Back in the 1970s, lure collectors traded with each other,
swapping lures and reels like kids with baseball cards. Even
in the early 1980s, a really expensive lure cost only $30.
Most sold for $5 or $10 apiece.
   All that changed dramatically about five years ago, says
Raymond Carver, president of the National Fishing Lure
Collector's Club, when Maine auctioneer Richard Oliver
visited one of the national shows.
   "When I first met him and his entourage, they conveyed the
idea that this was a fantastic hobby and that demand would
increase faster than supply," says Mr. Carver. "He said he
was going to show us what this stuff is really worth. He did,
unfortunately."
   Much to Mr. Carver's dismay, fishing lures began
attracting as many investors as collectors, and as it did,
prices rose. Now Mr. Carver says he is hard-pressed to add to
his own collection because he doesn't want to pay $500 or
more for the hard-to-find plugs which interest him.
   "Lure collecting used to be something you did with
friends," says Mr. Carver. "Now it's become a question of
supply, demand, and merchandising." Mr. Oliver agrees that he
may well have created the lure market, but says many of those
who have sold lures through his company are glad he did so.
   Contrary to what most collectors seem to think, however,
basic laws of supply and demand also apply to the lure
market. Every time an old lure brings a spectacular price,
folks around the country scramble like mad through their
attics or basements looking for similar baits.
   The results can be wild swings in prices, especially when
there are more lures than collectors. Knowledgeable dealers,
for example, say that the Haskell Minnow which sold for
$20,350 is now worth less than half of that amount. Why?
Because as many as 35 to 40 such plugs have since been found.
   But the diehard lure mongers like Seth Rosenbaum don't
really care. "I'm in the position of somebody who has bought
a $600 stock for $2," says Mr. Rosenbaum. "If it drops $100,
what's the difference? I'm a collector at heart."
