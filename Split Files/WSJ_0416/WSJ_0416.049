   Faucet Demands Get
   Creative Juices Flowing

   PLUMBING suppliers are making it easier to turn on the
water.
   Responding to new rules about the disabled and to
complaints from young and old, manufacturers are redesigning
faucets and introducing high-tech devices that don't have to
be touched.
   Kohler offers a T-shaped handle for ease of gripping. KWC
AG, a Swiss company, designs a spherical handle with finger
grooves. Distributed by WSMC of Costa Mesa, Calif., the
handle is supposed to permit easy turning even for wet, soapy
hands.
   James Datka, marketing manager at American Standard, sees
"a trend away" from knobs to lever faucets, which can be
turned with a mere slap. Delta Faucet now makes most of its
handles comply with federal standards for the handicapped.
   No-touch, infra-red faucets have sensors that react when
they detect an object in their energy field. Hygienic and
frugal with water, infra-red technology is becoming popular
in public washrooms. Drawbacks have kept them out of homes:
You can't adjust the water volume, and infrared sometimes is
triggered by a stray beam of sunlight.
   Ultra-sound technology avoids the sunlight problem, says
Klaus Baumann, president of DAL American Inc., a faucet maker
in Michigan City, Ind.
   American homeowners still put faucet form ahead of
function, says Donald Norman, a cognitive scientist at the
University of California/San Diego. "They use faucets," he
says, "the way they use wristwatches -- to make statements
about themselves."
                                                                                                       

   Designers Draw a Line
   At Certain Products
                                                                                                       

   DESIGNERS sometimes have ideals that prevent them from
sharing ideas.
   Read Viemeister of Yellow Springs, Ohio, refuses to design
highway billboards. They're "a blight on the landscape," he
says. Milton Glaser of New York won't design cigarette
packaging.
   Several years ago, Anita Hersh, a partner in New York's
Lister Butler, led a successful effort to prevent her firm
from designing beer packaging for Coors Brewing Co. At the
time, she believes, Coors was anti-labor and racially
discriminatory. In addition, Ms. Hersh claims company
patriarch Adolph Coors supported anti-Semitic causes. Coors
"is better now," she adds.
   (Swede Johnson, Coors's vice president for corporate
affairs, replies: "I'm delighted Ms. Hersh thinks we're doing
better.")
   Schecter Group recently turned down a request to design
packaging for an electronic toy that Chief Alvin Schecter
deemed "exploitive" of children. Meanwhile, the New
York-based group designed herbicide and pesticide packaging
for DowElanco, a merger of parts of Dow Chemical and Eli
Lilly. But Schecter persuaded the new company to "take
responsibility" for the chemicals inside by putting its name
more prominently on the package.
   Source/Inc. of Chicago refused to work on a high-proof
alcoholic beverage that a longstanding client wanted to aim
at the college market. William O'Connor, a partner, believes
that prosperous design firms are probably the only ones that
can afford to turn down work on moral grounds. "I don't know
what we would have done about that drink if we hadn't had
other work," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Map Makers Take Off
   In New Directions
                                                                                                       

   MAP MAKERS try new ways to draw attention and convey
information.
   Access Press Ltd. of New York has published a road atlas
that divides the U.S. into 250-mile squares, a comfortable
day's drive, instead of states. Unlike most other atlases, it
uses one scale throughout. White roads against a dark
background are supposed to make the maps easier to read, even
at twilight.
   Designer Richard Saul Wurman says he undertook the atlas
after planning a trip across the U.S., "only to find that
there were absolutely no road maps I could understand."
   New York's VanDam Inc. brings out "The Cosmos Unfolds," a
series of "ecoguides" to the rain forest, ocean, universe,
desert, Mars and the Moon, combining science and history. The
guides, made of stiff paper, unfold to six times their
original area and automatically spring back to their folds
when the user's done.
   MicroGuide, a Teaneck, N.J., company, makes credit-card
size maps of the New York subway system, Washington, D.C.,
and other spots. The maps pop into a box shape to be viewed
through a built-in magnifying lens.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   TO HELP SAVE the rain forest, Nienkamper Furniture of
Toronto introduces office furniture that looks like it's made
from tropical hardwoods but is actually from composites of
maple and other plentiful woods. . . . The Hermitage Museum,
the Soviet Union's most important, picks Pentagram Design of
London, New York and San Francisco to do its main catalogs.
