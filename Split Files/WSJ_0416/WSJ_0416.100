   WASHINGTON -- The business people of Richmond, Ind., had a
lot on their minds last week when they had breakfast with
former Federal Reserve Governor Andrew Brimmer. There was the
thrift crisis, interest rates, the recession threat, Japan,
Rust Belt unemployment and the peace dividend. But to Mr.
Brimmer's surprise, not a single mention of inflation.
   Inflation hasn't gone away, however. In the past 12
months, consumer prices have risen 5.3%. That's higher than
the inflation rate that drove President Nixon to impose wage
and price controls in 1971. It's also higher than the rate
that moved the Fed to firm up its credit policy two years
ago.

   Yet hardly anyone besides Fed policy makers, who are paid
to worry about inflation, seems to care. In the latest Wall
Street Journal/NBC poll, inflation ranked well behind the
budget deficit, unemployment and the trade deficit as the
most pressing economic problem of the day.
                                                                                                       

   The survey indicated that most Americans put job security
ahead of conducting a possibly painful all-out war on
inflation. Meanwhile, business groups are generally silent on
the subject, calling instead for lower interest rates. The
president seems more interested in keeping the economy
growing than in breaking the back of inflation. Few in
Congress support a bill to make ending inflation the Fed's
main goal.
                                                                                                       

   Such attitudes are dangerous, Mr. Brimmer claims, because
"it's exactly at times like this that one has to be on guard
against inflation: It's a creeping disease."
   But is this really so? The underlying inflation rate --
calculated by excluding volatile food and energy prices from
the consumer price index -- has been remarkably stable since
1983, fluctuating between 4% and 4.5%, except for a jump to
5% in 1984. Most economists see inflation in the same range
for 1990. On Friday the government said producer prices fell
0.2% last month, but increased 4.4% in the past year.
   "It's almost a straight line -- that's already violated
some economic thinking," says Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia
State University economist considered an authority on
inflation.
   In the past, a little inflation often has led to worse
inflation, with producers charging more and workers demanding
more. Consumers also have fed the spiral by hoarding in
anticipation of further price increases.
                                                                                                       

   But now, the inflation snowball is rolling along without
getting any bigger, perhaps because of adroit monetary
policy, perhaps because global competition restrains price
increases, perhaps because unions are weaker.
                                                                                                       

   So perhaps most Americans are correct not to care about
inflation. After all, so long as the current inflation rate
persists, families with fixed-rate loans can continue paying
the same monthly amounts, even though inflation erodes the
value of the repaid dollars. The same benefit applies for
firms laden with fixed-rate debt, of which there are many.
   "If we had a few years of inflation like we had in 1979,
Campeau would be on easy street," says James Smith, a
University of North Carolina economist. James Tobin, a
Nobel-laureate economist at Yale, reckons that sharply
declining inflation would hurt many borrowers who went into
hock assuming inflation would continue in the 4% to 5% range.
And Daniel Krumm, chairman of Maytag Corp., says, "I don't
endorse 4.5% inflation, but I think it's manageable."
   Still, there are many reasons for concern. Even if
inflation remains unchanged, some economists warn this would
take a toll. "I used to say, let's settle down at 5% and
level out there," says Herbert Stein, a former chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisors. But now, he believes, this
isn't "really a tenable position in the long run," since
"ordinary people don't count on it" and are "going to be
surprised when they settle down for retirement or have to
send their kids to college."
                                                                                                       

   Even at a pace well below that of the early 1980s,
inflation tends to encourage still more borrowing in an
already leveraged economy. It erodes living standards of
those on fixed incomes and of those whose wages don't match
price increases. It distorts prices as economic signals,
making it difficult to distinguish real scarcity from the
overall price spiral. It creates uncertainty, which tends to
drive up interest rates. And it risks a resurgence of
inflationary expectations, with hedge-buying shoppers
anticipating -- as well as helping to initiate -- ever larger
price increases.
                                                                                                       

   Whatever their merits, such considerations aren't
persuading many people at a time when economic growth has
slowed and a quarter of a million factory jobs have been lost
in the past year. Subduing inflation is likely to require
some pain. Still, the Fed says it remains committed to the
goal. But for now at least, it has few allies, and so its
fight will probably be a lonely, difficult undertaking.
