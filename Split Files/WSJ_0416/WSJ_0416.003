   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration eased visa
restrictions on foreigners infected with the AIDS virus, but
showed no signs of moving to end an immigration policy that
AIDS activists say is discriminatory.
   Current immigration rules classify acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, as a contagious disease. The
rules block people infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, from entering the country
unless they get a waiver. A number of AIDS support groups,
medical associations and foreign governments have condemned
the U.S. policy as unnecessarily harsh, and have threatened
to boycott an international AIDS conference scheduled for San
Francisco in June unless the law is changed.

   The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced on
Friday a decision to grant special 10-day visas that will
allow foreigners to attend designated scientific and other
conferences in the U.S. without having to declare on an
immigration form whether they are HIV-positive. Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, the official charged
with selecting the meetings eligible for the 10-day visas,
said that the June AIDS conference and an August conference
on hemophilia in Washington both qualify.
   In 1987, Congress, acting on a proposal by Sen. Jesse
Helms (R., N.C.), added HIV to the list of contagious
diseases to be kept out of the country. However, the federal
Centers for Disease Control, part of HHS, recently
recommended that HIV be removed from the list because it
doesn't represent a public health threat. A bill was recently
introduced by Rep. Roy Rowland (D., Ga.) to allow HHS to do
that.
   AIDS activists have been pressing President Bush and Dr.
Sullivan to support the Rowland bill. But, so far, the
administration, apparently worried about a political backlash
from conservatives, has refused.
   The administration's reaction to pressure from AIDS groups
and even from the government's own National Commission on
AIDS has been characterized by awkwardness and silence.
Earlier this month, the administration flip-flopped when Rep.
Rowland, a doctor, introduced his bill. At first, HHS
officials said the administration opposed the bill. Then,
after meetings involving Dr. Sullivan and his staff, the
department announced that the administration has no position
on the bill. That continues to be the administration's
stance.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), who supports removing HIV
from the list of diseases that restricts entry into the U.S.,
called the new visa procedure "encouraging." But he urged the
administration to "work with Congress to realign U.S.
immigration policy with sound public health principles."
