   WASHINGTON -- Dexter Lehtinen spells trouble for the Bush
administration.
   Since the U.S. attorney in Miami was named to his post on
an interim basis in June 1988, a steady stream of disgruntled
lawyers have left. The departures have raised concerns at the
Justice Department about the management of one of the main
outposts in the federal war on drugs.

   Meanwhile, Mr. Lehtinen's nomination to the prosecutor's
job has sunk into the murky politics of Capitol Hill. Some
observers predict it may never emerge for a Senate vote
because neither Democrats nor Republicans want a public
airing of charges that Mr. Lehtinen physically bullied a
former wife and a former woman friend. Mr. Lehtinen has
denied the allegations.
   Mr. Lehtinen came to national attention in January when
deposed Panamanian ruler Manuel Noriega was brought to Miami
for trial on drug racketeering charges. Mr. Lehtinen
immediately announced that he would supervise the politically
charged prosecution. Just as quickly, questions arose about
Mr. Lehtinen's courtroom skills, his temperament and why he
hadn't ever been formally nominated to the job. Within weeks,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh nudged Mr. Lehtinen off the
Noriega case.
   When he received the interim appointment during the Reagan
administration, the prosecutor had only recently returned to
legal practice after nearly eight years as a state
legislator. Since then, the decorated Vietnam veteran has
built a reputation for shouting fits and public humiliation
of subordinates. A number of prosecutors have left the Miami
office, with at least five experienced lawyers departing in
February alone.
   Former subordinates complain about Mr. Lehtinen's emphasis
on absolute personal loyalty. "You can't think about
disagreeing or questioning anything," says one former
prosecutor. "With Dexter, you're either with him or against
him."
   Mr. Lehtinen, in contrast, cites establishment of a strict
"chain of command" as one of his major accomplishments. He
says the prosecutor turnover rate in Miami has actually
decreased during his tenure. He also claims to have increased
employee productivity and to have brought more drug,
organized crime and public corruption cases than his
predecessors. (Such comparisons are difficult because the
overall size of the office has grown steadily.)
   Mr. Lehtinen says his record has been distorted by
self-interested former employees and the media. "There is no
controversy," he says. "It doesn't exist."
   Top aides to Attorney General Thornburgh have a different
view. They're worried about morale problems in the Miami
office and about domestic violence allegations against Mr.
Lehtinen. Publicly, Mr. Thornburgh's aides say they have "no
problems" with the nomination. But privately they try to
absolve the attorney general of responsibility, insisting the
decision was made at the White House.
   Why would President Bush proceed with this seemingly risky
nomination? For one thing, Mr. Lehtinen has the backing of
Sen. Connie Mack (R., Fla.) and the president's son, Jeb
Bush, who is active in Florida politics. The administration
also wants to show support for Mr. Lehtinen's wife, Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, a conservative GOP congresswoman popular with
Miami's Cuban-American population.
   In addition, the White House is counting on the Senate
tradition of rubber-stamping U.S. attorney nominations,
despite the considerable power the 94 regional federal
prosecutors wield in deploying the government's massive law
enforcement arsenal. In Mr. Lehtinen's case, the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, Joseph Biden, hasn't decided
yet whether to break precedent and hold a public hearing, let
alone lead any opposition. Some observers believe that the
Delaware Democrat, who attempts to keep the peace on a deeply
divided committee, doesn't relish the prospect of a messy
battle over Mr. Lehtinen's private life.
   According to some Washington sources, anxiety on both
sides could produce a compromise: The Judiciary Committee
would sit on the nomination until after Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's
re-election bid in November. If she wins, the White House
would withdraw her husband's nomination and quietly offer him
a position that doesn't require Senate confirmation.
   What would be lost in the process, however, would be a
clear verdict on whether Mr. Lehtinen deserved to be
appointed to the U.S. attorney job in the first place.
