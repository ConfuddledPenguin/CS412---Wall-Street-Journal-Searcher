   BUCHAREST -- A Romanian official responsible for
privatization said he expects resistance to the process from
factory managers unfamiliar with market mechanisms after 43
years of Communist rule.
   A decree of the provisional government legalizing free
enterprise in Romania took effect last month. The government
is seeking joint ventures and other cooperation with foreign
companies to gain experience and access to foreign capital,
said Adrian Severin, state secretary for privatization in the
Economy Ministry.

   But Communist thinking still prevalent in factories could
slow the process of introducing private enterprise and market
mechanisms, Mr. Severin told a news conference.
   "Factory managers say privatization is bad and that they
need a `wise man' to tell them which way to go and what to
produce," Mr. Severin said.
   The government, however, is determined to decentralize the
economy and pass on to a market economy, the official said.
   He said Romanians will have to be educated about the
advantages of a market economy if it is to work.
   "People associate privatization with misery," he said.
"People should understand that privatization is good."
