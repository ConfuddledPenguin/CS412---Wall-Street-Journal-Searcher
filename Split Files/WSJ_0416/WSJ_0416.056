   Cypress Semiconductor Inc., one of Silicon Valley's most
profitable chip-maker start-ups, has resumed an upward profit
surge after a sluggish year-end quarter.
   Cypress expects to report today net income of $8.3
million, or 22 cents a share, for the first quarter ended
April 2, up 16% from $7.1 million, or 19 cents a share, a
year earlier, Cypress President T. J. Rodgers said in an
interview. Cypress's chip sales picked up across the board
during the quarter, following a drop in orders late last year
caused when personal-computer makers cut back production, he
said.

   The San Jose, Calif., company's rebound mirrors an
improvement in the chip industry's leading indicator last
week and could augur better times for semiconductor makers.
"We've just broken out of a stagnant period," said Mr.
Rodgers. After cutting inventories, "a lot of customers are
starting to buy again," he said.
   Cypress's first-quarter sales were $52.8 million, up 14%
from $46.2 million in the year-earlier quarter, Mr. Rodgers
said. Much of the rebound came from chip distributors, who
sell chips to smaller companies, he said, while sales to
personal-computer companies remained sluggish.
   Cypress has made its name -- and its profits -- by
targeting niches that Japanese chip juggernauts have ignored
as too small, and by making a large variety of
high-performance chips for those niches. The company now
makes 171 different chips, and expects to expand its
offerings to 210 by year end.
   Many of those chips have been less susceptible to the chip
slump that plagued other semiconductor companies in 1989. And
they have allowed Cypress to maintain high profit margins
matched by few other chip makers. Often cited as a
quintessential entrepreneurial company, Cypress had an
operating profit ratio of 21% of sales for its first quarter,
and gross margins of 61%. "The reason we're financially
stable is that we have a lot of eggs, with no single
vulnerable point," he said.
   Cypress said it expects to add at least one major product
line this year, and is exploring different ways of entering
the market for so-called digital-signal processor chips, used
in hi-fi equipment and many other products. The company also
said it will enter the fast-growing market for
microcontrollers -- "brain" chips used to command machines
such as printers and disk drives -- with a new chip that uses
Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Sparc architecture.
   Cypress expects profit to continue to grow at a healthy,
if not torrid, pace. The company had orders of $54 million in
the first quarter, up from $41 million in the immediately
prior quarter, when bookings fell 33%. For chip companies,
increased bookings in one quarter usually presage increased
sales in the following quarters.
   What's more, certain chips that weren't in demand late
last year suddenly are in heavy demand, Mr. Rodgers said.
Customers placing orders for high-density versions of chips
called static random-access memories, for example, must wait
13 weeks for delivery, he said. Late last year, delivery of
the chips was almost immediate.
   For the quarter ending July 2, Mr. Rodgers said he was
"comfortable" with analysts' estimates that the company would
post net of about $8.8 million, or 22 cents to 23 cents a
share, compared with $7.6 million, or 20 cents a share, in
the year-earlier quarter. He said he was also comfortable
with analysts' estimates of between $55 million and $57
million in revenue for the quarter.
   Contributing to increased profits this year will be sales
overseas, Mr. Rodgers said. Several big companies in Japan,
where Cypress did 5% of its sales last year, plan to use
Cypress chips in new mainframe computers and supercomputers.
Those chip sales and others will push Japanese sales to 7.5%
of Cypress's total sales for 1990, he said.
   Cypress ended the first quarter with $95.5 million in cash
and equivalents. About $25 million will go toward the
company's plan to buy back two million of its shares to apply
toward employee incentive programs, he said.
