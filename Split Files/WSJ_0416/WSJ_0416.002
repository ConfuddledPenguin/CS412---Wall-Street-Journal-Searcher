   LYNBROOK, N.Y. -- First Central Financial Corp., which in
February estimated that fourth-quarter net income rose more
than 9%, reported a $197,000 loss for the period, after
adding $1.8 million to reserves for incurred but unreported
losses on underwriting.
   The insurance-holding company said its reserves against
possible losses in its general liability and worker's
compensation insurance had been insufficient, and the
additional provision brought reserves to levels required by
state regulators.

   The loss equaled three cents a share, compared with net
income of $914,000, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The loss brought down 1989 net income 23% to $2.4 million,
or 40 cents a share, from 1988's $3.1 million, or 50 cents a
share. First Central had estimated that full-year earnings
rose 20%. Average shares outstanding for 1989 fell 4% to 5.9
million; First Central has been buying back its shares.
   Chairman Martin J. Simon stood by his projected percentage
increases in per-share earnings made two months ago. He
called the provision "a bullish move. We strengthened our
loss reserves and saved $500,000 in taxes. . . . We're very
strong financially. We're climbing a mountain. We decided to
take a breath and resume our climb."
   The company is allowed to write insurance equal to three
times its net worth, or assets less liabilities, and the firm
is currently writing a "very conservative" 1.2 times net
worth, Mr. Simon said.
   Two months ago, Mr. Simon projected that First Central's
per-share earnings would rise as much as 25% for 1990 and
then as much as 17% for 1991.
   Mr. Simon said the company won't make a public offering as
it had contemplated. "In these uncertain times, and because I
thought it would be too much of a dilution" of current
holders' equity, First Central dropped the idea of a public
offering, Mr. Simon said.
