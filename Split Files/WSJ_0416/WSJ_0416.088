   It's high time "Mobil Masterpiece Theatre" changed its
name. Even when the producers of this long-lived series adapt
a literary work nowadays, they never pick a masterpiece.
Since most of the presentations are created from scratch, and
helped along by Mobil's scratch, a more accurate title would
be, "Subsidized British Imports."
   Having said that, I now can turn to more important
matters, like "Traffik," the International Emmy Award-winning
miniseries about the heroin trade that begins with a special
two-hour episode this Sunday (April 22, 9-11 p.m. EDT) and
continues through May 20 (9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS; check local
listings). Filmed on location in the mountains of northern
Pakistan, Karachi, Hamburg and London, this five-part
dramatic series is an impressive production with lofty
ambitions, not all of them realized.

   According to writer Simon Moore, "Traffik" tries to paint
a picture of the drug trade that is both morally nuanced and
sweeping in scope. "What we wanted to do," he said in a
recent interview, is "not show it in the usual
black-and-white morality, but . . . force people to think a
little more closely about it as a world industry."
   On the first point, moral nuance, the film succeeds. It
has some pure villains, such as Tariq Butt (Talat Hussain),
the Karachi kingpin whose style of "doing business" is both
sadistic and tyrannical. And it has some pure victims, such
as the wife of the poppy farmer Fazal, whose life is merely a
bargaining chip in Butt's game. But the majority of the
characters occupy the shadowlands between honor,
self-interest and survival.
   Take Fazal (Jamal Shah), the peasant who loses his poppy
fields in a government raid. One-dimensionally noble at
first, he develops into a complex mix of desperation,
calculation and pride. Similar ingredients make up the
character of Helen (Lindsay Duncan), the wife of Butt's
German connection, who eventually decides, after the arrest
of her husband, to carry on with the trade. For her, greed is
mingled with an iron will and a fierce desire to protect her
children.
   "Traffik" also succeeds in spanning the international
dimension of the drug problem in a way that is striking, and
unsettling, to Americans who think of it in terms of the U.S.
and Latin America. And the globe-spanning is done with
impressive technical skill, switching between settings
without the usual "location shots." The film really does
achieve director Alastair Reid's stated goal of letting the
viewer know instantly where he is, "even if all he can see is
an ashtray."
   Mr. Moore also expressed the hope that "Traffik" would
avoid cliches: "Cop on the trail of the drug scam or junkies
in the doorway is the typical point of view taken by
television," he states in a recent press release. "Neither,
it seemed to me, particularly illuminated anything about the
subject." He has a point: Most anti-drug films do focus on
cops, scams and junkies. But why is that? And does "Traffik"
really improve on the formula?
   The answer to the first question has to do with the
ambivalence most of us feel toward authority. We expect
authority to deliver us from evil, so we favor cops who are
tough on pushers. But we also distrust authority, so we favor
cops who rebel against corrupt or timid superiors. In fact,
"Traffik" gives us just such a cop in Ulli (Fritz
Muller-Scherz), the shrewd, lummox of a Hamburg narc who
bends the rules trying to snare Helen.
   But "Traffik" also departs from the cop formula, notably
in its portrayal of Jack Lithgow (Bill Paterson), a British
cabinet minister whose efforts to block the supply of heroin
from Pakistan are complicated by his discovery that his
daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) has become hooked on heroin
while living the fast life at Cambridge.
   Jack's first reaction to Caroline's addiction will be
immediately applauded by those Americans who advocate "tough
love" as the only effective form of parental intervention.
Unlike Jack's wife, whose timorous efforts to placate her
daughter have only facilitated the latter's habit, Jack
forces Caroline into immediate withdrawal, imposes stern
discipline and finally commits her to a private clinic.
   If Mr. Moore thinks "tough love" is a new theme, then let
me recommend several recent made-for-TV movies that have
taught us Yanks to root for the strict parent who refuses to
be conned by a pathetic son or daughter whose will has been
eroded by drugs. By now, most of us pay lip service, at
least, to the notion that it is not always smart to
"understand" our children the way Jack's wife "understands"
Caroline.
   But as the story unfolds, we realize we are not supposed
to be rooting for Jack. After all, he's not just a concerned
father, he's also a government official whose workaholic life
style and bureaucratic ambition have led him to neglect both
his wife and his daughter. From this angle, it appears that
Caroline's addiction is Jack's fault, and that his drastic
actions are nothing but the clumsy efforts of an insensitive
father to make up for lost time.
   What should Jack do? Should he go to Pakistan to fight the
supply of drugs, or should he stay home and fight the demand
for drugs as exemplified by Caroline? It's too bad this
conflict receives so much emphasis in "Traffik," because it
confuses two logically separate questions: the public-policy
question of whether government should focus on supply or
demand, and the personal question of whether Jack should save
his career or his family.
   In my opinion, the makers of "Traffik" succumb to this
confusion because they, too, feel ambivalent toward
authority. They sympathize with Jack's attempt to control his
lying, stealing, suffering child. But they cannot abide the
thought of a government crackdown on addicts in general.
Perforce, they make Jack a rebel who refuses to go along with
half-measures and who blames "society" for driving people to
drugs -- a pseudo-resolution that is, to say the least,
unworthy of the rest of this fine film.
