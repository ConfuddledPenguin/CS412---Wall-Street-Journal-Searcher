   NEW YORK -- Venezuela expects within the next few months
to have completed steps to facilitate foreign investment in
its oil and petrochemical industries, said Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. president, Andres Sosa Pietri.
   At a luncheon of the Venezuelan American Association in
New York last week, Mr. Sosa Pietri said the state oil
company is seeking to encourage foreign investment in an
effort to triple capacity in the next five years.

   The government is sponsoring a bill in Congress to permit
foreign involvement in a proposed $3.5 billion liquefied
natural gas project, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. That project,
which is expected to require the development of offshore gas
reserves, would be an important new outlet for Venezuela's
106 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
   Mr. Sosa Pietri said that five or six foreign companies
have made firm offers to join a Petroleos affiliate in the
project. A feasibility study is expected to be completed by
the end of May.
   Foreign participation in the Venezuelan oil industry has
been strictly limited since its nationalization during
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez's previous
administration. But after his re-election in late 1988,
President Perez embarked on an economic overhaul package
intended to reduce the country's heavy foreign debt and
stimulate the local economy. That program has included
encouraging private sector participation in key industries,
allowing the market to set the exchange rate for the bolivar,
and lifting price controls on many goods.
   The encouragement of foreign investment in the energy
sector is still controversial in Venezuela, and some analysts
have expressed doubts that Congress would move proposals
through as fast as Mr. Sosa Pietri thinks they will.
   High tax rates are one obstacle to foreign investment that
the government is hoping to alleviate. Corporations are
generally taxed at a rate of 48%, while Petroleos struggles
under a composite tax burden of 82%. He said Congress is
considering legislation that would lower the corporate tax
rate to 35%.
   To help with plans to increase crude oil production
capacity, Venezuela also is considering revising rules that
prevent foreign participation in the upstream sector of
Venezuela's oil industry, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. New rules
could come by mid-May, he said.
   He didn't specify how the rules would be revised other
than to say that they wouldn't include concessions, which
aren't allowed by the constitution. However, he said
Petroleos hopes for "joint ventures from exploration all the
way through downstream."
   Venezuela also plans to expand its production of
orimulsion, a bitumen and water blend that competes with coal
at a price of about $5 a barrel, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. "A
series of agreements" will put exports at 100,000 barrels a
day by 1992, he said. That blend, developed by Petroleos and
the British Petroleum Co., will enable Venezuela to take
advantage of its 230 billion barrels of bitumen reserves in
Orinoco.
   Regarding Petroleos itself, he said that there is a
reorganization under way to "enhance the role of Petroleos as
a holding company, not an operating company," and to
strengthen the role of the affiliates.
   The Petroleos chief took pains to emphasize that Venezuela
sees its economic future tied to the health of the economies
of the U.S., Europe, and Japan, its main markets. Price
shocks aren't in Venezuela's interest, he stressed. "We
believe in price increases . . . that go along with world
inflation levels."
   Mr. Sosa Pietri said he didn't think that Venezuela's
membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would hamstring its plans to increase crude-oil
production capacity beyond its present OPEC quota. As demand
outstrips OPEC production capacity, the need for quotas will
disappear, Mr. Sosa Pietri said.
   Mr. Sosa Pietri, a Harvard University Law School graduate
who spent his career as a self-described "entrepreneur in
medium-sized companies" dealing with international markets,
also addressed the outcry accompanying his appointment.
President Perez was criticized for appointing an outsider to
the company, but Mr. Sosa Pietri said it reflected the
president's commitment to encouraging the private sector and
maintaining Petroleos as a commercial entity.
