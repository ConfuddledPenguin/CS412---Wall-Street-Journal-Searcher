   MEXICO CITY -- Unemployment in Mexico declined in 1989,
the government news agency Notimex said.
   Open unemployment dropped to 2.4% for the first 11 months
of 1989, half a point below the December 1988 level, the
agency said, citing a Budget and Planning Department report.

   The figure is considered conservative. Private economists
estimate combined unemployment and underemployment at around
40%.
   The biggest declines in joblessness were in the northern
cities of Monterrey and Torreon, along with Mexico City,
Merida, Orizaba and Puebla.
