   Wells, Rich, Greene, far behind in Madison Avenue's race
to develop a global presence, signed an agreement with Boulet
Dru Dupuy Petit in which the French agency will take a 40%
ownership in Wells Rich.
   At the same time, Wells Rich said founder Mary Wells
Lawrence, 61 years old, is passing the reins of the company
to Kenneth Olshan, currently chairman of Wells, Rich,
Greene/Worldwide. Mr. Olshan was named chairman and chief
executive officer of Wells Rich.

   The arrangement with BDDP calls for members of Wells
Rich's management team to hold a minority stake -- its size
hasn't been determined -- in BDDP. Mr. Olshan, 56, and a few
other Wells Rich executives will serve on a BDDP-Wells Rich
executive committee.
   At a news conference at Wells Rich's Manhattan
headquarters, executives of both closely held agencies
described the association as a "perfect fit." BDDP, which
holds minority interests in agencies in Europe and the
Pacific Rim, has been looking for a North American partner;
Wells Rich, which has struggled with a number of affiliate
relationships overseas, badly needs a presence in the markets
in which BDDP is represented. Terms of the transaction
weren't disclosed.
   The agreement helps BDDP's efforts to build an
international network. BDDP, which is headed by Jean-Claude
Boulet, last year had unsuccessful discussions with WCRS
about purchasing its ad business. It also bid unsuccessfully
for London's Boase Massimi Pollitt.
   In recent years, most major agencies have aggressively
pursued international links to compete for the business of
multinational clients. For example, Foote, Cone &amp; Belding
Communications recently forged an alliance with France's
Publicis.
   Wells Rich said the BDDP affiliation will allow it to
continue to focus on its ad business in the U.S., but also
offer it an overseas network for its clients. Wells Rich,
which has billings of about $860 million, creates ads for
IBM, Hertz and Ford, among others.
   "We believe this is an excellent solution for us, for BDDP
and for our clients," Mr. Olshan said. "We share the same
values, goals and philosophies of our clients." He said the
initial reaction from clients has been positive and that
there aren't any major conflicts between the two agencies.
   BDDP Group, whose major European clients include Polaroid
and McDonald's, has billings of $1.4 billion.
   Wells Rich's entry into the international arena, however,
comes as Mrs. Lawrence is pulling herself further out of the
day-to-day operations of the agency. In recent years, she has
attended some new business pitches and various other events
but has spent a greater portion of her time at a house in
France.
   "There's simply no question that Ken is the leader for
Wells, Rich, Greene in the future," Mrs. Lawrence said. She
added: "This doesn't mean I'm going to the moon," and said
that she will continue to be in contact with Wells Rich
executives and will tend to major problems as they arise.
   Mrs. Lawrence said she will benefit from the sale of some
Wells Rich stock, although she declined to say how much. She
said she would keep a "substantial investment" in Wells Rich,
and would invest some of her stock in BDDP. But she said she
probably will sell all of her shares within five years or so.
   A legendary figure on Madison Avenue, Mrs. Lawrence
started in the business writing ads for a Youngstown, Ohio,
department store. After working at several New York agencies,
she helped found Wells Rich in 1966, and it soon became
highly regarded for its quirky creative work on such accounts
as Braniff Airlines, Alka-Seltzer and Benson &amp; Hedges
cigarettes. In the past few years, however, the shop's
reputation has sagged somewhat. It has suffered the loss of
many accounts, including a number of Procter &amp; Gamble brands.
   But some industry observers believe Wells Rich may be on
its way back up. The shop's recent new-business record is
strong, having picked up Hertz, Sheraton and Continental
Airlines. Wells Rich first made its reputation with an
airline account, some executives argue, and say it might use
Continental as a springboard back to fame.
   Although Mrs. Lawrence won't spend as much time at the
agency, she leaves behind three children on the staff: Jim,
an executive vice president, who is returning to New York
from the Detroit office to head up the Continental account;
Kathryn, a senior vice president, who oversees financial
planning; and State, a senior vice president who heads up the
P&amp;G Pringle's account.

   Hill Holliday Gets Reebok
                                                                                                       

   Reebok International selected Hill, Holliday, Connors,
Cosmopulos, Boston, as the agency for its $40 million
domestic ad account, industry executives said.
   Reebok put the account, which had been handled by
Chiat/Day/Mojo, up for review in January. Chiat Day declined
to participate in the review and resigned the account. But
later, after a management shake-up at Reebok, Chiat Day
joined the review. Some industry observers had expected Chiat
Day to emerge as the victor and continue to service the
business.
   Neither Reebok nor the agencies could be reached for
comment.
   Chiat Day is expected to continue to handle Reebok's
international advertising from its London office.
   The other finalists in the review were DDB Needham; Waring
& LaRosa; and Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver.

   SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising resigned
Best Foods' estimated $10 million Mazola account and its
position as Best Foods' media buying agency of record. In the
past 14 months, Saatchi has lost Best Foods' Skippy and
Hellmann's brands to BBDO. Best Foods, a unit of CPC
International, said it didn't have any immediate plans for
the brand or the media assignment.
                                                                                                       

   NEW PRODUCT: Thomas J. Lipton, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.,
named Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a WPP Group agency, to handle a new
product assignment. Billings weren't disclosed.
                                                                                                       

   YOUNG &amp; RUBICAM: Young &amp; Rubicam said it consolidated its
three agency groups in New York into a single unit. John
Glorieux and Jane Brite were named the office's new general
manager and associate general manager, respectively. Along
with George Guimaraes, the executives had been the general
managers of the three groups. Mr. Guimaraes is to be named to
a management post with Y&amp;R outside of New York.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: Telerate Systems, New York, a unit of Dow
Jones &amp; Co., awarded its $1.1 million account to
Buckley/DeCerchio.
