   Many people think that putting money into an escrow bank
account guarded by an attorney is as safe as putting it into
their own bank vault. They couldn't be more wrong.
   In recent years, many attorneys and other trustees of
escrow accounts -- mainly for real-estate transactions and
legal settlements -- have used the money to gamble, buy drugs
and enrich their own life styles. Clients find themselves
victims of the very people they had hired to protect
themselves and their assets.

   Now some state bar associations are trying to provide
safeguards for clients. Bar groups in New York, New Jersey
and other states have initiated programs to require attorneys
to keep stricter records of escrow accounts. Groups in a few
states, including New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, also
have begun random audits of escrow accounts to ensure that
the attorneys are keeping clients' funds separated from their
own.
   Nobody seems to know the total amount of money in escrow
accounts, or the total amount of escrow fraud, but
authorities agree it's a growing problem. "There's greater
detection, so we know more about it {now}, but there's no
question the problem is increasing very rapidly," says Hal R.
Lieberman, chief counsel for a disciplinary committee of the
appellate division of the New York State Supreme Court. John
Moscow, deputy chief of the Manhattan District Attorney's
investigations division, adds, "An escrow account is one of
the biggest avenues for theft in the nation."
   Many families and businesses give big sums of money to
lawyers and other professionals -- such as accountants and
real-estate brokers -- to hold in bank escrow accounts. After
sales of homes or court settlements following accidents, the
proceeds are normally sent to the client's attorney, who
places the money in an escrow account. With the client's
permission, the attorney takes his fee from the account. He
then is supposed to forward the rest to his client.
   It doesn't always work out that way. This month, former
lawyer Jack B. Solerwitz pleaded guilty to grand larceny in
Nassau County (N.Y.) Court. According to court officials, he
admitted taking $1.8 million from escrow and other accounts
of many clients to live a flamboyant life style that included
luxury automobiles. Mr. Solerwitz, who was disbarred in
February, listed debts of $4 million in a personal-bankruptcy
filing. He faces 10 to 30 years in prison and is free on
$250,000 bail.
   In another case, Ross Nichols of Pawling, N.Y., began
worrying three years ago because he and other heirs to a
$600,000 estate of which he was also executor weren't
receiving checks from an attorney's escrow bank account.
(About $315,000 of the estate had already been distributed.)
   So he phoned the lawyer, Richard Nahley, who was also a
probate-court judge in Danbury, Conn. According to Mr.
Nichols, Mr. Nahley said he had misplaced checks from the
estate that were supposed to be mailed to a bank for the
heirs to draw on. He said the checks would be promptly
deposited. They weren't.
   Mr. Nichols and Mr. Nahley were old friends. Mr. Nahley
even invited Mr. Nichols and his wife, Beverly, as his guests
to see the Broadway show "Les Miserables." "Why, he even took
us to an expensive French restaurant and bought an $88 bottle
of wine," Mrs. Nichols says.
   A month later, Mr. Nahley was found dead in a Washington,
D.C., motel, where he had strangled himself with a bathrobe
belt, according to law-enforcement authorities. Investigators
determined that Mr. Nahley had been defrauding dozens of his
clients of close to $5 million from their escrow funds, which
he used to live the high life and travel to Europe on the
Concorde for frequent vacations.
   In the wake of the Nahley case, the Connecticut bar late
last year began requiring the state's 14,000 lawyers to keep
their clients' escrow accounts in certain selected banks.
These banks have agreed that if an attorney's escrow account
kept in safekeeping for his client is overdrawn, the bank
must immediately inform a grievance panel of the state bar
association.
   "If these steps had been taken years ago, the problems
with Mr. Nahley would never have occurred," says John W.
Hogan Jr., a New Haven attorney who is chairman of the
Connecticut bar's client-security fund.
   That fund, like those in most other states, pays full or
partial restitution to clients defrauded by attorneys. But
some such state funds -- which are supported by lawyers' dues
or voluntary contributions -- have been strapped because of a
surge in claims. In Illinois, the voluntary fund has dropped
to less than $100,000 from more than $400,000 four years ago.
   The Illinois bar has 153 claims totaling $2.2 million
pending against its client-security fund for money improperly
taken by lawyers in the state from escrow and other clients'
accounts. "The bar used to be a gentlemen's club, but some
members just aren't gentlemen anymore," says Willis Tribler,
a Chicago lawyer who is a director of the state's
client-security fund.
   Mr. Tribler says a class-action suit is pending against
one disbarred Illinois lawyer -- now driving a cab -- who
allegedly took money from dozens of illegal aliens. The
aliens had planned to use the money to file for citizenship
during a period of amnesty from immigration laws. He recalls
another Illinois lawyer who allegedly stole more than
$100,000 from escrow accounts of people who had received
accident-claim settlements from insurance companies.
   Some attorneys say holding large amounts of clients' money
in escrow creates a psychological strain. Steven Winston, who
was suspended as a lawyer by a New York court several years
ago after he improperly used a client's funds, says in an
interview that he "sometimes felt that escrow money of
clients was my money." He says he took $12,500 of a client's
escrow bank account from selling a home to use for drugs.
   "I became addicted to cocaine, and I needed a lot of
money," says Mr. Winston, who last August applied for
readmission to the bar after undergoing rehabilitation from
drug addiction. (The application is still pending.) "Now that
my mind is a lot clearer, I know that the escrow account
belongs to the clients," says Mr. Winston, who has paid the
$12,500 back to the client.
   Policing the entire bar to make sure that clients' escrow
accounts held by attorneys are safe is a gargantuan task. But
if escrow accounts are overseen by individuals other than
attorneys, even if they're professionals, it is almost
impossible.
   In February, a New York certified public accountant named
Steven Delit allegedly stole more than $1.7 million he was
supposed to have put in escrow funds from 70 tenants living
in the same Manhattan apartment building as Mr. Delit.
Tenants unhappy with the building's service had given the
money to Mr. Delit for safekeeping in a rent strike.
   But Mr. Delit -- now subject to arrest under a felony
warrant for first-degree grand larceny -- allegedly used the
money to open a brokerage account and to gamble at 10 casinos
in Atlantic City, where he lost thousands of dollars playing
blackjack in an attempt to shore up a failing practice. He
also used the money to take trips to Club Med in Tahiti and
to open up a pizza restaurant, says Mr. Moscow of the
Manhattan District Attorney's office.
   Mr. Moscow says attorneys for the tenants and the landlord
both failed to check monthly on the escrow account overseen
by Mr. Delit. Mr. Moscow says Mr. Delit has fled New York and
can't be found by law-enforcement agencies.
   Robert Anderson, attorney for the tenant group, says it
wasn't his responsibility to check the escrow account. "Mr.
Delit was a CPA, and the tenants trusted him," Mr. Anderson
says.
   Mr. Moscow says an escrow account overseen by someone who
can withdraw money with only his signature and without
periodic checking by an outside party is "an open invitation
to theft."
