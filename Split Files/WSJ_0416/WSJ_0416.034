   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- The two European businessmen who head
Verit Industries, Malcolm Stockdale and John Carway, are
presenting themselves as financial angels to small, publicly
traded companies in need. But candidates for help might be
wondering whether their benefactors are all that angelic.
   Consider, for example, that Mr. Carway has a criminal
record in both Ireland and England, that a Verit auditor
dropped the account last year, challenging numerous Verit
practices, and that Messrs. Stockdale and Carway's
acquisitions are bewilderingly complex arrangements,
sometimes involving companies in the British Isle of Man tax
haven.

   Consider too that one small shareholder claims to be
trying to get a federal investigation started into what he
alleges is a stock manipulation effort by the pair, designed
to siphon off the assets of companies they acquire.
   Nonsense, Mr. Carway says of the last issue. He says the
holder, Mark Anderson, a Los Angeles real estate developer,
made up the claims and used them in an attempt to extort
$500,000 from Verit. Mr. Anderson denies the allegation. No
suits have been filed.
   As for the criminal record, Mr. Carway disclosed it in
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission when he
acquired a 38% interest in Verit and became its president
last November. The 44-year-old Irishman claims he was a
victim of circumstances in both cases. He was given two
separate, one-year suspended sentences in 1985 after pleading
guilty to check fraud and to marijuana possession. The
bad-check conviction, he says, resulted from a 1978 Irish
bank strike that left him unaware of an incoming check that
had bounced. He says he has never used marijuana, but merely
was at a friend's London house during a raid.
   Several U.S. companies have jumped at the Stockdale-Carway
offers of help, including Iroquois Brands Ltd., Emerald Homes
Limited Partnership and Verit itself, which the two men have
begun using as an umbrella for all their acquisitions.
   The latest of the small, lightly traded public companies
to enter into a complicated transaction with Messrs.
Stockdale and Carway is American Toxxic Control Inc., based
in Whittier, Calif. Verit, which recently moved to Phoenix
from Sun Valley, Calif., announced last week that an
80%-owned Verit subsidiary had agreed in principle to merge
with American Toxxic in an exchange for stock of the Verit
unit. The unit, LaPointe Industries Inc., recently emerged
from the protection of Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code, reorganized as a shell company.
   Louis Purmort, American Toxxic's chairman and holder of
25% of its stock, says Verit has offered to help his company
restructure about $4 million of debt and gain a listing on
the American Stock Exchange. Verit will end up holding about
50% of the stock of a new American Toxxic, after the merged
concern changes its name back from LaPointe.
   "We'd been searching for somebody that had enough money to
help us with our acquisition program," Mr. Purmort says.
American Toxxic does about $25 million of business annually
treating industrial wastes. He says he was told of Mr.
Carway's record but isn't troubled, because he has been
impressed by the business accomplishments of Messrs.
Stockdale and Carway for more than a year.
   Mr. Carway says that until last November, his record kept
him in the shadows in his relationship with Mr. Stockdale.
Mr. Carway acquired Paradene Ltd., the Isle of Man company
that had controlled Verit for a year, because he says he "was
just tired of all this bloody flak" about the 1985
convictions, and asked himself, "Why should I have to hide
behind the door?" Recent Verit filings show he already had
been operating Wellsdene Ltd., an Isle of Man company that
Verit paid $320,000 for consulting work and, Verit's auditors
say, had agreed to be paid $1 million more.
   Mr. Carway says the Verit plan has been to acquire
companies in the construction, real estate and
waste-treatment industries and develop their operations.
   It was through Mr. Stockdale, Verit's 45-year-old chairman
and chief executive officer, that Verit gained control of
Iroquois from two other Isle of Man companies this year. Mr.
Stockdale is listed as "consultant and investment adviser" to
Hybrid Investments Ltd. and Meryl Investments Ltd., which
sold Verit their combined 35% stake.
   Mr. Stockdale, whose background is in the British mining
and construction industries, bought a majority interest in
Iroquois in 1988 from then Chairman Terence Fox, who had had
highly publicized problems related to charges of cocaine
possession, which eventually were dropped. Mr. Stockdale sold
Iroquois's pharmaceutical and vitamin businesses and merged
the company with Bio International Inc., a Utah shell he had
used to make all-stock acquisitions of some European concerns
involved in mining and construction equipment. Hybrid and
Meryl, which had sold Bio some of the operations, thus ended
up with Iroquois stock in the merger.
   "It's quite confusing," concedes Mr. Carway, who began his
career selling advertising in Europe. His principal residence
is a 400-year-old estate in County Clare, Ireland, but he has
been living lately in Phoenix.
   Questions of financial disclosure involving the tangle of
corporate entities resulted in a split between Verit and
Touche Ross &amp; Co., which quit the account days after Messrs.
Carway and Stockdale were named top officers. In its SEC
filing at the time, Verit said it hadn't disagreed with its
auditors, now part of Deloitte &amp; Touche. But in a three-page
letter to the SEC, Deloitte took issue with the Verit filing,
specifically questioning what it said could be inadequate
disclosure of consulting fees to pay Mr. Carway's Wellsdene,
and possible miscalculations on Verit's balance sheet.
   Verit, which says the SEC is studying the auditor dispute,
claimed in a later filing that it hadn't done anything wrong
and that there was a "personality conflict" with the auditor.
The SEC won't comment.
   The European activities of Messrs. Carway and Stockdale,
notably at the English conglomerate Eagle Trust PLC, were no
less complex and contentious. Last May, Mr. Stockdale's
Iroquois agreed to buy 13.1% of Eagle for $34.3 million. Mr.
Carway claims Iroquois backed out a few weeks later when it
found "materially false" representations in Eagle's books.
Legal actions filed in Britain allege that Mr. Stockdale, who
briefly was Eagle chairman, reneged on the deal.
   After taking control of Verit late last year, Messrs.
Carway and Stockdale soon entered the battered Arizona real
estate market through Emerald, Mr. Carway says, because "We
think we can get financing and build up the company." He says
other acquisitions are planned.
   So far, Verit has grown by issuing huge amounts of
convertible preferred. For example, it announced plans last
month to issue preferred that converts into 6.6 million
common shares in exchange for Emerald's California and Texas
divisions. Verit has 759,853 common shares outstanding. In
American Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday, Verit
shares closed at $3.625, down 12.5 cents.
