   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Some would argue the
high-risk Vancouver Stock Exchange is dominated by two
things: gold exploration and "The Pez."
   Right now, the outlook for gold plays is upbeat, as dozens
of fledgling exchange-listed outfits gear up for spring
drilling programs on the heels of a big discovery last year.
But times aren't so rosy for Murray "The Pez" Pezim, the
flamboyant 69-year-old stock promoter whose name is
synonymous with Vancouver's venture capital market, which has
in recent years been plagued by stock scandals and bad press.

   Tomorrow, Mr. Pezim, chairman of Vancouver's Prime
Resources Group Inc., is to appear with two associates before
British Columbia securities regulators, to face allegations
that they violated insider trading rules.
   Among other things, British Columbia superintendent of
brokers Wade Nesmith alleged Mr. Pezim, along with Prime
chief executive officer John Ivany and senior vice president
Lawrence Page, engineered several share transactions last
summer between Prime's predecessor and Calpine Resources
Corp., without properly disclosing drilling results from
Calpine's 50%-owned Eskay Creek gold project, in northwest
British Columbia.
   Messrs. Pezim, Ivany, and Page, who also served as Calpine
directors or officers before the companies merged last week,
vehemently deny the charges.
   The purchases allowed Prime to buy effective control of
Calpine at 3.70 Canadian dollars (US$3.19) a share or less,
well below Calpine's peak price of more than C$9 in
September, which it reached after key drilling results were
disclosed. Calpine's shares subsequently settled in the C$6
range, prior to last week's merger.
   If found in violation of stock market rules, Mr. Pezim
could lose his trading rights and be barred from acting as an
officer or director of any company listed on the Vancouver
exchange, including the 50 or so companies in which Prime,
his flagship, has an interest.
   Effectively, The Pez could be out of action just as
seasonal exploration activity picks up -- and, with it, the
need for financing dollars and promoters.
   "The hearing could not have come at a worse time for the
market, especially Eskay Creek," says John Woods, editor of
Stockwatch, a news service that tracks stocks on the
Vancouver exchange. "If Mr. Pezim's energy is going to be
diverted fending off regulatory actions stemming from actions
last year," he says, "that will tie him up this year, and it
puts a cloud of confusion over Eskay Creek."
   Brokers say Mr. Pezim's regulatory dust-up already has
shrunk trading volumes on the Vancouver exchange, where the
Prime group generated about 19% of all activity during the
last half of 1989, according to Gregory Walsh, an attorney
for the superintendent of brokers.
   Daily volume, which set a 12-month high of 25.6 million
shares March 30 -- the same day the allegations against Mr.
Pezim were disclosed -- has since faded, averaging 14 million
shares a day last week.
   "Investors always do one thing when they're concerned,
whether it's in Toronto, New York, or Vancouver. They pull
back," says David Levi, of C.M. Oliver &amp; Co., a local
brokerage firm. "Murray has got a very high profile.
Everybody is just waiting to see what happens" at the
hearings, he says.
   Mr. Pezim has lashed out at Mr. Nesmith, the regulator,
who made the allegations after a protracted, six-month
investigation. "Would you like to be charged with rape and
found innocent?" the scrappy Mr. Pezim asked reporters after
the charges were made. "If he (Mr. Nesmith) wants to make
this a public affair, he's going to get it."
   Mr. Nesmith says he only wants a full public hearing of
the charges, at which the evidence "will speak for itself."
   Since he gave up life as a butcher to sell stocks four
decades ago, Mr. Pezim has had more ups and downs than a
weatherman. He was riding a wave of good news last August,
when he wound up on the winning side of an eight-year legal
battle over ownership of the huge Page-Williams gold mine in
Ontario.
   Mr. Pezim lost control of the company that owned the mine
in 1984, when he was forced to sell part of his stake to Ned
Goodman, who became chairman of what is now Toronto's Corona
Corp. Page-Williams, at Hemlo, Ontario, has helped Corona
become one of North America's biggest gold producers. It's
also Prime's largest holder, with a 28.1% undiluted stake.
Mr. Pezim owned 12% last fall, though his current stake isn't
clear.
   Mr. Pezim promptly scored a second big hit in August, when
Calpine announced impressive drilling results at Eskay Creek.
News of the find sent trading volumes soaring to record
heights on the beleaguered Vancouver exchange.
   The resurgent activity was led by Calpine and Prime,
followed by a flotilla of Prime-linked stocks, including some
with property near Eskay Creek.
   Mr. Pezim is generally admired among Vancouver's brokers,
who rely on him to stir up investor interest. His knack for
finding gold has also helped dull memories of his many flops,
such as Pezzaz greeting cards, which contained audiocassette
messages from celebrities, or another venture that made
monogrammed apples.
   Mr. Pezim isn't one to shrink from adulation.
   "I'm the greatest," a buoyant Mr. Pezim told reporters
back in September, after cementing his rising celebrity
status by bailing out Vancouver's troubled pro football team.
   The mood appears to have changed, for both Mr. Pezim and
his favorite market, however. Stockwatch's Mr. Woods says
companies linked to the Eskay Creek area will have trouble
raising new equity, as long as the hearings last and Mr.
Pezim's status is unclear. Mr. Nesmith figures the hearings
may last a couple of weeks, though he won't say how long it
could take to render a decision.
   "It's a double-edged sword, unfortunately," says Frank
Giustra, of Yorkton-Continental Securities Inc. "From an
enforcement and credibility point of view, the hearings are a
positive move" for the exchange, he says, which is trying to
clean up its image. "But from the point of view of what it
does to the volumes of Eskay Creek stocks, it's obviously a
negative."
   Though things look dicey for the moment for Mr. Pezim, Mr.
Woods says the resilient Pez can't be counted out.
   "According to (Mr.) Pezim, his phone has stopped ringing,
his financings are stalled, his house is for sale and he's
out of business," says Mr. Woods. "But as long as he's front
and center in the publicity department, he's far from out of
business."
