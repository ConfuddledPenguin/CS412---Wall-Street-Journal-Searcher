   Italian sportwear group Stefanel S.p.A. said it signed an
agreement with Tradex, a private Hungarian company, to launch
a chain of ten franchise stores in Hungary by the end of the
year.
   The first store was opened Friday in Budapest; the second
is due to open within weeks in the tourist center of Siofax
on Lake Balaton, Stefanel said.

   Under the agreement, Stefanel will sell in Hungary the
same collections available contemporaneously in Milan, Paris
and New York. The company said the accord marks the first
time a Western clothing manufacturer has agreed to market its
most recent designs in Eastern Europe in local currency.
   Separately, Benetton Group S.p.A. said it opened its first
Soviet outlet on Red Square in Moscow. The store is managed
by the Elegant joint venture, which is 65% Italian. Two more
stores are projected to open in Moscow, as well as a
distribution center that will manage sales of Benetton
products in the Soviet Union and set up stores in Kiev,
Leningrad and Riga.
