   MANAMA -- South Korean companies are likely to win
contracts to rebuild the war-damaged Bandar Khomeini
petrochemical plant in Iran, the official islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
   Citing an interview in the local magazine Iran Exports
with Deputy Oil Minister Ahmad Rahgozar, the agency said
about $1 billion will be invested in completing the plant
during the next five years.

   Earlier this year, a consortium of Japanese companies led
by Mitsui &amp; Co. paid Iran nearly $1 billion in exchange for
an agreement to withdraw from a joint venture set up in the
1970s to build and run Bandar Khomeini.
   Mr. Rahgozar said no final decision has been made, but
that "most probably" the new contractors will be Koreans. He
said $5.71 billion will be spent on Iran's petrochemical
plants during the new five-year plan.
