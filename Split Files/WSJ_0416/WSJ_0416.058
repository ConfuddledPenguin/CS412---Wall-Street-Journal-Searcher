   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said a Massachusetts
state court ordered it to pay about $10 million to 13
minority shareholders in Charterbank, a Plymouth, Mass., bank
that was taken over in 1984 by a company later acquired by
Bank of New England.
   Bank of New England spokesmen confirmed details of the
ruling by Suffolk County Superior Court, but said it had no
immediate comment because the ruling was under review.

1986.
