   NEW YORK -- Eastern Airlines' unsecured creditors spurned
an 11th-hour repayment offer from the airline and instead
pressed their attempt to depose its management and have a
trustee named to run it.
   At the same time, the creditors dug in against Eastern's
request to withdraw $80 million from an escrow fund to
finance second-quarter operations. In a court hearing here
Friday, Eastern attorney Bruce Zirinsky told U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland that the airline needs the money by
today or tomorrow. But the creditors said they wouldn't
consent to any release of money unless a trustee is
appointed. A spokesman for Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp.,
later said Eastern could last the month without the money.

   The combination of the two requests has turned the
hearing, which resumes today and could run through the middle
of the week, into a showdown over Eastern's future. Should a
trustee be named, Eastern would be wrested from the hands of
Texas Air and probably be put up for sale, though finding a
buyer might prove difficult. Eastern has called any
appointment of a trustee the carrier's "death knell." The
outcome is up to Judge Lifland, who, on Friday at least,
appeared impatient with Eastern's attempts to gain time to
fight the creditors.
   Eastern's unsecured creditors had until recently been
supportive of the airline and its attempt to shed excess
assets and rebuild into a smaller carrier. But as Eastern's
losses soared beyond projections, its management alienated
creditors by repeatedly cutting back on how much it proposed
to repay. Arthur B. Newman, hired by the creditors' committee
to assess Eastern's repayment plans, testified Friday, "I've
never in my experience seen a company miss their forecasts by
this large an amount."
   In August, he testified, Eastern had projected a $143
million loss for the fourth quarter of 1989. By Dec. 18, it
had amended that forecast to $254 million. The actual loss,
he testified, was $326 million. Eastern has contended that
much of the losses were beyond its control, as fuel prices
skyrocketed and business travelers continued to shun the
airline.
   Whatever the cause, Eastern presented five separate
business plans to its creditors in the past year, and each
one proposed giving them less than the last. Only two weeks
ago, unsecured creditors were offered 25 cents for every
dollar they're owed. Only five cents of that amount would
have been in cash, the rest was to be in notes guaranteed by
Continental Airlines, Eastern's sister carrier. The creditors
rejected that offer and initiated the move toward a trustee.
   Eastern's most recent offer, made on Friday just hours
before the trustee hearing began, offered even less,
according to people who heard it. The proposal consisted of a
combination of notes, Texas Air stock and cash, although the
cash portion was even lower than the five cents offered
earlier this month. It was after listening to and rejecting
that new, still smaller proposal that creditors pressed ahead
with their demand for a trustee.
   Eastern had originally intended to submit its own
reorganization plan to the court last week, but it changed
its plans as it came under increasing pressure from several
sides.
   One of those groups was the Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corp., the federal agency that administers pension insurance.
The agency claims Eastern's various pension plans are
underfunded by as much as $900 million. If Eastern appears
unable to cover its pension debt, or if control of the
airline shifts, the agency could terminate the plans. Under
pension law, Texas Air and Continental would then be liable
for any amount the agency couldn't get from Eastern.
   Last Thursday, the agency told Texas Air it intended to
terminate Eastern's pension plans immediately, according to
someone familiar with the talks, unless Texas Air agreed it
would remain responsible for the plans if a trustee were
appointed. According to a letter written by Texas Air general
counsel Charles Goolsbee to the agency, Texas Air agreed to
those conditions.
   Texas Air and the agency are continuing to negotiate on a
method of settling the outstanding liability, according to
someone familiar with the talks. Eastern and Texas Air have
maintained that Eastern owes only about $400 million for the
pension plans.
