   Tokyo stocks ended broadly lower in thin trading Friday,
brought down mostly by index-related sales and a lack of any
news to encourage buying support, traders said.
   Stock exchanges in London and most other leading markets
were closed for the Good Friday holiday.

   At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down
409.28 points at 29,213.92. The index added 182.92 points
Thursday.
   The Nikkei index finished the morning session Monday down
637.12 points at 28576.80 points.
   Most participants stayed out of the market ahead of the
weekend and because most overseas markets were closed for the
holiday, traders said. Friday's First Section volume was
estimated at 320 million shares, down from 430 million
Thursday.
   Declining issues clearly outnumbered advancing issues, 672
to 263, while 168 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which fell 1.96 points Thursday, fell
17.45 points, or 0.80%, to 2165.89.
   The Second Section index, which added 10.23 points
Thursday, outperformed the Nikkei and Topix indexes to close
at 3553.25, up 9.40 points, or 0.27%.
   "It's interesting that these smaller-cap shares continue
to do well," said a Japanese equity trader at a foreign
investment bank. "It reflects that several of these selected
issues were oversold," he added.
   Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 11 million
shares, up from 10 million Thursday.
   "Much of the decline was caused by index-related sales,"
said Liam Newberg, a market analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan
Inc.
   Many investors sought to drive up futures prices through
index-linked buying Thursday, the last trading day for April
options accounts. As a result, Friday's activity was
characterized by an unwinding of these positions through
index-linked selling, traders said.
   Participants "were a little alarmed" by the weaker yen and
a softer Japanese government bond market, Mr. Newberg said,
but he added that Friday's decline can largely be attributed
to holiday sentiment, rather than to bearish fundamentals.
   "No one wants to take a large position with the holiday
and the weekend," he said. Because there wasn't any fresh
news surrounding the dollar's continued gains against the
yen, the equity market didn't react to the Japanese
currency's weakness, Mr. Newberg said.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 158.45, above the 158.00 yen
in New York late Thursday and 158.00 yen in Tokyo Thursday.
   But one trader stressed that "the currency is still a
concern. . . and WPI {wholesale price index} data released
today indicate that inflation continues to be a problem."
   The Bank of Japan announced Friday that wholesale prices
jumped 0.7% in March from February, the largest increase
since a 0.7% rise in June 1989, and climbed 3.9% from a year
earlier. In February, overall wholesale prices edged up 0.1%
month-on-month for the third month in a row, while rising
3.5% from a year earlier.
   A Bank of Japan official attributed the steep rise in
overall wholesale prices in March to the effect of the yen's
weakness in foreign exchange markets on import and export
prices during the month.
   Individual companies' performances varied widely within
the sectors, emphasizing the lack of a solid trend and a
search for value Friday.
   A local financial daily's article Friday saying that
Japanese sausage and meat packers are in negotiations to
raise prices between 12% and 14% in May sparked buying in
several food company stocks in the morning, but the shares
ended mixed on the day.
   Nippon Meat slipped 40 yen (25 cents) to 1,660 yen
($10.50) and Marudai Food fell 10 yen to 1,120, while Nissin
Food gained 50 to 3,050.
   In addition, Toray Industries said Friday that one of its
advanced carbon-reinforced plastic products has been approved
by Boeing Co. for use in the primary structure of its
aircraft. The company's stock gained 22 to 788.
   Pharmaceuticals were mostly lower, except for Dainippon,
which gained 50 to 2,590, and Fuso, which surged 150 to
1,600.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Milan and lower
in Taipei and Seoul.
