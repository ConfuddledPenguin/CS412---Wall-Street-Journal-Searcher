   INDIANAPOLIS -- The founder and former chairman and chief
executive officer of Circle Express Inc. was charged in a
federal information with conspiring to provide false
statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Arthur L. Belford, who left Circle Express last year, is
accused of misrepresenting the trucking concern's financial
condition in annual and quarterly SEC and shareholders'
reports in 1986 and 1987.

   In 1988 Mr. Belford, who had resigned from the company
once before, returned to the concern and Circle Express
restated its 1987 and first-quarter 1988 earnings. The
restatements reflected sharply reduced earnings for those
periods compared with those previously reported.
   The new earnings report triggered an investigation by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation that led to the federal
charges. The FBI said Mr. Belford and another, unnamed former
officer and director of Circle Express agreed to misstate
financial information for 1986 and 1987 by manipulating
insurance reserves.
   The information also charges Mr. Belford with
misappropriating "substantial amounts" of corporate assets
through misuse of the company's credit cards, airplane,
condominium and funds. Financial statements failed to
disclose these expenditures, according to the information.
   Circle Express shares were voluntarily removed from public
over-the-counter trading by the National Association of
Securities Dealers last May when shareholder equity fell
below Nasdaq requirements. The company now is under new
management headed by Alfred F. Fasola Jr. of the Taggart
Group, a New Jersey-based investment firm made up of former
officers of Purolator Corp. It recently announced that its
bondholders and banks had accepted a financial restructuring
that would swap a large portion of its $72 million of debt
for equity in the reorganized company.
   Mr. Fasola said he was "not surprised" by Friday's
charges, which he said didn't relate to the current
management.
   "We were aware of some of the problems regarding prior
management when we were brought in to turn this company
around," Mr. Fasola said. With all of the past management
gone, Circle Express is "concentrating on the future,"
according to Mr. Fasola.
   If convicted, Mr. Belford faces a possible penalty of up
to five years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
Neither he nor his attorney returned phone calls seeking
comment. An assistant U.S. attorney in Indianapolis wouldn't
say who the former officer was, whether the person would be
indicted or whether he or she would be a cooperating witness
against Mr. Belford.
   The FBI said the investigation into what it called "a
massive deception of the investing public" is continuing.
