   TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. said a major secured creditor,
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., agreed to extend to Aug. 15 an
arrangement under which it won't call in its $480 million
loan to the financially troubled real-estate and retailing
concern without first giving nine days' notice.
   The previous agreement to give Campeau the nine-day
warning before acting to seize DeBartolo's collateral against
the loan expired Monday. A similar agreement with two units
of the Reichmann family's Olympia &amp; York Developments, which
remains in effect, doesn't have an expiration date.

   Campeau defaulted on the DeBartolo loan as well as $225
million remaining on its Olympia &amp; York loan after its U.S.
retailing units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In
March, Campeau refused to make further interest payments on
the loans.
   The DeBartolo loan is secured mostly against 83.8% of the
stock of Ralphs Grocery Co., Campeau's Southern California
grocery chain. Ralphs isn't involved in the bankruptcy court
proceedings. The Olympia &amp; York loan is secured principally
by some of Campeau's Canadian real-estate assets, which are
slated to be sold.
   The DeBartolo loan helped Campeau finance its $6.6 billion
takeover of Federated in May 1988. DeBartolo is a closely
held real-estate developer in Youngstown, Ohio.
