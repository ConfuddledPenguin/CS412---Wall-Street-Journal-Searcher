   California Federal Bank, Los Angeles, said it agreed to
acquire 13 Southern California branches and $265 million in
deposits from failed Empire Federal Savings Bank of America.
   Terms weren't disclosed. The CalFed Inc. subsidiary said
it would continue operating three of the branches and
consolidate the rest within its existing network. The thrift
said it would have 141 branches in California after the
acquisition, which it hopes to complete on Sept. 7, subject
to regulatory approval.

N.Y., with roughly $10 billion in assets, was seized by
federal regulators earlier this year, and currently is
managed by the Resolution Trust Corp.
