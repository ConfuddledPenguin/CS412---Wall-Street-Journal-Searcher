   NEW YORK -- When CBS News reported exclusively the
deployment of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia, it followed a
prolonged discussion within the network of whether the report
would affect national security.
   "On balance, we felt this was such an important story that
the American public deserved to know," said Joseph Peyronnin,
vice president and assistant to the president at CBS News, a
division of CBS Inc.

   CBS News broke the story at 3:33 p.m. with a report from
its Defense Department correspondent David Martin. Mr. Martin
said, "Frankly, we're reporting this after considerable
debate about whether to report in advance on a troop
movement."
   But once CBS News broke the news, it was quickly followed
by ABC News, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. NBC News -- a
division of General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co.
unit -- went on the air with its story at 4:06. A spokeswoman
said NBC was the first network to report that U.S. troops
were already in Saudi Arabia.
   A spokeswoman for Cable News Network in Atlanta said, "We
had been reporting troop movements out of Fort Bragg {N.C.},
Fort Stewart {Ga.} and Langley Air Force Base {Va.} all
morning." She said CNN reported President Bush's decision to
send troops to Saudi Arabia at 3:44 p.m., citing the CBS
report.
