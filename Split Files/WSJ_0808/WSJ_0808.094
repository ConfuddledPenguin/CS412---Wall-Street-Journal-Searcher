   Howard Ruff, a financial newsletter publisher who was
named president of FundAmerica Inc. last week, said he was
fired by the company's Canadian owners because of his
disclosure of $17 million in withdrawals by the company
founder.
   FundAmerica is an Irvine, Calif.-based discount buying
club under investigation by Florida authorities. Mr. Ruff
assumed the top post there after founder Robert T. Edwards
resigned in the wake of his arrest last month on charges of
organized fraud and conducting an illegal lottery.

   Texas real-estate developer Mitchell Blumberg is
succeeding Mr. Ruff as president and chief executive officer.
"We thought our chances of survival would be better with Mr.
Blumberg," a FundAmerica spokesman said. Mr. Blumberg didn't
return phone calls for comment.
   FundAmerica remains "firmly in the hands of Bob Edwards'
friends and business associates," Mr. Ruff said in a
statement. Mr. Blumberg and Mr. Edwards have been real-estate
associates in Texas, Mr. Ruff has said.
   A Newport Beach, Calif., attorney, whose firm represents
FundAmerica, said in a San Francisco court Monday that
FundAmerica had told him it "was a 99% probability" that the
company would file for bankruptcy-law protection. Yesterday,
the attorney said FundAmerica had retained a separate law
firm that specializes in bankruptcy matters.
   The FundAmerica spokesman said he wasn't aware of any such
plans.
   FundAmerica is owned by FundAmerica Holdings Ltd., a
closely held British Columbia corporation. Mr. Edwards is a
major shareholder and director. He and other shareholders
have placed all of their shares in a trust controlled by
Peter Bradshaw, a consultant to the U.S. company. Neither Mr.
Bradshaw nor Mr. Edwards, free on $1 million bail, could be
reached.
   Several days after he became chief executive, Mr. Ruff
announced that Mr. Edwards had personally made $17 million in
withdrawals from FundAmerica this year, including about $11
million in wire transfers to various entities in Amsterdam
and Hong Kong.
   Florida authorities have filed a cease-and-desist order
against FundAmerica, charging that the club is an elaborate
pyramid scheme. The fund sells $100 annual memberships
entitling members to rebates on vacations, credit-card
purchases, long-distance telephone calls and purchases of
consumer goods.
   Fund America Investor Corp., a Denver-based issuer of
bonds and other securities, said it isn't affiliated with
FundAmerica.
