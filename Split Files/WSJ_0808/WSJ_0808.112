   Capital Associates Inc., a Lakewood, Colo., leasing
concern with financially strapped customers, said it expects
to report losses for the fourth quarter and year ended May
31.
   The amount of the fourth-quarter loss hasn't been
determined. But it will be substantial enough to create a
loss for the year, the company said. In the first nine
months, net income was $1.2 million, or 13 cents a share, on
revenue of $120 million. In fiscal 1989, profit was $8.6
million, or 91 cents a share, on revenue of $140.4 million.

   Capital Associates said the loss will result from reserves
to be established for assets leased to companies experiencing
"severe financial difficulties," among them Integrated
Resources Inc., the real estate and financial-services firm
that sought bankruptcy-law protection in February.
   The company would not say whether it expects continued
losses.
