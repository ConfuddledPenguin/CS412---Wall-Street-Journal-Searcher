   Kirin Brewery Co., Japan's largest brewer, said first-half
unconsolidated pretax profit climbed 30% to 34.77 billion yen
($231.2 million) from 26.73 billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income jumped 49% to 15.86 billion yen, or 15.81 yen a
share, from 10.62 billion yen, or 11.16 yen a share. Net grew
faster than pretax earnings, as extraordinary losses narrowed
to 1.83 billion yen from 3.27 billion yen a year earlier.

   Sales rose 8.7% to 586.94 billion yen from 539.81 billion
yen.
   Officials said demand for beer was strong in the latest
period, pushing sales volume up to post an average of 8%
year-to-year growth among Japanese breweries, despite a rise
in beer prices that went into effect last March. Kirin's
first-half beer sales rose 6.9% to 524.48 billion yen from
490.56 billion yen.
