   WASHINGTON -- Western, Japanese and even Soviet taxpayers,
as well as some big international banks, face a potential
bill totaling tens of billions of dollars because of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Taxpayers are on the hook because their governments, in
order to boost their countries' exports and help Iraq through
its long war with Iran, have guaranteed much of Iraq's $60
billion of foreign borrowings.

   In addition, some international banks, particularly in
Bahrain, have provided billions of dollars to Kuwait's banks
to help fund its financial system. Those obligations now look
doubtful if Iraq's occupation of Kuwait continues.
   Meanwhile, Iraq's biggest government creditors outside the
Middle East are Japan, France and the Soviet Union, with
respective loans totaling $4.5 billion, $4 billion, and from
$5 billion to $6 billion, according to Jonathan Crusoe, Iraq
specialist at the Middle East Economic Digest, a London-based
weekly magazine. Other big creditors include Italy with about
$2 billion of loans, West Germany with $1.5 billion of loans,
and East European countries, which collectively are owed $3
billion to $4 billion, he added.
   The U.S., mainly through the Commodity Credit Corp., has
lent $2.3 billion to Iraq, mostly to finance grain sales.
   And Iraq has received tens of billions of dollars from
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The money, used to help finance
Iraq's war with Iran, has been alternately described as
grants or loans.
   In recent years, Iraq has made payments on its debt to
foreign governments, although these frequently have been
late.
   Foreign governments, though, eager to avoid a crisis, have
often resorted to elaborate schemes to avoid an outright
default by the cash-strapped Iraqis. Japan, for example,
agreed to allow Iraq to use 45% of the oil revenue received
from Japan to service Japan's $4.5 billion of loans to
Baghdad. The Iraqis "have been making small cash payments and
paying the Japanese with oil," said Mr. Crusoe.
   After this week's international embargo, Iraq almost
certainly won't continue to make these payments, London
bankers and experts familiar with the region say. They warn
that if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait, foreign governments
will have to make good on their guarantees. Such guarantees
generally cover 80% or 90% of a loan. "One assumes that Iraq
won't continue to service its obligations to those countries
implementing the embargo," said Philip Robbins, Middle East
specialist at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a
London-based think tank.
   Even prior to Iraq's invasion, banks in London traded the
unguaranteed portion of loans to Iraq at about 45 cents for
each dollar of face value of these obligations, according to
bankers there. Under current regulations, the Bank of England
requires that unguaranteed loans to Iraq be backed by
reserves of between 76% and 85% of the loan's face value,
according to one London banker.
   But there are other risks for banks. Some large
institutions, particularly in Bahrain but also in bigger
international financial centers such as New York and London,
also face potential losses from the invasion of Kuwait,
bankers in London and New York say.
   Kuwaiti banks have borrowed substantial funds from the
international financial system, and those obligations now
might not be repaid. Bankers estimate that as much as $20
billion of the Kuwaiti banks' $50 billion of assets may have
been funded from the interbank market, much of it from
Bahrain. That could lead to banks having to dig into earnings
to add to their loan-loss provisions.
   Meanwhile, some international financial institutions
associated with Kuwait have had their assets unfrozen by U.S.
and British authorities. After the invasion, the U.S. and
some European countries froze Kuwaiti assets to ensure they
didn't fall into Iraqi hands.
   For example, United Bank of Kuwait, a consortium bank
based in London and owned by Kuwait's commercial banks, has
had its assets unfrozen by the U.S. and British authorities,
bank staff say. Most of its assets are outside Kuwait in any
case. The Kuwait Investment Office, the London-based manager
of tens of billions of dollars of Kuwaiti money, also is
understood to be negotiating with the Bank of England to
allow it to resume business, bankers say.
