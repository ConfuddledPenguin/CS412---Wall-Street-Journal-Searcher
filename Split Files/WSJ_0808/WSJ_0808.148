   A federal judge in Cleveland issued a court order
proposing that the Manville personal-injury trust be turned
into a national facility for settling all asbestos cases. The
facility would use the combined resources of the Manville
trust, other asbestos defendants and their insurers.
   The recommendation by U.S. District Judge Thomas D.
Lambros would create a sweeping claims-resolution facility
supervised by federal and state judges. Judge Lambros said
the arrangement would be less costly and more efficient than
other proposals to clear court dockets of their backlog of
asbestos cases.

   Judge Lambros, who has thousands of asbestos cases pending
before him, said the trust should be merged with the Center
for Claims Resolution in Princeton, N.J., through which
several former asbestos makers now resolve some cases.
   Judge Lambros said the facility could begin operating
within 90 days, initially with the voluntary participation of
asbestos claimants. Several federal judges are meeting Friday
in Washington to discuss possible solutions to the backlog of
asbestos cases, and Judge Lambros said his proposal could be
used to implement whatever long-term proposal the judges come
up with.
   Although Judge Lambros's plan could get the ball rolling
on a national settlement of the asbestos litigation, it puts
him at odds with U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn,
N.Y., who has authority over the Manville trust.
   Judge Weinstein is pressuring the trust to come up with a
plan to restructure its financing by Sept. 6. Judge Lambros
in his order, however, said the trust should be left alone
until Nov. 1 "to permit the joint efforts {of the judges who
are meeting Friday} to achieve meaningful results in
promulgating and implementing national solutions." Judge
Lambros and Judge Weinstein are expected to be two of the
main players in Friday's meeting.
   A spokeswoman for the Manville trust declined to comment.
The trust, which is independent of Manville Corp., was the
cornerstone of the company's bankruptcy-court reorganization
plan in 1986. The trust, which owns 80% of Manville's stock,
was set up to pay asbestos personal-injury claims against the
former asbestos maker. Asbestos, once widely used as
insulation, causes cancer and respiratory illnesses.
   Judge Lambros also asked in his order that no decision be
made until Nov. 1 on whether to form a national class action
for the asbestos claims. Such proposals are pending before
Judge Lambros, Judge Weinstein and another federal judge in
Texas. Judge Lambros has set a hearing for Nov. 1 on the
class-action proposal in his court in Cleveland.
   Judge Lambros's order regarding the Manville trust was one
of several proposals discussed yesterday by asbestos
plaintiffs' attorneys at a meeting in Washington. The
attorneys' own recommendations on how to handle a nationwide
resolution of the cases are expected to be presented to the
judges Friday.
   Louis Robles, an attorney from Miami who attended the
meeting, said about half a dozen alternatives were proposed
by the lawyers. Mr. Robles said Judge Lambros's latest
suggestion "has some serious drawbacks because the {Center
for Claims Resolution} hasn't settled cases as quickly as we
hoped they would."
   Officials and attorneys for the center couldn't be reached
for comment.

   EMPLOYERS HAVE RIGHT to reduce retiree benefits, appeals
court rules.
   A federal court ruling allows companies to reduce health
benefits for retired employees under the federal statute
regulating employee benefits known as the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.
   The Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
found that Container Corp. of America, a St. Louis
manufacturer of packaging products, hadn't violated ERISA
when it reduced retiree health insurance benefits and
substantially increased the amount of money employees must
contribute to the plan.
   "Employers are beginning to take a significant look at
continuing to foot the bill for retiree health care," says
Columbus R. Gangemi of the Chicago firm Winston &amp; Strawn, who
represented the company. "It has become a massive obligation
that employers are no longer in a position to bear."
   The class action suit, filed by retired plant manager
Robert N. Alday on behalf of about 1,000 employees, alleged
that Container Corp. violated ERISA because it never informed
employees that the company might change the amount employees
must contribute to the plan. The defendants also include
Jefferson Smurfit Corp., Container's parent company, and
Smurfit Pension and Insurance Co., the pension plan
consultant. Both are based in St. Louis.
   Mr. Alday said that letters sent to retired employees
about the plan's costs and the company's annual summary of
benefits led employees to believe that the premiums would not
increase. A similar suit filed by retired union employees of
Container Corp. is pending.
   The appeals panel ruled that the defendants had reserved
the right to change health benefits in a formal written
document required under ERISA. Other, more informal documents
allegedly contradicting that right must be ignored, the panel
wrote.
   The lawyer for the plaintiffs, John MacLennan of the
Jacksonville, Fla., firm Kattman, Eshelman &amp; MacLennan, said
he plans to seek a rehearing or review by the U.S. Supreme
Court. But, he adds, Congress ultimately will have to address
the issue.
   "Many of the plaintiffs spent 20, 30, 40 years with the
company," says Mr. MacLennan. "Now when they're retired,
their entire pension check is being eaten up by these
premiums."

   GENERAL DEVELOPMENT Corp.'s plea negotiations break down.
   The Miami home developer faces a Jan. 7 trial date on
conspiracy and fraud charges. The company said it couldn't
reach an agreement with the U.S. Attorney overseeing its
prosecution with respect to the amount and terms of
restitution to be paid to thousands of buyers who allegedly
overpaid General Development for homes based on inflated
property appraisals.
   The parties had been trying to reach a revised accord
before attending a status conference yesterday with U.S.
District Judge Lenore Nesbitt. As reported, the judge
rejected an earlier plea agreement reached between the
company and prosecutors, saying it didn't give her adequate
flexibility to set a sentence in light of the severity of the
charges.
   General Development said it was willing to pay out $100
million to buyers upon approval of its plan by the court -- a
much faster pace for restitution than was envisioned under
the earlier pact, which gave the company 25 years to make the
payments.
   The company said that prosecutors have insisted it plead
guilty to defrauding all customers who bought homes between
1983 and 1989, something it isn't willing to do, and to agree
to a restitution plan that it believes would leave it unable
to treat other creditors fairly. General Development filed
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy
code last spring.
   Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney, said
the prosecution has "a great many problems with the
restitution plan" proposed by the company.
   Thus far the only individuals charged in the case are
David F. Brown, the former chairman of the company, and
Robert F. Ehrling, its former president. But at a hearing
yesterday, the prosecution indicated it may seek indictments
against up to seven other former employees of General
Development.

   ARKANSAS MUST STOP DRILLING in Crater of Diamonds State
Park.
   U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little
Rock, Ark., permanently enjoined the state from drilling test
holes at the park, which is the only place in the U.S. where
tourists can dig for diamonds. The state had drilled four
test holes, using $350,000 provided by four private mining
companies interested in commercially mining the diamonds at
the park.
   The state had argued that it wanted to drill up to 30
holes in the diamond-bearing "pipe" at the park so that it
could use the information in a park educational program.
However, the evidence presented to the court clearly
indicated that the state "had commercial mining as its actual
goal," the judge ruled.
   The judge ruled the park's decision to permit drilling
"was arbitrary, capricious and not supported by substantial
evidence." She also ruled that converting the park from
public use to private use by allowing commercial mining would
violate the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965.
Under the act, conversion of public lands to private uses is
prohibited if the act's funds are used to buy or improve the
public lands. Arkansas received $700,000 from the fund in
1976 to improve the park.
   The state parks commission will meet some time in the next
two weeks to decide whether to appeal. The mining companies
involved declined to comment or didn't return phone calls.
   The decision is only the third federal court decision to
test the Land and Water Conservation Fund provisions and may
be the first case in Arkansas that applies the public trust
doctrine to state lands, said Jim Stanley, attorney for the
Sierra Club, which was one of the plaintiffs in the case.
   "We can use this decision to help protect other parks from
commercialization and encroachment by private interests," he
said.

   JUDGE THROWS OUT ruling against the FDIC.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas E. Scott in Miami vacated his
default judgment against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
A default judgment is a ruling in one party's favor when its
opponent fails to meet a requirement of the court. Judge
Scott had ruled that the federal agency had missed a deadline
for responding to a lender liability suit. The FDIC argued
that as a federal agency it has 60 days to respond instead of
the 20-day period allotted other litigants.
   The plaintiff, Overseas Investment Recovery Corp., claims
that the FDIC, after taking over Vernon Savings &amp; Loan
Association in Dallas in 1986, breached its obligations to
Overseas as a borrower and reneged on agreements to settle
litigation on several occasions.
   Brenda Collier, an attorney for the FDIC, said the agency
is also seeking court costs and sanctions against the
Overseas' lawyer for seeking the default.
   James F. Gilbride, Overseas' attorney, said, "We're
confident the court will not impose sanctions."

   U.S. SUPREME COURT Justice John Paul Stevens told lawyers
attending the American Bar Association annual convention in
Chicago that nominees for the High Court should not be asked
by Congress to expound on their views on controversial
subjects because their answers won't necessarily indicate how
they will vote in particular cases. "There are some important
values at stake in maintaining the independence of the
nominee as he or she goes through the confirmation process,"
he said. There has been much debate in Congress about whether
Judge David Souter, who is being considered for the High
Court, should be asked about his views on abortion.
