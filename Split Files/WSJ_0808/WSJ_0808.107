   NEW YORK -- Despite growing gloom about the stock market's
prospects, many pension funds and other big investors say
their current strategy is to hang on tight for the ride.
   "You can scare the wits out of yourself if you want to,"
Joseph W. Perrone, chief investment officer of the $25
billion Texas Teacher Retirement System, said of the
heightened prospects for recession because of rocketing oil
prices.

   Still, Mr. Perrone, like many other big investors, said he
hasn't soured on stocks despite suffering "screen shock"
watching the market plunge in recent days. "Things would have
to get a whole lot clearer before we would do some bold moves
in the market," he said.
   Some big investors have been increasingly edgy about the
U.S. economy and stock prices for months before the latest
Mideast turmoil, causing them to trim stock portfolios
slowly. For example, the $58 billion California Public
Employees Retirement Fund has cut stock holdings to 38% of
its assets from 42% 18 months ago. But the latest market
declines haven't prompted more selling by the California
fund, the nation's largest public employee fund.
   "We're pretty well set for the long term," DeWitt Bowman,
chief investment officer of the California fund, said of the
38% stock holding. "You can't move $58 billion around the
markets that quickly and achieve any significant incremental
returns," he said.
   Most big investors agree. "We're not smart enough to move
in and out of the market on events like these," said Fred G.
Weiss, head of Warner-Lambert Co.'s $1.3 billion pension
fund. "We've stood pat for the last three or four days, and
we're not going to make any big asset change because of
this."
   The Warner-Lambert fund was in the process of cutting its
stock position last week before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
But Mr. Weiss stopped selling on the invasion news to avoid
getting caught up in the market turmoil.
   "By the time something like this hits, it's too late to do
anything about it," said David P. Feldman, vice president for
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s $40 billion pension
fund. "What you do is cover your bets" beforehand, he said.
   Mostly that means spreading assets among different types
of investments, which big funds can afford to do. AT&amp;T, for
example, has held stakes for years in oil and gas exploration
and development properties, even though they looked like poor
bets through much of the 1980s. "They are there for days like
these," Mr. Feldman said of the oil and gas properties, now
made more attractive as a result of the past week's surge in
oil prices.
   Certainly, some big investors have been selling during the
latest market declines. And because institutional investors
hold more than 40% of U.S. stocks, sales of even a small part
of institutional portfolios can sharply depress stock prices.
   Institutions have cut their holdings of New York Stock
Exchange issues by almost $2 billion between July 16, when
the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its record high of
2999.75 points, and the start of this week, according to
stock market strategist Laszlo Birinyi.
   While that cutback is substantial, it is less than half
the money that fled the stock market during the Oct. 19,
1987, market crash. There has been no sign so far of the
panicky selling by big investors that swamped the market
during the crash.
   At the same time, there is little evidence as yet that
institutions are forging back into the market this time, as
many big investors did in late 1987, or again after the
190.58-point industrial average drop in October 1989.
"Everybody is going to be hesitant about increasing positions
here," said Kenneth G. Mertz II, chief investment officer of
the $10 billion Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement
System.
   A big reason for caution, said Mr. Mertz and other pension
fund managers, is that the economy is far weaker than was the
case during those earlier stock market plunges. "We're a lot
more concerned about going into a recession and the
stagflation possibilities," said William F. Quinn, president
of AMR Investment Services, a money-management unit of the
airline company.
   "I don't know if recession is the right word, but it's
going to be harder than a soft landing," said
Warner-Lambert's Mr. Weiss.
   James S. Martin, executive vice president of the $38
billion College Retirement Equities Fund, said rising oil
prices "could very well put the economy over to a mild
recession." For the moment, he's taking a wait-and-see
stance, without doing any unusual buying or selling in the
fund's U.S. portfolio.
   However, Mr. Martin has used some of the fund's cash
reserves to buy particularly hard-hit European stocks. On
Monday, he said, "they were giving some stuff away in Europe,
so we've been trying to put some money to work there."
   Most pension-fund managers say they do best by adopting a
long-term investment strategy and sticking to it, rather than
reacting to unfolding events. That's because successfully
timing market moves is difficult for any investor, but even
more so for the big pension funds that can have tens of
billions of dollars in assets.
   "It's like turning an aircraft carrier," AT&amp;T's Mr.
Feldman said of maneuvering a pension fund's investment
strategy. "You need a lot of time and room to do it."
