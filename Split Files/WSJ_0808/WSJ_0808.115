   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc., which is locked in a bitter
proxy battle with its former chairman, said it completed
credit agreements for $31.7 million.
   The apparel maker said Congress Financial Corp., a
subsidiary of CoreStates Financial Corp., will provide up to
$20 million of financing and the company's current U.S.
lenders, headed by a unit of Security Pacific Corp., will
provide an additional $6.1 million. In addition, Standard
Chartered Bank, a unit of Standard Chartered PLC of Britain,
is providing up to #3 million ($5.6 million) for use in
Britain and Ireland. All of the loans are for two years.

   The company said Standard Chartered is also providing a
customs bond to Farah's U.K. operations of up to #500,000 and
a contingent letter of credit to Congress Financial of $2
million.
   The announcement brought some relief to Farah before a
special shareholders' meeting Friday requested by William F.
Farah, the company's ousted former chairman. The company has
indicated that it needed to complete new financing agreements
to avert a liquidity crisis.
   Mr. Farah, who owns nearly 16% of the company's common
stock outstanding, is waging a proxy contest to regain
control of Farah, which has been reporting losses and
declining sales for several years. He is seeking to replace
seven of the nine directors. Mr. Farah couldn't be reached
for comment.
   For the six months ended April 30, Farah had a net loss of
$2 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $59.9 million.
The company has indicated it also expects a third-quarter
loss.
