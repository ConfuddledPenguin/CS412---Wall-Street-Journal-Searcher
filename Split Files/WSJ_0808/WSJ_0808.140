   NEW YORK -- Health-care stocks are traditionally
considered good investments for a recession because no matter
how bad the economy gets, people still need medical care.
   But recession-wary investors now tempted to stash some of
their money in health-care stocks may want to note that
executives, directors and other industry "insiders" have
recently been selling.

   In fact, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show
that the health-care industry has recently been leading all
other industries in stock sales by insiders, overtaking the
computer industry, which had long held the dubious
distinction of "most sold."
   Forty-four of the 167 health-care and hospital companies
tracked by Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm that keeps
tabs on such matters, were involved in recent insider sales.
   All together, 134 insiders were net sellers of about 5.6
million shares since April 1, according to reports filed with
the SEC. While the insiders were largely taking profits after
run-ups in the sector's stocks, many top executives sold
significant percentages of their holdings.
   "Across the board, the picture for this group" of stocks
"indicates it's at the higher level of valuation," said
Robert Gabele, Invest/Net's president. Even with the stock
market's overall decline of the past few days, he said, "the
jury's still out on whether there's a buying opportunity in
these stocks yet."
   Right now, the health-care sector includes "a number of
stocks that were overpriced, and, in some cases, there are
some problems in the companies," said John Kaweske, portfolio
manager of Financial Programs Inc.'s Financial Health, a
mutual fund that invests in health-care, biotechnology and
pharmaceutical stocks.
   With the possibility of a recession, Mr. Kaweske said he
recently sold all of his health maintenance organization
stocks because he predicts they won't thrive in a period of
federal budget constraints. But he bought shares of
Healthdyne Inc. yesterday because the company is working on
moving medical procedures out of the high-cost hospital
setting.
   The health-care company with the largest number of recent
insider sellers is U.S. Surgical Corp., a Norwalk, Conn.,
manufacturer of surgical staples and instruments, according
to Invest/Net and SEC filings. All told, 13 U.S. Surgical
insiders have sold company stock since April 1, the filings
show.
   Leon Hirsch, the company's chairman, said the 13 sold the
stock to "enjoy a better standard of living." He said he sold
27,000 shares to expand his ranch in Wyoming, but retains
stock and options representing more than two million shares.
   The insiders sold a total of 246,964 shares at an average
price of about $34.78 a share. The stock closed in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday at $40.25, up 62.5
cents.
   "You couldn't find a more bullish group," Mr. Hirsch said,
because whether there's a recession or not, the company is
insulated. "Somebody doesn't have their gall bladder out
because they're in or out of a recession."
   At National Medical Enterprises, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
owner and operator of hospitals and medical-care facilities,
eight insiders have sold 305,591 shares valued at about $10.7
million since April 5, SEC filings show. They sold at an
average price of $34.98 a share; the stock closed on the Big
Board at $34.625, up 37.5 cents.
   The largest sale was by the company's president, Leonard
Cohen, who sold 200,000 shares on May 15, retaining about
750,000 shares, according to the company. About a third of
the shares he sold were directly related to the exercise of
options six months earlier, a company spokesman said. He
added that Mr. Cohen sold the stock to pay taxes.
   At United Healthcare Corp., a Minnetonka, Minn., company
that owns and operates 15 HMOs and other health-related
businesses, Chairman Kennett Simmons, has sold all his
holdings, SEC filings show. He sold 92,982 shares in May at
an average price of $13.04 a share. In national
over-the-counter trading, the stock closed at $17.50, up
$62.50.
   "I took care to sell at a time when I was particularly
confident of the company's future," Mr. Simmons said. The
executive, who said he has restricted stock grants and
options equivalent to 500,000 shares, said he sold the stock
to make investments and to build a house.
   At Healthdyne, a Marietta, Ga., healthcare provider, Terry
Dewberry, the company's president, sold all of his 60,450
shares in May, SEC filings show. Two other insiders sold
5,000 and 15,000 shares, respectively, according to the
filings.
   Mr. Dewberry declined to comment, but a company spokesman
said the president still has options to purchase 210,000
shares. Healthdyne shares closed at $12, up 87.5 cents, in
over-the-counter trading. The insiders sold at an average
per-share price of $10.73.
   Martin J. Raynes, a director of Medco Containment Services
Inc., a Fairlawn, N.J., company specializing in providing
prescription drug programs to corporate health-care plans,
sold 97% of his holdings in May, SEC filings show. He sold
281,235 shares for $5.6 million, or an average price of about
$19.80 a share, the filings show. Mr. Raynes declined to
comment. Medco Containment shares closed at $23.50, up 75
cents, in over-the-counter trading.
