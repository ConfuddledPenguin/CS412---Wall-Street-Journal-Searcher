   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms fell slightly in the week ended
Tuesday.
   The average yield on six-month small-denomination CDs sold
directly by banks slipped to 7.42% from 7.53%, according to
an 18-bank national survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a New
York information service. The average yield for five-year
consumer CDs fell to 7.87% from 8.01%.
