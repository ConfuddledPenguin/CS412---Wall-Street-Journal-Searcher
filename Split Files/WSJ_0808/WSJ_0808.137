   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department urged the Department
of Transportation to rescind the antitrust exemption under
which U.S. airlines participate in fare-setting for
international flights.
   The department said that the fare-setting practices of the
Geneva-based International Air Transport Association, the
trade group for the major world airlines, are
anti-competitive and result in higher fares.

   IATA's members, acting under a grant of antitrust immunity
first granted in 1946 by the U.S. government, hold tariff
conferences to set fares. In 1985, the DOT extended the
exemption, but said it would review the policy in five years.
The Justice Department's recommendation was in response to
IATA's application for a renewed exemption.
   The recommendation wasn't unexpected. The Justice
Department had sought to end the exemption in the late 1970s
and early 1980s, according to Bert Rein, one of IATA's
Washington attorneys. "The aeronautical experts rejected it,"
he said.
   The Transportation Department declined to comment on the
filing.
