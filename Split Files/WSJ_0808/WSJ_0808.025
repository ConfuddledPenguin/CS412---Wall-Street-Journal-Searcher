   PITTSBURGH -- Consolidated Natural Gas Co. said it
received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to provide new services to utilities and other
wholesale natural gas customers in Virginia.
   Under plans approved by the commission, the natural gas
concern's CNG Transmission Corp. unit would provide long-term
natural gas sales service to Virginia Natural Gas Inc. and
Richmond's municipal gas utility. To provide the new
services, CNG Transmission will construct facilities,
including a 27-mile pipeline extension.
