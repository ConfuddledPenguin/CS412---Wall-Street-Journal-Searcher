   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actors' Equity barred an English actor
from repeating his performance as a Eurasian brothel owner in
the Broadway production of the hit London musical "Miss
Saigon."
   The decision by the union's council could jeopardize the
New York production of the show, scheduled to open in March.
Last week, Cameron Mackintosh, the musical's producer, said
he would withdraw the show if Jonathan Pryce were not allowed
to perform in New York.

   "The casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian
is an affront to the Asian community," the union said.
   "The casting choice is especially disturbing when the
casting of an Asian actor in this role would be an important
and significant opportunity to break the usual pattern of
casting Asians in minor roles," the union said.
   Mr. Mackintosh was vacationing and could not be reached
for comment.
   Alan Eisenberg, the union's executive secretary, indicated
that Mr. Mackintosh could submit the matter to arbitration,
which would involve Actors' Equity and the League of American
Theaters and Producers.
   The Actors' Equity Association has jurisdiction over all
performers appearing on Broadway and must give its approval
to actors from foreign countries who appear there.
