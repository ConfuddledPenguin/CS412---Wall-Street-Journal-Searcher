   DALLAS -- Heritage Media Corp. said it obtained financing
of $220 million and used a portion of the loans to refinance
existing debts of its broadcast and Act Media units.
   The owner of television and radio stations said it expects
to use the remainder of the financing to fund its pending
acquisition of the 43% of POP Radio Corp. it doesn't already
own. Heritage's current acquisition offer expires Oct. 31.
