   BUSH ORDERED U.S. combat planes and troops to Saudi Arabia
and Turkey.
   The president's decision to send thousands of troops and
warplanes came after the U.S. detected new Iraqi military
moves in the region. Defense Secretary Cheney apparently had
reached a pact Monday with Saudi King Fahd on the deployment
in the Mideast, and Secretary of State Baker is to leave for
Turkey, whose bases also appear to be part of the military
plan. Egypt is believed to have been enlisted in the effort.
Bush's immediate risk involves the vulnerability of about
3,000 U.S. civilians in Kuwait and 500 in Iraq -- including
39 Americans being held in a Baghdad hotel.

   Iraq's Hussein, speaking on Baghdad radio, warned against
any outside efforts to force him from Kuwait, saying the
Iraqis would "pluck out the eyes of those who attack the Arab
nation."
