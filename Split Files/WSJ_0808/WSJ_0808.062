   NEW YORK -- First Boston Corp. said it repackaged $245
million of low-rated junk bonds into new securities with
credit ratings as high as double-A.
   The First Boston transaction marks a bit of revival for
such repackagings, which are known as collateralized bond
obligations. CBOs briefly flourished last year, when they
were hailed as a way to make junk-bond investing palatable to
mainstream, credit-conscious investors. After a few boom
months, however, CBOs fell into obscurity during the general
junk-bond collapse of early 1990.

   Robert Long, director of high-yield research at First
Boston, said the CBO is his firm's second such offering this
year; the first occurred in February. "I expect we'll see
significantly more of these," he said.
   The CBO is being sold to First Boston Asset Management, a
unit of First Boston that invests money for pension funds and
other clients. It was structured as a private placement that
didn't need to be registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   First Boston is a unit of CS First Boston Group.
   Mr. Long said the CBO draws upon a freshly acquired $245
million portfolio of bonds that are rated double-B and
single-B. Interest and principal payments from those bonds
will be divided into three sets of new securities. Two of
these new classes of securities, totaling $117 million and
$49 million, will be "over-collateralized," with more than
$117 million and $49 million respectively of junk bonds
backing them up, Mr. Long said.
   That way, even if some of the individual bonds default,
these two classes still would collect adequate cash flows to
meet their stated yields of 1.8 percentage points and 2.1
percentage points above rates on comparable Treasury
securities, First Boston said. This overcollateralization
also allows those two classes to qualify for double-A
ratings, First Boston said.
   The CBO's final class, however, will be far riskier. It
will have far less specific junk-bond collateral. Instead, it
will be entitled to whatever interest income is left over
from the junk bonds that back the first two classes, once the
two double-A segments have made their obligatory payments. If
default rates are what First Boston expects, the bottom class
could yield more than 20%, Mr. Long said. If default rates
are a lot higher, the bottom class could yield very little or
even be a source of losses for investors.
