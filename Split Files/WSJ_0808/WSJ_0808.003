   KITAKYUSHU CITY, Japan -- At the foot of a glitzy space
dome, attendants in gold-colored suits hawk tickets for a
cruise through a black hole. Lunar creatures flap their wings
outside a rumbling space ship. The only reminder that this
gleaming fantasy land is on Earth is the rusting hulk of a
blast furnace atop a nearby hill.
   Welcome to Space World, a 30 billion yen ($200 million)
attempt by giant Nippon Steel Corp. to revitalize the
declining industrial district in this smokestack city 500
miles southeast of Tokyo.

   "It was a big decision for us to move into the leisure
industry," says Tsutomu Koike, president of Space World Inc.,
a subsidiary of Nippon Steel. His shift two years ago from a
job managing the company's steel operations to running the
theme park was like "an encounter with the unknown," he
jokes. Today, the former steel center has roller coasters,
space training camps for children and a pair of goggle-eyed
mascots, Lucky and Vicky Rabbit. In the year ending next
April, the company hopes to lure two million visitors to this
rundown factory town.
   Nippon Steel is in the vanguard of a movement shaking up
industrial Japan. Thanks to corporate diversification and
consumers' increasing craving for leisure activities, at
least nine parks are opening in Japan this year, and as many
as 100 more are on the drawing board. Analysts expect
receipts from Japan's amusement-park industry, which this
year will total about 360 billion yen, to double in the next
several years.
   Trading houses, railroad companies and even stodgy
shipbuilders are striving to create their own theme parks.
Old-line companies looking for new businesses "are all
attracted to the leisure industry," says Yuji Nemoto, who
studies theme parks for the Japan Development Bank. "They
have the land, the people and the resources to spare."
   Everyone's dream is to enjoy the enormous success of Tokyo
Disneyland, the country's first large theme park. Since it
was built seven years ago, the Japanese home of Snow White
and Mickey Mouse has been mobbed. Nearly 15 million people
visited the park in the year ended March 31, boosting sales
by 12% from a year ago to 133 billion yen.
   Straining for good ideas, many Japanese companies are
tapping American theme park operators and consultants,
providing a lucrative market for the U.S. entertainment
industry. Risk-averse companies are looking to import
ready-made U.S. successes. A Japanese version of Sesame
Place, a children's park with Sesame Street characters, is to
open this fall. Another possibility is an import of MCA
Inc.'s Universal Studios. Others are paying such American
planners as Sequoia Creative Inc. and Ride &amp; Show Engineering
Inc. to come up with ideas including coal mine tours and boat
rides complete with pirate attacks.
   With all the added competition, some parks surely won't
make it. "After natural selection, the question is which ones
will survive," says Mr. Nemoto.
   Simply setting a theme for the parks isn't enough to
attract a crowd, says Kenji Sugiura, general manager of the
business department at Ride &amp; Show's Japanese joint venture
operation. "They have to provide an out-of-the-ordinary
experience."
   As novice Japanese entrepreneurs reach the construction
stages for their proposed theme parks, more may turn to U.S.
entertainment companies, Mr. Sugiura says. Using its
knowledge from planning projects for Disneyland and Universal
Studios, the company hopes to have sales of 40 billion yen
within the next few years.
   The rush to create new parks has led to some far-fetched
ideas for attractions, such as a Mongolian tent village and
an indoor wind-surfing pool. Madarao Bi-Lingual Land, a theme
park planned to open in two years by English-school chain
BiLingual Co., will welcome guests by sending them through a
mock customs and immigration department. The 9.5 billion-yen
park will have an old European flavor, with a lilac-colored
castle by a lake, and the Japanese waiters and hotel
receptionists will speak to visitors only in English.
   So eager are companies to participate in the boom that
some are setting up temporary parks for the summer. Gakken
Co., a publishing company, in a project with other Japanese
companies, rented a convention hall outside Tokyo and set up
a dinosaur-theme attraction. Among the displays are the
bones, borrowed from a Canadian museum, of 21 dinosaurs, as
well as six samples of fossilized droppings. The attraction
will close in early September.
   With so many plans cropping up at once, though, there is
some replication: two Spanish villas and a pair of
Scandinavian towns soon will be built. Four northern Japanese
towns squabbled over rights to build a Santa Land in Japan,
crushing plans by two of the contenders.
   Some of the parks may have a way to go to satisfy Japanese
consumers, many of whom are used to Disneyland's thoroughly
planned extravaganza. Some visitors wonder if Space World's
monotonous silver buildings and drawings of space objects on
the walls can persuade customers to make a second trip. And
the metal buildings reflected so much heat that visitors
demanded water fountains around the park.
   "The place is rather cheap-looking," says Toshiaki Fujii,
a disappointed 41-year-old who runs a 7-Eleven convenience
store in a nearby city. "If there were real space ships and
space shuttles, or even something close, it would have been
another thing."
   "I thought this would be a bit bigger," says Akihiro
Yanagida, a 31-year-old security guard from nearby Fukuoka,
looking up at the 58-meter replica of the space shuttle
Discovery. Even after learning that the full-sized model
blasts fire three times a day for show, Mr. Yanagida still
isn't impressed.
   For congested Japan, at least, transportation won't be a
problem for some visitors at the Narita Japan Village. The
park, to be built next to the international airport outside
Tokyo, will allow tourists to take a tour of "Japan" without
even having to take the two-hour bus ride into Tokyo.
