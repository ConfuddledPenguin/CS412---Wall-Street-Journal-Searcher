   Family businesses seeking capital first need to face the
music: Their companies may be worth much less than a few
years ago. But for the right deal, there is plenty of money
around, often from other family businesses.
   So says Jonathan J. Ledecky, a partner in Legacy Fund in
Washington, D.C. In terms of making famous deals, the
youthful Mr. Ledecky is no Henry Kravis. But he does have a
specialty that interests many entrepreneurs: finding outside
investors for small family companies.

   A 1983 graduate of Harvard Business School, Mr. Ledecky
gained financial experience working for other concerns. Last
year, he and a partner, Timothy R. Furey, founded Legacy, an
investment-management company. Currently, Legacy says it is
seeking to make deals jointly with two other firms -- J.
Holdsworth Capital Ltd. in Boston and Scovill Holdings Inc.
in Philadelphia. Legacy this year acquired a 33% stake in
Snow Environmental Services Inc., Aston, Pa.
   In an interview, Mr. Ledecky provided some insights on
attracting capital:
                                                                                                       

   Q. How can a family company attract outside investment?
   A. The most important thing is to have a realistic
expectation of what the business can be sold for. Prices have
changed dramatically over the past two years. At the height
of the feeding frenzy on Wall Street, small businesses were
beginning to command multiples that were in the same range as
those for big businesses: eight to 10 times pretax profit or
cash flow. Now negotiations start in the four-to-five-times
range, but buyers' expectations have remained in the
eight-to-10 range. Buyers and sellers are settling somewhere
between four and six.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How much do attractive small businesses really make?
   A. Pretax margins or cash flow can be between 15% and 25%
of sales, which are outstanding margins. That's much
healthier than the widespread perception of small business,
which is that owners eke out a living with a 5% to 7% profit.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Need companies be profitable to attract investors?
   A. We want to work with businesses that have a record of
profitability, because those companies fall at the lower end
of the risk spectrum. But we will make an exception. At
Nutcracker Snacks, {a Billerica, Mass., snack-foods
marketer}, Holdsworth saw a way to accomplish a turnaround,
so it went in and did it. The packaging of the nuts needed to
be changed, the mix of the nuts needed to be changed, and the
marketing channels that the nuts sold through needed to be
changed. Now the family is sharing in the profits from
turnaround.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Besides family companies, are there any other small
companies worth investing in?
   A. Public companies sometimes have divisions that get
orphaned; they no longer meet the strategic fit of the
business. They want to divest themselves of these divisions,
but the divisions are far too small to attract traditional
buyers. In the case of Western Sky Industries Inc., {a
Hayward, Calif., company formerly owned by Atlas Corp.},
Scovill in essence has created a small business, or
family-like business, where none existed before. Western Sky
makes parts for the aerospace and auto industries. It was
appealing because it provided an entree into several
businesses at the same time.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How do you see Legacy's role?
   A. We try to fly below the radar of Wall Street to find
companies that are small. There is tremendous interest today
in investing in small family-held businesses by families that
have created large amounts of wealth through businesses of
their own. We aim for a 30% to 40% compound annual return
over a five-year period.
   The investment from any one family could be as little as
$100,000 or as much as $2.5 million -- that's the range we've
seen interest at.
   We focus on small, family-held businesses that have been
consistently profitable for a decade or more. The risk
profile is low, because we're buying businesses that have
been around a long time, with high ratios of cash flow to
sales. They aren't sexy businesses, but year in and year out,
they're making money.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How receptive are family businesses to outsiders'
buy-out or investment offers?
   A. It's incredibly difficult to purchase a family
business. The amount of politics, the amount of psychology,
the amount of handholding all are enormous. Once I had to
meet the wife of the business owner, even though she wasn't
involved in the business. She peppered me for six hours with
questions, and I had to pass her scrutiny. Another time, two
brothers who owned a company insisted on bringing not only
their wives to the meeting, but all their cousins. We had a
six-hour meeting in a hotel conference room with 25 people.

   Q. Investments in small businesses aren't very liquid. How
do you plan to realize any gains?
   A. Ultimately what we want to do is purchase family
businesses in consolidating industries -- industries where an
aggregation program is going on. We hope to put businesses
together and sell them. For example, at Clayton Holdings
Inc., {a Tampa, Fla., pipe company that Holdsworth bought
into}, the strategy clearly is to grow to $200 million in
sales by aggregating mom-and-pop players. And we are looking
at the possibility of putting together a group of eight or
nine food-service distributors sprinkled across the country,
using a company in Boston and a company in San Francisco as
the beachhead investments and then making investments between
the two coasts.
   Keep in mind that our family investors aren't overly
concerned with an exit immediately after five years. These
families themselves have created wealth in business they've
controlled for 30 or 40 years. The horizon gets pushed out.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How will Legacy pay its bills in the meantime?
   A. Legacy generates income from a variety of sources, such
as advisory work for small businesses that don't want to sell
out but that do have a need to change. It also generates fees
from putting together transactions. It is not economically
viable for a large institution like Salomon Brothers to do a
$10 million deal, because its overhead is so huge. Legacy can
afford it. Our rent is $5,000 a month; we don't pay ourselves
exorbitant salaries. On a $10 million transaction, Legacy
could expect to get a $250,000 fee for putting the deal
together.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Legacy does deals, but it isn't actually a fund yet.
Why not?
   A. The first-time funds in today's market are having a
difficult time raising money: It's a chicken-and-egg problem.
That's the bad news. The good news is that with all the
wealth that's been created in families in the last three
decades, there's a tremendous amount of liquidity sloshing
around in these families. When Legacy finds a specific
transaction, there is no difficulty raising money to complete
the deal. When Legacy tries to raise a blind pool of capital,
there's a great deal of difficulty. Families that are
investing private wealth would rather direct it to a
particular situation than to a fund.
