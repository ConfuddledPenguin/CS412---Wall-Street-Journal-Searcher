   Berlitz International Inc. said second-quarter net rose
35%, despite difficulties in its Brazilian and German
operations.
   The Princeton, N.J., language-instruction company said net
income was $5.8 million, compared with $4.3 million in the
year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 11% to $61.9 million from
$55.9 million.

   Per-share net declined, however, to 15 cents, from 23
cents a year earlier, after providing for a preferred stock
dividend payment of $3 million. There were no preferred
dividends in 1989.
   Berlitz reported a slight decline in overall lesson
volume, as setbacks in Brazil and Germany offset volume
increases in almost all other countries. It cited the
Brazilian government's harsh new economic program and a
teachers strike in some of its German schools.
   For the six months, Berlitz reported a rise in net income
to $11.6 million from $7.6 million in the year-earlier
period. After providing for a preferred stock dividends of
$5.9 million, per-share net dropped to 30 cents, from 40
cents. Sales rose 17%, and lesson volume rose 5.6%.
   Berlitz was acquired in 1988 by Britain's Maxwell
Communication Corp., as part of Maxwell's acquisition of
Macmillan Inc., and a public offering was made last December.
Its shares closed yesterday at $17.125, unchanged, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
