   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose against all major currencies
on profit-taking, fears of a new military clash in the Middle
East and slowing price increases in the oil markets.
   Foreign exchange traders gingerly consolidated earlier
price movements, lifting the dollar across the board and
aiding the yen against Continental European currencies.
Dealings were kept edgy by the tense situation in the
Mideast.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has been considered a mixed
blessing for the dollar, but everything worked in the
currency's favor yesterday. Fears that a military clash would
send the world's safe-haven currency soaring ensured the
dollar was never wanting for buyers.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5875 marks, up from 1.5765 marks late Monday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 150.95 yen,
above 150.32 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was
trading at $1.8720, marginally below $1.8725 late Monday.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 150.27 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of
150.60 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
1.5880 marks; in Tokyo Tuesday, it closed at 1.5767 marks.
   Also lending support for the dollar was a deceleration in
the rise of crude oil prices. Until news reports hit the
market late in the New York session that U.S. troops were
moving into Saudi Arabia, profit-taking by commodity traders
had encouraged currency dealers to chalk up some gains of
their own from the dollar's decline Monday.
   The prospect that higher oil prices would pitch the U.S.
into recession had been the dark side of Iraqi adventurism
for the dollar. But by the end of trading yesterday, the
September benchmark crude oil contract was up only 26 cents a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $28.31 a
barrel.
   That helped slow declines in New York stock prices, which
ended mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down
5.70 points to 2710.64.
   Dollar dealers have tried to be especially nimble recently
and were ready to cast aside economic considerations at a
moment's notice.
   The dollar hit its peaks yesterday of 1.5870 marks and
1.3365 Swiss francs when rumors whirled through the market
that British Broadcasting Corp. reported Iraqi troops had
crossed into Saudi Arabia. The BBC denied making such a
report.
   Near the end of trading, news reports that U.S. troops
were moving into Saudi Arabia pushed the dollar near its
intraday peak of 151.10 yen reached much earlier at the
opening of Asian trading. Initially, the White House wouldn't
comment on any troop movements, but after the close of New
York trading, U.S. Defense Department sources confirmed it.
   Earlier, a U.S. State Department comment that Iraq was
improving its troop readiness along the Saudi border gave the
dollar a similar boost.
   "One moment everything seems like it's getting better. The
next moment it looks like it's blowing up," said Marc Cohen,
a New York vice president for corporate foreign exchange with
Fuji Bank. "There isn't a lot of strategic thinking going on.
Everyone is sort of trading on air. You take a position and
then hope that everyone will react right way to the next
headline."
   "I'm not really looking at currency rates," said Donald
Hubbard, a New York treasury officer with the U.K.'s Midland
Bank. "I'm just looking at the price of oil and the news
headlines."
   Mr. Hubbard said the Iraqi invasion has made the market
busier than it normally is in August and has also altered its
character. "It's a different type of trader that was in
(yesterday). The jobbers that come in for a few (small prices
moves) were a bit shell shocked by the big moves last week
and are on the sidelines. Now we're seeing more genuine
commercial flows."
   Commented a dollar dealer in Wellington, New Zealand: "The
market fundamentally would like to sell dollars, but it is so
nervous, it doesn't want to get too short. The trend is
really to stay out of the market because no one knows what's
going to happen next" in Kuwait.
   Lynn Tierney, a vice president at Shawmut Bank of Boston,
said talk in the North American morning that the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board would call an emergency meeting later in the
day to discuss looser credit helped pressure the dollar. The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York wouldn't comment on the
rumor.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $384.50, down 20 cents. Estimated volume
was a very heavy 6.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $384.95 an ounce.
