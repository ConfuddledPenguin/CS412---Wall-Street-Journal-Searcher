   Medical researchers warned that using niacin to reduce
high blood cholesterol levels could interfere with diabetics'
attempts to control their blood sugar levels.
   Niacin, widely sold and also known as nicotinic acid, is
one of the B complex of vitamins.

   For most diabetics with high cholesterol levels,
"nicotinic acid therapy must be used with caution or avoided
altogether," declared a report in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association from two nutrition scientists at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas.
   Doctors have known since the mid-1950s that large daily
doses of niacin can lower blood cholesterol levels. Because
it is so cheap, widely available and has few side effects,
niacin is one of the "first choice" cholesterol-lowering
drugs recommended by the federally backed National
Cholesterol Education Program. Niacin, which can be bought
without a prescription, also is recommended in many popular
controls on cholesterol levels.
   Niacin is recommended especially for people who have both
a high level of cholesterol and high levels of fats, or
triglycerides, in their bloodstreams, a group that includes
many diabetics.
   In their report, Drs. Abhimanyu Garg and Scott M. Grundy
said they asked 13 male diabetics with high cholesterol and
triglyceride levels to take high doses of niacin daily for
eight weeks. All the men had what is known as
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the kind of diabetes
that usually develops in adulthood when, for unknown reasons,
insulin from the pancreas gland is no longer sufficient to
control the amount of sugar circulating in the bloodstream.
One man was controlling his diabetes with diet while the
other 12 were using either insulin injections or an
anti-diabetic drug to hold down blood sugar levels.
   During the diabetics' stays in a research ward at a
veterans hospital, the researchers checked their cholesterol,
triglyceride and blood sugar levels before treatment, during
the eight weeks they were taking niacin and during an
eight-week "control" period when no niacin was taken.
   As expected, the niacin, at doses of 1,500 milligrams
three times a day, lowered the mean cholesterol level of the
13 volunteers by 24%. The mean level of LDL-cholesterol, the
"bad" form linked to heart disease, dropped 15% while the
HDL-cholesterol, the "good" kind that protects against heart
disease, rose 34%.
   But, the researchers reported, control of the patients'
diabetes deteriorated, with levels of blood sugar (glucose)
rising 16% while niacin was being taken. One patient
experienced a sharp rise in blood glucose levels that
increased doses of insulin failed to correct. Two other
patients had to reduce or stop their diabetes medications
because of a drop in blood sugar levels.
   Levels of uric acid in the blood rose in all 13 patients
while taking niacin, with two patients experiencing extremely
high uric acid levels. High uric acid levels often accompany
gout. Although none of the volunteers complained of gout,
niacin could increase the risk of such a disorder, the
researchers suggested.
   "Therefore, it can be argued that the benefits" of
lowering cholesterol levels in the diabetic patients with
niacin "may be counterbalanced" by a worsening of the blood
sugar control, Drs. Garg and Grundy wrote.
   The researchers suggested that doctors consider using
other cholesterol-lowering drugs in diabetics.
   The report was the second strike against niacin in recent
weeks. Earlier, doctors reported at least four cases of liver
damage occurring in patients who switched from conventional
niacin to large doses of new sustained-release tablets of the
vitamin. Three of the patients used the vitamin for lowering
cholesterol while a fourth used it for general good health.
