   CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc. said it was sued by a
Connecticut shareholder, Robert Elson, who alleged that the
bankrupt futures concern misled investors about its financial
condition when it went public in August 1988.
   The suit, filed in federal court here, seeks class-action
status and also names as defendants certain Stotler officers,
directors and the company's accounting firm, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand.

   Stotler was forced into bankruptcy Friday by creditors
after teetering on the brink of insolvency for weeks. The
company's fiscal decline and fall was triggered in early July
when regulators said its brokerage unit, Stotler &amp; Co.,
wasn't meeting industry capital requirements. The Chicago
Board of Trade disclosed that it had been closely monitoring
Stotler &amp; Co.'s capital level since late 1987.
   The suit alleges that Stotler Group disclosure documents
prepared in conjunction with the 1988 public stock offering
included materially false and misleading information about,
among other things, the compliance of Stotler &amp; Co. with
industry minimum capital requirements.
   Mr. Elson, whose suit seeks an unspecified amount of
monetary damages, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Stotler Group said in a statement that it would "defend
vigorously" against the suit.
   A Coopers &amp; Lybrand spokesman declined comment on the
suit.
