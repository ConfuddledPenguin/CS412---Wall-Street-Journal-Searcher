   TORONTO -- CAE Industries Ltd., a maker of aircraft
simulator systems and other electronic equipment, said its
CAE Electronics Ltd. unit received a contract, valued at
about 44 million Canadian dollars (US$38.3 million), to
supply two flight simulators for the A-340-200 aircraft to
Lufthansa German Airlines.
   The simulators, to be delivered to the West German carrier
in September 1992, bring to 12 the number of orders placed by
Lufthansa, CAE said. The A-340 planes are made by Airbus
Industrie, a European aircraft consortium based in France.
