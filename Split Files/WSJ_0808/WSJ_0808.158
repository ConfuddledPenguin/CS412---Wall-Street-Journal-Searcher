   WASHINGTON -- The growth in consumer credit slowed
substantially in June, the Federal Reserve Board reported,
edging up $463 million following a rise of $3.65 billion in
May.
   The June figure represents a 0.8% annual rate, compared
with a 6.1% rate in May.

   "Consumer spending is sluggish, so people are not
extending themselves as far as credit is concerned," said
Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail
Merchants Association. "I don't think credit is really going
to grow strongly."
   Revolving credit, which consists mainly of bank card and
retail-store accounts, rose $1.30 billion in June, trailing
May's $3.19 billion.
   Debt from the purchase of automobiles fell by $1.58
billion in June. Lending for mobile homes fell $85 million,
while the miscellaneous category, which includes cash loans
and certain retail financing contracts, increased by $827
million. As of June 30, consumer credit outstanding stood at
$724.95 billion.
   Economists say the figures indicate a wariness on the part
of consumers. David Meer, a senior vice president at DYG
Inc., thinks consumers are still cautious in the present
economic climate. "We're still predicting that overall in
this kind of consumer climate there will be a continuing
effort by consumers to control spending."
   Mr. Meer was "a little bit surprised" by the rise in
revolving credit, but cautioned against unwarranted optimism
over the figure, saying that the trend indicates that
consumers are unsure about the future. "People are trying to
come down from the binge of the 1980s," he said, adding: "The
overall outlook is a sober one."
   The figures are adjusted for changes in seasonal borrowing
habits.
