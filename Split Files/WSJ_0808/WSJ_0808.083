   Emerson Electric Co. said it plans to spin off to
shareholders its defense operations, which employ about 6,000
workers, because the units don't measure up to Emerson's
profit goals.
   The move is the latest sign that defense contractors are
in for a long period of hard times as weapons spending by the
U.S. and its allies slows in reaction to improved relations
with the Soviet Union. Other big contractors have been laying
off workers and consolidating operations as the Bush
administration and Congress search for ways to trim defense
outlays.

   Emerson over the past three years has cut 1,500 workers
from the defense operations.
   The units would be spun off as a single company, with
stock distributed to Emerson shareholders on a pro-rata
basis, the company said. Emerson declined to disclose further
details of the transaction.
   Separately, Emerson reported third-quarter profit rose
4.4% to $160.5 million, or 72 cents a share, on sales of
$1.98 billion. A year earlier, profit was $153.8 million, or
69 cents a share, on sales of $1.78 billion.
   The five Emerson defense units had combined fiscal 1989
sales of about $600 million, and combined pretax profits of
about $15 million, the company said.
   Emerson, which makes a broad line of industrial and
consumer products, had sales for the year ended Sept. 30 of
$7.1 billion and profit of $588 million, or $2.63 a share.
   J.J. Adorjan, an Emerson vice chairman who runs the
defense units and would head the spinoff, said of the
business: "It didn't meet Emerson's objectives any more." Mr.
Adorjan said over the past year Emerson had considered
keeping the units, forming a joint venture to own them or
selling them. It rejected a sale because of low prices for
defense contractors, and thought a spinoff was the best way
to preserve value for Emerson shareholders and also maintain
good relations with the government.
   Mr. Adorjan said the decision to jettison the defense
operations had nothing to do with Emerson's guilty plea in
May to charges of inflating cost proposals on some military
contracts. The company agreed to pay a $14 million fine as
part of the plea agreement.
   Emerson's stock fell 25 cents to close at $36 yesterday in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Mr. Adorjan said there are no layoffs expected as a result
of the spinoff, which Emerson expects to complete by Sept.
30. He said a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission outlining plans for the divestiture should be made
in the next few days.
   Financing has yet to be worked out. The new company would
need working capital, and Emerson wants to be paid a dividend
as part of the transaction.
   A name hasn't been chosen for the new company, which, like
Emerson, would be based in St. Louis. Mr. Adorjan said the
company would have equity of about $400 million. He wouldn't
project profits.
   The five units are: Electronics &amp; Space Corp., St. Louis;
Hazeltine Corp., Greenlawn, N.Y.; Rantec Microwave &
Electronics Inc., Calabasas, Calif.; Southwest Mobile Systems
Corp., St. Louis; and Vacco Industries, South El Monte,
Calif.
