   A little iconoclasm may be in order as Congress, alarmed
about rising oil imports and the political instability of the
Persian Gulf, pushes for a bigger Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. Now a 600-million-barrel store of crude oil, the $25
billion SPR rests in underground salt caverns in Texas and
Louisiana under the watchful eyes of Department of Energy
bureaucrats. It's doubtful whether the department will ever
release it. The crucial test may come soon if our embargo
against Iraqi oil takes hold.
   Oil is fungible. An oil crisis, whether caused by an
interruption in the supply network or a shortfall in world
production, will manifest itself as a price increase to oil
consumers everywhere. It is individual consumers -- not
nations -- who compete with each other by bidding up the
price. The world oil market "shares" an oil shortage by
allocating the available oil to all those willing to pay the
world price, no matter where they reside. Thus a cutoff of
oil from the Persian Gulf would soon hurt all consumers
equally, including Europeans and Japanese.

   It doesn't matter how much a country imports from the
Gulf, whether 5% or 50%, or whether it imports oil at all.
Absent local subsidies, all consumers will have to pay a
higher price. And it doesn't matter whether the supply
shortfall is caused by the producer or by the consumer. If
the U.S.-led oil embargo against Iraq is effective, prices
could reach the $40 level -- unless balanced by increased
production.
   Of course, the shortfall could also be balanced by
releases of oil from the SPR. The SPR can moderate a
short-lived price increase; but most of the other things said
about it are simply myths.
   Myth 1: An American-owned SPR benefits Americans. Not
quite. As oil moves from the SPR into U.S. refineries,
America needs to import less, and thus makes more oil
available to the rest of the world at a lower price. Oil
released from the U.S. SPR subsidizes foreign consumers by
reducing a world supply shortfall and thereby moderates a
global price increase.
   Myth 2: The SPR assures energy security in case of an
embargo directed at the U.S. This myth stems from the 1973
Arab oil "embargo" declaration, blamed at that time for
shortages of gasoline that were really due to price controls
and administrative misallocations; the embargo itself never
reduced imports. The U.S. would suffer from a world-wide
increase in the price of oil, but a selective embargo cannot
be effectively directed against the U.S. unless a naval
blockade physically interdicts oil shipments to this country
-- the reverse of what President Bush hopes to do to Iraq.
   The real security threat to the U.S. would not be a naval
blockade, but rather sabotage and terrorist attacks against
our oil refining and distribution system within the U.S. --
against which the SPR would be useless.
   Myth 3: Only a government SPR can cushion the U.S. against
supply shortfalls. As might have been anticipated, national
SPRs have reduced the incentives for private stockpiles.
Refiners can now rely on the taxpayer to pay the costs of
hoarding oil.
   Myth 4: The U.S. must store 90 days of imports. There's no
reason for this rule. The 90 day figure is reached by
outdated modelling, a hangover from the days when the SPR was
thought necessary to replace "lost imports" on a barrel for
barrel basis, rather than moderate price increases.
   Myth 5: The U.S. would not need to stockpile if it were
self-sufficient in energy. In a free oil market, oil
consumers everywhere pay the same price. If there must be a
world stockpiling system, even exporting countries, like
Great Britain and Norway, should develop stockpiles, in
proportion to their use -- not their imports -- of oil.
   Myth 6: Oil will be released from the SPR in the event of
an oil crisis. This is the biggest myth of all. There exists
no definition of what constitutes a crisis -- such as a
specified price increase on the world market. Through several
administrations the energy department has steadfastly refused
to spell out in advance what defines a crisis. Bureaucratic
incentives being what they are, there will always be
reluctance to release oil from the SPR. No one will blame a
prudent bureaucrat for saving the oil for a rainier day. And
in fact, in testimony yesterday to a congressional committee,
energy department official John Easton said that oil supplies
are at the highest level in nine years, and rebuffed
suggestions that it was now time for the administration to
tap the SPR.
   Myth 7: The agreement to share oil through the
International Energy Agency will protect the consuming
nations. The IEA was set up in Paris in 1974, based on the
facile idea that since OPEC is a cartel, consumers should
also form one. But the idea of oil sharing is either useless
or preposterous. What will be the price of the oil that is to
be shared? If it's the world price, then nobody needs the
IEA; the oil market provides an automatic sharing among those
willing to pay the price, without involving politics in the
allocation. If, on the other hand, the price is to be at the
(much lower) level existing before the supply crisis, then
countries giving up oil from their SPRs are subsidizing the
others.
   Myth 8: Releases from the SPRs must be coordinated by the
IEA countries. If coordination could be accomplished, it
could well reinforce a price swing, if the coordinating
authorities guessed wrong about which way and how fast prices
were moving. There is no advantage to coordination; countries
that happen to release their SPR oil near the price peak will
make money and can replace the oil later at a lower price.
Countries that don't release oil will miss the opportunity to
make money (except if the crisis persists); but their
citizens will benefit through lower prices no matter whose
oil is released.
   The best way to obtain the advantages of stockpiling, the
reduction of price peaks, would be to privatize at least part
of the SPR by selling options: "call" options that permit the
holder to buy oil at certain (high) strike prices, and "put"
options that require the SPR to buy oil from the holder at
certain (low) strike prices. The selling of options provides
income for the SPR; buying low and selling high can make it
profitable and promotes price stability.
   Beyond this, a publicly-owned SPR does have the benefit of
discouraging Congress from instituting price controls,
rationing or similar non-market allocation mechanisms out of
fear that speculators will profit from price swings.
   A February 1990 Energy department report to Congress
included a study on financing an expanded SPR. The report
recommends more of the same -- on-budget purchases of oil
from general revenues -- but opens up the option of
"leasing." To some extent the study was stimulated by the
idea that the U.S. could save money by leasing oil from Saudi
Arabia and storing it in the United States.
   A report dating to 1976, prepared for then-Secretary of
the Treasury William E. Simon, discusses a similar, but less
costly proposal. It points out that storing Saudi crude oil
in the U.S. would create a financial nest egg for them, out
of reach of their enemies, without in any way upsetting OPEC;
since the stored oil would not be marketed unless there were
a supply shortfall and a corresponding price increase. Iraq's
toppling of the Kuwaiti ruling family, lends even greater
relevance to this proposal.
   It makes sense for the U.S. government to permit the
Saudis, and others with excess production capacity, to enter
into private agreements with U.S. companies to store crude
oil here. They can produce, transport and store it at a cost
of a few dollars a barrel and sell it for a large multiple at
some future date of their choosing. All parties would benefit
from such privatized oil storage -- above all the U.S.,
because it would remove the need to expand or maintain a
large and costly government SPR, financed by taxpayers.
