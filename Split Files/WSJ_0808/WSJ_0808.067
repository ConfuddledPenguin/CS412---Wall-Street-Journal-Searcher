   TOKYO -- Japan, as all schoolchildren here are taught, is
a small island nation with few natural resources. So it has
become an axiom that this, of all the industrial countries,
is especially vulnerable to energy crises.
   But since Iraqi tanks roared across the Kuwaiti border
last Thursday, corporations and consumers here haven't seemed
terribly worried about their ability to cope with more
expensive oil. And, while stock and bond prices here have
plummeted along with other world markets, economists and
analysts say Japan could weather higher oil prices far more
comfortably than it did the two oil shocks of the 1970s --
thanks to energy conservation measures and industrial
restructuring during the past decade. Surprisingly, some say
the U.S. economy may well suffer more this time.

   "Interest rates would rise, and growth and profits would
fall in Japan if oil prices rose, but probably not by as much
as would be the case in the energy-wasteful U.S.," writes Jan
VanDenBerg, Tokyo-based economist for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, in a report issued Tuesday.
   "The Japanese economy is in very good shape, but I am
worried about the American economy," says Kazuaki Harada,
chief economist at Sanwa Bank's research institute. "The
negative impact coming from rising oil prices is much more
serious for the U.S. than Japan."
   The mood here is in stark contrast to the dark days of
1974, when many people feared a newly powerful cartel of
Middle East oil producers would bring Japan's industrial
machine to a grinding halt.
   There remains, of course, some risk that Japan's economy
could be hobbled by the crisis in the Middle East. Because
Japan depends on imported oil for most of its energy needs, a
supply disruption -- rather than price increases -- could be
crippling. A long period of sharply higher oil prices could
also take a heavy toll. And, with U.S. warships steaming
toward the Persian Gulf and oil prices quoted yesterday at as
much as $28 a barrel, that threat is growing less remote.
   Such a scenario "would cause a very big impact on the
Japanese economy as a whole," says Nobuyuki Ueda, an
economist at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. He says the
rise in oil prices so far justifies lowering his projection
for the rate of Japanese economic growth in the fiscal year
ending next March 31 to around 4.4% or 4.5%, down from 4.9%
now.
   A macroeconomic simulation released Tuesday by Daiwa
Securities Co.'s research affiliate shows real economic
growth of 3.5% for the fiscal year beginning next April,
assuming that oil prices average about $25 a barrel, utility
rates edge up and -- as many investors now believe likely --
Japan's central bank raises the official discount rate by
about 0.75%. That compares with the research institute's
previous forecast, issued July 9, that the economy would
expand by 4.1% for the fiscal year beginning in April.
   Still, given the resilience Japanese industry developed
during the previous oil crises and during the wrenching
revaluation of the yen in the late 1980s, companies here
stand to recover more quickly than their international
rivals, economists say.
   For one thing, Japanese industry has become more
energy-efficient than its international rivals. The U.S. uses
about 2.5 times as much energy per person for commercial use
as Japan, and West Germany about 1.5 times as much, according
to economists at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. Kenneth Courtis,
senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in Tokyo,
notes that the Japanese economy today produces 2.24 times the
real output for the same energy input as in 1973.
   A broad shift away from energy-intensive heavy industries
and development of other energy sources -- nuclear power now
accounts for about a quarter of Japan's energy -- have helped
reduce Japan's vulnerability to higher oil prices. So has a
buildup of petroleum reserves, which now amount to the
equivalent of 142 days' supply -- compared with an estimated
99 days for all members of the International Energy Agency,
according to Merrill Lynch. On Tuesday, Japan's minister of
international trade and industry said the government is
prepared to allow a "drastic decline" in the oil stockpile to
ease any shortage problems.
   Consider the case of Japan's steelmakers. While oil
accounted for 21.3% of their energy consumption in 1973, that
proportion had dropped to 14.2% by 1979 and has been less
than 7% since 1982, according to the Japan Iron &amp; Steel
Federation.
   For the nation as a whole, oil dropped from 77.4% of total
energy supplies in 1973 to 71.5% at the outbreak of the 1979
oil crisis and now stands at just under 58%.
   While each dollar-a-barrel increase in crude oil prices
will trim Japan's balance of payments surplus by $1.3 billion
a year, the same increase will add $2.9 billion to the U.S.
trade deficit, estimates Mr. Harada of Sanwa Bank. And while
a 10% increase in oil prices could be expected to boost
wholesale prices in Japan by 0.2 percentage point, the same
change would add 0.6 percentage point to U.S. producer
prices, he says.
