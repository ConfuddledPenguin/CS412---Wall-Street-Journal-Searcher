   TOKYO -- As Tokyo's battered stock market continues to
plummet, some analysts are finding reasons to be optimistic
in spite of -- and even because of -- the turmoil.
   They say the Tokyo market, ravaged by rumors of higher
interest rates and steeper oil prices resulting from Iraq's
blitzkrieg into Kuwait, still holds opportunities for careful
investors. The comeback may not happen next week or next
month. But many market watchers insist that given the
underlying strength of Japan's economy, stock prices are
bound to creep upward again before long.

   It may have been difficult for many investors to catch
sight of that vision Tuesday, though. A flurry of rumors
linked to Iraq's takeover of Kuwait pummeled the Nikkei Index
of 225 stocks to its lowest point since mid-1988. The Nikkei
tumbled 946.46 points, or 3.3%, to 27653.07 -- well below the
year's previous low of 28002.07, reached April 2 after a
three-month decline. Volume was moderate with about 500
million share changing hands, up from 350.4 million on
Monday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose
322.83 points to 27975.90.
   On Tuesday, bond prices also took a beating. In volatile
trading, the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bond slid
0.63 to 83.02 to yield 8.085%, up 0.145 point, the first time
the yield has risen above 8%.
   Tokyo's decline -- the stock market has fallen in 11 of
the past 12 sessions -- stunned some investors. "I can't
believe it -- it's incredibly low," gasped the research
director at a U.K. securities firm.
   The Nikkei plunged a hair-raising 1300 points within a
little more than an hour of the opening. The market staged a
small rally later after a statement by Finance Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto that Iraq's bid for power in the Persian
Gulf won't weaken the Japanese economy, but the gains were
quickly obliterated by renewed worries about the tension in
the Middle East.
   Some traders, though, are sketching a recovery from the
troubles. The traders already are referring to the current
crisis as the "Third Oil Shock," recalling the stock market
doldrums that accompanied the oil price jumps in 1973 and
1979. With the Nikkei Index rapidly retracing its tracks
through territory it most recently advanced through two years
ago, some experts are looking to 1973 for guidance.
   Then, the indicator fell 37% from the peak in early 1973
to the bottom in October 1974, before rebounding sharply.
Using that model, Mikio Fujino, an institutional salesman at
Nikko Securities Co., predicts that the current plunge will
halt when the Nikkei falls to 23000 to 24000 -- an additional
15% to 20% below current levels.
   "That's a big correction," he says. "But remember that the
Japanese economy recovered maybe the fastest in the world
from that shock, and the Japanese market followed." During
the 1990 first quarter, Japan's economy grew at an annualized
rate of 10.4% -- and its dependence on oil is far less than
during either of the first two oil scares. As a result, he
says, the market is likely to find solid footing for a rally.
   Mr. Fujino doesn't necessarily expect the recovery to
begin soon -- it could happen as late as next year -- but
he's urging clients to get into the market.
   More cautious analysts predict a gradual turnaround.
"Before last week, I would have said we were six months into
a nine-month bear market," says Bruce Johnson, head of
research at Baring Securities (Japan) Co. "Now I'd say the
Iraqi situation has pushed the prospects for recovery back
another nine months."
   While he's sure of a recovery, Mr. Johnson notes, "You
really can't guess the bottom under these kinds of
conditions."
   The difficulty of predicting stock performance in
uncertain times was illustrated by Tuesday's movement of
Arabian Oil Co., the biggest oil producing company in Japan.
Owned by some of Japan's biggest utilities, as well as the
Saudi and Kuwaiti governments, the company operates a large
oil field in the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.
   The company's share price fell steeply in the wake of
reports of Iraq's invasion, but climbed 200 yen Tuesday to
9300 yen ($1.33 to $61.92) on the hope that higher oil prices
would benefit the company as long as it was allowed to
continue production. Arabian Oil would be a big loser,
though, if Iraq attempted to move troops into Saudi Arabia.
Any resurgence of fears of a conflict will drive the
company's share price lower again, analysts say.
   "This has become a market driven by rumor," laments
Toshiyuki Nishimura, deputy general manager of Yamaichi
Securities' international business department. "Stock prices
dropped a long way {Tuesday}, but they could come back
{today}. It all depends on the latest news from the Middle
East."
   Meanwhile, the Frankfurt market gained 1.7% after toppling
5.4% Monday, while London's gain was under 1% following
Monday's 2.8% decline. Both markets finished well off
intraday highs, an indication, traders said, that the rallies
weren't firmly based.
   "I'd like to think this is the bottom, but with the
situation in the gulf, anything could happen," said John K.
Thomson, senior investment manager at Edinburgh-based
Standard Life Assurance Co.
   Frankfurt's DAX Index gained 29.37 points to 1770.30 after
reaching 1799.18 earlier in the day. London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index rose 15.6 to 2235.8.
Although ahead by 40.7 points two hours before trading ended,
the London index slipped as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
in New York turned into negative territory.
   The markets, groping for hopeful news, had perked up in
midmorning on a report from Jordan that Iraq would let
foreign nationals leave. But traders soon looked beyond that
to more basic problems. "Hussein may let the foreigners go,
but some people forget what he's done to Kuwait -- there's
still a lot of uncertainty out there," said David Smith, who
heads trading in non-U.S. equities at Jefferies &amp; Co. in
London.
   Many money managers are preparing for a long period of
uncertainty and volatility. Mr. Thomson said that Standard
Life, Britain's largest mutual insurer with #21 billion
($39.3 billion) under management, will be "sitting and
watching" for the next few weeks. "With yields at 5% and a
price-earnings ratio of under 11, the {London} market is
attractive for the long-term investor," he said. "But
short-term the market is very volatile."
   Added Mick Brewis, an investment manager at Baillie
Gifford &amp; Co. in Edinburgh: "I'm quite suspicious of
{Tuesday's} rebound. We're still taking a very cautious view.
Even if tension does ease, we don't think the price of oil
will come back much. It will remain fairly high, with
consequences for world inflation and world growth."
   Mr. Brewis said that Baillie Gifford isn't planning much
buying or selling short-term, although the firm did buy more
British Petroleum yesterday.
   In Frankfurt, the small rally was sparked by moderate
retail buying. "Many private individuals saw a good chance to
buy stocks at relatively low levels," said Peter Pietsch, a
Commerzbank AG economist.
   Several of Monday's big losers made modest comebacks. In
London, Rothmans rose 31 pence to 768 pence, Reuters was up
14 pence to 969 pence, and Glaxo gained 13 pence to 775
pence.
   In Frankfurt, Daimler-Benz closed at 781 marks, up 9.50
marks ($495, up $6.02); Deutsche Bank rose 13 marks to 768
marks; and Siemens gained 14.50 marks to 702.50 marks.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Paris, Zurich,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Oslo and Madrid, mixed in Brussels, and
lower in Helsinki and Milan. South African gold stocks closed
narrowly mixed.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Taipei, Singapore, Hong Kong,
Seoul and Manila, and were little changed in Sydney and
Wellington.

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
