   NEW YORK -- The bond market was whipsawed in extremely
volatile trading yesterday, falling on rumors of escalating
tensions in the Middle East and rising on bargain hunting.
   "This was a whiplash type of day," said Charles Lieberman,
a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
"We were strapped to our seats."

   The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which
surged nearly 3/4 point and then tumbled one point, ended 1/2
point lower. That translates into a loss of $5 for a bond
with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield ended at 8.86%,
up from 8.80% on Monday.
   Trading activity was so tumultuous that investors were too
nervous to bid on the Treasury's $11.5 billion of three-year
notes that were auctioned yesterday afternoon. The
disappointing sale, which kicked off the Treasury's huge
$32.25 billion quarterly refunding of the federal debt, was
viewed as an indication that the next two legs of the auction
will also fare poorly.
   "The market was overwhelmed by the political news of the
day," said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson
Lehman Government Securities Inc. He said that investors are
reluctant to buy securities "when political news can have
such a dramatic affect on the market," he said.
   The new three-year notes were auctioned at an average
yield of 8.10%. But shortly after the auction results were
released the yield was nearly 8.20%. It ended at 8.14%. When
yields on new securities trade higher than the average
auction yield, that is a sign that dealers are slashing
prices and raising yields in an effort to attract buyers.
Typically, such actions are indicative of a poor auction.
   Prices of other short-term securities -- which have surged
recently on expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon
cut interest rates -- ended 1/8 point lower yesterday.
   Traders said that sellers of the securities were
disappointed that the Federal Reserve has not yet made its
move. "People have given up the ghost on the Fed easing,"
said one analyst.
   In early trading, Treasury bond prices posted strong gains
as institutional money managers and other bargain hunters
went on a buying spree. Many of these investors were lured by
what they considered attractive yields and prices. (The yield
on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond surged to 8.80% on
Monday as its price plunged 2 5/8 points, or $26.25 for a
bond with a $1,000 face amount.)
   Bond prices skidded sharply yesterday afternoon when a
rumor shot through bond and foreign exchange markets that the
British Broadcasting Corp. had reported that Iraq moved
troops into Saudi Arabia.
   The market rallied briefly after the BBC denied the rumor,
and then headed lower again when news organizations reported
that the U.S. was moving combat aircraft and ground support
troops to Saudi Arabia to deter Iraq strongman Saddam Hussein
from launching an attack against the oil-rich kingdom.
   Although many investment accounts bought bonds yesterday
morning, most of yesterday's trading was dominated by big
bond dealers trading for their own account.
   "It was strictly a game for speculators and even some of
them stepped away because the market was too volatile," said
Mr. Lieberman. "You can't anticipate the next political
developments coming out of the Middle East."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The prospect of sharply higher oil prices as a result of
Iraq's conquest of Kuwait and its menacing tone toward Saudi
Arabia has made fixed-income investing so treacherous that
most would-be buyers are keeping far from the field of play.
   That was evident in yesterday's three-year Treasury note
auction. So-called "noncompetitive bids," often seen as a
gauge of individual investor interest, amounted to just $973
million of the $11.5 billion of notes sold. That compares
with noncompetitive bids of $2.45 billion at the May auction
and $1.19 billion in February refunding.
   In trading yesterday, the price of the benchmark 30-year
bond ended at 98 23/32, down from 99 10/32 on Monday. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, rose to 8.86% from 8.80%.
   Short-term rates were slightly higher. The average
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.30% for
a bond-equivalent yield of 7.52% while the rate for six-month
notes rose to 7.28% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.64%. At
Monday's Treasury bill auction, the average discount rate was
7.23% on three-month bills and 7.19% on six-month bills.
   Here are details of yesterday's three-year note auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
                                                                                                       

                       3-Year Notes

   The notes are dated Aug. 15 and mature Aug. 15, 1993.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk-bond prices followed the movement in the broader bond
market, rising and falling on news developments.
   "The market continues to be ruled by supply and demand,
and supply and demand is being governed by the market's
psychological perception of what's happening in the Middle
East," said David Feinman, a junk-bond trader at Los
Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co.
   Prices of most junk bonds, speculative-grade securities
with low credit ratings or no credit ratings, finished the
day about 1/4 point higher.
   High-yield market participants said recession-resistant
securities like supermarket issues managed to outperform the
broader junk-bond market.
   Kroger Co.'s 13 1/8% subordinated debentures due 2001
ended up 1/2 point at 102 1/4; Safeway Stores Inc.'s 12%
subordinated debentures due in 1998 finished up 3/4 point at
100.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were 1/8 to 3/8 point lower as the market
reacted to the situation in the Mideast.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 were off 1/8 point at 97 3/4 to
yield 7.38%.
   "It's pretty ugly. They've hammered the market pretty
badly," following the U.S. troop rumors, one New York trader
said.
   It is difficult to determine when the market will reach a
bottom, as investors are unwilling to step up and buy bonds,
he added. "Nobody wants to roll the dice."
   Ahead on the calendar, the Port Authority of New York &amp;
New Jersey will sell $100 million of consolidated bonds via
competitive today.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities again followed the Treasury market
lower on the Mideast turmoil and oil-driven inflation
worries.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were 1/2 point
weaker on the day at 98 10/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 98 10/32 and Federal
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were down 1/32 at
98 27/32.
   In primary market activity, pricing details of two new
offerings were announced.
   A $300 million issue of Fannie Mae real estate mortgage
investment conduit securities was offered by Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets. The securities are collateralized with 10%
Fannie Mae 30-year securities.
   In other sectors, in a deal being classified as an
underwritten federal agency offering, an $81.02 million issue
of U.S. Government Guaranteed Notes was priced at par to
yield from 8% to 9.25% through Salomon Brothers Inc.
   The securities, guaranteed by the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, are noncallable and mature each August 1
from 1991 to 2005.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Most major foreign bond markets recovered from Monday's
sell-off, as investors began to view recent price declines as
sufficient to offset rising inflation expectations.
   Bond markets around the world have been reeling since last
Thursday when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The turmoil pushed prices
of oil sharply higher and prompted speculation that inflation
is heating up.
   But now, "some {investors} are deciding that the market
has already discounted the worst of the news," said one
London trader. "Whether they're right, I don't know."
   Bond prices ended higher in West Germany, Britain, France
and several other markets yesterday.
   The major exception was Japan, where government bonds
continued to deteriorate. Although some arbitrage buying in
the afternoon helped pull prices off the lows of the day,
bonds still posted big losses.
   Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond ended at a price of
83.04, down 0.56 point, to yield 8.08%. The yield had been as
high as 8.22%. (When calculated using the semi-annual
compound measure, the yield on the No. 119 closed at 7.44%
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
