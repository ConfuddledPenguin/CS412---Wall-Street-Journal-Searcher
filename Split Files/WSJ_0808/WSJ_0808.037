   WALL, N.J. -- New Jersey Natural Gas Co. said it filed
with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for a $14.8
million, or 4.5%, rate increase to cover higher operating
costs, financing and capital construction expenses.
   At the same time, the utility said it expects to issue a
$14.5 million refund to customers toward the end of the year,
because of a refund it expects to receive from a natural gas
supplier.
