   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. reported a
second-quarter net loss of $23 million, or 39 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier net loss of $42.6 million, or 84
cents a share.
   The publishing and insurance concern, which is shouldering
a heavy debt load stemming from a 1987 recapitalization
program, attributed the improvement to a reduction in
interest and other expenses, as well as higher revenue.

   Harcourt said that largely because it used proceeds from
the sale of its theme parks to pare debt, interest expense
dropped to $66 million in the latest quarter, compared with
$91.6 million a year ago. First-half interest expense fell to
$124.1 million from $179 million a year earlier.
   In the 1989 second quarter, Harcourt had a loss from
continuing operations of $70.1 million, or $1.21 a share, and
a profit from discontinued operations of $27.5 million, or 37
cents a share. Revenue rose 6% to $348.5 million from $328.6
million.
   Robert E. Evanson, executive vice president, said that the
third quarter -- traditionally the most important for the
publishing business -- should prove to be the most
significant for Harcourt this year. "It's nice to be going
into the busy season ahead of schedule, but the important
quarter is right now -- this will be the key quarter," Mr.
Evanson said.
   For the six months, Harcourt reported a net loss of $94.9
million, or $1.47 a share, compared with a loss from
continuing operations of $167.7 million, or $2.77 a share, a
year earlier.
   For the year-earlier six months, income from discontinued
operations of $9 million brought the net loss to $158.7
million, or $2.64 a share.
   Revenue rose 9.7% to $625.4 million from $570.2 million.
