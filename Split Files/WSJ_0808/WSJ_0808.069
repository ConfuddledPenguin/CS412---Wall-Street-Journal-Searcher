   Epitope Inc. said the Food and Drug Administration
approved its application to begin human clinical trials on a
saliva-based AIDS diagnostic test.
   Epitope said preclinical trials show the test to be as
accurate as blood tests taken to detect the AIDS virus. The
clinical trials, expected to last for nine months, will be
conducted in hospitals, laboratories, medical centers and
dental schools in San Francisco; Tampa, Fla.; Portland, Ore.;
New York; and Chicago.
