   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s computer unit
received an extension of an estimated $100 million order for
personal computers from American Airlines' Sabre Travel
Information Network. American Airlines is a unit of AMR Corp.
   No value was placed on the extension, which follows a June
1989 contract for personal computers to be used in the Sabre
network in the U.S.

   An American Airlines spokeswoman said AT&amp;T Computer
Systems will need to convince some 4,500 overseas travel
offices that currently use older Sabre equipment to change to
newer AT&amp;T personal computers.
