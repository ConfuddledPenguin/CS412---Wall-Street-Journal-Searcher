   WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration extended for four years a contract with
Rockwell International Corp. to conduct tests to improve the
safety and performance of the space shuttle's main engines.
   Under an $819.8 million contract extension, the company's
Rocketdyne Division will conduct an extensive test program
designed to improve the engines' high-pressure turbopumps and
other features.

   Each shuttle carries three reusable engines, which burn a
mixture of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.
They are fired for about eight minutes as the shuttle ascends
into orbit. In addition, the shuttle's two solid-fuel booster
rockets burn during the first two minutes of flight.
