   The former owner and three ex-officers of the defunct
Lamar Savings Association of Austin, Texas, were indicted on
federal criminal charges related to the alleged
misapplication of $121.1 million of thrift funds.
   Former owner Stanley E. Adams Jr., who once sought
permission to open a Lamar Savings branch on the moon, was
named in all 14 counts of the indictment.

   The indictment, returned late yesterday by a federal grand
jury in Austin, also charged former Lamar Savings officers
Milton R. Perry and Reuben Coleman, both of Austin, and
Frederick Scheibe of San Antonio.
   The indictment is the latest in the Justice Department's
stepped-up effort to prosecute the people believed most
responsible for the billions of dollars in losses at the
nation's thrifts. The crackdown so far has been focused
primarily on Texas S&amp;Ls.
   Lamar Savings collapsed in late 1985 after having
ballooned to become the 12thlargest thrift in Texas. The
thrift, which had about $2 billion in assets when it failed,
fueled its growth by offering some of the highest rates of
interest available in the U.S. for deposits, which drew
millions of dollars to the institution. The deposits were
used to finance real-estate ventures that later soured.
   The indictment accuses Mr. Adams and the three former
officers of conspiring to conceal Lamar Savings' troubled
financial condition from federal thrift regulators. As part
of those efforts, the indict ment alleges, the thrift
officials would arrange for borrowers to sign up for "sham
loans" to finance purchases of repossessed real estate from
the thrift's portfolio. The borrowers, in many instances,
weren't required to repay the loans, but the thrift was able
to book immediate gains for making the loans and for
"selling" troubled real estate, according to the indictment.
   Two Lamar Savings borrowers, real estate developers Louis
G. Reese III and Robert Hayden Brown, both of Dallas, were
each indicted on conspiracy and five other charges. Mr. Reese
was a borrower at several now-failed Texas thrifts, including
Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas and Western Savings
Association.
   Mr. Reese's attorney, William M. Ravkind of Dallas, said
his client was forced to take on the loans for Lamar's
repossessed real estate in order to obtain financing for his
own real-estate projects. Mr. Brown's attorney couldn't be
reached for comment.
   None of the three former officers could be reached for
comment.
   The indictment of Mr. Adams had been expected for several
weeks, mainly because of an unusual public-relations campaign
by Mr. Adams himself.
   Beginning in mid-May, an Austin public-relations operative
retained by Mr. Adams arranged news conferences to needle
federal investigators for overlooking alleged wrongdoing by
Lamar borrowers and others; the operative, Garry Entress, was
subpoenaed to appear before the federal grand jury hearing
evidence in the case.
   Yesterday, the Justice Department issued a news release in
Washington, D.C., before Mr. Adams's attorney, David Botsford
of Austin, was informed of the indictment.
   Mr. Botsford said he couldn't comment on the specific
charges because he hadn't seen the indictment, but said he
would "be very surprised if that indictment alleges that
Stanley Adams profited by one dime from any of these alleged
crimes."
   "He gave his heart, soul and resources to that
institution," the attorney said, adding: "I rather suspect
that Mr. Adams has been singled out for selective prosecution
for his reputation in the industry as a maverick."
   Mr. Botsford was referring to Mr. Adams's celebrated
application to federal thrift regulators for permission to
open a Lamar Savings branch on the moon, going so far as to
name a specific crater where the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration had indicated it would build a space
station.
   Federal thrift regulators didn't act on the application.
