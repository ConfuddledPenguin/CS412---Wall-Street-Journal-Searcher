   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it started up an
industrial nylon fiber plant in Izmit, Turkey, under a 50-50
joint venture with Sabanci Group, a Turkish industrial
company.
   The facility is part of Du Pont's plan to double its
business in Europe by the mid-1990s. With a capacity of 50
million pounds a year, the plant will produce nylon 6,6 for
tire reinforcement and other industrial applications.
Commercial shipments to Europe and the Middle East are
scheduled to begin in mid-August.
