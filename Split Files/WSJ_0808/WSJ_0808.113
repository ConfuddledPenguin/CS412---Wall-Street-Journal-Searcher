   DENVER -- Tele-Communications Inc. said it hopes to
complete a restructuring by the first quarter of 1991 that
would put most of its cable television and programming
interests in a new company, Liberty Media Corp.
   As reported, Tele-Communications earlier this year said it
planned a major restructuring, but uncertainty in the
regulatory environment and difficulties in getting needed
consents have delayed the plan's implementation.

   In March, the company said it was considering a rights
offering to holders, which would entitle them to exchange a
portion of their shares in Tele-Communications Class A and
Class B common stock for shares of a new company, Liberty
Media Corp.
   Yesterday at the company's annual meeting,
Tele-Communications President John Malone said that directors
hadn't yet determined the definitive structure of Liberty
because, among other things, a number of tax and valuation
issues have to be resolved.
   Mr. Malone said that, under the plan, the company's
investment interest, generally 50% or less, in 18 affiliated
entities would be transferred to Liberty. The program
investments include stakes in American Movie Classics, The
Discovery Channel, QVC Networks and The Family Channel, but
exclude Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   Tele-Communications is eager to keep its 22% stake in
Turner under control of the original company.
