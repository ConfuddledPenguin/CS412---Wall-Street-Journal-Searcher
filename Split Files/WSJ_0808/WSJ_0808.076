   Stockholders who thought of themselves as "buy-and-hold"
investors are finding their determination sorely tested.
   When prices were mostly rising, it was easy to believe in
holding stocks through thick and thin. After all, investors
who rode out the market's ups and downs over the past several
decades got average annual returns of about 10% -- trouncing
alternative investments such as bonds.

   But now, hanging on to stocks is starting to feel
foolhardy to people who suspect the drop over the past few
days is the beginning of a long slide. The temptation is "to
panic and pull out -- that's human nature," says James L.
Joslin, president of TFC Financial Management, a Boston
advisory firm.
   What to do?
   Financial advisers such as Mr. Joslin say there are
reasons individuals shouldn't be too quick to jump the
buy-and-hold ship. At the same time, they say this is a good
opportunity for investors to review their stock holdings in
light of their overall portfolios and investment goals.
Investors who decide they do want to sell should do it in a
measured and carefully planned way, financial advisers say.
   For instance, Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis
with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, says investors
shouldn't pull out any more than 25% of the money they've
committed to stocks for the long haul.
   Hugh R. Lamle, executive vice president with M.D. Sass
Investors Services Inc., a New York money manager, says
investors who decide to sell now should have a clearly
thought-out "entrance strategy" on when they will buy in
again. "They should assure themselves they will get back in
and not just park that money on the sidelines indefinitely,"
he says.
   It's natural, after everything that has happened in the
past few days, to wonder if stocks are really worth the
aggravation. But a look at the long-term track record
suggests that the answer is yes: Over the 64 years from 1926
through 1989, stocks as measured by the Standard and Poor's
500-stock index delivered an average total return of 10.3% a
year, including price changes and dividends, according to
Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago research firm. By comparison,
long-term corporate bonds returned an average of 5.2% a year,
and U.S. Treasury bills, an average of 3.6%.
   Stock returns did fluctuate much more than the returns on
other investments, though. In fact, stock investors had
losses in 19 of the 64 years.
   That's why people are sometimes tempted to try to "time"
the market, or move in and out of stocks in accordance with
their views on where the market is headed. Unfortunately,
many markettimers get it wrong, often selling only after
stock prices have already fallen considerably. And even when
they do get out at the right time, they may fritter away the
advantage by missing the best chance to get back in.
   "They don't ring a bell at the top, and they don't ring a
bell at the bottom," says Timothy C. Medley, a Jackson,
Miss., money manager. "It's very difficult to dance in and
out."
   Advisers such as Mr. Medley say the more reliable strategy
for individuals is to let time be their ally and to venture
into the stock market only with funds that can remain there
for perhaps five years. In other words, don't invest in
stocks with money that's supposed to pay for college tuition
two years from now.
   Investors who held stocks for five years at a time would
have lost money in only seven of the 60 rolling five-year
periods since 1926, according to Ibbotson. And four of those
seven were periods that encompassed the Crash of 1929.
   Stocks should be only part of a diversified portfolio, of
course. And advisers say individuals should try to focus on
their overall portfolio return rather than on what's
happening in each sector. Investors who can't live
financially or emotionally with what has happened to the
value of their portfolios because of the recent stockmarket
decline have too much invested in stocks and should cut back,
Mr. Lamle of M.D. Sass suggests.
   Many professional investors also vary the proportions of
their portfolios invested in stocks, in bonds and in cash
equivalents such as Treasury bills, in line with their
interpretation of the investment climate. But even they don't
always get it right.
   For example, David Drucker, a Bethesda, Md., financial
adviser, says he has been recommending for about three years
that investors allocate only about 15% of their portfolios to
U.S. stocks, down from 30% to 40% in some earlier periods.
Yet the S&amp;P 500 index ended up posting doubledigit gains in
both 1988 and 1989. "We expected to see a recession earlier
than we are getting one," Mr. Drucker explains.
   The big imponderable, after the latest sharp stock-price
declines, is whether it makes sense for an investor who
didn't get out earlier to sell now. While no one can really
answer that question, investment advisers point out that all
stocks won't behave the same way, no matter what happens in
coming weeks. Thus, they say, investors should comb through
their portfolios carefully, stock by stock.
   Gerald Perritt, a Chicago money manager and newsletter
writer, has been urging investors to cut back for months. He
says he thinks this is the beginning of a bear market. Still,
Mr. Perritt says he would be hesitant to sell some
high-quality stocks now that they have already fallen so
much.
   "If you are holding {Walt} Disney today at $103, you've
already taken a 25% hit from its high," he says. He suspects
that could end up being "the lion's share" of the stock's
decline. Disney rose $1 yesterday to end at $103.375 a share
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   In fact, Mr. Perritt is already starting to think about
increasing his stock holdings. For instance, he is hoping to
pick up shares of Browning-Ferris Industries, a big
waste-management firm, at prices of $35 or less. The stock
has fallen quite a bit from a recent high of $49, though it
rebounded $1.125 a share yesterday, closing at $38.75 in Big
Board composite trading.
