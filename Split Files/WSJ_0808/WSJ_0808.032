   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it will add Pep
Boys Manny, Moe &amp; Jack, a Philadelphia-based retailer of
automotive parts and accessories, to its stock index of 500
companies.
   S&amp;P said General Instrument Corp., a New York
communications equipment and electronic components
manufacturer, will be deleted from the list because it is
being acquired by Forstmann Little &amp; Co. The change will
occur at the close of trading Monday, S&amp;P said.
