   CHICAGO -- Quaker Oats Co., citing rising marketing costs,
said it expects to report lower earnings from continuing
operations for the fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 30.
   The grocery-products company said profit will be lower
than the 49 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter, partly
because Quaker plans to beef up European marketing of its
star product, Gatorade. Results in the year-earlier quarter
also were boosted by unusually strong results in Brazil, a
spokesman said.

   For the fourth quarter ended June 30, the company posted
net income of $66.3 million, or 86 cents a share, consisting
of a profit from continuing operations of $100.7 million, or
$1.31 a share, and a loss from discontinued operations of
$34.4 million, or 45 cents a share. The loss from
discontinued operations, from its Fisher-Price toy business,
was twice as high as the company had predicted.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose 4% to $1.4 billion.
   In the fourth quarter ended June 30, 1989, Quaker had net
from continuing operations of $40.8 million, or 52 cents a
share. Net from discontinued operations of $15.7 million, or
19 cents a share, made net income $56.5 million, or 71 cents
a share.
   Quaker took a $59.9 million loss on the discontinued toy
unit in fiscal 1990. It hopes to spin off the unit as a
separate company to shareholders by early next year.
   Officials said fiscal 1990 results came in "below
expectations" because of sluggish sales in its U.S. grocery
business. Domestic grocery-product sales were flat at $3.6
billion.
   The company blamed intense competition in its domestic
cereal and pet food lines, cool weather last summer which
impeded Gatorade sales, and a sudden drop in demand for
oat-bran products. Unit volume fell 6% as declines in its pet
foods, hot and ready-to-eat cereals, and Golden Grain lines
offset gains in its Gatorade, Aunt Jemima syrup and
food-service businesses.
   Overall, sales from continuing operations in fiscal 1990
were $5.03 billion, up 3% from fiscal 1989.
   Slightly higher margins helped boost operating income, as
the company focused its merchandising might on higher-margin,
higher-growth products, while trimming costs in mature lines.
Overhead expenses were also reduced.
   Internationally, Quaker's grocery products operations,
which posted record sales and operating earnings, were aided
by the reversal of a previous charge for plant consolidations
in Europe. The company last year took a $20.7 million
restructuring charge because of plans to close older plants
in West Germany and the Netherlands and build a new one. Upon
reflection, the company decided to save costs by keeping the
older plants open instead of building the new one.
