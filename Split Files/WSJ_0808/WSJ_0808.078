   NEW YORK -- Centaur Partners Group won three seats on the
board of National Intergroup Inc., unseating Chairman Howard
M. Love.
   Elected to the board were Melvyn J. Estrin, a principal of
Centaur; Robert J. Slater, former vice chairman of Crane Co.;
and William G. Tull, former president of American Security
Bank. Centaur said its slate received two-thirds of the
shares cast at National Intergroup's meeting July 25.

   A spokeswoman for National Intergroup said that the
results of the preliminary count, reported by Centaur,
corresponds with their tally. The company had no further
comment.
   Centaur also said that three of its governance resolutions
were approved by between 65% and 70% of shareholders. Those
resolutions provide for confidential voting by stockholders,
prevent the board from lowering the trigger of the company's
shareholder-rights plan below 20% and require a majority of
stockholders' approval of any golden-parachute plans for
management.
