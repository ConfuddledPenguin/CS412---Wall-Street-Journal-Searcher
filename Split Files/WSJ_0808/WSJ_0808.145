   U.S. coal producers, after a troubled decade, could make a
comeback in the wake of the Iraqi oil crisis.
   Coal sales and prices in export markets, especially in
Japan and Europe, are likely to increase if oil prices
continue to climb sharply. U.S. coal prices would then inch
up slowly, but only if world crude oil prices were to remain
high.

   The possibility of a return to good times follows a rough
decade in which an oversupply of coal led to depressed
prices, massive layoffs and mine closings throughout the
coalfields. Still, industry executives, who have had their
hopes for a coal revival dashed before, remain cautious.
"Those of us who've been around want to see what's real and
sustainable," says Gene Samples, president and chief
executive officer of Arch Mineral Corp. in St. Louis.
   Despite the caution, industry leaders are assessing how
fast they could increase production if spot market coal
prices climb or international orders increase further.
   Westmoreland Coal Co., Philadelphia, says it could boost
production to about 13 million tons from its current 10.8
million tons a year, if demand from the spot market picks up,
says E.B. Leisenring Jr., Westmoreland's chairman. "We could
do that with very little capital investment," he notes.
Instead, extra shifts would be added at its Virginia and West
Virginia mines.
   No decision has been made because the company, like
others, is waiting to see what happens in the Middle East.
"If profitability appears on the horizon, and it looks like
it will stay, people are very sanguine about going ahead," he
says. "We'll see people in the coal business encouraged to
spend capital for a change."
   Producers' spending plans depend on what buyers do in the
market. A green light would be if buyers choose the stability
of long-term contracts over purchases from the spot market,
the first place where a price jump would occur. Prices vary
based on the type of coal and other factors, but spot prices
for a ton of low-sulfur coal are about $24 to $27. Long-term
contract prices are $25 to $28.
   "There's going to be an impact," says Richard L. Lawson,
president of the National Coal Association, an industry trade
group. Export prices, for instance, will climb about $3 a ton
in the months ahead, he predicts.
   "Japan and Europe can switch between oil and coal, so the
export markets are likely to tighten up," says Daniel Roling,
energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Exporters --
such as Westmoreland, Pittston Co., Ashland Coal Inc. and
others -- would be the first to benefit from the oil shock.
   U.S. export sales had been expected to rise in coming
months, regardless of the oil crisis, because government
subsidies on mines in Germany and elsewhere are expected to
be reduced, making U.S. coal more competitive with coal from
Europe and elsewhere.
   In the U.S., prices don't fluctuate as quickly, because
coal and oil don't compete that much. About 75% of the one
billion tons of coal produced this year in the U.S. will be
purchased by U.S. power plants. Oil is used to produce only
about 5% of the nation's electricity, while coal accounts for
about 55%. Nuclear power and natural gas make up the rest.
   Many U.S. utilities don't have the ability to switch
between fuels. Those that can switch only "will change when
economics get strong enough," Mr. Leisenring says. No one
agrees on what the price of oil would have to be to make coal
more attractive.
   If demand does pick up, the coal industry is in a lot
better shape than it was during previous oil shocks.
Production has soared from 440 million tons in 1973, Mr.
Lawson said. Productivity has increased at about 6% a year,
as more mines have been mechanized and fewer miners are
needed to dig coal. There also are fewer and more powerful
players in the industry that are less likely to rush with
expansion plans unless there's proof demand is sustainable.
   After the oil shocks of the 1970s, oil companies and
others rushed in and bought up vast coal reserves as a hedge.
With more players in the market, coal production increased in
the early 1980s, without any spike in demand, depressing
prices. "That's less likely to happen this time," Mr. Sample
says, because fewer companies will rush to expand. Currently,
less than 20% of the production comes from independent coal
companies, while the rest comes from mines owned by oil, gas,
chemical and other companies.
   Another result of the oil crisis could be a slowdown in
passage of a tougher Clean Air Act, which is pending in
Congress. The legislation would limit emissions from
coal-fired power plants and make coal more expensive for
utilities.
   In recent meetings at the White House, Mr. Lawson said he
has cautioned officials that those environmental policies,
along with possible energy taxes and the prospect of
increased oil prices, could be too much at once. "It would
tie a pretty big tag around the energy industry," he says.
"I'm not sure the economy can swallow that right now."
