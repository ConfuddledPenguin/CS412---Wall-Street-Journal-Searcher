   Christopher de Vinck has hit the nail right on the head in
asserting that real books should be at the core of education
reform (editorial page, July 9). Books do so much more than
just tell a story: They improve vocabulary, grammar skills
and writing proficiency simply by providing a good example.
Plus, books stimulate the imagination and provoke thought,
and critical thinking is the essence of a good education.
Real books, then, must be the foundation of learning.
   The question I have, then, is why did we get away from
using real books in the first place? Literature worked just
fine for hundreds of years. It seems the "blue-ribbon
conferences" and the so-called experts that set out to
"improve" education have done just the opposite. They forgot
a fundamental rule of life: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
The problem was not in the curriculum -- the problem was, and
still is, in the administration of education. A tenure system
that prevents underperforming teachers from being fired, the
practice of promoting students who fail to meet even basic
scholastic requirements, and the continued use of the
nine-month school year, an anachronism from the Farm Age --
these are the problems that need to be addressed. Solve them,
and education will improve dramatically.
