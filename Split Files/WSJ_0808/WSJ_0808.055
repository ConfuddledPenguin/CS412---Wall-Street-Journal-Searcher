   NEW YORK -- Another big financial institution resigned as
a primary dealer of U.S. securities, citing declining
profits.
   Bank of New York said yesterday that it closed its BNY
Securities Inc. unit, and laid off nearly half of the unit's
40 employees. Including Bank of New York, four securities
firms have given up or lost their primary-dealer status so
far this year, reducing the number of dealers to 41.

   Primary dealers are an elite group of big commercial banks
and brokerage firms that do business directly with the New
York Federal Reserve Bank in buying and selling U.S.
government securities that are used to influence national
monetary policy. Once one of the most coveted franchises in
international finance, the business of primary dealers has
become brutally competitive in recent years. As the number of
dealers has swelled, profit margins have been trimmed to the
bare bones. The Federal Reserve estimates that half of the
primary dealers were unprofitable or barely broke even last
year.
   Some of the resignations of primary dealers have been
attributed to the inability of the firms to earn enough from
the Treasury market to justify the capitalization of at least
$50 million required by the Fed.
   Officials at Bank of New York said their operation made
money. "It was a profitable business for us, but not
profitable enough," said a company spokesman. "The market
conditions are such that we are not getting the returns from
the business that we require."
   The resignation of Bank of New York comes less than two
years after it became a primary dealer through the
acquisition of Irving Bank. People in the bond market said
that Irving had tried to sell the dealership operations of
Irving Securities Inc. prior to the merger with Bank of New
York, but couldn't find a buyer.
   Several other primary dealerships are rumored to be on the
block or face closing, several traders said.
   Despite the closing of its primary dealer operation, Bank
of New York said it will continue trading U.S. government
bonds for its own account, as well as other securities.
