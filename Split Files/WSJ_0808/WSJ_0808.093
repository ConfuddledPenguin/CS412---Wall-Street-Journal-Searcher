   NEW YORK -- Corporate giving to education and charitable
causes rose a meager 3% in 1989, and is likely to grow only
5% this year, according to a survey by the Council for Aid to
Education.
   After more than a decade of annual increases averaging
15%, corporate contributions began to drop off in 1988, the
council said. A spokeswoman attributed the slowing rate to
changing tax laws, mixed corporate profits and uncertainty
over the economy.

   Increases in donations to education also have slowed in
recent years, the survey found. Contributions to education
rose 4% in 1989 and 6% in 1988, after 12 years of
double-digit jumps.
   In addition to curbing their largess, the study found
companies are redirecting their gifts. The share of dollars
devoted specifically to pre-college education jumped 10.5% in
1989, after years of much smaller increases.
   Total corporate giving to all causes in 1989 rose to an
estimated $6.5 billion, or about 2.1% of pretax corporate
profits. Giving to education rose to $2.8 billion, or 0.9% of
corporate profits, the council estimated. The growth in
corporate giving in 1988 was only 2%, the council now
estimates, down from an earlier estimate of 3.2%.
   Data for the survey were provided by 333 companies, which
account for 25% of corporate giving.
