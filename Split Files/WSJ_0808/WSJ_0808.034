   FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Babcock AG of West Germany, a
machinery and engineering concern, said it and Fiat S.p.A. of
Italy, an auto maker, agreed to form a joint-venture company
that will specialize in pollution-control engineering in
Italy.

25% of the venture, and Fiat's Fiatimpresit Sistemi
Ambientali environmental engineering unit 75%.

   The venture will be based in Milan and specialize in
engineering services for gas emission, as well as
waste-control systems for factories. Babcock primarily will
supply know-how and an unspecified amount of cash to the
venture, which will be managed by the Fiat unit.
