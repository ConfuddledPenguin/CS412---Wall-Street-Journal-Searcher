   NEW DELHI, India -- The political turbulence hobbling
Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh's government raises
troubling questions about India's economy.
   Growth is now brisk. Many economists predict that the
economy of the world's second most populous country will
expand 4.5% to 5% in the year ending March 31, 1991.

   But the economy faces acute problems: a worrying budget
deficit, accelerating inflation and a big current-account
deficit. Added to these are the age-old problems of poverty
and unemployment, which haven't lessened with a decade of
higher economic growth. Rising oil prices won't help.
   The Singh government was hoping to tackle its internal
economic problems by opening the economy further under a
policy of deregulating domestic industry, increasing exports
and, to a lesser extent, encouraging foreign investment. But
progress has been halted by a series of crises that threaten
to tear apart the eight-month-old government.
   "This government is weak," says a New Delhi economist. "It
can fiddle around the edges, but it won't do anything
fundamental economically. Politically, it can't." If left
unrelieved, the strain on the economy could lead to a
"difficult period" for India in the early 1990s, according to
a World Bank report in June. And if the current government
falls, it is likely to be followed by similarly fractious
coalition governments, resulting in inconsistent economic
policies.
   "The country has entered a long-term period of
instability," says Bhabani Sen Gupta, an analyst with the
Center for Policy Research, a local think tank.
   There is one positive development: Some analysts think Mr.
Singh's efforts to deregulate and open the economy, however
stillborn, prove that the idea of liberalization has finally
taken root in India after four decades of a planned economy
and state-sponsored socialism. "There's near unanimity that
this is the way to go," says S.L. Rao, director general of
the National Council of Applied Economic Research.
   But the question is whether politics will continue to
obstruct true liberalization. The government's political
problems seem intractable. Mr. Singh's is a minority
government, supported in Parliament by two parties outside
the ruling coalition. Mr. Singh's Janata Dal isn't so much a
political party as a hodge-podge of ambitious politicians,
many of whom have their eyes on the prime minister's job.
   Since May, discord has been evident among a group of
senior ministers, centered on Devi Lal, Mr. Singh's
76-year-old deputy prime minister and agriculture minister.
In a recent published interview, Mr. Lal described Mr. Singh
as "simpleminded" and "a weakling." Last Wednesday, Mr. Singh
fired Mr. Lal.
   Such infighting has paralyzed the government. On the
economic front, the intraparty disputes have wrecked several
government initiatives, in particular the industrial policy
announced in late May. The policy ended licensing
requirements for domestic industrial investments of less than
$14 million, with a higher threshold of $43 million for
backward regions. The program also promised automatic
clearance for imports of capital goods and raw materials, up
to certain limits.
   And the policy promised automatic approval for investments
in which a foreign partner held 40% equity or less, which
would have ended the lengthy, case-by-case approvals required
in the past. Even more important was the government's
decision to end the requirement that foreign investors export
as recompense for the money they made on the local market.
   At the same time, the policy reaffirmed the 40% equity
limit for foreigners, which turns many investors away. Total
foreign investment approved in 1989 was a scant $195 million.
   Foreign embassies and pro-liberalization analysts weren't
impressed with the policy but said it at least showed that
the government favored a more-open economy. But in March, the
Singh government rejected an investment application from
Coca-Cola Co. and "re-examined" an investment by PepsiCo Inc.
Mr. Singh said India would accept only the kinds of foreign
investments it desired.
   Within Mr. Singh's fractious cabinet, the new industrial
policy set off political fires. Mr. Lal and others criticized
it, saying the policy favored industry over farmers. Others
said it went against the country's commitment to socialism.
   Owing to these political pressures, much of the industrial
policy has been put on hold. Automatic approval of foreign
investments has been retracted: The government says it will
compose a list of industries in which automatic approval will
be given. Economic analysts wonder if other parts will be
implemented, as well as more recent deregulatory measures,
such as new incentives for private business to put up steel
plants.
   Economists argue whether Mr. Singh is a committed
"liberalizer," or simply a politician using liberalization to
solve shortterm problems. But one point is clear: The
liberalizers dominate economic discussion in India.
Dissenters in the government can hinder new programs, but
they have few fresh ideas of their own.
