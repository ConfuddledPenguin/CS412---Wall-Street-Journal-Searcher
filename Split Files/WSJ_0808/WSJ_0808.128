   WASHINGTON -- Pharmaceutical companies are working
furiously to head off a revolt against drug prices
spearheaded by their biggest customer: the U.S. government.
   In negotiations with Congress over how to reduce the
budget deficit, the White House Office of Management and
Budget has proposed limiting the availability of brand-name
prescription drugs under Medicaid, the state-federal program
that provides medical care to welfare recipients. The OMB
plan is a variation on a bill introduced in May by Democratic
Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas.

   For the moment, the high-level budget talks are stalled.
But simply by considering the possibility that Medicaid
reimbursements would be disallowed for expensive brand-name
drugs, should cheaper alternatives be available, the budget
summiteers have induced four major drug companies to hastily
propose cost-saving measures of their own. They are Merck &amp;
Co., Pfizer Inc., Upjohn Co. and the U.S. unit of Britain's
Glaxo Inc.
   Meanwhile, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
last month persuaded Jesse Jackson and other leaders in the
black and Hispanic communities to sign a letter to
budget-summit participants, denouncing the OMB plan as a
scheme to saddle welfare recipients with "second-class
medicine." To enlist the support of minority and health
groups, the trade group also has hired former Urban League
President Vernon Jordan, who is a partner in the Washington
law office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld.
   Medicaid is the largest purchaser of drugs in the U.S.,
accounting for about $3.5 billion, or more than 10%, of the
annual domestic market. But unlike other large drug
purchasers such as the Veterans Administration and a number
of major health maintenance organizations, the Medicaid
program doesn't receive discounts from pharmaceutical
companies.
   Under both the OMB proposal and Sen. Pryor's plan,
pharmacists would steer Medicaid patients away from expensive
medications prescribed by their doctors. Instead, the
pharmacists would be required to seek the doctors' approval
to prescribe a less costly alternative -- either a generic
version of the same drug or a different drug that is deemed
equally effective. Currently, the federal government doesn't
place limits on what drugs Medicaid will pay for, although
some states have done so.
   Advocates of cost-cutting note that prescription-drug
prices increased by more than three times the inflation rate
during the 1980s. Sen. Pryor says that hospitals and doctors
have already been subject to federal cost-containment
measures. But "we've done nothing with the pharmaceutical
industry," he says. "We've given them a free rein and a blank
check."
   Under Sen. Pryor's bill, drug companies would be required
to submit price bids to the states for inclusion in Medicaid
formularies, or lists of approved drugs. Bids that were
judged too high would be rejected. According to a preliminary
cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, federal
savings would be $43 million in 1991 and more than $300
million in subsequent years.
   The proponents of government measures to make
prescription-drug substitutions argue that this is already a
common cost-cutting procedure at hospitals. But the industry
argues that a Medicaid patient could suffer an adverse
reaction if given a drug that is chemically different from
that prescribed by the doctor. Such low-income patients "are
not seeing the doctor every day {and} don't have a nurse down
the hall," says Robert Allnutt, executive vice president of
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
   He maintains that the Pryor and OMB plans wrongly assume
that "products are interchangeable -- to quote George
Wallace, `it don't make a dime's worth of difference.' "
   Shortly before Sen. Pryor formally introduced his proposal
this past spring, Merck unveiled its own cost-saving measure
for Medicaid at the state level. (The company presented a
more-ambitious federal plan last month in the wake of the
budget-office proposal). John Zabriskie, president of Merck's
domestic marketing unit, says the drug company shares the OMB
and Sen. Pryor's concern about Medicaid's rising drug costs.
"Our fundamental difference," he says, "is that we believe
that poor people ought to have the same access to all our
medicines" as the general public.
   Under Merck's proposal, in any state that agreed not to
restrict Medicaid patients' access to individual Merck
products, Merck would phase in volume Medicaid discounts
ranging from 15% in the first year to 25% in the fifth year.
After that, Merck will match for Medicaid its best volume
discount for other large buyers such as the Veterans
Administration. Merck has already struck agreements along
these lines with 20 states, including California, Texas and
New Jersey.
   Since the budget summit took up the idea earlier this
month, similar proposals for Medicaid discounts or rebates
have been circulated by Glaxo, Pfizer and Upjohn (though an
Upjohn spokesman says that his company's proposal, which was
submitted for discussion to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, doesn't constitute an official company
endorsement of the idea).
   Sen. Pryor calls these suggestions "a step in the right
direction." But neither he nor the OMB shows any sign of
giving up.

   MERCK &amp; Co. has proposed a plan for drugs sold to Medicaid
with price discounts of 10% to 15% in the first two years and
10% to 25% in the fifth year, and the discounts would be
granted by all drug companies, not just Merck. The details of
the Merck plan were misstated in yesterday's edition.
