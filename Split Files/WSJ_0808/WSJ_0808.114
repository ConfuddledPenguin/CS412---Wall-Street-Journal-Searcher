   Track Records That Signal Peace or Peril

   Mutual fund investors who are worried about what will
happen to their stock funds if the recent market drop
continues and the economy slides into recession might step
back and take a look at the record.
   While past performance is no guarantee of future results,
looking at how well funds held up in past market declines may
provide valuable clues about what to expect.

<TEXT>
   Many small investors have been busily shifting their money
out of stock funds in recent days, as news of the Middle East
conflict added new fuel to fears of recession and inflation.
Some major mutual fund groups said redemptions slowed
somewhat yesterday, though official tallies won't be
available for a couple of days.
   Typically, some types of stock funds hold up better than
others when the market falls. Equity-income and balanced
funds, for example, tend to drop less than the market as a
whole, because they contain bonds and high-dividend stocks;
growth and growth-and-income funds tend to perform in line
with the market.
   But just looking at categories won't tell investors what
may happen to their funds, because there are many exceptions.
Getting an idea about how a specific fund is likely to
perform requires looking at its own performance history.
   For example, take Acorn Fund, a small-company growth fund
with assets of nearly $1 bil-lion. Because small-company
growth funds are among the most volatile stock mutual funds,
it would be easy to assume that Acorn can get squashed when
the market falls. But a look at figures compiled by Lipper
Analytical Services Inc. shows this isn't the case.
   Acorn not only has outpaced other small-company growth
funds over the past decade, but it did better than the market
in three out of four downturns. In the week ended last
Thursday, the latest week for which statistics are available,
Acorn declined 2.9%. This compares with a loss of 3.4% for
small-company growth stock funds as a group.
   Investors who want to determine down-market performance of
their funds won't find it easy. Mutual funds generally quote
performance figures on an annual basis, while market drops
occur at untidy intervals. Investors will have to ask the
fund representative what happened during specific down
cycles.
   Taking the trouble to ask can be well worthwhile to
investors, however, in helping them judge the desirabil-ity
of various funds. While different fund groups and different
individual funds may have similar long-term returns, they can
achieve those results with vastly different gyrations. This
can be important to investors who are easily scared when the
going gets tough.
   For example, equity-income, growth-and-income and growth
mutual fund groups all have 10-year annualized results of
15.3%. But over the decade, growth and growth-and-income
funds fluctuated widely, while equity-income funds gave
investors a smoother ride, tending to fall only about half as
much as the market in downturns and to rise less in market
climbs.
   The same holds for individual funds. For example, consider
Vanguard Group's Windsor Fund, a widely held no-load fund
that now is closed to new investors, and Washington Mutual
Investors, a broker-sold fund managed by Capital Research &amp;
Management Cos. Both are growth-and-income funds that gave
investors an average annual return of 19.1% in the 10 years
through June 30, according to Lipper.
   But while Windsor had a loss of 3.8% in the week ended
last Thursday, Washington Mutual was off only 1.1%. Looking
back at previous market downturns shows that Washington
Mutual had smaller losses than Windsor in three of the four
deepest declines in the 1980s.
