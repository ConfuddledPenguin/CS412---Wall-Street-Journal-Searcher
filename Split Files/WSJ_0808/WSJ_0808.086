   AMERISCRIBE Corp. (New York) -- The company completed an
agreement to refinance two defaulted debt issues. A
subsidiary of Household International Inc., Prospect Heights,
Ill., provided Ameriscribe with $25 million of term loans and
a $15 million revolving credit. Ameriscribe, formerly Service
Resources Corp., used about $24.8 million of the funds to pay
principal and accrued interest on its 9% and 11.5%
debentures. The debt had been issued by its ECL Industries
Inc. subsidiary and had been in default since November 1988.
Ameriscribe, which provides mailroom, messenger and copying
services to law firms and other businesses, will use the rest
for working capital and other purposes.
