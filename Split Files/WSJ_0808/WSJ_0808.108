   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said its small
affiliate bank in western Massachusetts will be merged into
the bank's main Boston-based affiliate to form one large bank
for the state.
   The merger is the latest step in a series of
consolidations the troubled bank has undertaken this year in
order to trim staff, streamline management and reorganize
assets. In February, it consolidated three eastern
Massachusetts affiliates into the bank's large Boston
affiliate, called Bank of New England N.A., which currently
has $13 billion in assets.

   Bank of New England-West, based in Springfield, Mass., has
$1 billion in assets, 700 full-time employees and 40 branches
offices. The merger will be effective pending approval by the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Bank of New
England-West's longtime president, C.D. "Buzz" Harrington,
had previously announced he will be retiring this summer.
   Bank officials said the western bank will eventually be
run by a regional president, who will report to Bruce
Wheeler, president of Bank of New England N.A.
   Since its $1.1 billion loss last year, largely due to bad
real estate loans made during its rapid expansion in the
1980s, the regional bank has trimmed 4,000 employees through
asset sales, layoffs and consolidations.
   "Certainly, we will examine the management situation out
there to see if there is any duplication," said bank
spokesman James Dorsey, who added that the layoffs from the
merger "should be modest."
