   BAHRAIN -- Elizabeth al-Kandry's eyes are wide with the
fear and fatigue of her flight through Iraqi tanks and land
mines.
   "I thought I was going to die," says the 22-year-old,
cradling her month-old baby in her lap. Just hours earlier,
she arrived in Bahrain with her husband, Mohammed, after
driving through the Saudi Arabian desert in a convoy of cars
escaping the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.

   Hundreds of Kuwaitis have abandoned their homes and are
risking such journeys as the situation in Kuwait has
deteriorated. "It was like hell," says Mrs. al-Kandry, a
Briton married to a Kuwaiti. "The Iraqis are taking the food.
People are fighting each other for food."
   At the causeway linking Saudi Arabia with the island state
of Bahrain, several hundred miles south of Kuwait, in the
Persian Gulf, dusty cars crammed with Kuwaitis line up at the
border crossing. Bahraini officials give their papers a
cursory glance before waving them through to safety.
Bahrainis are offering free housing to some refugees, and the
Kuwaiti Embassy foots the hotel bill for others.
   Those who have fled tell of near anarchy in their once
peaceful and prosperous city-state.
   "The first army came to fight, the second army has come to
loot," says Nagiba Diabali, a heavy-set 45-year-old swathed
in a traditional black cloak, called an "abaya."
   The Iraqi soldiers who poured across the border into
Kuwait in Thursday's blitzkrieg invasion were seasoned,
disciplined fighters from Iraq's elite presidential guard,
according to reports. But for the past few days, Kuwaitis
assert, Saddam Hussein has been sending poor peasants from
southern Iraq who have been enlisted in a so-called Popular
Army with promises of lavish spoils.
   "They are breaking into houses and stealing whatever they
can carry out," says Mrs. Diabali, as her sister-in-law sobs
beside her. The two women are exhausted from a grueling
drive, squeezed nine to a car, across the searing desert
frontier.
   "It wasn't the lack of food or the soldiers everywhere,"
says an engineer who is too frightened to give her name. She
voices fear that her daughters would be raped by the
soldiers, although reports of rape couldn't be verified. A
mob of soldiers, the engineer says, burst into her neighbor's
house, demanding gold and money. The family said its
valuables were all in safe deposit boxes at the bank.
   "The soldiers said, `If you haven't got gold, give us your
women,'" she says. "When I heard this, I ran from the house
in my bedroom slippers." She lifts her "abaya" to reveal a
pair of battered scuffs.
   "Please don't write that Moslems are doing this to
Moslems," she adds. "Saddam isn't a {true} Moslem. If the
Israelis invaded they would treat us better than this."
   Most of the fleeing Kuwaitis are coming without
possessions and with only as much cash as they had in their
homes when the invasion surprised them. Soon, even that might
be worthless. At a Caltex gas station near the causeway, a
sign scribbled hastily on Tuesday reads: "Saudi and Kuwaiti
currency not accepted." Exchange dealers reported running out
of dollars as Bahrainis rushed to dump Gulf currencies.
   Many Kuwaitis chose the shabbiest of their vehicles in
which to attempt their escape, saying that Iraqis had been
confiscating Mercedes-Benzes and other fancy cars. Some said
showrooms had been looted and the new cars driven off to
Iraq. Falah al-Dosari, an administrative manager at an
agricultural firm who fled Kuwait at sunset on Monday, said
he saw Iraqis shooting at cars and stealing them.
   The Kuwaitis say that many of the poor Iraqis, who live in
mud brick villages, have been dazzled by Kuwaiti wealth. "We
have a nice house -- like an American house -- with a pool,"
a businessman says. "When the Iraqi soldiers arrived they
asked if it was a club." He says the troops had no food or
water, so he gave them bread and cheese and asked them as one
Arab to another why they were behaving in such a way to a
neighbor. "They said they'd come to help us overthrow our
corrupt emir," the businessman says. "I told them we loved
our emir, and they looked astonished."
   Kuwaitis who have made it to Bahrain tell of driving
through the desert thick with Iraqi troops, tent encampments,
tanks and anti-aircraft batteries. The Kuwaitis say that far
from withdrawing, as Mr. Hussein claimed, troops appear to be
massing. The land between Kuwait City and the Saudi border
already has been heavily mined, they say.
   Elizabeth al-Kandry, who still carries a British passport,
was afraid troops would single her out and send her to
Baghdad along with the other foreign nationals they have
seized. When passing near troops, she pulled her Islamic
scarf tight over her fair hair and hunkered down alongside
her mother-in-law and sister-in-law.
   Mohammed, her husband, plans to head straight back to
Kuwait now that he has brought his family to safety. The
30-year-old petroleum analyst says he took part in a
demonstration of about 60 or 70 people on Sunday in downtown
Kuwait. "They {the Iraqis} opened fire on us and wounded five
people," he says. He intends to join other resisters and
sneak back across the border.
   For those trying to escape, Kuwaitis say, there seemed to
be no consistent policy on the part of the Iraqis. Some
refugees were turned back and others were allowed to leave.
   As well as taking cars and valuables, Kuwaitis say, some
soldiers literally demanded the clothes off their backs. The
Kuwaitis believe that Iraqis were ordered to swap their khaki
uniforms for the traditional white robes of Kuwaiti males to
lend credence to Saddam Hussein's assertion that Kuwaitis
have joined his forces.
   But, the Kuwaitis say, the pretense is laughable. "People
who are supposed to be Saddam's Kuwaiti supporters are
appearing on television," says Khalid Yousef, a merchant.
"But they don't know how to wear our traditional headdress"
-- a white cloth held in place by black cord. "They put it on
all crooked, and when they speak their accents are pure
Iraqi."
   But nobody has been laughing about other television
broadcasts, which reveal what Kuwaitis bitterly see as a
betrayal by Arab leaders such as Jordan's King Hussein, the
Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat and the
leaders of Yemen and Sudan. Many Kuwaitis have satellite
dishes tuned to CNN, which has broadcast reports of those
Arab leaders refusing to condemn the invasion and even
supporting Iraq.
   Some Kuwaitis here have come not from Kuwait but from
other Arab countries. Mohammed Umran was in Jordan managing a
touring Kuwaiti basketball team when the Iraqis invaded.
After seeing the mood in Jordan turn against Kuwait and
become almost hysterically pro-Saddam, he says, he packed up
the players, aged 16 to 18, and flew them to Bahrain.
   "Go to Jordan, to Yemen or the West Bank and see the
hospitals there, the schools. Kuwait built them," says
Khadija Mohammed, a 25-year-old science teacher. Adds another
Kuwaiti: "I really hope Kuwait comes back strong again,
because next time we'll know better who our real friends
are."
   Mrs. Mohammed was vacationing in London when the invasion
began. She has come to Bahrain in the hope of returning to
Kuwait to be with her parents, from whom she has heard
nothing since the day of the invasion. For now, she sits in
the lobby of the Holiday Inn, questioning each new arrival
for word of her family.
   "They might have died from a bomb," she says, "but we are
dying every day not knowing what is happening to them."
