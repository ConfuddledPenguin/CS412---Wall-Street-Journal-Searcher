   Saudi Arabia agreed to increase the kingdom's oil output
to help make up for the loss of supplies from Iraq and
Kuwait, senior Bush administration officials said last night.
   In a similar reversal of policy, the president of
Venezuela, after meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle,
agreed to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day to
help make up the four million-barrel shortfall caused by the
interruption of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports.

   Petroleum prices, meanwhile, rose sharply again late
yesterday on worries that world supplies may be crimped soon
by new developments in the Mideast crisis.
   Spot prices of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark
crude, jumped as much as $1.50 a barrel in late trading
following news of a multinational military force, including
U.S. troops, being sent to Saudi Arabia to protect it from
Iraq. Prior to the news, which came as most oil markets were
closing, the rate of price increases had slowed sharply, with
some crudes rising only pennies a barrel after recent $2 to
$4 daily jumps.
   There was new evidence, meanwhile, that global sanctions
against Iraq for invading and occupying Kuwait are beginning
to cut deeply into its oil exports. Turkey barred tankers
from loading from a second Iraqi pipeline to the
Mediterranean. Earlier, Iraq had closed the other line
through Turkey because of a lack of customers.
   Also, according to oil industry experts, Iraq's use of
another pipeline, which crosses Saudi Arabia, had been
sharply reduced. Apparently, the storage is full at the Red
Sea export terminal used by Iraq as tankers, operating under
the sanctions, sail away empty.
   Until last month, when the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries moved to tighten supplies to boost
then-depressed oil prices, there was much talk of a world oil
glut. Although fuel inventories were considered to be about
at normal levels, those for crude oil were generally thought
to be much too high.
   Only a week ago Energy Security Analysis Inc., which
tracks oil supplies world-wide, had estimated that there
still was a surplus of 100 million barrels in global
inventories of crude oil. But that was before Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait last Thursday.
   Prior to the disclosures about Saudi Arabia and Venezuela,
John Redpath, a market analyst for the Washington-based firm,
said, "With four million barrels a day out of the market, it
will take only a month to work that off."
   Contributing to the evidence that the crude oil glut may
already be drying up was the latest weekly report on U.S.
petroleum statistics by the American Petroleum Institute.
Released as usual after futures markets had closed yesterday,
the latest API report showed that U.S. crude inventories,
although still higher than normal at 379.7 million barrels,
were drawn down last week by some seven million barrels.
   The potential shrinking of petroleum inventories comes on
top of what John Sauer, chief energy economist of Conoco
Inc., labels the "fairly limited production capability" that
could be called upon to replace Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes in
world oil markets. "If we take a look at the requirements,"
Mr. Sauer told a small group of reporters yesterday, "we
think the world would like to buy about 23.5 million barrels
a day of OPEC oil."
   But if the Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports are eliminated
completely, Mr. Sauer said supplies could total three million
barrels a day less than desired.
   While several countries could produce more oil, much of
the additional capacity is in the Persian Gulf region and in
the range of Iraq's guns. Most experts consider that all four
million barrels a day of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports could be
supplanted with added output from other OPEC countries.
"There is spare capacity to produce that oil if there were
some form of international consensus to do so," Cambridge
Energy Research Associates officials reported.
   Saudi Arabia, which apparently hadn't yet pledged to a
specific figure for increased production, has been producing
5.4 million barrels a day and has a daily output capacity of
7.5 million barrels, according to studies by Petroleum
Finance Co. The Bush administration has been seeking a
commitment for increased output of about two million barrels
a day.
   Industry officials noted that the United Arab Emirates had
been producing as much as 2.2 million barrels a day before it
was brought back into the OPEC fold with a quota of 1.5
million last month. It could produce 600,000 to 700,000
barrels a day more. Libya could increase output by 300,000
barrels, although it supports Iraq, and Nigeria and others
could add as much.
   Although most OPEC oil ministers continued to maintain in
public that they are going to stick to the quotas agreed to
at their late July meeting, there were reports that the
United Arab Emirates also might be willing to boost output
with the protection of the new military forces.
   Still, many in the oil industry expect oil prices to
continue rising -- with some fallbacks -- until the Middle
East confrontation with Iraq is over, or until demand
declines. Some now project prices might go as high as $45 a
barrel. In U.S. futures trading yesterday, crude for
September delivery settled at $28.31 a barrel.
