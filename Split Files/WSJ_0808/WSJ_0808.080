   I was interested to read Jack Flam's review of "The
Passionate Eye: Impressionists and Other Master Paintings
From the Collection of Emil G. Buhrle," at the National
Gallery of Art in Washington (Leisure &amp; Arts, July 2). I
agree with Mr. Flam that it is in very bad taste to lionize a
man such as Emil Buhrle who was and is known in Europe as
"The Merchant of Death." Although many Swiss collaborated
with the Nazis throughout World War II, Buhrle is probably
the best known, if not for anything else but the sheer volume
of his arms business. One of the most sought after pieces of
armament made by Buhrle's Oerlikon Machine Works was the
anti-tank gun. This high-precision gun, the best of its time,
destroyed many Allied tanks and their crews.
   It would be interesting to know who made up this catalog.
Was it produced in Switzerland or in the U.S.?
