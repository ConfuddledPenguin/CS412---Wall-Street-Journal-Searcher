   It looks as if Herbert Grover, Wisconsin's School
Superintendent, can no longer stand in the schoolhouse door
and block 1,000 low-income children from attending the school
of their choice. On Monday, a Wisconsin judge ruled that
black Rep. Polly Williams's plan to allow students to use
vouchers to attend private schools is constitutional.
   Judge Susan Steingass ruled invalid Mr. Grover's
contention that the voucher plan didn't serve a valid public
purpose and was discriminatory in being limited to Milwaukee
inner-city schools. She wrote that if choice works, the
benefit would flow "not only to a few students in Milwaukee
but to our educational system as a whole, both by the lessons
learned and the education improved." The judge also ruled
that Mr. Grover exceeded his authority in demanding the
private schools fill out complex forms and meet other
bureaucratic "diktats" not specified in the legislation.

   The voucher plan has divided black parents from many
liberals who claim to represent them. When a white attorney
for the teachers' unions fighting the plan told Judge
Steingass the plan wouldn't help minorities, he earned a
swift rebuttal from Anne Sulton, the Madison, Wis., NAACP's
attorney. "I am offended at that suggestion," she told the
court. "I don't see any African-Americans here opposing this
plan. I do see a courtroom full of African-American parents
supporting increased educational opportunity for their
children."
