   HOLLYWOOD -- One of three rival groups planning movies
about Robin Hood tried to steal a march on competitors with a
change in strategy and an accelerated production timetable.
   Twentieth Century Fox said it abandoned plans for an
up-scale, movie-theater version of its "Adventures of Robin
Hood" in favor of television movie slated for domestic
broadcast next spring on the network operated by its sister
Fox Broadcasting Co. Both companies are units of Fox Inc., in
turn a unit of Australia-based News Corp. Fox will distribute
the movie in theaters abroad.

   The announcement is the latest effort in a contest that
has been the buzz of Hollywood for months.
   At rival Morgan Creek Productions Inc., cameras are
scheduled to roll Sept. 3 on "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"
-- a big-budget swashbuckler starring heartthrob Kevin
Costner and slated for release in theaters next spring. Time
Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit will distribute the movie in
the U.S. and Canada.
   With the Morgan Creek-Costner effort covering the
big-budget base and Fox's speedy TV version in the works,
industry speculation has focused on Sony Corp.'s Tri-Star
Pictures unit, the third studio interested in Robin Hood.
   Tri-Star declined to comment on its plans, but a
knowledgeable industry insider said, "I think Tri-Star's
Robin Hood has just taken an arrow to the brain."
