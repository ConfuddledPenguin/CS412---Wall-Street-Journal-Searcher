   WASHINGTON -- President Bush has decided against
intervening in the proposed acquisition of Norton Co. by
Compagnie de Saint-Gobain of France.
   Worcester, Mass.-based Norton makes abrasive products and
enginering materials and has engaged in extensive research
and development of advanced ceramics and diamond films deemed
to have national security significance.

   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States found
that the acquisition wouldn't impair national security.
   Last month, Saint-Gobain's subsidiary, SG Acquisition
Corp., extended its $90-a-share tender offer for all of
Norton's common shares outstanding to 5 p.m. EDT today.
