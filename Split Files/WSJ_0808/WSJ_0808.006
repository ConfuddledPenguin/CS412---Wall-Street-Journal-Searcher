   NEW YORK -- The stock market, which had been in retreat
since Iraq invaded Kuwait last week, put the brakes on its
slide by finishing mixed in heavy trading.
   But prices moved sharply in both directions as market
players reacted to the day's flow of news reports and
speculation about the situation in the Middle East. News
reports of the impending U.S. troop deployment in Saudi
Arabia caused wide price fluctuations in the closing minutes
of trading.

   "It doesn't take much to shake the market up in here,"
said Jeffrey Kaminsky, head of block trading at Mabon, Nugent
&amp; Co. He added that stocks appear headed for "treacherous
waters" until the situation is clarified.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which swung within a
range of about 65 points, fell 5.70 to 2710.64. The average
would have been little changed if not for declines in its
five oil-related stocks, which were among the energy issues
hit with profit-taking after surging in the wake of the Iraqi
invasion.
   Broader measures posted slight gains, as Standard &amp; Poor's
500-Stock Index rose 0.40 to 334.83, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index added 0.13 to 183.45 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.47 to 310.08.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 845 to 740 on
the Big Board, where trading was brisk for the fourth
straight session. Volume totaled 231,580,000 shares; on
Monday, 240,400,000 changed hands.
   Prices peaked just after the opening as market players
reacted favorably to reports that foreigners in Iraq and
Kuwait might be permitted to leave. The Dow industrials
climbed about 35 points within the first 15 minutes of
trading.
   The market gradually gave back its gains throughout the
morning and then fell to session lows at midafternoon amid a
round of selling sparked by rumors of a report that Iraqi
troops had moved into Saudi Arabia.
   After those rumors weren't confirmed by employees of
British Broadcasting Corp., said to be the source of the
report, stocks bounced back from their slide.
   Despite the market's gyrations, there was "consistent
selling throughout the day" and money flowed out of the
market after its early rise, said Edward P. Nicoski, managing
director of technical analysis at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood,
Minneapolis.
   "It just seems premature to signal a bottom here yet," Mr.
Nicoski said. The industrial average has lost a total of
188.62 points, or 6.5%, in the four sessions since Iraqi
troops entered Kuwait early Thursday, sending oil prices
soaring.
   Although crude-oil prices continued to climb, oil stocks
generally didn't. Among the five oil-related issues in the
30-stock average, Texaco fell 3/8 to 64 5/8, Exxon dropped
1/4 to 53 3/8, Chevron lost 3/4 to 78 5/8, USX slipped 5/8 to
33 7/8 and Du Pont fell 1/8 to 39 3/8.
   One pair of dividend-related trades by institutions
boosted volume in Texaco, the most active Big Board issue.
The trades, designed to capture the company's next quarterly
dividend, accounted for 10 million of the 11.4 million shares
to change hands in composite trading.
   Elsewhere in the energy sector, Mobil went down 1/2 to 67
1/2, Amoco dipped 1/4 to 57 5/8, Phillips Petroleum dropped
1/2 to 30 1/2, Baker Hughes slipped 1/4 to 32 7/8,
Schlumberger fell 5/8 to 66 3/8 and Dresser Industries went
down 5/8 to 52 3/8.
   Recession worries, fueled by higher oil prices, spurred
selling in such sectors as autos and retailing, which tend to
be sensitive to the economy's twists and turns.
   General Motors lost 1 3/8 to 40 1/8 on 2.6 million shares
and Ford Motor dropped 3/8 to 38. Among major retailers,
Sears Roebuck fell 1 to 30, Woolworth dropped 5/8 to 27 3/8
and Dayton Hudson fell 2 to 62 1/2.
   Investors gravitated to recession-resistant consumer
stocks. Philip Morris rose 1 1/4 to 45 1/4 on 2.9 million
shares, Coca-Cola added 7/8 to 42 3/8, Procter &amp; Gamble rose
1 5/8 to 77 1/4, Gillette gained 1 5/8 to 57 5/8, Pfizer
advanced 2 1/4 to 70 3/4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1 5/8
to 60 1/8.
   Alcan Aluminium, second to Texaco on the NYSE's most
actives list, finished unchanged at 22 1/2 on volume of four
million shares. Dividend-capture trades also boosted volume
in Alcan, which, like Texaco, carries a dividend yield of
about 5% and is due to make a payout shortly.
   Precious-metals stocks, which rose along with oils
following the Iraqi invasion, ended mixed as the price of
gold stabilized.
   Battle Mountain Gold added 1/4 to 12 3/8, Hecla Mining
ended unchanged at 12, Homestake Mining rose 1/4 to 21 and
Placer Dome gained 1/8 to 17 1/2.
   Chemical Banking set the pace for an upturn among
money-center bank issues by climbing 1 1/8 to 22 1/2. In
reiterating an "attractive" rating on the stock, PaineWebber
noted that a sustained rise in oil prices may bring further
improvement in the performance of Chemical's Texas Commerce
Bancshares subsidiary, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.
   Elsewhere in the sector, Citicorp gained 1/4 to 18 3/4 on
1.9 million shares, Chase Manhattan gained 1/2 to 17 7/8,
Manufacturers Hanover rose 1/8 to 28 3/8, Bankers Trust New
York added 1/2 to 35 1/2 and First Chicago rose 1 to 24 1/2.
   Eldon Industries gained 3/4 to 19 7/8 after Rubbermaid
agreed to acquire the company through an exchange of stock
with an estimated value of $186.5 million to $216.7 million.
Rubbermaid dropped 1 7/8 to 35.
   Northern States Power tumbled 2 5/8 to 31 3/4. Minnesota
regulators rejected the company's request for a $120.8
million rate increase.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.43
to 339.84. Volume totaled 19,410,000.
   Activity in put warrants on foreign stock indices, which
rise in value as those indices decline, dominated trading.
The warrants fell across the board, reflecting expectations
that overseas markets would rebound from their oil-related
setbacks.
