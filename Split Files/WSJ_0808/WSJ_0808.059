   NEW YORK -- Horn &amp; Hardart Co. said it will sell to Arby's
Inc. for $5 million 22 franchised Arby's restaurants in
southern Florida.
   Earlier this year, Horn &amp; Hardart announced plans to sell
all of its East Coast restaurant holdings, to focus on
Hanover Cos., a direct marketing subsidiary. The company's
remaining East Coast restaurant operations include 129
franchised and 22 company-owned Bojangles' Fried Chicken &amp;
Biscuits outlets and five Tony Roma's units.
