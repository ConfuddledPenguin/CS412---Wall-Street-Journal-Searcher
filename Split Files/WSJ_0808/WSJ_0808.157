   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices strongly extended
Monday's resurgence in early trading, rising to new
life-of-contract highs. But they couldn't sustain the
advances, and futures finished with only modest gains.
   The September contract ended only 0.95 cent a pound higher
at $1.2730 after trading as high as $1.3030.

   Analysts said that, with the slowing U.S. economy and the
consequent softer demand for copper, traders were focusing on
the continuing strong economies of Japan and West Germany.
   The Mideast crisis in recent days has stirred concern that
the boom in oil prices might hurt world-wide economies,
resulting in a general slowdown in copper consumption.
Presumably Japan, a major copper importer, would be among
those most affected.
   However, said William O'Neill, senior commodity strategist
for Merrill Lynch, New York, "The focus in the market is on
the short term, rather than on the long view with its
economic considerations."
   Japan hasn't eased up on its aggressive purchases of
copper in London, Mr. O'Neill said, and it has "been the
engine for the price firmness."
   Fred Demler, metal economist at PaineWebber, New York,
said: "Copper imports into Japan are up 35% this year vs. a
year ago and are expected to continue to rise. Brass mills
there are looking for a large increase in copper consumption
later this year."
   Mr. Demler said that although sharp increases in world oil
prices triggered worldwide recessions in 1974 and 1980, "I
think traders are focusing on what is happening now."
   The pending unification of West and East Germany has
stimulated housing construction and brass-mill consumption of
copper there, he said.
   World-wide, Mr. Demler said, both supply and demand are
subject to negative factors. On the one hand, global
inventories of refined copper currently are up 85,000 tons
since the end of the first quarter at 655,000 tons, or about
four weeks' consumption.
   On the other hand, he said, world mining production of
copper in the first five months of this year was 2% below
that of the year-earlier period. The drop in mine production
will probably lead to tightness in refined production in the
third quarter and possibly in the fourth, he said.
   John Rogers, vice president of Regan MacKenzie Inc., a
Seattle brokerage firm, said: "People are forgetting that the
U.S. is no longer the world's major copper consumer.
Therefore, a slowdown in the U.S. economy doesn't have a
significant impact on the overall world copper picture."
   As a result, he said, he sees no sign of a collapse in
copper prices. "Considering that production costs of copper
range between 85 cents and 90 cents a pound, $1 a pound for
copper can be justified in the foreseeable future," Mr.
Rogers said.
   "There are those who look at the long term and say that
copper prices can go back to 65 cents a pound," he said.
"That's not likely to happen, barring a major recession or a
depression."
   One dealer, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "Most
people are thoroughly confused as to where the copper market
is going. You can flip a coin at this point, and one side is
as good as the other."
   Over the long term, he said, if inflation strikes because
of the oil crisis, "the higher cost of doing business is bad
for the economy and bad for copper." But on the other hand,
he said, conflict can be good for copper, which is used in
making armaments.

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were lower. December
delivery gold recovered from early declines to end 10 cents
an ounce lower at $393.70. September silver was off 3.2 cents
an ounce at $4.8880. October platinum ended with a loss of
$8.30 an ounce at $482.10 but at one point traded as low as
$477.50. There was less of a crisis atmosphere early in the
day, and gold prices slumped, analysts said. However, Mideast
tensions mounted later, and gold recovered almost all its
losses. Cash market demand for gold bullion was "spotty," an
analyst said. The weakness in platinum was attributed to a
reduced likelihood of violence in South Africa after news
that the African National Congress had suspended its
guerrilla campaign, the analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of corn, wheat and soybean
futures settled mixed at the Chicago Board of Trade. Traders
are caught between two schools of thought. Some are
speculating that Soviet purchases of U.S. crops might
accelerate as the rise in oil prices helps the Soviet Union
generate more revenue from its oil fields. At the same time,
prices are being depressed by the approach of what will
probably be relatively large harvests of corn and soybeans.
Although an unusually wet spring and summer in the Midwest
slowed the maturity of the crops, they are generally in good
condition. Corn for September delivery ended at $2.54 a
bushel, down a quarter of a cent, while September soybeans
rose half a cent to $6.0025 a bushel.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose slightly. The October contract
ended with a gain of 0.08 cent a pound at 10.50 cents. Demand
developed after a report that China had bought 50,000 to
80,000 tons of raw sugar. "This indicates there is demand for
sugar at these low prices," an analyst said. Another
price-supporting development, the analyst said, was Brazil's
announcement late Monday that it would suspend imports of
Iraqi oil. This led to speculation that Brazil might use more
sugar to make ethanol, an alternative fuel, and consequently
would have less sugar to export, according to the analyst.
Another factor was Hurricane Diana, which was approaching the
Mexican coast near sugar-growing areas, the analyst said,
creating concern about possible crop damage.
