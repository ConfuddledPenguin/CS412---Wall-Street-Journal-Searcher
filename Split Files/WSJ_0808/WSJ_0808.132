   National Broadcasting Co. said it would implement a new
four-year contract Aug. 15 for a union representing
producers, news writers, engineers and technicians despite
the union's overwhelming rejection of the pact.
   The decision was made following a meeting yesterday
between NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., and the union,
the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians.

   A spokesman for NABET said the union, which has about
2,500 members, will meet tomorrow to discuss what action
could be taken. "We tried to encourage further negotiations,
but NBC said it would implement the final offer even though
we rejected it twice," the spokesman said.
   The previous contract expired March 31. No strike vote has
been taken, and the NABET spokesman said it was "highly
unlikely" that a strike would occur. The union went on a
17-week strike against New York-based NBC in 1987. The main
issue in this contract dispute involves jurisdiction over
people hired by the day rather than on a full-time basis.
