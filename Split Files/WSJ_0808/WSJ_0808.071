   NEW YORK -- In a move expected to salvage his magazine
company, Owen Lipstein said a Japanese media company has
purchased a 50% interest in his New American Magazine Co.
   Terms of the acquisition were not announced, but industry
executives close to Mr. Lipstein said Japanese Independent
Communication Co. spent less than $15 million for its half
interest in the publisher of Smart, Mother Earth News and
Psychology Today.

   The acquisition by Tokyo-based JICC is the first
investment of any size by a Japanese media company in a U.S.
magazine company. JICC publishes 10 consumer magazines in
Japan as well as non-fiction books. It also produces records,
compact disks and computer software; and it owns a travel
agency.
   Industry experts, however, said the acquisition will
probably not signal a wave of Japanese buying in U.S.
magazines. "This may stimulate more interest by the Japanese,
but they are still trying to figure out the American market,"
said John Suhler, president of Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates
Inc., the New York-based investment banker who linked Mr.
Lipstein with JICC.
   Mr. Lipstein said he will continue as chairman and
president of New American. He will also remain president of
Smart, a men's magazine he co-owns with its founding editor,
Terry McDonell.
   Seiichi Hasumi, chairman of JICC, said the company intends
to "establish and develop a leading-edge publishing and media
organization in the U.S." Mr. Lipstein said that JICC's
acquisition was a "homerun, by any standards." He said the
publishing partnership will represent a pattern other
Japanese companies may follow in entering publishing in the
U.S. "I have sold half the company, but I feel great freedom
and no sense of loss."
   For almost a year, Mr. Lipstein's magazines teetered near
disaster. Last year, he was forced to sell American Health
magazine to Reader's Digest Association Inc. for $29.1
million. The sale was necessary to pay off debt incurred by
Mr. Lipstein's purchases of Mother Earth News in 1985 and
Psychology Today in 1988.
   As he wrestled with debt payments, Mr. Lipstein was forced
to delay the mailing of certain issues of his magazines to
subscribers, a development which angered advertisers. And as
talks with the Japanese dragged on, Mr. Lipstein was forced
to dismiss 30 staffers in early June, while a number of top
executives and editors left the company.
   Publication of Psychology Today was suspended in December
1989. Mr. Lipstein said the magazine will reappear in "late
fall," with a redesign.
