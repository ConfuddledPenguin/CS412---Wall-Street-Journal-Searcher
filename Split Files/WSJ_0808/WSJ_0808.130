   Canadian Airlines International, a unit of PWA Corp., said
an agreement to sell two aircraft to American Airlines for
385 million Canadian dollars (US$334.9 million) was canceled
because of a U.S. regulatory action.
   PWA, based in Calgary, Alberta, previously had said it
expected a pretax gain of about C$100 million on the sale of
the two Boeing 747-400 aircraft. The company reported a
C$16.1 million loss in this year's first half.

   PWA ordered the two aircraft, still in production, for
delivery next February and May, then sold the delivery
positions to American on condition that American be awarded
the right to serve a route between Chicago and Tokyo. A U.S.
administrative law judge recommended last week that the route
go to United Airlines instead. American is a unit of AMR
Corp., Fort Worth, Texas. United is a unit of Chicago-based
UAL Corp.
   PWA said it plans to take delivery of the aircraft
scheduled for February and seek a buyer for the second plane.
