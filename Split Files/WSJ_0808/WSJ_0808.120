   A.L. Laboratories Inc., Fort Lee, N.J., said it acquired
NMC Laboratories Inc., a Glendale, N.Y., maker of
prescription creams and ointments for topical use.
   A.L. Labs, which has interests in pharmaceuticals and
animal-health products, didn't disclose terms. But it said
NMC Labs is expected to post 1990 sales of about $14 million
and will contribute immediately to earnings. The unit
complements A.L. Labs's Barre-National liquid pharmaceuticals
business.

   Separately, A.L. Labs reported that its second-quarter
earnings climbed 12% to $2.6 million, or 23 cents a share,
from $2.3 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue slipped 3.1% to $64.8 million from $66.9 million.
   A.L. Labs said its second period, normally a weaker
quarter, benefited from concentration on products carrying
fatter profit margins and careful control of manufacturing
costs.
