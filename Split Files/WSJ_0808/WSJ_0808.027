   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Pratt &amp; Lambert Inc. said its board
authorized the purchase of as many as 300,000, or 5%, of the
paint, chemical coatings and adhesives company's shares
outstanding, through open-market or private transactions.
   The company said an additional 125,000 shares may be
bought back under a September 1989 board resolution. Pratt &amp;
Lambert said it believes the buy-backs are an "advantageous
use of corporate funds" and won't interfere with business
plans.
