   The temperature's rising in Fidel Castro's Cuba. On
Friday, a young couple with an infant burst into the Spanish
Embassy compound. "They were yelling and screaming
hysterically, things like `We can't go on living in this
country,'" a Spanish diplomat said. Nine more Cubans entered
the Spanish Embassy on Sunday, bringing the total there to
18. Other Cubans are holed up in the Swiss, Czech and Italian
missions.
   The last time we saw this in Cuba it ended up in the mass
exodus known as "Mariel." On April 5, 1980, 12 Cubans
commandeered a city bus and crashed it into the Peruvian
Embassy in Havana, killing a guard. Once inside they demanded
asylum. By April 8, more than 10,000 Cubans had squeezed into
the Peruvian Embassy. Fidel opened the floodgates, also
sending thousands of jail and mental-institution inmates to
Miami with the genuine dissidents.

   This time Fidel is determined to stem the flow before it
gets out of hand. Cuba's deputy foreign minister announced
Tuesday that none of the 25 Cubans sheltering at the Havana
embassies would be allowed to leave Cuba. Fidel is already
hard pressed by dwindling assistance from East European
economies, and he may have become upset by a new round of
embassy refugees. Most recently in Albania, and before that
in Erich Honecker's East Germany.
