   TORONTO -- Canadian Auto Workers President Robert White
opened contract talks with the Canadian subsidiary of General
Motors Corp. by demanding higher wages and improved
protection against inflation.
   The union leader also demanded some guarantees against
possible job losses that result from corporate strategic
decisions. However, the CAW is more accepting of job losses
resulting from a downturn in market conditions, contrary to
the United Auto Workers, which is seeking total job security
during contract negotiations in the U.S.

   Frederick Curd, GM Canada's vice president and director of
personnel, said any wage increase must be tied to
improvements in productivity. He said the company was looking
for a "moderate settlement" that would help protect GM's
market share in Canada. In the first nine months of the 1990
model year, which began last October, GM had 33.9% of the
Canadian car market, down from 34.9% in all of 1989.
   Both sides said they hadn't defined how big a wage
increase they would consider. Both the Canadian and U.S.
union contracts with the Big Three automakers, including GM,
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., expire Sept. 14.
   Mr. Curd said GM Canada also wants more flexible work
rules at its plants and improved attendance levels. He said
absenteeism, including sick leave and scheduled vacations,
currently runs at an average 18.2% of GM's Canadian work
force, compared with about 15% at the company's U.S. plants.
   Unlike the UAW, the CAW leader doesn't believe that total
job security can be guaranteed. However, Mr. White said he
wants some protection for workers who lose their jobs as a
result of what is known in the industry as "out-sourcing,"
which involves a company's obtaining a product from an
outside supplier.
   Mr. White said the union wants workers affected by
outsourcing to be offered early retirements, voluntary
severance payments or positions at other plants.
