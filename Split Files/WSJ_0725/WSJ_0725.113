   Paul Micou is American, but the antecedents of his very
entertaining first novel, "The Music Programme" (Birch Lane,
240 pages, $16.95), are exclusively English. If his
understated satiric manner recalls the Evelyn Waugh of
"Decline and Fall" and "Black Mischief," and if his dramatis
personae remind one of the academics in David Lodge's novels,
his tale of privileged white folks stationed in a Third World
backwater -- where they drink too much, work too little and
live and love with exceptional superficiality -- brings to
mind Noel Coward's witty (though little read) novel "Pomp and
Circumstance."
   The "programme" of Mr. Micou's title is an international
organization headquartered at a wilderness compound in the
sweltering, strife-ridden African nation of Timbali. Its
putative mission is to unite the world through music, but its
real purpose is to perpetuate its own existence -- and, of
course, the high-paying jobs of its mostly indolent
employees. Among these are Dan O'Connor, a randy young
speechwriter, and Dr. Humphrey Lord, a Bach devotee who's at
work on a book proving that his hero was an atheist. ("He
found the going really rather tough," Mr. Micou writes, "but
he was dogged.")

   Then there's Ludvik Kastostis, the egomaniacal Czech
composer-in-residence who dismisses Mozart and Beethoven as
"nincompoops" and writes "music with an agenda" -- loud,
painfully dissonant avant-garde symphonies that call for
amateur pianists and animal noises.
   Kastostis and his colleagues lead a cushy life until a
determined young U.S. congressional aide, Charles "Crack"
McCray, comes to Timbali seeking evidence that the program's
American subsidy is being wasted. The evidence presents
itself immediately -- at Timbali's airport bar, in fact,
where a bibulous program employee, unaware of McCray's
mission, brags that he never goes into the office yet gets
promoted frequently anyhow.
   Mr. Micou, who has worked in Africa for a U.N. agency,
writes with an unfailing comic sense about the hypocrisies of
cultural bureaucracy and about the inconveniences and
corruptions of Third World life. He has a smart, brisk style
and does a first-rate job of introducing the characters and
milieu, so one is a bit disappointed by the way the plot
works itself out: One expects it to be cleverer, more neatly
orchestrated. Yet the book often is hilarious, and never less
than engaging.

   The same can't be said for Bob Katz's debut novel, "Hot
Air" (Birch Lane, 220 pages, $17.95). Danny Frank, the
"mildly progressive" proprietor of an ailing Washington,
D.C., speakers' bureau, tries to resuscitate the firm by
acquiring as a client a popular Latin American revolutionary
leader named Zapatu and taking him on a lecture tour of
American colleges.
   It's a promising satiric premise. But Mr. Katz makes only
mild, halfhearted stabs at satirizing Danny's
"progressivism," Zapatu's Marxism and the American academy's
fondness for south-of-the-border radicals. The fact is, Mr.
Katz finds all these things admirable; when Danny holds up
Zapatu as a moral exemplar and rants about "the religion of
capitalism" Mr. Katz apparently agrees with him.
   Where, then, is the humor in "Hot Air"? Well, Mr. Katz
tries to amuse us by disguising dreary leftist cliches about
the U.S. and capitalism as jokes. He doesn't do this very
successfully, since he's the sort who thinks the mere mention
of Gerald Ford's name is good for a laugh. Yet there are some
chuckles here, as when a Zapatu follower offers a bad-movie
eulogy of his leader: "When it is time for action, Zapatu is
the lion. When it is time for planning, Zapatu is the owl."

   Lewis Shiner's third novel, "Slam" (Doubleday, 233 pages,
$18.95), may be the first book to employ skateboarding as its
dominant symbol. Set in Texas, it's the story of Dave, who
has "never lived anywhere where people's cars started on the
first try." He's bitter about the six-month jail term he's
just served for tax evasion, but things seem to be looking
up: He's landed a job as caretaker of a recently deceased old
woman's manse and of the 23 cats to which she left her
fortune.
   Yet his orderly new life is soon disrupted by a host of
wackos, among them a sex-happy fundamentalist, an unruly
former cellmate and a local "UFO pastor." Dave soon realizes
that the house is just another prison and that the closest
he's come to real freedom is seeing a young skateboarder
momentarily suspended in midair. (The word "slam" is both a
synonym for jail and the term for what happens when
skateboarders wipe out.)
   Mr. Shiner means to do more than tell a story. Among much
else, he wants to illuminate the nature of individual
responsibility and the relation between the laws (civil,
social and natural) that we live by and the soul's need for
transcendence.
   "Slam," alas, is too slight a vehicle for so heavy a
thematic cargo. Yet Mr. Shiner's prose is very fine -- fast,
sharp, vivid, unsentimental -- and "Slam" has its funny and
touching moments.
