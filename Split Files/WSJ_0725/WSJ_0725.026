   Reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold,
special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and
the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign
currencies -- at the IMF.
   The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased $491
million in June to $47.29 billion, while gold reserves were
unchanged at $11.07 billion. Holdings of IMF special drawing
rights in the month rose $94 million to $10.49 billion, and
the U.S. reserve position at the IMF dropped $315 million to
$8.45 billion.
