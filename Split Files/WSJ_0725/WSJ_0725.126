   PARIS -- A few months ago, the strategic thinkers at
Credit Commercial de France had a bright idea.
   Why not swap one of their small, unneeded banking
subsidiaries for a West German bank's small subsidiary? Each
bank could gain a foothold in the other's country, in
preparation for the post-1992 lowering of European Community
internal trade barriers.

   CCF sent out feelers, but the answer came back loud and
clear: No West German banks were for sale, and certainly not
to foreigners.
   Over the years, many others have found West German
acquisitions difficult, if not impossible. Air Liquide S.A.,
for example, has acquired 25 U.S. companies in the past 20
years -- but just one across the Rhine River in West Germany.
   Lafarge Coppee S.A. and Societe des Ciments Francais, two
of the world's largest cement groups, also have grown through
steady acquisition abroad. Lafarge Coppee managed to acquire
a small West German cement plant in the 1970s, and it has
lately bought into some East German companies. But both
companies' interest in acquiring West German cement companies
in recent years has been rebuffed.
   France, West Germany's largest neighbor, may be the most
frustrated, but it isn't alone. British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher has warned that the difficulty of arranging
West German takeovers could hamper the creation of a truly
common European market.
   All countries set up some barriers against foreigners.
France is notorious for it, and even the U.S. Congress is now
talking of limiting foreign investment.
   Acquisitions by outsiders are possible in West Germany. In
fact, last year was a record one for foreign takeovers of
West German businesses, although this was in large part
because sales completed by the end of 1989 fell under a
favorable tax provision.
   But change in the West German takeover market is coming
slowly, and obstacles remain formidable. In Britain, whose
economy is 50% smaller than West Germany's, the total value
of acquisitions by outsiders last year was about four times
as great. This year, with the tax advantage gone, foreign
takeovers in West Germany are down.
   While most countries use government intervention to keep
foreigners out, West Germany -- like Japan -- also has an
extensive set of unwritten cultural and business practices.
Government barriers will fall with EC integration, but West
Germany's cultural barriers won't.
   "It is a closed country, very nationalistic, without a
takeover market," says Pierre Conso, chairman of Ciments
Francais. "The context isn't very favorable for development."
   West German bankers and officials, who pride themselves on
favoring free trade, generally reject accusations of
protectionism. "I think Germans have learned to open
themselves to cooperation and financial deals," says Hans
Dahm, who heads mergers and acquisitions activity at
Westdeutsche Landesbank. But he acknowledges that the German
system is hard for outsiders to understand.
   Only about 500 West German companies, for example, are
traded on stock exchanges, one-fourth as many as in Britain,
according to Deutsche Bank. And most of those are controlled
by families or institutions, including Deutsche Bank itself,
the country's largest bank. Deutsche Bank estimates that
friendly companies and banks alone hold 56% of all shares in
West Germany's listed companies and that family holders
account for still more. That concentration of control, along
with a variety of anti-takeover mechanisms, makes takeovers
in West Germany almost impossible, even for German raiders.
   "A few years ago, we reached a preliminary agreement to
buy a West German family-owned company," says one French
industrialist. "Then the family patriarch got a call from a
local competitor who said, `You can't let that company fall
into French hands.' The patriarch worried that he wouldn't be
able to hold his head up in town if he sold to us. He sold to
his competitor -- at the same price he had agreed with us.
They didn't even go through the cosmetic exercise of boosting
the price."
   Acquisition specialists say that West Germany isn't as
hard to penetrate as Japan. But as in Japan, companies in
West Germany tend to be viewed by both owners and local
authorities as a part of the community, with obligations that
go beyond making profits.
   "The German entrepreneur isn't just selling for money,"
says Mr. Dahm of Westdeutsche Landesbank. "He has a close
relationship with his company, with the community. We
regularly see American, Japanese and British companies being
frustrated because their targets won't sell out, even though
they are waving a large amount of money."
   Europeans who have managed to gain strong footholds in
West Germany sometimes see themselves as exceptions. "We have
been in Germany since 1865," says an official at the French
glassmaker Cie. de Saint-Gobain, which owns extensive West
German factories. "We have key Germans on our board,
including Deutsche Bank. Things are different for us."
   The close intertwining between big companies and their
banks also makes it hard for outsiders to get a foot in the
door. Bankers often are asked to sit on their customers'
supervisory boards, which gives them both special influence
and advance notice of company plans. Foreigners simply don't
benefit from that.
   Some companies hope to enter the West German market by the
back door, by setting up joint ventures in East Germany and
expanding west after unification. But so far, non-German
companies are well behind their West German rivals in East
Germany as well. In June, statistics indicated that of the
1,900 joint ventures created in East Germany since the end of
January, 95% had been set up by West German concerns.
   The EC already has told West Germany that it must open its
businesses -- notably banking and insurance -- to broader
competition. More recently, EC Competition Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan has warned that mergers of East and West German
companies arranged behind the backs of non-German companies
will be subject to rejection by EC authorities.
