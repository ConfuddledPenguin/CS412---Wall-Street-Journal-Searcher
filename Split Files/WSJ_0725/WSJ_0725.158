   PITTSBURGH -- The stocky, 72-year-old woman with the
bouffant hairdo marches to the back of the butcher shop and
demands a cut of steak.
   "Sorry, Sophie," the butcher apologizes. "I don't have
porterhouse. Is strip steak OK?"

   "All right," she barks. "But make sure it's good, or I'll
have the department of health down here."
   The butcher might dismiss that as an idle threat from a
fussy grandmother who looks as if she might spend her days
playing Bingo or feeding stale bread to pigeons.
   But she is the mayor of Pittsburgh.
   Master of the malapropism and patron of pickled herring,
Mayor Sophie Masloff has brought a new flavor to Pittsburgh
politics. She goes bargain-hunting with her staff in the
wholesale market. She instructs aides in Yiddish expressions.
And when Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Bubby Brister throws
a touchdown pass, she cheers for "Bobby Brewster."
   People here love her antics. In this age of colorless
politicians, Sophie -- as everybody calls her -- proves that
being outspoken and ethnic works in this meat-and-potatoes
city. Many Pittsburghers take pride in a mayor who wheels
like a Mack truck and defends their turf.
   When Beazer PLC of Britain took over a local chemical
company, Sophie said that if she ever met the company's
chairman, Brian Beazer, she would "scratch his eyes out."
Hearing that, Councilwoman Michelle Madoff, a current
supporter of the mayor, complained that Sophie had "set the
women's movement back 50 years."
   Criticism of that sort hardly matters to Sophie, whose
style is entirely her own. She wears thick red lipstick and
heavy round glasses that make her eyes look funny. She sticks
her chin out defiantly and walks with short, choppy steps.
Her hair has been likened to an auburn helmet. Jack Scheffo,
her hairdresser of 31 years, says he tried something more
contemporary with her a few years ago, but "it was a
disaster. She couldn't handle it."
   Sophie's arrival on the mayoral scene was something of a
fluke. She was on the city council for 12 years. (The
Democrats ran her as a reward for three decades' service as a
petty clerk in a county court.) Despite an unspectacular
council record, she ran for council president in January
1988, on the advice of then-Mayor Richard Caliguiri, and she
won. Mr. Caliguiri died unexpectedly in May, leaving Sophie
his job.
   Last year, she won a four-year term of her own. At first,
no one thought she had a chance: She didn't even have the
Democratic endorsement. But the two frontrunners attacked
each other and self-destructed. Sophie sneaked in with just
28% of the primary vote. And she ran unopposed in the general
election.
   Her tenure has been quite a trip for Pittsburgh. When
Bruce Springsteen came to town for a concert, Sophie called
him "Bruce Bedspring." When the Grateful Dead played Three
Rivers Stadium, she insisted the "Dreadful Dead" had no
business being here, and neither did their notorious
"hangerers on-ers," whom she called "Deadenders."
   Some of this word play clearly is deliberate; it simply
could not be otherwise.
   Finally, she did her answer to an Abbott and Costello
routine when she appeared at a stadium concert committee
meeting asking when "the How" were coming to town.
   "Not the How, the Who," an official advised her.
   "The who?" she asked.
   "Yes," he said.
   "Is there a Who group and a How group?" she persisted.
"Somebody asked me the other day if the How was coming here."
   "Who the hell is the How?" demanded a state senator.
   Sophie's casual relationship with details goes beyond rock
music to matters even more mundane. Like how old she is. When
KDKA-TV reporter Paul Martino asked Sophie her age during
last year's campaign, she told him she was born in December
1918, and was 70 years old. But Mr. Martino, the Sam
Donaldson of local television, informed her that she was 71.
Hours later, her office issued a statement that indeed she
was born in 1917, which made her 71 after all.
   The press actually has found it hard to be tough on
Sophie. "People don't like you picking on a nice, 70-ish
woman, however old she is," says Mr. Martino, who was
"resoundingly booed," he says, for pressing the mayor on the
age gap.
   The mayor does endearing things, such as keeping photos of
Mr. Martino's children (along with dozens of others) behind
her desk, next to her "Happiness Is Being a Grandmother"
plaque. (She has two grandchildren of her own.) "I can't
stand him, but I love his kids," she says of Mr. Martino.
   Sophie's agenda is equally domestic. She dwells on the
city's appearance as if Pittsburgh were an unkempt child.
Driving through a seedy downtown area, she brags that the
streets are swept two or three times a night. "I insist on
cleanliness," she says.
   One of her biggest triumphs as mayor has been to cut the
city's wage tax. She wants to lure younger families back from
the suburbs by shifting some of the load to real-estate taxes
-- a tactic that enraged her senior-citizen constituency.
When she discovered that Pittsburgh banks weren't making many
small mortgage loans, she told them the city wouldn't do
business with them unless they stepped up such lending.
   "She's very motherly, and she isn't into oratory," says
Don Stone, professor of public affairs at Carnegie Mellon
University. "She's just a plodder with very good motives and
principles."
   Though nobody seems to question her motives, some wonder
whether she has the vision the city needs to come to grips
with a population hemorrhage in the 1980s and a jolting shift
from manufacturing to a service economy. She limits her
involvement in policy-making to choosing from among options
her staff presents. And she hasn't been able to maintain the
close relationships her predecessors had with Pittsburgh's
business leaders.
   "She's doing a fine job, and the city is running well,"
says state Sen. Tom Murphy, the second-place finisher in last
year's mayoral primary. "But there's some concern about the
future. She has no vision."
   An awkward public speaker who suffers from stage fright,
she has trouble not just getting words right but facts
straight. In a Chamber of Commerce breakfast this year, for
example, she boasted about a nonexistent reconstruction of a
downtown street.
   Her staff, to manage the damage of spontaneity, now has
her read prepared statements, a la Ronald Reagan, then ushers
her off the stage before she can respond to questions. When
she speaks, she relies heavily on notes.
   In an editorial-board meeting with a local newspaper
during the campaign, the mayor came in with the word
"aspirations" written in three-quarter-inch red letters on
the back of her hand, presumably to remind herself of her
campaign slogan: "Grandmothers have no ambitions for
themselves, only aspirations for their children and
grandchildren."
   By her own admission, she is more interested in people
than in policy. She spends a lot of time among her
constituents -- working the crowds on city streets, greeting
people with a high-pitched "Hi, how are ya?" spoken, of
course, with a Pittsburgh accent.
   "I don't want the appearance of getting away from the
people," the mayor says between bites of crabcake at a
stand-up lunch in a wholesale fish market. "I want to be one
of them. I want them to feel I belong."
   Her aides say they are astounded by her energy, as she
drags them along on one of her weekly shopping trips through
the Strip District, Pittsburgh's answer to New York's Lower
East Side. Of her aides, she says, "They told me, `I'll do
anything you want, but I won't carry your purse.' But they
carry my purse."
   Her staff calls that "the handoff." It occurs whenever she
spots a baby or a nice cut of meat.
