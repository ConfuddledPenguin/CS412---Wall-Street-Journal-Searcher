   Investors again picked their way through the carnage of
the over-the-counter market as anemic earnings outlooks
continued to bleed individual stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.08 to 442.56, a 0.5%
drop, compared with the 0.6% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Volume fell to 160.5 million shares from 168.9
million shares Monday. The gap between declining and
advancing stocks narrowed, as 1,035 issues fell and 916 rose.
However, 161 stocks hit new lows and only 30 climbed to new
highs.

   The day's most active issue, American depositary receipts
of Reuters PLC, plummeted 10 to 56 1/4 on 9.1 million ADRs
after the London publishing and information concern said it
doesn't expect its growth rate for the remainder of the year
to keep pace with the first half.
   Technology shares crumbled amid nervousness about future
earnings and gross profit margins. Microsoft tumbled 2 1/2 to
69 1/2; Maxtor slid 3 5/8 to 10 3/4, and Intel fell 1 1/8 to
43 3/8. The Nasdaq Industrial Index fell 2.34 to 477.02, a
0.5% decline.
   "People are taking profits, but new investors are very
hard to find," explained Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of
world-wide equities for Shearson Lehman Hutton. Portfolio
managers pleased with their first-half gains in technology
and growth stocks are taking their profits and investing them
in the new-issues market and fixed income instruments, he
said. "The easy money is out of the market now," said Mr. Da
Puzzo. "It will take a lot of work by analysts and portfolio
managers to make money."
   The remainder of this quarter will be "a difficult
environment" for OTC investors, he added. Another heavy round
of selling triggered by program trading, a string of bad
earnings reports or a slight increase in interest rates could
set off yet another plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, he said.
   Yet the brokerage firm's analysts continue to estimate
that technology and selected emerging growth stocks will
outperform the market by year end, he said. "We haven't
changed our tune yet," he said, adding that opportunities are
being created by the broad scale pressure on those shares.
   Intel, the day's second most active stock, fell 1 1/8 to
43 3/8 on more than seven million shares. Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said that analysts attributed
the decline to a Reuters report that executives of the Santa
Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker told analysts in a meeting
they were concerned that its currently high gross profit
margins from microprocessors weren't sustainable "in the near
future."
   However, an Intel spokeswoman said that the report
incorrectly gave the timetable for the expected profit margin
decline, which had been discussed previously with analysts.
Alan G. Rieper of Cowen &amp; Co. and Thomas A. Thornhill III of
Montgomery Securities said they continue to recommend
purchase of Intel shares.
   Shares of Maxtor, a San Jose, Calif., maker of disk
drives, tumbled after several analysts lowered their earnings
estimates for the remainder of the year, according to
Professional Investor Report. Maxtor reported late Monday net
income for the first quarter ended June 30 of 30 cents a
share, up from 10 cents a year earlier. Analysts said those
results were on the low end of their expectations and added
they were even more concerned by the erosion of Maxtor's
gross profit margins during the first quarter.
   Investors didn't spare software leader Microsoft, which is
expected to report earnings for the fourth quarter, ended
last month, this afternoon. Traders and analysts attributed a
more than four-point intraday fall in Microsoft shares to
nervousness about guidance the company might give analysts in
a conference call scheduled for tomorrow morning. Thomas A.
Galvin, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham analyst, told
Professional Investor Report he doesn't expect any
disappointments and is estimating earnings of 64 cents a
share, up from 40 cents a share a year earlier.
   Shares of two other technologies companies, which reported
earnings after the market closed, fared slightly better, but
traders said they weren't sure how the stocks would perform
this morning. Chips &amp; Technology was unchanged at 17 1/2. The
San Jose, Calif., maker of microcomputer chips reported net
income for the fourth quarter ended June 30 of 41 cents a
share, down from 65 cents a share a year earlier.
   According to First Call, a Thompson Financial Networks
service, average analysts' estimates for the company ranged
from 40 cents to 44 cents a share.
   Seagate Technology eased 3/8 to 12 3/8. After the close,
the Scotts Valley, Calif., maker of computer magnetic disk
drives reported net income for the fourth quarter ended June
30 of 46 cents a share was flat with a year earlier. Analysts
estimates ranged from 51 cents to 54 cents a share, according
to First Call.
   Urcarco slid 2 to 11 7/8 on 1.9 million shares after the
Fort Worth, Texas, seller of used cars said it expects July
car sales will be down 10% to 15%.
   Positive earnings shored up a few stocks. Cognex jumped 2
1/4 to 32 1/4 after the Needham, Mass., maker of machine
vision systems reported net income for the second quarter
ended July 1 rose to 36 cents a share from 22 cents a share a
year earlier.
   Medical Graphics gained 7/8 to 4 3/8 after the company
reported net income for the second quarter of seven cents a
share, compared with a loss of 10 cents a share a year
earlier.
