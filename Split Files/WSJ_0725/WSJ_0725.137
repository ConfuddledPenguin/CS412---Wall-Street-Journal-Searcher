   Ivaco Inc., a Montreal-based steelmaker, said it agreed to
sell two wholly owned subsidiaries to a unit of BTR PLC, a
British holding company, in a transaction that would reduce
Ivaco's long-term debt by about 125 million Canadian dollars
(US$108.2 million).
   Ivaco declined to disclose terms of the transaction, but
reports from London said BTR agreed to pay US$112 million.
The two Ivaco subsidiaries operate plants in the U.S. and
Canada that make fabrics used in the paper-making industry.

   The transaction, which requires approval by U.S. and
Canadian regulators, would result in a pretax gain of about
C$30 million, Ivaco said. Ivaco had 1989 profit of C$12.9
million, after a C$19.8 million one-time charge and a C$4.3
million loss on discontinued operations. On Dec. 31, it had
long-term debt of C$550.6 million.
