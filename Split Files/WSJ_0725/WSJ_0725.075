   In your July 13 lead editorial, "Environmental Balance,"
you correctly summarize some of my conclusions about the
likely benefits and costs of the clean-air legislation now
before Congress.
   In doing so, however, you refer to me as "a leading
environmentalist." While I do care deeply about the
environment, the term "environmentalist" is almost always
reserved for members of environmental-advocacy organizations.
I believe your editorial creates the impression that I speak
for those groups, and that is quite unfair to them since they
may disagree strongly with my conclusions.
