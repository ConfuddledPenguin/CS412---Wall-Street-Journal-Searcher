   TOKYO -- NKK Corp. will form a linkup with Raycom Systems
Inc., based in Boulder, Colo., to manufacture and sell
Raycom's high-speed, fiber-optic computer networking systems
in Japan.
   NKK will begin selling one of Raycom's Local Area Networks
in August under the name Transway, NKK said. The system links
smaller computer networks, allowing large volumes of data to
be exchanged at high speeds.
