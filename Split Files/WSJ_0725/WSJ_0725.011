   PARSIPPANY, N.J. -- Armco Inc. reported an expected
second-quarter loss as a result of a series of unusual
charges, combined with poor results from steel operations.
   The loss totaled $85.1 million, or 98 cents a share, which
contrasted with net income of $75.6 million, or 84 cents a
share, a year earlier. In the 1989 quarter, Armco had a large
gain on the sale of most of its carbon steel operations to a
joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp. of Japan.

   Armco said it expects to be profitable for the second
half, but didn't make a specific forecast.
   Armco said that excluding unusual items in both years, the
company had a second-quarter loss of $5.7 million, compared
with profit of $33.7 million in the year-earlier period.
   Armco said its board will decide Friday whether to
continue paying the 10 cent quarterly dividend. As previously
reported, provisions of the 13.5% senior notes due in 1994
could prevent Armco from paying a dividend on common stock
after the loss.
   Sales for the quarter were $457.2 million, down from
$665.6 million a year earlier. The 1989 quarter's sales
included $204.3 million from Armco's former Eastern Steel
division.
   The latest quarter included unusual charges of $30 million
for Armco's finance and insurance runoff companies and
charges of $15 million for federal tax assessments for prior
years. Other charges totaling $56 million resulted from a
breach-of-contract suit against Armco in Houston, a judgment
against Armco in Minnesota and other litigation and claims.
   Partly offsetting those charges, the company had gains of
$3.5 million on the sale of a tubing plant in Wildwood, Fla.,
and $18.1 million on the sale of an additional 5% ownership
of Armco Steel Co. L.P. to Kawasaki Steel.
   For the first half, Armco had a net loss of $72.2 million,
or 86 cents a share, in contrast to profit of $116.5 million,
or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. Six-month sales were $903.1
million, down from $1.57 billion a year earlier.
