   Wall Street's tremors left Asian-Pacific markets largely
unscathed yesterday.
   And in London, stocks finished narrowly mixed in modest
trading as an anticipated early advance on Wall Street failed
to materialize.

   Investors in Asian and Pacific markets were mostly
unperturbed by Monday's volatile trading in New York, which
sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 100
points soon after the market opened.
   Although the industrial average ended with a 56.44-point
loss, regional markets for the most part followed their own
local influences.
   Only Hong Kong and New Zealand had sharp falls yesterday.
Hong Kong's decline of nearly 2%, the largest drop in the
region, was cast in a relatively positive light. The chief
explanation was that a correction was overdue after the
market's prolonged rally.
   "This is a rather useful buying opportunity," said Peter
Everington, investment director at Thornton Management
(Asia).
   New Zealand shares slid 1.6%. Investors were worried not
only by the cloud over Wall Street but by the impending
disclosure of the Wellington government's budget. Singapore
stocks fell 0.7%.
   Illustrating its isolation from foreign events, Taiwan's
stock market rebounded strongly after plunging the previous
day. Its Weighted Price Index surged 5.6%. Likewise, South
Korean shares responded to internal influences, falling
slightly amid continuing concern over political instability.
   In Tokyo, high long-term and short-term interest rates
dried up buying interest, traders said.
   Prices finished well above midday lows, however, after
fluctuating widely at lower levels throughout the day.
Traders said thin volume permitted index-linked trading --
including that by arbitragers -- to sway stocks more widely
than normal.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index eased another 22.72
points to close the morning session at 31679.74.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index
rebounded 143.44 points to 31845.90.
   Reports Tuesday that U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf
were on alert as Iraq moved 30,000 troops to its border with
Kuwait pressured Tokyo stock prices, traders said. They
explained that stocks fall because of weakened bond prices
resulting from a belief that the situation might strengthen
the dollar.
   By the end of the day, most investors concluded that the
tension is unlikely to worsen, said Yoshihiro Ito, general
manager of stock trading at Okasan Securities. He said Iraq's
move appeared to be aimed at pressuring Kuwait to agree to
oil-production cuts at the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries meeting that starts in Geneva tomorrow.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 350 million
shares, up from 302 million Monday. Decliners outnumbered
advancers 774-205, with 144 issues unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index posted a sharper decline than
the Nikkei index, falling 25.33 points, or 1.09%, to 2304.59.
   The Second Section Index dropped 30.88 points, or 0.71%,
to 4329.23. Volume was estimated at 15.6 million shares, up
from 13.5 million Monday.
   "All the market attention is focused on interest rates,"
said Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at
Nikko Securities.
   While a broad range of sectors declined, resource shares
such as petroleum and mining companies firmed, as they often
do when the market loses its focus of trade, traders said.
   In addition, petroleum shares attracted investors on
expectation that OPEC nations will agree on an oil production
cut, traders said.
   Nippon Oil gained 40 yen to 1,480 yen (27 cents to $9.97).
Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting was the day's most active issue,
finishing at 858, up 30.
   Sony and Kyocera, which have been bought heavily this
month, received blocks of sell orders from institutions,
traders said. Sony was down 80 at 8,720, while Kyocera fell
140 to 8,860.
   In London, stocks shot higher from the outset, bouncing
back from day-earlier losses that dealers said were overdone.
But the gains were scaled back on an uninspired Wall Street
start, the dealers added.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
up 1.2 points at 2360.9 after hitting a midmorning peak of
2378.1 and a midafternoon minimum of 2351.8.
   The Financial Times 30-Share Index eased 0.4 point to
1866.7. Volume was a mild 385.7 million shares, little
changed from 369.8 million Monday.
   Reuters Holdings plummeted #1.84 to #10.45 ($3.36 to
$19.09) on volume of 5.7 million shares.
   Although the news and financial information group reported
interim results just below the best of market expectations,
the stock was clobbered by the company's disclosure that
"conditions in financial markets remain difficult and
cancellations of Reuter services, which were already high,
have recently risen further."
   "In the market's current frame of mind, it's in no mood
for more setbacks, particularly in regard to service
industries," one market professional said. The stock has been
a good performer lately and was prone to a setback on any
earnings disappointment, he said.
   Oil issues rose across the board. British Petroleum gained
7 pence to 340 pence, Enterprise added 14 to 676, Lasmo
advanced 14 to 448, Shell Transport &amp; Trading rose 7 to 489,
and Ultramar gained 4 to 343.
   Water stocks continued to perform well. Against a
background of uncertainty over profits, corporate downgrades,
currency fluctuations and erratic movements on Wall Street,
the sector was seen as one of the most secure and stable in
the U.K. market, traders said.
   The market's package of 10 water stocks rose 65 to #22.58,
Thames Water gained 6 to 228, Anglian Water advanced 7 to
228, Severn Trent added 6 to 210, and Southern Water rose 8
to 207.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Paris and Madrid, lower
in Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich, and
mixed in Brussels. South African gold stocks closed firmer.
