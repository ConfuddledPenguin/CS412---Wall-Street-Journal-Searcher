   Gerald F. Seib in his June 18 Washington Insight story
referred to Jordan as "once-moderate Jordan . . ." thus
joining a certain chorus of the Western media that recently
have been marketing the idea of a radicalized Jordan.
   The complications facing the Bush administration peace
efforts begin and end with Israel. The attempt to introduce
the false notion of a "once-moderate Jordan" and to describe
King Hussein as spouting anti-American, anti-Israeli rhetoric
amounts to nothing more than an attempt to dilute Israeli
rejectionism.

   No single person has warned of extremists and extremism as
much or as long as King Hussein has. No single country
throughout the years of the Arab-Israeli conflict
demonstrated and advocated a course of moderation,
pragmatism, realism and reason as Jordan has. No single
people shouldered responsibilities that heavily outweighed
their capabilities for the cause of peace in our region as
have the Jordanian people.
   Only recently and on more than one occasion, King Hussein
reiterated Jordan's commitment to continue the search for a
just and lasting peace in our region. It is this that counts
and not the misguided interpretations and utterances directed
against Jordan, which only play into the hands of those who
seek to derail the chances of peace in our region.
