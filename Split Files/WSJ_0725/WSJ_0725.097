   General Tire, an Akron, Ohio-based unit of Continental AG
of West Germany, said it is raising prices on private-brand
tires by 2% to 4%, effective Sept. 4.
   Most U.S. tire makers, including General, previously
announced similar price increases on replacement tires that
they sell under their own brand names. General's increase
becomes effective Aug. 1.

<TEXT>
   The new move by General extends that increase to tires
sold to major wholesalers, mass merchandisers and other
concerns that contract with tire manufacturers to produce
tires for them under private brands.
   Replacement tire prices have been discounted more than
usual this year because the auto production slowdown created
a tire surplus.
