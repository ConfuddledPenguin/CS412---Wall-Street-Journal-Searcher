   I do not understand why so many Americans believe Japanese
direct investment in the U.S. is too much and dangerous
("Strained Alliance" series, page one, June 19 segment). Such
investment is good for the U.S. economy. It is not a Japanese
invasion nor this country's defeat by the Japanese.
   And there are many Americans who benefit, especially those
who sold properties to Japanese investors. And there is this
to remember: Real-estate properties cannot be physically
moved; they are not something the Japanese investors can
bring home. You should not worry about the nationality of
your landlord because it does not affect the nature of the
property.

   U.S. real-estate properties are attractive to Japanese
investors because they give a higher return and more value
than those in Japan. Also, it is logical and desirable for
the U.S. to encourage foreign direct investment, which brings
a fair amount of foreign money into the U.S.
   Considering the fact that the U.S. real-estate market is
slow, I believe it is good for the U.S. economy to encourage
the Japanese to invest in the U.S. and let Japanese money
compensate for this slow-market situation.

   Your June 19 installment stated that "Fujitsu has no
Americans in top management." I and my colleagues were
greatly amused to learn that we were not members of senior
management. As a Fujitsu America board member, chairman of
Fujitsu America's North American data-storage research
subsidiary, Intellistor, and president of Fujitsu's largest
products group, Norman Petersen, for example, is certainly a
member of senior management even by the narrowest of
standards. I, myself, am a senior vice president of Fujitsu
America, have run two Fujitsu subsidiary companies and am a
board member of Fujitsu America subsidiary companies.
   At Fujitsu America, 49 members of our top-management team
-- vice-president level and above -- are American. This is a
particular point of pride for Fujitsu.
   While some foreign-owned companies may be struggling to
Americanize their U.S. operations, we at Fujitsu America take
great pride in our continuing progress.

   In the June 15 segment, you mentioned the almost
"adversarial" attitude of the younger generation of Japanese
toward the U.S. This is a dangerous attitude that must be
corrected soon if we are to avoid future conflict. Much of
the blame should be placed on the shoulders of Japanese
educators, who for many years now have tried to distort and
cover up the causes and hard facts of World War II. In
effect, they are lying to the younger generations. Now, many
of these people who will one day take over the reins of
government know only about the atomic bombing of their cities
by the U.S., but do not know much about their own aggression
and their brutal suppression of the hapless civilians the
imperial army conquered 50 years ago.
   The younger generation sees Japan only as the "victim" in
the war, and subconsciously may want to get even.

   How would the Japanese have treated America if they had
struck first with atomic weapons, devastated our towns and
industries, won the war and occupied our country? Would they
have saved and honored our chief of state, restored our
institutions, rebuilt our economy and subsidized and
protected us? Not likely. That may be one good reason for our
distrust of the Japanese.
   As to their economic success, why should we begrudge them
that? We set them up and got them going. Now, their main
offense is that they have found out what our consumers want
and are filling our needs expertly. If they can do that they
should make money and we should learn some lessons from them.
We need tough competition to make us improve our own game.

   The June 13 sidebar implied, as many have recently, that
the U.S. savings rate is substantially below that of Japan's
(5.4% to 16.8%). If you increase U.S. savings by adding
Social Security contributions, the savings rates are much
closer (15% to 16.8%). An additional adjustment could be made
for residential-property enhancements, which Americans think
of as savings but national income accounting reports as gross
private investment. In addition, putting a dollar figure on
the unaccounted-for time and money Americans invest in their
homes would also increase the U.S. savings rate.
   A second common misrepresentation concerns Japan's gross
private domestic investment as a percentage of gross national
product being higher than that of the U.S. (25.7% to 14.8%).
The U.S. invests 6% of GNP in defense, compared with 1% for
Japan, so the adjusted figures are 26.7% and 20.8%. These
figures were about equal until 1984, when Japan suddenly
increased its investment rate.
   The problem is not the amount of saving and investment but
their applications. The U.S. is wealthy and can afford to
make large investments in defense and residential
construction. In addition, the U.S. made the political
decision to raise the standard of living of its elderly and
almost tripled Social Security taxes during the past decade.
While important, these expenditures do not increase our
nation's productive capabilities. Until recently, Japan has
not been wealthy enough to defend itself, and being land-poor
its citizens do not put comparable time and money into
residential construction. As a result, Japan's investments
have been directed toward areas that do increase future
productive capabilities. The two nations must understand the
causes for their different economic-growth rates. Decisions
must be made over the next decade to ensure that these growth
rates eventually converge. Competitive cooperation and not
adversarial animosity must rule.
