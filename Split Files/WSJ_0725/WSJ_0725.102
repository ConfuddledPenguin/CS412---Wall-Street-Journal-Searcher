   Ryder System Inc. posted nearly flat earnings for its
second quarter, breaking a yearlong string of steep declines
in profit and signaling that the company might be poised for
a turnaround.
   Ryder reported second-quarter net income of $32.1 million,
or 39 cents a share, compared with $32.4 million, or 40 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue inched up to $1.31 billion
from $1.29 billion.

   M. Anthony Burns, chief executive officer of the
Miami-based transportation-services concern, said Ryder
expects to show a solid profit in the third quarter, compared
with a net loss of $27.6 million, or 38 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period, including a $57 million after-tax
charge.
   The second-quarter results, analysts said, offered
evidence that a seven-point "profit improvement plan"
initiated by the company last year is starting to pay off.
   In line with its plan to slash costs, Ryder has sold eight
businesses in the past year and a half, Mr. Burns said.
Further divestitures are possible.
