   Honeywell Inc., inching closer to a spinoff of its defense
and marine systems business, said holders would receive one
share of the new company for every four shares of Honeywell
common owned.
   The Minneapolis-based electronic controls and components
concern said that while directors aren't expected to formally
approve the spinoff until late this quarter, the proposed
company would be called Alliant Techsystems Inc. And it would
seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

   Honeywell also announced a senior management slate for
Alliant Techsystems, led by Toby G. Warson, formerly chief
executive officer of Honeywell's U.K. unit. Last year, the
defense and marine systems business reported sales of $1.1
billion.
   Honeywell said it still is awaiting a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service that a spinoff would be tax-free to
its holders.
   Spinning off its weapons business, at a time of
anticipated decline in government military spending, is part
of a Honeywell strategy to increase shareholder value.
