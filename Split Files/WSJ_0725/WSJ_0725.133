   LONDON -- Merrill Lynch International Ltd. has stopped
making a market in U.S. dollar-denominated Japanese
equity-warrant issues, a spokesman for the firm said.
   "We were unable to make a sufficient return on our capital
as the market is suffering from excess capacity and increased
competition," said the spokesman for the Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
unit.

   About 30 staff members have been laid off, including
traders, salespeople and administrative employees. Merrill
has a staff of about 2,100 across Europe, with more than
1,400 based in London.
   The firm entered the business in November 1988, and was a
market maker in 250 to 300 issues, representing roughly
three-quarters of all liquid issues oustanding.
   Merrill will continue to make a market in Swiss-franc
denominated equity-warrant bond issues by Japanese companies.
It is a market maker in about 150 Swiss franc issues, the
official said.
   The official added that Merrill will continue to be
involved in customer agency business and will also continue
to trade in U.S. dollar equity-warrant deals in connection
with its arbitrage and derivative activity.
   The cuts are part of Merrill's current business
rationalization process. According to the spokesman, the firm
now intends to concentrate on the equity derivatives
business.
