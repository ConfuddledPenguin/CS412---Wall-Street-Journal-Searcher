   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is telling dealers
it plans to raise prices on its restyled 1991 minivans by as
much as 12% but will cut prices on some of its less popular
car lines.
   The No. 3 U.S. auto maker's preliminary pricing strategy
was outlined in price lists designed to allow dealers to
begin taking fleet orders now. A company spokesman stressed
yesterday that 1991 retail models could have different levels
of standard equipment and possibly different prices than
those indicated for fleet buyers.

   Still, Chrysler's preliminary pricing strategy for the
fall represents a partial break with the more traditional
approach outlined by Ford Motor Co. Ford recently told
dealers it plans to raise prices broadly on most 1991 models
by between 4% and 9%. General Motors Corp. is expected to
release its preliminary 1991 prices soon.
   Chrysler isn't proposing to raise prices across the board
but instead is signaling that it will place big increases on
models that are selling well and balance those by cutting or
holding prices of lower-volume lines and models that are
under tougher competitive pressure.
   "About half {the models} have gone up, and half have gone
down," the Chrysler spokesman said.
   Chrysler plans some of its biggest price increases for its
1991 minivans, which it says will arrive this fall with new
interiors and more refined exterior looks. The minivans are a
key source of profit for Chrysler, and Chrysler's 1991
pricing appears aimed at recovering the expense of the
restyling and more, despite mounting competition in the small
van market.
   The base price of the least expensive Plymouth Voyager
minivan is scheduled to go up $1,076 to $13,071, a 9%
increase from last fall. The better-equipped and more popular
Voyager SE model is scheduled to go up $1,525, or 12%, to
$14,200. The most expensive two-wheel drive Voyager, the
Grand Voyager LE, will start at $19,300, up 5.3% from a year
ago. The price increases reflect, in part, some new standard
equipment, the company spokesman said.
   In addition, Chrysler will launch all-wheel drive versions
of the minivans this fall. Starting prices on these models
will range from $17,089 to $21,146.
   At these prices, however, Chrysler's minivans could
represent less of a bargain compared with models from Ford,
GM, Toyota Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. Toyota's Previa
LE model, which is comparable in size and features to a Grand
Caravan LE, currently starts at $18,698, compared with
$18,325 for the current Grand Caravan. But the proposed base
price of the 1991 Grand Caravan is $602 higher than the
Previa's. Toyota hasn't announced whether it will raise the
price of the Previa.
   "One of the reasons Voyager is so successful is that it
was in the lower price range" among minivans, said Longview,
Wash., Chrysler dealer Jim Clary. "Chrysler may be losing
their advantage. Price is a big thing in that people-carrier
business."
   When it comes to cars, Chrysler's 1991 pricing strategy is
more complicated. For example, the base price for the least
expensive 1991 Plymouth Laser coupe is tentatively set at
$10,864, just $9 more than a year earlier. But the starting
price of the more popular and better-equipped 1991 Laser RS
model is scheduled to jump $870 to $12,770, up 7.3% from last
fall.
   In a few cases, Chrysler is cutting base prices of car
models. The 1991 New Yorker Fifth Avenue is tentatively
priced to start at $20,550, down 1.5% from the year-earlier
$20,860 starting price. The most expensive 1991 Chrysler
LeBaron convertible will start at $17,625, down $2,427 or 12%
from a year earlier.
