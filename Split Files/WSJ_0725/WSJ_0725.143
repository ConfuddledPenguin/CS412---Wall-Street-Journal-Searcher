   FIGHTING MALARIA

   The World Health Organization called for the "urgent
acceleration" of research into anti-malarial drugs and
vaccines.
   WHO said its appeal followed the recent discovery that
malarial parasites had developed resistance to the
anti-malarial drug mefloquine at the Thai-Cambodian border.
That discovery was "particularly disturbing as we have some
evidence that these (malaria) parasites are also resistant to
other drugs not yet used in the area such as halofantrine,"
said Tore Godal, a WHO official involved in tropical-disease
research.
   WHO estimates that there are 110 million new malaria cases
a year but that about 270 million people may be carrying the
malaria parasite; from one million to two million people die
each year from malaria and its complications.
   Dr. Godal said there is some cause for optimism. "A
vaccine blocking the transmission of human malaria is under
development," he said. "What we now need is to scale up the
production, complete toxicological studies and start studies
in human volunteers and in the field."
                                                                                                       

   DROP IN AIRBUS ORDERS
                                                                                                       

   Airbus Industrie said it recorded new firm orders for 118
of its commercial jets during the first half of 1990, down
sharply from 252 planes in the corresponding year-earlier
period. The European aircraft group said the year-earlier
total reflected a period of exceptionally brisk sales and
interpreted the 1990 first-half result as a sign of
"continuing strong demand for civil aircraft, albeit at a
more reasonable level for the industry."
                                                                                                       

   RADIO CONTROVERSY IN ISRAEL
                                                                                                       

   An Israeli state planning board approved construction in
the Negev desert of a Voice of America radio transmitter that
environmentalists had fought against. Conservationists, who
say the radio emissions could be harmful and disorient
millions of migratory birds, threatened to appeal to the
Supreme Court. The U.S. plans to use the transmitter to carry
programs of Voice of America and Radio Liberty to Eastern
Europe, Central Asia and Africa in 28 languages.
                                                                                                       

   ADVICE FOR AMERICANS ABROAD
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. State Department unveiled an "Americans Abroad"
brochure. Under the heading "What To Do If There Is an
Incident," the brochure's suggestions for dealing with
terrorists include: "Do not engage in political discussions"
and "Do not try to be a hero." A "Getting Ready" section
covers such topics as passports and insurance. The brochure
also suggests ways to avoid becoming a crime victim and warns
about harsh foreign laws. It is available, free, by writing
to: Americans Abroad, Pueblo, Colo. 81009.
                                                                                                       

   TRANS-SOVIET PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will participate in a $500 million
trans-Soviet telecommunication-cable project, the state-owned
Korea Telecommunication Authority said. The consortium behind
the project now consists of 11 agencies from 10 nations,
including the Soviet Union, the U.S., Japan and the United
Kingdom. The project will link South Korea and Japan to
Western Europe via the Soviet Union.
                                                                                                       

   PACIFIC PROTEST
                                                                                                       

   Pacific island leaders and environmental groups are
raising concerns about the U.S. Army's plan to move chemical
weapons from West Germany to Johnston Atoll, 800 miles
southwest of Honolulu. "Transporting the European stockpile
halfway around the world inescapably increases the risks,"
said the Federated States of Micronesia. The Marshall
Islands, Cook Islands, New Zealand and the U.S. territory of
American Samoa also have expressed reservations about the
plan. The Army said moving the weapons and destroying them at
Johnston Atoll would have minimal public-health, safety and
environmental effects.
                                                                                                       

   EC AND MONETARY UNION
                                                                                                       

   The wide economic differences between European Community
members could make it necessary for economic and monetary
union to be phased in at different speeds within the EC, a
growing number of EC officials believe.
   The EC's monetary committee presented this view in a
report to a meeting of EC finance ministers. The idea's
supporters include EC Commission President Jacques Delors,
according to EC sources.
   Mr. Delors insisted such an approach wouldn't mean the
creation of a "two-speed Europe," a prospect opposed firmly
by Britain, among others. "There is no question" of a
two-tier approach, said Italian Finance Minister Guido Carli.
   The approach in the committee's report calls for all EC
countries to agree simultaneously to the creation of a single
EC currency and central bank. But it would give some of them
a longer time to move toward that goal.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs are reviving in Eastern
Europe after decades of repression, the World Organization of
the Scout Movement said yesterday, after readmitting Hungary
and Czechoslovakia. . . . A student who threw a wet T-shirt
at Queen Elizabeth II during the British monarch's February
visit to New Zealand was sentenced to five months of
detention, which she will serve after school hours and on
weekends. Henearoahuea Tepou, a 27-year-old Maori, told a
district court that she had been protesting New Zealand's
treatment of its indigenous Maori population.
