   Eastern Airlines said it expects, as early as today, to be
indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that some
employees falsified aircraft maintenance records at New York
area airports a few years ago.
   The announcement in New York by Martin R. Shugrue Jr.,
Eastern's court-appointed trustee, is a clear attempt by the
carrier to limit any possible damage with prospective Eastern
fliers. The carrier's announcement evidently was aimed at
rebutting the government's arguments before the U.S. could
make them.

   It is unclear, however, whether the indictment, which has
seemed probable for months, will have much impact on
Eastern's current struggle to attract more passengers.
Industry officials say many fliers choose carriers more on
the basis of ticket prices than on safety concerns.
   Mr. Shugrue said weeks of negotiations over a plea bargain
on the charges had collapsed. He said Eastern had been
willing to plead guilty to charges that several years ago,
some employees engaged in "pencil whipping," or signing off
on work that wasn't actually performed, at Eastern's
maintenance bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport
and La Guardia Airport.
   The company balked when federal prosecutors insisted on
including in the pending indictment one count of conspiracy,
a charge Mr. Shugrue said would call into question Eastern's
current maintenance practices.
   "We cannot, and will not, plead guilty to that," said Mr.
Shugrue. "A conspiracy finding such as the U.S. attorney is
seeking would cause us to admit to systemic problems with
maintenance that I don't believe exist." The JFK maintenance
base has since been closed, and several supervisors were
disciplined.
   Mary Jo White, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of
the investigation, declined to comment.
   The inquiry centers on practices at the two airports
before the March 1989 machinists strike. According to
allegations first made by the International Association of
Machinists, some maintenance foremen, general foremen and
managers signed worksheets certifying that certain tasks had
been completed when, the machinists claimed, the work wasn't
done at all. Maintenance records are filed with the Federal
Aviation Administration and are considered federal records.
   Last September, Eastern agreed to a $1.9 million
settlement with the FAA that included charges that Eastern
failed to comply with requirements for making, retaining and
monitoring records at Kennedy Airport. Earlier, the FAA
determined that Eastern didn't routinely falsify records,
although the agency found "minor problems" with the airline's
records.
   Leonard Garment, an attorney for the bankruptcy judge in
the Eastern case, said plea-bargain talks broke down after
prosecutors put forward a proposed "bill of information" that
included accusations against management officials. "It
reached a point where Mr. Shugrue said, `this far and no
farther,' " Mr. Garment said.
   In two meetings he attended with representatives of the
U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, Mr. Garment said, he and
others present were told that Eastern had been targeted
because prosecutors believed the case could serve as an
example to the airline industry.
   Yesterday, Mr. Shugrue reiterated that the faulty
maintenance practices occurred some time ago when Eastern was
under different management. Mr. Shugrue took control in April
after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland ousted the
parent, the former Texas Air Corp., from day-to-day
management of the airline. Texas Air has since changed its
name to Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.
   "Eastern has many problems, {but} flying a safe airline
isn't one of them," Mr. Shugrue said. He called the
maintenance offenses "historical events" that have been
addresssed by the company and the FAA and that "bear no
resemblance and {have} no impact on Eastern today." Sixteen
months ago, Eastern sought bankruptcy court protection from
creditors after being practically grounded by labor strife.
   Mr. Shugrue said Eastern has terminated or reassigned
employees involved in "wrongdoing" and has closed the JFK
base. He added that in 1988, Eastern underwent two vigorous
inspections overseen by the FAA and the Department of
Defense. "If we weren't in compliance today, this company
wouldn't be flying," he said. Mr. Shugrue said that he hasn't
seen the list of those to be indicted but said any current
employees would be relieved of their duties pending
resolution of any charges. He didn't elaborate.
