   THE U.S. CONDUCTED a naval exercise in the Persian Gulf
amid rising tensions.
   Citing concern over an oil dispute between Iraq and
Kuwait, the Pentagon said U.S. warships had begun a
"short-notice" exercise with gulf forces of the United Arab
Emirates. Navy Secretary Garrett told a congressional panel
that U.S. ships were put on alert in the gulf. The Emirates
have been an implicit target of Iraq's complaints that some
of its Arab neighbors have been undercutting oil prices by
exceeding their OPEC production quotas. Kuwaiti sources said
Iraq had massed 30,000 troops and over 200 tanks along its
border with Kuwait. OPEC ministers gathered in Geneva for a
strategy session.

   A HOUSE PANEL URGED a prosecutor to widen the HUD probe of
Pierce.
   The House subcommittee asked the special prosecutor, Arlin
Adams, to investigate whether the former HUD secretary, his
old law firm and a onetime top aide violated federal bribery
and conspiracy laws. The panel said its own 14-month inquiry
had uncovered "widespread abuses, influence peddling, blatant
favoritism, monumental waste and gross mismanagement" during
Pierce's tenure under Reagan.
   The panel said Pierce didn't tell "the full story," adding
that some of his statements were "at odds with the sworn
testimony of other witnesses."

   Souter was briefed at the White House on the Senate

September.

   East Germany's small Liberal Party quit the seven-party

   The Khmer Rouge guerrillas asked for world support to end
Cambodia's war, saying they must have a role in any peace
accord. They were reacting to last week's U.S. decision to
withdraw Washington's recognition of the U.N. seat held by a
guerrilla coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge, which the
U.S. is attempting to isolate.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. action was criticized by Southeast Asian foreign
ministers on the first day of an annual meeting. The
ministers said efforts to change Cambodia's U.N. seat "would
set back the search for a comprehensive political solution."
Secretary of State Baker is planning to meet with the Asean
group in Indonesia next week.

and other embattled weapons.

line carrying water coolant to an engine.

recent months has escalated its terrorist attacks.

mansion.

   Gorbachev warned developing nations that aid the Kremlin
provides them will be reviewed to take into account "the real
capabilities of our country." The Soviet president's

signal to Cuba, one of Moscow's biggest aid recipients.
