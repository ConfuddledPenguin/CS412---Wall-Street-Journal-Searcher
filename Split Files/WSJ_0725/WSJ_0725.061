   LONDON -- Reuters Holdings PLC said first-half pretax
earnings rose 23% from a year earlier, but Reuters stock
plummeted 15% as the news and financial information company
said it wouldn't match that performance in the second half.
   Reuters attributed its forecast to an increasingly high
rate of customer cancellations of its services and to the
adverse impact of the strong pound.

   The forecast caused some analysts to lower their 1990
earnings estimates for the company, although they said they
still believed in its long-term growth potential.
   On London's stock exchange, Reuters fell #1.84 ($3.36) to
#10.45 ($19.09) a share on volume of 5.7 million shares. In
over-the-counter trading in the U.S., the company's American
depositary receipts plummeted $10 each, also a 15% drop, to
$56.25.
   The company said pretax profit was #167.1 million ($305.2
million), or 25.9 pence a share, compared with #135.9
million, or 20.6 pence a share. Sales grew 26% to #688.3
million from #548.3 million. Reuters declared a first-half
per-share dividend of 4.4 pence, up from 3.6 pence.
   "The recent stronger trend of sterling and high
cancellation rates will, if they persist, have a negative
impact," Glen Renfrew, chief executive officer, said. "On the
other hand, we have a large backlog of rental business to
install, and prospects remain good for outright sales of
trading-room systems. On balance, we expect continued good
growth but don't think growth rates for the full year will
match those of the first half."
   Company officials at a news conference declined to provide
figures on cancellations, but the company did report that the
number of customer teleprinter terminals declined to 4,161
from 4,956 during the first half. The number of video
terminals increased to 198,021 from 194,750.
   A strong pound makes British goods and services more
expensive and generally cuts demand by overseas customers.
   "Conditions in financial markets remain difficult, and
cancellations of Reuter services, which were already high,
have recently risen further, reflecting office and
departmental closures and economy drives by major clients,
including U.S. organizations with international networks,"
Mr. Renfrew said.
   He said cancellations were heaviest in Britain, the U.S.,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia. "Gross new orders have held
up well, but the net after cancellations, while still
substantial, has fallen below last year's level," Mr. Renfrew
said.
   Brian Sturgess, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities Ltd., said he reduced his 1990 Reuters pretax
profit forecast to #324 million from #355 million because of
the currency and cancellation factors and because "staff has
increased as the company builds up to a bigger product base."
The company earned #283.1 million in 1989.
   Reuters said staff increased about 5% to 10,522 persons in
the first half, with most of the increase in the technical,
sales and marketing areas.
   Mr. Sturgess said the expected secondhalf slowdown in
Reuters's earnings growth is "just a pause" in an expected
pattern of long-term growth.
