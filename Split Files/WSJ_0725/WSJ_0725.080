   RYE, N.Y. -- When it comes to houses, Frederick and Joyce
Schenker believe in love at first sight.
   The Schenkers were instantly smitten in 1976 by a
low-slung white house on a finger of land dipping into Long
Island Sound, here in affluent Westchester County north of
New York. "I love this house -- the setting, the feeling, the
room. It just flows," rhapsodizes Mr. Schenker, a 52-year-old
pharmacist.

   The house features slope-ceiling rooms linked by lower
hallways, surrounding a small courtyard. It was built by a
widow as a kind of "coping" cottage behind the big colonial
she had shared with her husband. The architect, Russell
Cecil, recalls that what was then called a pavilion house was
meant to have "a quaint, farm-housey" feel, as well as
"crisp, contemporary detail to get an interesting mix of
period forces coming together."
   The Schenkers love the house so much they can't fathom why
no one else seems to: The place has been on the market for
two years.
   The couple, who raised two daughters in the home and now
want to move on to the next stage of their life, paid
$107,000 for the house in the '70s. But they put it on the
market in 1988 for $1.5 million, the price they feel it
"should" sell for. After much agent jawboning, the Schenkers
have cut the price four times, most recently to $895,000.
Only this summer did they finally get a nibble -- from a
real-estate firm that might be more interested in the acre
and a half of prime land than in the house.
   Like many home sellers these days, the Schenkers are
caught in a peculiar period in the real-estate market,
clinging to recent memories of surging prices while facing a
vengeful buyer's market.
   Real-estate agents in many parts of the country say one of
their biggest problems is that sellers still have their eyes
on the grand prices they saw a couple of years ago.
Unprepared for the reality of today's sluggishness, they're
digging in their heels on asking prices determined by
history, hearsay and hope.
   Some agents are getting tough on them. In June, syndicated
real-estate columnist Kenneth R. Harney surveyed three dozen
brokers, agents and lenders and found new tactics to combat
inflated hopes, including turning away sellers with
unreasonable expectations, refusing to extend some
longstanding listings, and placing time limits on prices.
   Real-estate markets are local, but Rye's sluggishness
afflicts plenty of other places too. Choice Chicago suburbs
like Winnetka, Wheaton and Highland Park face slow markets
for the first time in years, says Joel Zegart of the firm of
JBS &amp; Associates, who plans an auction this fall of
Chicago-area homes that he thinks are priced 25% or 30% too
high. In the Northeast, the median price of homes sold in
June was off 0.8% from a year earlier, says the National
Association of Realtors. June's median price was up 5.1% from
May's, though, as sales were concentrated in the high-end
houses. Volume was off.
   The median-price figures measure only homes actually sold;
they don't take account of the many for-sale houses that
languish on the market or get rented out because sellers
can't bear to lower prices any further.
   Mr. Schenker in Rye, for one, feels sure that the days of
double-digit appreciation will return. "Nowhere on my chest
does it say I have to be Santa Claus" to some lucky buyer in
the meantime, he says.
   The Schenkers concede they have benefited mightily over
the past 14 years, even with the current slump. In defense of
his asking price, Mr. Schenker notes that he and his wife
will also face appreciated prices when they finally sell this
home and start looking for another one.
   In the New York area, this pattern has contributed to a
house-and-garden gridlock stretching from this little city
scented by sea air and peonies southward 30 miles to
Manhattan's maze of unsold co-ops. "People can't buy until
they sell their own homes," says Mrs. Schenker, sipping
coffee in her beige-and-white living room in front of a
pottery collection featuring some of her own work. Her
husband finishes the thought without a pause: "It's a vicious
circle."
   But with many markets glutted with for-sale signs, home
buyers don't have to hurry. And in this coveted area, they
don't. Westchester County houses sold during the second
quarter had been on the market an average of 181 days. Sales
numbered 8.1% fewer than a year before. Breaking the logjam
may require price cuts greater than the 2% or 3% of late,
says the president of the county board of realtors, Henry W.
Fries: "Sellers still have not confronted the reality that
prices overshot the real market during the last few years of
the 1980s."
   Rye city manager Frank J. Culross figures that home sales
in his city are off about 30% from a year ago. And last year
wasn't great: 177 homes were sold in Rye. In 1986, the peak
year, 244 were.
   All this makes for the most popular parlor game around
these days: guessing how much one's home is worth. It's
particularly interesting in Rye, birthplace of Barbara Bush
and home to top-notch schools, a half-dozen country clubs,
several beaches and a tasteful art deco amusement park.
   Everyone's playing. Susan Morison, director of the Rye
Historical Society, who has no intention of selling her
stone-front colonial, says: "In my mind I think we'd get
$150,000 less than at the peak." But she adds: "I don't think
we'll ever lose money on it except in a depression."
   Meanwhile, property taxes are rising. City assessor Philip
McGovern is so incensed about county-imposed increases that
he's toying with the idea of retiring in nearby Connecticut.
   Robert Paris, an investment banker who lives in an
eight-room Tudor house near the Rye Golf Club, plays the
house-price game with bravado: He is asking $450,000 for the
house -- 17% more than records show he paid for it just two
years ago. Barbara Arnold finds this "amusing." She grew up
in what's now his house and says her mother bought it in 1944
for $5,000.
   National demographics are working against many of these
sellers. Fewer young adults mean fewer home buyers, while a
growing elderly population means more homes on the market.
"As baby boomers move into their 40s," says Edward Yardeni,
chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, "their asset
of choice is more likely to be a fixed-income security than
real estate."
   Historically, a "fair return" on a home was something
better than the inflation rate. But that was before "basic
shelter became part of the go-go financing of the '80s," says
Mr. Culross, the city manager. "I didn't understand why
property was appreciating 30%" in some recent years. "I
didn't object, but I didn't understand."
   The American tradition of "trading up" is shaky right now,
says Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill,
Boston. Newly fearful lenders mean "this isn't the kind of
economy where you decide you're going to buy that big house
across town," she notes.
   If the Schenker home had been sold in the Rye average of
181 days, the couple would have been out by January 1989 and
now well into the next stage of life as transplanted
empty-nesters. Instead, they've endured months and months of
last-minute showings. "It's like living in a fishbowl. It
puts a strain on everybody," says Mrs. Schenker.
   So it was with some reservations that the Schenkers asked
their real-estate firm, Country Properties of Rye-Harrison,
to advertise another open house. Public open houses, as
opposed to showings for screened clients, aren't high on
real-estate agents' wish lists, either.
   Brokers say home showings were much more genteel until the
arrival of big firms like Weichert Realtors, which bought out
a local agency about seven years ago. Weichert, based in
Morris Plains, N.J., has 200 offices in five states, and
favors open houses as a marketing tool. Other firms did the
same, whether they wanted to or not. Now, each weekend
brokers spread open house sandwich signs over Rye with some
distaste.
   On a recent Sunday, agent Rosalyn Feldman parked at the
foot of the Schenkers' long gravel driveway, lugged a Country
Properties open house sign out of her car and wrestled it
into the rocks. She was up against formidable odds: The sunny
day itself was competition. Serious lookers had already had
ample viewing opportunities.
   Then there was the house itself, which, as the brokers
say, isn't for everyone. The design includes an expensive
roof of terne, a tin and lead alloy. Perhaps as a reminder of
her former life, the widow who commissioned the house
insisted on a reproduction wood fireplace for the sleek
living room.
   Mrs. Feldman is only too well aware of the odds today as
she hustles along the hallways, snapping on lights and
yanking open shutters. Darce Davis, a veteran Country
Properties agent with a veteran smile, arrives to help keep
an eye on things.
   During the two-hour open house, there are eight visitors:
two foreign couples, a woman from the neighborhood in beach
togs, a man and a surly woman who says she missed the
broker-only open house (two years earlier), and Donald
Goveia, who is selling his own home across town and is
checking out the competition.
   Perhaps understandably, the walk-through provided by the
agents is a far cry from the loving tour provided by the
Schenkers, punctuated with little stories about the
fireplace, the specially designed door frames, pipe-dream
plans for the courtyard, and a seamless addition.
   Mrs. Davis, in contrast, speeds along a hallway lined with
built-in closets, ticking off "storage, storage, storage,"
then breezes into a bedroom, and so on.
   Her interest piques only at the entrance of Joan Mark, the
neighbor in beach togs, who seems like a serious prospect for
the future. Although Mrs. Mark finds the Schenker house "not
appealing" and is out the door in minutes, she is a broker's
dream: Someone who already lives in one of the best parts of
town and is seriously looking for another house.
   Mrs. Feldman has never shown the house before. One of the
husbands seems startled by the mention of electric heat.
Another exclaims no fewer than a half-dozen times about the
home's "very unique design" and wants to know the architect's
name. Mrs. Feldman squints at the tiny type on the flier in
an effort to be helpful and leads the couple outside for a
look at the grounds. Now the wife is startled by the size of
the property. "Too much land?" Mrs. Feldman asks, sensing the
woman's dismay. She gamely points out that all the property
doesn't have to be landscaped.
   Mr. Schenker notes the very same thing on a stroll with a
visitor, adding how much he enjoys the natural stand of trees
beyond the lawn and how there's enough room for a swimming
pool or a tennis court, with lawn left over. Mrs. Schenker
adds: "This year, there's a real boom in the pheasant and
brown bunny population."
   Do the Schenkers have a deadline in mind by which they
absolutely must sell the place? Mrs. Schenker levels one of
those is-this-person-crazy-or-what looks at her husband and
says: "It passed."
