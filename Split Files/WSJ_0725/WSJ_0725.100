   Four major media companies reported sizable drops in
second-quarter earnings.
   Net income fell 45% at Times Mirror Co. and 7.5% at
Washington Post Co. because of weak newspaper advertising.
Tribune Co.'s profit decreased 25% as its New York operations
continued to struggle, while Knight-Ridder Inc.'s earnings
dropped 65% after large one-time gains in the year-earlier
period.

   In Los Angeles, Times Mirror said the lower results
stemmed from depressed advertising revenue at its Northeast
newspapers and higher circulation costs at the Los Angeles
Times.
   Net fell to $47 million, or 36 cents a share, from $85
million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's
per-share earnings included a pretax gain of $23.1 million,
or 11 cents a share after tax, from sales of timberlands.
Revenue increased 5.3% to $906.6 million from $861.3 million.
   Operating profit from newspaper publishing fell to $51.7
million from $88.3 million a year earlier. Increased revenue
at the Los Angeles Times was offset by higher operating costs
resulting from a circulation increase, to a record 1.2
million daily and 1.5 million on Sundays.
   Led by increased sales at the company's legal publishing
and flight information businesses, Times Mirror's book,
magazine and other publishing segment showed an increase in
operating profit to $30.1 million from $24.6 million. Cable
television operating profit climbed to $17.4 million from
$16.1 million, while profit from broadcast television fell to
$10.6 million from $13.2 million.
   In the first half, net fell 40% to $93 million, or 72
cents a share, from $153.8 million, or $1.19 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 4.3% to $1.78 billion from $1.71
billion.
   Washington Post Co. said second-quarter net fell to $55.9
million, or $4.60 a share, from $60.5 million, or $4.72
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1% to $379.6 million from
$374.5 million.
   In the first half, earnings fell 7% to $95 million, or
$7.76 a share, from $102 million, or $7.94 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $720.5 million from $716.3 million.
   The company said results continue to reflect a weak
advertising climate. Revenue in the newspaper division fell
2% in the quarter and 1% in the half; advertising linage in
the flagship Washington Post fell 9% in the quarter and 8% in
the half.
   Revenue for Newsweek was up 6% in the quarter, with one
additional magazine issue published in the period. First-half
revenue was essentially flat, also with an additional issue
compared with last year's number.
   Broadcast division revenue fell 4% in the quarter and 6%
in the half. But cable division revenue rose 11% in both
periods. And revenue for its Stanley H. Kaplan Educational
Center and Legi-Slate businesses rose 13% in the quarter and
15.5% in the half.
   The per-share profit declines were smaller than the
overall dollar amounts, reflecting fewer shares outstanding.
   In Chicago, Tribune Co., still hampered by losses at its
New York Daily News operation and declining profits from its
newsprint-manufacturing interests, said second-quarter net
fell to $56.1 million, or 78 cents a share, from $75.3
million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier. The per-share
figures reflect a decrease in common shares to 66.4 million
from 73 million.
   Tribune said operating profit at its newspaper publishing
group fell 33% to $54.6 million from $81.7 million,
"primarily due to operating losses at the Daily News." The
company's big Chicago Tribune saw higher earnings, but its
"other daily newspapers were flat or down slightly" because
of soft retail and classified advertising. The company also
said the group's results were hurt by the write-down of a
minority investment in the Sunday Correspondent, a British
newspaper launched last fall. A spokeswoman declined to
provide the size of the write-down; the initial investment
was between $7 million and $10 million.
   Earnings at Tribune's broadcasting and entertainment
operation increased 22% to $49.4 million from $40.5 million.
The comparison with the year-earlier figures is skewed,
however, by a $10 million pretax charge taken by the company
to write down certain TV broadcast rights.
   Tribune's newsprint operation, being hurt by a softer
market and the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar, saw
operating profit plunge 83% to $3.1 million from $17.6
million.
   In Miami, Knight-Ridder said second-quarter net fell 65%
to $44.6 million from $126.8 million a year earlier -- a
period that included big one-time gains from the sale of a
newspaper and discontinued broadcast operations.
   The company said per-share profit fell to 88 cents from
$2.44, based on 50.8 million shares outstanding in the latest
quarter, compared with 51.9 million a year earlier. Revenue
rose 2% to $591.7 million from $578.7.
   Shorn of one-time gains in the 1989 second quarter, the
company said earnings from continuing operations rose 14%.
The year-ago per-share figures include a gain of 58 cents
from the sale of the Pasedena Star-News and a gain of $1.09
from the sale of discontinued TV operations.
   In the first half, net fell 52% to 70.4 million, or $1.37
a share, from $147.3 million, or $2.82 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $1.14 billion from $1.11 billion.
