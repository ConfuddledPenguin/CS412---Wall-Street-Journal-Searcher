   Minority women, suffering discrimination on two fronts,
are making little headway breaking into management ranks of
corporate America.
   While white women complain about the glass ceiling that
keeps them from the very top ranks, women of color are hardly
present in the management pipeline. Faced with both racism
and sexism, they're still struggling to land
middle-management jobs. And they've made few inroads in
entrepreneurial jobs, the refuge for those shunned in the
corporate world.

   Black women made up just 2% of managers in companies with
100 or more employees in 1988, compared with black men who
accounted for 3% of this group and white women who totaled
23%, according to the latest data available from the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. Not one black woman was
among the top 25 black managers in corporate America when
Black Enterprise Magazine ran an article naming them in 1988.
   Women of color -- who accounted for 10% of the work force
in 1988 -- complain they are bypassed for promotions and
relegated to staff positions that aren't on the fast track
and are vulnerable to corporate streamlining. Moreover, they
suffer from isolation, lack of mentors and stereotyping.
Personnel executives sometimes call them "twofers" because
they fulfill two equal opportunity employment obligations,
and that label undercuts their credibility on the job.
   Being a "twofer" helps some minority women get hired by a
company. But "being a twofer doesn't give you legitimization,
doesn't give you a voice or power and doesn't move you up,"
contends Ella Bell, a University of Massachusetts professor
who is studying more than 100 black and white women managers
in companies throughout the U.S. "You're a showpiece," she
says, and that "won't get you to be a general manager."
   Those who do land management jobs find themselves
constantly trying to prove that they can perform. "They feel
they have to be 20 steps ahead in terms of being the best,"
Ms. Bell says. "They feel they have to outperform, outshine
and outthink."
   Consider 40-year-old Charleyse Pratt, who recently left
Hyatt Legal Services to form her own consulting company in
Cleveland after working at a number of Fortune 500 companies.
"I've never been embraced in corporate America with open
arms," she says.
   At corporate meetings in previous positions, Mrs. Pratt
was often the only minority woman -- and the victim of sexual
as well as racial slurs. She says she learned early in her
career to develop a tough skin.
   As an assistant personnel director at a Midwest
electronics company, she gave seminars to senior executives
on sexual and racial harassment. One day, after a four-hour
presentation to 20 white male senior managers, one of the
men, whose last name was pronounced "coon," stood up and
said, "Do you mean the coons can't stick together?" All the
men, including her boss, broke into laughter.
   "I was speechless," recalls Mrs. Pratt. "It was the first
time I was ever referred to as that." She coolly ended her
presentation -- and later "cried all the way home." (She
reported the incident to a vice president, who temporarily
suspended the executive who made the remark.)
   More recently, at a Midwestern manufacturer, she was told
outright that she was hired to meet affirmative action goals.
And not long ago, she found herself teaching her job to a
white man who had been promoted over her. "He told me,
`You're going to have to learn to subordinate yourself to
me,'" says Mrs. Pratt.
   Companies may be forced to promote more minority women
into management in coming years, however, as the composition
of the work force changes drastically and more minority women
enter the labor market. By the year 2000, the number of black
women in the work force is expected to total 8.4 million, up
from 6.5 million in 1987, while the number of Hispanic women
is projected to increase to 5.8 million from 3.4 million,
according to Harbridge House, a Chicago consulting company.
   Some companies are already making efforts to promote
minority women into management. Companies making strides in
placing minority women in these jobs include Corning Inc.,
Xerox Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and
Digital Equipment Corp.
   "Right now there's a tremendous effort in corporate
America to look at multiculturalism," says Bea Young, vice
president of Harbridge House. Yet, many companies resist
promoting minority women to positions of authority, she says,
"because of the myth that no one will work for them."
   Marriam Gonzales, manager of ethnic marketing and
advertising for Kraft General Foods Inc. in Chicago, believes
race is a bigger barrier than sex is in business. She has
little difficulty, she says, establishing a rapport with
customers and clients on the telephone. The problem occurs
when they meet her in person. "They become standoffish," she
says.
   "I think some white people find it easier to deal with
light-skinned Hispanics than darker-skinned Hispanics like
me. I just wish we could be judged by our work and not our
skin color," she says.
   One of the success stories, Dorothy Turrell started at
Digital Equipment Corp. as a management development manager
in the Westminster, Mass., plant in 1976. Five years later,
after holding several staff positions, she was promoted to a
much more visible, senior job as plant manager at DEC's
Boston plant.
   "I wanted that job," says the 45-year-old Mrs. Turrell,
who says she has learned the importance of "being upfront"
about her ambitions. But some companies are also more
receptive to advancing women of color than others, she notes.
"I realize I could be at another company and not be where I
am now," she says.
   Getting promoted, however, is only a small part of the
battle. As a new plant manager -- and the only black female
to hold that job at DEC -- Mrs. Turrell had to work hard to
gain the loyalty of subordinates. Among other things, she
elicited workers' opinions and relied on team management
"instead of having all the answers myself." She still had to
contend with some employees who felt she should have an
advanced technical degree -- rather than her liberal arts
diploma -- along with "20 years experience."
   But for the most part, she won their support and respect
-- and another promotion. She's currently plant manager at
DEC's Cupertino, Calif., computer plant, overseeing 800
workers.
   As a black woman, she says, "it's inevitable that you're
going to be challenged and observed. In some cases, it's
going to feel like every time you walk through the door, you
have to be on." But she says she attained enough inner
confidence so "I don't have to be perfect all the time."
   While Ms. Turrell has advanced steadily through the ranks
of DEC, other minority women say the only way they've been
able to get ahead is by zigzagging from company to company.
Thirty-eight-year-old Jacquelyn Gates, a personnel executive,
started her career at J.C. Penney and has since worked at
such companies as PepsiCo, Paramount, Revlon and Time. She is
now manager of employment for New York's Nynex Mobile
Communications Co.
   She admits to being a "twofer" and says when she began her
career, she used that label to get her foot in the door. "I'm
certain I've received extra consideration because I was a
black female," she says.
   Once in the door, however, Mrs. Gates found herself with
only a handful of minority women peers -- and no mentors. The
dearth of top black managers -- let alone female black
managers -- makes it nearly impossible to find a savvy ally
who has both faced the same difficulties and blazed a trail.
   "White women have to worry about penetrating the male
network in corporate America. Black women have to worry about
that and the white network," says Mrs. Gates. As president of
the National Association of Negro Business and Professional
Women's Clubs Inc., based in Washington, she herself serves
as a mentor to younger minority women as they enter
management jobs.
   Will the twofer ideology ever end? Only slowly, says
Harbridge House's Ms. Young. "I still hear jokes about hiring
the black women to get two points," she says. "That's so
demeaning -- to hire someone because of her race and gender
and not her qualities."
