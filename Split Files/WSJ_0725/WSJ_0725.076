   NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. reported second-quarter earnings of
$397 million, or $3 a share, a 63% increase over the
year-earlier figure of $244 million, or $1.70 a share.
   Net income for the quarter included an after-tax gain of
$139 million, or $1.07 a share, on the June sale of 7% of
Alcatel N.V. to Compagnie Generale d'Electricite in Paris.
ITT retains a 30% stake in Alcatel N.V., a Paris-based
telecommunications firm.

   "The reason ITT outperformed most of its peers is its
international exposure. It generates 50% of its operating
profit outside of the United States," said Theresa Gusman, an
analyst at Salomon Bros. in New York.
   For the first six months, ITT earned $650 million, or
$4.88 a share, compared with $444 million, or $3.10 a share,
for the first half of 1989.
   Excluding the after-tax gain from Alcatel and a
first-quarter after-tax gain of $47 million from the sale of
2 million shares of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, ITT
earnings were $3.45 a share for the first six months.
   The company said operating results at the ITT Hartford
unit rose as a result of higher investment income and
improved life insurance operations, offsetting the continued
depression in North American casualty underwriting. Income at
ITT's defense segment declined during the quarter because of
reduced volume in some contracts and a strike at one unit.
