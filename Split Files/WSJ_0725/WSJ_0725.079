   ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Sundstrand Corp., as expected, offered
to acquire the 85% of Milton Roy Co. that it doesn't already
own, for $28 a share, or about $126.4 million.
   Earlier this month, Sundstrand disclosed that it had
accumulated about a 15% stake in Milton Roy, a St.
Petersburg, Fla.-based maker of instrumentation and control
equipment, and said it would seek to acquire the company.
Milton Roy has about 5.3 million common shares outstanding.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Sundstrand shares closed at $33.875, unchanged. Milton Roy's
shares rose $3.50, closing at $26.875.
   Last year, Milton Roy had sales of $125 million.
Sundstrand, which makes aerospace and industrial equipment,
had 1989 sales of $1.60 billion.
   In a letter to Milton Roy, Sundstrand said its all-cash
offer will remain open until the close of business on July
30, unless extended by mutual agreement.
   The proposal, which isn't contingent on financing, is
subject to the approval of Milton Roy's directors, and a due
diligence review of Milton Roy by Sundstrand as well as the
negotiation of a definitive merger agreement.
   Sundstrand's president and chief executive officer, Harry
C. Stonecipher, requested that Milton Roy's board avoid using
certain anti-takeover provisions and warned that failure to
do so would impair Milton Roy's ability to complete a
negotiated merger.
   Milton Roy said the proposal would be considered by its
board and "given proper evaluation in due course."
