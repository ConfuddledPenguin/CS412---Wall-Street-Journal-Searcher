   WASHINGTON -- Taxpayers shouldn't hold their breath
waiting for restitution from savings-and-loan crooks, nor for
fast sales of giant packages of assets from failed thrifts
taken over by the government, officials said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, testifying before the
Senate Judiciary Committee, said it is difficult to get funds
from individuals convicted of S&amp;L fraud and ordered to pay
restitution. Of $2.5 million in restitution ordered by courts
this year, Mr. Thornburgh said $50 had been coughed up so
far. Of $3.1 million ordered in 1989, $2,700 has been paid.
The department has fared better with the $5.8 million in
restitution that courts decreed in 1988: $21,000 has been
paid.

   Mr. Thornburgh noted ruefully that while he expects the
Justice Department to successfully prosecute hundreds of S&amp;L
executives, the department is unlikely to win back sums that
will make a dent in the cost of the taxpayer-financed
bailout, estimated at up to $500 billion with interest.
   Mr. Thornburgh also said he expects it will take five
years for the department to handle the bulk of the S&amp;L cases
and "perhaps begin winding down and transferring some
resources to other areas."
   Meanwhile, real estate seized from defunct
savings-and-loans probably won't be sold in the planned $500
million chunks before next year, the Resolution Trust Corp.
said.
   Prospective buyers will need a lot of time to examine the
big packages of real estate and loans, said Lamar Kelly, the
official in charge of asset sales for the S&amp;L cleanup agency.
The agency must hire investment advisers as well as firms to
prepare and evaluate the bids.
   The RTC will provide up to 85% financing for the packages,
which will include hard-to-sell loans and real estate. The
sales of three bulk packages, part of a pilot project, aren't
expected to close until the first quarter of 1991.
   The agency also is in the midst of selling $716 million of
loans in four packages. The sales don't require government
financing and are expected to be completed soon, the agency
said.
