   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms fell slightly in the week ended
Tuesday.
   The average yield on six-month small-denomination CDs sold
directly by banks slipped to 7.55% from 7.62%, according to a
nationwide, 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a New
York information service. The average for two-year consumer
CDs fell to 7.81% from 7.88%.
