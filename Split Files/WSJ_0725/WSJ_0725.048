   WASHINGTON -- A House panel urged the special prosecutor
in the Department of Housing and Urban Development scandal to
investigate whether former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, his
old law firm, and a onetime top aide violated federal bribery
and conspiracy laws.
   In calling for a much broader investigation by the special
prosecutor, Arlin Adams, the House subcommittee said that its
own 14-month inquiry had uncovered "widespread abuses,
influence peddling, blatant favoritism, monumental waste and
gross mismanagement" during Mr. Pierce's tenure.

   The lawmakers urged Mr. Adams to investigate whether Mr.
Pierce, who was the Reagan administration's only HUD
secretary, committed perjury before the panel on May 25,
1989, when he testified that he didn't order grants to be
awarded under a HUD program. In their 27-page letter, they
also asked him to investigate whether Mr. Pierce and other
HUD officials acted illegally in managing HUD's disastrous
co-insurance program for multifamily housing.
   In a statement yesterday afternoon, Mr. Adams said he
would review the panel's letter promptly and make a
recommendation to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who
could ask a special federal court here to give additional
authority to Mr. Adams. The court recently gave Mr. Adams the
authority to investigate developers, lobbyists and others who
sought or obtained grants from three HUD programs.
   Initially, Mr. Adams was appointed in March to investigate
whether Mr. Pierce and other HUD officials steered lucrative
rent subsidies to influential Republicans and friends under
HUD's so-called Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   Yesterday's letter was signed by Rep. Tom Lantos (D.,
Calif.), chairman of the Government Operations Employment and
Housing Subcommittee, and the seven other panel members. It
focused on Mr. Pierce's testimony before the panel last year
as well as his relationships with his former New York law
firm, Battle Fowler, and with his onetime executive assistant
at HUD, Lance Wilson.
   "It is obvious that Secretary Pierce did not give us the
full story," the panel said, and that some statements were
"inconsistent and at odds with the sworn testimony of other
witnesses."
   Questioned about his role in awarding subsidies under the
Moderate Rehabilitation Program, for instance, Mr. Pierce
testified, "I never told these people to fund anything." The
panel noted, however, that a former top Pierce aide, Shirley
Wiseman, testified that Mr. Pierce had directed her to fund a
project in North Carolina.
   In his original request for a special prosecutor, Mr.
Thornburgh, the attorney general, said that an investigation
of perjury wasn't warranted.
   The subcommittee charged that Messrs. Pierce and Wilson
were doing favors for each other after Mr. Wilson left HUD in
1984, and that Battle Fowler frequently sought Mr. Pierce's
assistance. It said that Mr. Pierce was planning to rejoin
Battle Fowler before the HUD scandal erupted.
   The panel said that Mr. Pierce manipulated a federal urban
development program to fund a Florida project in which Mr.
Wilson was a consultant. It said that Mr. Wilson worked to
steer HUD-related business to Battle Fowler.
   The lawmakers linked Mr. Wilson and Battle Fowler to a
controversial, 316-unit housing project in Amherst, N.Y. The
panel said that it appeared that the developers paid Mr.
Wilson $25,000 for obtaining a critical waiver of federal
regulations for the project. Last year, Dennis Penman, one of
the partners in the project, denied in an interview with The
Wall Street Journal that Mr. Wilson was involved in the
project.
   Mr. Wilson, who became a millionaire and Wall Street
investment banker, was a partner in many development projects
that received HUD rent subsidies.
   Battle Fowler and attorneys for Messrs. Pierce and Wilson
all denied any wrongdoing. Robert Plotkin, an attorney for
Mr. Pierce, said that the special prosecutor already had the
authority requested by the House panel, which he said was
seeking publicity.
