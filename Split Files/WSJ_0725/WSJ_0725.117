   WASHINGTON -- The head of the Senate Securities
subcommittee said he hopes a compromise can be reached on a
Bush administration-backed plan to shift some power from
commodity regulators to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) said that if discussions
on a compromise collapse, the legislation will become "a jump
ball on the {Senate} floor." The focus of the bill would move
regulation of stock-index futures from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to the SEC.

   Despite support from the securities industry, the proposal
appears to be headed for defeat. Backers of the bill are
looking to other areas to find a compromise. The primary
target, Sen. Dodd confirmed, is oversight of futures margins,
which currently are set by the commodities exchanges and
can't be overruled by a regulator except in emergencies.
Senate aides said any compromise would create a provision for
federal oversight of margins, or good-faith money that must
be put up in order to trade.
   At a Senate Banking Committee hearing, the heads of the
futures exchanges urged Congress to keep marginsetting
authority at the exchanges.
