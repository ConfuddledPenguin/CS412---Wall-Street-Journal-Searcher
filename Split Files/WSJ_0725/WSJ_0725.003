   WASHINGTON -- Growth in worker compensation slowed during
the latest quarter, the Labor Department reported, but still
was considered disturbingly high over the past year by many
analysts and economists.
   Wages, salaries and benefits paid to workers in private
industry rose 1.3% in the second quarter after a 1.6% gain in
the first quarter, the department said. But the
second-quarter rise still meant that the cost of compensating
workers grew 5.2% during the 12 months ended in June -- too
high, by many analysts' standards.

   Economists consider employment costs one of the best
indicators of inflationary pressures in the economy. Worker
compensation is a huge part of business costs, and its growth
can foreshadow increases in the prices companies charge for
goods and services.
   The compensation increases kept the average worker ahead
of consumer inflation, which was 4.7% in the year ended in
June.
   The department also reported yesterday that workers won
average annual wage increases of 3.8% in contracts settled so
far this year through collective bargaining. That's a big
improvement over the last time these workers negotiated,
generally in 1987 or 1988, when wage gains averaged 2.5%
annually over the life of the contract, according to the
department.
   As usual, the cost of providing benefits to workers
outstripped wage increases, the department said in its
employment-cost report. Wages and salaries grew 4.5% during
the year ended in June, while benefit costs jumped 6.9%.
   Part of the growth in wages reflected an increase in the
minimum wage this spring to $3.80 an hour from $3.35. But the
department said the effect of the increase, the first in 10
years, was probably minimal.
   Among industries, the wage gains over the past year varied
widely. They grew an average of 6.3% for health-service
workers but only 2.3% for transportation workers. Overall,
wages and salaries grew 4.6% in the service sector and 4.2%
in the manufacturing sector.
   In collective bargaining, service workers also made more
progress, winning average wage increases of 3.8% annually
over their new contracts' life, compared with an average of
3.3% for manufacturing workers.
