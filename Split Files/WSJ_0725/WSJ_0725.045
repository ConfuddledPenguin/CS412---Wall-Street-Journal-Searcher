   GLENMORE DISTILLERIES CO., Louisville, Ky., said it
borrowed $35 million through a private placement of senior
notes and has arranged a new $70 million revolving credit
agreement with banks. The 10.63% notes are due June 30, 2000.
They were placed with a group of insurance companies, and
proceeds were used to pay debt, the company said. First
Boston Corp. acted as Glenmore's agent. The revolving credit
replaces a $75 million facility with the same group of banks.
It is split into two portions -- $30 million for working
capital and $40 million for possible acquisitions. Citizens
Fidelity Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Louisville serves as agent bank.
Glenmore is a maker of alcoholic beverages.
