   WASHINGTON -- A House Appropriations subcommittee approved
a $12.8 billion natural-resources bill that would cut federal
timber sales in the Pacific Northwest in fiscal 1991 while
increasing funding for the Indian Health Service by nearly
27%.
   Total sales of timber from federal lands would be cut to
about 9.26 billion board feet nationally. Within the
Northwest, the new 3.2 billion board foot level is an
estimated 20% reduction from the current ceiling.

   Forest Service road funds would be cut to $151.6 million,
and though timber-industry allies blocked deeper reductions
sought by the subcommittee chairman, Democratic Rep. Sidney
Yates, the action reflects strong environmental pressure to
better protect forests and threatened wildlife.
   Mr. Yates had proposed cutting sales in the Northwest by
300 million more feet. But the new 3.2 billion-foot level is
more than 1.1 billion feet below the annual level of only two
years ago.
   The northern spotted owl, which the U.S. recently declared
"threatened" under the endangered species law, is the most
visible symbol of a pitched fight over the fate of the
forests, and the bill would provide an estimated $2.2 million
to protect the bird, including research and law enforcement
funds.
   The measure includes none of the $175 million sought by
the Bush administration for its "America the Beautiful"
tree-planting program. But elsewhere, the bill significantly
exceeds President Bush's budget in funding continuing
programs to protect natural resources.
   Funds for the management of Western range land and other
renewable resources under the Bureau of Land Management would
be increased by almost 25% from fiscal 1990 levels, for
example, and the bill is supportive of a White House
initiative to end timber sales entirely in eight so-called
below-cost forests where receipts don't match the cost of
running the program.
   Always a battleground for industry and environmental
interests, the underlying measure has drawn increased
interest in recent years for its role in providing public
funding for the arts. The National Endowment for the Arts
would receive an estimated $180 million, and more than $36
million is provided for the Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts here, including $15 million for what amounts to a
subsidy to help erase the center's deficit.
   Both decisions are sure to provoke controversy. The
endowment has become a favorite target for conservatives, who
have sought to attach restrictions to its federal grants. In
the case of the Kennedy Center, the bulk of the money would
still be in the form of a Park Service appropriation to
maintain the building and grounds. But critics argue that
including the $15 million to ease the current deficit sets a
precedent of having the government subsidize operating costs
that ought to be met by ticket sales and private donations.
   The eclectic nature of the bill makes for an extraordinary
array of alliances, and when lawmakers went behind closed
doors to resolve their differences, the agenda ran from
timber sales to arts to a ban on offshore oil exploration.
"Any national security involved?" asked Massachusetts Rep.
Silvio Conte, the ranking Republican on the full panel.
   "Just personal security," answered Illinois Rep. Yates.
   Political security is a factor, too, in construction
accounts laced with back-home projects. Park Service
construction funding would grow to $225 million, or more than
twice the president's request, and an estimated $153.4
million is provided for land acquisition and state grants, an
increase of more than 75% over the current fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30.
