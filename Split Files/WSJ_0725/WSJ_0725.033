   WASHINGTON -- The White House will use a last-minute
lobbying blitz to try to salvage its defense budget in the
House, where even senior Republicans appear ready to throw in
the towel.
   Faced with steadily eroding congressional support and a
drumbeat of complaints by GOP lawmakers that President Bush
hasn't personally entered the battle, White House aides have
scheduled a pair of White House sessions starting today to
plug the administration's defense priorities.

   Mr. Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft are
expected to urge bipartisan delegations of congressional
leaders to save the B-2 Stealth bomber, provide robust
funding for mobile nuclear missiles, and keep the Navy's most
advanced submarine programs alive, administration officials
said.
   Mr. Bush's staff, according to other administration
officials, also is considering a presidential speech next
week in Colorado taking on lawmakers intent on slashing such
big-ticket Pentagon programs, including research on
space-based antimissile defenses called the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   Such efforts, however, are likely to prove largely futile
in the House. Even before the House Armed Services Committee
begins voting next week on a $283 billion defense spending
bill for 1991, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, the panel's
ranking Republican, acknowledged that congressional support
has eroded badly for the administration's top-priority
defense requests.
   Rep. Dickinson, for example, said in an interview before
the White House decided on its new course, that he doesn't
intend to fight hard for money the Pentagon wants to deploy
MX missiles on specially built railroad cars. And he flatly
said he couldn't understand why the White House continues to
champion the radar-evading B-2, built by Northrop Corp., and
SDI.
   Even if Congress agrees to continue buying B-2s, the GOP
lawmaker asserted, "I don't know what their mission would
be." The Air Force's leadership "loses some credibility when
they're out there beating the bushes . . . for something that
just doesn't make sense," he added.
   Discussing the Navy's proposed fleet of high-speed,
super-quiet Seawolf attack submarines, which cost about $1.5
billion each, Rep. Dickinson said, "I don't know why we've
got to field a new class of submarines" in light of improved
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The Navy, which has one Seawolf under construction, wants
money for two more of the vessels in 1991. But the committee
is almost certain to pare the Navy's request by one, and it
may delay the construction schedule for the other. The Senate
version of the bill doesn't include any money for the
Seawolf, slated to be built by units of General Dynamics
Corp. and Tenneco Inc.
   The House panel also is expected to cut deeply into the
Navy's Trident nuclear-missiles submarine program as part of
the decision by its leadership to slash some $3 billion from
the administration's $19.1 billion sea power budget request
for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon's ambitious weapons-buying plans
are about to receive another blow from the General Accounting
Office. In testimony before the House Armed Services panel
today, Comptroller General Charles Bowsher is expected to
criticize Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sharply for failing
to go far enough to centralize procurement decisions and trim
acquisition and administrative personnel.
   To reduce the budget deficit and rein in the Pentagon's
procurement system, Mr. Bowsher will urge Congress to delay
full-bore production of the next generation of fighters,
helicopters and submarines until additional tests are
completed. And he is expected to call for reductions of 10%
to 20% in training, maintenance and other day-to-day
operating accounts, something the Pentagon strongly opposes.
Acting partly on Bowsher's recommendations, the committee is
ready to eliminate some 65,000 civilian employees from the
Defense Department's payroll by the fall of 1991, saving at
least $1 billion annually.
