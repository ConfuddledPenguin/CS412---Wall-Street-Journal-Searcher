   Dow Chemical Co. said second-quarter profit fell an
unexpectedly steep 50% from a year ago, sending the company's
stock into a skid.
   Although the second quarter is typically the strongest one
for the Midland, Mich., chemicals company, unit volume sales
were flat in comparison with the first quarter, and overall
prices fell from first-quarter levels as well as from a year
ago. In addition, manufacturing costs rose despite lower raw
material and energy costs.

   Net income dropped to $364 million, or $1.34 a share,
compared with $728 million, or $2.70 a share, a year ago. The
year-earlier per-share figure was restated to reflect a stock
split in November. Sales were $4.81 billion, up 4.5% from
$4.6 billion.
   Wall Street had expected Dow Chemical's profit to fall,
given a slump in the commodity chemicals business, but
analysts' per-share projections ranged from $1.75 to $2.13,
according to Zacks Investment Research Inc. After a delay in
trading because of an order imbalance, Dow Chemical closed in
composite New York Stock Exchange at a 52-week low of
$52.375, down $5.75 on about six times normal volume of 3.4
million shares.
   Enrique C. Falla, Dow Chemical's chief financial officer,
noted that the latest quarter compares with a strong quarter
a year ago, adding that the company still expects record
annual sales in 1990 and the third-highest annual profit. But
he said Dow Chemical expects seasonal slowdowns and continued
low prices to reduce profit in the year's second half below
that of the first.
   Some analysts said the weak results by an industry leader
like Dow Chemical signal prolonged troubles for others,
particularly companies with big interests in basic plastics
and industrial chemicals.
   Pretax operating profit in the plastics segment fell 40%
from a year ago to $279 million, largely reflecting a price
slump on product lines like polyethylene and polystyrene.
   In the chemicals and performance products segment, profit
plunged 63% to $177 million. Dow Chemical noted declining
demand for chlorinated solvents, used in dry-cleaning and
metal-cleaning products and in making chlorofluorocarbons,
refrigerants being phased out for environmental reasons.
   Manufacturing costs rose 3% from first-quarter levels as
maintenance shutdowns in Europe took longer than expected,
electric power outages knocked out two plants in North
America, and a strike idled a plant in Brazil.
   The declines in Dow Chemical's traditional businesses were
partially offset by gains from the consolidation of results
from Marion Merrell Dow Inc., a drug company 67%-owned by Dow
Chemical, and for Dow Elanco, a venture in agricultural
chemicals with Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Profit for the consumer
specialties segment including these units rose 48% to $268
million.
