   Alberta Government Telephones, Edmonton, said it agreed to
sell 50% of its Novatel Communications Ltd. unit, a maker of
cellular telephones, to Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. of West
Germany, an international manufacturing concern.
   Terms weren't disclosed, though the price was said to be
about 150 million Canadian dollars (US$129.8 million). An
Alberta Government Telephones spokesman wouldn't confirm this
estimate.

   Calgary, Alberta-based Novatel, which has about 1,200
employees in plants in Alberta, is expected to generate
revenue this year of about C$400 million, the spokesman said,
up from C$300 million last year.
   Alberta Government Telephones is owned by the province of
Alberta, which is preparing to take the big telephone utility
public later this summer. The spokesman said the partnership
with Bosch would expand Novatel's opportunities globally.
   The proposed sale is subject to various regulatory
approvals.
