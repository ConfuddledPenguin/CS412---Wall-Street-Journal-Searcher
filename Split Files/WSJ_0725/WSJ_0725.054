   For Small Business, Forecast Is Foggy -- but Not Frigid

   Grade the economic outlook for small business with a C --
as in cloudy and confusing.
   Economists specializing in small business are detecting
mixed signals. "One week the outlook looks good, the next it
doesn't," says William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist for the
National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business
trade group. Most economists continue to foresee no recession
soon -- but some economic sectors dominated by small business
are sluggish all the same.

   Donald Valley, for one, can attest to the confusion. Mr.
Valley, a Mazda auto dealer with showrooms in Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo, Calif., says his monthly sales chart
this year looks like a roller coaster. Mr. Valley says he
hasn't experienced anything like it before, in 10 years in
business. "There's no rhyme or reason for the ups and downs,"
he says.
   In the NFIB's latest monthly survey of more than 700 small
businesses, owners in June indicated they were less
optimistic about the future than a month before. They were
less confident about prospects for sales increases and less
likely to make capital outlays, hire new employees or invest
in inventories. Eight of the 10 components of its
small-business optimism index fell, the NFIB reported.
   What's more, Mr. Dunkelberg has turned cautious. He
doesn't foresee any trend strong enough to lift most sluggish
small businesses out of the doldrums this year. His scenario:
Consumer spending won't strengthen enough to give small
retailers a needed boost; auto sales won't recover
sufficiently to help profit-pinched dealers; and a rebound in
construction isn't likely soon to aid small contractors.
   Overall, "things are just slowing down," he says.
   Economists at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic-forecasting
concern, also foresee a weakening climate for small companies
this year. "It's not going to be a party," says Scott Aguais,
a DRI analyst who prepares a small-business climate index for
American Express Co.
   The index tracks demand for small-business goods and
services, financing and operating costs, and owners'
attitudes.
   In this year's first quarter, the index achieved its third
consecutive quarterly rise, marking a strong period for small
business. Unusually warm weather gave restaurants,
construction contractors and gas station owners a welcome
assist. But DRI expects the index to post a decline for the
second quarter amid falling demand for retail goods and
housing construction.
   Likewise, contractors see little letup in the construction
slump. Joseph Krusinski, owner of Podcor Construction Co., a
commercial and industrial builder in Westchester, Ill., says
long-term contracts should carry him through the end of this
year, but for next year, he can't rely on established
customers for repeat business and must scout for new ones.
   His competitors are doing the same. He recently approached
a prospect who plans to put up a 70,000-square-foot office
and warehouse building next spring. But he faces five rival
bidders for the job -- two to three more than would have been
attracted a year ago. "While contractors may be busy {now},
they see dark at the end of the tunnel," he says.
   For small retailers, intensifying competition means
slimmer profits this year. Steve Patterson, owner of a
family-operated menswear store in Bemidji, Minn., expects his
revenue will increase 5% to 10% this year. But his costs are
likely to be up even more. His top concern: health-care costs
for his 30 employees. They've jumped 15% to 20% annually for
five years.
   He is also dissatisfied with his revenue growth. Large
discounters are invading his marketplace. K mart Corp. just
expanded its local store. And both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
the Target unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. have expressed
interest in putting up stores.
   For the most part, Mr. Patterson says, discounters don't
offer the moderately priced menswear he does, except for
Levi's. But they'll be drawing from the same limited pot of
local dollars spent on retail purchases. "It's harder and
harder to be a small independent -- and that's not crying,"
he says. "That's just a fact."
   Auto dealers, too, see only tougher times ahead. The
welter of rebates and other incentives being offered by auto
makers to stimulate sales in a slumping new-car market does
little to benefit dealers, contends Mr. Valley, the Southern
California dealer. Customers now count on rebates for
starters, then insist on negotiating further. As a result,
while Mr. Valley used to rely on new-car sales for most of
his profit, he says he now breaks even, at best, on new cars.
In the meantime, he's working to turn his once-marginal parts
and service departments into profit centers.
   Still, he worries about profit this fall. Mr. Valley
expects auto makers will further confuse customers by larding
on even more incentives in an effort to move 1990 models as
next year's come in. And customers, he maintains, will
continue to spend "too much of their time looking at all the
incentives and not enough time at the car that fits their
needs."

   DISHEARTENING SIGN: Business failures rise for the first
time in four years.
   But the Belly-up Belt is largely limited to the Northeast.
At least, that's where failures were infrequent enough that
recent failures represent huge percentage rises.
   The number of failed firms, most of which are small,
increased 1.8% during the first four months of this year to
17,944, reports Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. The rise abruptly put
an end to a three-year drop in failures. "We knew the economy
was more under stress in 1990 than in other years," says
Douglas Handler, a D&amp;B economist, but the extent of the
recent rise still surprised him.
   In New England, where failures nearly tripled in the first
part of this year to 829, Massachusetts was the worst off by
far. Its failures nearly quadrupled to 593. Most involved
construction, wholesale, retail, or service companies.
   Other Northeast states -- Vermont, Rhode Island, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine and New York -- ranked among the
nation's 10 hardest hit.
   Still, the rest of the country went largely unscathed. In
the Pacific states, failures fell 20.1% to 2,950. They also
were off in the Mountain and North Central areas.
