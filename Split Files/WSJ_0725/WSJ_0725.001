   ATHENS, Greece -- When Procter &amp; Gamble Co. bought up the
property of a debt-burdened Greek engineering company earlier
this year, it received an unexpected dividend -- a bazooka
shell slamming into its Athens office.
   The late-night attack injured no one. But it could have
set back the Greek government's greatest economic hope: to
reorganize, sell or liquidate 30 unprofitable or
debt-burdened state-administered businesses. The concerns,
which account for 10% of the country's industrial revenues,
are sunk in debt totaling 170 billion drachmas ($1.07
billion). All but one is in private hands; all are under
government control.

   An organization called 17 November took responsibility for
the P&amp;G attack. The extremist group said it fired on the
company's local branch office because it "scandalously bought
up" the property of A&amp;G Couppas S.A. for "a mere" 454 million
drachmas.
   "We warn any Greek or foreigner who buys a company without
paying the debts, that we will consider it a robbery of the
Greek people," said 17 November, which has a history of
murdering U.S. diplomats and Greek industrialists.
   The incident has cast uncertainty over investing in
Greece. "Nobody is going to want to be a target, with
bodyguards and security and that kind of thing," said
economics writer Constantine Collmer.
   P&amp;G was the first foreign company to buy into what are
known here as "provlimatikes," or problematic businesses. So
far, it's the only one.
   But Greece's three-month-old free-market government
appears determined to continue its program to deal with the
companies. "We have no time to lose," Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis said recently, just before embarking
on a tour of Western capitals aimed at attracting potential
investors.
   Economics minister George Souflias, took the first step
June 27 when he announced that Kerafina S.A., a ceramics
company, would be listed on the Athens Stock Exchange and the
over-the-counter market. He also said Kavala Plastics S.A.
would be put up for auction.
   A Herculean task lies ahead. These problem companies have
cost Greek taxpayers about 510 billion drachmas over the past
seven years just to keep them going. They include well-known
industries such as Aget Herakles S.A., the country's biggest
cement maker and the only one of the concerns whose stock was
publicly listed, and textile concern Piraiki-Patraiki S.A.
   These companies employ 27,000 people. Their votes could be
crucial for the government, which has a razor-thin
parliamentary majority of one. A strong Socialist and
left-wing opposition already has started whipping up strikes
to protest the government's plans.
   "If {the government} manages it," said one diplomat, "it
will be the most exciting thing to happen in Greece for the
past 20 years." The state is expected to save as much as $1
billion a year if all goes well.
   The basic plan is straightforward. According to Mr.
Souflias, some of the ailing businesses will be publicly
listed, others will be sold outright, and the most hopeless
cases will be shut down. In the case of companies that are
closed, laid-off workers will continue to be paid for a year.
   "It's too great a political risk," said Theodore Karatzas,
former deputy economics minister who served in the eight-year
Socialist administration that was voted out last year. "I
don't know if this government will do what it says it will."
   Mr. Karatzas, who has been described as an apolitical
technocrat, disavows any ideological connection with the
Socialist Party, which the present government blames for
having poured billions of drachmas into the state-run problem
businesses, and, by extension, into the pockets of party
appointees who headed the companies. "The Socialist
government didn't start the problem anyway," he added.
   Who did? The answer: a conservative government in 1953. In
the interest of economic growth, it nationalized most of
Greece's banks and started a tradition of government
intervention that is one of the biggest difficulties of Greek
business life. Poor management added to the problem.
   The Socialist government of the 1980s started an orgy of
borrowing to finance its expanded state services -- and
handsomely reward its political favorites. Prime Minister
Mitsotakis has said Greece's public debt by the end of this
year will hit 15 trillion drachmas, with the public-sector
borrowing requirement at about 3.5 trillion drachmas,
one-third of the gross domestic product.
   The starting prices of the debt-ridden companies aren't
exactly bargains. Piraiki-Patraiki, which posted a 1989
operating loss of 14.9 billion drachmas, half the total 1989
losses of all the problem businesses, is now offered for sale
at exactly that sum. And the buyer must take over the
company's debt of 30 billion drachmas.
   "Who is going to buy at such crazy prices?" asked Mr.
Collmer, the economics writer. The companies also are
burdened with obsolete equipment which, in the words of an
editorial in the English-language business journal Greece's
Weekly, "is worth little more than scrap."
   Not all the ailing concerns are unprofitable; some simply
have too much debt. Thanks to the healthy world demand for
cement, for example, Aget Herakles reported a 1989 operating
profit of 3.5 billion drachmas.
   But as the 17 November group has demonstrated, the subject
is still touchy. "Investors are poking around here," said a
U.S. business consultant in Athens. "But security is on a lot
of minds right now."
   The ruling New Democracy Party also has its own cadres to
worry about. During a period of multiparty rule last summer,
New Democracy put its people in the problem companies' top
jobs, just as the Socialists had done. Now, the bosses don't
want to give up their fat salaries, free travel and
chauffeured limousines.
   Mr. Souflias has said he is looking into charges that some
of the companies increased their inventories or falsified
production records to give the impression that business is
booming.
