   KITIMAT, British Columbia -- Alcan Aluminium Ltd. and the
Canadian Association of Smelter and Allied Workers reached a
tentative three-year contract yesterday, hours after about
1,600 workers struck the company's smelter and related power
plant near here.
   Union members are scheduled to vote on the proposed pact
early today and could be back to work immediately, averting a
halt of output at the smelter. The plant, which at capacity
produces about 260,000 metric tons of aluminum annually, is
temporarily being operated by management personnel, an Alcan
spokesman said. Montreal-based Alcan has significant aluminum
operations in the Quebec province as well as in British
Columbia.

   The new pact would replace a two-year contract that
expired at midnight PDT Monday. The proposed accord provides
for annual wage increases of about 6% in each year of the
pact, plus other increases, including immediate signing bonus
payments, a union official said.
   The average hourly wage at the smelter under the previous
pact was $19.48 Canadian dollars (US$16.86), Alcan's
spokesman said.
