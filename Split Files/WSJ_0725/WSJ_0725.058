   WASHINGTON -- Policy makers at the Federal Reserve Board
are still dissatisfied with the U.S. inflation rate, Chairman
Alan Greenspan told Congress, but he said he is confident
that the Fed's policies will bring inflation down.
   Mr. Greenspan's testimony to a House subcommittee, like
remarks he made to the Senate Banking Committee last week,
suggested that further easing of credit by the central bank
isn't imminent. Earlier this month, the Fed allowed a key
interest rate to slip for the first time since December in an
effort to "offset" banks' increasing caution in lending.

   But yesterday, responding to questions on the overall
state of the economy, Mr. Greenspan said, "The inflation rate
is higher currently than we would like." He explained: "We
don't like to see it where it is because it's very easy to
accelerate from here."
   The past 12 months have seen a 4.7% increase in the
consumer price index, perhaps the most widely used measure of
inflation. That is about the same as in each of the past
three years, and it is an improvement from the rate earlier
this year, when a cold wave drove up food and energy costs
and caused a jump in the overall inflation rate.
   Last week, however, the Labor Department reported that
consumer prices rose 0.5% in June, their biggest increase
since March. Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee's
domestic monetary policy subcommittee yesterday that the
latest price report added "a note of caution" to the
inflation outlook. A continuation of inflation at that pace
"clearly would be very troubling," he said.
   Partly because of that report, renewed worries over
inflation have spread through the financial markets recently.
A number of investors cited those concerns as one factor
behind the stock market's fall Monday.
   In testifying before the Senate Banking Committee last
week, Mr. Greenspan referred only briefly to the consumer
price report, which came out that morning. He said the
figures were "higher than we'd like to see" but added that
"the core of inflation in consumer prices . . . has moderated
in recent months." His statements led some financial analysts
to suspect that the Fed was losing some resolve to fight
inflation. His comments yesterday appeared to be an attempt
to end such speculation.
   Responding to questions from subcommittee chairman Stephen
Neal (D., N.C.), who has introduced legislation that would
require the Fed to pursue policies to virtually eliminate
inflation, Mr. Greenspan insisted that the Fed remains
committed to bringing about full "price stability."
   At the same time, he told the committee that the most
recent inflation figures are in many respects "history," and
he called the current inflation rate "a lagging phenomenon."
   Mr. Greenspan's remarks come at a time when the economy
is, by his own words, "very sluggish." Nevertheless he
expressed no grave concern that the nation is in danger of
falling into a recession.
   In fact, he said he is "feeling somewhat more comfortable
about the underlying base of the economy," noting that some
of the excesses spawned in the 1980s, such as massive
leveraging, have abated.
   "We've come a long way without tilting into a recession
and I think in doing so we have ameliorated some of the
imbalances engendered during the mid-1980s," he said.
