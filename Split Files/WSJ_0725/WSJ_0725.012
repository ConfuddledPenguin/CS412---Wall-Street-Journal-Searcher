   NEW YORK -- Short interest among smaller over-the-counter
stocks leaped 18.5% during the month ended July 13, while
short interest among larger OTC stocks rose 1.2%.
   The jump in short interest among smaller stocks follows a
21.2% increase in the mid-June month, which largely made up a
25.9% drop in May.

   Sentex Sensing Technology, a Ridgefield, N.J., developer
of air-detection devices, led the issues with the largest
increase in short interest. On June 6, the company introduced
Scentoscreen, an air analyzer designed to help states and
industrial companies comply with the proposed Clean Air bill.
Short interest in Sentex Sensing surged by nearly three
million shares, to 3.7 million.
   Short interest in the American depositary receipts of
Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's state-controlled telephone
company, jumped 137.7% to 3.9 million shares.
   Short interest in Immucell jumped 64.4% to 3.1 million
shares. Yesterday, the Portland, Maine, biotechnology company
announced that shareholders approved a 1-for-100 reverse
split of its common stock. Immucell President Thomas Adelman
also said the company expects to report improved results next
month for the second quarter. The company had a loss of
$285,700 in the first quarter and a loss of $430,280 in the
year-earlier second quarter.
   Among those stocks in which short positions shrank the
most, the short interest in AST Research, a maker of personal
computer systems, fell 85.8%, and the short interest in
United Healthcare, a health maintenance organization, dropped
90.3%.
   First Executive, the Los Angeles life insurance company
that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds, maintained
its rank as the stock with the largest short position: 8.3
million shares sold short, despite a drop of one million
shares from mid-June.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, of Nasdaq stocks that
trade on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.
   The NASD reported that short interest in 2,306 National
Market System issues, the largest OTC stocks, totaled 256.1
million shares at mid-July, up from 253 million in mid-June
among 2,333 shares.
   Short interest in 1,252 smaller securities traded on
Nasdaq jumped to 42.7 million shares in mid-July from 36
million in mid-June among 1,245 issues.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-July rose to 2.57 from 2.15 a month earlier, while the
short-interest ratio for other OTC issues climbed to 1.06
from 0.80 a month earlier.
   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.
   The adjacent tables show the National Market System issues
in which a short position of at least 50,000 shares existed
at July 13 or in which the short position had changed by at
least 25,000 shares from mid-June (see accompanying tables --
WSJ July 25, 1990).
