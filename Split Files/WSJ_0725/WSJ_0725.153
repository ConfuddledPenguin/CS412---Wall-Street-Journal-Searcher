   DETROIT -- The minirally in the U.S. car market fizzled in
mid-July, as sales of domestic cars and light trucks plunged
13% from year-before levels.
   The Big Three U.S. auto makers all suffered double-digit
sales declines. Chrysler Corp. had the worst overall
performance, as its total sales of cars and trucks dropped
19%. But Ford Motor Co. did little better as its total
vehicle sales fell 18.5%, largely because of a 24.6% plunge
in sales of its domestic cars.

   Meanwhile, most major Japanese auto makers continued to
boost sales of their North American-built models. The
exception was Nissan Motor Corp., which saw combined sales of
its U.S.-made cars and trucks slip 1% in the period.
   Overall, sales of domestic cars fell 13.3% to 191,779
vehicles. That amounts to a seasonally adjusted annual
selling pace of 6.9 million cars, down from a strong 7.7
million-car pace a year earlier. The latest results put a
damper on a market that had seen two consecutive strong
periods. Early July sales hit a healthy 7.3 million annual
rate, while late June sales surged to an eight-million-car
selling rate.
   Dealers and company officials speculated that consumers
may be balking because of confusion about recent pricing
moves by the Big Three. General Motors Corp., Ford and
Chrysler all recently announced midyear price increases, and
this week began signaling even stiffer price increases for
the fall.
   "We have people come in and say, `There's a $2,000 rebate,
but they raised the price 3%. What's the real price?'" said
Longview, Wash., dealer Jim Clary, who has Chevrolet,
Jeep-Eagle and Chrysler franchises.
   Ford's weak performance in the passenger-car market was
largely the result of poor sales of two bread-and-butter
models. Sales of the subcompact Ford Escort tumbled 34% from
the year before, while sales of the midsized Ford Taurus
plummeted 35%. A Ford spokesman said the company saw a sharp
reduction in sales to high-volume fleet customers during the
period because its U.S. plants were closed for their
traditional two-week summer vacation.
   But Ford continued to surge in the off-road vehicle
business. Ford's new Explorer and its predecessor, the Bronco
II, together outsold Chrysler's rival Jeep brand by 10,977
vehicles to 10,152 vehicles during the first 20 days of July.
Jeep sales fell 31% during the July 1-20 period.
   At GM, total car sales fell 12.5% in mid-July, while
light-truck sales dropped 13.7%. Chrysler, meanwhile,
suffered a 19.1% drop in car sales and an 18.9% decline in
sales of its Jeeps, minivans and other trucks.
   Among Japanese auto makers, Honda Motor Co. boosted sales
of its domestically produced Accords and Civics 3.2%. Toyota
Motor Corp. increased sales of its domestically made Corollas
and Camrys 62.6%, in part because of increased production.
   Mazda Motor Corp. posted a 70.6% gain in sales of its
Michigan-built models, and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. improved
sales of the sporty models it builds at its joint-venture
plant with Chrysler in Normal, Ill.
