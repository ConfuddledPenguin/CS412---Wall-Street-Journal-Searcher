   TORONTO -- Abitibi-Price Inc., a forest products concern
78.9%-owned by Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., said it is
shutting temporarily three of its printing-paper mills, two
in Quebec and one in Ontario, for eight to nine days each
this month and next month, to scale down inventories. The
company said idling the mills will remove 10,000 tons of
uncoated groundwood grades and 4,000 tons of coated papers
from the market.
