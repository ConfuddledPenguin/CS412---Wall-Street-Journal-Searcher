   One of the fringe benefits of living in California is
having the chance to hear the high-flown rhetoric and
excessive claims of Assembly Speaker Willie J. Brown Jr.,
arguably the most powerful political leader in the state
beside the governor.
   In the current efforts of the legislature to oversee and
enforce "comprehensive equity goals in higher education," Mr.
Brown has already mounted the charge: "Freedom may have
embraced Eastern Europe, but California's college and
university systems are still held hostage," he recently
proclaimed. "They are prisoners of racism, and their hostile,
wholly intolerant environment is contributing to a higher
dropout rate among people of color."

   To do something about what the speaker calls "this
thriving injustice," Assemblyman Tom Hayden has introduced
legislation that would require all publicly supported
colleges and universities to have by the year 2000 a student
body that is proportionately representative "of the ethnic
composition of recent high school graduates, both in first
year classes and subsequent graduating classes."
   The bill also provides for the continued use of "special
admissions standards" to increase the enrollment proportions
of under-represented minority students whose grades and test
scores are too low to qualify for admission through "regular"
admissions categories.
   In one form or another the Hayden bill is likely to win
legislative approval. And even if it is successfully vetoed
by the governor, there is strong evidence that the 19-campus
California State system and nine-campus University of
California system are prepared to carry out these mandates
with or without legislative action. In its determination to
overcome ethnic underrepresentation, for example, UC Berkeley
is committed to a plan that "enrolls new undergraduates from
all ethnic groups in proportion to their representation among
high school graduates."
   Berkeley law professor Stephen Barnett has noted one
potential consequence of this policy: "If `all' ethnic
groups, including whites, are entitled to proportional
representation, then no ethnic groups -- including Asians --
may be overrepresented. A policy of guaranteeing parity for
every ethnic group amounts to imposing a ceiling, or quota,
on every other ethnic group."
   This is not merely a theoretical observation. Over the
past six years, about 60% of California's high school
graduates -- and 70% of those academically eligible for
admission to the University of California system -- have been
white. Over those same six years, white freshmen enrollments
at Berkeley have dropped to 32% from 58%. Black and Hispanic
high school students, who make up 2.5% and 7%, respectively,
of those academically eligible for admission to the UC
system, are 12% and 23% of those admitted. Asians constitute
20% of high school graduates who are academically eligible
for UC and 23% of the freshman class.
   But Berkeley's white and Asian applicants are not likely
to benefit from racial parity anytime soon. Berkeley
officials regularly assert that its race-specific admissions
policy of granting preference to underrepresented minority
applicants has not "come at the expense of quality." But many
faculty members contend that too many students have been
admitted who are insufficiently qualified to do Berkeley
work. They are concerned that more than 90% of the Asian and
white undergraduates at Berkeley have SAT scores higher than
those of about 90% of the blacks and Hispanics. What is
called the "great accomplishment" of slightly increasing the
mean SAT score of this year's entering freshmen, while
continuing to diversify the student body, ignores the SAT
disparity between Asians/whites and blacks/Hispanics that has
become greater in the past decade.
   "The administration has simply traded off larger gains
among Asians and whites -- larger because one is selecting
them from further out along the curve -- for smaller ones
among blacks and Hispanics," notes Berkeley anthropology
Prof. Vincent Sarich. And, he adds, it is simple statistics
that "as you get more and more selective among Asians and
whites, the competitive gap necessarily increases." When 94%
of Asians and whites have gotten better test scores than the
average black freshmen, is it any wonder that black
graduation rates are only about half that of whites?
   One of the most disturbing developments in the current
equalitarian assault on the university occurred in April at
Baruch College, the nation's largest business school, and one
of the institutions of the City University of New York. The
Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools deferred
renewing the school's accreditation for several months
because the minority representation on Baruch's faculty was
deemed inadequate and its rate of graduating minority
students too low. The reaccreditation went through only late
last month, after the college submitted an "action plan."
   The implicit assumption that white faculty members cannot
teach minority college students as well as minority
professors can is unfounded. (Nobody makes the reverse
argument.) Nor do white or black students perform better
academically if they are taught by persons of the same race
or color. We are told that minority students need role
models. Perhaps so. But they won't reduce the dropout rates
of blacks and Hispanics.
   However, the criticism that too few minority students are
graduating from Baruch College is new and alarming. One
wonders how many other institutions will be threatened by
Middle States because they do not have the "right" racial
proportions among their graduates. Are other accrediting
organizations now devising their own racial graduation quotas
that colleges and universities across the country will be
required to meet?
   A more serious concern is that accrediting agencies will
no longer put pressure, as they have in the past, on
institutions if they are too lax in their academic
requirements. It now appears that institutions will be
threatened with disapproval if their requirements are too
rigorous, a course of action that would undermine
long-established standards when they produce unacceptable
graduation rates for minorities.
   Educators and legislators need to confront some difficult
problems they have too often sidestepped. They could begin by
dropping the faulty notion that mere numbers are the true
measure of equity. If they did, they would then discover that
even if affirmative action were a science, as Asian Week
columnist Arthur Hu has observed, "the law of equal
proportions reflects racial equality about as well as the
flat world theory explains geography." Then, perhaps, they
would understand why there cannot be both equal proportions
and equal standards.
