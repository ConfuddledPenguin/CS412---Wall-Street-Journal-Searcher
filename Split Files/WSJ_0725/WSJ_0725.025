   Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. registered big increases in
second-quarter net income, while Texaco Inc. reported a small
decline and Phillips Petroleum Co. posted a large drop.
   Refining and marketing results for all four companies were
strong, with Chevron posting a record, as gasoline prices
held steady while crude oil prices plunged. That drop in
crude prices reduced profits on the exploration and
production side of the business, while chemical earnings
remained well below year-earlier levels.

   Mobil, based in New York, said net income rose 24% to $498
million, or $1.19 a share, from $401 million, or 98 cents a
share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a $182
million gain from the sale of an interest in a North Sea
oilfield and a $112 million charge for future environmental
cleanup costs, mostly at service stations. The year-earlier
figure included a $140 million loss on the sale of business
operations in South Africa and a $21 million gain from the
sale of a chemical company. Excluding the gains and charges,
Mobil's profit fell 18%. Revenue declined slightly to $13.8
billion from $14 billion.
   The company said oil prices averaged $2.22 a barrel below
last year's level in the quarter, resulting in a small
decline in exploration and production earnings. Refining and
marketing profits surged more than threefold to $278 million,
while chemical profits sank 49%. Petrochemical prices have
fallen sharply from last year.
   Chevron, based in San Francisco, said net rose 60% to $648
million, or $1.83 a share, from $404 million, or $1.18 a
share. The latest quarter includes $58 million of gains,
while last year's period included a loss of $11 million.
Revenue rose 8.5% to $8.9 billion from $8.2 billion mainly
because of higher sales volumes of crude.
   The company's refining and marketing profits surged more
than threefold to $370 million. Chevron said stable gasoline
prices were supported by tight supplies resulting from a
large number of refinery shutdowns. It also said refineries
yielded less gasoline per barrel of crude because of
environmental reformulations.
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said net dropped 3.6%
to $353 million, or $1.26 a share, from $366 million, or
$1.39 a share. Revenue increased 3.2% to $8.72 billion from
$8.45 billion.
   The company said its domestic gasoline sales grew 7.9%
amid flat demand industrywide, boosting overall refining and
marketing profits 57% to $328 million from $209 million. But
U.S. exploration and production earnings fell sharply because
of the lower crude prices, to $66 million from $168 million.
Petrochemical results also fell sharply, as they did at the
other integrated oil companies.
   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., said net plunged
47% to $105 million, or 43 cents a share, from $197 million,
or 81 cents a share. The year-earlier figure included a $21
million gain from the settlement of a pipeline dispute.
Revenue declined 9.7% to $2.98 billion from $3.3 billion.
   Stronger refining and marketing results weren't enough to
offset lower crude prices and the weakness in chemicals.
Phillips said its latest quarter included $58 million of
business-interruption insurance related to lost earnings from
its decimated Pasadena, Texas, chemical plant that exploded
last year.
