   ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL Inc., Menlo Park, Calif.,
instituted an anti-takeover "poison pill," declaring a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share
of common stock. The dividend will be payable Aug. 8 to stock
of record on that date. The rights will expire Aug. 8, 2000.
The terms of the rights are activated only if 30% or more of
the company's stock is acquired by a person or group. In the
event of a sale or merger, the holder is entitled to purchase
stock in the acquiring company at half the market price.
Robert Half International specializes in the placement of
tax, banking and financial personnel services.
