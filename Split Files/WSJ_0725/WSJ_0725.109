   Allied-Signal Inc. said second-quarter earnings fell 27%,
primarily because of losses in its Brazilian automotive
operations and a one-time gain a year earlier.
   The Morristown, N.J., advanced technology company, with
aerospace, automotive-product and engineered-material
businesses, reported earnings fell to $121 million, or 88
cents a share, from $166 million, or $1.11 a share, a year
earlier. The year-earlier results included a gain of $23
million, or 16 cents a share, from an insurance settlement
for Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, of which Allied-Signal
owns 40%. Sales were about flat at $3.2 billion.

   The company said automotive operations were "hit hard" by
a two-month production interruption in Brazil, caused by the
government's anti-inflation measures. It also cited continued
weakness in the U.S. car and truck market for after-market
products.
   In the first half, net fell 14% to $250 million, or $1.78
a share, from $292 million, or $1.96 a share. Sales rose to
$6.2 billion from $6.1 billion.
