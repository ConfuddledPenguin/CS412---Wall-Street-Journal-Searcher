   HONOLULU -- Bancorp Hawaii Inc. said it completed the
acquisition of FirstFed America Inc., parent of a 26-branch
thrift association, for $140 million.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Reserve
Board this month approved the sale, in which FirstFed
shareholders will receive $38.50 a share. Bancorp Hawaii,
with $9.8 billion in assets after the acquisition, required
that FirstFed's board and three bank officers resign as part
of the deal.
