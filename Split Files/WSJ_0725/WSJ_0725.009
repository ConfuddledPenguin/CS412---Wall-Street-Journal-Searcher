   CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc. began dismantling its
operations after an investor group's conditional offer to buy
a stake in the futures brokerage holding company collapsed.
   Stotler was among the largest independent futures clearing
firms in Chicago.

   The firm's inability to secure an infusion of money marked
the failure of a frantic attempt by its executives to shore
up Stotler's troubled finances. It is a major embarrassment
for Stotler Chairman Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, who also is
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade and who owns nearly
10% of Stotler's stock.
   "It's really kind of sad," said a CBOT member who asked to
remain anonymous.
   Mr. Mahlmann was testifying before the U.S. Senate in his
role as an exchange official and didn't return phone calls.
   Stotler's executives wouldn't explain what caused the
company's problems. In a brief announcement, the company said
it would give up its clearing memberships on the major
commodities exchanges, which cripples its ability to attract
business from institutional investors.
   Industry officials said the firm's troubles began when
regulators questioned the way certain financial data were
recorded by Stotler Group and its principal subsidiary,
Stotler &amp; Co. As a result of that, the Board of Trade
determined that the company's capital levels were below
industry minimums.
   Stotler's problems worsened as some of its major customers
began fleeing to other futures firms. In addition, Stotler
was forced to surrender some of its best accounts to
competitors. That move was designed to reduce the amount of
capital Stotler was obligated to hold to comply with
commodities exchanges' minimum requirements.
   Exchange members said Stotler is also being weakened by an
exodus of some of its brokers to competing firms.
   The conditional offer for part of Stotler, widely rumored
to have originated in Taiwan and amounted to more than $10
million, collapsed when the investor group's board of
directors failed to approve the purchase by Monday morning.
Yesterday's announcement of the failed deal pummeled
Stotler's stock, which fell $4 to close at $2.50 a share in
trading on the American Stock Exchange.
   Exchange members said that Stotler also is dismissing
employees. Other employees, they said, have begun seeking
work elsewhere, both on their own and with the firm's help.
"The message seems to be find another spot fairly quickly,"
one exchange member said.
   In its statement, Stotler said it had made arrangements to
clear its trades through an omnibus clearing account with
another futures firm, Brody, White &amp; Co.
   Until a few months ago, Brody White was known as Mocatta
Futures Corp. Brody White President Stephen Bergen said his
firm was simply acting to clear Stotler's trades and hadn't
acquired any part of the company.
