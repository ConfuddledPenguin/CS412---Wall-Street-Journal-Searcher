   Pepsi-Cola Co. is selling its Washington, D.C., bottling
franchise to a partnership headed by basketball star Earvin
"Magic" Johnson and Black Enterprise magazine publisher Earl
Graves, individuals familiar with the transaction said.
   Mr. Johnson, of the Los Angeles Lakers, had told Pepsi of
his interest in owning such an operation when he signed a
multi-year endorsement contract with the soft drink firm last
year, according to industry executives. In recent years,
Pepsi has generally been acquiring bottling franchises from
independent owners, rather than selling them. Pepsi-Cola is a
unit of PepsiCo, Purchase, N.Y.

   The Washington franchise sells about four million cases a
year, according to Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter.
Individuals close to Pepsi said the Johnson/Graves
partnership is not acquiring a stake in the plant that
services their franchise area.
   "For Pepsi it isn't so much good will with minorities,"
said Paine Webber Inc. analyst Emanuel Goldman of Pepsi's
motivation for the deal. "It's having Magic Johnson, who
appeals to a wide segment of the population."
   Although Pepsi officials declined to comment, they are
expected to announce details of the transaction at a
Washington news conference today. Mr. Johnson's business
representatives could not be reached for comment.
