   LONDON -- Mention a reunified Germany, and a company that
springs to mind as a likely beneficiary is Deutsche Bank. As
West Germany's largest bank, it already is aggressively
forging ties with East Germany that are expected to lead to
profitable business for years.
   "Deutsche Bank is a proxy for the West German stock
market," says Rod Barrett, analyst at Goldman Sachs
International, adding: "If you want to be in Germany, you buy
Deutsche Bank. If you want to get out, you sell it first."

   The bank's stock recently spurted 10% in a month, as
German currency reunification got off to a smooth start. But
the shares have subsided in recent days, falling 6.50 marks
($4.01) yesterday in Frankfurt to 814.50 marks ($502.62).
   Some analysts say that now isn't the best time to buy
Deutsche Bank stock. They advise investors to wait for a
correction in the recently revived West German market --
which, they say, may come soon -- and use the opportunity to
buy Deutsche Bank on temporary weakness.
   Yesterday, the bank's American Depositary Receipts were
quoted in the U.S. over-the-counter market at $503 bid.
   "Currency reunion didn't turn out to be as inflationary as
many people believed," says Heino Ruland at Julius Baer
(Deutschland) in Frankfurt. "That led to a bond market rally,
which led to a stock market rally. But I'm expecting a
{negative} reaction in the stock market, and that's the time
to pick up Deutsche Bank shares -- on the dip. Medium to long
term, it's quite an attractive investment."
   Why should the market drop? The costs to West Germany of
reunification haven't disappeared. "If anything, capital to
East Germany will need to be increased," Mr. Baer says,
perhaps boosting West German interest rates.
   Robert Grant at Nomura Research Institute in London says
that if interest rates rise, "bank stocks will come under
pressure," presenting an opportunity to pick up Deutsche Bank
shares. "I can't see the stock really going far below 800,"
he says.
   The bank will post first-half earnings next week. Analysts
expect a healthy 15% to 25% rise from the year earlier's
operating profit of 1.87 billion marks. In line with German
custom, the reported figure won't reflect the bank's own
substantial trading for its own account.
   "It should be a very good performance," says Thomas
Albrecht, German bank analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a unit
of Union Bank of Switzerland. "Interest margins are under
less pressure; an increase in long-term rates recently has
enabled banks to charge customers higher rates. The bank's
commission business {in West Germany, banks are the major
securities brokers} could be revived again, with the stock
market in overdrive and volume coming back."
   Deutsche Bank's East German ventures officially began this
month. The bank says it expects to open 100,000 East German
retail accounts by next Tuesday. It will soon take control of
Deutsche Kreditbank, the commercial-bank offshoot of East
Germany's central bank. The operation -- already 49%-owned by
Deutsche Bank -- has 120 branches, to go with about 30 more
that Deutsche Bank is planning.
   Analysts seem more curious than concerned about the cost
of East German expansion. "The question for Deutsche Bank is
how fast these operations are put to optimum size," says Mr.
Albrecht. Both Julius Baer's Mr. Ruland and Susan Sternglass,
who tracks the bank for Goldman Sachs, predict that in East
Germany the bank can exceed the 5% retail market share it has
in West Germany.
   "The long-term potential by being there from scratch is
huge," says Mr. Ruland, adding: "It also enables Deutsche
Bank to establish ties with the former Russian satellites and
Russia itself."
   Analysts expect Deutsche Bank to capitalize many of its
East German costs, but Mr. Ruland estimates that in the
second half such costs will penalize earnings by at least 100
million marks. A bank official indicates that labor and
equipment costs attributable to East Germany will total at
least 300 million marks on an annual basis in the first year.
And Deutsche Bank announced this week that it will provide
700 million marks to increase its stake in Deutsche
Kreditbank -- where it already has a 150 million mark
investment -- to 84.7% from 49%.
   Mr. Albrecht, for one, calls the stock a bargain now. "I
doubt whether interest rates will go more than plus or minus
half a point {from just under 9% currently}," he says. "The
stock now is at its average value of the past 10 years. It
has the potential of beating its all-time high of 910 marks
in 1986."
   Others are less upbeat. Deutsche Bank "on a short-term
basis is slightly overvalued," says Goldman's Ms. Sternglass.
Because German bank portfolios are heavily loaded with stocks
of domestic corporations, Goldman's analysis strips away from
a bank's market capitalization 50% of the value of the bank's
portfolio. The 50% deduction is meant to reflect
capital-gains taxes if the portfolio were sold. On this
basis, Deutsche Bank currently would be valued at about 715
marks a share, Ms. Sternglass says.
