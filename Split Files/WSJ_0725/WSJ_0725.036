   WASHINGTON -- If the Teamsters union strikes against
United Parcel Service of America Inc. at the end of the
month, the U.S. Postal Service has a message for large
shippers: Take a number.
   Under the Postal Service's plan, anyone with five or more
packages to be delivered by truck or priority mail will have
to call a toll-free number, make a reservation and then take
the parcels to a designated postal facility for delivery. The
agency doesn't plan any restrictions on its overnight
express-mail service or on shipments of fewer than five
parcels.

   The Teamsters' contract with UPS expires July 31, and the
union has advised its members against accepting the company's
final wage and benefit offer. A vote on the contract offer is
to be tabulated by July 31, and UPS has told its customers
that it can't guarantee its service will continue
uninterrupted after that.
   "There's no way the United States Postal Service can
absorb the operations of UPS overnight," deputy Postmaster
General Michael Coughlin said at a briefing yesterday. He
said the agency's first responsibility is the 500 million
pieces of mail it now handles daily. "But we are a national
postal service and we'll try to serve," Mr. Coughlin added.
   Postal officials said UPS delivers about 10 million
parcels by ground transportation daily, or 20 times the
Postal Service's volume for that category. UPS also delivers
300,000 packages overnight, compared with 200,000 delivered
by the Postal Service. The agency handles 1.5 million parcels
mailed at the first-class rate daily (called priority mail),
compared with half a million in that category handled by UPS.
Officials said priority-mail package delivery could be slowed
by about a day if there's a surge in demand because of a
strike against UPS.
   Under its labor contract, the Postal Service can hire
temporary workers numbering up to 5% of its total work force
of about 700,000. Officials said that number of temporaries
probably wouldn't be enough if there's a nationwide UPS
strike. The agency might have to declare an emergency, which
would permit them to hire additional help.
   The Postal Service doesn't view the possibility of a
strike against a major competitor as a chance to impress the
public or pick up new business. "I don't see this as an
opportunity. We simply can't handle 10 million extra pieces a
day," said Mr. Coughlin, who called picking up new business
"a secondary consideration."
   The parcel-reservation system, which would give callers a
time and place for bringing in their packages, is set to
begin operation by early next week. However, the timetable
may be moved up a day or more if a strike seems certain.
Postal officials will brief major shippers today and will
meet with representatives of the trucking industry to enlist
their help in carrying the extra volume of parcels.
   "We're a national utility. If this comes about, we want
the public to understand what we're capable of," Mr. Coughlin
said.
