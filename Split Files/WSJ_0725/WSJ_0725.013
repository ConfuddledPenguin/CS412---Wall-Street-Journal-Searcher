   The federal government's use of hospital death rates as an
indicator of health care quality may be flawed, a new study
says.
   Researchers at Rand Corp. found that statistical random
variation and the severity of a patient's condition explained
differences in hospital death rates while quality measures
didn't account for any variation in mortality.

   "You have to be somewhere between cautious and extremely
skeptical about interpreting mortality data as indicators of
poor quality," says Rolla Edward Park, lead author of the
study, which appears in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The report supports critics of the U.S. Health Care
Finance Administration, which for the past three years has
issued mortality data based on Medicare billing information
for each of more than 5,800 hospitals. The hospital industry
consistently has charged that the data are misleading because
they fail to account for severity of illness and other
factors it says can distort a hospital's relative
performance.
   But HCFA, which funded the Rand study, defends its methods
and says they have proven effective in spotting quality
problems. "We think this is an apples versus oranges issue,"
says Gail Wilensky, administrator of HCFA, which oversees the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. "We're not questioning the
Rand study. We don't think their conclusion is particularly
applicable" to the HCFA reports, which are based on many more
disease categories than Rand looked at, and across a much
bigger base of hospitals.
   Ms. Wilensky says her agency will use the report and other
research to improve the quality of its hospital data. But she
also said that HCFA has found quality problems in hospitals
with two consecutive years of excessive deaths. "We have
found the {data make} a useful predictor of where to look
further" for problems, she says.
   Health policy officials hope that as the numbers are
refined, consumers -- including insurers, employers and
referring physicians -- will use the information to choose
health care providers.
   The Rand researchers based their findings on 2,276
Medicare patients -- 1,126 with congestive heart failure and
1,150 who suffered heart attacks -- treated at hospitals in
California, Illinois, Minnesota and New York during a
12-month period ending Sept. 30, 1984. The states represent
one-fifth of the nation's hospitals and Medicare
hospitalizations, and the two diseases account for 7.5% of
Medicare admissions and 17.5% of Medicare deaths, the authors
said. The analysis comprised patients who died in the
hospital and those who died within 30 days of admission.
   The researchers identified "targeted" hospitals, where
mortality rates for the two diagnoses were 5.0 to 10.9 higher
per 100 admissions than in hospitals where death rates fell
within expected ranges. But 56% to 82% of the difference
resulted from "purely random variation," they said, and much
of the remaining difference was due to the severity of the
patients' conditions, especially among heart attack patients.
   Despite the conclusions, Mr. Park says that there is a
correlation between mortality and quality. However, it gets
lost in a statistical analysis of the type of data HCFA
gathers because the other factors are stronger, she says.
Other researchers have suggested that the number of
preventable hospital deaths are so few, that reliable death
rates can't truly be detected by HCFA's methods of gathering
data.
   The Rand researchers suggest that high death rates over
several years may be stronger indicators of hospital quality
problems. HCFA currently bases its analysis on just one year.
Mr. Park suggests that a better method of judging hospital
quality is to sample patients' medical records "to see
whether the things that should have been done for them were
done or not." That would result in a more direct measure of
quality. "Many patients who get bad care {don't} die," he
says.
