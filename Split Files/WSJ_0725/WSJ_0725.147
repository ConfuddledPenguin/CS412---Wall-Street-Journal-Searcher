   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said second-quarter profit
fell 39% because of higher insurance claims and lower results
at its core U.S. retailing business.
   The company said it earned $237.9 million, or 69 cents a
share, compared with $391.2 million, or $1.11 a share, a year
ago. Earnings from continuing operations in last year's
second quarter were $334.9 million, or 95 cents a share.

   Revenue in the period rose 4% to $13.85 billion from
$13.28 billion a year ago.
   The results were slightly better than the grim projection
the company issued earlier this month, which prompted
analysts to lower their forecasts. Consequently, the results
had little impact on Sears stock. In composite trading
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Sears closed at
$33.75, up 12.5 cents.
   Still, some analysts found cause for concern. Expenses at
the Sears merchandise group jumped almost 10% because of what
analysts described as higher advertising costs and increased
reserves for uncollectible credit card balances, but revenue
rose only 2%. "This is the second quarter in a row where
expenses have been a problem," said Wayne Hood of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "They have to demonstrate
that they can drive better revenue growth during the
back-to-school season."
   Sears said merchandise group earnings, which include
international and Sears credit card results as well as its
core U.S. retail business, fell 32% to $110 million from
$161.6 million. But profit at the U.S. retail operation
plunged more precipitously -- by 78% to $17.3 million from
$78.4 million a year earlier.
   Profit at the company's Allstate insurance unit fell 29%
to $142.2 million from $199.8 million because of underwriting
losses, including claims from recent fires in California.
   Earnings at the Dean Witter financial services unit rose
31% to $58.2 million from $44.5 million, reflecting better
Discover credit card results.
   Earnings at the Coldwell Banker real estate unit fell to
$7.3 million from $46.4 million a year ago. Last year's
results included $56.3 million in earnings from discontinued
operations.
   For the first half, Sears said its net income declined 47%
to $344.2 million, or $1.00 a share, from $648.9 million, or
$1.81 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4% to $26.46
billion from $25.44 billion.
