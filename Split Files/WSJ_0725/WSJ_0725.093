   WASHINGTON -- Farm-bloc lawmakers beat back attempts to
trim sugar price supports in both chambers of Congress, but
they couldn't muster enough votes in the Senate to save
beekeepers' honey subsidies from a four-year phase-out.
   The sugar and honey votes were early tests of strength in
a farm-policy struggle between members of the Agriculture
committees and a group of lawmakers who are trying to
overhaul or eliminate several farm-subsidy programs.

   The Senate voted 54-44 to keep the government's sugar
support price at 18 cents a pound for the next five years,
brushing aside arguments that the proposed two-cent cut would
save U.S. consumers $600 million a year and put sugar growers
more on a par with producers of other, less heavily
subsidized crops. Two hours later, the House spurned an
identical measure by an even wider margin, 271-150.
   But in a Senate showdown over the $54 billion, five-year
farm bill, farm-program critics regrouped to win a close
procedural vote 52-46 on the future of the 50-year-old honey
program. The Senate then adopted by unanimous consent a
proposal by Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) to eliminate all
honey price supports by 1994.
   Mr. Chafee contended that the honey program has outlived
its usefulness and benefits only 1% of the nation's 210,000
beekeepers. It cost taxpayers a total of $385 million over
the past five fiscal years, he told colleagues. The House is
expected to vote on a similar provision this week.
   Yesterday, opponents of the sugar program invoked the
environment and the war on drugs in their appeals for votes
-- but to little avail. Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), chief
sponsor of the two-cent cut in the sugar support price,
argued that the U.S. policy of curtailing imports of low-cost
sugar has deprived sugar-producing countries of export
earnings and driven Peruvian farmers into coca production. He
and other critics also said that subsidized expansion of
sugar cane production is polluting the Florida Everglades.
   Defenders of the sugar program mocked the notion of a
cocaine-sugar connection. "The only connection between the
two is that they both happen to be a white powder," asserted
Sen. John Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, a major
sugarcane producing state.
   Pleas in behalf of the consumer failed to carry the day.
Propping domestic sugar prices above the world-market price
"inflicts a hidden tax on food," asserted Rep. Silvio Conte
(D., Mass.). "It's regressive. It smacks the poor harder than
anybody."
   But House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza
(D., Texas) and other pro-sugar members countered that the
sugar program ensures consumers of a stable supply at
reasonable price. They hotly contested assertions that food
processors would pass on to consumers any savings from a cut
of two cents a pound.
