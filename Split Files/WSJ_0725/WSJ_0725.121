   Arbitration Cases Soar
   In Franchising Industry

   FRANCHISING disputes are busting out all over these days.
   The American Arbitration Association says it was called in
to help with 401 such disputes last year, more than five
times the 73 cases in 1981.
   New York City accounted for nearly a fourth of the total,
with 98 cases filed last year. Los Angeles followed with 45
and Orange County, Calif., with 30.
   Robert Coulson, the group's president, attributes the rise
in the caseload to growth in franchising generally and
franchisers' increased use of contracts that require
out-of-court resolution of conflicts. He predicts the volume
will keep rising as the service economy grows and certain
types of franchises reach market saturation. These include
fast food, printing and auto repair.
   Disputes in the franchise industry typically involve such
issues as contract termination, unpaid fees and territorial
rights. Franchisers often prefer arbitration to open-court
airing of disputes, for privacy reasons.
   But arbitration has disadvantages for franchisees, says
San Francisco lawyer Patrick Carter. For instance, he notes
that franchising contracts often require arbitration hearings
to be held in the franchiser's hometown. That means, he says,
out-of-town franchisees may be hard pressed to afford the
trip to make a case.
                                                                                                       

   Entrepreneurs Benefit
   From U.S. Privatization
                                                                                                       

   ENTREPRENEURS have been big winners in the federal
government's privatization campaign.
   A recent study for the U.S. Small Business Administration
shows that 70%, or 552, of the federal contracts awarded in
privatizing efforts from 1985 to 1987 went to small
companies. However, they got just 42% of the $1.7 billion
dollar amount awarded.
   "Small businesses were very aggressive in bidding on these
contracts," says Raymond Marchakitus, an economist with the
SBA's Office of Advocacy. The study shows that small
businesses could, in fact, beat not only the federal
government's costs of doing the work itself but also bigger
companies' bids, he says. To win the contracts, companies
must be able to provide a product or service for at least 10%
less than what it would cost the government.
   The study, performed for the SBA by Research Dimensions
Inc., Alexandria, Va., also indicates that the government
saved at least $189.1 million by contracting to small firms
in the period.
   The SBA is studying how small business participates in
privatizing programs on state and local levels. The study
should be completed by the end of summer.
   One beneficiary of the federal campaign: E C Corp. of Oak
Ridge, Tenn., a supplier of repair, maintenance and other
services to the military, which achieves most of its annual
$17 million of sales through business the government started
contracting out. E C completed contracts for hospital upkeep
at Fort Stewart, Ga., and janitorial work at the Merchant
Marine Academy in New York.
   The chief drawback? Red tape. "The government has the
right ideas about cutting costs" through privatization, says
Michael Randolph, director of E C's services division. But
the bureaucracy makes it "so difficult" to do the work, he
adds. He says some contractors have become so frustrated that
they are shying away from government business.
                                                                                                       

   Small High-Tech Firms
   Hiring at a Rapid Pace
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYMENT at small high-tech businesses is growing at a
much faster rate than among businesses generally.
   While national employment rose 1% in the past 12 months,
employment at small technology companies increased 6%, says
Corporate Technology Information Services Inc., a Woburn,
Mass., business-data publisher. The firm annually surveys
over 30,000 technology firms, including 18,000 with fewer
than 1,000 employees each. In the past 12 months, a total of
22,498 jobs were created at the high-tech firms surveyed, the
company said.
   Small makers of computers and computer systems increased
their work force by more than 7%, the survey says. Meanwhile,
employment at some of the country's biggest computer makers
continued to shrink, it says.
   "Smaller computer systems," made mostly by smaller firms,
"are growing at the expense of larger systems," says Richard
Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter.
   The most rapid growth among the technology companies came
from software makers. The 1,500 computer software companies
in the survey grew at over 10% and added more than 8,000
employees in the past 12 months.
   "Software is becoming increasingly important (for all
companies) -- from running businesses to designing products,"
says Lou Mazzucchelli, a co-founder of Cadre Technologies
Inc., a software concern with offices in Providence, R.I.,
and Beaverton, Ore. Cadre, whose revenue rose nearly 150% to
$50 million last year, increased its staff 30% to 230.
   Demand for new computers and other high-tech products will
continue to fuel rapid employment growth in high-tech firms,
Corporate Technology predicts.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   UNIVERSITIES aren't tapped for help by small firms as
often as by large businesses, says a recent University of
North Carolina study. One reason: Small companies simply
aren't as aware of ways a university can aid them in areas
such as research, production and computer systems. . . .
Seat-of-the-pants: About a third of 2,500 entrepreneurs
recently surveyed run their companies without a financial
plan, says Mid-Atlantic Cos., a New York financial
consultant.
