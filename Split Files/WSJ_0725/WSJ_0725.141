   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- McDonnell Douglas Space
Systems Co. said Lloyd's of London filed a $6 million suit
against the company for alleged negligence in the failed
launch of a satellite last year.
   The suit stems from an accident at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
in June 1989, when a crane hook smashed into an $80 million
communications satellite on a Delta rocket. The satellite,
built by Ford Aerospace Corp. and insured by Lloyd's, was
repaired for around $10 million and launched later. Lloyd's
wants to recover part of the costs.

   The suit alleges that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. unit,
which was responsible for launching the satellite,
"negligently and carelessly planned, simulated, trained for
and conducted the handling and removal procedure," causing
the crane cable to break while loading the satellite onto the
rocket.
   The McDonnell Douglas unit said it has requested that the
suit, filed last month, be transferred to federal court in
Orlando, Fla., from Brevard County Circuit Court in Florida,
as the accident occurred on federal government property.
