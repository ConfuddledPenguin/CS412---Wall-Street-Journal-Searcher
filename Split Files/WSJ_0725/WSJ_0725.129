   Consolidated Edison Co. reported second-quarter net income
sank 25%, reflecting higher operating expenses and interest
charges and lower earnings from investments.
   The New York-based utility's profit fell to $49.1 million,
or 18 cents a share, from $65.7 million, or 24 cents a share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose 3% to $1.26 billion from $1.22
billion.

   Operating expense rose 4.4% to $1.16 billion, reflecting
particularly a 15% jump in the costs of fuel Con Ed uses and
of power it buys from outside sources. Investment earnings
dropped 38% to $15.6 million, while net interest charges rose
8.7% to $61.6 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Con Ed's shares closed unchanged at $23 a share.
