   Schools in urban Compton, hard by the Watts section of Los
Angeles, suffer from gang violence, teacher job actions, low
student achievement and budget shortfalls -- the usual litany
of inner-city education woes.
   But hard-pressed as it is, Compton spends $210,000 a year
on an innovation that it hopes will help lead it out of the
morass -- outside consultants. The consulting firm, Sage
Analytics International Inc., of Provo, Utah, has interviewed
hundreds of teachers, students and parents at 21 Compton
schools, diagnosed the system's ills with proprietary
computer software, and is now helping revamp curriculum.

   Although problems still abound, school officials say they
see improvement in rising test scores, better attendance and
fewer crimes at high schools. "I would never say we couldn't
have done it without Sage . . . but they certainly made it a
great deal easier," says Oliver Miller, principal of
Compton's Centennial High School.
   As concern about education grows, more schools are turning
to consultants for help. The consultants acknowledge they
possess no wonder drugs for sick schools. Sometimes their
presence becomes controversial. But they can be a valuable
catalyst for energizing schools with low morale, and their
fresh outside views often lead to policy changes.
   In the past, schools have used outsiders such as local
universities for management advice, usually at no cost and
for limited purposes. But a new breed of consultants has
emerged in the current push for school change. They take
fees, paid by the schools themselves, government or private
benefactors. They often aim for school turnarounds measurable
in student performance. And whether run for profit or not,
they actively seek new clients.
   Last month, the Dade County, Fla., school system took the
consultancy idea to its ultimate, awarding a five-year
contract to Education Alternatives Inc., a Minneapolis
operator of private schools, to create a public elementary
school from the ground up. The school, expected to open in
the fall of 1991, will get the standard per-pupil outlay of
other Dade schools. Education Alternatives, which will design
the curriculum and pick its own principal and staff, is
promising higher student achievement.
   Outsiders rarely get this much say, but their influence is
spreading. In January, as part of its school-aid program,
Citicorp said it would pay Sage $7.2 million over five years
to advise 20 new schools, adding to its current total of 125.
The Quality Education Project, a not-for-profit consulting
group based in San Francisco, will advise 300 schools this
September, up from 240 in the last school year. One of the
best-known school gurus, Brown University's Theodore Sizer,
will add 50 schools to his 109-school network over the next
year or so.
   Much of the impetus comes from increased corporate
philanthropy. Mr. Sizer's Coalition for Essential Schools has
received $24 million in gifts or pledges since 1984 from
Aetna, Coca-Cola, Citicorp, Exxon, General Foods, Pacific
Telesis, Xerox and UPS. These corporations say schools are
training tomorrow's workers poorly.
   Another spur is the increasing call for schools to show
better results. The demand is coming from state education
departments, local businesses and media, and brutally
critical national reports.
   "School boards feel the pressure out there," says Frank
Lynch, principal of Petaluma High School in Petaluma, Calif.
"People are more willing to let {outside} people in, turn the
place topsy-turvy and start all over again."
   "Before, if the kids were doing poorly, you retained the
kids," says Jeffry Schiller, director of program development
for the schools in Prince George's County, Md. "Now you bring
in outside help."
   Prince George's County uses a variety of consultants,
including Sage and Lawrence Lezotte, a $2,000-a-day
consultant based in Okemos, Mich. Mr. Lezotte's ideas are
based on so-called effective-schools research, which stresses
high goals for all students, frequent evaluations and strong
principals.
   John Murphy, the district's superintendent, says Mr.
Lezotte's advice has led to improvements such as higher
standardized test scores and more rigor. The number of
students taking first-year algebra in the district, he says,
has risen to 75% from 15% in 1984.
   But to some teachers, the consultancy is a mixed blessing.
Margaret Spirer, president of the district's teacher's union,
says Mr. Lezotte's preachings can be used selectively as an
unfair weapon against teachers whose students don't show
test-score improvement. She says the reviews don't take into
account students' family income and other social factors --
even though those factors can, in Mr. Lezotte's view, affect
learning.
   Despite those reservations, she says Mr. Lezotte has
"inspired a lot of people" in the district to do better.
   Consultants' philosophies vary as much as schools'
problems do. Among Mr. Sizer's chief tenets is the teaching
of a few subjects in depth, rather than offering wide
variety. Sage, on the other hand, doesn't go in with a
prepared prescription. Instead, it surveys school employees,
students and parents for their gripes, then relies on
computer software it designed to sort the complaints and
identify root problems.
   The College for Human Services, a business college in New
York that is a consultant to about a half-dozen schools,
contends that schools are failing partly because they don't
try hard enough to show students how lessons can help them in
the real world.
   For P.S. 30, an elementary school in the Bronx whose
neighborhood suffers from heavy drug abuse, the college
helped organize fourth-grade studies last school year around
a theme of improving community health. Supermarket food
labels were studied and content disclosures used in studying
percentages and fractions. Writing assignments covered the
hazards of eating too much salt, Florence Nightingale's
biography was used in reading, and doctors from Albert
Einstein Hospital were guest teachers in science classes. In
April, the Hasbro Children's Foundation gave the college $1
million to add four schools outside New York to its network.
   The Quality Education Project stresses parental
involvement. Once it is retained, it demands that parents
sign cards pledging they will make their children go to bed
by 9 p.m., do their homework, and read aloud 15 minutes a
day. The parents also promise to provide a quiet studying
place at home and to attend school parent-teacher nights and
open houses. Teachers are asked to phone parents and urge
compliance, and are given logs by QEP to keep track of
results.
   The requirements may seem elementary, but "it's been an
amazing success," says Robert Aguilar, a teacher at
Montgomery High School in San Diego, where QEP has been
working since the 1988-89 school year. He says that
attendance at parents night has gone up to 1,200 from 70,
more homework is being turned in, and grades and state test
scores are up.
