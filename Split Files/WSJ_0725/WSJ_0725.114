   NEW YORK -- Profit-taking helped the dollar stabilize
yesterday after the slide it suffered on a 56.44-point drop
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average the preceding day.
   As the industrial average rebounded to post a 17.82 point
gain, the U.S. currency finished mixed. Dollar trading was
eclipsed by activity in the pound, which dropped unexpectedly
against all major currencies, especially the mark.

   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6215 marks, down slightly from 1.6220 marks late Monday in
New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 148.78
yen, up from 148.20 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was
trading at $1.8133, down from $1.8255 late Monday.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 148.95 yen
soon after the opening; it closed at 148.70 yen in Tokyo
Tuesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6258 marks, up from Tokyo's Tuesday close of 1.6260 marks.
   The pound's fall, which began shortly after noon in New
York, only minutes after the end of the trading day in
London, dominated traders' attention on a suddenly busy
afternoon.
   "The primary activity has been in cross-rate trading,"
said Richard Witten, vice president and foreign exchange
trader at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in New York. He said the
market in particular focused on the pound and mark.
   Dealers have watched the pound hover mostly between 2.96
marks and 2.99 marks for several weeks, believing that the
British government wants to drive the currency to the
three-mark level before entering it into the fixed exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   The pound fell decisively out of that range yesterday,
slipping well below 2.93 marks before finding support at
2.9275 marks. Late in the U.S. day, sterling had recovered
somewhat to 2.9403 marks.
   The suddenness of the pound's decline surprised traders
because no special news had reached the markets after
sterling's close in London at 2.9541 marks. It had finished
in New York Monday at 2.9610 marks.
   "Fundamentally, there are no real reasons why the pound
should fall," said David Jaques, senior corporate trader at
Barclays Bank in New York. But he and others noted that the
pound has been attractive only for the high U.K. interest
rates that the government has used against inflation.
Overall, the country is besieged by high inflation and
unemployment and by low productivity, he said.
   "A decline like this overall isn't something that should
be a surprise" in light of the economy's troubles, said Mr.
Jaques. "But the actual timing of this move didn't have any
explanation."
   Goldman's Mr. Witten noted that the pound's easing against
the mark actually began last week, as dealers were drawn
toward the German currency on fears of a drop in interest
rates in the U.S.
   Yesterday, when the pound began to slide in New York,
trading volume became "quite, quite heavy," noted Ty Tan, a
dealer with Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank in New York.
   The dollar ended European dealings weaker against major
currencies. One dealer said the Federal Reserve might be
tempted to lower interest rates in the wake of Monday's sharp
drop in the U.S. stock market.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $367.90 an ounce, down $1.20. Estimated
volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold opened for trading at $366.45
an ounce.
