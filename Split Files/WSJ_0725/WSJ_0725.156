   Tambrands Inc. said second-quarter net income rose 21%,
reflecting improved margins, work-force reductions and the
divestitures of its home diagnostics and cosmetics businesses
this year.
   The maker of personal-care products said second-quarter
results were records; net rose to $31.8 million, or $1.49 a
share, from $26.2 million, or $1.17 a share; sales rose 1.9%
to $169.3 million from $166.1 million. There were about one
million fewer average shares outstanding in the latest
quarter.

   Tambrands, of Lake Success, N.Y., said the fact that sales
rose despite the divestitures reflected a product
introduction in the U.S. and increased shipments in Europe.
   For the six months, net rose 22% to $53.8 million, or
$2.50 a share, from $44.2 million, or $1.98 a share. Revenue
rose to $328.5 million from $296 million.
