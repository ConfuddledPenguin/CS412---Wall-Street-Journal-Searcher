   TOKYO -- Japan's central bank is spooking world financial
markets, in the process sending Japanese interest rates
climbing and the Tokyo stock market falling.
   Essentially, top monetary policy makers in Tokyo want the
financial markets to believe that the Bank of Japan is ready
to raise interest rates further to fend off inflation in
Japan before this becomes a problem.

   Until last week, the financial markets had considered the
central bank's tough stance mere posturing, the necessary
bluster of a good watchdog. But as interest rates in Tokyo's
credit markets began creeping higher, stock and bond markets
in Japan and elsewhere started to panic. Then the Bank of
Japan retreated, explaining that it isn't tightening credit,
rather just holding firm.
   "They really backed off," Patricia Kurayama, J.P. Morgan
Trust Bank Ltd.'s chief economist in Japan, said. "They're
trying to compensate for the fright they gave people."
   The fright was real enough. Since Friday, the Nikkei
average of 225 stocks has lost 1,353.16 points, or 4.1%, its
steepest drop since it came out of a three-monthlong nose
dive in early April. On Tuesday, the index closed at
31702.46, off 192.33 points from Monday.
   Japanese bond yields are hovering at their highest levels
in more than six years. The No. 119 10-year government bond
rose 0.12 to 85.83, to yield 7.445%, its first gain in six
trading sessions. (This yield is eqivalent to a 6.95%
semiannual compounded yield to maturity.)
   "Interest rates are almost the entire picture" in the
markets, Christopher Taylor, head of sales at Baring
Securities (Japan) Ltd., a British brokerage house, said.
"There's a lot of confusion in the market," Russell Jones, an
analyst at UBS Philips &amp; Drew Securities Ltd., said.
   The jitters aren't confined to Tokyo. The steep drop in
stocks and related futures in the U.S. on Monday was ascribed
at least in part to worries that Japan might raise interest
rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 56.44 points
to 2904.70 Monday, and at one point was off 105 points.
   Many analysts fear that an increase in the Bank of Japan
official discount rate, the amount it charges on loans to
financial institutions, could trigger an international round
of credit tightening -- a cycle Japanese officials
desperately want to avoid.
   Yet this could be the embarrassing outcome of a formal
increase in Japanese rates just now. In the U.S., the Federal
Reserve has been allowing interest rates to slide slightly in
recent weeks, and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has hinted at
further easing. But if Japan raises its rates, economists
said, the difference between U.S. and Japanese rates, after
adjustment for inflation, might widen sufficiently to
discourage big Japanese investors from buying U.S. Treasury
bonds.
   After deducting the effects of inflation, Japanese
government bonds already yield about 0.3 to 0.4 of a
percentage point more than comparable long-term U.S. Treasury
bonds. "It's obvious," a bond-market analyst in Japan said.
"You can make more on a Japanese bond and not take a
foreign-exchange risk."
   With the U.S. Treasury planning a $31.5 billion bond sale
in the second week of August, an increase in Japanese rates
now could be especially damaging. To entice Japanese
investors, analysts said, U.S. rates would have to rise.
   In large measure, the financial markets' case of nerves
can be ascribed to traumatic memories of the last formal
credit tightening by the Bank of Japan. The Tokyo stock
market had managed to ignore three increases that brought
Japan's discount rate from its historic low of 2.5% in May to
4.25% at the end of last year, when the Nikkei average of 225
major stocks stood at a record high of 38915.87.
   But the Japanese stock market started coming unglued early
this year. By the time the Bank of Japan boosted the discount
rate a fourth time, to 5.25%, on March 20, the stock market
was plunging. Before it stabilized, the Nikkei index plunged
more than 27% from its peak. Memories of the stock market
turmoil are still fresh, analysts said.
   "One of the things that has stayed the Bank of Japan's
hand recently is the Japanese stock market," Aaron M. Cohen,
senior financial economist at Daiwa Securities Co., said.
"The stock market's weakness is the one big deterrent to
raising official rates."
   Economists and central-bank watchers are divided on the
question of whether the Bank of Japan really needs -- or
intends -- to raise rates. The Japanese economy grew at a
rapid 10.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and isn't
slowing down noticeably. The Bank of Japan on Friday said the
second quarter was unexpectedly strong, too. But inflation
has been tame; June's wholesale prices increased only 0.9%
from a year earlier.
   Still, Robert Alan Feldman, an economist at Salomon
Brothers Inc.'s Tokyo office, believes the Japanese central
bank already has painted itself into a corner by allowing
money market rates to reach such high levels. Some rates, he
noted, are certain to rise; Japan's long-term credit banks
are negotiating to raise their prime lending rate this week,
with most market participants expecting an increase of 0.3
percentage point. This would mean Japanese companies would
pay a minimum of 7.9% on long-term loans, the same as they
paid in May.
   With other interest rates rising, the Bank of Japan has
"very little choice now" but to raise rates, "because the
economy is not slowing down," Mr. Feldman said. "It's just a
matter of timing." He speculated that the central bank might
wait until after the U.S. government's August bond sale -- or
even until after German monetary authorities succumb to the
financial pressures of reunification and raise their official
interest rates.
   Nobuyuki Ueda, senior economist at Long-Term Bank of Japan
Ltd., agrees that because of the feverish first-quarter
growth rate, an increase in Japanese interest rates within
the next four or five months is inevitable. "I don't think
the timing is important, but the future trend of interest
rates is definitely up," he said.
   But other analysts said it isn't clear that the Bank of
Japan will raise rates. The central bank openly sought to
play down its own credit-tightening moves in the markets
Friday and early this week, with its governor, Yasushi Mieno,
even stating publicly that the moves were misread by the
market.
   And at a meeting last week of the central bank's branch
managers, only a handful of the regional chiefs favored
another discount-rate increase. The consensus, according to
participants, was that the central bank should wait longer
before judging the effects of the last discount-rate increase
and the ensuing increases in market rates.
   For Japanese policy makers, these are delicate times.
Officials would like to avoid an interest-rate increase that
could choke off the nation's 44-month-long economic boom.
   Yet partly as a result of the central bank's decision in
February 1987 to reduce its discount rate to 2.5%, stock and
land prices in Japan soared. The vast sums generated by this
so-called asset inflation continue to slosh around Japan --
and are the chief target of the current efforts by the Bank
of Japan to crimp spending.
   In addition, the Japanese government is looking ahead at a
decade of relatively generous fiscal policy. As part of a
major economic agreement reached last month with Washington,
the Japanese government has agreed to pump 430 trillion yen
($2.902 trillion) into public works projects over the next
decade. The aim is to reduce the Japanese public's savings.
The effect, though, will be to pour fresh money into the
economy, at a time when the central bank is trying to curb
spending.
