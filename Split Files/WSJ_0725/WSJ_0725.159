   WASHINGTON -- Keystone Camera Corp. lost its bid for
higher tariffs and import quotas on fixed-focus cameras using
35-millimeter and 110-type film.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled 4-0 that
such imports, which totaled about $689 million last year,
aren't injuring a domestic industry.

   Keystone's petition had been opposed by Eastman Kodak Co.,
Rochester, N.Y., and other camera manufacturers and
importers.
   ITC Chairman Anne Brunsdale said that Keystone Camera, a
subsidiary of Keystone Camera Products Corp., Clifton, N.J.,
had failed to show that imports supplied by Eastman Kodak and
foreign-owned companies have been a "substantial cause" of
injury to Keystone.
   David Rohr, another ITC member, said the economic
difficulties cited by Keystone in its petition resulted more
from a "failure" of that company's marketing strategy than
from import competition.
   Keystone had told the ITC that it had tried to meet stiff
import competition in the marketing of its fixed-focus
cameras, but would be forced to shift production to foreign
plants if the government turned down its bid for import
restrictions.
   The imports come primarily from Japan and other Asian
countries but have been coming in growing volume from Brazil
and cross-border assembly plants in Mexico.
   Although Eastman Kodak was identified during the ITC
inquiry as an importer, Chairman Brunsdale noted that the
company is a major domestic camera manufacturer even though
it assembles fixed-focus cameras in foreign plants for
eventual sale in the U.S.
   The ITC will send a report on its investigation to the
White House later, but yesterday's unanimous decision against
import restrictions means President Bush won't be required to
take any follow-up action under U.S. trade laws.
