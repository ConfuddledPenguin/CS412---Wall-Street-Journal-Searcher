   MINNETONKA, Minn. -- Tonka Corp. reported a second-quarter
loss of $19 million, or $1.30 a share, reflecting declines in
its maturing Ghostbusters line and its discontinued Sega
video game line.
   A year earlier, the toy maker earned $100,000, or two
cents a share. Revenue fell 23% to $146.3 million from $189.4
million.

   The company, which earlier this year predicted a
"significant" second-quarter loss, also cited disappointing
early sales of "certain" promotional products, which it
didn't name. It added that revenue gains at its Parker
Brothers and Tonka International divisions only partly offset
declines at its Kenner and Tonka Products units.
   On a pretax basis, the loss was at the pessimistic end of
analysts' expectations. But the company said it adopted a
conservative approach for its first-half tax accrual,
resulting in "only limited tax benefits" from the
second-quarter pretax loss.
   The announcement came after the market closed, and
analysts were still reviewing their full-year forecasts late
yesterday. Carol Palmer of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. said she
expects Tonka to scale back its marketing plans in Europe
somewhat in an attempt to control expenses.
   In the first six months, the loss widened to $29.3
million, or $2.01 a share, from $6 million, or 76 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20% to $282.2 million
from $351.6 million.
   Tonka Chairman Stephen G. Shank said he was "disappointed"
by first-half results but continues "to expect a profitable
second half." He described as "excellent" the early retail
results of the company's Batman action figures and vehicles,
adding that they could become a "significant contributor" to
revenue in the second half. He also said he is "very
encouraged" by early retail sales of Kenner's Baby Alive doll
and preliminary test-market results of Tonka Products' new
line of stuffed toys called Wrestling Buddies.
   However, the company said it is "uncertain whether
second-half results will be sufficient to offset the
first-half deficit, and there is a real possibility that
Tonka will not be profitable for the year."
