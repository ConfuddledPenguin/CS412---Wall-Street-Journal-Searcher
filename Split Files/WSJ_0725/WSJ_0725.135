   MOUNTAINVIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., turning up
the heat on its competitors in the workstation business, is
set to unveil today its least expensive color computer.
   Aimed at engineers and scientists, the workstation will
cost about $8,000, industry observers said. It will run at
speeds faster than Sun's new $5,000 SCL computer but slower
than its $9,000 Sparcstation 1.

   Sun also is expected to disclose plans to sell some of its
products through personal-computer retailers for the first
time. The company initially has tapped three retailers for
the task, Tempe, Ariz.-based MicroAge Inc., Exton, Pa.-based
Intelligent Electronics Inc., and New York-based Nynex
Corp.'s retail arm.
   The move represents a continuation of Sun's efforts to
expand its distribution. It now sells its products directly
or through specialists in the sale of high-end systems.
   "Sun has a large-enough installed base that many customers
really just want to expand their networks by adding more
machines," said Seymour Merrin, a computer retail analyst in
Palo Alto, Calif. He said personal-computer retailers should
be able to handle those customers, giving Sun "a place on
store shelves that will be hard for competitors to take
away."
