   Venice -- At this year's Venice Biennale you find yourself
fervently wishing that the dismal quality of most of the art
could be blamed on the poor judgment of the organizers.
Instead, the exposition really does reflect some important
international trends and changes in taste. What actually
seems to be taking place is a general move toward a less
demanding notion of what art is and what it can do for the
people who experience it. In particular, there is a broad
sense of confusion between art and entertainment through ever
more mindless repetition and ever more kitsch.
   This slackening of standards seems to be reflected in the
increasing confusion about the already indistinct boundaries
between the various categories for which prizes are given. In
fact, the awarding of the prizes at this year's Biennale was
nothing short of perverse. The painting prize went to the
Italian Giovanni Anselmo, for his elegant but boringly
repetitious series of wall-mounted granite slabs, which most
people would consider relief sculpture. By the same addled
logic, the sculpture prize went to an iterative set of
photographs of industrial buildings by the West German
artists Bernd and Hilla Becher.

   There was some consolation -- in fact it was a sort of
consolation prize -- in the award for best young artist.
Anish Kapoor's grand and mysterious stone sculptures were the
very best things in the whole Biennale anyway, and deserved
even better from the judges. But the topsy-turvy system
prevailed again, since Mr. Kapoor is not, at 36 years of age,
a younger artist, except in the sense that he is younger than
the artists who are older than he is. Moreover, his work
fills the entire British pavilion instead of being displayed
with the other "youngers" in the Aperto section at the
Arsenale.
   As widely expected, the prize for the best national
exhibit went to the U.S. for the elaborate mixed-media
installation by Jenny Holzer, the first woman to represent
the U.S. at a Biennale. I wish I could wax enthusiastic about
this landmark event, but I found Ms. Holzer's installation
unutterably pretentious. Even the endlessly varied flashing
lights reflected on the impressively shiny marble floors
could not give luster to the embarrassing platitudes they
spelled out. This is not only the most overbearingly
repetitious display at the Biennale, but in its own
middlebrow way it also is a form of kitsch: overwrought,
slick and full of inflated sentiment.
   Back in the days when Ms. Holzer plastered her slogans on
New York City bus stops, they had a certain charm. But what
went over well as ephemera doesn't play at all when carved in
stone. Now that Ms. Holzer has taken this giant step for
womankind, one can only hope she will devote her energies to
mental development and reflection so that her thoughts can
match the complexity of her technical means.
   To a certain extent, the numbing boredom of Ms. Holzer's
pieces and that of the other repetitive artists on display
stems from their decision to work in mixed media. Because
this art lacks intrinsic value, substance, drama, subtlety of
color -- really anything at all that would cause anyone to
linger in front of them, they impose themselves on art-goers
by filling space, and this they do through redundancy, by
reproducing facsimiles of the kernel of banality that defines
them.
   Reinhard Mucha's clusters of little chairs stuffed into
tall glass cases would be lost in the large marble interior
of the West German pavilion if they were not rhythmically
repeated. Similarly, in the Japanese pavilion, Toshikatsu
Endo's tar-soaked logs and Saburo Muraoka's large iron books
and pedestals need the insistence of repetition to give drama
to what are not very exciting individual forms.
   The use of such repeated forms goes back to the very
beginning of modern art and is as much a part of the
modernist aesthetic as it is a part of modern life. Here,
regrettably, that repetition is mostly a kind of filler,
rather than a source of density and strength.
   Kitsch is also one of the characteristic features of
modern life. But only in recent years has it become a direct
presence on the art scene. At this year's Biennale it
achieves a kind of apotheosis, and informs a new
international artistic language based on the cheap, ironic
simulacrum of complexity, the pretense of meaningful
ambiguity in works whose other implications all are painfully
obvious.
   Dutch artist Rob Scholte's slickly rendered pictures of
toy clowns, and of monkeys painting pictures, look as if they
were found in a five-and-10-cent store a decade ago. Antoni
Miralda's installation in the Spanish pavilion, complete with
a large fetishistic shoe and a giant bouquet of pink flowers,
makes a nod toward radical social critique but remains rooted
in kitsch.
   The Israeli-born artist Izhar Patkin sculpts gaudy
cowboy-like renderings of Don Quixote that would be
appropriate on the most vulgar theme-park carousel.
   Leading this pack, the U.S. artist Jeff Koons, reigning
king of art-kitsch, has brought to Venice a sort of homage to
Italy and Italian womanhood. Mr. Koons's large wooden
sculpture and five even larger paintings portray the artist
having sex with the Italian politician and ex-porn star known
as La Cicciolina.
   Although Mr. Koons no doubt meant this to be the most
shocking piece in the Biennale, he was upstaged by the
American group known as Gran Fury. It is exhibiting posters
on the subject of AIDS and related issues. What made the
Italians truly "furioso" was not Gran Fury's sloganeering
about sex and contraception, but a poster in which a picture
of the pope was garlanded with propaganda he officially
deplores. Local feelings against this sacrilegious lampoon
ran so high that the poster almost was removed. Almost. The
Biennale gets no money from the NEA.
