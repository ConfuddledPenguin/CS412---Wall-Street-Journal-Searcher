   LOS ANGELES -- Ever wonder what happened to actress
Loretta Swit, who played Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan
on the TV series "MASH"?
   The series ended, but Ms. Swit's TV career lives on --
she's now starring in low-budget TV ads for the AM/PM Mini
Markets, a local chain of 24-hour convenience stores. A
current ad starts with a close-up of the actress's lips and
pulls back as Ms. Swit talks up the chain's frozen yogurt
bar. That's right, not Diet Coke or American Express -- but
frozen yogurt at the AM/PM Mini Market.

   Celebrities once were wary of product endorsements, and
the hottest ones often steered clear of them entirely. These
days, however, high-caliber celebrities such as Madonna and
Paul Newman do endorsements for national advertisers. So the
lesser lights are working for smaller clients.
   Nowhere is that clearer than in Los Angeles, where many
television actors reside, making them readily available and
affordable for small jobs.
   Ms. Swit, who at one time appeared in a national ad
campaign for IBM, is hardly the only TV star to appear in a
local commercial here. Local TV and radio stations are
crammed with ads for off-price clothing outlets, car
dealerships, furniture stores, tool shops and more that
feature actors famous at one time or another for their
television roles.
   Scott Baio ("Happy Days") is in ads for the $5 Clothing
Stores, a chain of shops where no item costs more than $8.
Tom Poston ("Newhart") pitches the July sale at J.H. Biggar
furniture stores. Adrienne Barbeau ("Maude" and 1989's
made-for-video movie "Cannibal Women in the Avacado Jungle of
Death") did ads for the Campbell Automotive Group, a cluster
of car dealerships. Michael Constantine ("Leap of Faith," a
TV movie) pitched Murata Pearl, a jewelry store chain.
   Few of the ads -- most of them painfully low-budget -- are
likely contenders for the Clio ad awards. But agents and
marketing executives in this town say local advertisers more
than ever are lining up at the door to sign on actors to hawk
their products.
   "Some of the clients hire TV stars because they like to
hang around them, particularly the smaller retailers," says
Richard Perlmutter, president of Radio Play, a Los Angeles
radio production company that has done scores of such ads.
"If you're dealing with a local car dealer and they have a
choice of using Adrienne Barbeau or some other actress who
sounds like her, you're going to pick Adrienne Barbeau."
   One recent radio ad Mr. Perlmutter supervised featured
actress Edie McClurg ("The Hogan Family") pitching the
American Tool Exchange, a one-location tool store in North
Hollywood. He has worked with lots of TV actors, including
Teresa Ganzel (star of the short-lived sitcom "The Duck
Factory").
   Association with the perceived glamour of a TV actor is a
major reason local advertisers hook up with celebs. But cost
is another big factor. Industry executives say the former
sitcom stars often work for scale -- $366 a day for TV ads,
less for radio commercials -- just as no-name actors do.
   "From an economic standpoint, {Mr. Baio} was somebody that
we could afford," Morrie Dym, president and owner of the $5
Clothing Stores, admits flatly. Besides, he adds quickly,
"he's got very high-name recognition and he's a good-looking
guy." Mr. Dym says, though, that Mr. Baio was paid
substantially above scale, although significantly less than
actor Johnny Depp ("21 Jump Street"), his first choice,
demanded for the job.
   "The taboos {of doing TV ads} aren't as strong as they
once were," says Jeff Danis, an agent in the commercials
department at the high-powered ICM agency. He believes that
the use of celebrities in regional ads isn't strictly a Los
Angeles trend, noting that his clients have done ads for
other regional markets.
   But Los Angeles clearly has the vast majority of such ads.
And executives at big ad agencies here are downright
embarrassed by many of the local spots. They swear they're
not to blame, saying they are the work of small advertisers
who don't know any better.
   "Celebrities ought to have a little bit to do with what
they're selling. . . . There ought to be a bit of a
relationship there," says Brent Bouchez, executive vice
president and creative director at Ketchum Advertising, Los
Angeles. "They can be great when they have a strong
relationship with the product or service. Otherwise, there's
really no reason for them to be."
   Most of the advertisers, though, have such tiny
advertising budgets that their accounts aren't serviced at
big California shops like Ketchum or D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp;
Bowles, for example. Many locals use very small ad shops;
others hire a copywriter on a free-lance basis and pay him to
write a script.
   Mr. Dym defends his choice of Mr. Baio to appear in the
chain's TV ads, saying that the audience of "Charles in
Charge," the actor's most recent sitcom, is the target
audience for the store, too.
   In one ad, a teen-age girl says "Clothes for $5? What are
you, crazy? Yeah, and Scott Baio's going to ask me for a
date]" An elevator opens just then, and -- surprise -- Mr.
Baio steps out, leaving the girl and a friend in awe. At the
end of the spot, she bumps into him again -- and this time
the two get into a limousine. "Believe it]" the girl says.
   Mr. Dym says he doesn't think the actor has ever actually
been inside one of his stores. "Maybe his mother and his
sister have gone," he says.

   Interpublic Net Rose 9.3%
                                                                                                       

   Interpublic Group, New York, reported second-quarter net
income rose 9.3% to $30.9 million, or 92 cents a share, from
$28.3 million, or 84 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period.
   Revenue rose 8% to $342.4 million from $317.1 million,
with a big revenue jump from operations outside the U.S.
Interpublic posted a decrease in revenue from U.S.
operations, citing "slower economic growth." The company said
the lower U.S. revenue was also affected by the exchange in
July 1989 of its interest in Lowe Marschalk, an ad agency
that has been renamed Lowe &amp; Partners, for an increased stake
in its parent, Lowe PLC.
