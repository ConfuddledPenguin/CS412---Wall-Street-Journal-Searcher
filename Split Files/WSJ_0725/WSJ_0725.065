   CHICAGO -- Sutton Holding Corp. dropped its long-running
$50-a-share, or about $200 million tender offer for DeSoto
Inc., after watching its target agree to asset sales that
amount to a near-liquidation.
   The New York investor group, which holds about a 15% stake
in the Des Plaines, Ill., maker of paints, chemicals and
detergents, launched the bid in November. DeSoto fought the
bid as too low, and the parties eventually reached a Delaware
court. In February, after a Chancery Court judge ordered
DeSoto to "maximize shareholder value," the company responded
by putting all its operations on the block.

   Throughout the winter, spring and summer, Sutton
repeatedly extended its bid, which was conditioned on receipt
of at least 90% of the company's outstanding shares. But
DeSoto's stock traded at a substantial discount to Sutton's
offer price, indicating investors had significant
reservations about the offer's viability.
   Earlier this month, DeSoto announced agreements to sell
its biggest operations for a total of $280 million. It
expects to distribute to shareholders the net proceeds from
those sales, along with excess funds tapped from its pension
plans -- together representing about $42.81 a share. DeSoto
has yet to sell certain minor proprietary technology rights;
it plans to retain only its detergent business, which had
1989 revenue of about $72 million.
   Sutton said it is "disappointed" DeSoto "didn't pursue our
offer," adding that the investor group will "continue to
review the situation and determine what actions, if any are
appropriate."
   Sutton also said that three of its designees, including
Chairman William Spier, were named DeSoto directors, boosting
board membership to 13. The board representation comes out of
an April agreement between DeSoto and Sutton, the group said.
It added that as part of that agreement, "Certain litigation
between Sutton and DeSoto pending in the Delaware courts has
also been dismissed."
