   NORWALK, Conn. -- The American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants plans to start issuing guidelines on
financial accounting issues without Financial Accounting
Standards Board agreement.
   In the past, the AICPA, the field's major professional
organization, has advised the FASB whenever it chose to issue
guidelines on financial accounting and reporting standards.
Although the FASB didn't control the AICPA decisions, any
FASB objections offered were taken into account.

   The FASB is the accounting profession's chief rule-making
body, while the AICPA guidelines tend to focus on more
technical matters.
   Both groups aired their views at the FASB headquarters
here. Thomas P. Kelley, group vice president, professional,
for the AICPA, said its board's action gives it an explicit
ability to issue guidelines. "There is a feeling that we
should become more active in the accounting standards area,"
Mr. Kelley said. He said the AICPA wanted to speed up the
process, noting that the FASB sometimes has difficulty
reaching agreement.
   But some critics fear the policy change will prove
confusing to accountants. P. Norman Roy, president of the
Financial Executives Institute, said the change would be
"extremely divisive."
   The FASB plans to draft a response.
