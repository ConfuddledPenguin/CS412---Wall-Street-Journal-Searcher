   TRENTON, N.J. -- A federal grand jury returned a
four-count indictment for wire fraud against a Houston
distributor of asbestos-removal equipment.
   According to the indictment, Critical Industries Inc.
fixed prices for respirators and filters used by workers who
remove asbestos from schools, restaurants and other public
buildings. Also charged in the indictment was Paul Burns,
president of Critical Industries.

   Since February of this year, Critical Services Inc., a
unit of Critical Industries, has been one of two companies
marketing respirators and filters manufactured by Mine Safety
Appliances Company Inc., Pittsburgh, in certain markets. The
indictments charge that Mr. Burns phoned an executive of the
rival distributor, Asbestor Control Technologies Inc.,
Pennsauken, N.J., in an unsuccessful attempt to fix prices.
   Company spokesman J. Gordon Beittenmiller said that Mr.
Burns and Critical Industries "continue to believe that no
crime has been committed and intend to defend themselves
vigorously" against the indictments.
