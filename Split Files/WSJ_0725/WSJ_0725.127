   Before picking Judge David Souter of New Hampshire to fill
a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, President Bush
interviewed another candidate, administration officials said.
   The president's other top candidate was federal appeals
court Judge Edith Jones of Houston, the officials said. They
said Mr. Bush summoned both Judge Jones and Judge Souter to
Washington and talked to each in the White House Monday.

   About 4:15 p.m., two hours after completing the
interviews, Mr. Bush called Judge Souter into the private
presidential study and told him he had been chosen. Mr. Bush
then announced the decision at a 5 p.m. press conference.
   Other top contenders, the officials said, were federal
appeals court Judge Laurence Silberman of Washington and
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. The disclosure of the other
candidates may be significant, because it could give clues
about Mr. Bush's preferences if another seat opens on the
Supreme Court.
   Separately, the White House said that it has enlisted
Kenneth Duberstein, who was former President Reagan's chief
of staff, to devise a strategy for shepherding the Souter
nomination through the Senate confirmation process. Mr.
Duberstein, who also is a former White House legislative
liaison, has extensive contacts with Republicans and
Democrats on Capitol Hill.
