   SEEING IS RELIEVING, as computer displays help IRS phone
aides help filers.
   The accuracy of replies to inquiries on tax law improved
markedly last spring to about 77% from 63% in 1989's filing
season. But that isn't good enough, and the IRS has great
hopes for more gains with a system that helped Boston-area
aides boost their accuracy rate to 79% from 58%. When an aide
feeds in a tax topic raised by a caller's inquiry, the system
displays a series of questions that prompt the aide to probe
for information that will identify the exact issue and lead
to the correct answer.

   It isn't clear how much of the gain in Boston was due to
this system and how much to other actions. But Assistant
Commissioner Brand says the project was deemed a success and
will be extended next year to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas
and Los Angeles. It is to be expanded to all areas in later
years. The system also makes it much easier to update files
of technical information for phone assisters, Brand adds.
   The anticipated cost through 1994 of installing the system
throughout the nation is $60 million.
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER NEW SYSTEM speeds up the not-so-simple job of
verifying names.
   Until April, the 15,000 data-retrieval terminals in IRS
district offices and service centers didn't have direct
access to data from master files. Lacking account data in
local files, workers couldn't immediately verify names,
addresses, and Social Security numbers of people calling for
account information. It could take weeks to correct an error
that delayed or misdirected an IRS reply. Now a system called
OLE lets a terminal operator call up a central file and
compare ID data in seconds.
   OLE is averaging 160,000 queries a day. It also
crosschecks spouses' names and numbers. It soon will be used
in service centers to initiate fast updates of master-file
IDs. Later this year, it will be used to verify IDs on
employers' tax deposits; and ID data from third-party reports
such as Form W-2s will be added. In 1991, the IRS plans to
add more account information from the master files to the
separate OLE files to speed up responses to inquiries.
                                                                                                       

   RED INK TO RED CARPET: An ailing hotel welcomes a New York
state refund.
   A ruling in U.S. Bankruptcy Court bars the state from
applying a 10% real-estate-gains tax to the 1989 sale of New
York City's Stanhope Hotel under court auspices. Judge
Brozman ordered the state to refund a $2.6 million tax that
995 Fifth Avenue Associates paid under protest so that it
could close the $76 million sale to Tobishima Associates of
Japan. The tax hits gains from real-estate sales exceeding $1
million.
   The hotel owners sought Chapter 11 protection from
creditors in 1988 and sold the hotel under a court-approved
plan to pay debts. The gains levy would have to be paid if it
were an income tax. But the judge called it a transfer tax
that can't be imposed in Chapter 11 cases under bankruptcy
law. People selling troubled properties now must consider
whether to go through Chapter 11, says Joshua J. Angel, a
lawyer for the Stanhope's former owners.
   New York officials say they plan to appeal the decision.
                                                                                                       

   NO SHOESTRING STINGS here. A pending illegal-drug bill
would renew through 1991 an expired law that let IRS
undercover operations pay expenses with their sting income
instead of depositing it in the U.S. general fund. The bill
also would make violation of the cash-transaction-reporting
laws a felony instead of a misdemeanor.
                                                                                                       

   IN RE: SAUCES AND GEESE: The Boston Globe supported the
new tax package, including sales taxes on services, to trim
Massachusetts's deficit. Now it is suing to challenge a
section that, it says, makes newspaper publishing the only
manufacturing industry in the state subject to sales tax on
raw materials and machinery.
                                                                                                       

   A HANDWRITTEN NOTE from his sister confirmed Brent D.
Amundson's 50% interest in their home, although his name
wasn't on the mortgage, the Tax Court said. It let the
Sunnyvale, Calif., man deduct his interest payments on the
mortgage.
                                                                                                       

   LIFE-INSURANCE SELLERS may get a break on business-expense
deductions.
   Self-employed people deduct expenses in full on Schedule C
of personal returns, but employees deduct unreimbursed
expenses on Schedule A only to the extent that all
miscellaneous deductions exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.
Then there are "statutory" employees, who report income on
Schedule C as the self-employed do, but fall in between for
tax withholding: Employers withhold Social Security and
unemployment taxes, but not income taxes, on payments to
them.
   The special category includes full-time life-insurance
salespeople and certain people who do piecework at home,
deliver food or laundry, or travel in sales jobs; employers'
Form W-2 pay reports show this status. According to publisher
Research Institute of America, the IRS now says it will treat
statutory employees as self-employed for the purpose of
letting them deduct business expenses in full on Schedule C.
   The IRS is expected to issue a statement to that effect.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: A House Government Operations panel plans a
hearing today on the feasibility of a tax amnesty, which the
IRS and the Treasury have opposed in the past. . . .
Montana's November ballot will list a citizens'
constitutional initiative to abolish all of the state's taxes
and to replace them with a 1% "trade charge" on all business
and financial transactions.
