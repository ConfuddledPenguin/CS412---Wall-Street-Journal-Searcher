   GENEVA -- Rising tension between two leading OPEC members
-- Iraq and Kuwait -- threatened to trigger a new debate on
strategy among oil ministers just as they appeared ready to
agree on production goals aimed at propping up world crude
prices.
   Most of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
ministers on hand for the opening of meetings here today
arrived convinced they can reduce their combined output
sufficiently to boost oil prices until demand picks up later
this year.

   However, the meeting is starting against an unsettling
backdrop. Iraq, which blames Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates for this year's oil-price fall, has reportedly
stationed troops on the Kuwaiti border. That move follows a
vociferous verbal attack on Kuwait last week by Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein, asserting that overproduction by
Kuwait and the UAE have caused Iraq economic damage. Pentagon
officials confirmed that U.S. warships have been put on alert
in the Persian Gulf because of mounting friction there.
   The discord between Iraq and Kuwait was immediately
apparent as their oil ministers here seemed to be far apart
on what OPEC's new pricing and production goals ought to be.
   Kuwait's new oil minister, Rasheed Salem Al-Ameeri,
wouldn't comment, but he has pledged to help increase oil
prices by reducing Kuwait's output to its quota of 1.5
million barrels a day. In return, Kuwait would get a higher
quota when demand picks up for OPEC oil later this year. The
UAE has made a similar pledge after a meeting of the Persian
Gulf producers in Saudi Arabia earlier this month.
   But, delegates here said, Kuwait supports only an increase
in the average price of OPEC oil to the previously targeted
$18 a barrel from the current average of about $16.50.
   By contrast, Issam Abdul Raheem AlChalabi, Iraq's oil
minister, arrived repeating a call for the OPEC benchmark
price to be increased to $25 a barrel. "We are aiming for an
agreement that will make the prices firm up to the level we
have announced," Mr. Al-Chalabi said. Libya's chief delegate
also supported the $25 target, though most others suggested
that currently it was out of reach.
   Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, declined to give a
pricing target except to say that he supports a higher price.
He also was among those predicting that the tensions between
Iraq and Kuwait wouldn't affect disccusions here. "We are
here to solve oil problems," Mr. Nazer said.
   Persian Gulf sources suggested Saudi Arabia might be
willing to accept an OPEC target price of $18 to $20 a
barrel. Iran's minister, and a number of others, want a $20
price.
   The proposal announced two weeks ago in Saudi Arabia
appeared to offer solutions to the price issue. It called for
a slight increase in OPEC's production ceiling, now 22.1
million barrels a day, to 22.4 million or 22.5 million, but
that would be far below recent output levels as high as 24
million.
   The increase in the official ceiling would allow a higher
quota of 1.5 million barrels a day for the UAE, matching that
of Kuwait's. However, both have produced as much as two
million barrels a day earlier this year.
   Delegates from Saudi Arabia said that proposal hasn't been
changed by the Iraq-Kuwait dispute. Others also said they
still expect OPEC production to be cut to under 23 million
barrels a day. They don't agree on whether the new ceiling
should remain in effect for the rest of the year or just for
the remainder of this quarter.
   A report by OPEC's economist to the ministers today will
address that issue. OPEC's meetings begin this afternoon with
a session of its eight-member monitoring committee; the full
conference starts tomorrow. Some delegates said they still
expect this meeting to end within two or three days.
