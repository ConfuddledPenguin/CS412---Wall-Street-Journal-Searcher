   PepsiCo Inc., paced by big earnings gains in its fledgling
overseas markets, said second-quarter net income rose 10%.
   Stripping away several one-time credits and charges,
Pepsi's earnings would have increased 19%, as the company
outperformed the sluggish fast-food industry in the U.S. and
peddled more chips, chicken and soft drinks to consumers
abroad.

   In line with analysts' estimates, Pepsi's second-quarter
net income was $292.5 million, or $1.10 a share, compared
with $264.9 million, or $1 a share.
   The latest quarter's net included a two-cent-a-share write
off of soda and snack receivables, resulting from the recent
bankruptcy-law filing of a major customer, Circle K Corp. The
quarter also included three cents a share in earnings
dilution from Pepsi's acquisition last year of two British
snack companies. The year-ago quarter's net included several
gains and charges, the net effect of which was a credit of
six cents a share.
   Sales for Pepsi, of Purchase, N.Y., totaled $4.2 billion,
up 17% from $3.59 billion.
   In snack foods, Pepsi's biggest profit maker,
second-quarter international sales more than doubled to
$347.7 million while profits jumped 75%. The latest results
include the operations of the big British snack companies.
But even without them, the overseas snack-food business sold
14% more chips, as measured in tons. In the U.S., by
contrast, where the snack-food market is more mature and
competitive, Pepsi's Frito-Lay unit showed a 5% increase in
volume. That gain translated, after higher promotional costs
for new products and some charges, into a 7% profit growth in
the U.S.
   In soft drinks, unlike main rival Coca-Cola Co., most of
Pepsi's profits come from the U.S. And with a 4% increase in
second-quarter sales by the company's domestic bottlers,
compared with about a 3% gain for Coke, Pepsi uncorked a 12%
rise in domestic operating profit, excluding a one-time
charge. Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew led the volume increase
in the U.S.
   The nation's largest restaurant operator continued to
shake off the fast-food doldrums in the second quarter.
Same-store sales for company-owned operations, an important
indicator of restaurant health that compares sales for units
open at least a year, rose 10% at Pizza Hut, 15% at Taco Bell
and 5% at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Putting those gains in
perspective, industry-leader McDonald's Corp.'s company-owned
stores, hurt by industrywide price discounting, last week
reported about a 1% decline in second-quarter same-store
sales.
   A combination of new products, like Hot Wings at Kentucky
Fried Chicken, low-priced items like tacos and burritos at
Taco Bell, and expanded delivery service at Pizza Hut, all
helped Pepsi generate improved operating results from its
restaurants.
   For the first half, Pepsi's net income increased 10% to
$474.4 million, or $1.78 a share, from $430 million, or $1.62
a share. The latest period's net includes the charge for the
Circle K receivables; the year-ago period profit includes the
six-cents-a-share net credit.
   First-half sales rose 20% to $7.88 billion from $6.55
billion.
