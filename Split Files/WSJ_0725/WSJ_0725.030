   Three years ago, expansion-minded executives at Whirlpool
Corp.'s headquarters in Benton Harbor, Mich., summed up the
world on a single sheet of paper. Using the colors of a
traffic light, they graded each area of the globe on
qualities such as business climate and market potential.
   In what was dubbed the "stoplight chart," Brazil and South
America as a whole mostly earned stoplights. Business
climate? Red. Barriers to entry? Red. Financial stability?
Red. And so on.

   Now, Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello's
sweeping, four-month-old anti-inflation and economic-reform
plan has U.S. companies seeing red for other reasons. The
plan, among other things, froze much of the country's money,
replaced the cruzado with the cruzeiro, caused
foreign-exchange translation losses for companies and
triggered a recession.
   Caterpillar Inc., which earned about $100 million last
year in Brazil, now expects a 1990 loss there. Whirlpool's
overall earnings are expected by analysts to plunge at least
30% in the second quarter because of a sharp swing to a loss
at its Brazilian operation; the company declines to comment.
And Aluminum Co. of America says its share of its Brazilian
affiliate's first-half profit skidded 90% to $6 million. Many
companies expect the trouble to persist into 1991.
   "We're wishing we weren't there," says Frederick A.
Krehbiel, chief executive of Molex Inc. The Lisle, Ill.,
maker of electrical connectors has made money in just two of
its eight years in Brazil.
   For manufacturers that thought only banks lost bundles in
Brazil, the economic upheaval illustrates the risks of going
global. Executives often portray international expansion as
the key to growth. But although they rarely expect it to be
easy, the Brazilian surprises show that even the biggest and
most patient global investors can be clobbered by a volatile
local economy and a government desperate to control it. Last
month, when Caterpillar hinted at the extent of its problems
there, its stock promptly lost more than $1 billion of market
value in two days.
   "The risk associated with this kind of operation is that
you've got your money tied up until stability is reached,"
says James F. Swallow, a manufacturing specialist at A.T.
Kearney, a consulting firm.
   In Brazil, U.S. companies are being beset by intermittent
strikes, supply shortages and overnight shifts in demand for
their products. Whirlpool had been accustomed to labor
harmony at its Embraco S.A. affiliate, which makes
refrigerator compressors, but it recently found strikers in
the plant using bullhorns to urge others to join them.
Embraco managers grabbed their own bullhorns and tried to
out-shout the strikers. That strike, and walkouts at two
other Whirlpool affiliates, have now been settled.
   For Tokheim Corp., of Fort Wayne, Ind., sales of its
gasoline pumps made in the Amazon region suddenly evaporated
after the Collor plan was unveiled March 16. Today, orders
are trickling back, but there's a hitch: Customers want
electronic gas pumps, which facilitate changing prices, now
that the government has eased controls. The company had
designed mechanical pumps especially for Brazil. Tokheim is
rushing to produce electronic pumps at the plant later this
year.
   It's easy to understand why U.S. manufacturers have long
eyed Brazil. The country accounts for half of South America
and is bigger than the continental U.S. It has abundant
mineral resources. And with a population of 150 million, more
than double that in 1960, it has an ample labor supply. In
addition, marketers such as Whirlpool, which notes that only
about one in four of Brazilian homes with electricity has a
washing machine, drool over the potential of a growing middle
class.
   Consequently, more and more U.S. companies have been drawn
to Brazil, and many of their operations have grown quite
large. At the end of 1988, U.S. corporations had $11.8
billion invested, representing nearly a third of overall
foreign investment in Brazil. Xerox Corp., with 4,000
employees at three locations in the country, has raised sales
of its office products to some $600 million to $700 million
in Brazil. Caterpillar employs about 5,000 workers in the
country.
   For all their troubles, many U.S. executives still see the
Collor plan as the best chance to curb runaway inflation and
pry open the Western world's eighth-largest economy. Roiled
by hyperinflation, Brazil has had little economic stability
in recent years. U.S. managers have had to spend more time
managing money than manufacturing.
   Last year, for instance, as inflation ran at a 1,765%
annual rate, Molex didn't ship products for the first 10 days
each month; it took that long to haggle over price increases
with customers and suppliers. And in a frantic dance to beat
inflation, the company hired workers to stand in the long
lines at Sao Paulo banks. They would take money given them by
another Molex employee, deposit it and go to the end of the
line to wait for the next transaction.
   For now, the game plans of most U.S. companies are simple:
Stem the bleeding and try to devise a strategy for the
future. That's easier said than done. "Forecasting down here
is absolutely impossible," says Robert Frey, president of
Whirlpool do Brasil. At Molex, managers now must update their
three-year Brazil plan every three months to keep pace with
changes. "I took my dartboard" to develop the latest plan,
jokes James Cummings, whose job at Molex is to stem the red
ink from Brazil.
   The effects of the Collor plan on Autolatina, the giant
auto maker owned by Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, have
been harsh. Near the end of March, its parking lots bulged
with nearly 20,000 unsold vehicles. Soon afterwards, it shut
its plants for five weeks and laid off 28,000 workers.
   When customers resumed buying cars, Autolatina, like
Tokheim, discovered that their tastes had changed. Suddenly,
they shunned luxury and snapped up economy cars such as the
basic version of the Gol, a two-door hatchback. Autolatina
had to scramble to get the parts to meet the shift in demand,
and it took two months to change the model mix, says Miguel
Jorge, vice president for corporate affairs.
   Then, the strikes began. Because the Collor plan abruptly
ended automatic indexing of wages to inflation, unions
demanded wage increases to make up for lost buying power.
Monthlong strikes at Autolatina cost production of 35,000
cars and 2,700 trucks, the company estimates. All but one of
the strikes has ended, but the company says that turned
violent last Friday as workers damaged cars and vandalized
buildings. Companies that avoided walkouts had trouble
getting parts: Their suppliers had been struck.
   At Whirlpool's three Brazilian affiliates, strikes were
settled by relatively modest wage increases -- of about 30%.
But labor peace is hardly guaranteed. "A settlement here may
be good until the next month, when the latest inflation rate
is announced," Mr. Frey says.
   Another challenge is to explain all this to corporate
headquarters back home. When Mr. Cummings is asked the
seemingly innocuous question, "How's business?" he replies:
"Do you want to talk dollars or volume?"
   In dollars, Molex's business in Brazil is down to 60% of
its level before the Collor plan was announced. But unit
volume looks better, at 80% to 85% of the earlier level. The
difference: With inflation at a relatively tame monthly rate
of 10% in June, the company no longer has to charge customers
a huge markup between shipment and payment.
   Even while grappling with disruptions caused by the Collor
plan, foreign manufacturers in Brazil are scrambling to meet
the threat of import competition, which promises to be the
biggest challenge of all. For years, Brazil's strict curbs on
imports and rules requiring that products be made with
Brazilian components protected domestic companies. But as a
result, their factories were very inefficient. Molex found
the quality of some made-in-Brazil components so poor that it
had to inspect every piece of metal and plastic entering its
plant. That improved its products, but the company's
productivity in Brazil was half that of its other foreign
operations.
   Now that the government is lifting such barriers as
outright bans on some imports and quotas on others,
manufacturers have to decide what to make in Brazil and
whether to use Brazilian or foreign-made parts. Last week,
Xerox officials huddled at their Stamford, Conn.,
headquarters to develop a five-year strategy on just that.
Failure to do so could leave the company's Brazilian office
products vulnerable to better-made or less-expensive imports,
says David R. Myerscough, president of Xerox's Americas
Operations.
   With appliance imports permitted for the first time in
years, Whirlpool confronts a similar problem. The company
found, for example, that 15 key refrigerator components are
up to six times more expensive in Brazil than in the U.S.
Even with a hefty import tariff of 60%, that makes imported
appliances attractive.
   Or consider what Whirlpool touts as its "world washer."
David R. Whitwam, its chief executive, says the machine sells
for $500 to $600 in Brazil but would cost just $250 in the
U.S. One reason: The company's engineers in Benton Harbor
spent years designing such gizmos as electronic controls that
fine-tune the spin and timing of wash cycles. But the
local-content rules forced the company to spend twice as much
for Brazil-made controls as it would pay in the U.S. or Far
East.
   Not surprisingly, Whirlpool now is considering importing
components such as electronic instruments or motors from its
suppliers around the world. It also might brave the tariff to
offer Brazilians a luxury item not made by its affiliates in
Brazil: a side-by-side refrigerator-freezer with
through-the-door ice dispenser.
   Like many other companies that have done business in
Brazil for years, Whirlpool says it intends to remain in the
country. But with other options for multinationals opening up
in places such as Eastern Europe and Mexico, Chairman Whitwam
warns: "If Brazil doesn't present stability as well as growth
opportunities, all the companies have alternatives."
   Tokheim, meanwhile, already is chasing business elsewhere:
the Soviet Union. After spending about $4 million in Brazil,
"we're probably not going to put as much money in," says John
E. Overmyer, the chief executive. "In fact, we probably won't
put any money in."
