   BOSTON -- An effort to repeal a new Massachusetts law that
imposes a sales tax on services was stymied despite heavy
lobbying by business and professional groups opposed to the
tax.
   Opponents of the sales tax haven't given up, however.
Lobbyists continue to argue their cases with legislators for
amendments exempting their clients from the tax. Several
groups, including those representing lawyers, newspapers and
accountants, are preparing to challenge the law in court.
Meanwhile, the tax increase could be repealed by an
initiative on the state's November ballot calling for a tax
rollback in the state of Massachusetts.

   "What portends is a long uphill legal battle," warned Jack
McCarthy, president-elect of the Massachusetts Society of
CPAs.
   One of the most ambitious among industrial states, the tax
law, passed two weeks ago, imposes a 5% sales tax on 594
businesses. On the list are accounting, public relations,
architecture and engineering. A few services like advertising
and money management are excluded.
   But last Wednesday, in the Massachusetts House Ways and
Means Committee, a motion was made to discuss a measure to
repeal the law and replace it with a new tax increase
proposal that would have virtually eliminated the sales tax
on services.
   The action was taken to appease legislators who had been
badgered by business interests following passage of the
services tax measure and who, some thought, were stalling
approval of the state's budget as a result. But somewhat
surprisingly, the proposal to repeal the law received only
about half the votes needed for consideration and was, in
effect, killed in the state House.
   Meanwhile, over the weekend, legislators approved an
amendment to the law exempting small businesses with five or
fewer employees from the sales tax on services.
   Critics wonder about the timing of the sales tax
expansion. The economic climate in Massachusetts, hurt by an
anemic real-estate market and troubled banks, isn't cheery.
   A new study by Price Waterhouse on behalf of the American
Legislative Exchange Council found that the state's heavy
hand in levying taxes caused Massachusetts to lose $27.4
million in excise tax revenue and $132.6 million in retail
sales from 1975 to 1988. Almost all the money was rechanneled
to New Hampshire, where taxes are much lower.
   Repercussions from the latest tax increase have also
started. Last week the Boston Globe filed a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of the new tax law as it
affects newspapers.
   In addition, a tax rollback petition on the state's
November ballot, cosponsored by the Massachusetts High
Technology Council and Citizens for Limited Taxation, calls
for the repeal of any tax increases in 1990, among other
things.
