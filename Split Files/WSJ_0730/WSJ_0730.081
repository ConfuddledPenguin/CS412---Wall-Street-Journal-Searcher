   Sharon Steel Corp. said it reached agreement in principle
with Victor Posner, a Miami financier, and companies he
controls calling for those companies to pay Sharon $7.5
million.
   Mr. Posner formerly controlled Sharon Steel, which now is
operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
The agreement is subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the western district of Pennsylvania.

   The agreements will settle all of the disputes and claims
between Sharon Steel, based in Sharon, Pa., and DWG Corp.,
NVF Co., Pennsylvania Engineering Corp. and Mr. Posner, said
F.E. Agnew III, trustee of Sharon Steel. Mr. Posner, who
controls DWG, NVF and Pennsylvania Engineering, couldn't be
reached for comment.
   A trustee appointed to manage Sharon in January 1988 and
his successor, Mr. Agnew, filed a number of suits and claims
against Mr. Posner and companies he controls involving
alleged excess compensation paid to Mr. Posner by Sharon,
alleged use of Sharon's funds for personal use and other
matters.
