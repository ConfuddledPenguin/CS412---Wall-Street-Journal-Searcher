   WASHINGTON -- A Senate subcommittee subpoenaed Robert
Thompson, a former aide to George Bush and Ronald Reagan, to
describe his role in the 1988 sale of 15 insolvent Texas
thrifts, but Mr. Thompson angrily said he won't appear.
   "I am not going to be part of this, what I consider a
circus atmosphere," Mr. Thompson said in an interview in
response to the subpoena from the Senate antitrust
subcommittee, a panel of the Judiciary Committee.

   Mr. Thompson became a lobbyist after working in the early
1980s for Mr. Bush, who was then vice president, and
President Reagan. In 1988, he helped James Fail, an Arizona
insurance executive, buy the insolvent thrifts from the
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. Mr. Thompson wrote
letters to Danny Wall, then the head of FSLIC's parent
agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to facilitate Mr.
Fail's bid for the thrifts. Mr. Fail bought the thrifts and
merged them to form Bluebonnet Savings Bank.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) has alleged that the
government gave Mr. Fail a sweetheart deal and has raised
questions about why the thrifts were sold to him despite the
fact that one of Mr. Fail's insurance companies pleaded
guilty to securities fraud in Alabama in 1976. Sen.
Metzenbaum, the chairman of the subcommittee, hasn't charged
Mr. Fail or Mr. Thompson with any wrongdoing or suggested any
laws were broken.
   Mr. Thompson and his attorney, Stanley Brand, have
questioned the subcommittee's jurisdiction to conduct the
investigation and have complained that subcommittee
investigators have improperly sought confidential financial
records of Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson said he is willing to
testify before other committees that he argues have more
jurisdiction, such as the Senate Banking Committee.
   Meanwhile, a former Reagan budget official acknowledged
that ideology was behind the administration's refusal to hire
more savings-and-loan examiners in the 1980s, when the
industry was deregulated and investing in new ventures.
   Senate Banking Committee Democrats -- some under scrutiny
themselves for their ties to S&amp;Ls -- questioned Constance
Horner, formerly of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, about the wisdom of executing the Reagan policies.
   Ms. Horner, currently undersecretary at the Department of
Health and Human Services, was before the committee as a
nominee to a director's post at the National Cooperative Bank
-- a farm-credit agency unrelated to the S&amp;Ls.
   During her hearing on Friday, the committee repeatedly
pointed out that new S&amp;L examiners weren't hired at a
critical period, even though it wouldn't have cost the
government anything because industry fees pay the examiners'
salaries.
   Ms. Horner said she refused a request for more examiners
by Edwin Gray, former top thrift regulator, because of the
Reagan administration's philosophy. "I think the reason was
that we had a presidential policy to limit expansion within
the size of the federal work force," she told the committee.
   She said that Mr. Gray could have sought a review of her
decision, and added that he hadn't filled current vacant
examiners' jobs. Turnover in those jobs was high, she added,
because of low salaries. "It was, frankly, a rather technical
decision," she said.
   "You had the opportunity to say yes or no, and you said
no," admonished committee chairman Sen. Donald Riegle (D.,
Mich.), himself under scrutiny of the ethics panel for ties
to the S&amp;L industry.
