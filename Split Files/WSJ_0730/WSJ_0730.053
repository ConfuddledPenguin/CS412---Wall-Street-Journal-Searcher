   Chemical Banking Corp. has withdrawn as one of five lead
banks for the proposed $4.38 billion union-led buy-out of
United Airlines parent UAL Corp., according to people
familiar with the buy-out.
   Although Chemical's decision was described as temporary
and subject to change, it represents a potentially serious
blow to the union buy-out group as its attempt to arrange
financing intensifies less than two weeks before an Aug. 9
deadline.

   In an interview, Gerald Greenwald, who would become
United's chairman if the buy-out is completed, said the group
is "close to" agreement to obtain additional debt financing
from some of United's aircraft and engine suppliers. He
wouldn't comment on Chemical's action, but predicted the bank
financing talks "will go all the way to the wire."
   A spokeswoman for Chemical wouldn't comment, saying, "We
don't comment on deals that are in negotiation." But the
decision was confirmed by two people familiar with the
transaction, including one banker.
   At the banks' insistence, the buy-out group has been
trying to obtain additional financing from other investors,
in the form of equity or subordinated debt. To do so, the
group has put the squeeze on United's suppliers, including
aircraft and engine manufacturers and airplane leasing
companies.
   The lack of extra equity investment so far was one of the
reasons for Chemical's decision, according to one person
familiar with the buy-out. One question that made Chemical
executives uncomfortable about participating, the same person
said, was "If this deal goes bad, who do the banks have to
deal with?"
   At the moment, the answer is the banks would have only Mr.
Greenwald and the leaders of United's pilots and machinists
unions, who are leading the attempted purchase, with the
flight attendants and noncontract employees also
participating. The group has also named several outside
directors. But Chemical was hoping for "equity from someone
who is a known quantity," the same person said.
   Chemical's withdrawal from the bank group comes in the
homestretch of negotiations over terms of a proposed bank
financing that would total roughly $4 billion. The other lead
banks are Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp, Chase
Manhattan Corp., and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. Those four
banks also declined to comment.
   On July 7, the union group said all five banks would lead
the effort to place the bank financing, and were expected to
lend about $500 million apiece themselves. But the banks
hadn't signed any formal commitments at that point, nor had
they been paid the usual fee for the use of their names.
   One banker familiar with the bank talks said that
"although Chemical has dropped out temporarily," that won't
scuttle the financing effort. But even if Chemical rejoins,
its action could foster an image of a ragged, bumpy
enterprise that could undermine the confidence of other
potential investors.
   In the interview, Mr. Greenwald said that in recent days,
some of the banks have "moved from very active, to not
active, to quite active" in the talks. He also said in a
statement that the buy-out group "has been working with a
core group of banks to form a capital structure satisfactory
to those banks from a credit and syndication point of view.
There continues to be a number of significant issues to be
resolved."
   One person familiar with the buy-out said the group is
negotiating with Guinness Peat Aviation, an Irish aircraft
leasing company, and General Electric Co.'s General Electric
Capital Corp. about sale-leaseback transactions involving
United aircraft that would reduce the need for bank debt.
Officials of Guinness Peat couldn't be reached, and GE
Capital wouldn't comment.
   Unfortunately, Chemical's decision represents 11th-hour
slippage just when the unions need to demonstrate progress in
order to seek an extension of the Aug. 9 financing deadline
from the UAL board. The airline directors accepted the
$201-a-share union offer in early April only under threat of
a proxy fight at its annual meeting by Coniston Partners,
which holds 11.8% of UAL stock.
   However, the threat to United posed by Coniston has since
eased. Not only has the annual meeting date passed, but
Coniston itself has announced its intention to disband,
citing the difficulty in obtaining financing for takeovers
featuring heavy debt.
   The unions' effort to obtain financing for the buy-out has
been closely watched as a barometer of interest by banks in
making loans for leveraged buy-outs. In October, the unions'
failure to get bank financing for a costlier $6.79 billion
buy-out signaled the end of the 1980s heyday of leveraged
buy-outs. Since then, the market for such bank loans have
been weak, and many big banks have been under pressure to
trim their lending for highly leveraged transactions.
   If the union effort to take over United fails, it would
leave the airline facing potential labor woes because its
major unions are working without contracts negotiated with
UAL management, led by Chairman Stephen Wolf.
   The buy-out group yesterday released the names of two
other outside directors, Cummins Engine Co. Chairman Henry
Schacht, and General Motors Corp. Vice President Shirley
Young.
