   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. -- You can smell the bacon, 10 pounds
of it, cooking at Nonie's Bakery and Luncheonette. Well,
there's Paul Hobbs, the jeweler, stealing a kiss from Brenda
Lively as she slides his muffin and coffee across the
counter. Across Grove Street, Reggie Whiting, the town clerk,
is settling behind her typewriter for another day of deeds,
birth certificates and gossip.
   And down the street, past American Legion Post No. 5,
workers are arriving for the morning shift at the town's
largest employer -- New Hampshire Ball Bearings.

   This is the town you may know as Our Town, the model for
the New England village romanticized in Thornton Wilder's
famous play. But, the way some local folk see it,
Peterborough may be turning into Their Town.
   Among those arriving for work at the ball-bearing plant
today is Shinichiro Ozaki. He's the director of manufacturing
and efficiency expert. He came here after Tokyo-based Minebea
Co. bought the ball-bearing company a few years ago. And more
efficient it has become.
   There no longer are stools or desks on the plant floor,
and, thereby, no temptation to take a break. Walking the
floor are four young Japanese managers, checking on machines
and workers. Production timers catch equipment operating
below capacity. Already, scores of the plant's original 625
workers have been laid off.
   "The company used to be a family, where you felt good
about working hard and where they cared for you," says one
laid-off worker, who along with others had to sign a pledge
to keep quiet as part of his severance agreement. "Now, they
want us to work like animals."
   Today, a Japanese flag often flies above the plant
alongside the stars and stripes, a symbol of happy
coexistence that rankles local residents and doesn't much
reflect the truth of the matter. An ingrained wariness of
outsiders -- of any stripe -- colors attitudes in this small
town of 5,100, often to the point that even positive changes
at the plant are viewed with suspicion. Minebea, for its
part, hasn't helped matters: Unlike many Japanese companies
doing business in the U.S., it tends to be oblivious to the
sensitivities of its new work force.
   "We're not teaching them new ways, we're teaching the
basics," insists Mr. Ozaki. "Twenty years ago U.S.
manufacturing was the best in the world. We're just teaching
now what we learned from you years ago."
   Adds Michael Samide, an American and a longtime veteran of
Rockwell International whom Minebea made president of the
company last year: "Look, I don't really care about the
townspeople -- I have a business to run." Productivity is up
45%, revenues are expected to hit $100 million for this
fiscal year -- up 33% over last year -- and, no, he hasn't
read Our Town, though his wife bought it for him two years
ago. "If the Japanese had read Our Town, they might not have
come here," grumbles Mr. Samide. Townspeople "want to know
everything about everybody. They're busybodies."
   And proud of it. Thornton Wilder's portrait of a town
where a dog can sleep undisturbed in the middle of Main
Street and sharing an ice-cream soda at the drugstore is one
step from a marriage proposal, is, for the most part,
fanciful nostalgia. Basking in the legacy of Our Town,
however, Peterborough boasts an extra measure of curmudgeonly
self-reliance.
   "The biggest thing we've lost in Peterborough is a sense
of control," says town historian Ellen Derby, whose family
department store -- called Derby's -- closed a few years ago
because it couldn't compete with larger chains in nearby
towns. "Our town is not any longer a world unto itself, just
part of a bigger world."
   Paul Hobbs, looking up from his ledger book at Hobbs
Jewelers, recalls, mistily, how he walked down Grove street
on his first day in town. "Some fella tipped his hat and said
`Hello.' Just like that. I said to myself, I've come to the
right place, a real friendly town. But, you know, some folks
still mention that I wasn't born in Peterborough. And I've
been here since 1964."
   Some of the town's fondest memories are reserved for New
Hampshire Ball Bearings, which opened for business in 1946.
Company founder Arthur "Bud" Daniels, a former Navy
commander, contributed heavily to the community, and would
often extend no-interest loans to employees in financial
distress. A generous profit-sharing allotment -- up to eight
weeks pay -- was doled out each July.
   By 1972, New Hampshire Ball Bearings was one of the
country's largest manufacturers of miniature ball bearings,
used mostly in military equipment. Minebea was its biggest
rival, and a potential buyer even then.
   "Takami Takahashi {then Minebea's chairman} was invited
here, and Mr. Daniels took him on a tour and said, `We're
strong, successful and we're here to stay," recalls company
spokesman Jim Abercrombie. "He basically said, `Sell? Over my
dead body.'"
   Mr. Daniels died in 1982.
   Shortly thereafter, Minebea made an offer, and it acquired
the company in 1985. The first few years of foreign ownership
were gentle and gracious -- an effort to somehow blend
Japanese methods with the sleepy rhythms of the town. But the
grace period ended this year with a flurry of firings --
which, in many cases, affected older workers.
   "It's not a case where we weren't doing our jobs, and
doing them well," contends 50-year-old Bill McGinnis, a
quality-control supervisor who was laid off in February after
31 years. "To the Japanese we're just numbers on a budget
sheet. There's a lot of resentment the guys feel toward the
Japanese."
   Nowadays, if you call to the receptionist and ask if this
is the company that was bought by the Japanese, she replies
curtly, "March 5, 1985." That's all.
   Those still on the shop floor are cautious in expressing
their ambivalence. "We're certainly busier than we used to
be," Bob Crowley, a 10-year veteran, yells over a grinder.
"With less people, we've got to work harder. The world's
gotten smaller, more competitive, and we've got to respond.
That doesn't mean we've given up. I'd say Our Town is still
ours."
   "But we don't know what `ours' means anymore," Fred Ells,
a 14-year veteran, shouts from an adjoining machine. Nearby,
a worker asks Mr. Ozaki if he is planning to take a vacation
this summer. "No vacation this year," says Mr. Ozaki as he
strides toward several Japanese managers in an aisle between
machines.
   Mr. Ozaki, 34, and his four resident Japanese managers
live in various stages of isolation -- and none has chosen to
live in Peterborough. Three live together in housing above a
company plant in nearby Jaffrey, and they say they don't get
out much. Tomoyuki Takemura, 26, says he drives through
Peterborough on occasion, but rarely gets out of his car.
Another Japanese manager adds that he is sometimes harassed
by residents, but is working on his English and hopes to
improve his contacts with Americans.
   Mr. Ozaki says cautiously that the company's old style of
manufacturing was comfortable, but eons behind major
competitors in Japan and Sweden. "{They} were like a frog in
a small pond," he says. "They couldn't see the wider ocean.
Which is what we show them."
   It is a show that doesn't play well on Grove Street.
"They're all very profit conscious, more interested in their
plant and what it produces than how it affects the
community," says town selectman Stanley Peters. At the
Peterborough Shoe Store, owner Bob Borsari is in a lather
over the Japanese, and the fact that "America has lost its
way in blind materialism." Just as the diatribe reaches its
peak, and Mr. Borsari is angrily recounting where he was when
Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, Noel LaFortune, longtime manager
of Roy's Market, pokes his head in and asks, "If we have 30
Knights and 20 Masons, how many lobsters do we need?" Soon,
the two are huddling, coming to terms with the great issues
of the upcoming Second Annual Masonic-Knight Cookout, and the
storm has passed.
   James Lenane, a Peterborough town manager, sees a subtext
in all of this. "It's no secret that the whole New England
economy is in bad shape -- there are layoffs everywhere. But
people in this town need someone to blame," he reasons, "so
they blame the Japanese. The Japanese have to make their
money from the plant. They bought it, invested in it -- it's
their right to make a profit."
   Nearby, in a booth at Nonie's Bakery and Luncheonette,
Bill McGinnis, the laidoff quality control supervisor, is
philosophical, and talks about how the town "just keeps on,
no matter what." Soon he's chatting about the famous
graveyard scene at the end of Our Town, in which the souls of
Grover's Corners gather to talk about how the living are so
busy worrying about trivial matters, that they fail to
appreciate life. "I think, because of the play and all,
people got that message strong here," he says. "They
appreciate the small things that give life value."
   "So Bill," Wilder's omniscient Stage Manager might now
ask, "is it Our Town or their town?"
   "Well, the Japanese might just about own this town," he
says, waxing dramatic about the graveyard scene. "But, no,
they'll never own our souls."
