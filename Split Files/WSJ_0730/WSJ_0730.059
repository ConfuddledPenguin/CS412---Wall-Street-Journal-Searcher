   SOWETO, South Africa -- With a giant hammer and sickle
flag looming behind him, Nelson Mandela sought to move his
African National Congress out from the shadow of communism.
   "The ANC is not a communist party," he told 35,000 people
gathered at a rally yesterday celebrating the re-emergence of
the South African Communist Party, or SACP, after 40 years of
being banned. Nor, he added, does the ANC "espouse Marxist
ideology." Nevertheless, Mr. Mandela said his black
liberation movement will continue to fight for the Communist
Party's right to exist and for the right "of any South
African to adhere to Marxist ideology if that is his wish."

   Mr. Mandela's speech was a deft attempt to embrace the
fellowship of the Communist Party while stepping back from
its ideology. Pretoria has long accused the ANC of being
communist puppets, and this week the ANC-Communist Party
alliance was fraught with unease over police allegations of a
communist plot to seize power if the current negotiations
between the ANC and the government fail. President F.W. de
Klerk even asked Mr. Mandela to drop Communist Party chief
Joe Slovo from the ANC's negotiating team.
   But Mr. Mandela said the anti-apartheid alliance, forged
decades ago when both the ANC and the communists were being
hounded into exile by the government, would continue; for
instance, the new SACP leadership committee, which was
announced at the rally, contains eight people who are also
members of the ANC's top decision-making body. At the same
time, though, Mr. Mandela stressed that the organizations
remained independent of each other.
   "The Communist Party is and has been a dependable friend
who has respected our views and independence," he said. It
"has never sought to transform the ANC into a tool and puppet
of the Communist Party."
   Mr. Mandela dismissed the allegations of a communist plot
for armed insurrection as "anti-communist hysteria" and
accused the government of throwing obstacles in the way of
the negotiations, which are scheduled to resume Aug. 6 in
Pretoria. He said, "Comrade Joe Slovo is an old friend."
   Still, the negotiation process, and the liberalization of
South Africa's political debate, has highlighted strains in
the ANC-Communist Party alliance. Since the government lifted
the ban on them and all other opposition parties in February,
both organizations have been working to transform themselves
from liberation movements into political parties. While
holding together the alliance, the ANC and the SACP are also
trying to carve out separate identities and sign up members
from the same pool of supporters.
   While other communist parties around the world are reeling
from a loss of credibility and popularity, South Africa's
version continues to draw wide support, particularly among
blacks. Much of its popularity comes from its alliance with
the ANC, and, ironically, from its image as the most-feared
bogeyman of the whites. "Since we were founded in 1921, we
were {the government's} public enemy No. 1," Mr. Slovo said.
"For the {black} youths and workers, that made us public
friend No. 1."
   Yesterday's rally brought an outpouring of red hammer and
sickle flags and rhetoric of the working-class struggle. "The
politics of the working class are now firmly stamped on the
future of the country," shouted Jay Naidoo, the general
secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
largest black labor federation. Said Cheryl Carolus, a youth
leader and a member of the party's leadership committee:
"Today we can stand up and proudly say, `We are communists.'"
   The collapse of Marxism in Eastern Europe hasn't damped
the South African Communist Party's enthusiasm for socialism.
Mr. Slovo proudly accepts the whites' fear of his party.
"They fear socialism," he said. "They fear us even more than
the devil."
   Mr. Naidoo said socialism is the only way to overcome the
inequities of apartheid, the government's system of racial
segregation. "Apartheid has been proven to be the most brutal
and inhuman form of capitalism the world has ever seen," he
said.
   With the unmasking of the leadership committee, the
government now knows what it is up against. Included among
the 22 members are Chris Hani, the ANC's chief of military
operations, and several top trade unionists. The committee
members have spent a combined 137 years in prison; one of
them, Mac Maharaj, who is also a top ANC leader, was just
arrested last week in connection with the recent police
allegations of a communist plot. Ironically, the Communist
Party leadership received a police escort to yesterday's
rally.
