   Shell said a major factor in the profit decline was a
decision to write off some of the investment in certain oil
and gas properties offshore California because of continuing
delays in securing development permits.
   Shell Oil, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
said the write-offs applying to offshore California and the
Beaufort Sea amounted to $76 million. The benefit of a tax
adjustment applicable to prior years partly offset the
write-offs, the company said.
   The company also attributed the earnings decline to lower
production volumes. Crude oil prices were significantly lower
in the second quarter but slightly improved in the first
half.
