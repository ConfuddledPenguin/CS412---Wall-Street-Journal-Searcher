   Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc., Mount Holly, N.J.,
said its net loss in its first quarter, ended June 30, more
than doubled because of a "sluggish retail environment for
electronics" and high inventories.
   The deficit at the maker of hand-held electronic reference
products widened to $2.8 million, or 42 cents a share, from a
year-earlier loss of $1.2 million, or 21 cents a share. Sales
rose 12% to $12 million from $10.8 million.

   Chairman Morton E. David said the company has reduced
inventories by almost 40% to $17.6 million, compared with a
year earlier. He also said the fiscal first quarter is the
company's slowest period. "Inventories should be in line by
the end of the September quarter," he said, and the company
expects to return to profitability in its second half.
