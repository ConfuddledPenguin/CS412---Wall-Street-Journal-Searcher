   HONG KONG -- Tycoon Li Ka-shing, expanding his overseas
interests, agreed to acquire 50% of the Canadian partnership
that bought the huge junk-bond portfolio of troubled Columbia
Savings &amp; Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Three companies controlled by Mr. Li said they will pay
US$150 million for a half interest in Gordon America L.P., a
limited partnership owned by the Toronto-based merchant bank
Gordon Investment Corp.

   Gordon America has agreed to pay US$3 billion for
Columbia's portfolio of junk bonds and preferred stock.
Gordon Investment is a largely employee-owned bank that
numbers Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and a General
Electric Co. unit among its investors. It has close business
connections with Mr. Li.
   Two of Mr. Li's publicly traded companies will each take a
20% interest in Gordon America. They are the group flagship,
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., a real-estate giant in Hong
Kong, and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., one of the British colony's
major trading houses. A company owned by Mr. Li's family will
hold the remaining 10%.
   Securities analysts in Hong Kong expressed surprise at Mr.
Li's investment, noting that his extraordinarily successful
career has been built largely on real estate, not securities.
But Vincent Mang, a spokesman for the Li group, said: "We've
assessed the risk-and-reward ratio and found them
acceptable."
   The purchase fits in with statements Mr. Li made during an
interview with this newspaper in November, when he expressed
his desire to seek new investments outside the colony, where
almost 90% of his assets were then based.
   The deal, though far afield for the Li empire, isn't
unprecedented. In 1987, the group bought a 43% stake in Husky
Oil Ltd., Canada's largest energy company. The same year, the
Li group took a 5% stake in Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless PLC,
which was sold earlier this month for a profit of HK$700
million (US$89.6 million).
   The 62-year-old Mr. Li, a gutsy deal maker who started out
as a toy salesman in Hong Kong, now controls a vast domain of
container terminals, supermarkets and power plants. His
personal wealth is estimated at more than US$2 billion.
   Building on early successes in real estate, Mr. Li began
swallowing up British-controlled Hong Kong companies in the
late 1970s. His raids on the Jardine group, the oldest of the
colonial strongholds, in particular endeared him to Hong
Kong's ethnic Chinese, who make up the bulk of the
population. At the same time, he enjoyed close ties to
China's leaders and was a frequent guest at state functions
in Beijing.
   Richard Li, managing director of Hutchison's
corporate-fund-management committee and son of the tycoon,
portrayed the US$150 million investment as part of the Li
group's intention to diversify its holdings beyond Hong
Kong's shores. "We look at this investment as a window into
corporate America and into further investment opportunities,"
he said.
   The younger Mr. Li, however, played down the risk for the
two publicly traded Li companies involved, noting that they
have well over US$1 billion in cash, face great potential
profit and stand to lose no more than US$120 million in the
unlikely event that all of the bonds turn sour.
   The Columbia junk-bond portfolio, said to be the largest
collection held by any U.S. savings and loan association, was
valued at US$2.93 billion at March 31, after a plunge that
dumped US$890 million of losses on the thrift, rendering it
insolvent. The younger Mr. Li said the bonds, which include
300 securities issued by 175 companies spanning a wide range
of U.S. industries, bear yields ranging between 14% and 18%.
He said that "by far, the great majority" of the securities
are currently paying their coupons.
   Mr. Li may have been attracted to the stake in Gordon
America because of the favorable terms of its purchase of
Columbia's portfolio, stockbrokers in Hong Kong said,
especially since the U.S junk-bond market may have hit
bottom.
   Under the terms of the transaction, Gordon America agreed
to pay US$3 billion for the investment portfolio, but with
Columbia providing 90% financing on a nonrecourse basis. That
means the partnership can drop the portfolio if its losses
exceed 10%, and Columbia would have to take it back. The loan
carries interest of 10.5% and is secured by the portfolio.
   The sale could help Columbia in the short term, although
many U.S. analysts still believe the savings and loan will be
taken over and dismantled by regulators.
   U.S. regulators and legislators could oppose the sale,
however, because the federal government could ultimately end
up with the portfolio from Columbia if the junk-bond market
deteriorates again.
