   ARLINGTON, Va. -- Allen H. Neuharth, self-proclaimed
"S.O.B.," founder of USA Today and builder of Gannett Co., is
out to establish a new power base as chairman of the Gannett
Foundation. In the process, he is shaking up both the media
giant and the philanthropic foundation.
   In April, Mr. Neuharth stunned his former colleagues by
putting the foundation's 10% interest in Gannett up for sale.
The move by the foundation, long Gannett's largest
shareholder, startled Wall Street and the newspaper industry
by appearing to leave the company wide open to a potential
raider. It also seemed to portend a growing rift between the
flamboyant, outspoken Mr. Neuharth and his frugal and
restrained successor as Gannett Co.'s chief executive
officer, John Curley.

   Although Mr. Neuharth likes to twit his successors and
stir up controversy, he may have brewed more than he
bargained for this time. In his determination to extend the
power and reach of the foundation -- whose sole asset is the
15.9 million Gannett shares, valued at about $562 million,
that he wants to sell -- Mr. Neuharth has come under attack.
   Detractors say he has squandered charitable money on fancy
new offices, paintings, automobiles and unnecessary staff. A
trustee, Carrie Rozelle, has resigned, asserting that she was
"terribly uninformed" about the costs of its new offices.
Gannett executive trustees, among them CEO Curley, also have
resigned, in order to avoid conflicts of interest in the
foundation's sale of Gannett stock.
   Meanwhile, negotiations to sell the stock have temporarily
frozen or slowed the authorization of funds from the
55-year-old institution to programs in communities where
Gannett properties do business.
   There are also indications the foundation may be drifting
away from the causes that relate most directly to the
company's business, a course that others, including the Ford,
W.K. Kellogg and Hearst Foundations, have followed. But as
the Gannett Foundation moves from a company-dominated
institution to an independent one, critics wonder whether Mr.
Neuharth is focusing too much on his own social and political
ambitions and on the fortunes of a small group of cronies who
followed him from Gannett Co. to the foundation.
   Mr. Neuharth dismisses such talk and says his fiduciary
duty to the foundation required his decision to sell the
Gannett stock. While the Internal Revenue Service requires
foundations to pay out money equal to at least 5% of their
assets each year, the foundation's income from Gannett stock
dividends last year amounted to only about 3% of its asset
value -- foretelling an invasion of capital. "Unless we
convert our assets into higher-yield investments, the
foundation corpus will become a corpse," Mr. Neuharth says.
   Whether the foundation's sale will actually put Gannett
Co. into play is a subject of debate. Large blocks of Gannett
stock recently traded the week after it was reported that
Gannett Co. expected to show its first quarterly drop in
earnings in its 22-year history as a publicly held company.
Securities analyst Mary Ann Winter of Brown Brothers Harriman
&amp; Co. says the company is "the most vulnerable" that it has
ever been to takeover or merger. "They've never been in this
position before."
   Other analysts aren't so sure. Under John Curley, they
say, Gannett has become even better run and more
cost-conscious than it was before, under Mr. Neuharth. And in
May, the company adopted takeover defenses that effectively
give shareholders the right to buy a passel of new shares at
half-price if a takeover try occurs. That would work to keep
control out of a raider's grasp.
   Mr. Neuharth says the foundation would like to put the
block of stock in the hands of the company. "I feel a strong,
sentimental tie to the company," he says. "But now is the
time to maximize the value of our assets, so we will talk to
all interested parties."
   Mr. Neuharth says that when he retired he told Mr. Curley,
"I'm leaving you a helluva great company, if you can keep
it." At a May meeting with Gannett Co. executives, Mr.
Neuharth told Mr. Curley, "We at the foundation want you to
keep the company. We think we are offering you the best
insurance policy you could buy for keeping the company
intact. This stock is an even better insurance policy than
any poison pill."
   Says Mr. Curley: "We are continuing to talk to the
foundation, but they are talking to anybody. We are a
potential buyer {of the stock} at any point. We don't know
how long negotiations could go on." Mr. Curley says the
foundation has 2 1/2 years to meet IRS requirements. "It's in
their court and their call," he says of the foundation.
   This isn't the best time to sell newspaper shares. Prices
have slumped. Gannett shares traded as high as $55.25 in 1987
and were at $35.50 when the foundation announced the planned
sale on April 25. The stock closed Friday at $35.25 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts
expect earnings to remain weak in a tough climate for retail
and classified advertising.
   Mr. Neuharth and Charles Overby, a former Gannett editor
and public-relations official whom Mr. Neuharth has installed
as chief executive of the foundation, have big plans. They
say they want to use proceeds from the sale of the stock to
build a big-league, billion-dollar foundation that makes
"high impact" grants. "We want to increase our income so we
do more good, not less," Mr. Neuharth says.
   Created in 1935 by company founder Frank Gannett, the
foundation has championed such causes as a free press,
journalism education and adult literacy -- but without the
global prestige of the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. Its
good works have won it the scorn of conservative watchdog
groups such as Media Research Center, which lambasted it for
donating "heavily to minority activists who lobbied for
liberal policies" in the 1980s.
   In 1986, shortly after Gannett Co. moved its headquarters
from Rochester, N.Y., to the banks of the Potomac, Mr.
Neuharth -- then chairman of both the foundation and the
company -- began pushing to move the foundation as well. By
1989, it was ensconced in a new building nestled in a group
of skyscrapers right across the street from the USA Today
building and Gannett Co. headquarters.
   The nation's capital across the river offers a spectacular
view. Inside the new foundation's office, the view is just as
impressive. The offices' soothing colors -- taupe walls and
fabrics and blond wood -- convey a hint of Miami Beach. The
three floors display art deco figurines by Erte, a beaded
Asian tapestry, "faux" leopard-skin chairs and hammered brass
sinks in marble bathrooms. There is an in-house kitchen for
catered dinners. Mounted in the wall above Mr. Neuharth's
desk are five Sony Trinitrons continuously airing Cable News
and other networks.
   Mr. Neuharth commissioned Barbara Whitney, whom he has
called his "frequent companion," to direct the purchases of
about $1 million worth of art for the foundation. Ms.
Whitney, a Cocoa Beach, Fla., designer and decorator, had
redone the corporate offices a few years ago. The
foundation's outlays for headquarters offices, art, cars and
leased space for the Gannett Center for Media Studies at
Columbia University reached $19.3 million in 1989, up from
only $5.9 million in 1988.
   Mrs. Rozelle, wife of Pete Rozelle, former commissioner of
the National Football League, couldn't stomach the spending.
When she resigned as a trustee in January, she wrote a letter
to Mr. Neuharth protesting that "charitable funds are in your
hands in trust from the public, and they should go directly
to the clients you're trying to serve. Those clients are
generally people in need."
   The approximately $15 million spent on interior design,
decorating and furnishing of the Washington offices,
according to a former Gannett executive, could have been cut
in half if it weren't for Mr. Neuharth's expensive tastes.
But foundation executives defend his style. "These
headquarters in location and design are meant to attract the
best, most creative minds in the country," Mr. Overby says.
He adds, "The visibility of Al is one of our great assets,"
although he acknowledges that Mr. Neuharth "has his share of
critics."
   With all the perquisites and comforts Mr. Neuharth enjoys
at the foundation, they are less than he was accustomed to as
a media mogul. Gone is his $360,000-a-year suite at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, and the limousines he had
available in cities around the land.
   Now, he meets visitors in New York in a modest suite in
the Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South, reserved only for
the nights he is there. He still has limousines, but only in
New York and Washington, and he shares them with other
trustees and guests. When he hits the road this fall to
promote the paperback edition of his "Confessions of an
S.O.B.," his publisher, not the foundation, will pay the
bill.
   The trustees voted Mr. Neuharth a pay increase in 1989 to
$71,467 a year from $48,696. Mr. Overby says Mr. Neuharth is
spending more time on the foundation, although its IRS
information return still lists him as "part-time."
   Mr. Neuharth, at 63, seems comfortable with the
controversy. "I don't like to make trouble, but I'm not the
kind of guy who will stand in line and say please," he says.
Pacing his Park Lane suite in New York, he defends the fancy
digs in Washington. "Are foundation offices supposed to be a
drab place?" he asks, responding in his trademarked sentence
fragments: "No apologies. Proud of it."
   So are some others. Mr. Neuharth doesn't do things
half-way, says Carl T. Rowan, the syndicated political
columnist and former foundation trustee who recently joined
the Gannett Co. board. "The foundation has made grants with
wisdom and passion, which pale, in comparison, to a little
argument over whether the sign on the building is too large
or the chairs are too plush."
   The foundation, a legal entity separate from Gannett Co.,
has worked with the company to direct a steady stream of
money to places where Gannett does business. In 1989 the
foundation spent about half its $30 million in grants for
projects in Gannett Co. communities. But the decision to sell
Gannett stock has put some community grants in limbo. In late
June, the foundation's Mr. Overby told Gannett executives the
foundation was delaying authorization of 1990 grants for its
"Community Priorities Program," grants that have been payable
in Gannett stock.
   These and other community grants create good will for
local Gannett executives and the businesses they run. Grants
last year helped AIDS services and attacks on homelessness,
child abuse and teen-age substance abuse. Gannett's
publishers hope such grants won't be forgotten.
   Mary Parks Stier, president and publisher of Gannett Co.'s
Press-Citizen in Iowa City, Iowa, says the grants "help
people understand the newspaper wants to fix problems in the
community, not just write editorials." In Shreveport, La.,
Leslie Hurst, marketing director at Gannett Co.'s Shreveport
Times, says, "It would hurt badly to lose any foundation
money."
   Says Mr. Neuharth: "Publishers have asked, `Are you
abandoning us?' I tell them no, but add if we don't make this
move {selling the stock} now, we won't be doing anything in
those communities in the future." Mr. Overby says that when
the stock sale is completed, the foundation will make fewer
but larger grants. "A little doesn't go a long way anymore,"
he says. The "$2,500 grants won't be part of the future,
especially if they are designed just to give someone a warm
glow."
