   MILAN -- Montedison S.p.A and Ferruzzi Agricola
Finanziaria S.p.A., two companies controlled by Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A., announced plans to merge into a holding
company, controlling all the agro-industrial and chemical
interests of Italy's Ferruzzi group.
   The company, to be named Montedison S.p.A., will have
annual sales of about 35 trillion lire ($29.5 million).

   As a precondition of the merger, Ferruzzi Agricola will
raise the value of its shares to 1,000 lire from 800 lire.
   The company will also arrange a three-for-seven bonus
issue for all categories of its stock. It will then merge and
incorporate Montedison through a share swap, offering seven
shares of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria for every 10 shares
of Montedison.
   Ferruzzi Agricola said that, thanks to the bonus issue,
the effective share-swap ratio is 10 Ferruzzi Agricola shares
for every 10 Montedison shares. No cash is involved in the
transaction.
   The new company, to be based in Milan, should make it
easier for investors to evaluate Ferruzzi's business and help
it raise money on international markets.
   Ferruzzi said that the deal would benefit Ferruzzi
Agricola shareholders because it would strengthen the
company's assets. For Montedison shareholders, the merger
means the agro-industrial company Erizania S.p.A. will become
part of the enlarged group.

35 trillion lire ($29.60 billion). The dollar equivalent was
misstated in yesterday's edition.
