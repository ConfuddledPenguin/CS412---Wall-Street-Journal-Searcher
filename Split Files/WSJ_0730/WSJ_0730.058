   PARIS -- France's unemployment rate edged up to a
seasonally adjusted 9.4% of the work force in June from 9.3%
in May but was down from the year-earlier level of 9.5%, the
Labor Ministry announced.
   The figures come at a time of growing concern about the
reliability of the ministry's labor statistics. The National
Statistics Institute recently suggested that they
substantially overestimate the jobless rate. Labor Minister
Jean-Pierre Soisson said he plans to launch a study of the
problem to make the data more indicative of underlying
economic trends.
