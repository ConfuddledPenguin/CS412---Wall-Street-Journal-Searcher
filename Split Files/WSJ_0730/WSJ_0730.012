   IRVINE, Calif. -- Western Digital Corp.'s net income more
than doubled in the fourth quarter ended June 30 to $9.5
million, or 32 cents a share, from $4.3 million, or 15 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 21% to $293.9 million from $243.5 million.

   Western Digital said the improved results were spurred by
a large order for disk drives in its storage products
division.
   For the year, net fell 29% to $24.2 million, or 82 cents a
share, from $34.3 million, or $1.18 a share, in fiscal 1989.
Revenue rose 8% to $1.07 billion from $992.1 million.
   Roger W. Johnson, Western Digital chairman, president and
chief executive officer, attributed the year to year drop to
poor first-quarter results. He said results in the quarter
were hurt by hurricane damage to a company plant in Puerto
Rico, as well as a rapid change in graphics technology that
damped sales of the company's graphic boards when
accompanying new monitors were in short supply.
   The company's storage products unit, which represents
about 75% of Western Digital's business, has helped bring
earnings back up. The unit, which manufactures storage
controllers, chips, and disk drives, secured a $38 million
order for intelligent disk drives -- its largest ever for
those drives -- in the fourth quarter.
   Western Digital also reached development agreements with
International Business Machines Corp., Mr. Johnson said.
Terms of the agreements weren't disclosed.
   Separately, Western Digital named Kathryn A. Braun,
formerly senior vice president and general manager of storage
products, executive vice president.
   In her new post, Ms. Braun, 39 years old, will oversee the
company's move toward so-called "interarchitecture" --
designing, developing and marketing complete packages of
storage and microprocessor products.
