   Ministers of 12 Pacific Rim nations gather in Singapore
today to talk about ways of fostering economic cooperation,
in the second meeting of the new Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, founded in Canberra in November. The
gathering serves as a reminder of how greatly Pacific Asia
already has benefited from its increasing integration into
the world economy, and what it now must do to keep up the
pace.
   APEC's member nations make up almost the full roster of
countries that have directly produced what's come to be known
these past 15 years or so as the the Asian economic miracle.
There are the six Asean nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore -- as well as
the U.S., Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and South
Korea. Hong Kong and Taiwan have been excluded so far, due to
the more sordid side of China diplomacy. Their admission to
APEC, along with Communist China's, will be considered at the
current meeting. Add them in, and you have the list of
economies whose achievements just a few years back had many
people looking ahead to "the Pacific Century."

   It no doubt will be on the minds of the ministers today,
however, that the Pacific superstars have hit some rough
patches lately. The region is feeling the chill of China's
retreat last year into another Marxist ice age. The future of
Hong Kong is much in doubt. Just 10 years before the Pacific
Century is supposed to take off, there are places such as
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia that have yet to shake off
restrictions not solely on trade in tangible goods, but on
the political liberties necessary to the free flow of
information and ideas.
   Progress cannot be divided neatly into economic and
political compartments, of course. But they both are part of
a process that, with a bit of institutional encouragement,
tends to fuel itself. Some of Asia's biggest exporters, for
example, have ended up with so much buying power abroad that
their governments have found it simply too difficult and
unpopular to continue keeping imports out. Shop in the
grocery stores of Japan these days and you'll find Swiss
chocolates; Taiwan's reserves have brought its people not
only increased security, but access to such goods as imported
peanut butter.
   Especially in modern economies, information is one of the
most crucial commodities. That's why nations like South
Korean and Taiwan have felt they needed more open
communications and more open politics. Today, for example,
some investors see the charms of Singapore's well-kept port
and industrious people, but hesitate over its politics, in
which Prime Minister Lee does not even trust his own
countrymen to make their own judgments about the contents of
this newspaper. Over time, we'd guess that countries such as
Singapore and Malaysia will find it in their interest to shed
the political restrictions that can only hamper their move
into an increasingly integrated world.
   To keep Asia on track for the Pacific Century will take
leaders clued in to the ways of the modern, deeply
interconnected world. This is where APEC may be able to help.
It was founded with the aim of finding ways for government
institutions to catch up with the private-sector commerce
that is fast outgrowing the niceties of national boundaries.
If the APEC nations can, as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Solomon suggested in an advance press briefing for
the conference, "do as much as we can to keep our markets
open," their economies will prosper, political freedom will
follow, and the Pacific nations can secure their promise for
the coming century.
