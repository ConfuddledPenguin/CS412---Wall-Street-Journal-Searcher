   This is the last time you will read about a No Excuses
jeans spokesmodel in this column. We promise.
   No Excuses, of course, is the company that has gotten
massive amounts of publicity by hiring notorious celebrities
to star in commercials. Last week, Donald Trump companion
Marla Maples, the latest spokes-celebrity, made headlines
when two major networks turned down her No Excuses
commercial.

   The funny thing is, No Excuses hadn't bought any network
ad time in the first place. It couldn't afford to if it
wanted to. The stunt was a textbook case of advertising
flackery, of media manipulation.
   The Maples ploy is old hat to ad types, but here's the
primer for civilians: No Excuses started with an impossibly
puny ad budget, created a controversial commercial that it
couldn't afford to air with any frequency on the major
networks anyway, then used the shock value of the networks'
rejection to get free publicity.
   And the fact is, the stunt worked. New York's Newsday, a
major metropolitan daily, ran a full-color picture of the ad
on its front page. Almost every TV station in the land,
including some that rejected the ad, aired it on the nightly
news. As George Lois, whose Lois/GGK ad agency created the
commercial, says candidly, "If we don't run one commercial,
it still looks like we spent $50 million. How do you buy this
publicity we're talking about?"
   Neil Cole, president of No Excuses maker New Retail
Concepts, agrees. He says No Excuses spends just $500,000 a
year on broadcast time. That's about enough to buy one and a
half 30-second spots on "The Cosby Show." Without the free
publicity, "I would be lost in a jungle of TV advertising,"
he says.
   Mr. Cole says the Maples ad is actually going to air,
although on some inexpensive local and cable stations rather
than network. Even so, with his tiny budget, it won't air
much -- and depending on how much publicity he can milk out
of the trumpeted "network rejections," it may air even less.
   The reason: No Excuses is waiting to buy air time until
this week, he says, so it can assess how much publicity was
attracted. The more publicity, the less air time it will buy,
Mr. Cole explains pragmatically. "We won't have to spend {as
much} money now, and we can make a little more money this
quarter for the shareholders," he says.
   While he readily concedes to publicity-mongering, Mr. Cole
insists the commercial wasn't created just so the networks
could reject it. He knew full well, though, that "if it gets
rejected, we'll do that much better" in the publicity
department.
   And when the rejections did come in, he didn't leave
anything to chance. No Excuses promptly flooded every major
media outlet with news releases proclaiming that all three
networks had turned down the ad. The commercial was deemed
offensive because it stars Ms. Maples telling the world to
clean up the environment -- and she starts by dumping in the
trash the National Enquirer and the Star, two tabloids that
have given her a particularly hard time about "The Donald."
That kind of name-calling is a no-no on network TV. The media
loved the story; the publicity blitz followed.
   But the news release made some people very angry --
especially at ABC, which, contrary to the news release's
claims, never rejected the ad. It never even reviewed it,
since No Excuses hadn't bought any air time. When ABC pressed
the jeans company about its ad-spending plans, the company
provided the network with a letter saying only that it
"intended" to buy time, says Harvey Dzodin, who heads the
network's standards and practices department.
   "We aren't a charity," Mr. Dzodin sniffs. He adds, "To me,
these guys have no excuses for what they've done, other than
knowing they were getting some cheap publicity."
   Mr. Lois, for his part, says he doesn't consider the stunt
manipulative. After all, he reasons, "the media loves it and
are looking for it." Perhaps he has a point.
   Certainly, in these days of ever-shrinking ad budgets,
creating scandalous commercials that will never air -- or
that appear only occasionally on some obscure cable channel
-- is becoming ever more common. "I invented this kind of
stuff," proclaims Mr. Lois, a man not known in the ad
business for modesty. "There are certain accounts where maybe
the budget is half a million dollars, and you want to get
national exposure. So you take advantage of popular culture,
and you feed the gossip mill and the real need for human
beings for gossip about famous people."
   Several ad agencies have made a living out of creating
scandalous commercials almost purely for their publicity
value. One of the veterans, Della Femina McNamee, a few years
back came up with a Lifestyles condom campaign with the tag
line, "I enjoy sex, but I'm not ready to die for it," largely
with publicity and network-rejection-value in mind. It needed
the publicity boost: the client's ad budget was even punier
than that of No Excuses.
   "Many a time I've asked the local network censor for their
approval of a commercial, and I hold my breath hoping they
say no," says Jerry Della Femina, the agency's chairman.
"What if they said yes? What would I do then? I wouldn't have
the money to run it. The networks don't understand that the
way they can kill us is to give us our way."
   There doesn't seem to be any danger of that any time soon,
though, so the publicity piles up for clients who have almost
no ad budget and even less intention of spending it. After
all, the trick works. Among the scores of newspapers and TV
stations dutifully reporting this past May that No Excuses
signed up Marla Maples was, we must admit, The Wall Street
Journal.

   Carl's Jr. Stays at DFM
                                                                                                       

   Carl Karcher Enterprises abruptly halted the review of its
$20 million Carl's Jr. ad account and said the account will
continue to be serviced at Della Femina, McNamee's Los
Angeles office.
   A spokeswoman for the agency, a unit of Eurocom S.A., said
Friday that "the review . . . has been postponed
indefinitely." The move followed the departure of two senior
marketing executives, Bob Wisely and Patricia Rowell, who
were instrumental in reviewing the account.
   The review of the big restaurant account, announced in
June, sparked the interest of nearly every major agency in
Los Angeles.
   The spokeswoman said the firm has begun to look for a new
vice president of marketing. In the meantime, Joseph Olin, a
Della Femina executive who works on the account, has been
enlisted to assist with marketing duties at the firm's
headquarters in Anaheim, Calif.

   PGA BOYCOTT: American Honda Motor and Lincoln-Mercury are
the latest to cancel TV ads scheduled to air during
broadcasts of a golf tournament to be held at an all-white
country club in Alabama, according to the Associated Press.
Those advertisers join IBM, Toyota Motor and Anheuser-Busch,
all of which have changed plans to advertise on the ABC and
ESPN telecasts of the Professional Golfers Association
tournament, scheduled to begin Aug. 9. Officials at Shoal
Creek country club in Birmingham have said the club doesn't
have bylaws discriminating against would-be members based on
race.
