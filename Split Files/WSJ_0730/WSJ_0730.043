   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is skirting dangerously close
to the trap of meddling in Middle East oil politics.
   It's a trap the president could find himself skirting
again and again, as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein takes on a
dual role as Persian Gulf strongman and oil policeman.

   Nine days ago, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent
Scowcroft, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney quietly agreed
to a request from the United Arab Emirates to conduct joint
military exercises with an expanded U.S. force in the Persian
Gulf. The muscle-flexing was largely seen in the West as a
way to show that the U.S. is prepared to defend the UAE and
Kuwait. Iraq had threatened to punish both for exceeding
production quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and thereby driving down oil prices.
   The immediate military tensions seem to have cooled, as
Iraq and Kuwait opened talks over the weekend in Saudi Arabia
to ease the dispute. But the risk the Bush administration
runs is that it will be seen in the Middle East as not simply
having answered a friend's call for help, but rather as
having intervened militarily to encourage overproduction of
oil to drive down prices for the U.S.'s own imports.
   That is a dangerous perception. In the long run, it could
rally all Middle East oil producers behind the conspiracy
theories woven by the region's radicals, most notably Mr.
Hussein of Iraq.
   "A military exercise in a sense confirms -- as it will be
played out in the propaganda of the hawkish states -- what
Saddam Hussein has been saying all along," says G. Henry M.
Schuler, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "And that is that this is all a plot
by the U.S. and Kuwait to lower oil prices."
   Bush administration aides are painfully aware of the
danger of appearing to meddle inside OPEC. So they are busy
trying to damp any such theories.
   "You haven't noticed, nor will you, any statement coming
out of here about internal OPEC policy," says a senior
administration official. "For us the issue is use of force in
the gulf, and it's that simple."
   In fact, the U.S. probably had little choice but to
respond with military movements when asked by the UAE, a tiny
sheikdom all but defenseless compared with Iraq. As the U.S.
was responding, Iraq was moving thousands of troops, hardened
by the Iran-Iraq war, to its disputed border with Kuwait.
   By the middle of last week, Iraq had moved up enough
battle-support units that U.S. intelligence analysts
concluded it was capable not only of striking at Kuwait but
of moving deep inside Saudi Arabia within a week if it chose
to do so.
   This Iraqi brinkmanship brought Mr. Hussein a partial
victory when OPEC agreed at the end of the week to a new
output ceiling to end Kuwaiti and UAE overproduction and
raise the cartel's target price to $21 a barrel from $18. But
that won't end the Iraqi challenge. U.S. officials calculate
that Mr. Hussein's goals are a $25-a-barrel target price,
$2.4 billion in payments from Kuwait for a disputed oil field
on their border and a new role for himself as OPEC enforcer.
   All this represents a troubling long-term trend for the
U.S., which has long counted on cooler heads among Saudi
Arabia's ruling family to be the key arbiters of OPEC
policies. Though the Saudis share Iraq's concern about
overproduction and desire for higher prices, they have always
argued for gentle and predictable increases in oil prices to
keep the world economy in good shape and prevent a switch to
alternative energy sources.
   There is little reason to think that Mr. Hussein, pressed
to pay off multibillion-dollar debts from the Iran-Iraq war,
holds such a moderate, long-term view.
   Moreover, the rise in his hawkish influence comes at a bad
time for the U.S. The Bush administration and congressional
budget negotiators are increasingly drawn to some kind of
energy-based tax to cut the federal deficit. Yet Iraq's
assertiveness seems to assure that there will be some
energy-price increase in coming months, which would compound
the economic impact of an energy tax.
   Against that backdrop, a temptation in the U.S. to try to
influence oil politics may grow despite the inherent risks. A
better option, some suggest, is for the U.S. to redouble its
efforts to build rapport with Mr. Hussein despite his
bluster. "It behooves the U.S. not to isolate Iraq, not to
allow it to become the lone warrior out there," says
Christine Helms, a Middle East analyst and expert on Iraq.
"Isolation produces radicalism."
   Yet selling such a policy is increasingly difficult, as
Congress clamors to cut U.S. links to Baghdad and
administration aides see Mr. Hussein's recent threats as just
one more mark in the growing ledger of his troubling actions.
