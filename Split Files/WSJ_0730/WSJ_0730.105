   SEATTLE -- A little more than halfway through the Goodwill
Games, Ted Turner's self-styled Olympiad is earning low
television ratings but high marks as a world-class sporting
event.
   Before the games opened here 10 days ago, executives of
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and some of its directors
said the goal of this year's Goodwill Games was twofold: to
narrow the $26 million loss the first games suffered in 1986,
and to establish the games as an internationally renowned
event between Olympic Games.

   Based on results through Friday, the second Goodwill Games
appears to have surpassed organizers' expectations for both
losses and fame. Mr. Turner, chairman and chief executive
officer of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting, said last week
that the loss from this year's games would be in the same
range as in 1986. But according to executives close to the
company, his prediction didn't account for so-called
make-goods, the commercial time Turner must give advertisers
to compensate them for reaching a smaller TV audience than
they were promised.
   Including make-goods, these executives say, Turner
Broadcasting's loss from the games is likely to climb to more
than $40 million.
   Through the first week of the 17-day event, the games
scored an average primetime rating of 2.6 -- meaning the
games were watched by 2.6% of the 40 million or so households
that could receive the broadcasts. That's a big improvement
from the games' average ratings four years ago, but it's
still just about half the viewership that Turner Broadcasting
guaranteed to advertisers.
   Executives close to the company said it will cost Turner
Broadcasting about $18 million of air time to make up the
difference.
   A Turner Broadcasting spokeswoman declined to comment
further on the expected loss except to say that the company
won't know the exact amount until the event ends Aug. 5.
   Games organizers do have a lot to crow about in terms of
establishing credibility for the event. The games, especially
the exploits of the U.S. basketball team and track star Carl
Lewis, have received extensive coverage in sports pages
across the U.S., unlike four years ago when the event was
widely ignored.
   Seattle is also swarming with foreign journalists, though
cab drivers here lament that the tourists have stayed away.
Eight sports writers from Italy alone are in town for the
event, dispatching reports home nightly.
   In Thailand, a banner headline in the Bangkok Post
proclaimed the Goodwill Games "off to a grand start."
