   PEABODY, Mass. -- After six years of unprofitability as it
struggled to improve technology and create a market for
videotelephones, PictureTel Corp. expects to break into the
black this year.
   Norman E. Gaut, president and chairman, said in an
interview, "We should be profitable in the third and fourth
quarters," and may have a small profit for the full year.
That outlook indicates that second-half profit may exceed the
net loss of $1.1 million, or 38 cents a share, in the first
six months.

   Mr. Gaut added that sales for the full year will be $35
million to $40 million, which would double last year's level.
For 1989, PictureTel posted a loss of $4.3 million, or $1.61
a share, on sales of $18.6 million.
   "The marketplace is at the cusp of a major expansion," Mr.
Gaut said. He said that PictureTel foresees doubling revenue
for several more years.
   PictureTel makes videoconferencing systems, which allow
people in one room to talk to and see people in another room
a block, or even a continent, away. The $55,000
videoconference systems include a 27-inch television screen,
a video camera, a remote controller and a codec, which is a
computer that compresses and decodes the video signals so
they can be transmitted over telephone wires connected to
digital telephone switches.
   PictureTel's key technology is its ability to compress the
signals with the codec. Besides selling full systems, it also
sells $30,000 codecs directly to small businesses that
assemble and sell videoconference systems.
   PictureTel, founded by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology researchers, has concentrated on electronically
compressing video images to use less band width on expensive
telephone lines. It can currently provide good quality images
at 112 kilobits a second, which costs as little as $15 an
hour for corporations with leased lines. Five years ago,
comparable quality would have cost $1,000 an hour.
   To a user, the other party is clearly recognizable,
although an animated speaker takes on a fuzzy appearance
because the compression software has trouble depicting
motion. "You wouldn't want to conduct an aerobics class,"
joked Mr. Gaut. On the other hand, motionless product models
-- such as white-board diagrams and overhead projections --
are clearly visible.
   PictureTel already has announced plans to introduce
software that it says will improve the image by 70%.
   Mr. Gaut says that sales are expanding, in part because
long-distance telephone companies have increased greatly the
number of digital lines and switches available. And prices
are getting as low as ordinary voice connections because of
competition among MCI, AT&amp;T and Sprint, he said. The digital
lines are available in the U.S., Japan, the U.K. and France,
but still haven't reached other Western European markets or
most Asian areas.
   Later this year, telephone companies and marketers are
expected to adopt standards that will allow codecs from
different manufacturers to talk to each other. Mr. Gaut
predicted that will broaden the market just as facsimile
machine standards helped the fax business to explode.
   PictureTel said its customer base is expanding rapidly.
Last year it sold 570 units -- more than its entire previous
production -- and this year it expects to sell 800 to 900.
   Customers include Bechtel Corp., which uses the unit for
conferences with engineers in distant offices; Cowen &amp; Co.,
where investment bankers in San Francisco and stock analysts
in Boston discuss market prospects; and Bain &amp; Co., which
connects management consultants in Boston, London and San
Francisco to plan client presentations. The U.S. Air Force,
another customer, requires some contractors to install
systems so procurement officers can hold face-to-face
consultations without flying to the contractors' plants.
   Mr. Gaut predicted that prices will continue to drop.
Within two years, he said, PictureTel will make a smaller
codec that can be installed in $12,000 multimedia
workstations with a video camera on top to create a
high-quality, desktop videophone. He said prices of such
video workstations will drop to the $5,000 level by the mid
1990s. By the second half of the decade, he predicted,
PictureTel will have pushed the technology to the point where
$1,000 home videophones will be practical.
   Mr. Gaut said that although the company will have to raise
additional funds in the next year, it doesn't need funds
immediately. It has $3.5 million in cash, $5 million in bank
lines and $3 million in lease credit lines. He added that if
public markets aren't available when funds are needed, he
believes funds would be available through the venture capital
firms that refinanced the company in 1988 and continue to
hold a substantial stake.
   This year, research and development will amount to about
19% of total revenue, down from 30% last year. Mr. Gaut said
R&amp;D spending will continue to rise, but more slowly than
revenue. "All our financial ratios are fine except for that
one," he said.
