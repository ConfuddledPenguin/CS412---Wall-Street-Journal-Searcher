   MELVILLE, N.Y. -- Chyron Corp., a maker of electronic
graphics equipment, said its fourth-quarter shipments totaled
about $10 million, compared with a projected $14 million.
   The company blamed the shortfall, in part, on production
problems due to "working capital pressures," as well as soft
market conditions.

   The company also said it is continuing to discuss its
financial situation with European American Bank and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. to arrange a restructuring of
bank loans. The company has been in technical default on
certain loans since mid-1989.
