   In your June 28 article you note that Austin, Texas, holds
the Guinness World Record for the largest cake ever created
(90,000 pounds). Yes, Texas did hold the record. But that
record was broken on Oct. 18, 1989, in a small town in
northeast Alabama. Fort Payne, Ala. (population 15,000) is
the current record-holder, with a cake weighing 128,238
pounds. The record was certified by Guinness in March.
   We're proud of our accomplishment, and our small-town
"can-do" spirit.
