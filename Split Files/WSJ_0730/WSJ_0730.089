   WASHINGTON -- The Senate adopted a $54 billion farm bill,
renewing the basic thrust of U.S. agricultural policy for
another five years while plowing new ground in environmental
protection.
   The lawmakers agreed to halt the steady decline in
farm-income supports under the expiring 1985 farm bill, and
to give farmers a somewhat freer hand to grow the crops they
want without losing their eligibility for subsidies. But the
Senate made only a stab at frugality, putting off any
significant reductions in farm spending until budget
negotiators can agree on a package of spending cuts and
taxes.

   The bill was approved 70-21 Friday after Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and
Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the panel's ranking
Republican, prevailed in seven long days of floor
skirmishing, fending off all but a few attempts to alter the
compromise package that they had fashioned in committee. One
notable amendment they couldn't defeat would phase out honey
subsidies for commercial beekeepers over the next four years.
   The House expects to finish work on its version of the
1990 farm bill this week, and after Congress returns from its
August recess, a conference will begin reconciling
differences between the two measures. Bush administration
officials already have threatened a presidential veto unless
substantial cuts are made. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the
Republican leader, warned that $6 billion to $18 billion may
yet have to be slashed from the agriculture budget over the
five-year life of the bill.
   But for now, most senators were inclined to take an upbeat
view. "This is a good, solid, progressive farm bill," said
Sen. Leahy. "It is an environmentally conscious farm bill."
   The legislation would expand the Conservation Reserve
Program to include environmentally sensitive land, and it
would set up a new program of easements to protect wetlands.
Under another new program, the government would pay farmers
as much as $3,500 a year for changing their farming practices
to curb chemical contamination of wells and watercourses.
   The bill also would revamp the so-called swampbuster
program. Farmers would be allowed to drain small wetlands as
long as they restored former wetlands of equal or larger
size. The bill would make it easier to apprehend farmers who
converted wetlands to crop production, while imposing
graduated fines for inadvertent violations of the swampbuster
provision. Currently, farmers can lose all their subsidies
and farm-program benefits -- otherwise known as the drop-dead
penalty -- for tilling wetlands.
   Sen. Leahy also called the bill "a victory for consumers."
It would break the "circle of poison," banning the exporting
of pesticides barred from use by U.S. farmers and the
importing of fruit tainted with these pesticides. In
addition, the legislation would create a special label for
organically produced fruit, vegetables and other crops that
have been certified to meet minimum federal organic
standards.
   The commodity provisions would, among other things, give
farmers the option to plant a variety of crops on 25% of the
acreage they customarily devote to subsidized crops. But in
taking advantage of this flexibility, they would forgo any
subsidies on that land. The objective is to have farmers make
planting decisions in response to market demand, rather than
incentives created by the subsidy programs.
   The bill would freeze target prices for almost all major
crops for the next five years, and it would create marketing
loans for wheat, feed grains and oil-seed crops, including
soybeans and sunflowers. Marketing loans are designed to
prevent the buildup of government-owned surpluses by
promoting exports. In addition, the bill would impose a dairy
floor price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk.
   The milk floor price and marketing loan proposals are
among the innovations in the bill that the administration
strongly opposes from the standpoint of farm policy and cost.
In the light of the budget crisis, the Senate bill has a
"surreal aspect to it," said John Campbell, a senior
Agriculture Department official. "It's business as usual."
   "It's very difficult for the legislative branch to
exercise restraint in an election year," said Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter. Nine of the Senate Agriculture
Committee's 19 members are up for re-election.
   Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) denounced the bill for not
being generous enough. He predicted that insufficient
farm-income supports would "create ghost towns in rural
America" as 500,000 farmers go out of business in the 1990s.
   The bill doesn't include a food stamp and nutrition
section, but Sen. Leahy has promised to add one during the
House-Senate conference. To the administration's
consternation, the House has proposed a $5.5 billion
expansion in food stamp spending.
