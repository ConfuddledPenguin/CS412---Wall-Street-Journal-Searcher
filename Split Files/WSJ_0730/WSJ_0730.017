   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo finally met a higher tax he
didn't like. Last week, he was part of a press conference to
blast the idea of limiting the deductibility of state taxes
on the federal form. This would chiefly affect taxpayers in
the states with the highest local and state taxes. As the
table nearby shows (see related story: "GOP Tax Targets --
State by State" -- WSJ July 30, 1990), New York tops this
list. Gov. Cuomo prefers a rise in federal income tax rates
for the wealthy. "Raise their taxes," he said. "It hurts
nobody." New York Mayor David Dinkins defended deductibility
to keep the federal government "a passive indirect partner
and an unwilling partner to boot" in the city. We can see why
the governor and mayor want taxpayers in other states to
subsidize high-tax states, but maybe we could have a national
referendum on the question.
