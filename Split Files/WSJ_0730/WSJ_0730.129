   CHICAGO -- USX Corp. will pay about $34 million in
penalties and cleanup costs for dumping waste water from its
Gary, Ind., steel mill, under an agreement announced Friday
by federal officials.
   "We believe this consent decree is a major victory for the
much-abused Grand Calumet River," said Ralph R. Bauer, deputy
regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. "We expect this decree to provide a framework for
improvement and cleanup at the USX plant."

   The out-of-court settlement resolves a 1988 lawsuit filed
by the federal government alleging that the Gary mill
exceeded waste-water discharge limits in the river. The
lawsuit also alleged that the company violated the federal
Clean Water Act in other ways between 1983 and 1988.
   "This is a consent decree," said a spokesman for USX's
Gary mill. "There are no admissions to any allegations. The
evidence that we are committed to the environment can be seen
by agreeing to this decree, which calls for spending beyond
what is statutorily required."
