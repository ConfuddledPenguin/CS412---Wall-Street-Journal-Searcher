   GENEVA -- The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, in an unusual display of resolve, reached an
agreement intended to push up world oil prices about 20% this
year.
   Under pressure from their heads of state -- including
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who wanted a 40% jump --
the oil ministers approved a $3 increase to $21 a barrel in
OPEC's "minimum reference price" for a basket of seven
crudes. Iraq was pushing for a $7 rise.

   Effective immediately, the increase is the first in almost
four years from an $18 reference price. The figure isn't a
set selling price; instead, it is a goal OPEC hopes to
achieve in the open market through self-imposed production
controls.
   Right now, the market price of OPEC oil is a bit under the
old reference price, averaging around $17.50 a barrel. It had
fallen as low as $14, or $4 under the old target, earlier
this year.
   Still, said Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, "We
do not foresee that the price will not get to the minimum
level." OPEC has seen its average price hit or exceed its
target at times in the past, but has been unable to keep it
there because quota "cheating" by some members created excess
supply.
   This time the ministers believe that price-eroding excess
production won't occur. They agreed here, as expected, to
raise OPEC's production ceiling by 400,000 barrels a day to
22.5 million. While higher, the new ceiling, if realized and
sustained, would represent a cut in the actual amount of OPEC
oil entering the market. The ceiling was raised to allow a
bigger production quota for the United Arab Emirates, which
until now has been a chronic over-producer. In return, the
UAE has said it will honor its new quota as part of the
group's bid to push prices to $21.
   Thus, OPEC hopes to underwrite its reference-price
increase of $3 a barrel by taking as much as 700,000 barrels
a day out of glutted world oil markets.
   The cuts would come from Kuwait, another of OPEC's leading
over-producers, as well as from the UAE. The two were chief
targets of Iraq's President Hussein, who blamed them for this
year's oil-price fall and threatened to use military force to
stop their quota "cheating." Only a week ago, on the eve of
OPEC's meeting, President Hussein moved troops and tanks to
the 100-mile border Iraq shares with Kuwait.
   Formerly known for aggressiveness in OPEC affairs, Kuwait
was noticeably conciliatory at the meeting here and is
understood to be cutting output. The UAE also is arranging to
reduce production to its new quota of 1.5 million barrels a
day from two million barrels.
   Many considered the session here crucial for OPEC and
several suggested OPEC is on a new course. "This is the
turning point," Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, said in
an interview during the weekend. "The credibility of OPEC is
on the threshold of being restored." Ministers cited a new
arrangement to monitor quota violations and a mechanism
intended to adjust prices and production in tandem in future
six-month periods.
   This was also OPEC's shortest regular conference in six
years. The 13 ministers took only three days of informal and
formal talks to settle on a new price target, output ceiling
and a formula linking future price and production changes.
The new reference price and output ceiling are in effect
until year end.
   Most delegates maintained that their focus here was on the
economics of oil, not politics. Some privately complained
about Iraq's "gunboat diplomacy" with Kuwait and the UAE, but
the majority seemed convinced that President Hussein had made
an offer they couldn't refuse. "He was the catalyst in this
agreement," said one senior OPEC source.
   While Iraq appears to have succeeded in getting pledges of
quota compliance, it didn't get the much-higher reference
price it wanted. Only Libya openly supported Iraq's bid for
$25 a barrel. A majority, including Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela, considered that unrealistic and favored $20.
Nigeria suggested $22.
   Iraq regards the final $21 figure, "a step forward in
improving the prices," its oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem
Al-Chalabi, said in an interview. "This was, in fact,
engineered by Saudi Arabia and Iraq with consultation with
others," he said.
   Iran initially proposed a $20 reference price, and for
weeks before this meeting, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil
minister, promoted that idea in visits to other OPEC
countries. "I felt the market would accept" a $2 rise in oil
prices, he said in an interview. From now on, OPEC hopes to
make that judgment process routine by linking any future
increases in its production ceiling with increases in its
reference price. The aim is to assure progressive, gradual
rises in prices. "We don't want price shocks," he said.
   Besides Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia played a leading role
in the new agreement. The new output ceiling and some other
matters were worked out as long ago as July 10 at a meeting
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, attended by Mr. Nazer and the oil
ministers of Kuwait, the UAE, Iraq and Qatar. It was followed
by a telephone call from Saudi King Fahd to the ruler of the
UAE, which then announced it would accept a new OPEC quota.
On Friday, Mr. Nazer listed as among the agreement's "very
important elements" the fact that it is "based on the full
political commitment at the highest level by member
countries."
