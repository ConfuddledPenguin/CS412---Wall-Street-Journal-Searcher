   TRINIDAD'S LEADER OFFERED to resign if rebels agree to
free him.
   Prime Minister Robinson, taken captive Friday in a coup
attempt, promised to step down and call early elections if
his Moslem captors release him and about 30 other hostages.
At least 27 people reportedly have died in the violence that
erupted after several hundred insurgents with automatic
weapons seized control of broadcast buildings and the
Parliament. Robinson apparently made his offer as he and
other officials remained wired to what the rebels said were
explosives. Coup leader Abu Bakr, a former policeman in his
mid-40s, said the coup was intended to stop "poverty and the
destruction" of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation with
high unemployment.
