   A California judge declared a mistrial in the second
McMartin Preschool child-molestation trial when jurors became
deadlocked after deliberating three weeks in the case of
former teacher Raymond Buckey.
   Shortly after Judge Stanley Weisberg's decision, Ira
Reiner, Los Angeles district attorney, said he would not try
Mr. Buckey a third time. Jurors later said they were leaning
toward acquittal on six of the eight counts against him.

   "The McMartin case is over," said Deputy District Attorney
Joseph Martinez at a news conference.
   It was the end of a controversial case that began in
Manhattan Beach, Calif., in August 1983 and resulted in the
longest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history. Mr.
Buckey spent nearly five years in prison.
   "No one has won in the McMartin case," Mr. Buckey told
reporters. "Now I would like to be just left alone. . . .
This is not the kind of life I would have planned out."
   Hours before Judge Weisberg stopped the trial, the jury
asked him to allow them to review the only two verdicts they
had so far submitted. The two verdicts had not been made
public. The judge granted their request and only minutes
later jurors announced their impasse.
   In interviews with reporters the jurors said the two
sealed verdicts had initially been unanimous votes for
acquittal. On only one count was there a majority vote for a
guilty verdict.
   Mr. Buckey's ordeal began seven years ago when a woman,
now deceased, told local police she believed her son had been
molested at the Virginia McMartin Preschool.
   In January, after a 28-month trial and three months of
deliberations, another jury acquitted Mr. Buckey, 32, and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 out of 65 counts of
child molestation.
   The acquittals provoked a wave of protest among parents of
the allegedly molested children and victims rights groups. In
February, Mr. Reiner, at the time a Democratic candidate for
state attorney general, announced he would retry Mr. Buckey
on eight of the deadlocked counts.
   Those charges involved three girls, now teen-agers, who
attended the preschool between 1979 and 1983. Defense
attorney Danny Davis called the move for a retrial "banal
stupidity" and accused the district attorney of using the
case for political purposes.
   According to the Los Angeles County auditor, from August
1983 through May 1990, the case cost California taxpayers
almost $14 million.
   Mr. Buckey has never deviated from his claims of
innocence.
