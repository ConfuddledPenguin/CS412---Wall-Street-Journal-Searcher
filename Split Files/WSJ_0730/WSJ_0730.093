   LIMA, Peru -- President Alberto Fujimori confirmed
yesterday that he had removed the heads of the navy and air
force his first day in office but said he owed no explanation
for the action.
   He also said he would close banks today and tomorrow to
help prepare emergency economic measures but guaranteed
Peruvians' savings accounts wouldn't be touched. In addition,
the president said he wanted to resume payments on the
nation's foreign debt.

   Mr. Fujimori, who took office Saturday, said in his first
news conference that economic measures would be announced
Thursday or Friday.
   Turning to the high-level military firings, Mr. Fujimori

armed forces."
   He removed Gen. German Vucetich as head of the air force
and replaced him with Gen. Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez. He also
appointed Adm. Luis Montes Lecaros to head the navy after
