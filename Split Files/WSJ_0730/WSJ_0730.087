   WASHINGTON -- House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez announced plans to investigate the Treasury
Department's use of government funds for intervening in
currency markets and for funding its Third World debt plan.
   The Texas Democrat said he plans a series of hearings
starting Aug. 14.

   Mr. Gonzalez, in a statement, said, "The American people
have the right to know how their hard-earned tax dollars are
being spent . . . yet the Treasury and the Federal Reserve
apparently believe that Congress and the American taxpayer do
not have the right to question certain aspects of their
international activities." He said this "intolerable attitude
toward accountability to the American people cannot be
justified."
   At issue is the $25 billion exchange stabilization fund
that the Treasury uses to intervene in foreign currency
markets. Mr. Gonzalez called it a "slush fund that lacks
public scrutiny." He said his committee will investigate
whether the Treasury Department should be banned from
manipulating the foreign-exchange value of the dollar and
that power be given exclusively to the Federal Reserve.
   In addition, Mr. Gonzalez plans to look into a Treasury
agreement to sell zero-coupon bonds to Mexico at below-market
prices, in effect subsidizing the bonds with taxpayers'
money.
