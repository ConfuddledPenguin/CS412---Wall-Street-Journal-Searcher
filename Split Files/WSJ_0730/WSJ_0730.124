   WESTON, Mass. -- Eastern Enterprises said the
Massachusetts attorney general proposed a settlement with the
company's Boston Gas Co. unit granting the unit about
two-thirds of a requested rate increase.
   The proposed settlement, submitted to the state's
Department of Public Utilities, includes an annual revenue
increase of $19.3 million, Eastern said. The Eastern unit
requested a rate increase of $29.6 million a year in a filing
on March 15.

Utility Sales Inc., Carol Stream, Ill. Terms weren't
