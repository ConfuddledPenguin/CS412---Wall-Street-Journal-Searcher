   William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., tells us the Resolution Trust Corp. will run out of
money sometime this fall, leaving another 600 to 1,000 failed
or failing thrifts still to be resolved. If even the lowest
of the General Accounting Office's estimates of the cost of
the thrift bailout is correct, another $60 billion must be
raised to finish the job.
   Where will the money come from? A portion was originally
budgeted to come from higher insurance premiums paid by
thrifts, as well as the seizure of the capital surplus of the
Federal Home Loan Banks. But as the public knows all too
well, the bulk of the funding will take the form of higher
taxes on current and future generations. Little known to the
public or policy makers, however, there does exist an
alternative funding source within the savings and loan system
itself, a $10 billion treasure trove that belongs to no one
and could be used to reduce the taxpayer burden.

   To understand the source of this potential taxpayer
windfall requires a brief introduction to the arcane origins
and evolution of the savings and loan industry. Building and
loan societies, as they were originally known, originated in
Britain and were copied in the U.S. in the 19th century.
These institutions were created by communities to foster
savings and home ownership at a time when no other source of
home financing was available. Ownership of these "mutual"
institutions rested in the hands of "members," defined in law
as each institution's depositors and borrowers.
   The development of liquid secondary markets in mortgages
and the entry of new players in the mortgage markets over the
past 20 years effectively rendered mutual savings
institutions a relic of the past. Banks, federal credit
agencies and mortgage brokers now provide the vast majority
of mortgage finance to the nation's homeowners.
   To accommodate this new financial reality, Congress and
the thrift regulatory agencies adopted regulations in the
mid-1970s to allow mutual institutions to convert to stock
form. Rather than simply giving the stock to depositors, as
true ownership would require, the conversion regulations
obliged depositors to pay the same fair market value for
stock as the investing public, effectively stripping
depositors of the bulk of their ownership interest. In return
for forfeiture of their ownership rights, depositors were
given the first right to buy stock, followed in line by
community investors and ultimately the general public.
   The regulators probably made the right decision. Giving
stock in coverted S&amp;Ls to depositors would have proven
unworkable. Today's depositors, including a cottage industry
of professional depositors eager to invest in selective
mutual-to-stock conversions, are not responsible for the
accumulation of equity that took place over generations. The
prospect of a stock giveaway would have brought in an even
larger stream of new depositors salivating at the thought of
participating in the windfall.
   The courts have agreed with this conclusion. The New
Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed the ownership rights of
depositors as "only a technical fiction" in 1973; the U.S.
Supreme Court held in 1985 that the interests of depositors
in mutual S&amp;Ls were analogous to those of secured
bondholders, not owners.
   Today, some 2,000 mutual savings institutions, with
aggregate assets of $450 billion, remain. Roughly half are
economically solvent and have value as going concerns. These
survivors are concentrated in the Midwest and Northeast. The
other half succumbed to the same fiasco as the rest of the
nation's S&amp;L industry and are now candidates for seizure by
the deposit insurance regulators at some unknown cost to
taxpayers.
   And here's where the potential windfall lies: Because the
value residing in solvent mutuals does not belong to their
depositors, it accrues by default to the benefit of the
institutions' managements.
   Mutual managers are free to enjoy their good fortune in
any number of ways. They can keep their institutions in their
current form, which keeps the managers well compensated and
insulated from the scrutiny of stockholders; they can convert
to stock form, selling stock to the public and in return
receiving long-term employment contracts and bountiful stock
options; or they can even give away the value of their
franchise to other shareholder-owned institutions at no cost.
   In perhaps the most extreme example of management
prerogatives, the managers of Manhattan Savings Bank elected
this spring to "donate" their institution and its $270
million of equity to Republic New York Corp. in exchange for
management contracts and benefits valued at less than $15
million.
   BB&amp;T Financial Corp., a highly profitable bank holding
company based in North Carolina, has also discovered this pot
of gold. In the past month it has made deals to acquire two
mutual savings and loan associations at no cost at all to
BB&amp;T.
   By the old doctrine of escheat, states and municipalities
may capture unclaimed and dormant bank deposits. Similarly,
policy makers should consider whether this unclaimed value in
the depository sector might be used to reduce the taxpayer
cost of the bailout of the S&amp;L industry. To do so would
require the government to put healthy mutuals up for sale to
the highest bidder, perhaps setting aside a portion of the
proceeds to compensate managers who might be displaced.
   Based on a conservative sales price equal to 75% of
tangible book value for only the healthiest mutuals, I
estimate the total potential proceeds of these sales to be
approximately $10 billion. Further, the elimination of 2,000
savings institutions would reduce the burden of regulatory
oversight and potentially the exposure of the deposit
insurance funds to future problems.
   The losers in the process would be those who heretofore
have benefited from the absence of assignable ownership
interests in mutual savings institutions. Mutual managers
would surely and understandably protest; up until now, they
effectively controlled the accumulated value within the
mutuals they managed, and frequently passed that value on
from generation to generation. Speculators and investors,
including current depositors and a large cadre of
professional depositors, would lose the opportunity to invest
at fair market value in mutuals converting to stock form.
Acquirors that previously paid nothing -- like Republic New
York Corp. -- would now have to pay fair market value.
   In the end, the absence of true ownership interest in
mutual institutions limits the pain of seizure. The
government defrays a substantial portion of the bailout cost,
the burden on the taxpayers is reduced, depositors remain
fully insured, displaced managers are compensated for their
troubles and acquirors have an opportunity to pay a market
value for attractive franchises.
