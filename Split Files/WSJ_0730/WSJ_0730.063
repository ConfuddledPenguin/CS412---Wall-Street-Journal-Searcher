   David Halperin, named president of New York's Commodity
Exchange less than two weeks ago, has the job of turning a
would-be butterfly into a caterpillar, according to some
members of the exchange.
   The butterfly was supposed to come out of the cocoon spun
last August when Arnold Staloff was hired with much fanfare
as president of the Comex. He had been head of new product
development and marketing at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
where he led the development of currency options. The idea
was for Mr. Staloff to produce a string of new contracts that
would reinvigorate an exchange whose volume depends on gold,
silver and copper.

   Mr. Staloff resigned May 1. During his tenure no new
products were listed, though one of his creations, a vehicle
known as a gold participation contract, will be sent next
week to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for
approval. The butterfly's wings were clipped, it is widely
believed in the New York futures community, because Mr.
Staloff was ill-prepared to negotiate the highly political
waters of the Comex.
   Mr. Halperin, who was an executive vice president at the
Comex before Mr. Staloff's appointment, left the exchange to
take a similar position at the New York Mercantile Exchange
shortly after he lost the top job to Mr. Staloff.
   "I only had to fill two shopping bags and walk about 80
feet down the hall," says Mr. Halperin, 47 years old, about
his most recent move from the New York Merc back to the
Comex. But there is, according to some traders, a world of
difference between the busy, expanding Merc and the Comex,
which has barely grown in the past five years.
   Comex prides itself on being the world's largest metal
exchange, but its trading volume in futures and options
increased only 12% from 1985 through 1989. That minuscule
rise includes several periods during which the copper market
was extremely active. During the same five years, the New
York Merc's volume jumped 390%, and trading on all U.S.
futures exchanges increased by 80%.
   Mr. Halperin says he isn't troubled by volume. "A few
weeks ago, people were saying the gold market was dead. Then
we get a little shakeout in the stock market and volume picks
up to 50,000 to 60,000 contracts a day," he notes.
   What is important, he says, is that he expects the Comex
to earn a profit of $6 million to $8 million this year. He
says that trading volume is significantly above the
exchange's break-even point.
   For over a year the Comex and the Merc have held talks
exploring merger of the two exchanges. Mr. Halperin was
closely involved in the talks when he was a vice president at
the Comex and at the Merc, and at both exchanges he was
viewed as a strong advocate of a merger.
   One Merc official asserts Mr. Halperin's return to the
Comex strongly indicates that he believes a merger is
unlikely. But Mr. Halperin says that a merger is no threat to
his job security. "Because of my knowledge of both
institutions it wouldn't be difficult for me to work out my
position in a combined organization," he says.
   One Comex floor trader says he believes the probability of
a successful merger is no more than 50%. Mr. Staloff, the
former Comex president, says regardless who is president, "a
merger will depend upon convincing 25 or 30 influential
members at both exchanges that it is a good idea." He adds
that those people are not necessarily on the exchanges'
boards.
   Mr. Halperin's career has been concerned mostly with
financial, administrative and operational matters. Now he
must try to find new products that will appeal both to floor
traders and the investing public. He says the Comex's board
has recently approved the idea of trading gold contracts with
super-long maturities of as much as five years -- currently,
futures are listed as far out as 23 months -- and he adds the
board is also looking at gold options with only five-day
lives.
   Mr. Staloff says that as long as the metal markets remain
active, the exchange is viable. But, he adds, "I don't know
how any exchange can survive with products in only one area."
He notes that the Philadelphia exchange has thrived by
expanding from a base in stocks into options on stocks and
currencies. But Mr. Staloff cautions that launching new
products is never easy.
   Several members of the Comex say the exchange is entering
a new inward-looking era and that Mr. Halperin is the right
person for the presidency. One floor trader and former Comex
board member notes, "He is a superb administrator and he
won't shake up anything."
   But Mr. Halperin says the Comex will continue to look for
new products, and adds, "I don't view the death of the
Moody's {Investment Service corporate} bond contract and the
low volume of the aluminum contract as failures. The reality
of new products is that only one in 20 succeed. If you can't
deal with the contracts that don't succeed you can't reap the
rewards {of those that do}."
   He cites the perseverance that the New York Merc has had
with its energy contracts as an object lesson for the Comex.
"By not being afraid of failure, they succeeded," he says.
Recalling that the Comex's fortunes used to be tied to rubber
and hides, he observes, "If we had stuck with them we
wouldn't be trading anything today."
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Crude oil prices are expected to remain stable in coming
weeks. The sharp swings both downward and upward are expected
to halt based on the new OPEC accord, which set a total
production quota of 22.5 million barrels until the price for
major OPEC crudes reaches $21 a barrel. Although the former
quota was lower by 400,000 barrels, less oil will actually be
produced if all cartel members adhere to their new
allocations.
   Crude prices will likely edge up in coming months as
winter demand for fuel begins to come into play and
burgeoning global inventories are whittled down. There was
little price reaction to the accord of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries Friday because the agreement
"came out as advertised," says Ted Eck, chief economist for
Amoco Corp. Gasoline prices, however, have climbed in recent
days as supplies of the car fuel in the Northeast tightened.
Analysts and traders say that the number of gasoline cargoes
from Europe have declined as demand for the fuel there picked
up.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Rain forecast for much of the Corn Belt over the weekend
just ended is likely to keep futures prices from mounting any
sustained rallies this week, analysts say. Rumored increases
in demand in the form of export orders may fuel brief
rallies, but they will be more than outweighed by the
prospect for bountiful U.S. supplies of grains and soybeans
at harvest time.
   Soybean futures prices jumped Thursday on rumors that the
Soviet Union would use a portion of the proceeds from planned
diamond sales to increase its imports of soybean meal and
corn. But prices retreated Friday under pressure from the wet
weather forecasts.
   Besides, the Russian diamond sales ought to be viewed as a
longer-term negative for the commodity markets, says Daniel
Markey, president of Agri Analysis, Chicago. "It's a sign of
desperation. If they have to sell diamonds to buy grain at
these prices, how are they going to be able to afford our
grain at higher prices?" Mr. Markey says.
                                                                                                       

   Copper
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices rose last week, particularly Friday. The
September contract closed three cents a pound higher at
$1.2590, and most months rose to new life-of-contract highs.
However, as visible supplies of copper mounted, some analysts
questioned whether the gains can be sustained.
   Technical considerations appeared to outweigh fundamentals
Friday. For example, traders actively bought contracts when
the September contract rose above $1.2450. In the process,
they ignored increases in exchange warehouse supplies and a
report of weak economic growth in the second quarter.
   London Metal Exchange copper stocks Friday rose 17,225
tons to 84,975 tons and Commodity Exchange supplies were up
653 tons to 13,088 tons. The London exchange increase was
about as expected, but over the past three weeks these stocks
have risen 41,000 tons, a significant quantity.
   The U.S. gross national product rose 1.2% in the second
quarter, below expectations and down from a 1.7% rise in the
first quarter. Also a negative for copper demand was that the
GNP increase for 1989 was revised down to 2.5% from 3%.
   The Mineroperu mine strike in Peru, which began Thursday,
is about 50% effective, and a settlement is expected this
week. According to one analyst, "There is generally an
optimistic view of the strike because of the cooperative tone
of the talks."
   If the technical strength in futures continues to prevail,
the analyst says, September futures could rise to as high as
$1.29 a pound, which would be an important resistance level.
