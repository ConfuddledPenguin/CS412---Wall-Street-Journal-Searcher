   WASHINGTON -- John Palmisano is a new sort of bullish
broker. He deals in dirty air.
   During a stint at the Environmental Protection Agency, the
45-year-old Mr. Palmisano, an economist by training, helped
establish rights to pollute the air -- rights that companies
can buy and sell. Where there was demand for these rights, he
decided, there was room for a middleman: himself. Now this
former regulator is hoping for a frenzied market where, he
argues, he can do good by doing well.

   "I'm on a holy mission," Mr. Palmisano says. "If I'm
wrong, I'm doing something bad for the country. If I'm right,
maybe I'm doing something good."
   He has managed to build a business on his grasp of arcane
regulatory changes. His vehicle is AER*X, a trading and
consulting firm here that he founded in 1984 after leaving
the EPA. Although later that year he sold the company to WPL
Holdings Inc. of Madison, Wis., AER*X remains the founder's
province and retains an entrepreneurial spirit. (Ownership of
AER*X -- which has a staff of 12 and had revenue of $1.4
million last year -- is soon to pass to NaTec Resources Inc.,
under an acquisition agreement announced this month.)
   AER*X is bullish because pollution rights, currently a
thin graft on the body of environmental law, would be
suddenly expanded through the landmark clean-air legislation
pending in Congress. Bills before a House-Senate conference
committee would make these rights far more important in
regulating both acid rain and smog.
   The idea is to dangle the promise of profit before
companies that exceed government requirements for pollution
control. The more the company exceeds the requirements, the
more rights it accumulates, rights that others then can
acquire to cover their own emissions. That's where Mr.
Palmisano comes in.
   Although buyers and sellers could probably find one
another, AER*X saves them the trouble. "They've got the
contacts -- they've already got the wheel turning," says
Thomas Zosel, manager of pollution prevention at Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., which has bought rights through
AER*X.
   AER*X declines to disclose the details of individual deals
it has executed. But Joshua Margolis, the company's chief
trader, cites glass-fiber makers in the Los Angeles area as
among the companies that have generated pollution rights by
reducing emissions of the hydrocarbons that contribute to
smog. He says that such a company emitting 1,000 pounds a day
under its permit could reduce its emissions to 650 pounds a
day, thereby creating a credit of 350 pounds a day. Credits
are selling in the range of $500 to $3,000 for the right to
emit one pound a day, he says.
   Even when companies hold onto their rights for allocation
among their own operations, a more common practice so far
than selling rights, AER*X gets business. For it offers
guidance in generating rights and having them certified by
regulators, a complex procedural path.
   Yet for AER*X, as for the regulatory concept on which it
tries to capitalize, the real test lies ahead. NaTec, a
Houston concern specializing in air-pollution controls,
proposes to make AER*X a prominent part of its plan to help
industry deal with regulatory change. Socrates Christopher,
NaTec's chief executive, says AER*X -- of which Mr. Palmisano
remains president -- may even take positions in pollution
rights if the new regulations permit, much as a Big Board
specialist holds stocks.
   Congress is relying on pollution rights to resolve the
nettlesome issue of acid rain. The clean-air legislation
would allocate rights -- in this context termed emission
allowances -- to electric utilities. Allowances for only
about half the utility industry's current emissions of sulfur
dioxide, a pollutant linked to acid rain, would be doled out.
So, overall emissions would have to be sharply reduced.
   But whether any company's store of allowances met its
needs would depend on whether it invests in additional
emission-control equipment, converts to cleaner fuels or
makes other operating changes, as well as whether it faces
growing electricity demand. Doubtless some firms would end up
long in allowances, some short. Thus arises the need for
trades, and a new market for Mr. Palmisano to maneuver in.
   Trading could also get a boost from proposals to reduce
smog. Already in the smoggiest cities, companies expanding
production need to own offsetting pollution rights if the
additional emissions of smog-creating compounds and other
pollutants cross certain quantitative thresholds. The
clean-air legislation, by lowering these thresholds, would
intensify demand for rights, in this case called offset
credits.
   State regulators in Southern California, moreover, are
ahead of Washington. Under rules enacted last month, not only
such large operations as oil refineries but also small ones
-- such as furniture factories, dry cleaners, bakers -- are
more likely to need credits if they want to expand in Los
Angeles and neighboring counties.
   All this portends heady possibilities for Mr. Palmisano.
The changes before Congress follow a clash of ideas that he
joined in the early 1980s as a member of the EPA's regulatory
reform staff. He belonged to a faction at the agency that
thought traditional "command-and-control" regulation, which
specifies smokestack-by-smokestack controls, was failing.
This group argued that plant managers, goaded by
profit-seeking executives, could outdo regulators in finding
ways to curb emissions, and do so at less cost than under
traditional rules.
   Some environmental groups, though not all, agree with that
view. Daniel Dudek, an economist at the Environmental Defense
Fund, even joined Mr. Palmisano in expressing frustration
with the slow pace at which pollution rights were gaining
acceptance. The two wrote an article titled "Emissions
Trading: Why Is This Thoroughbred Hobbled?" Now the hobbles
may be coming off.
   According to an EPA analysis, utilities in Pennsylvania
alone could annually be selling rights valued at $147 million
by the year 2005. Others aren't so sure, given a sudden
expansion in this sort of pollution regulation. Says Robert
Beck, who has been following the clean-air legislation for
Edison Electric Institute, a trade group, "Nobody really
knows what will happen out there."
   One uncertainty is whether companies will hoard pollution
rights, fearing to sell assets they may need later for
expansion. Another is whether the detailed regulations, which
won't be written until the legislation clears Congress, will
prove unwieldy.
   But Mr. Palmisano is holding out hope for a liquid market.
He talks about trading in leases and options on rights as
well as in the rights themselves. Engineering and law firms
are also likely to get a piece of the trading business. If
everything works out, "trading will explode," Mr. Palmisano
says. "There's no doubt about it. I just hope I get my
share."
