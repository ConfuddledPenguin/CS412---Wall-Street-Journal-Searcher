   GALVESTON, Texas -- A new, double-hulled tanker and two
oil-laden barges collided near here, spilling as much as
50,000 gallons of heavy black oil from the barges into
Galveston Bay.
   One of the barges sank, the other was towed to safety.
Both continued to leak, surrounded by oil-containment booms,
the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Liberian-registered tanker
Shinoussa, outbound with almost 10 million gallons of jet
fuel, sustained hull damage and took on water. But the vessel
was able to anchor safely and wasn't adding to the three-mile
slick spreading from the accident scene, the Coast Guard
said.

   No one was injured, the Coast Guard said, adding that it
is investigating the incident, which forced the closing of
the busy Houston Ship Channel, scene of numerous oil spills,
for most of the weekend. Late last night the channel remained
closed.
   The ship, built earlier this year in South Korea, has a
design that will be required by such ships in all U.S. waters
under new oil-spill legislation pending in Congress.
Double-hulled tankers are said to be spill-resistant because
they carry oil in an inner steel compartment separated from
the outside hull.
   The damaged barges were among three containing 2.6 million
gallons of oil being moved into the ship channel by the
tugboat Chandy N. The tug and barges are owned by a St.
Louis-based towing company.
