   NEW YORK -- Defying the skeptics, Ms. magazine -- sans
advertising -- has returned from the dead, but its longevity
is anything but assured.
   The new Ms. emerges today on newsstands and at Waldenbooks
and B. Dalton bookstores nationwide. The premier issue starts
with a bang: a long essay entitled "Sex, Lies &amp; Advertising,"
by Ms. founder Gloria Steinem exploring how women's magazines
shamelessly cater to advertisers. Lang Communications Inc.,
publisher of the feminist magazine, suspended publishing Ms.
in December 1989, after large declines in advertising and
costly attempts by past owners to increase subscribers.

   To compensate for its lack of advertising, the new Ms.
must now survive purely on circulation revenue from newsstand
sales and subscribers. On newsstands, its cover price is now
$4.50 -- up from $2.25. Ms.'s annual subscription rate of $40
a year makes it one of the industry's most expensive
magazines. But readers who act immediately can take an
introductory "founding subscriber" rate of $30. Old Ms.
subscribers will be able to pay $25 a year.
   Foregoing advertising allows Chairman Dale Lang to operate
Ms. on a much smaller budget, since the magazine can do
without expensive direct mail campaigns and has no need for a
salaried sales staff. But industry experts continue to
question whether Ms. will find enough readers at the
expensive subscription rate to survive. Only a handful of
successful magazines, such as Consumer Reports, don't accept
advertising.
   Mr. Lang, an entrepreneur who dabbles in television as
well as publishing, last year promised to relaunch the
magazine without advertising and to let the magazine resume
its more vigorous feminist stance, which it had softened in
recent years. Ms., which was founded in 1972, floundered in
the late 1980s as the feminist movement waned and much of the
editorial content of Ms. was imitated by other women's
magazines. The new Ms. boasts a decidedly more literary air:
Its contents include poems, long essays and photojournalism.
   Helped by heavily discounted subscriptions, Ms. had
reached a circulation of 550,000 by its last issue. A Lang
spokeswoman said the magazine can still cover its costs with
fewer than 100,000 subscribers.
