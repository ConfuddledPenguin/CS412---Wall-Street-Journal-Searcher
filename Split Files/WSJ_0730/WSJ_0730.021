   PARSIPPANY, N.J. -- Armco Inc. said directors declared a
quarterly dividend of 10 cents a common share, conditional
upon approval by noteholders.
   Because of the $85.1 million second-quarter loss it
reported last week, the steel products concern must obtain an
amendment to the indenture covering the 13.5% senior notes
due 1994 before it can pay a dividend on common. The company
has been paying 10 cents a share quarterly, with the most
recent payment June 4.

   Armco proposes to make a tender offer for as much as 30%
of the $164 million of notes outstanding at a price of $1,070
plus accrued interest for each $1,000 principal amount. The
price is based on bids for the notes in over-the-counter
trading last Thursday, the company said.
   Payment and record dates for the dividend will be based on
the date on which consents from noteholders are obtained,
Armco said. If the company can't obtain consents from holders
of a majority of the notes, no dividend will be paid.
   Armco also declared regular quarterly dividends of 52.5
cents a share on $2.10 cumulative convertible Class A
preferred, payable Sept. 28 to shares of record Aug. 31, and
$1.125 a share on $4.50 cumulative convertible preferred,
payable Oct. 1 to stock of record Aug. 31.
