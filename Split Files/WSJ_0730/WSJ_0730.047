   NEW YORK -- Despite the recent thrashing of stocks in the
over-the-counter market, small stocks are doing a better job
than big ones of meeting investors' earnings expectations.
   "For every disaster, you can also find a company that
surprises you on the upside," says Bob Czepiel, portfolio
manager of RCS Emerging Growth Fund in Avon, Conn.

   Consider: second-quarter profits were up 9.3% at 219
smaller companies tracked by Claudia E. Mott, a
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst. And the earnings were
only 5.2% below expectations, she says, in contrast to
previous quarters when they missed forecasts by as much as
12%.
   In another break with the past, fully 29% of the small
companies tracked by Ms. Mott surpassed expectations while
28% disappointed analysts. The companies have an average
market value of $262 million. Usually small companies are
more apt to torpedo expectations than beat them.
   Ms. Mott is one of a number of analysts who are trying to
make sense of the market sell-off that in just two weeks has
wiped out much of the OTC market's gains of the previous two
months. The Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq Industrial
Index, which includes many technology issues, both peaked
July 16 with year-to-date gains of 3.3% and 14%,
respectively. By Friday, however, the Nasdaq Composite Index
was languishing with a loss of 2.7% for the year, and the
Nasdaq Industrial Index was up only 6.5%.
   But even among technology companies, smaller ones held
fewer earnings surprises than large ones, according to Ms.
Mott. Her calculations show that 35% of small technology
concerns she tracks turned in welcome surprises, while 25%
lagged expectations. Companies producing software and
peripheral products showed the most strength.
   Certain small companies will fare better in a slow economy
than large ones, analysts say, particularly those in health
care and medical products, pollution control and business
services. And some portfolio managers are planning to avoid
many technology issues during the typically slow summer
season.
   "My portfolio is as widely diversified as anytime I can
remember," says Jim Oberweis, who has been following small
stocks for 20 years. His Oberweis Emerging Growth Fund saw
nearly 8% of its year-to-date 30% gain erased last week.
"Last week was unpleasant," says Mr. Oberweis. "But it
doesn't affect my investment outlook at all." In addition to
health care companies promising growth rates of 30% a year or
more, Mr. Oberweis says he likes the insurer American
Travellers and Good Guys, a retailer of electronic products.
   The rocky first-quarter reporting period prompted Mr.
Czepiel's fund to limit holdings of high-tech companies to 2%
rather than 3% of assets. "That's just so when you do get
torpedoed, you don't sink quite as fast," Mr. Czepiel
explains. His RCS Emerging Growth Fund, which has a good
track record and typically invests in 40 to 50 stocks, has
trimmed its high-tech holdings to 14 issues from 20 since
May.
   Mr. Czepiel believes many small growth stocks remain
attractive. He says he has found 10 that are trading at no
more than 15 times their estimated earnings for the next four
quarters and that are likely to see revenue and earnings grow
at least 25% annually. Medical technology remains a favored
area for the fund.
   Armed with cash, portfolio managers say they took
advantage of last week's slaughter of the OTC market to buy
some shares. "When we see stocks decline in irrational
anticipation {of poor earnings}, we step up to the plate and
buy some," says Roy McKay, portfolio manager of the Scudder
Development Fund.
   With an eye toward long-term investments, the 105 stocks
in the Scudder fund are held for an average 4.6 years,
according to Mr. McKay. Among his holdings are Cardinal
Distribution, a wholesale distributor of food and drugs;
drugstore operator Arbor Drugs; Medical Care International,
an operator of ambulatory surgical centers; heart valve maker
St. Jude Medical; and restaurant chain Cracker Barrel Old
Country Store. He also likes companies involved in computer
networking and new technologies such as electronic voice
messaging.
   Promising stocks can be found even among the decimated
technology issues, portfolio managers say. "The
well-positioned companies continue to pull away from the
poorly positioned ones," says Larry Bowman, manager of the
top-performing Fidelity Select Computer and Fidelity Select
Technology funds.
   Among the companies he expects to remain strong are
workstation maker Sun Microsystems; Pyramid Technology, a
maker of super minicomputers; disk drive manufacturers
Quantum Systems and Conner Peripherals; software maker Adobe
Systems; Adaptec, a maker of computer data flow systems; and
Rexon, a maker of computer tape drives.
   Like other technology investors, Mr. Bowman says he has
turned to biotechnology companies this summer as he moved
away from computer-related businesses during the typically
slow third quarter. Among biotechnology issues, he favors
Amgen, Biogen, Immunex, Chiron and Cetus.
   Mr. Bowman says he expects biotechnology stocks will
continue to lead the technology group through September. By
October, he predicts, computer stocks should take off again.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Over-the-counter stocks fell Friday to post their eighth
losing session in nine trading days as disappointing earnings
prospects continued to bruise stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.84 to 442.59, ending the
week 2.8% lower than where it began. Volume slipped to 121.8
million shares from 136.1 million shares Thursday as
declining shares reclaimed their lead over advancers, 1,091
to 780.
   Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette, said that traders who accumulated positions while
the market slipped earlier in the week sold stock late Friday
so they could leave for the weekend without owning shares.
   Westmark International plunged 6 3/8 to 31 1/4. The
Seattle maker of patient monitoring devices lowered its 1990
earnings estimates to $2.20 to $2.50 a share, down from
earlier estimates of $2.50 to $2.75 a share, Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said. Analysts at Shearson
Lehman, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Hambrecht &amp; Quist all cut
their earnings estimates after the announcement and lowered
their investment opinions on Westmark, according to
Professional Investor Report.
   Metcalf &amp; Eddy tumbled 5 1/2 to 20 1/2. Harvey J. Goldman,
chief financial officer of the Branchburg, N.J., water and
waste treatment company, attributed the plunge to reductions
in earnings estimates and investment opinions by analysts at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, Professional
Investor Report said. Mr. Goldman said he is comfortable with
revised estimates the company will earn about $1.20 to $1.25
a share in fiscal 1990 ending in October, compared with $1.11
a share in fiscal 1989.
   Class A shares of Oshkosh B'Gosh dropped 3 1/2 to 30. The
Oshkosh, Wis., clothing retailer reported net income for the
second quarter edged up to 34 cents a share from 33 cents a
share and said it expects sales for the second half of 1990
to be relatively flat with a year earlier.
