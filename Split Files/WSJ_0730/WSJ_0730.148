   WASHINGTON -- The economic party's over on the East Coast
and much of the West. But look at the wallflower Midwestern
states. They haven't wilted yet.
   As the nation's long economic expansion in the 1980s
stretched into a bicoastal boom, America's heartland missed
out on some of the greatest merrymaking -- real estate
appreciating at more than 25% a year, government dollars
gushing for big defense contracts. But while the East and
West coasts raked in most of the party favors, the Midwestern
industrial states quietly picked themselves up from the
devastation of the last recession, evolving into more
diverse, resilient economies.

   Now comes the test for the new Rust Belt.
   As the nation edgily eyes the likelihood of a prolonged
economic slowdown or even downturn, will the big industrial
states finally defy economic tradition? Will they escape the
hard fall that prior recessions have guaranteed?
                                                                                                       

   The latest evidence suggests that this time things could
be different indeed. While the U.S. economy has slowed
markedly over the past year and while national manufacturing
employment has declined month after month, the unemployment
rates of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois remain around the
national average -- near full employment by many economists'
standards.
                                                                                                       

   In May the jobless rate in Indiana, which has a big
auto-parts industry, was 5.2% of the civilian work force
while the nation's was 5.3%. Illinois's was 5.4% and Ohio's
5.6%. Only Michigan, center of the battered auto industry,
had a worrisomely high level of unemployment, 7.1% of the
work force, the third worst in the nation.
   By contrast, in the early 1980s state unemployment rates
in the region shot past the nation's by a nearly two
percentage points. Ohio's jobless rate was more than 12.5% in
1982, while the U.S.'s was at 9.7%. Illinois' was 11.3% and
Indiana's 11.9%.
   Or take housing -- widely believed to be in a recession
nationwide but still growing in the Midwest. New residential
construction, measured by square foot of floor space, is down
about 5% in the U.S. from last year, but it's up by about 5%
in the district served by the Chicago Federal Reserve:
   Northern Illinois, Iowa, the lower peninsula of Michigan,
most of Indiana and southern Wisconsin. Nonresidential square
footage is down about 7% nationwide but is up about 14% in
the region.
                                                                                                       

   Even manufacturing, though clearly softer than a few years
ago, isn't as bad off as it could be in the current economic
climate. Booming exports are keeping factories churning.
                                                                                                       

   "We are competing in an international manufacturing
marketplace that we couldn't have competed in successfully a
decade ago," says Michael Bryan, an economist at the
Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. "Ten years ago it was all
manufacturers could have done to get some government relief
from foreign competition; now they seem to be seeking it
out."
   The Midwest's relative health in the face of softness in
the national economy, particularly its manufacturing sector,
in part reflects its new diversity. No matter what happens to
manufacturing, fewer people in the region are tied to it.
   An increasing portion of the population works in health
care, financial services, legal services, data processing and
other service jobs. In the Detroit metropolitan area, the
portion of people working in manufacturing has fallen to 23%
from nearly 35% in 1978, though many of the services are
still dependent on the auto industry.
   In Ohio, the portion of the nonagricultural work force
employed in manufacturing, for example, has dropped from
36.3% in 1970 to 22.8% in 1990. In Youngstown, a heavy
manufacturing center whose closed steel factories and long
unemployment lines were the emblem of devastation in the last
recession, nonmanufacturing employment grew 3.5% in the year
ended in April, which was higher than the gain nationwide.
                                                                                                       

   "It's a lot more diversified, more viable economy than
before," says Theodore Tung, chief economist at Cleveland
National Bank. "That doesn't mean Ohio isn't going to be
affected by national trends, but I would say it's much less
vulnerable to a cyclical downturn than before."
                                                                                                       

   But while the real estate and defense booms largely
bypassed the Midwest, so too may the busts. "For a long time
we complained about not getting our fair share of defense
contracts, but now it's starting to look like it's not that
bad a thing," says David Allardice, an economist at the
Chicago Federal Reserve.
   Mr. Allardice adds: "We're no boom, no bust -- just kind
of Midwestern blase, business as usual. Business is slowing,
without major concern."
