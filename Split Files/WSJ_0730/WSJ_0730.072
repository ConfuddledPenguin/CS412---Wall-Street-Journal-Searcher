   NEW YORK -- Infrastructure.
   The word hardly rolls off the tongue or grabs headlines.
It's far more arresting to warn in big black letters of a
budget or trade deficit than of an infrastructure deficit.
Not so very long ago dictionaries that carried the word
infrastructure at all defined it -- to quote from a 1961
edition of Webster's -- as a term for "permanent bases or
supporting installations for military purposes."

   No longer. Nowadays defined as the physical system behind
such basic services as transportation, waste disposal and
water resources, the word is gaining considerable attention,
at least among economists and policy makers concerned about
the nation's lackluster productivity performance. They call
the condition of the infrastructure America's "third"
deficit, after trade and the budget, and they greatly fear
that this deficit can only worsen, placing an increasing
burden on an economy already struggling to expand in healthy
fashion.
   The link between productivity and investment in a nation's
infrastructure is apparent, among other places, in data
compiled by David A. Aschauer, senior economist of the
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank.
                                                                                                       

   In a recent 20-year period, he notes, the annual growth of
productivity in the U.S. was a dismal 0.6%, compared to 1.8%
in Britain, 2.3% in France, 2.4% in West Germany and 3% in
Japan. Meanwhile, he adds, nonmilitary public investment
averaged only 0.3% of national output in the U.S., against
rates of 1.8% in Britain, 2% in France, 2.5% in West Germany
and 5.1% in Japan.
                                                                                                       

   The Fed economist attributes "as much as 60% of the
productivity slump" in the U.S. to "neglect of our core
infrastructure," by which he means streets and highways, mass
transit, airports, water and sewer systems and electrical and
gas facilities.
   Notwithstanding the apparent link between infrastructure
and productivity, President Bush's budget for fiscal 1991
"suggests that infrastructure is not a priority for this
administration," says Peggy L. Cuciti, a researcher at the
University of Colorado's Center for Public-Private Sector
Cooperation.
   She notes that the budget includes $43.8 billion for
nonmilitary physical capital, or about the same amount,
adjusted for inflation, that was spent in 1979, even though
the economy has grown some 40% since then. The 1991
infrastructure outlay comes to 3.6% of all proposed spending,
she adds, sharply below the 1979 rate of 5.3%.
   Since "the first theme of the president's budget is
investing in our future, one might expect that infrastructure
programs would fare well," Ms. Cuciti remarks, "but they
clearly do not."
                                                                                                       

   It's no help that most infrastructure spending is
undertaken at state and local levels where, as Donald H.
Strazheim, chief economist of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., observes,
"governments are increasingly strapped for funds and awash in
red ink." The combined operating deficit for state and local
governments is running at a record annual rate of about $45
billion and "is likely to get worse before it gets better,"
the economist adds.
                                                                                                       

   In the Bush administration's fiscal 1991 budget, grants to
state and local governments for infrastructure projects
amount to 23% less than in 1979, after adjusting for
inflation. Not suprisingly, state and local officials
"express considerable anger and sarcasm about national
policy," says Alan Alshuler, director of Harvard University's
Center for State and Local Government. As many as 18 states
have raised their gasoline taxes so far this year, he adds,
and "some of the increases were by quite large amounts."
   The deteriorating condition of the U.S. infrastructure is
amply documented. After a recent three-year study, the
National Council on Public Works Improvement concluded that
"if our public works were graded on an academic scale, their
recent performance would earn a scant C."
   The Federal Highway Administration has estimated that 23%
of the nation's 575,000 bridges are structurally deficient
and more than 25% of interstate roadway has deteriorated.
Meanwhile, more than a third of the country's solid-waste
landfills are expected to be exhausted by 1993 and due to
airport congestion airplanes are delayed an average of 2,000
hours daily.
                                                                                                       

   Such developments, it should be added, can complicate
gauging with precision the effect of a neglected
infrastructure on the economy. For example, if poor roads
cause traffic jams and overburdened airports cause arriving
aircraft to be delayed, it's likely that more gasoline will
be consumed and more overtime paid. This will tend, at least
in the short run, to increase the gross national product. But
it hardly represents a desirable economic trend.

   With such measurement difficulties, it's no surprise that
economists disagree over the exact relationship between the
state of the infrastructure and productivity gains. Some
analysts maintain, for instance, that Mr. Aschauer's estimate
is too high and that far less than 60% of the nation's
productivity slowdown can be traced to neglect of the
infrastructure.
   There is, however, wide agreement on the larger issue
that, for a healthy economy as the new decade unfolds, the
infrastructure deserves far greater attention than it has
received of late. Unfortunately, with the budget so deep in
red ink, the likelihood is for continuing neglect.
