   With global oil inventories still at their highest levels
in more than eight years, it may be year end before OPEC
starts getting the $21 a barrel it wants for its crude.
   Even if members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries strictly adhere to their new, self-imposed daily
production limit of 22.5 million barrels, bloated inventories
currently hanging over the oil market won't disappear
quickly. That's because robust consumption that had been
sopping up OPEC's excesses is lagging.

   Petroleum demand world-wide has edged up barely 1% so far
this year; even the thriving economies in Asia that were
thirsty for oil last year have cooled somewhat. And oil usage
in the U.S., one of the world's largest energy consumers, has
declined from 1989 levels by at least 2% so far this year,
according to U.S. Energy Department estimates.
   Global inventories, which by some projections stand at
about 1.5 billion barrels of crude, excluding Eastern bloc
countries, peaked in May and have declined slightly since.
Winter oil demand also will help to whittle stocks down
further later this year.
   "But the situation is still fairly grim," said John
Redpath, analyst for Energy Security Analysis Inc., a firm
that tracks oil stocks world-wide. "Working off those
inventories will be a slow process."
   During the first half of this year, OPEC swamped the
market with crude. By estimates of its own economists, its
producers poured a surplus of 2.7 million barrels of oil into
inventories each day in the second quarter alone. Now OPEC
must wait for the damage it inflicted on the supply and
demand balance to be undone.
   Even Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,
acknowledged that it could take the rest of the year to
restore order. The agreement in Geneva setting a new target
price of $21 a barrel for OPEC crude isn't an instant
panacea, he suggested, but more a springboard for next year's
prices. "The price was deteriorating to such an extent that
it wasn't only hurting us in the short term, but it was
hurting us in the long term, for 1991," he told Dow Jones
International Petroleum Report. "Everything you see here {in
this agreement} is something for the future."
   Burgeoning inventories coupled with the realization that
OPEC overproduction wasn't going to be reined in caused some
oil prices earlier this year to tumble by more than $8 a
barrel. The price for some lower grade Persian Gulf crudes
that are part of OPEC's average even approached single
digits.
   In recent weeks, prices rallied as Iraq openly threatened
military action against Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
if the two chronic OPEC quota violators didn't cut back. But
then buying fervor cooled and by the time the Geneva meeting
ended, the reaction to rhetoric had about fizzled.
   "It was the first time anyone threatened overproducers
with a gun," said William Hermann, chief economist for
Chevron Corp. explaining why prices initially jumped. "But
then reality set in. There's a big overhang of stocks;
there's a lot of oil out there."
   Though some grades of U.S. crude currently exceed $20 a
barrel, most major grades of OPEC crude are still below $17.
   Experts are confident that supply and demand will become
balanced and OPEC's new $21 target will be reached at some
point, however. They note that for the first time in memory
members actually appear ready to adhere to their quotas.
"Iraq as the enforcer has become the key," said Charles
Maxwell, senior energy strategist for C.J. Lawrence. "Prices
aren't any longer an economic calculation so much as a
political-military calculation."
   Iraq needs cash to rebuild its economy, shattered by its
now-ended war against Iran. To refill its coffers, it needs
higher oil prices. So, "tolerance of {overproduction by}
Kuwait and UAE is at an end," said Ted Eck, chief economist
for Amoco Corp.
   While it isn't certain that Iraq's mercurial leader Saddam
Hussein would actually turn his battle-hardened army loose on
former ally Kuwait, he is generating considerable fear among
Persian Gulf powers. Some experts think he intends to sow
political unrest to weaken neighboring governments so as to
establish himself as the undisputed Arab leader of the Middle
East. "Before they used to worry about Khomeini {of Iran}
exporting his revolution," said Lawrence Goldstein, who
follows Mideast oil politics closely for the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation. "Now they've got Hussein."
