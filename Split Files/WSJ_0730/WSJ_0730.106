   President Bush and senior Republican congressmen last week
announced they had agreed on a budget proposal to cap the
amount of state and local income taxes taxpayers can deduct
on their federal tax returns. The plan would cap deductions
at $10,000. If passed and implemented, the plan will have
widely different effects. The increased burden caused by
reducing federal deductions for state and local taxes will be
borne unevenly by the states. The result will be a list of
"winning" and "losing" states with respect to their
residents' tax burdens.
   It is widely taken for granted that most tax deductions
benefit only the wealthy. But approximately 70% of all
itemized deductions benefit the middle-income ranges. Of the
numerous exclusions and deductions, those for pension
contributions, mortgage interest on homes, payments from
employers for medical insurance and care, state and local
income and property taxes, and Social Security benefits
account for more than half the amount going to individuals.
These deductions are popular because they benefit millions of
Americans. With the exception of direct Social Security and
Medicare payments, they provide the biggest middle-class
benefit in the federal budget.

   Reducing or eliminating the current deductibility of state
and local income taxes will have a great impact on citizens
of states that use these two forms of taxation as their major
source of tax revenue. New York, Massachusetts and Maryland,
which bear the greatest per-capita burden of state and local
income taxes, will naturally be the victims of any reduction
in the deductibility of those taxes. (New Jersey citizens
will approach the top of the list after Gov. James Florio's
new tax increases kick in.) Residents of those same states
are already among those that pay the highest total per-capita
federal taxes. Thus New Yorkers, citizens of Massachusetts,
and Marylanders will all feel more strongly the bite of the
tax burden their states impose on them.
   Conversely, the federal tax liability of residents in
states that have no income tax will not change one cent if
the deductibility of state income tax is eliminated.
Currently, seven states -- Florida, Nevada, South Dakota,
Texas, Washington, Wyoming and Alaska -- impose no individual
income tax. Three states -- Connecticut, New Hampshire, and
Tennessee -- impose no levy on earned income, taxing interest
and dividends only. (Connecticut also taxes capital gains.)
Although residents of such states do not gain absolutely,
they do gain relative to those of high income-tax states. The
new disparity might well cause people to "vote with their
feet" and move from high-tax states to lower-tax states. In
this age of computers and faxes, why choose to live in
high-tax states like New York or New Jersey at all?
