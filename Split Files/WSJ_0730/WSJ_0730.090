   CHICAGO -- A fire at a Commonwealth Edison Co. generating
plant knocked out power for about 40,000 customers on the
city's west and southwest side late Saturday night, and the
blackout sparked a rash of looting incidents that lasted
until dawn.
   By yesterday evening, a spokesman for the utility said,
power had been restored to "about half" the affected
customers in the area. Returning service to the remaining
customers may take until Wednesday, he said, although the
work could be completed as early as today.

   Police put extra patrols on the streets and said they
arrested 49 people on looting-related charges after power was
knocked out late Saturday, the Associated Press reported.
According to the AP, three people died in a fire that was
started by candles those people were using to light their
home.
   Commonwealth Edison serves three million customers in
northern Illinois; the spokesman said the problem at the
plant isn't expected to have any significant financial impact
on the company.
