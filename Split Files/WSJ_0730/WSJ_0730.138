   In "NASA's Flyboys Have Grown Old and Fat" (Potomac Watch,
July 13), Paul A. Gigot calls NASA an "arthritic bureaucracy"
that should be reformed, and argues that "space is too
important to leave to NASA." I say that NASA is too important
to our country's enterprise in space to be dismissed with
such glibness and airy distortion of the facts.
   Mr. Gigot slings many arrows, but aims them badly.
Consider the following:

   He says Vice President Dan Quayle and White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu convened a caucus of "space
non-conformists" who allegedly spoke of the need for "new
thinking" at NASA. Who were those nonconformists? Former NASA
officials all: Thomas Paine, a former administrator; Hans
Mark, a former deputy administrator; Bruce Murray, a former
director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Gene Cernan, a
former astronaut. All except Mr. Cernan had considerable
influence on NASA's policy and institutional evolution. Mr.
Paine headed a presidential commission that laid out the
course NASA is taking now on the Space Exploration Initiative
to return to the moon permanently and send humans to explore
Mars. For the first time, with President Bush's blessing,
NASA is planning for events 30 years into the future, when
people will land on Mars. If that's not new thinking, what
is?
   He criticizes NASA's "gold-plated giantism," an echo of
the criticism being leveled at big science projects. In the
early days of the space program, there was so little we knew
and so much to be learned about space that we could send up
small, simple satellites and reap a bounty of knowledge. But
after more than three decades, we've pretty much solved the
easy problems. The difficult ones remain. And they require
more weight, more time and more money.
   Mature science requires expertise. Mr. Gigot discusses
NASA's aging work force, but fails to mention that NASA is
taking steps to infuse younger people into middle management
and above. Is he suggesting it scrap the experience and skill
of many who not only got us to the Moon, but also designed
and guided our spacecraft through the solar system and
beyond?
   The article states that NASA designed the space shuttle to
"have its own space-launch monopoly . . . and won't even
consider space-launch alternatives." Not true. NASA never
conceived of the shuttle as its space-launch monopoly. The
truth is, NASA would have a mixed fleet of shuttles and
expendable rockets today had not President Reagan taken NASA
out of the expendable-launch business to encourage a
commercial space-launch industry. What's more, NASA is now
working to develop an Advanced Launch System to provide a
heavy-lift capability for the Space Exploration Initiative
and other projects.
   Mr. Gigot implies that if the Bush administration doesn't
reform NASA (he fails to state how) or kill it, the nation
will be faced with no future in space. This is balderdash.
Rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, we need
to provide nourishment in the form of a stable and
predictable budget so that growth and maturation can
continue.

   There are too many NASA-bashers jumping in for their share
of self-gratification at the expense of a very competent
agency suffering a few setbacks. NASA has accomplished 10
consecutive near-perfect Space Shuttle missions since
September 1989, including the deployment and retrieval of
complex payloads such as Galileo, the Long Duration Exposure
Facility, numerous national security payloads and other
scientific and technical experiments. The Voyager spacecraft
gave us up-close views of other planets.
   The Hubble Telescope and the shuttle problems are
solvable. NASA has mechanisms in place to fix the problems.
One of its hallmarks is that it rises to any challenge and
overcomes it. And by the way, those "old and fat" engineers
could be making three times their salaries in private
industry; instead, they've dedicated themselves to federal
service. That dedication has continued to push the U.S. to
the forefront of aerospace technology and world leadership in
space.
   If NASA is becoming too bureaucratic, it is because
Congress, the Office of Management and Budget and the media
have scrutinized, criticized and threatened the agency at
every turn. NASA officials have taken the initiative to keep
Congress, the OMB and the public informed about its current
problems. They should be applauded, not chastised for it.
They are willing to admit publicly when there is a problem,
and they dig in to solve it. The people of NASA do not
deserve the cheap shots Mr. Gigot aimed at them.

   Mr. Gigot's conclusions about the fundamental problem
underlying the huge cost overruns and bungled projects at
NASA are right on the mark. Socialism, especially on a
national scale, works no better in the U.S. than it does in
Eastern Europe. However, it's not true that "Congress can't
see much beyond {NASA's} budget" to true reform. In June
1989, Rep. Ron Packard of California introduced the Space
Transportation Services Purchase Act, which now has more than
40 House co-sponsors of widely varying ideological
persuasion. A version of this bill recently was attached to
this year's NASA authorization bill. The intent of the bill
is to break up NASA's space-transportation monopoly, creating
a true space-transportation industry that will have the
incentive and freedom to lower costs. Lower launch costs are
essential to the creation of an economically viable space
industry and a real space frontier.
   Bruce Murray is correct in pointing out that NASA's
charter does not include the operation and ownership of a
space-launch monopoly. It is rather to conduct space-science
research and exploration, analogous to the activities of
explorers such as Lewis and Clark and the mission of the U.S.
Geological Survey. Space is as important to the future of
America as the Western frontier was a century ago.
   If Sen. Albert Gore is anything but "putty in NASA's
hands" he should take the first step toward really reforming
NASA by introducing a Senate version of the Packard bill.
