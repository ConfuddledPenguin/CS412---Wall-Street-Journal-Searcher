   NEW YORK -- A union representing producers, news writers,
engineers and technicians at National Broadcasting Co.
overwhelmingly rejected a four-year contract for the second
time since April.
   A spokesman for the union, the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians, said it hoped to have
further negotiations with NBC, a unit of General Electric Co.
NBC had no immediate comment.

   The vote was 1,290 to 516 to reject NBC's latest offer.
The previous contract expired March 30. No strike vote has
been taken. The union went on a 17-week strike against NBC in
1987. The main issue involves jurisdiction over people hired
by the day rather than on a full-time basis.
