   Big Board Is Said to Be Set to Select

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is set to tap
William H. Donaldson, a founder of the securities firm
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., as its next chairman,
according to people familiar with the exchange.
   The selection of Mr. Donaldson to succeed John J. Phelan
Jr. would cap the exchange's six-month search for a new
chief. Mr. Phelan, for six years the Big Board's chairman and
chief executive officer, will retire at year end. The move
would indicate that the Big Board -- which has been slowly
losing market share to regional and electronic exchanges --
wants a high-profile outsider to lead it through tougher
times.

   Mr. Donaldson's expected appointment would be a blow for
Richard A. Grasso, the exchange's president and chief
operating officer. Mr. Grasso, who has been actively lobbying
to succeed Mr. Phelan, indicated to exchange members recently
that a choice for the chairmanship will be announced soon.
   The selection of Mr. Donaldson could be derailed, of
course. A final decision by the exchange's board is expected
to be made within two weeks. But Big Board insiders say Mr.
Donaldson has emerged as the clear leader, and they would be
stunned if he weren't appointed.
   A spokesman for the Big Board declined to confirm or deny
Mr. Donaldson's expected appointment. He said only that
members of the Big Board's eight-member search committee
"have been diligently and thoughtfully talking to people
throughout the securities industry, as well as key corporate
leaders for their input," and that their work has been
presented to the exchange's board for review.
   The 59-year-old Mr. Donaldson, who now heads Donaldson
Enterprises Inc., a merchant banking and money management
firm, couldn't be reached to comment.
   One of the three founders of the securities firm that
bears his name, Mr. Donaldson left Donaldson Lufkin in 1973
to become U.S. undersecretary of state to Henry Kissinger.
Later, Mr. Donaldson was founder and first dean of Yale
University's School of Organization and Management.
   Mr. Donaldson still has strong ties to top Washington
officials, associates say, including President Bush. He also
serves as a board member of several corporations, including
Honeywell Inc. This broad-based background, Big Board
insiders say, makes Mr. Donaldson a logical choice for
chairman.
   Big Board officials say the exchange needs a strong leader
to fill the shoes of Mr. Phelan, who is widely credited with
helping reassure investors during the October 1987 stock
market crash. The Big Board's search committee is known to
have brought up such names as famed investor Warren Buffett,
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.; Frank T. Cary, former
chairman of International Business Machines Corp.; and
investment banker James D. Wolfensohn. But some of them
didn't appear interested in the job.
   One individual considered early for exchange chief was
Richard H. Jenrette, another of Donaldson Lufkin's founders
and currently chairman of Donaldson Lufkin's parent,
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.
   And John S. Chalsty, Donaldson Lufkin's president and
chief executive officer, was named in June as a Big Board
vice chairman. Mr. Chalsty is the highest-ranking officer of
the exchange from a large Wall Street firm.
