   WASHINGTON -- Members of a Congressional subcommittee and
Justice Department officials raised new doubts about the
reliability of navigational units Northrop Corp. supplied for
the Air Force's fleet of nuclear cruise missiles.
   Meanwhile, documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal
indicate that the missile's prime contractor, Boeing Co., was
alerted long ago about deficiencies the parts might have at
extremely low temperatures, raising questions about that
company's role in the controversy.

   Members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
strongly disputed claims by the Air Force and the two
contractors that the navigational units don't pose any safety
hazards in real-world conditions.
   The navigational units are supposed to operate at
temperatures as low as 65 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, a
standard applied throughout the military for more than three
decades. But since the early 1980s, laboratory tests
consistently have shown that a silicone fluid called DC-200
inside the Northrop units freezes long before the 65-below
benchmark is reached.
   During an emotion-charged hearing -- punctuated by
personal attacks against Pentagon acquisition chief John
Betti -- lawmakers also ripped into the Defense Department,
accusing it of looking the other way and of moving to resume
business as usual with the Northrop division that made the
suspect components. As a result of the dispute, the division
has been suspended from receiving new federal contracts for
the past year.
   "It's 65 degrees below sometimes in Minnesota on the
ground in winter," fumed Rep. Gerry Sikorski, adding that the
nuclear missiles are supposed to be carried by B-52 bombers
flying at 50,000 feet or higher. "We're talking about
extreme, sensitive nuclear crisis situations . . . where this
thing needs to work," said the Minnesota Democrat.
   Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) said that Northrop's
falsification of laboratory tests -- a charge to which the
big contractor pleaded guilty earlier this year -- "is so
serious that . . . neither Justice Department nor Air Force
internal documents offer any hope that the missile will work
in combat." The performance of the cruise missile in sub-zero
temperatures was the focus of a front-page story in The Wall
Street Journal on Friday.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones and President Kent Kresa
declined to testify, prompting angry outbursts from lawmakers
who pointed to $35 billion in defense contracts the company
has received since the early 1980s. Such lack of cooperation
"is an incredible outrage," shouted Rep. Jim Slattery (D.,
Kan.).
   Northrop has maintained that it always has acted
responsibly in dealing with the cruise-missile parts, and a
spokesman said over the weekend that "we went in and did what
we could do" to straighten out any improprieties at the
factory where the navigational units were manufactured.
   But Mark Richard, a senior Justice Department prosecutor,
told the committee that "failure of the units is of critical
proportions." Moreover, in a March 13 letter to Pentagon
officials who are leaning toward lifting the suspension
against the Northrop division, federal prosecutor William
Fahey asserted: "Unless the Air Force is able to properly
test these {components} under the `worst case' scenario, it
can never have the degree of confidence necessary in the
weapon's operational capability."
   Mr. Fahey, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, is
pressing the Air Force to require Northrop to retest each
navigational unit in the lab at 65 below zero for at least
two hours, and to "pay for a program to correct" any defects
that are found.
   Northrop, company documents show, knew by 1983 that its
navigational unit did not meet the temperature requirement.
   But the latest Northrop document suggests that fully seven
years earlier, when the cruise missile was still under
engineering development, Boeing itself became aware of
low-temperature restrictions on the navigational units. In a
sworn statement that was made in February but wasn't made
public, former Northrop executive Harold Johnson asserted
that Boeing knew as early as 1976 that the units were
sensitive to sub-zero temperatures and would require a brief
"warm-up period following non-operational storage" at 65
below zero.
   Mr. Johnson, who says in the statement that he negotiated
the original deal with Boeing to supply the parts, went on to
note: "I further informed Boeing that the reason . . . was
that the fluid used in the {unit} becomes slushy after
exposure to cold temperatures."
   As part of its plea agreement in February, Northrop
forfeited $17 million in penalties, one of the largest fines
ever imposed upon a defense contractor. But the government
dropped all of the charges related to supplying navigational
units that allegedly couldn't meet the 65-below-zero
requirement as part of a settlement package. Those
allegations had been the heart of the prosecutors' case.
   Mr. Richard of the Justice Department testified that a
major reason for abandoning the low-temperature charges was
"the last-minute disclosure of a witness" who claimed that
the two companies had a "side agreement" to warm up the
components prior to launch.
   A spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing insisted yesterday
that the company had no knowledge that the navigational
equipment "did not meet specifications" until the criminal
investigation of Northrop's activities came to light in 1987.
He added that Boeing never has been the subject of a criminal
investigation related to the cruise missile, and doesn't face
the threat of administrative scrutiny either.
   Upset that the Air Force loosened low-temperature testing
requirements on other Northrop weapons -- which the Justice
Department says dealt a "severe blow" to its prosecution of
the cruise-missile case -- lawmakers blasted Mr. Betti for
failing to keep close enough track of the company's
activities. "You don't know what your managers are doing,
{and} your managers don't know what Northrop is doing," Rep.
Dingell snapped. "I am worried that no one knows what is
going on."
   Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas) flatly asserted: "I have some
doubts about whether you're the right man" to run Pentagon
acquisitions.
   Mr. Betti, acknowledging that he has paid hardly any
attention to the wide-ranging criminal probes, allegations
and convictions involving Northrop, nevertheless told angry
lawmakers that, "I have no reason to . . . recommend" barring
the entire company from new Pentagon contracts.
   Yet the Justice Department, along with senior members of
the subcommittee, said debarment is required, given what Rep.
Dingell called "over a dozen ongoing" grand jury
investigations focusing on Northrop. A company spokesman,
however, discounted such talk, saying "those are
investigations" and nothing more.
   Citing a letter earlier this month from the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles to Northrop, the spokesman
added that the company is not "either a subject or a target"
of an investigation connected with a recent, highly
publicized raid of the factory where it makes a section of
the F/A18 fighter. Rather, that inquiry is apparently limited
to one employee, the spokesman said. "The Justice Department
had ample opportunity to clarify that issue at the hearing,
but never did. You have to wonder why."
   The spokesman also said that Mr. Kresa was given only six
working days to prepare for the hearing and that one of Mr.
Jones's attorneys was out of the country and a family member
had to be hospitalized for a medical emergency last week.
Both executives, he added, have expressed a desire to
testify.
