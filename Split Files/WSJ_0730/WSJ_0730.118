   The New York state Consumer Protection Board is asking
state regulators to conduct a special probe into whether
phone customers were hurt by alleged improprieties at Nynex
Corp.'s purchasing unit.
   The board plans to file a petition today requesting the
state Public Service Commission cut New York Telephone rates
by $31 million in addition to the $290 million rate reduction
and $164 million refund it proposed two weeks ago. New York
Telephone has asked the PSC for a $1.4 billion rate increase
over three years.

   Richard Kessel, executive director of the Consumer
Protection Board, said the $31 million was not a final
number, but rather a "marker" in the current rate case. The
final rollback, he said, could amount to much more. Mr.
Kessel said there wasn't enough time in the nine-month rate
case to fully investigate Materiel Enterprises Co. "If we
leave it in the rate case, we won't be able to give it the
attention it needs," he said.
   New York Telephone had no immediate reaction to the
Consumer Protection Board proposal, but a spokesman said the
company has been trying to keep the focus on the "critical
financial issues." The orderly process initially set up by
the PSC, he said, "has become sidetracked so much by what is
going on outside the hearing room." Hearings in the rate case
begin today.
   The rate case has unearthed alleged misconduct at annual
conventions for suppliers. Women allegedly were hired for
entertainment and sex at the conventions, which were
organized by a top executive in the purchasing unit who was
fired by the company in 1988. Nynex, which investigated the
matter in 1988 and dismissed two employees and disciplined
seven others, has said that employees who attended did so at
their own expense and on their own time. However, rate-case
documents indicate some Nynex attendees did not take vacation
time and that suppliers may have picked up hotel room tabs.
   The New York attorney general's office, a party to the New
York rate case, said it "completely supports" the idea of
separating the Materiel Enterprises investigation from the
rate case, but said the initial $31 million rate cut was far
too little. Charlie Donaldson, a lawyer in the attorney
general's office, said that the only full operations audit to
date -- examining contracts for equipment removals from
telephone central offices -- found $20.9 million in over
payments on $22.4 million of charges.
