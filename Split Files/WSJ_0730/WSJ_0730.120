   Visa International is going after American Express Co.
again -- and this time it's more aggressive than ever.
   Visa will unveil an ad campaign today, its first-ever
directed to merchants, to convince them that American
Express's higher fee to merchants is exorbitant. Visa also
charges the so-called discount rate -- the fee merchants pay
for each sale made with a card. But Visa's fees are about 2%
for charges made with its card, while American Express's fee
schedule calls for payments of 3.5% of each sale made with an
American Express card.

   In the latest campaign to woo customers from American
Express, a unit of Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., Visa
is planning a direct-mail package to 250,000 merchants. The
mailing will ask the merchants to remove all American Express
signs, putting Visa signs on doors and cash registers
instead. Visa also urges merchants to ask its customers,
"Would you like to put this on your Visa?" when ringing up a
sale.
   The move on American Express comes as Visa's card ranks
are steadily increasing. But the company has been trying to
burnish its image by attracting more of the heavy-charging
consumers that make up the bulk of American Express's
franchise.
   "We feel the merchant community doesn't have the real
facts on how the two brands compare," said Brad Morgan,
executive vice president at Visa. Mr. Morgan said Visa is
escalating its effort to overcome "the myth that merchants
have no choice but to accept American Express if they want to
go after the upscale consumer."
   The ad campaign, which makes its debut in many
publications this week, pitches a toll-free number that
merchants can call to get a "Profit Improvement Calculator."
This product shows merchants how much money they would keep
if they converted American Express sales to Visa sales.
   Experts who watch the credit card industry predicted it
isn't likely many merchants will offer Visa cards exclusively
as a result of the campaign. But some said Visa's strategy is
sound: "This is the first time that anybody has ever
presented a real strong case for the merchant to look at the
bottom line," said Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson
Report, a newsletter. "Most merchants really make more money
honoring bank cards."
   American Express indicated it will retaliate, but wouldn't
provide specifics. "This gives new meaning to the expression
`frustration marketing,'" a spokesman said. He said that
while the company charges higher fees, it "also delivers a
customer that spends nearly three times as much as the
customer who comes in and uses a bank card." American Express
said average annual spending on its card is $3,000, compared
with $1,050 for a bank credit card.
