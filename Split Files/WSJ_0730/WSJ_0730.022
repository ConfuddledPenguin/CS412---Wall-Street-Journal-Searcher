   WASHINGTON -- The International Finance Corp., a World
Bank affiliate, said it will join with a group of European
banks in providing a $70 million loan for a $321 million
crude-oil pipeline project in Colombia.
   The IFC will provide half the loan.

   The borrower, Oleoducto de Colombia, will operate a
295-mile pipeline to transport crude oil from oil fields in
the Llanos and Magdalena Valley regions to a coastal
terminal.
   The IFC said the project will have an initial capacity to
move 150,000 barrels a day. The capacity may be increased
later.
   Other financing will include about $100 million in equity
capital from the owners of the pipeline venture and export
credits from Argentina, Brazil, France and the U.S.
   The European banks participating in the IFC-arranged
financing include Societe Generale of France; Deutsche Bank
Luxembourg, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG of West Germany;
Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur; ABN Bank; Banque
Nationale de Paris; Credit Lyonnais; and Banque Sudameris.
