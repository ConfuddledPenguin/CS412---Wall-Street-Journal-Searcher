   HOUSTON -- Conquest Exploration Co. said it has failed to
receive proposals for a merger or sale of all or part of the
company that it deems acceptable and is terminating the
bidding process. In January, the exploration and production
concern hired an investment banking concern to assist with a
possible sale of all or parts of the company.
