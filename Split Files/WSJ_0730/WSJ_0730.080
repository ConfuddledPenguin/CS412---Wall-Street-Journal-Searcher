   Citizens First Bancorp Inc., Glen Rock, N.J., reported a
$34.5 million second-quarter loss and predicted a $15 million
to $17 million deficit for the year because of a large
increase in its reserve for possible losses on bad loans.
   The quarterly loss equals $1.61 a share. It had net income
of $9.2 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.

   For all of 1989, the banking concern earned $37.2 million,
or $1.73 a share. Citizens expects to return to profitability
in 1991, Chairman Richard G. Kelley said.
   The $70 million increase in the loan-loss reserve was
required after a routine examination by the comptroller of
the currency, Mr. Kelley said.
   "The increasingly stringent regulatory banking environment
nationwide is now penetrating our region, requiring banks to
add to loan-loss reserves because of the widespread downturn
in the real estate industry," he said. But Mr. Kelley
described Citizens' loan portfolio and cash flows as "very
strong."
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Citizens closed at $8.75, up 12.5 cents.
