   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration halted the
distribution of Cal-Ban 3000 diet pills after receiving
numerous reports of the pills swelling in the throats of
consumers and causing injuries.
   Health Care Products Inc., Lutz, Fla., was directed to
recall all Cal-Ban 3000 tablets and capsules on the U.S.
market as the FDA moved toward banning more than 100
diet-product ingredients, including guar gum, sea kelp and
karaya gum, that have never been proven effective.

   The agency advised consumers against taking the Cal-Ban
products after investigating 19 reports of throat
obstructions. Cal-Ban's active ingredient is guar gum, a
complex sugar that swells when wet and can create a sense of
fullness in the stomach. But if Cal-Ban pills become stuck in
the throat or esophagus, they can swell and cause
obstructions, according to Peter Rheinstein, director of the
FDA's office of drug standards.
   Ten dieters on Cal-Ban have been hospitalized, and one
person died of a blood clot that reached the lungs a week
after undergoing surgery for an obstructed throat, Dr.
Rheinstein said.
   On July 18, Florida health officials ordered Health Care
Products, which also does business as Anderson Pharmacals,
Tampa, Fla., to stop selling Cal-Ban 3000 on the strength of
50 cases involving injuries. The FDA plans to look into those
cases. The agency is investigating similar diet products to
determine if they pose the same health hazard as Cal-Ban.
   The agency has come under pressure from Congress to crack
down on the over-the-counter sale of ineffective
weight-control products. The FDA announced in May that
unproven diet-product ingredients will be taken off the
market under a rule proposal to be published this fall.
   An FDA spokeswoman said guar gum is approved for use in
such foods as cheese, salad dressings and ice cream. She said
so little is added that it doesn't pose any health risk.
