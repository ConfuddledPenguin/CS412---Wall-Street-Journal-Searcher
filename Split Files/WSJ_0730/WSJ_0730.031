   NEW YORK -- Further losses are in store for the stumbling
dollar, currency analysts say.
   With the U.S. economy creeping along like a turtle and
increasing expectations of further easing by the Federal
Reserve, odds for a let-up in dollar selling are seen as
slim.

   "The bearish sentiment about the dollar is still there,"
says Sandra Antonello, a currency analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Sellers pounced on the dollar Friday because of the
unexpectedly weak U.S. gross national product data reported
for the second quarter. At the close of trading in New York,
the dollar was quoted at 1.6120 marks and 149.15 yen, down
from 1.6245 marks and 150.37 yen late Thursday. Sterling rose
to $1.8375 from $1.8140.
   In Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading at 149.05 yen at
mid-morning; it closed at 150.75 yen in Tokyo Friday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6113
marks, down from Tokyo's Friday close of 1.6235 marks.
   The dollar is getting close to the post-World War II low
of 1.5630 marks that was set Jan. 4, 1988. Against the yen,
however, it is far above the record low of 120.25 yen hit
that day.
   Largely because of renewed weakness in Japan's stock and
bond markets and the Bank of Japan's reluctance to raise its
5.25% discount rate, the dollar's recent losses against the
yen have been less than those against western European
currencies.
   GNP expanded at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 1.2%
in the second quarter, after growing at a 1.7% pace in the
first quarter, much slower than the 1.8% expected by many
traders.
   The government reported nearly every major indicator of
private economic activity declined, and only a buildup of
business inventories and a rise in government spending kept
the overall economy from contracting during the period.
   Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby said he expects the
economy to strengthen now that the Federal Reserve has
loosened credit. "We expect a rebound in economic activity in
the second half of the year, especially in the fourth
quarter," he said.
   But some economists aren't as upbeat as Mr. Darby,
particularly with growth in the U.S. -- even if it
rejuvenates -- likely to pale in comparison with that in West
Germany and Japan.
   The latest GNP report "gives us more of a picture of a
weakening trend in economic growth than might have been
supposed," says Kevin Logan, chief economist at the Swiss
Bank Corp.
   Sluggishness in construction will probably put "a drag on
GNP in the third quarter," Mr. Logan says. Construction was
lively in the first quarter because of the unusually mild
winter and helped spur economic growth.
   Any evidence of economic weakness tends to take a toll on
the dollar because of expectations for further easing by the
Federal Reserve. Lower U.S. interest rates could undercut the
dollar by making interest-bearing dollar-denominated
investments less attractive and by lowering yields on
Eurodollar deposits in the Eurocurrency market.
   The Federal Reserve loosened credit July 13, a day after
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said the central bank was poised
to ease to "offset" an undesired rise in bank-loan rates.
   When Mr. Greenspan later hinted that further easing may be
ahead, he indicated the central bank would most likely move
in response to continued banking system strains or agreement
on a solid plan to trim the federal budget deficit. However,
he also said he now sees the risk of recession as "a shade
larger" than the risk of a rise in inflation.
   Given all these factors, there is the potential for the
Fed to let the federal funds rate fall substantially,
economists say.
   The federal funds rate, the rate on reserves traded among
commercial banks overnight, now averages 8%. The steering of
the federal funds rate is the U.S. central bank's primary
monetary policy tool.
   "We could see, by the end of the year, another {half a
percentage point} reduction in fed funds," says Mr. Logan of
Swiss Bank.
   Bearish sentiment toward the dollar is running high
because U.S. interest rates are declining while rates in West
Germany, Japan and other major industrial nations are
expected to remain firm.
   Mr. Logan sees the dollar falling to 1.57 marks by the end
of September.
   Says Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at Harris
Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago: "The dollar's not attractive
to global investors right now. Interest rates rule the
foreign exchange markets these days. The market is focusing
on high-yielding currencies."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $367.80 an ounce, down $1.50.
Estimated volume was a moderate 4.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$368.25 an ounce.
