   Arix Corp. said it expects to report a loss of $20 million
to $22 million for its fourth quarter, ended June 30, because
of charges related to shrinking its main unit.
   The San Jose, Calif., minicomputer maker also said its
deteriorating condition will reduce its ability to borrow
under its existing bank line of credit to about $2.9 million.
It said it is seeking alternate financing sources but didn't
elaborate.

   Arix has been hurt by declining revenue from its biggest
customer, Unisys Corp.
   It said the charges, which will total $12 million to $14
million, relate to employee-termination costs, to costs of
terminating leases and to write-downs.
   Arix also said it expects to report that fourth-quarter
revenue plunged 65% to $7 million from $20 million. For the
first nine months, the company had a net loss of $11.2
million, or $1.46 a share, on revenue of $49.6 million.
   In over-the-counter trading Friday, Arix closed at
$1.9375, down 6.25 cents.
