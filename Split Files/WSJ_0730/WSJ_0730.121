   Taking the First Snips
   At Alzheimer's Deposits

   CHEMICAL "SCISSORS" in the brain may hold the key for
future Alzheimer's disease therapy.
   Researchers increasingly believe that Alzheimer's disease
is caused by deposits in the brain of a hard, insoluble
protein that kills nerve cells. The substance, beta amyloid,
is sprinkled in rope-shaped plaques in the brains of people
with Alzheimer's, a degenerative brain disorder responsible
for about 100,000 deaths a year in the U.S. Biotechnology
labs and universities currently are racing to learn how brain
cells assemble and lay down these plaques.
   Since this spring, several labs have identified natural
enzymes that snip damaging shards of the beta amyloid from a
larger "precursor" protein normally produced by cells
throughout the body. Scientists now think some defect in
enzymes that control the brain's normal handling of this
precursor protein causes the disease. Chemicals that suppress
activity of these "scissors" -- or promote other enzymes --
might serve as prototypes for new drugs.
   Scientists at Cephalon Inc., West Chester, Pa., recently
identified an enzyme dubbed "clipsin" that's found in higher
amounts in brain samples from deceased Alzheimer's patients.
A new drug might inhibit clipsin. Researchers at Athena Inc.,
San Francisco, have found another enzyme, called secretase,
that naturally chops up the beta amyloid. Another drug might
mimic the action of secretase.
                                                                                                       

   Vitamin A May Assist
   Fight Against Measles
                                                                                                       

   HELP may be on the way for the recent surge in U.S.
measles cases.
   The Centers for Disease Control says 17,850 measles cases
were reported in the U.S. through May, a 40% increase from a
year earlier. The disease caused 41 deaths in 1989, up from
35 a year earlier in the U.S., where some children in urban
areas aren't being vaccinated.
   The highly contagious disease, which isn't serious for
most children, is normally treated with bed rest. But severe
complications, such as pneumonia, ear infections and
diarrhea, are on the rise. The problems are even more common
outside the U.S., where about two million children die from
the virus each year, making measles one of the world's major
killers.
   Now doctors in South Africa are reporting that measles can
be treated with injectable doses of vitamin A, which cut the
risk of death and complications in a study of 189 sick
children. The doctors, at the University of Cape Town, found
that among a group of children given 120 milligrams of
vitamin A, there were two deaths, while a similar group
administered a placebo had 10 deaths. The treated group also
recovered more quickly from pneumonia and diarrhea and spent
less time in the hospital.
   "The results . . . indicate a remarkable protective effect
of vitamin A," the researchers write in the New England
Journal of Medicine. Scientists suggested 50 years ago that
vitamin A might be useful against measles, but the first
clinical test came only two years ago. The new and larger
test provides the confirming proof expected to change
treatment world-wide, the researchers say.
                                                                                                       

   Another Site in Search
   For Mental-Illness Gene
                                                                                                       

   THE QUEST for genes that cause mental illnesses has turned
up a tantalizing clue.
   Scottish researchers believe they've found the approximate
location of a gene that, when damaged, may make some people
prone to depression and schizophrenia. The finding is
expected to spur scientists engaged in a frustrating hunt for
genes. Their efforts have been dogged in the past three years
by claims that have been questioned by subsequent findings.
   In their report, researchers at Royal Edinburgh Hospital
and Western General Hospital in Edinburgh say they've found a
large family in which inheritance of a damaged bit of genetic
material may be responsible for an unusually high prevalence
of psychiatric disorders. The scientists discovered a strange
mutation in the genetic material of 34 of 77 family members,
suggesting it was passed from generation to generation.
Sixteen of the 34 people with the mutation had psychiatric
problems; only five of the 43 without it had a diagnosable
illness.
   The scientists, led by David St Claire, wrote in the
British journal Lancet that the mutation occurred at a spot
where a gene might be located on chromosome 11, one of the 23
matching pairs of chromosomes in every cell. The chromosome
11 site is intriguing, because it's near a gene that produces
dopamine, a chemical that helps nerve signals travel about
the brain.
   Three years ago, researchers found evidence of a
manic-depression gene on chromosome 11 in studies of a large
Amish family in Pennsylvania. But re-analysis of the data
overturned that finding last year. The gene tracked by the
Scottish researchers is on a different side of chromosome 11.
                                                                                                       

   Odds &amp; Ends
                                                                                                       

   TEXAS A&amp;M University researchers say they have produced a
better polio vaccine by modifying the polio virus. Colin
Young says he blocked the germ's tendency to mutate by
tinkering with its DNA. A vaccine based on the more stable
virus won't vary from batch to batch and is less likely to
cause complications sometimes tied to current vaccines, he
says. . . . U.S. Agriculture Department researchers in
Peoria, Ill., say they have invented a low-cholesterol,
whipped-cream topping by replacing butterfat with vegetable
oils. The dessert product would come as a frozen fat-free
milk concentrate that can be thawed, flavored and whipped.
Tests show it can stay foamy for 24 hours.
