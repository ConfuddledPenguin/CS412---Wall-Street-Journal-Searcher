   The pleasures of the rerun season are not many, but they
exist. For example, if you missed "The Simpsons" the first
time, you now have a chance to see what all the talk is
about, and also to ponder the singular crisis such a success
can produce.
   The creators of "The Simpsons" and the folks at Fox, you
see, have let it be known that they are in a gut-wrenching
dilemma because stores are selling Bart Simpson T-shirts by
the drove along with numerous other forms of Simpsoniana. The
producers say they fear the show's image will be cheapened,
its fans offended by this terrible commerce. Indeed, all over
Los Angeles TV executives are bewailing the threat of crass
commercialism -- a fact so inherently droll in itself that it
could be the premise for a successful sitcom.

   For anyone who hasn't yet made acquaintance with "The
Simpsons," it purports to be about an animated children's
cartoon family, but two minutes into any episode and it also
is wholly adult satire. Five-year-olds love it as a cartoon,
while 50-year-olds love it for its bite and wit.
   The Simpson brood consists of father Homer, his
long-suffering wife, Marge, their heroically cynical son
Bart, one regular-size female child and one baby daughter.
Week after week this clan gets caught in a mess, usually the
fault of Homer, a braggart and a lout, but an often
sympathetic braggart and lout. Every new stew of troubles
sends the Simpsons off on a wild ride, hurling coldly precise
barbs at the absurdities of the age.
   In one segment, Homer decides the family should seek the
counsel of a therapist, one Dr. Marvin Monroe, the sort of
professional luminary who advertises on late-night TV. During
the visit, the Simpsons are connected to electric generators,
and told to commence expressing themselves by giving each
other small shocks. They set about trying to fry one another,
while the therapy industry comes under assault by a barrage
of one-liners. That is the cartoon part, but there is, as
always, a larger point animating events -- in this case, such
dubious cures as electric shock "aversion therapy." One
recalls, in particular, the obedience experiments of the late
Stanley Milgram, who years ago made news with a scientific
study showing how astonishingly easy it was to get his
subjects to zap unseen victims with what they believed were
higher and higher voltages, whenever the experimenter ordered
them to throw the switch.
   The range of political, cultural and social allusions per
"Simpsons" episode can be breathtaking. In one segment, Homer
gives Marge a bowling ball for her birthday, it being his
habit to buy gifts that only he will be able to use. The
non-athletic Marge, in revenge, rushes off to the nearest
lanes, ball in hand, attracting on the way a tall, dark and
gallant French rake who has somewhat improbably dedicated his
life to the art of bowling. The solemnity and dialogue of his
lessons, their mimicry of every Hollywood portrayal of
ferocious ballet teachers and other mad maestros who live
only for their art, are hilarious.
   The same episode yields a full-scale dream sequence with a
facsimile Fred and Ginger, whirling around a room to "Night
And Day" -- Marge's fantasy of her assignation with the
bowling maestro. In the end, Marge must choose between
romance with the kegling Frenchman and fidelity to dreadful
Homer. Marge drives toward the Frenchman's lair, changes her
mind, and rushes off to reclaim Homer at his factory. And
now, with every detail in place, "The Simpsons" unreels its
version of the triumphal last scene of "An Officer and a
Gentleman" -- in which Richard Gere rushes into the factory
to claim Debra Winger from the assembly line.
   Some aspects of "The Simpsons" have upset those who worry
that the rascally and cynical Bart Simpson may not be the
best role model for his younger fans. Better Bart than
Madonna, I say.
   In one sequence, the show's creators find themselves in a
quandary, because Bart has to learn to defend himself against
the violent school bully. No half measures for a Simpson.
Bart studies total war strategies from a military expert,
enlists schoolmates in a large army, and arms them for
merciless combat against the bully. You can see the problems
this posed for sensitive producers: scenes involving military
training, strategy, weapons, militance, revenge, joy in
taking that revenge -- in short everything young people are
supposed to be taught to disapprove of, everything that is
anathema to progressive, enlightened thinkers.
   Not only did the whole thing look like a lot of fun, the
military strategy was shown to work, as such things do in
life. The show's creators dealt handily with their exposure
to attack from non-violence crusaders by tagging on a
postscript explaining that "The Simpsons" did not mean to
glorify war. Before this message could become oppressive in
the normal way of such moralizing, the voiceover rushed on
with the sprightly observation that there were no good wars
except the Revolutionary War, World War II and "Star Wars."
   "The Simpsons," in short, is one of the best things to
have come around in a long time. All the handwringing by its
producers and others worrying about commercialism and
overkill, of course, says something about the atmosphere in
which television's creative minds work. In that atmosphere,
all success is perceived as a phenomenon, the product of some
blip or fragile fashion nobody can explain and that some new
breeze can blow away as easily as it came. Best not to offend
viewers by vulgar sales of cups imprinted with the name of
their favorite show.
   Does this make any sense? The truth is that every
long-term television success has always been wholly
understandable, the roots of that success obvious. Viewers
tastes hang on altogether graspable matters such as a good
story, the appeal of a character, even -- dare one say it? --
good writing. So enduring are viewers tastes for such things,
they still would be watching new episodes of the "The Mary
Tyler Moore Show" if they were available, as they will
continue to watch "Murphy Brown" and, from the way things
look, "The Simpsons."
