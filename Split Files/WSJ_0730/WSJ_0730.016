   SOUTHPORT, Conn. -- Hunter Environmental Services Inc.
said it reached an agreement with investor J. Anthony
Forstmann to acquire the remainder of Hunter Industrial
Facilities Inc., which is developing an underground
waste-processing plant in Texas.
   Currently, Hunter Environmental owns 63% and Mr. Forstmann
26% of Hunter Industrial. The rest is in public hands.

<TEXT>
   Hunter Environmental's principal assets are its Hunter
Industrial holdings and an interest in an Illinois utility
holding company. The merger with Hunter Industrial, a
spokesman said, will make "a more efficient company."
   Hunter Environmental will issue one common share for each
2.75 shares of Hunter Industrial's common and preferred that
it doesn't already own. To acquire all of Hunter Industrial,
the company will issue a total of 4.3 million shares,
reflecting conversion of certain debt securities to common
stock.
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Hunter
Environmental Service's stock closed at $4, unchanged. Hunter
Industrial trades over the counter on the pink sheets.
