   CINCINNATI -- Comair Holdings Inc. said it signed a
purchase option to buy 20 Saab 2000 aircraft valued at more
than $230 million from Saab-Scania AB, a Swedish aircraft
producer, for use by the Comair regional airline subsidiary.
   The company said it expects to sign a formal purchase
agreement in late 1991. The Saab turboprop aircraft, which
each seat 50 passengers, will be delivered to Comair between
1993 and 1997. The carrier already operates Saab-Scania's
33-passenger Saab 340 aircraft.
