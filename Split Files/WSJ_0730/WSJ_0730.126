   SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- MIPS Computer Systems Inc., a
computer concern, said it named Charles M. Boesenberg
president.
   Mr. Boesenberg, 42 years old, had been executive vice
president, marketing, and succeeds Robert C. Miller, 46, who
remains chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Boesenberg
joined MIPS from Apple Computer Inc., where he had been the
top sales executive.

   MIPS makes microprocessers based on a semiconductor
technology known as reduced instruction set computing, or
RISC, which allows for fast and powerful computing. The
company has been growing rapidly for several years and went
public last fall. In the first six months of 1990, it earned
$7.5 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $71.8
million.
   Mr. Miller said Mr. Boesenberg's appointment will
strengthen and broaden MIPS's management structure, which he
said is necessary for MIPS to deal with anticipated growth.
"This new structure should better position MIPS to become a
$1 billion corporation in the 1990s," Mr. Miller said.
