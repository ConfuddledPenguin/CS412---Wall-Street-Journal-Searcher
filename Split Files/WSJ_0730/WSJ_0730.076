   NEW YORK -- The July jobs report -- the first official
reading on the third quarter isn't likely to budge economic
forecasts out of the basement.
   Many economists began knocking down third-quarter growth
estimates to the lowest single digit after Friday's report
that real gross national product limped along at an annual
rate of 1.2% in the second quarter, after adjusting for
inflation. The payroll employment report, scheduled for
release Friday, and the July purchasing managers' index, to
be posted Wednesday, are expected to reflect continued
economic anemia.

   Most of the week's other reports round out June data. The
calendar includes June personal income and personal
consumption, leading economic indicators, construction
spending, manufacturing orders and shipments. Other coming
July statistics include agricultural prices and auto sales.
   The economy "looked like it might be caving in in the
second quarter," Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co.,
said. He expects the employment and purchasers' data "to
collateralize" the weakness. What's more, Mr. Sinai says he
believes inflation is still entrenched, raising the specter
of "stagflation."
   Mr. Sinai expects that about 85,000 new jobs were added to
non-farm payrolls in July, after taking into account the loss
of many temporary census workers. Factory jobs probably
dropped 15,000 to 20,000, he estimated. "That kind of
employment report would suggest real GNP between flat and 1%
growth" for the third quarter, he said.
   The consensus view is somewhat firmer, calling for job
creation of about 120,000 positions after accounting for
census workers, according to MMS International, a unit of
McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. Factory payrolls are thought to
have dropped by about 10,000, for an overall unemployment
rate of 5.3%, compared with 5.2% in June. Overall in June,
about 97,000 jobs were created, while manufacturing payrolls
shrank by 27,000.
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank,
shaded his third-quarter outlook lower after Friday's GNP
report. Now he expects a growth rate between 1% and 1.5%,
compared with the 1.5% he saw earlier. "It's not recession,
but we're skating on thin ice here," he said.
   Economists are keeping a close eye on the manufacturing
sector, which recently began to grow modestly. It seems much
of the factory activity in the second quarter stemmed from
inventory-building. Now the question is whether those
inventoried goods will be purchased, generating further
demand, or whether stockpiled goods will languish.
   The July purchasing agents' index, which gauges
manufacturing demand, is expected to weigh in at 50.8%, down
a bit from 51.1% in June. A reading exceeding 50% suggests a
manufacturing economy that is generally expanding, and a
level below 50% suggests contraction.
   The government's main forecasting gauge, the
leading-indicators index, is expected to be unchanged for
June after a 0.8% gain in May. Stock prices,
sensitive-materials costs, building permits and vendor
performance are expected to contribute positively to the
11-component index. But weak durable-goods orders and
declining consumer sentiment are thought to have offset gains
in other segments.
   June personal income and consumption data, to be released
today, are expected to be firmer than those for May. The
consensus view calls for income to have risen 0.4%, compared
with the 0.3% increase in May. Consumption is expected to
have risen 0.7%, largely because of a pickup in auto sales in
June after a flat May reading.
   The construction industry is expected to show continued
weakness. June construction spending is likely to have
dropped for the third consecutive month, with the consensus
expecting a decline of 0.6%. May construction outlays were
off 4%.
