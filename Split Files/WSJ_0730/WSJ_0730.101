   Petrobras, Brazil's government oil company, reported
first-half profit of $466 million, despite a June loss of $49
million.
   Reynaldo Aloy, financial director, said the June deficit
was due in part to government-set fuel prices, which have
been frozen since President Fernando Collor de Mello took
office in March. Petrobras President Luis Octavio da Motta
Veiga said in June that the government needed to raise
domestic fuel prices 10% to 15%.

   The June deficit also resulted from the creation of a $114
million fund to protect against losses from the privatization
of the Petromisa unit, Mr. Aloy said. Petromisa is one of
several Petrobras units to be sold under a national campaign
to cut government spending. Mr. Motta Veiga has said the
company will lay off 16,000 of 80,000 workers at Petrobras
and its units.
