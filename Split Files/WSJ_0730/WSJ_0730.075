   Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. reported a second quarter net loss
of $8.3 million, or 89 cents a share. Sales plunged 49% to

   The loss came on the heels of a $1.4 million first-quarter
loss and reflects general sluggishness in the toy industry
and problems in certain product lines, among other things.
   A federal court three weeks ago issued a preliminary
injunction halting sales of the San Francisco-based company's
new Game Genie video game. The order stemmed from a suit
brought by Nintendo of America Inc., a unit of Japan's
Nintendo Co., charging Lewis Galoob with copyright
infringement.
   For the six months, Lewis Galoob had a net loss of $9.8
million, or $1.05 a share, on sales of $61.6 million. In the
year-ago period, the company had profit of $7.1 million, or
74 cents a share, on sales of $93.6 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Lewis
Galoob closed unchanged at $4.375.
