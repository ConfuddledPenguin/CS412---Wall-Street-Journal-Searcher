   In your June 27 news article you mention that the banks
agreed on the amounts Mr. Trump could spend on charitable
contributions and personal/household expenses. The figure
published by other papers was about $450,000 a month, to be
reduced to $350,000 a month within a number of years.
   I consider it completely amoral, not to say repugnant, to
grant a man $5.4 million for his pocket money, a man who
built castles on air bragging that he never used his own
money, who has misused these borrowed funds to the detriment
of the people involved. Banks will suffer large losses, these
losses will be deductible from their taxes, so that
ultimately it will be the taxpayer who pays for it all.

Trump gets $5.4 million a year instead.
