   WARSAW -- Poland is writing the first textbook on the
transition to a market economy from a communist system. On
July 13 the Poles continued to spearhead East Europe's reform
movement when the parliament passed a historic bill on
privatization of state enterprises.
   More than 7,600 state enterprises are to be handed over to
the state treasury and transformed into limited liability
corporations with shares to be sold to the public within two
years. The government is awarding every adult Pole free
"privatization bonds" exchangeable for shares in the company
of his or her choosing. Workers will be given preferential
prices (at one-half market price) for up to 20% of their
company's shares. To quell the fears of many Poles of foreign
ownership, foreigners need official permission to purchase
more than 10% of a company's shares. The transition process
will be overseen by a newly created Ministry of Ownership
Transformation.

   There are still many wrinkles to be ironed out. Because of
the absence of developed markets, setting a price for the
shares involves a lot of guesswork. Which illuminates the
more general conundrum: You need to have a private market in
order to get one. Nevertheless, Poland must get on with the
process even if it means windfalls for some bargain hunters.
   But even given reasonable pricing there are problems.
Andrzej Byrt, the Polish commercial counselor in Brussels,
maintains that "if you take all the financial resources in
the hands of Polish citizens, they could only purchase about
6% of all state-run companies."
   The Polish reform program has been depicted as a sort of
reckless leap into the unknown. But this ignores a central
truth. The country was on the verge of implosion, the
salvation of which required drastic and immediate measures.
The new government responded to the crisis by embracing
far-reaching measures. It set about to "import" competition
so as to rationalize the price structure and effect a
Darwinian industrial selection process. Against the advice of
many a nonbeliever, the zloty was made internally convertible
-- that is, convertible for trade transactions, but not yet
for capital transfers -- at about 9,500 zlotys to the U.S.
dollar. Trade barriers such as import quotas and excessive
tariffs were eliminated or sharply reduced. The government
sold some assets of small state enterprises to aid
entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, domestic price controls and
subsidies were abolished.
   As a result, shortages are practically non-existent,
foreign goods readily available and hyperinflation stamped
out. May's $2 billion trade surplus exceeded that for the
entire previous year.
   Many reports cite a 30% drop in production as proof of the
failure of the reform. But these figures ignore a dramatic
increase in private production -- it is estimated that 50% of
food products are now sold directly by farmers -- unaccounted
for in the statistics of socialized industry. State
production now shows signs of stabilizing, as companies that
initially reduced production and raised prices after
subsidies were withdrawn investigate ways to produce
appealing products inexpensively.
   Despite these improvements, the economy is still in a
recession and saddled with a $42 billion foreign debt. The
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other sources
are rapidly funneling more aid into Poland. The debt has been
rescheduled again. But while foreign aid may help
infrastructure development, too often it can relieve pressure
for painful reforms.
   International trade, needed to pull Poland to its feet,
requires a favorable climate for foreign investors. As it
stands, a foreign investor can own up to 100% of a company,
with a minimum initial investment of $50,000. Foreign
investors also have no wage restrictions and receive an
automatic three-year tax holiday, extendable up to six years
if the business is deemed vital to Poland's economic growth.
But here the clarity is blurred by complicated tax laws,
vague property statutes and an outdated commercial code
(unchanged since 1934).
   Western investors also resent Poland's restrictions on the
repatriation of profits. In an effort to prevent capital
flight, the government has limited the amount a company can
repatriate to the excess of its export revenues over its
import spending. Where there are no export revenues it may
repatriate 15% of all earnings. This is a sore point among
Western investors who resent the obstruction of free mobility
of profits.
   Potential investors also cite the need to bring the
telecommunications and banking systems up to snuff. Although
both have been deregulated and can have 100% foreign
ownership, they remain seriously inadequate. Preliminary
evidence suggests that it will take 10 years and $10 billion
to give Poland an adequate communications system.
   One thing Poland could do immediately to please foreign
investors is eliminate the wage controls imposed in January.
The controls had a certain unpleasant logic when there was
nobody to bargain with workers for wages except socialist
managers indifferent to profit and loss. The concessions they
made to their employees drained the economy, exacerbated
inflation and significantly reduced real wages. Now that a
privatization framework is being established, however, the
labor market must be freed.
   The reform program has been propelled by a rare political
consensus for parliamentary democracy and speedy integration
into Europe. Lech Walesa's oft-questioned bid for the
presidency poses no threat to Poland's progress. Quite the
contrary, his experiences at the very heart of afflicted
socialist industry, his commitment to pluralism and speedy
reform and his tremendous popular support would make him a
powerful asset to the Solidarity government.
   The real danger to political stability comes from
third-way activists who throw hurdles in front of reform by
pointing to misleading production and income statistics. At a
recent conference in Vienna, Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard
economist who advises Solidarity, warned that claims that
real incomes have plummeted by 40% because of the reform
program are misleading. These claims are based on comparing
the nominal prices of goods in December -- when those goods
were in practice unavailable -- with their prices now that
they are freely available. The statistics do not account for
the elimination of six-hour lines for certain commodities and
the general feeling of improved living standards.
   As the largest country in Central Europe with a 38
million-strong consumer market, many acres of uncultivated
land and plenty of natural resources, Poland has much to
offer. Reform must be taken in bold strokes -- the
alternative is to go the way of the Soviet Union where reform
trickled in and the expectation of bold results goes
unfulfilled.
   Poland's challenge is therefore to stay the course. The
privatization bill was another monumental step in the right
direction. Continuing in this fashion, the unwritten chapters
of the Polish textbook will tell of the abjuration of
Poland's endemic economic deadweights and a successful
transition to a market economy.
