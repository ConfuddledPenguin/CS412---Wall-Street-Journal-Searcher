   XIAMEN, China -- "In the past, the Western imperialists
used military force against the Chinese people," an angry
Huang Zijian tells a U.S. visitor. "Now they are trying to
penetrate our thinking through peaceful means," the young man
says, tapping his head with his forefinger for emphasis.
   Heavy stuff -- particularly for a sixth grader. But in
today's China, schoolkids like Zijian are spitting out such
bellicose statements, aping an official campaign to study the
Opium War, a 19th century symbol of China's humiliation at
the hands of the West. The propaganda assault harks back to a
distant era but offers a blunt message for today: The West
still is China's enemy.

   Renewed anti-Western hostility is the latest chapter in
China's enduring struggle to come to grips with the rest of
the world. Beijing's leaders concede that, to modernize,
China must embrace Western technology and innovation. But
Beijing is equally determined to keep out "bourgeois liberal"
notions such as personal liberty and democracy, which so many
student protesters last year found appealing. It's a delicate
balance that experts believe isn't sustainable. Eventually,
they argue, the door to the world must either swing fully
open, or else be slammed shut.
   "China still can't figure out if it's the Middle Kingdom
or just a part of the world," says Peter Geithner, who
recently served as China representative of the Ford
Foundation.
   In the aftermath of last year's Tiananmen demonstrations,
the balance has tilted back toward hostility, as China's
hardliners try to prevent the global retreat of communism
from infecting China. The state-controlled press slams the
U.S. for alleged subversion. Officials sympathetic to the
West have been sacked or arrested. Intellectuals are barred
from meeting with foreigners. And Chinese who work for
foreign companies have been accused of being traitors.
   China's retreat toward isolation has been reinforced by
Western economic sanctions imposed after the Tiananmen
massacre. The result, diplomats say, is that China is now a
less reliable and relevant partner in resolving international
issues.
   "As long as China's leaders insist on playing up the
anti-Western rhetoric of the Cold War-era, the country simply
can't participate in meaningful international dialogue," says
a U.S. official.
   Suo Yudong, director of the local foreign affairs office,
is the chief "barbarian handler" in Hengshui, a drab city in
north China normally closed to foreigners who lack special
permission to visit. Indeed, only a few hundred Chinese
cities are freely accessible.
   A rare visit to Hengshui by a U.S. journalist reveals the
suspicion of foreigners that persists in China's heartland.
In a hotel room, Mr. Suo nervously fingers his American
visitor's short-wave radio. His unease recalls a slogan of
the 1960s, when most foreigners were barred from China: "Only
spies and traitors have radios."
   Satisfied, eventually, that the shortwave poses no threat
to China's security, Mr. Suo nonetheless refuses the
visitor's repeated requests over three days to venture
outside the hotel. A guard is posted in the hotel suite. To
keep the American from nosing around Hengshui's streets, all
interviewees are brought to the hotel room.
   "We cannot allow you to make any nonarranged contact with
the Chinese people," Mr. Suo explains.
   In Beijing, too, officials try to restrict contact between
Chinese and foreigners. Many Chinese organizations in the
capital have instructed their employees not to meet
foreigners without approval, which is rarely granted.
   Chinese officials deny that the state discourages
Sino-foreign contact. But Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State
Council, China's cabinet, told foreign journalists that at
least some officials want to do just that. "I would advise
you not to contact any Chinese," Mr. Yuan told the reporters.
"You see, Chinese people don't wear headbands designating
themselves as `good' or `bad' people. So you're better off
avoiding all contact whatsoever."
   Interestingly, while officials publicly slam the West and
its "bourgeois liberalism," many of China's senior leaders
have sent children to the U.S. to study. Senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's son attended the University of Rochester, for
example, while Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin's son is at
Drexel University.
   George Soros, a wealthy, Hungarian-born U.S.
philanthropist, clashed with China's xenophobia when he came
to Beijing in 1986 to set up a foundation to assist artists
and intellectuals. Arriving during China's reform era, he won
approval from several liberal officials associated with
then-Premier Zhao Ziyang. Mr. Soros agreed to donate $1
million a year to the project.
   But when last year's pro-democracy movement was crushed
and Mr. Zhao was sacked, Mr. Soros' laboratory of
biculturalism became a prime target of China's hard-line
leadership. The public security minister, Wang Fang, even
accused the foundation of being an arm of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency. The case linking the foundation to the
CIA fell apart, but the institute closed. Its Chinese
director, Liang Congjie, lost his job and came under
investigation.
   China's ideologues also are mounting campaigns to show the
masses that Western culture and democracy represent a quick
path to ruin.
   An Economic Daily article equates capitalism with AIDS. A
People's Daily editorial dismisses the Western political
tradition as "sham democracy." A speech by Li Ruihuan, a
Politburo member, asserted that the surge in China of
gambling, pornography and drugs is part of a plot by "hostile
overseas forces."
   In such a climate, it isn't surprising that Chinese
working for foreign-invested companies have been harassed.
The Chinese manager of a Shanghai-based venture came under
police investigation for trying to help his company apply for
a preferential tax rate. Investigators accused the employee
of treason for trying to "cheat the motherland" of its
rightful income.
