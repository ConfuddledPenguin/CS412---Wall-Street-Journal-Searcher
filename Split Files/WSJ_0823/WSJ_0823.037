   The United States is at war.
   The buildup in the Arabian desert is a prelude to victory
or defeat. It cannot be anything else.

   This will not be another comic opera engagement, the giant
of 250 million citizens scoring a famous victory over a
vacation island of 125,000, as in Grenada. It will not be a
lightning police action designed to replace our own
hand-picked, carefully trained bully boy, as in Panama. This
is already a high-stakes war, of nerves now but almost
inevitably of bloody victory or humiliating defeat. Only
stunning luck or incredibly deft diplomacy can forestall one
or the other, barring an unlikely cut-and-run by Saddam
Hussein.
   To describe what President Bush has ordered as anything
other than undeclared war is sophistry. We are attempting to
quarantine an aggressor. We are blockading the enemy, turning
back his shipping on the open seas. Much of what we are doing
is in cooperation with others, under a UN Security Council
mandate -- liberally interpreted -- in response to an
invasion which violated international law and threatens the
world's economic well-being.
   Behind the facade of a common front, however, stands the
unadorned reality of America as unilateral actor. If fighting
begins, we will do most of it. When assessments are made, the
U.S. will be measured first.
   It is too late to debate the president's wisdom on each
and every decision. For the record, let me say that I think
President Bush has acted with intelligence, courage and speed
in the wake of Iraq's seizure of Kuwait. He has acted for the
right reasons and for reasons of necessity -- which are not
entirely the same. But let me add that the Bush
administration's inclination to appease right up to the
moment of unavoidable rupture has reaped its predictable
harvest with Iraq, as it did with China. The president and
his chief lieutenants bear major responsibility for the
unchecked growth of Saddam's appetite and capacity for
serious mischief.
   When the war is over, they should be held accountable; for
the moment, however, past appeasement and our individual
responses to what has been done in the nation's name are
beside the point. What matters is that the U.S. is committed.
What is imperative is that we remain committed until Kuwait
is no longer occupied and Iraq is neutralized.
   Suddenly, what seemed important only yesterday has been
trivialized, the looming obsessions of public debate reduced
to relative insignificance. "Just Who Is David Souter?" asked
the cover of Time Magazine on Aug. 6. "Who cares?" is the
reply two weeks later. Europe has all but vanished; Southern
Africa's turmoil and Liberia's bloodletting are so much news
from nowhere; NASA's failures in space stray beyond the
public's sight.
   A large sign in the main waiting room of the Bangor,
Maine, international airport says it all:
   US Military: Good Luck, Hurry Back.
   President Bush has put significant numbers of American
servicemen and women in harm's way for the first time since
Vietnam. They will not be coming home any time soon. No
matter whether Saddam Hussein backs off or hunkers down, tens
of thousands of Americans will be stationed in the Middle
East for months, and perhaps years.
   The President and Congress must therefore promptly agree
on our national goals in the Persian Gulf and make them clear
to the American people and to our friends and enemies abroad.
Absent such a consensus, time is on Iraq's side, barring only
all-out war.
   Time is against us anyway, with or without consensus. The
longer American troops are in Saudi Arabia, the more certain
a fierce Arab reaction against their presence becomes.
Considering the region's history over the past two centuries,
Western expeditionary forces are hardly welcome, while
neither the widely rich sheikdoms nor the Saudi monarchy
excite much support in the Middle East. It will be
exceedingly difficult to hold even the most pro-Western or
dependent Arab states in a U.S.-run coalition for long. Very
few months are going to pass before the United States becomes
the enemy of virtually the entire Arab world.
   Time is our foe for another reason. If weeks stretch into
months and Saddam Hussein remains implacably in place, he
will achieve the popular support he has always sought in the
Middle East. Reaction against his aggression, of more
interest to Arab leaders than to their people in any case,
will be marginalized, while he will be admired for his
courage in standing up to Washington. Nothing succeeds like
success.
   Time is on Iraq's side because we are an impatient people.
This war is going to be costly -- in both military and
economic terms. Public support will erode the longer it drags
on without a resolution. Saddam is already playing skillfully
on the American psyche, holding U.S. citizens as hostages in
what he repeatedly asserts will be a very long game. Stories
about their families' grief and fear are prime time staples.
   All these considerations underline the pressing need for a
declaration of explicit goals to go with the implicit
declaration of war. The rationale for what we are doing must
be publicly presented, openly debated and formally endorsed.
   Central to forging a consensus is the proposition that we
are in this to win, whether in concert or alone. The
alternative is unthinkable, not least because Saddam Hussein
is no one-of-a-kind demon. There is a baker's dozen more cut
from his cloth from one end of the earth to the other, each
with an itch to march across frontiers. Let Saddam succeed,
or escape unscathed, and there will be no restraining them.
That way lies a world more unsafe than at any time since the
height of the Cold War.
   Losing is also unthinkable because it would almost
certainly remove the United States from the world scene as an
active player. We have been internationalist for almost 50
years because we feared world domination by powerful
totalitarians. That threat has all but vanished. If what
replaces it is a series of humiliations arising from the
assumption of responsibilities shunned by others no less
directly affected, the public outcry will not be long in
coming. Broad-based and populist rather than right- or
left-wing, it will be overwhelming. Eighteen years after
George McGovern made it his mantra at the Democratic
convention in Miami Beach, "Come home, America" will be the
rallying cry for a new national majority.
   So, to say last what might as well have been said first,
this is a conflict which requires a congressional declaration
of war the moment that American forces engage in combat. The
White House should seek every congressional approval required
or implied by law, starting with the War Powers Act. It is
going to a very long haul. That is why President Bush should
see to it that the requirements of the Constitution are as
honored as those who die fighting in its name and under its
authority. That's not only good government -- it's the way to
ensure that the nation will stay the course in what promises
to be a protracted and bloody crisis.
