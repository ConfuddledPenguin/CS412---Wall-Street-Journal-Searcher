   HACKENSACK, N.J. -- IPCO Corp. said shareholders are to
vote in November on a board-approved proposal to change the
company's name to Sterling Optical Corp., reflecting the
completion of a divestiture program that stripped IPCO of all
but its primary business, a chain of optical stores.
   IPCO's last non-optical business, Whaledent International,
a dental products unit, was sold June 1 to Gurit-Heberlein
AG, a Swiss chemical and textile finishing company, for $32
million.
