   Securities lawyers have begun a court challenge to RJR
Nabisco Inc.'s current $6.9 billion refinancing, arguing that
it "deprives" the company's bondholders of certain rights.
   The new court filing, in Delaware's Court of Chancery,
continues a long series of suits and legal complaints
involving just about every financial transaction RJR has
undertaken in the past three years. So far, none of the court
cases has produced any awards for damages.

   Whatever the outcome, the latest legal filing is likely to
be watched closely by holders of RJR's high-yield junk bonds.
These bellwether bonds have undergone wild trading swings
this year, creating more than $1 billion of paper losses and
paper gains for investors at different stages. In large part,
RJR's $6.9 billion refinancing seeks to end the financial
havoc caused by its junk bonds.
   The new court filing is a proposed amended complaint to a
large class-action suit brought in late 1988 on behalf of
RJR's then-shareholders. That original suit tried and failed
to block the February 1989 acquisition of the New York
tobacco and food company by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   The proposed amended complaint would expand the 1988
shareholder suit to cover RJR's current refinancing, alleging
that it hurts bondholders. The proposed amended complaint
hasn't yet been accepted by the Delaware court, and RJR's
attorneys could challenge it. Usually, though, plaintiffs are
allowed to amend their complaints to include fresh
developments.
   RJR declined to comment on the latest filing, as did
attorneys at Abbey &amp; Ellis, New York, who helped draft the
proposed amended complaint.
   RJR on July 16 raised the interest rate on its 14.07%
bonds of 2007 to 17%, and boosted the rate on its 14.07%
convertible bonds of 2009 to 17.375%. Both those changes were
made to meet an obligation that the bonds trade at par, or
face value, on a "fully distributed basis." RJR also
announced plans to buy back $2.05 billion of junk bonds and
retire an additional $2.4 billion through an exchange offer.
   Shortly after RJR's announcement, the bonds of 2007 traded
as high as 95 1/2 cents on the dollar, while the bonds of
2009 traded as high as 97 cents on the dollar. It was their
best showing in nearly a year.
   More recently, though, both bond issues have slumped.
Yesterday, the bonds of 2007 were quoted at 84 1/2 cents on
the dollar, while the bonds of 2009 finished at about 89
cents.
   RJR has "failed to cause the securities to trade at par,
as warranted and covenanted," the proposed amended complaint
asserts. The complaint also objects to RJR's plans to retire
most of its convertible bonds of 2009, asserting that to do
so "diminishes the former shareholders' interest in the
equity value of RJR."
   The proposed amended complaint seeks the repeal of RJR's
refinancing moves so far, and unspecified monetary damages.
   Curiously, RJR's big bondholders generally haven't been
upset with their treatment in the refinancing. "I'm almost
satisfied," said Jack Utter, portfolio manager of the IDS
Extra Income mutual fund. Added Howard Marks, a managing
director at Trust Co. of the West: "I'm satisfied. I believe
the company made a good-faith effort to get the bonds to
par."
