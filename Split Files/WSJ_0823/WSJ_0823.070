   BUSH CALLED UP reservists to bolster the military buildup
in the Persian Gulf.
   The president wouldn't say how many reservists will be
activated, but a call-up of 40,000 is likely. He also said
the U.S. may wait a few days before ordering ships to stop
more vessels carrying Iraqi goods, and implied the Soviets
want the U.N. to be given more time to approve military
action for enforcing trade sanctions. In Moscow, officials
said Soviet military consultants are still training Iraqi
soldiers. Meanwhile, Baghdad claimed that planes flying in
from Saudi Arabia penetrated Iraqi airspace, but it was
unclear if the alleged incursion was into Iraq or Kuwait. A
Japanese Foreign Ministry official said Tokyo will consider
aid requests from Persian Gulf countries hurt by the
international blockade of Iraq.

   EAST GERMANY'S PARLIAMENT SET Oct. 3 as the date for
unification.
   After a tense late-night emergency session, the lawmakers
found the requisite two-thirds majority in the 400-seat
Volkskammer to fix the date for unity with West Germany. The
294-62 vote ended weeks of bickering that has split the
country's coalition government. "This is a truly historical
event," Parliament President Bergmann-Pohl said.
   The date for German unification is entirely up to East
Germany and the Volkskammer's decision requires no
ratification from Bonn.

the African National Congress.

discussions between Beijing and Hanoi.
