   Both the Vatican Observatory and the Max Planck Institute
of Germany have now raised the possibility of abandoning a
$200 million telescope project with the University of Arizona
because of the many delays caused by environmentalist
litigation and bureaucratic bumbling -- all over the issue of
whether the project threatens the red squirrels on
10,000-foot Mount Graham. If in fact these delays over a
rodent kill the telescope project, it will be yet another
dark cloud over the climate for doing science in the U.S. Add
to this concern the recent articles expressing complaints
about the difficulty of conducting clinical-drug trials in
the U.S. and the assaults on medical-research laboratories
from animal-rights activists. The international science
community may soon conclude that it is increasingly difficult
to do serious work in the United States.
   In Arizona, the telescope project disappeared into the
bureaucrats' cave after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
released an initial report in compliance with the Endangered
Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act,
concluding that the Mount Graham red squirrel wouldn't be
terribly affected by the construction of the telescopes on
the Arizona mountain. Construction began. And then was
stalled by groups such as the Sierra Club. Then, dissenting
biologists from the Fish and Wildlife Service itself said the
red squirrels would be decimated.

   And so the Sierra Club and others filed a lawsuit against
the government and the University of Arizona. The red
squirrel was also listed as a plaintiff, though it didn't
return our calls for comment. As it became clear that a
legal-bureaucratic web was being spun around the project to
kill it, the Arizona congressional delegation commissioned a
new report by the Fish and Wildlife Service, supposedly to
head off more litigation. While this report was being
assembled, the lawsuit was put on hold.
   That latest report concluded that while the original
biological opinion wasn't wrong, it wasn't sufficiently
thorough. It said, for instance, that the original study was
silent on the issue of "predation rates," noting that the
monitoring team saw a red squirrel killed by, of all things,
a spotted owl. Then there is the matter of "Global Climatic
Change," which is also "important for any long-term plan for
the Pinalenos. . . ." The report called for a re-examination
of the site.
   After the report's release, the university sought a
building permit from the U.S. Forest Service for construction
of Max Planck's telescope, which is ready to be installed.
The Forest Service believes it can issue the permit but is
reluctant to do so. The ball has now been booted to the
Justice Department, which is expected to provide an opinion
in the next few days untangling the dispute over the
construction permit.
   And oh yes, the environmentalists are threatening to sue
again. "I think the lawsuit will resurrect itself if they
start building again," says Robert Witzeman, spokesman for
the Maricopa Audubon Society, one of the plaintiffs in the
lawsuit. Mr. Witzeman feels that the university is "out to
lunch" and "irrational" for wanting to build the telescopes.
"No knowledge and no jobs will be lost" according to Mr.
Witzeman, if the telescopes are not built.
   Perhaps not, because the telescopes and the scientists who
go with them will likely be doing their work atop a mountain
in Switzerland, having long since concluded that serious
scientific minds aren't welcome in the United States, which
now belongs to the squirrels, owls and cuckoos.
