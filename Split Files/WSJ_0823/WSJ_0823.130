TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)

   DETROIT -- Old Kent Financial Corp. will "continue to
aggressively seek acquisitions," particularly to increase its
presence in the Chicago market, said chairman John C. Canepa.
   Canepa, speaking after addressing a group of Detroit
analysts, said the bank holding company has been considering
the acquisition of savings and loan associations because
"today's pressure on bank stocks and expectations of sellers
. . . has slowed acquisitions" of commercial banks. Savings
and loans -- either solvent or bought from federal regulators
-- offer "an avenue for low-cost expansion."

   B.P. Sherwood III, the Grand Rapids, Mich., company's vice
chairman and treasurer, said Old Kent will not seek to buy
thrifts to enter new markets. He said the company will
instead use its acquisitions to "enhance existing market
presence."
   Sherwood said Old Kent expects its loan activity to
moderate in the final two quarters of the year. He said the
company has seen its commercial and consumer lending taper
off recently, while residential lending has remained steady.
   The Old Kent officials said the company recently tightened
its real-estate lending policies and re-emphasized Old Kent's
policy of only lending in markets in which it has "a physical
presence."
   Canepa said Old Kent will seek to lower its expenses by
taking such steps as consolidating some of its subsidiary
banks and centralizing mortgage operations throughout the
company.
   Old Kent holds 21 banks with 195 offices in Michigan and
Illinois. In the second quarter ended June 30, the company
reported net income of $22.3 million, or 83 cents a primary
share, compared with $21.2 million, or 81 cents a primary
share, a year earlier. Old Kent had $8.1 billion in assets on
June 30 compared with $8.2 billion a year earlier.
