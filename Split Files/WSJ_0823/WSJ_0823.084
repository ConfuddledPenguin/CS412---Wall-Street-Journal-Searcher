   With the Persian Gulf crisis unfolding hour by hour, the
highly explosive oil market may be the last place for most
individual investors just now.
   But for people who can afford to take some calculated
risks, some experienced energy traders say it is possible to
bet on oil prices without losing more than your shirt.
Speculative investment strategies using options contracts,
they note, limit the potential loss to the amount put up --
the "premium" paid to buy the option.

   "Commodity markets are normally some of the riskiest
around, but recent events have made them even worse," says
James Colburn, energy-options strategist at E.D.&amp; F. Man Inc.
in New York. Even so, he says, there are some possible
options plays for people who "are able to put money aside for
high-risk situations."
   Options give holders the right -- but not the obligation
-- to sell (a put option) or to buy (a call option) something
at a fixed price for a specified period of time. In the case
of oil, that something is a futures contract for delivery of
oil several weeks or months from now.
   Speculators don't have to exercise the options to profit,
however. If they guess right about oil prices, they simply
sell the options. Put options gain in price when the
underlying futures contract declines in value, while call
options increase in price when the underlying futures
contract appreciates.
   If speculators guess wrong, the options expire worthless.
But the most they can lose is the premium. Option holders
also can't be forced out of the market for lack of funds by
rapidly falling or rising prices. That can happen to those
who try to play the market with futures contracts, because
futures holders are sometimes asked to post additional
good-faith money to maintain their market positions.
   For people who think oil prices will continue to rise, the
simplest option strategy might be to buy a "Dec. 29 call" --
a call option on the December crude-oil futures contract that
has an exercise, or "strike," price of $29. Speculators could
buy a Dec. 29 call on Tuesday for a premium of $1,650 ($1.65
per barrel, multiplied by 1,000 barrels per contract).
   How much people who buy the option could make depends on
how high oil prices go by Nov. 9, when the option expires.
The break-even point is the $29 strike price plus the $1.65
premium, or $30.65. If, for instance, the December crude
contract is selling for $32 a barrel, speculators could make
$1,350 ($1.35 times 1,000), not counting commissions. On the
other hand, if the December crude contract is selling for
anything less than $29, speculators would lose the entire
$1,650 they put up.
   They could reduce the potential loss by using what is
called a "bull call spread." In this strategy, they decrease
the cost of the call option they purchase by selling another
call option with a higher strike price but the same
expiration date.
   For example, as the table accompanying this article shows,
a speculator could buy a $27 call that costs $2,460, while
selling a $29 call for $1,650; the net cost would be $810.
That is the maximum that can be lost, regardless of what
happens to the price of crude oil. But this strategy also
limits the maximum potential profit, in this case to $1,190.
The option market rarely reduces risk without extracting a
price.
   People who believe the oil market has overreacted to
events in the Middle East should consider bearish strategies.
The simplest of those would be to purchase a December put
with a $25 strike price. On Tuesday, the price of a Dec. 25
put was $1,070 ($1.07 per barrel). When the option expires on
Nov. 9, this strategy would produce a profit if the December
crude-oil contract is below $23.93 (the $25 strike price
minus the $1.07 per barrel premium). The maximum potential
loss would be $1,070.
   Speculative bears could reduce the potential loss by using
a spread strategy that reduces the cost of the put option
they purchase by selling another put option with a lower
strike price. As with a bull spread, the trade-off is that a
"bear put spread" also limits the maximum potential profit.
   People who are uncertain about the future price of crude
or who believe it will remain in a trading range might
consider a neutral strategy known as a "butterfly spread."
Such spreads may be done with either puts, calls or both.
Typically, they involve the selling of two options that have
a strike price near the current price of the underlying
commodity. Simultaneously, options with strike prices both
higher and lower than the options sold are purchased.
   The accompanying table shows an example in which a
speculator sells a December call option and a December put
option, each with a strike price of $28. At the same time a
$31 call and $25 put would be purchased. This trade would
have a maximum profit of $2,270, which is the amount that the
speculator would make if December crude settles at $28 when
the options expire.
   The maximum potential loss would be $730, which would be
the minimum amount a speculator would be required to put up
to establish this butterfly spread. But that full loss would
be realized if the price of crude oil is just a little above
or below the strike price of the options sold. In the case of
the example shown in the table, any price below $26 a barrel
or above $30 a barrel would result in the maximum loss.
   Mr. Colburn of E.D.&amp; F. Man cautions that the option
market is now experiencing extremely wide bid-ask spreads
because of the volatility of futures prices. The wide spreads
-- plus commissions that typically run about $30 per option
at a discount broker -- mean that strategies that look good
on paper lose some of their luster in reality, he says.
   Still, he says, "Energy options are good for speculators
who are comfortable with the risks they entail and also have
a strong view on where they think oil prices are going to be
in the future."
