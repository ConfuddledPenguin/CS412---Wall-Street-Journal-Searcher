   Tokyo stock prices fell sharply Wednesday, sending the
Nikkei Index below 25000 points in the midafternoon and
marking a post-crash intraday low.
   The index bounced back after futures indexes recovered
moderately during the last hour, however.

   London shares, meanwhile, finished a choppy session mixed,
after an early surge evaporated in the wake of a soggy
performance on Wall Street.
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 1086.93 points
at 25210.91 on Wednesday. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 360 million shares, up from 284 million shares
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index plunged another
1003.96 points to close the morning session at 24206.95.
   In trading Wednesday, losers outnumbered gainers 986 to
34, while 38 issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section dropped 69.52 points, or 3.46%, to 1939.83.
   The second section index fell 148.05 points, or 3.71%, to
3838.32. Volume in the section was estimated at nine million
shares, down from 13.4 million shares Tuesday.
   The Nikkei Index bounced up 370 points toward the end of
the day from its intraday low of 24844 points, helped by
arbitrage buying and some bargain-hunting buying for steel
and blue-chip electrical shares, traders said.
   However, "the sentiment was extremely bearish," said
Shigenori Koto, general manager at equity division at
Sumitomo Life Insurance.
   As the Middle East remains vulnerable to a break-out of
war at the slightest provocation, major players on the market
"can't do anything other than wait and see," the official
said.
   The market saw few buy orders all day as overnight plunges
on European and U.S. stock markets fueled investors'
uncertainty about the direction of the Tokyo market, traders
said.
   Reflecting such uncertainty, futures indexes were pushed
down by active short hedging by institutions and a heavy
sell-off by one of the Big Four brokerage houses, triggering
arbitrage selling of stocks. As a result, cash indexes
plunged at a fast pace, traders said.
   Expectations for a possible increase of the official
discount rate grew on reports that the Japanese long-term
prime rate is likely to be raised 0.4 percentage point to
8.3% in September in response to rising market interest
rates, traders said.
   But observers said the market has discounted a possible
impact of a discount rate increase.
   Nevertheless, Naoya Ozawa, director in the research
department at James Capel Pacific, expressed his concern
that, because a discount rate rise is unlikely to fill out a
gap with interest rates on the money market, the increase may
not provide the perception that the move is final.
   Noticeable Wednesday was dumping by individual investors,
participants said.
   Because of recent stock market plunges, individuals are
required to place additional deposits by brokerage houses for
stocks they had bought on margin. Rather than investing
additional money in stocks, individual investors prefer to
reduce their holdings as the prospect for a sharp recovery of
the market remains poor, traders said.
   Meanwhile, institutions are feeling it's too risky to
trade in the cash market and mostly are seeking profits by
trading stock futures, some fund managers said.
   But as the market could be swayed in any direction by
rumors or news from the Middle East, institutions feel
insecure about keeping their accounts committed to either
sell positions or buy positions, said Koji Kamemura, general
manager of the fund managing department at Yasuda Mutual Life
Insurance.
   "We finish each day of trading by making sell positions
and buy positions even," he said.
   Petroleum and mining shares, which had been bought amid
rising oil prices, fell sharply Wednesday. Mitsubishi Oil
fell 105 yen to 975 yen (72 cents to $6.64). Nippon Oil was
down 180 yen at 1120 yen. Nippon Light Metal dropped 80 yen
to 1150 yen.
   Blue-chip electricals weathered well, with Hitachi ending
flat at 1250 yen and Toshiba flat at 925 yen.
   London stocks were bid higher throughout the morning in a
technical adjustment to recent sharp drops, dealers said. But
once shortages were filled, demand for shares effectively
dried up, they added.
   And Wall Street's early surge and then about-face took
London shares below Tuesday's closing level in the last
half-hour of trading, commentators said.
   "It was a nothing kind of day," said one London trader.
"Once short positions were covered up, there was really no
news to activate the market."
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
3.3 points to 2104.8. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
gained 6.8 points to 1622.5. Volume was 338 million shares,
down from 412.4 million shares Tuesday.
   U.K. trade figures were largely ignored, dealers said, in
favor of waiting for developments from the Middle East.
"Investors are watching the war zone and not economic data,"
said one commentator.
   Of the FT-SE 100 stocks, nearly 20 finished unchanged,
reflecting investors' reluctance to enter or remain in the
market, commentators said.
   Reuters closed at 789 pence, up 30 pence ($15.08, up 57
cents). The stock has lately been battered on a wave of heavy
U.S. selling amid one downgrading from a New York brokerage
firm. A total of 2.1 million shares changed hands.
   BICC rose 10 pence to 348 pence. The cables and
construction group reported a 7.5% rise in first-half pretax
profit, as strong growth in the core cable business offset
sluggishness at the home building unit.
   Composite insurance stocks were generally better, dealers
said, as dividend yields are beginning to look attractive to
investors at current price levels. Royal Insurance rose 5
pence to 414 pence, Sun Alliance gained 7 pence to 288 pence,
General Accident added 4 pence to 484 pence, while Guardian
Royal rose 3 pence to 198 pence.
   Commercial Union Assurance ended unchanged at 458 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt, and
Milan, lower in Brussels, Stockholm and Madrid, and mixed in
Amsterdam and Zurich. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Wellington.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
