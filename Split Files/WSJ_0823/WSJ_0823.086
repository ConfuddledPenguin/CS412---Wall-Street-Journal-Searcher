   LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge ordered Charles Keating,
the chairman of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent company, to
provide regulators with up-to-date financial statements, to
refrain from transferring any assets overseas and to give
regulators 48 hours notice before making any transaction
involving assets of more than $5,000.
   The order had been requested by the Office of Thrift
Supervision, which is trying to force Mr. Keating to return
$40.9 million to the failed S&amp;L as restitution. Mr. Keating
has maintained, however, that he is broke and hasn't
committed any wrongdoing.

   OTS officials said Mr. Keating is now required to provide
an accounting of his finances within five days. "From our
standpoint, we would characterize this as an absolute victory
for the American taxpayer," said Timothy Ryan, OTS director.
   Brad Boland, a spokesman for Mr. Keating, countered that
the chairman of American Continental Corp., of Phoenix,
Ariz., already had volunteered not to move assets out of the
country. He also asserted that federal regulators already
know what Mr. Keating's financial condition is. "They're out
chasing shadows," Mr. Boland said. "This is nothing more than
a waste of taxpayer dollars."
   Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif., was seized by the government
in April 1989, one day after parent American Continental
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson's ruling will remain
in force for 10 days, and he will rule next week if the order
should be continued in the form of a preliminary injunction.
