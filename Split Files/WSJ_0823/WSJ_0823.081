   NEW YORK -- A sharp jump in oil prices pounded stock
prices so hard that broad market indexes tumbled to their
lowest levels in more than a year.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43.81 points in
active trading to 2560.15, its low for the day but still
above the 1990 low set in January. But both Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite
index fell to their lowest levels since May 1989.

   Bond prices also fell sharply, pushing the yield on the
long-term U.S. Treasury bond to 9.05%, its highest level this
year. The dollar skidded against most major foreign
currencies amid a continuing flight to currencies of
countries with relatively high interest rates. The Swiss
franc continued to gain stature as the perceived safe-harbor
currency if war breaks out in the Mideast.
   Underlying the rise in oil prices to above $30 a barrel
and the drop in stocks was the increasing conviction among
investors that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will result in open
warfare.
   "The market believes there will be a shooting war,"
asserts Jack Solomon, market technician at Bear Stearns. "A
lot of people are saying stock prices will head straight
up" if war breaks out, but he isn't so sure. "War is such a
traumatic event, the market has to react no matter what," he
said.
   Buyers were notable by their absence yesterday, traders
said; even bargain-hunters stayed away. Kenneth Spence,
technical analyst at Salomon Brothers, noted that even
oil-service stocks such as Halliburton and Schlumberger got
hit in the sell-off.
   "Traders are taking profits where they have them," Mr.
Spence said, adding that the rise in the long-term bond yield
increased the selling pressure in stocks. As the yield rises
in bonds, stocks lose appeal for investors.
   Because of the impact of rising oil prices on the already
weak U.S. economy, Mr. Spence noted, "analysts are beginning
to downgrade their profit estimates for the third and fourth
quarters and for 1991."
   The dollar's weakness came largely on the strength of the
Swiss franc, which jumped to 1.2780 from 1.2917 against the
dollar.
   Bob Morrissey, senior currency trader at the Bank of
Boston, said the sinking stock market helped push the dollar
lower. "We're definitely on the brink of recession," he said,
"and we should see higher inflation. Because of that, we're
not seeing any kind of investment flows into the U.S."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell on volume of 175.6 million shares on the
Big Board, where declining issues far outnumbered advancers,
1,202 to 353.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5590 marks and 146.30 yen, compared with
1.5645 marks and 146.65 yen Tuesday.
