   Federal Judge Robert Aguilar was convicted yesterday of
illegally alerting a criminal target about a wiretap and then
lying about it to the FBI. Aside from this egregious
misconduct and crime by a judge, the lesson here for
prosecutors is: RICO does not pay. In March, an earlier jury
acquitted Judge Aguilar of one count and deadlocked on the
other counts, including one that would have declared that the
judge's actions somehow amounted to "racketeering."
Prosecutors dropped the RICO charge for this second trial,
with predictably better results.
