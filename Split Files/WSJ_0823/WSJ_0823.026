   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it intends
at some point to trade futures and futures options contracts
on the Soviet ruble.
   The futures exchange said such contracts couldn't begin
trading until the Soviet Union's currency was freely
convertible on world currency markets. The Merc didn't say
when it believes convertibility would be achieved and a
sufficient cash market developed to support futures trading.

   The new futures contracts also would require approval by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
