   LONDON -- The effort by the National Association of
Securities Dealers to extend its automated quotations
computerized trading network to London trading hours has hit
a regulatory snag, which could delay the planned September
start-up or even scuttle the plan.
   The proposal, a step toward global 24-hour trading, must
be cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, because
it involves predawn trading in the U.S. The hitch arises
because the SEC is pressing the new Nasdaq system to publish
U.S.-style market data, principally trade-by-trade price and
volume figures.

   Less stringent publication requirements have been proposed
by Nasdaq, which is striving to woo business in U.S. stocks
away from London's International Stock Exchange.
   The NASD fears that dealers in the relatively thin London
market, accustomed to reporting skimpier information, will
balk at using a program with American-style rules, Joseph R.
Hardiman, NASD president, said in a telephone interview from
Washington, D.C. The NASD is the self-regulator for the U.S.
over-the-counter market.
   The disagreement highlights a larger issue, as world stock
markets become increasingly entwined and U.S. markets expand
overseas: Can a system meeting tough U.S. regulations compete
with more lenient foreign systems? Or must a system be bent
to meet local custom?
   "Our job is to further the integrity of the marketplace
and protect investors," Kathryn Natale, the SEC's assistant
director for OTC matters, said in a phone interview from
Washington. "We've discussed our concerns with the NASD,
including real-time information -- or rather, the lack
thereof."
   Ms. Natale said it is "clearly within the realm of
possibility" that the SEC would allow the program to publish
less market data. But she added: "We don't know if that's the
best thing for markets today. We don't know if it's advisable
to take a step backward."
   Mr. Hardiman seemed to be setting the stage for a
compromise on the Nasdaq plan for a two-year pilot program,
saying the NASD might propose shortening the pilot period in
return for less strict disclosure requirements.
   As previously reported, the program would involve predawn
trading of more than 300 Nasdaq issues, mainly stocks of U.S.
companies, including about 70 that are listed on the London
stock exchange. The trading would start at 3:30 a.m. Eastern
time in the U.S., which is five time zones behind London.
   Traders said the NASD plan could be threatened from both
sides of the Atlantic. They doubt that London traders and
customers would use the program if it required U.S.-type
disclosure. And they said that without such disclosure, it
might be illegal for certain U.S. fiduciaries to participate
-- mainly pension funds, which operate under the federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
   Mr. Hardiman is hopeful that the SEC will see things the
NASD's way. "Commission members recognize the need for U.S.
markets to be competitive world-wide," he said. But he added
that because of the discussions with the SEC, "We may not get
started in September." And he indicated the program might be
dropped if the SEC rules against Nasdaq and dealers boycott
the system, saying rhetorically, "We can bring up the best
system in the world, but if no one commits their capital. . .
."
   Under the NASD plan, Nasdaq would collect from dealers all
price and volume data on each trade, storing it for
surveillance purposes. But rather than report individual
trade data on Nasdaq's ticker in the U.S., the NASD would
issue periodic quotes and volume information, said J. Lynton
Jones, the NASD's London-based executive director for Europe.
   Mr. Hardiman explained: "It's not like in the U.S., where
you have 50 dealers trading Apple Computer. In the U.K., you
have maybe two or three in most stocks, and people can
quickly sense what the position of a competitor is."
   Actually, the Nasdaq plan would offer London dealers
slower disclosure than that provided by the London exchange
for British stocks. The London exchange's ticker reports
British trades with a three-minute delay, except for large
trades, which are reported after 90 minutes. But there isn't
any organized market data system now for U.S. stocks traded
on the London exchange.
