   BICC PLC of Britain reported a 7.5% rise in first-half
pretax profit to #100 million ($191.2 million) -- the top of
analysts' estimates -- from #93 million a year earlier, as
strong growth in the company's core cable business offset
sluggishness at its home building unit.
   Profit after taxes and minority interests, or profit
attributable to shareholders, increased 16% to #59 million
from #51 million. Per-share earnings rose 1.9% to 21.8 pence
from 21.4 pence. The year-earlier results included an
extraordinary loss of #1 million; the latest period didn't
have any special items.
