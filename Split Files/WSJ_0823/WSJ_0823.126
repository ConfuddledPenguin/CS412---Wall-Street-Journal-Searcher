   PRINCETON, N.J. -- The David Sarnoff Research Center said
it and two major electronics companies were awarded a $7.7
million contract from the Defense Department to develop a
high-resolution video workstation.
   The new workstation, which would combine capabilities for
handling text, video and graphics in a high-powered computer,
will be developed by the Sarnoff Center along with Sun
Microsystems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., and Texas
Instruments Inc., Dallas. The Sarnoff Center is a unit of SRI
International, a contract-based research and consulting firm
based in Menlo Park, Calif.

   The military would likely use such a computer as a
building block for "combat information systems," a Sarnoff
spokesman said. He said the basic technology would also have
numerous commercial uses, including video teleconferencing
and medical imaging.
   Separately, the Sarnoff Center said it was awarded a $3
million contract for a supercomputer dedicated to processing
video information.
   Both awards, administered through the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, were originally announced last
October, but no dollar amounts were specified at that time.
