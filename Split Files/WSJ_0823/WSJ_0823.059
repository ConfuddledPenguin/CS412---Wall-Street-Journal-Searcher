   NEW YORK -- An Illinois state trial-court judge blocked
the former chief executive officer of GTE Airfone Inc. from
competing with the company's airplane-based phone service.
   John D. Goeken, who founded Airfone and eventually sold it
to GTE Corp., has been fighting a legal battle with the
telecommunications giant to set up a rival service since
leaving Airfone in early 1989.

   Judge John W. Darrah of the Circuit Court of Du Page
County, Ill., ruled that Mr. Goeken was bound by a
non-compete agreement that he signed with GTE and its Airfone
subsidiary.
   William J. Gordon, vice president of regulatory affairs
for Goeken Group, said Mr. Goeken will appeal the ruling on
the ground that Airfone voided his original employment
contract by "usurping his authority as chief executive" when
he ran Airfone.
   "GTE wants everybody to think that Jack Goeken's on the
ropes," said Mr. Gordon. "That's the wrong message to be
sending to the airlines {since} GTE has a monopoly right now
with almost every airline under contract."
   GTE said in a statement that it was "pleased that Mr.
Goeken's non-competition covenant has been upheld . . . and
is not contrary to the public interest."
   Airfone had been operating under an experimental license
since 1984 and has installed air-to-ground phones in more
than 1,300 aircraft, or about a third of the U.S. airlines'
domestic fleet.
   In April, the Federal Communications Commission formally
established a service that enables airline passengers to make
phone calls during flights and opened the field to potential
competitors, including Mr. Goeken's planned In-Flight Phone
offering.
