   Pioneer Electronic Corp. of Japan will postpone the
domestic sale of its digital audiotape, or DAT, recorders,
initially scheduled to start in Japan this autumn, a
spokesman said, citing the company's concerns about copyright
protection problems involved with DAT recording.
   He declined to specify the company's plans or to say when
the technology will be made available on the domestic market,
but said Pioneer will continue to study possible marketing of
the DAT recorder. Unlike analog tape recordings, digital
recordings deteriorate very little; thus, record makers fear
that DAT machines could result in a virtually endless stream
of high-quality copies that could cut into their sales. The
spokesman also said introduction of DAT decks domestically
could threaten favorable sales of Pioneer's compact disk
players.

   Japanese companies started selling DAT recorders after the
government adopted a new standard last May that limits a
user's ability to make copies of CD and other digital
recordings.
