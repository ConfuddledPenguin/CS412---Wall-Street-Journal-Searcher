   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc., caving into a
dissident shareholder group, agreed to put its itself and its
sole operating unit on the block.
   The company, which a month ago lost several key board
seats to Centaur Partners Group, said its board would
evaluate proposals to sell itself and its FoxMeyer Corp.
unit, a $2.3 billion wholesale drug distributor. The company
said it has received "indications of interest" regarding
FoxMeyer within the past six weeks but declined to elaborate.
Following the announcement, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. put about
$257 million of the company's debt on its Credit-Watch list,
indicating a possible raising or lowering of its credit
rating.

   The decision to consider selling FoxMeyer marks a victory
for the company's largest shareholder, Centaur, which has a
16.5% stake. Centaur, which began acquiring National
Intergroup stock last November, criticized management for
seven consecutive years of operating losses and advocated a
complete liquidation to enhance shareholder value. Although
Centaur won only three of 10 board seats at last month's
annual meeting, more than two-thirds of shareholders favored
its slate, giving the group what it termed "a clear mandate"
for its program. Yesterday's announcement was also a defeat
for Howard M. Love, who National Intergroup said was
succeeded as chairman by director Buck Mickel. Mr. Love, who
lost his board seat in the proxy fight, will serve as chief
executive officer of the company until his planned retirement
on March 31, 1991.
   Mr. Love long maintained that shareholders wouldn't
realize FoxMeyer's potential value by selling it now.
Although lagging the performance of other drug distributors,
FoxMeyer has been improving and reported a 40% surge in
operating earnings and a 23% sales rise in the first quarter
ended June 30.
   Centaur has estimated that FoxMeyer, with its 11
distribution centers, could fetch between $475 million and
$525 million, or at least $21 a share. In composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, National Intergroup closed at
$16.125, up $1.50.
   Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer,
Pittsburgh, believes FoxMeyer is valued at at least $25 a
share. He noted that the drug distribution business is
growing at double digit rates and that FoxMeyer recently
landed a major account to supply pharmaceuticals to the fast
growing Phar-Mor drug chain.
   Still, finding a buyer may prove difficult, he said. The
large drug distribution businesses, such as McKesson Corp.
and Bergen Brunswig Corp., might be precluded from acquiring
FoxMeyer -- the nation's fourth largest drug wholesaler --
because of antitrust considerations.
   The board apparently agreed to explore a sale, after
realizing Centaur wouldn't relent and that a lengthy fight
could jeopardize the FoxMeyer operations.
   "We believe that growing FoxMeyer is the best way to
maximize the value for shareholders but some people believe
there's greater value in a sale," a company spokeswoman said.
"The board decided to find out."
   Centaur said it "is gratified that the board has moved in
a manner consistent with the clear shareholder mandate."
   National Intergroup has also agreed to pay Centaur $4.2
million, representing a portion of Centaur's proxy expenses.
In addition, the company and Centaur agreed to dismiss
proxy-related lawsuits.
   Separately National Intergroup increased the size of its
board to 12, adding FoxMeyer President Robert L. King and
Centaur partner Abbey J. Butler.
