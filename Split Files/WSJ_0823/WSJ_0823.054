   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has brought into sharp focus the
need by the U.S. to limit its dependence on Mideast oil. If
the U.S. is to continue electrifying the nontransportation
energy sector and insulating itself from the vagaries of
politics in the Persian Gulf and other hot spots, rapid
growth in applying nuclear energy, an economically and
environmentally sound alternative threatened by domestic
politics, must continue. This is particularly true if the
Clean Air Act is signed into law.
   Over the past 20 years, the increased use of nuclear
energy and coal in the production of electricity has
gradually weaned Americans from over-dependence on oil in the
non-transportation sector. (Unfortunately, the transportation
sector is liquid-fuel-dependent and has increased its
petroleum consumption by more than 20% since the first oil
embargo in 1973.) While total energy requirements have
increased 13.6% since 1973, oil consumption has decreased 40%
in homes and small businesses and 10% in factories -- despite
an increase in economic output of more than 50%.

   While petroleum use was declining in these sectors,
electricity usage increased by 67% and 33%, respectively.
This improved life styles, spurred economic growth, increased
energy efficiency, and decreased exposure to the Saddam
Husseins of the world.
   And where was this electricity coming from? Between 1973
and 1989, electricity production from nuclear power increased
525% and from coal 84%. Though petroleum usage by utilities
has recently turned up, it is still less than half its 1973
level.
   With economic growth in the 1990s generally forecast to
average between 2.5% and 3% a year, the Department of Energy,
Edison Electric Institute and other recognized authorities
are forecasting electricity demand to increase at similar
rates. At 3% growth, approximately 180,000 megawatts of new
generating capacity are required in addition to that which is
under construction and for which firm planning commitments
exist; if growth averages 2.5%, 140,000 megawatts are
required. This is equivalent to 140 to 180 large power
plants. These needs exclude the possibility that some 60,000
megawatts of aging fossil-fired plants may need to be
retired. If we are not to increase the use of oil, this
leaves coal, natural gas, and solar and nuclear power as
alternatives.
   The Clean Air bill (now in conference committee, versions
having passed the Senate and the House) would sharply cut
coal's ability to meet these increased power needs. According
to the act, sulfur dioxide emissions must be reduced by more
than half, to 8.9 million tons a year by the year 2001.
Nitrogen oxides are also to be halved, to 2.5 million tons a
year.
   The Edison Electric Institute estimates the annual cost of
compliance to be $5 billion to $7 billion. This will increase
electricity rates by about 6%; but in regions that burn high
sulfur coal, the increase could be as high as 20%. Some 250
existing power plants will be affected. Operating costs at
some plants could increase by as much as 50%, leading to
closure of the plants. Other plants will see degraded
operations and lower efficiency. Also, new clean coal power
production technologies may not be available until around the
year 2000. Thus, maintaining electricity output from coal
power plants will be a daunting task, much less increasing
production to meet growth in electricity use.
   Natural gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, and
except for modest imports from Canada, it is produced
domestically. But, until now, natural gas has been used by
electric utilities in power plants that operate only during
periods of peak power demand. Only where natural gas could be
reliably accessed in large quantities, such as on the Gulf
Coast, is it used to meet day in, day out electricity needs.
In the rest of the country, obtaining a natural gas contract
that guarantees firm delivery at a stable price for periods
of 10 years or more is difficult to nearly impossible. Thus,
using natural gas to meet the bulk of the electricity needs
identified earlier entails significant business risks.
   These risks will probably increase, in part due to the
Clean Air Act. First, the demand for natural gas among
industrial customers will increase as they reduce their use
of dirtier-burning oil and coal. Second, natural gas and oil
prices are aligned because of their direct substitutability.
If oil prices continue their recent rise, gas prices will
follow. Third, there is a delivery problem because pipeline
capacity needs to be expanded, to move gas farther and to
deliver it to power plants.
   Solar, biomass and other renewable forms of energy are not
yet practical on the scale needed to satisfy the increased
electricity needs the U.S. will experience in the 1990s. In
1989 these forms of energy satisfied less than 0.5% of total
U.S. electricity requirements, and, according to Energy
Department figures, no growth in output has occurred since
1985.
   Therefore, by the process of elimination, the U.S. should
be headed down the path of increased use of nuclear power.
Last year, nuclear power plants generated 19.1% of U.S.
electricity requirements. If these plants had not been
operating, an additional 275 million tons of coal or 800
million barrels of oil would have been burned. Sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxides emissions would have been five million
tons and two million tons higher, respectively, and our oil
import bill would bave been some $5 billion higher.
   The U.S. has realized significant benefits from its
investment in nuclear energy. Cumulative cost savings from
operating nuclear vs. fossil power plants exceed $40 billion
since about 1970. Also, using cost assumptions contained in
the proposed Clean Air Act, the cumulative value of reduced
emissions resulting from nuclear plant operations is
estimated to be more than $80 billion. In addition, according
to the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, since 1973 nuclear
energy has displaced four billion barrels of oil, saving $115
billion on our import bill.
   Other unquantified benefits include the fact that nuclear
power plants emit no particulates. They do not produce noise.
They do not require large numbers of wells or mines to
produce fuel or barges, pipelines or trains to transport it.
Also, nuclear fuel wastes can be stored at compact locations.
Given concerns over oil spills, refinery explosions and
despoiled lands, these are benefits worth acknowledging.
   But perhaps the largest benefit is that a vibrant nuclear
power program helps provide us with the will to deal with
thugs like Saddam Hussein. The U.S. has taken the lead in
organizing the world to thwart additional acts of aggression
and butchery by him. The leadership might have been less
forthcoming if our non-transportation sectors were dependent
on Persian Gulf oil.
   Unfortunately, just as a new wave of nuclear power plant
construction should be starting, it is stagnant. As a result,
oil consumption by the utilities, which had been declining
for years, recently turned up -- increasing by 32% since
1987.
   Much of the blame for this resides with short-sighted
federal and state regulatory policies. Of greatest immediacy,
state rate regulators must encourage, not thwart, utility
investment in nuclear energy (the Shoreham plant's experience
in New York state is perhaps the most egregious example);
federal regulators must stop dawdling with regard to
licensing new nuclear plant designs; and the Energy
Department must effectively manage the nuclear fuel waste
storage program, for which it is responsible (a program
funded by the nuclear utility industry).
   The commercial nuclear industry must also take agressive
action, including improving the industry's spotty operating
record. While all U.S. nuclear plants are safe and operations
improved dramatically in the 1980s, there are still plants
that under-perform, and they always make the headlines. The
nuclear industry must also be more aggressive in stating the
need for new plants and planning for their installation. In a
word, leadership is required.
   In the late 1970s, Carter administration policy called for
nuclear power to be "the energy option of last resort." This
unfortunate and inept policy still manifests itself in how
the nuclear industry is regulated and perceived. It must be
immediately reversed. Failure to do so risks undermining our
most fundamental political values.
