   MUNICH, West Germany -- Wolfgang Schieren's team had
strict orders to refer to the target only by the code name
"Red."
   That is how the chief executive of West German insurance
giant Allianz Versicherungs AG hoped to keep his competitors
from discovering that he was about to gobble up Fireman's
Fund Insurance Co.

   But now, after finally announcing that he is buying the
U.S. insurer for $3.3 billion, Mr. Schieren is under pressure
to show that his acquisition was worth all the mystery.
   The acquisition has stirred comment among critics who
contend that Allianz may be paying too much for Fireman's.
Moreover, the move comes at a time when Europe's largest
insurance group is already stretched thin from a variety of
new undertakings, including a majority stake in East
Germany's former insurance monopoly and a joint venture in
Hungary.
   While no one questions the Munich-based group's ability to
bankroll its activities, the integration of Fireman's Fund is
shaping up as the ultimate test of Allianz's aspiration to
become a global insurance giant.
   Allianz's strength begins at home. After World War II,
Allianz quickly grew to four times the size of its closest
domestic competitor, capturing 14% of the German market for
life insurance and 16% of that for non-life insurance. The
group also boasts a central position within the German
economy, owing partly to its 25% cross-holding with
Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG, one of the world's largest
reinsurers, and a tight web of boardroom and equity ties to
German companies and banks.
   Allianz has 223 subsidiaries world-wide and posted
consolidated group net profits in 1989 of 1.16 billion marks
($740.8 million).
   This may help to explain the calm confidence of Mr.
Schieren, who joined Allianz as a salesman in 1956 and has a
reputation as a hard-driving competitor. Speaking in his
office overlooking the leafy expanses of Munich's English
Garden, the 63-year-old executive insists that the group will
have no trouble absorbing the new ventures, including
Fireman's Fund. He concedes, however, that Allianz is
entering a "consolidation phase," rather than a period of
continued rapid expansion.
   Mr. Schieren's global strategy is simple. He envisions a
world insurance market with three big prizes -- the U.S.,
Europe and Asia -- and he has set his sights on gaining
leading positions in all three. With Allianz's deep pockets
and the long-term outlook necessary to ride out most
financial storms, its prospects for achieving its goals are
good.
   But with so much coming together at once, some observers
wonder whether Allianz may have taken on more than it can
handle. The 270 million mark acquisition of a majority stake
in East Germany's former state-run insurance monopoly is
expected to cost Allianz dearly -- perhaps two billion marks
over the first three to five years. Allianz is also planning
to expand its stake in the French group Via/Rhin &amp; Moselle,
the insurance subsidiary of Cie. de Navigation Mixte, to 65%
from 50%.
   The group's efforts to enter the largest Asian market,
Japan, are all but stalled. Allianz is indirectly active in
Japan through its control of Britain's Cornhill Insurance
PLC, but is experiencing Japanese bureaucratic delays in
receiving permission to establish a full subsidiary.
   Europe is Allianz's big success story -- and the one
market that is helping to define strategies for the group's
expansion elsewhere. Mr. Schieren, who took over the top job
at Allianz in 1971, led the group's foreign-buying campaign.
Allianz is the second-largest insurer in Italy and Austria,
and a fast-rising power in France and Spain.
   Having conquered Europe, it was only a matter of time
before Mr. Schieren found a U.S. company that suited his
needs.
   The U.S. market carries plenty of risk for Allianz. Even
before the latest signs of weakening in the U.S. economy, the
insurance sector was caught in a prolonged slump, with the
outlook for the property-casualty business especially bleak.
And profits in the U.S. insurance market have been squeezed
by the sort of bare-knuckle competition that few Europeans
experience on their home turf.
   Until now, Allianz was represented in the U.S. by six
smaller subsidiaries, covering only 20 states. With Fireman's
Fund, Allianz will be represented in all 50 states. It will
also gain a business that is 80% commercial -- a crucial
element, since commercial insurance is the area Mr. Schieren
is developing as a global specialty.
   Fireman's Fund, based in Novato, Calif., is ranked 15th in
the world in terms of premiums, which last year totaled $3.4
billion.
   Mr. Schieren is convinced that the U.S. market remains a
good investment, regardless of the current problems, which he
sees as part of a normal business cycle.
   Friedrich Schiefer, the Allianz board member in charge of
finance, says that by concentrating on commercial lines and
taking advantage of Allianz's know-how, Fireman's Fund should
start expanding its volume of business in the next five to 10
years and should realize average pretax earnings of $250
million a year over the next half decade.
   But nagging questions about Fireman's Fund remain. In
recent years the company has heavily retrenched, selling off
its operations in Asia and pumping money into reserves for
future claims on health-liability and general-liability
business written on its books at the beginning of the 1980s.
The company has seen its premiums and market share shrink for
the last three years in a row, and it performed below
industry averages for the last five.
   Mr. Schieren maintains that the restructuring has left
Fireman's Fund leaner and healthier -- and a more attractive
acquisition.
   Allianz also sees benefits for itself in the structure of
the acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, Allianz
will hand over $3.3 billion in cash for 100% of the insurance
stock held by Fireman's parent, Fund American Cos. Fund
American will then buy back $2.2 billion of non-insurance
equities now linked to Fireman's Fund, including oil and gas
holdings. The $2.2 billion in cash will go back into
Fireman's Fund to build up its reserves. "In one move, we're
free," says Mr. Schieren. "We have money in our hands, and we
can use it to buy what we want to buy."
   Mr. Schieren makes no secret that he is glad to be rid of
the non-insurance equities. In the future, he says, the
asset-management policy of Fireman's Fund will more closely
reflect the conservative approach of its West German owners.
The present management of Fireman's Fund, however, will stay
in place.
   Allianz officials insist that, by all standard measures,
they are paying the right amount for Fireman's Fund. One rule
of thumb, for example, is that one dollar of premium should
roughly equal one dollar of sale price. In these terms, the
$3.3 billion price tag-compared with the company's $3.4
billion of premium incomeseems on target.
   However, critics of the deal argue that two factors -- the
sluggish U.S. market and the mixed performance of Fireman's
Fund -- still make the price relatively hefty. "It looks as
though Allianz is paying full price for a company just
because they wanted to be big in the U.S.," says one industry
analyst.
   This isn't the first time Allianz has been accused of
paying too much for a foreign acquisition. In 1979, some
observers contended that the company had "overpaid and
overstretched itself" when it bought North American Life &amp;
Casualty Co. and Fidelity Union Life Insurance Co. for more
than $500 million. Both companies now make solid profits.
   The same has happened with many of Allianz's European
acquisitions, helping to reinforce the notion that Allianz
has a magic touch when it comes to picking out and grooming
long-term winners.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Schieren, who plans to retire in 1992,
remains confident that he can wield his magic touch in all
his new ventures. The acquisition of Fireman's Fund must
still get approval from regulators, but this isn't expected
to pose any problem, and the deal could be concluded as early
as next January.
   Although an investigation by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission into possible insider-trading activity in
connection with the Fireman's Fund acquisition is continuing,
it is unlikely to have any impact on the sale. The SEC is
looking into unusually heavy trading in Fund American stock
and options in the days before Allianz announced the
acquisition of Fireman's Fund.
   "The leak certainly couldn't have come from here," says
Mr. Schieren, adding that "not even my trusted secretary"
knew the name of the company involved in the negotiations.
