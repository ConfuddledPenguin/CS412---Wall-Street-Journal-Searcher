   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- If there was any doubt in the
minds of Americans or Iraqis, President Bush's mobilization
of military reserves ought to eliminate it: The U.S. is
prepared to fight, not just to posture, in the Persian Gulf.
   Mr. Bush's decision yesterday to activate thousands of
reservists has military importance, of course. The U.S., in
the post-Vietnam era, has structured its armed forces to rely
more than ever on citizen-soldiers, who perform some of the
more obscure but important technical tasks needed to give
support to large-scale fighting units.

   But the move is more important for the psychological
impact it is likely to have, particularly on the American
public. As doctors, lawyers and mechanics from towns and
cities across America vacate their jobs to go into active
service, Americans who may have been considering war in the
Middle East a hypothetical idea will get a clear message that
it is a real possibility -- and one that could affect them
directly.
   "The message in calling up the reserves is, `We're playing
for real,'" says pollster Peter Hart. "It's one thing when
isolated events are going on in another part of the world,
but this absolutely will bring it home much more."
   Adds retired Admiral Thomas Moorer, a former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff: "It has an impact on the community
when people see that a fellow they know at the bank is no
longer there."
   And that raises the political stakes for Mr. Bush, who is
ordering the first activation of reservists in a military
crisis since the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam. (Reservists
and National Guardsmen also were called up to serve as postal
workers during a 1970 postal strike.) Mr. Bush is likely to
enjoy at least a brief, rally-around-the-flag surge of
support as he calls on American citizens to help protect
American interests in the Persian Gulf.
   The rise of patriotic sentiment may even help quell any
complaints about the Middle East mission in Congress, where,
after all, 13 members are themselves members of the reserves
or the National Guard. "It makes it much tougher to quibble
or natter at a president who shows his will and his
resources," says James Cannon, who was an aide in the Ford
White House and later a Senate staffer.
   But the political risks are enormous over the long haul.
If fighting breaks out and reservists become casualties, the
impact will hit even closer to home than if full-time
soldiers alone were involved.
   "I think the call-up further engenders support for the
president's actions," says retired Rear Admiral Gene La
Rocque, a former commander of the USS Saratoga. "But as soon
as the shooting starts, the bottom for the support is going
to fall out."
   The reserve mobilization may also send a chilling signal
that this will be no quick strike, as the U.S. has lately
conducted against Panama, Grenada and Libya. "It raises the
question if this might not be a long-term commitment," says
pollster Stanley Greenberg, "and there is no doubt that any
sign that this is going to be protracted will produce a lot
of anxiety."
   And even if the standoff with Iraq drags on without
fighting, "this goes from a positive to a negative," says
David Keene, a conservative political activist. "People will
want to bring (the reservists) home. And our coalition with
our allies will fall apart. People will want to know, why
aren't regulars from Europe there? Why these reservists?"
   The reserve activation came as President Bush appeared to
back down slightly on one front of his confrontation with
Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein, which has been building since
Iraqi soldiers overran Kuwait Aug. 2. Mr. Bush told reporters
that he may be prepared to wait a few days before ordering
U.S. ships to stop more tankers and freighters carrying Iraqi
goods, giving the United Nations time to enact a resolution
explicitly authorizing military action to enforce the
international trade sanctions imposed on Iraq. The Soviet
Union is urging the U.S. to give the U.N. more time to
authorize a naval blockade, Mr. Bush implied.
   At the same time, Jordan's King Hussein announced that he
is heading to Iraq to attempt a peace-making diplomatic
mission. But American officials are growing increasingly
worried that a flashpoint in the tense standoff could be
reached on Friday, when Iraq has ordered foreign embassies in
occupied Kuwait to close down. The U.S. and other Western
nations intend to defy the order.
   The impact of the call-up will be greatly influenced by
how big it becomes. Neither President Bush nor Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney will say precisely how many reservists
will be activated, and other aides say the administration
will remain vague abut the numbers to give the president more
flexibility to call up even more people as time goes.
   But the administration insists the number of reservists
activated won't approach the 200,000 Mr. Bush is authorized
to activate for 180 days without congressional approval.
Initially, a call-up of 40,000 is more likely. The White
House says that those called will be people with specialized
skills needed in the massive movement of troops to Saudi
Arabia, such as food and water handlers, doctors and nurses,
construction specialists and cargo handlers.
   "Selected units will be called up as they are needed and
when they are needed," says Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   For the time being, economists don't expect any
significant economic effect. Even if the president activated
100,000 reservists, "you're talking about less than one-tenth
of one percent of the labor force," says Lawrence Chimerine,
a fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington.
"There are others there to take their place."
   As the tension continues, Mr. Bush's decision to turn to
military reservists means he has decided to employ a military
tool that recent presidents have been reluctant to use.
Politicians like to keep the pain of war as far removed from
the general populace as possible, so the reserves often have
been kept at arm's length.
   In Vietnam, for instance, rather than call on reservists,
the Pentagon used draftees to fill out empty units even
though those specialties already existed in the guard and the
reserves.
   In fact, in recent decades the reserves have been called
on more often to intervene in American domestic disputes than
foreign hostilities. President Kennedy called on the reserves
and National Guard three times to quell civil-rights
tensions, in addition to activating them during the Berlin
Wall and Cuban missile crises. And President Johnson used
reservists once during civil-rights disturbances.
   A small National Guard unit from Missouri consisting of
about 40 soldiers was undergoing routine training during the
invasion of Panama and was pressed into service there --
guarding a prisoner of war compound. But in general, the last
time the country relied heavily on the reserves in a conflict
was when President Truman called up hundreds of thousands
during the Korean War.
   Today, because of changes in the American military
structure, it would be nearly impossible to maintain the kind
of big and far-flung military operation the U.S. is mounting
in the Persian Gulf without some help from the reserves.
   After the abolition of the draft in 1973, the Pentagon
switched to what it calls a "Total Force Policy" that relies
more on part-time soldiers. Under this system, many support
jobs essential in wartime were turned over in large part to
the reserves.
   In endorsing this policy in the 1970s, Congress had
politics as well as military efficiency in mind. Lawmakers
figured that if a president were forced in a time of
hostilities to turn quickly to the use of reserves, he would
have to find out early whether a conflict had widespread
popular support. Use of reservists and National Guardsmen,
lawmakers calculated, would reduce the chances of another
Vietnam War.
   So now, 98% of the army's lawyers are reservists. Some of
them may be called on to handle the legal technicalities of
calling on other reservists. Adm. Moorer says Pentagon
acquaintances have told him that "they've called in
reservists to work on procedures to call up other
reservists."
   In addition, 87% of the army's psychological-warfare
specialists and many of its hospital units are in the
reserves. And, particularly important in a showdown with Iraq
and its chemical-weapons capability, 66% of the army's
chemical-warfare and related specialists are in the reserves.
   And some military specialists think that the Pentagon may
also need technicians who work with weapons. On aircraft
carriers, for instance, pilots make practice runs using live
ammunition only once a year, Adm. Moorer says. In actual
conflict those pilots might make two bombing runs a day,
vastly increasing the need for support people to handle bombs
and fuzes. In the U.S., reservists can replace weapons
specialists stationed here to free them to go oversees, or
the reservists might be sent directly to the Persian Gulf.
   For now, the administration officials insist that they
haven't decided specifically which of these kinds of
specialists will be called upon, or which proportion will
fill in at U.S. bases as opposed to going overseas. Mr.
Cheney says that he will get recommendations today from the
military services on how many and what kind of reservists
they want to call.
   Administration aides say the call-up is likely to involve
almost entirely the military reserves, though they also say
that some National Guard troops could be called in to fill
holes. In fact, some Air National Guard planes and crews
already have been up in the air to help in the airlift to
Saudi Arabia, having volunteered with their governors'
permission to fly cargo and supplying in-flight refueling for
regular forces heading for Saudi Arabia.
   Whatever the precise size of the call-up, it seems likely
to reach only a small fraction of America's enormous reserve
forces. The overall "Ready Reserve" totals some 580,000
troops -- 310,000 Army reservists, 81,000 Air Force, 147,000
Navy and 44,000 Marines.
   The Army National Guard has another 550,000 soldiers, and
the Air National Guard 112,000.
   It's always been particularly dicey to commit Guard units
to combat. Units tend to be filled with young men and women
from the same communities. If one of these units were wiped
out, an entire community would suffer. Besides, though
guardsmen vehemently disagree, Pentagon professionals often
consider Guard units to be less primed than regular units.
   For now, Americans clearly support the turn to the
reservists. In this week's Wall Street Journal/NBC News news
poll, 79% of the public backed calling up National Guard
reserves and only 17% opposed it. This support was pervasive
across all regional, political and generational lines. For
example, voters between the ages of 18 and 34 -- those most
affected by a call-up -- supported calling up reserves by a
76%-to-21% margin.
   And there was immediate congressional support as well.
"This is a very capable force and should be used in the
emergency in the Middle East," said Rep. G.V. (Sonny)
Montgomery, a Mississippi Democrat who is a senior member of
the House Armed Services Committee and a retired major
general in the National Guard. Rep. Montgomery, a close
friend of President Bush, wrote to the president last week to
urge the action.
   "Congress has been pushing for a number of years to
build-up the National Guard and Reserve," Rep. Montgomery
said in a statement. "We have given them first-line equipment
and training. They are ready to respond to this challenge."
   Those sentiments were echoed by another influential
Democrat, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn
of Georgia. He was the principal author of the 1976 law that
allows the president to call up reservists.
   "My intent was to deal with the type of situation we have
in the Persian Gulf, where reservists are needed for a
limited period and can be activated without a formal
declaration of war or national emergency," Sen. Nunn said in
a statement.
   Because of the political risks involved, White House aides
don't want the reserve call-up to grow too large. They've
played down suggestions from Pentagon officials that the
call-up may approach the 200,000 allowed under the law. White
House chief of staff John Sununu has pointedly said that the
call-up would be "surgical" and "fine-tuned."
   But psychologically, the call-up is likely to have an
impact on Main Street whatever its precise size -- and that
may actually suit the administration's purposes. "In the
short term calling up the reserves underscores the
seriousness of the crisis," says Mr. Keene, the Republican
conservative activist. "And I presume this is what Bush is
trying to do."
