   TAYLOR, Mich. -- Masco Industries Inc. said it could take
a pretax charge of as much as $20 million, or 15 cents a
share after taxes, against its second-half earnings, as a
result of General Motors Corp.'s scrapping a joint program to
develop the Chevrolet Beretta convertible.
   Masco Industries' Cars &amp; Concepts subsidiary had been
jointly working with GM's Chevrolet division to develop the
convertible Beretta. A GM spokesman said the planned 1990
model originally was to be introduced in May, when it was
used as the pace car in the Indianapolis 500. But because of
delays, the car still hasn't reached the market.

   "Based on our analysis of the convertible market and the
size and price range, we concluded that a sufficient
opportunity to market the Beretta convertible profitably no
longer existed," the GM spokesman said. "For that reason we
have discontinued the project."
   Masco Industries said it "will pursue recovery of its
investment" in the project, but added that "recovery is
uncertain."
   Masco Industries, a manufacturer of custom engineering
components and specialty products, generates about 50% of its
annual revenue from auto-related contracts.
   Despite the possible write-off, the company "still expects
to be profitable in the second half," said Richard Manoogian,
Masco Industries' chairman and president.
   Masco's first-half net income was down 64% from the
year-earlier period, to $17.8 million, or 23 cents a share.
The decline was largely the result of a decline in U.S. car
and truck production, Mr. Manoogian said.
