   The utility also agreed to pay the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources as much as $500,000 annually in
monitoring costs.
   "There's some suspicions there might be problems," he
said. "We've agreed to conduct a study of our facilities, and
if we find any problems, we'll clean it up."
