   A nearly forgotten law that allows servicemen to reduce
interest rates on consumer loans has become a hot topic in
the military in recent days and is causing concern in the
banking community.
   The law, part of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief
Act of 1940, allows individuals in the armed services to
limit the interest rates they pay on credit cards, car,
student and other personal loans to 6% as long as the debts
were incurred before they joined the military. The provision
gives reservists who are called to active duty the same
benefits.

   No one knows why the obscure provision has suddenly come
to the attention of servicemen. But as the Persian Gulf
conflict escalates and thousands of reservists are called up,
banking lawyers are worrying about the scope of the law's
impact.
   The American Banker, which first reported the concern over
the law, said no one is sure how many loans might be
affected. But Laurence E. Platt, a Washington, D.C., attorney
who represents consumer banks, speculates that if tens of
thousands of reservists are called to active service as
President Bush has proposed, "it's going to be a major
problem" for banks. "My clients tell me their phones are
ringing off the hook," he said.
   Mr. Platt says these reservists are typically older than
most enlisted personnel and are thus more likely to have
taken out loans. They are probably paying interests rates
ranging from 10% for mortgages to 18% for credit-card loans,
Mr. Platt says.
   The potential problem for the banks is that the law
doesn't require the federal government to compensate them for
the money lost from the interest-rate reduction. Mr. Platt
says that banks now may attack the law as taking of property
without just compensation, which is barred by the Fifth
Amendment.
   But Mark Burneko, spokesman for the American Bankers
Association in Washington, which represents about 10,000
banks, says, "We tend to believe the overall effect will be
slight."
   Mr. Burneko says the association's lawyers believe
borrowers will have to show that they suffered a financial
hardship because they left their higher-paid, private-sector
jobs for the military. But Mr. Burneko says he thinks that
proving financial hardship will be difficult because the
reservists probably won't see lengthy action and because the
salary gap between the private sector and the military isn't
as wide as it used to be.
   Mr. Platt, however, says he believes the law places the
burden of disproving financial hardship on the lender, which
will have to take the borrower to court. All the borrowers
have to do is apply for the reduction, and Mr. Platt says
that began happening 10 days ago.
   The interest-rate provision of the law hasn't been
updated. When the law was passed 50 years ago, a 4% interest
rate was the norm. Congress, Mr. Platt says, intended only to
prevent banks from boosting rates above 6%.
   A spokesman for the House Committee on Veterans Affairs
says the panel is reviewing the law with an eye toward
updating it.
