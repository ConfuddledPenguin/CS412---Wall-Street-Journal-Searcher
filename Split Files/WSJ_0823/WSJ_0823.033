   WASHINGTON -- Rep. Newt Gingrich, the second-ranking House
Republican, further complicated deficit-reduction talks by
calling for tax cuts rather than tax increases.
   The Georgian, who is a budget summit negotiator, said
yesterday that he is putting together a package of tax cuts
that will include a reduction in the rate on capital gains
and, perhaps, a cut in the Social Security payroll tax. The
aim is to stimulate the economy at a time when it appears on
the verge of recession, he said.

   Previously, Rep. Gingrich had expressed more willingness
to increase taxes to help reduce the budget deficit. A
spokesman said, "He is still in favor of the summit process
and reaching the targets."
   Still, his latest statement is yet another reminder that
Mr. Gingrich and the House Republicans he represents are
stalwarts against a tax increase. That position is yet
another obstacle to reaching a fiscal 1991 budget accord,
which would include tax increases and spending restraints.
