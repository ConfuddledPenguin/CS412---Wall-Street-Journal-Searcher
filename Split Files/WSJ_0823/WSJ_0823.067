   NEW YORK -- A management shake-up at CBS News appears
imminent and may ultimately result in the ouster of news
division President David W. Burke after two tumultuous years
of clashes with top management and a deepening ratings slide
for CBS's nightly newscast.
   Two individuals at CBS Inc. said that the shake-up could
be announced as early as today, and that at the very least,
it could undercut the autonomy of the fiercely independent
news executive.

   The individuals, who declined to be named, said top
management is discussing naming Eric Ober, the popular
president of the CBS-owned stations division and a former CBS
News vice president, to a position at the news division that
doesn't now exist, making him second in command behind Mr.
Burke.
   Mr. Burke and Mr. Ober didn't return telephone calls
seeking comment, and a CBS spokeswoman declined to comment.
But several people inside CBS said Mr. Burke lately has
become embroiled in sometimes bitter disputes with CBS
President Laurence A. Tisch and his top lieutenant, Jay
Kriegel, the Tisch aide who personally recruited Mr. Burke
from ABC News two years ago.
   While it isn't clear whether Mr. Burke's departure is
imminent, one person at CBS replied that the news president
was indeed "on the ropes" when he was asked late yesterday
whether Mr. Burke's tenure was in doubt.
   The confrontations between Mr. Burke and his superiors
apparently stem in part from his fierce independence as
president of the news division. Some observers said he
rejected the involvement even of his predecessor and direct
boss, CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer.
   Mr. Burke arrived at CBS News in August 1988 as an
outsider, having spent 11 years at ABC News, a unit of
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., where he was the No. 2 executive to
ABC News President Roone Arledge. The seventh CBS News
president since 1980, he has been controversial almost since
the beginning of his tenure.
   Soon after taking over the troubled division, which had
been wracked by budget cuts and headline-making internal
squabbling, Mr. Burke clamped down on contacts with the press
and virtually silenced leaks from malcontents. Early on, he
also fired two close associates of CBS anchorman Dan Rather,
David Buksbaum and Joan Richman. And he quickly made it
clear, insiders said, that his popular predecessor, Mr.
Stringer, was no longer welcome at the CBS Broadcast Center,
the former dairy barn that's the headquarters of CBS News on
West 57th Street here.
   The most public setback for Mr. Burke occurred in February
when he suspended Andy Rooney, the "60 Minutes" humorist,
after remarks appeared in a magazine attributed to Mr. Rooney
that were derogatory toward blacks and homosexuals. After
strong and relentless protests from people within CBS News,
including Don Hewitt, executive producer of "60 Minutes," and
correspondent Mike Wallace, and a slide in the program's
ratings, Mr. Burke reluctantly reinstated Mr. Rooney after
only one month of the three-month suspension.
   Despite that highly publicized incident, Mr. Burke is
credited at CBS News with rejuvenating the network's
coverage. For instance, CBS News was considered the most
aggressive in covering last year's student uprising in China.
In addition, Mr. Rather has gotten out of the studio more
frequently to report from the scene of major stories.
   However, the "CBS Evening News," which once dominated the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, has slipped into second place
behind "ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings" and is
barely ahead of "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw." ABC News
has been No. 1 for the past 33 weeks.
   Not only has the network's showcase newscast lost ratings
during Mr. Burke's tenure, but two of the three prime-time
series produced by CBS News have had setbacks as well. "48
Hours," a moderate ratings success, is going to be moved from
Thursday at 8 p.m. EDT to Saturday at 10 p.m. next month, the
prime-time period with the smallest potential audience. Also,
"Saturday Night with Connie Chung" was embroiled in
controversy because it reenacted actual news events, a
practice that was ultimately abandoned.
   That show was scheduled to be replaced by "Face to Face
with Connie Chung," which was going to use a heavy diet of
celebrity interviews and run on Mondays at 10 p.m., one of
the best spots on the otherwise lackluster CBS schedule.
However, the program was rescheduled to become a series of
specials, instead of a regular prime-time series after Ms.
Chung said she wanted a lighter work load in order to try to
have a baby. The unexpected move was a severe financial
setback for CBS News, which could have made millions of
dollars in advertising revenue from the show.
