   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- President Bush took a veiled swipe
at television newscasters who have traveled to Iraq in recent
days, all the while insisting that wasn't what he was doing.
   Responding to news media complaints about restrictions
that Saudi Arabia has placed on coverage, the president said
in his news conference here that "the more coverage the
better, as far as we're concerned. However, when people
travel to countries like Iraq and countries of that nature, I
hope the press coverage will be totally objective . . . I
hope the same tough questions are asked in every country, as
they are in this country, and I'm speaking of Iraq,
particularly."

   Some Bush loyalists have privately been angry at the first
American television correspondents to broadcast from Baghdad
after the Kuwait invasion -- ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Dan
Rather -- for what the loyalists regard as uncritical
coverage of the Iraqis. Mr. Bush may have been reflecting
some of those feelings as well.
   But when the president was asked specifically whether he
was criticizing the coverage, he insisted he wasn't. "I
learned long ago that you've got the loudest mike, and I just
am standing here, so I'm not criticizing," he said. "Don't be
so sensitive about it."
