   If you want to know how much trouble American public
education is in, ask Albert Shanker, head of the American
Federation of Teachers. Last month, he bluntly told delegates
to the union's convention it was time to "talk honestly"
about the abysmal state of public education.
   "How bad are things?" he asked his fellow teachers.
"Ninety-five percent of the kids who go to college in the
U.S. would not be admitted to college anywhere else in the
world." If any teachers doubted this, Mr. Shanker asked them
to test their own 17-year-olds by having them explain a
newspaper editorial, write something or do a two-part math
problem. "Do it for yourself so you get a good picture of
where you are," he said. "You won't be moved to change unless
you believe things are really bad."

   Mr. Shanker admitted teachers needed "to come up with some
kind of system we can put into our public schools to show
that something bad will happen if we don't do a good job, and
something good will happen if we do." But then he repeated
his opposition to the one device that would foster
competition in education -- choice. He called instead for
"restructuring" the public schools.
   It is perhaps too much to expect Mr. Shanker to endorse
vouchers or tax-credit plans that may disrupt the job
security of his members, but parents have looked at what the
30% increase in real spending on education since 1981 has
bought them and increasingly are deciding that choice, not
more money, is the answer.
   It seems there is growing support among everyone except
public-school careerists for the idea of choice. So it's now
important to start sorting out choice plans that can work
from those that paper over the problem.
   One rule of thumb in assessing the potential value of a
choice plan is, how loudly do the defenders of the status quo
-- union leaders and bureaucrats -- condemm it? On that
basis, Wisconsin state legislator Polly Williams takes the
honors. Next month her voucher plan will pay up to $2,500
each to allow hundreds of poor Milwaukee students to attend
private nonsectarian schools.
   Herbert Grover, Wisconsin's Schools Superintendent, has
waged a legal war against the Williams plan. This month, he
accused Mrs. Williams of being "used" by business interests
who want to privatize education.
   Mrs. Williams says it is rather the Milwaukee
public-school bureaucracy that has "used" her constituents'
money to build an educational empire that fails to teach
basic skills. Busloads of black parents recently went to the
state capital in Madison to show Mr. Grover who really
supports Polly Williams. A court has declared the voucher
plan constitutional, and on Monday a higher court denied a
request for an injunction against it.
   The situation is different in Detroit. There, voters
elected a new school board in 1988 that promised educational
choice. But board members have tired of hand-to-hand combat
with the resisting unions, and have shelved real choice in
favor of allowing parent-teacher committees some say over
local school policy. The Detroit News reports that even this
plan has met with such opposition from principals that only
six out of some 250 schools are involved. Black parents
grumble they may have to elect a new board to secure real
change.
   Somewhere between Milwaukee's boldness and Detroit's
passivity is New York state, which has proposed a series of
conventional reforms to make schools more accountable to
parents. But buried among them is a bold proposal "to reward
schools for success and mete out consequences for failure."
Schools that failed to meet standards would be
"de-registered" and closed. Their students would then be
allowed to use vouchers to attend other public or nonpublic
schools.
   Teacher unions fiercely oppose this idea, calling it a
backdoor effort to undermine the public schools. But State
Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol says public schools
should be forced to compete if they cannot perform at a
minimal level.
   Opponents of both the New York plan and Mrs. Williams say
choice is favored by elitists and the rich, ignoring polls
that show blacks and the poor favor it more than the middle
class, whose schools often still work. Both sides will be
keenly watching the November elections in liberal Oregon,
where an educational-choice initiative is on the ballot. It
would allow students to attend public schools outside their
area and provide tax credits for those wishing to go to
private schools. Poor people who paid no state income tax
would get a voucher of up to $2,500 a year to allow them to
participate.
   Educational choice is the key to solving the problems that
Mr. Shanker and other educators now admit exist. It would
inject real opportunity into America's depressed inner
cities. That's why the most fervent proponents of genuine
choice today are poor and minority parents who see
competition as the only way to secure a quality education for
their kids.
