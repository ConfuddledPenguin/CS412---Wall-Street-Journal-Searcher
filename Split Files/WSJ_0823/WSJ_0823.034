   NEW YORK -- The Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange said floor
broker Stephen Amato was fined $11,500 and expelled from
exchange membership for violation of trading rules.
   The exchange, inaugurating a policy of publicly announcing
expulsions and suspensions, accused Mr. Amato of violating
rules relating to order execution, "cross trading" and the
proper recording of trades.

   The fine imposed by an exchange adjudication committee is
one of the largest the coffee exchange has ever levied. The
coffee exchange is one of five New York-based commodity
futures exchanges, which along with the major Chicago
commodity markets have been under increasing government
pressure to discipline their members more severely.
   Besides his explusion as a member, Mr. Amato was
permanently barred from any employment on the coffee-exchange
floor.
   Mr. Amato couldn't be reached for comment. The coffee
exchange notified the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
that Mr. Amato didn't respond to the charges when they were
brought several months ago, nor did he request a hearing to
rebut them, a CFTC spokesman said.
