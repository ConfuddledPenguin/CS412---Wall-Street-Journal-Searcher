   DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia -- Fifty rifle-carrying Bedouins
wearing thick bandoliers of ammunition snap to attention as
Prince Muhammed bin Fahd walks into the arena-size sitting
room of his palace.
   The prince is governor of Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province,
currently overrun with some 100,000 refugees from Kuwait. A
growing chunk of the U.S. military also is encamped here
along the west coast of the Persian Gulf. The Saudis must
provide tank-carrying trucks, troop-carrying buses and much
other logistical support to help the U.S. soldiers defend the
oil fields, if need be, against an attack by Iraq.

   A few miles away, in Dhahran, engineers for the
government-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. are working out ways
to pump an extra two million barrels of oil a day, crude that
will be desperately needed to ease the shock threatening the
world's economy if the Persian Gulf crisis continues. They
are confident that if ordered to do so, they could do it
quickly.
   The Eastern Province, home of some two million Saudis,
amounts to a company town and, one way or another, the
company -- Saudi Aramco -- is going to take care of the
prince's problems.
   Who will buy gas masks, asks a group of Western reporters,
invited to watch the prince hold court? Who will house and
feed the Kuwaitis? "The government is taking care of that,"
he responds.
   According to Western experts, the government can well
afford to solve the problems, for the crisis has kicked up
the price of oil by more than $10 a barrel. If it decides to
pump the additional oil, the Saudi government will bring in
an extra $100 million a day, they say.
   The mood here is definitely bullish. "We support you with
our blood," says a Kuwaiti supplicant, one of a long line of
turbaned men waiting to hand the prince a petition seeking
help.
   The lifeblood of the Eastern Province is crude and there
is a stupefyingly large amount of it. For example, Prince
Fahd's court sits on Dammam field, an oil formation
containing more than a billion barrels. It has been closed
for several years because the Saudis no longer needed to pump
it.
   The Saudi government has assured the Bush administration
and a number of other oil-thirsty countries that it will
produce the extra oil needed to help them through the crisis,
although the formal announcement will come after further
negotiations with other oil-producing states.
   "It will take some time, but if told to do it in a hurry,
we have tremendous flexibility," explains Sidney D. Bowers,
consultant to Saudi Aramco and formerly chief geologist for
the company when it was owned by four U.S. oil companies.
   During the past two years the company has discovered six
oil fields, most of them containing more than a billion
barrels apiece. It has 53 others, including the fabled Ghawar
field, an underground lake of petroleum that is 160 miles
long and 20 miles wide. In all, there are some 257 billion
barrels of proven reserves here, 25% of the world's supply.
   Mr. Bowers points out that the U.S. has only two oil
fields containing more than a billion barrels and that most
of the U.S. oil comes from fields that are on the verge of
old age.
   "These {Saudi} fields are so good that they're in what we
call a juvenile state," he adds, noting that they provide
plenty of pressure to pump the oil. While production costs in
older fields in the U.S. and elsewhere can run well beyond
$20 a barrel, the Saudis are believed to pump oil at a
maximum cost of about $2 a barrel.
   While the economics for the extra effort are in place, the
social strain of the crisis is beginning to wear on Saudi
Aramco. So far, according to company officials, it has sent
home 3,000 dependents of its expatriate workers, many of them
Americans. Only about 1% of its 11,000 foreign workers have
left, they add.
   Mr. Bowers points out that the company has surged to meet
bigger crises before. In 1977, when a fire knocked out six
million barrels of daily production in one field, oil workers
jury-rigged pumping systems from other fields to make up the
shortfall in a month.
   In those days the company, then called Arabian-American
Oil Co., or Aramco, pumped almost twice the 5.3 million
barrels that it pumps today. Falling oil prices, starting in
1980, forced production cutbacks and sent the economy of the
Eastern Province into a 10-year recession.
   The invasion of Kuwait has ended that and has graphically
underscored the long interdependence between the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia that began one day in 1933 when Max Steineke, a
stubborn geologist for Standard Oil Co. of California, saw a
peculiar, dome-shaped hill near here and had a hunch there
was oil in it.
   Four years and four dry holes later, he had experienced
multiple cave-ins, many broken drill bits and the deep
despair of a Westerner who has spent too much time in the
desert. "No oil, no water," he said in one terse message to
California.
   His fifth well, the following year, brought in the Dammam
field.
