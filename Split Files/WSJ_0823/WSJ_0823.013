   DAYTON, Ohio -- Philips Industries Inc. said shareholders
approved the previously announced acquisition of the company
by Tomkins PLC.
   In June, London-based Tomkins, which makes lawnmowers,
bicycles, handguns and other metal products, agreed to
acquire Philips for $550 million, or $18.50 a share. Philips
makes windows, bathtubs, air-moving equipment and other
residential, commercial and industrial items. Philips said
the acquisition was to be completed yesterday. Philips
expects payment for its surrendered shares to begin Sept. 6.
