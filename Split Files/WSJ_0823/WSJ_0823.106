   CMS Energy Corp. said it agreed to jointly build a $105
million transmission line connecting its Consumers Power Co.
subsidiary with a utility subsidiary of PSI Resources Inc.
   CMS said it plans to use the transmission line to sell
electric power from its 49%-owned Midland Cogeneration
Venture, a 1,370 megawatt, gas-fired plant. CMS of Jackson,
Mich., said it will spend about $55 million for the project.
Plainfield, Ind.-based PSI Resources will contribute about
$50 million.

   The companies will link their systems with a 345-kilovolt
transmission line between Battle Creek, Mich., and Akron,
Ind.
   The transmission facilities are expected to be in
operation by December 1992. The project is contingent upon
regulatory approval.
   The Midland Cogeneration Venture was designed as a nuclear
power plant but abandoned before completion in 1984. The
plant reopened on March 16 as a gas-fired plant. CMS said its
Consumers Power subsidiary purchases more than 800 megawatts
from Midland Cogeneration Venture.
