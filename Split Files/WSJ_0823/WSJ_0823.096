   The heat of the Persian Gulf crisis is about to singe the
American workplace.
   Though matters of parting and danger may be uppermost in
Americans' minds, questions about the jobs they leave behind
are also coming up in the wake of President Bush's plans for
a reservist call-up. Initially, a call-up of 40,000 military
reservists is likely, though Mr. Bush could call as many as
200,000 of the nation's 1.7 million reservists for the Gulf
crisis without consulting Capitol Hill.

   The call-up could have serious effects for such companies
as AMR Corp.'s American Airlines. About 1,200 American
pilots, or 15% of the carrier's total, are reserve members.
   Army Reserve officials say they're being flooded this week
with calls from reservists and their employers, who are
anxious to know their responsibilities to each other.
Reservists traditionally leave their jobs for an initial four
to six months of training, followed by one weekend of duty
each month and two weeks of "summer camp" annually. But no
one is sure how long the Persian Gulf call-up may last.
   Here is how a number of Army Reserve and National Guard
legal authorities answer questions about the call-up:
                                                                                                       

   Q: As an employer, do I have to pay my reservist while he
or she is on active military duty?
   A: No, the military pays according to rank. But some
employers make up the difference between the usually-lower
military pay and the civilian salary when a reservist goes
off to summer camp.
                                                                                                       

   Q: As an employer, do I have to give the returning
reservist his same job?
   A: No. But federal law requires you to offer him a job
with the same pay, rank and seniority that he could have
expected if his work hadn't been interrupted by emergency
military duty.
                                                                                                       

   Q: But if an employee was promoted right before the
call-up, or promised a raise, does he still get the new job
and additional money when he returns?
   A: He should receive a job in line with the promised
promotion and raise.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Does that apply if the reservist volunteered for
emergency duty, instead of being ordered to report?
   A: Yes. Volunteers' jobs are protected in the same manner
as those called up.
                                                                                                       

   Q: How long do I have to hold open a job for reservists?
   A: At least four years, and that can be extended by
federal request if the emergency lasts.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Do I still have insurance responsibility for my
reservists?
   A: No, government insurance kicks in when soldiers go on
active duty. Medical insurance for their dependents is also
covered by Uncle Sam. Dependents' dental insurance isn't
covered by the government, but continuing any such civilian
program is the employer's decision.
                                                                                                       

   Q: If a reservist returns so badly disabled that he can't
hold down his previous job, do I still have to hire him?
   A: Yes, and offer him a job he can perform that's as close
in pay, rank and seniority to the one he left.
                                                                                                       

   Q: If a reservist is called up merely to serve in the
motor pool across town, and doesn't go to the Middle East, do
I still have to offer him a job later?
   A: Yes.
                                                                                                       

   Q: If the crisis that spawned the call-up ends, and the
reservist takes a liking to active duty, do I still have to
keep a job open?
   A: Yes, for as much as four years after emergency duty
called.
                                                                                                       

   Q: How much notice do my reservists have to give me that
they're leaving?
   A: None. For strategic and security reasons, if they
receive military orders, they may be required to leave
without telling you.
                                                                                                       

   Q: When my reservists are released from duty after the
crisis, can I require them to get right back to work?
   A: No. They may take as much as 90 days of unpaid leave
time, as they wish.
                                                                                                       

   Q: May I -- for budgetary reasons -- wait 90 days before
putting them back on the payroll?
   A: No. If they want to return the day they're off military
duty, you're required to take them.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What if a reservist gets into some kind of legal
trouble in the military -- the kind of thing that might have
influenced me against hiring him in the first place?
   A: If the reservist has an honorable-discharge paper, he's
qualified to come back. Otherwise, the employer might be able
to refuse him.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What if I sell my company to someone else while the
reservists are gone?
   A: The new owner inherits the company's previous
obligations to reservists.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What if my business goes into bankruptcy court while
the reservist is gone, or I go into another business he
doesn't know much about?
   A: You're still obligated to hire him if you have payroll.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What if I disagree with any of this and refuse to
comply?
   A: Reservists' complaints against civilian employers will
be investigated by the local U.S. attorney.
                                                                                                       

   Q: As a reservist being called up, and taking a big pay
reduction, do I have to keep making my current credit-card
payments?
   A: Yes, but interest rates on credit cards, car payments
and certain other loans to reservists may be reduced to 6%
under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940.
Some companies -- American Express Co., for example -- say
debt extensions may be negotiable in some cases. However,
military law holds armed forces personnel responsible for
their debts, and wages can be garnisheed to pay them.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What about mortgage payments and child support?
   A: The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940
allows called-up reservists to apply to their lenders for
reductions of interest rates to a cap of 6%. Foreclosures and
repossessions involving debt incurred before the call-up will
require a court order. As for child support, an Army legal
spokeswoman says, reservists are still responsible, and any
reductions would have to be negotiated on a case-by-case
basis.
