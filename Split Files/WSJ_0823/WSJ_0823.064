   DALLAS BUSINESSMAN ROBERT L. BECK is a man of conviction.
After his 23-year-old son was killed by a drunken driver in
1982, he took five years out of his life to work full time as
the unpaid chairman and chief executive of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving, founded in 1980 by a California woman who had
lost a child to the same deadly mixture of automobiles and
alcohol.
   Local MADD members had rallied to the Becks' support after
their tragedy and he wanted to do something in return. A New
Jersey native, he had come to Dallas as a group vice
president of National Gypsum, where he had started as general
counsel. After the company's 1976 move to Texas, in 1986 the
company was sold to a management group, with financial help
from a French building-materials company, for $1.7 billion.
Mr. Beck, already a MADD director, then volunteered to become
the nonprofit organization's unpaid, full-time chief
executive. Money from the buy-out, he and his wife decided,
would let them live without his Gypsum salary.
   When he took on the new job, the 56-year-old executive
recalls, he was told he would "never make a difference." He
did. In 1984, MADD had 300,000 members. Last year it had 1.8
million in almost 400 chapters in the U.S. and overseas and
the group's income in contributions totaled $42.5 million.
The fight against drunk drivers, Mr. Beck points out, isn't
limited to those who have suffered. Only 40% of his members
are from families that have been directly involved in
drunk-driving tragedies; the other 60% are what Mr. Beck
calls "interested citizens."
   All he did, Mr. Beck says, was graft corporate principles
onto a nonprofit organization. The rules came right out of
any MBA notebook -- rigid cost controls, budgets, strategic
planning, marketing.
   What MADD markets, Mr. Beck says, is public awareness and
education. Some of its devices are standard. A national
poster and essay contest last year drew 45,000 entries;
another campaign had volunteers distribute 30 million red
ribbons to be tied to automobiles as a signal that their
drivers were not drinking and driving.
   More significant are MADD's legislative scores,
particularly when the organization, as Mr. Beck notes, does
no actual lobbying. As a nonprofit educational group, it is
forbidden by law to lobby but that prohibition doesn't apply
to members acting as individual citizens. Those members, for
example, were prime movers in promoting the 1984 federal law
that encouraged states to raise the legal drinking age to 21.
MADD also pushed a 1988 act to offer highway-fund incentives
to promote state anti-drunk-driving laws and to require
warnings against drunk driving on alcoholic beverage
containers.
   Television has been one of Mr. Beck's major marketing
channels. Working with Harvard Medical School, he got MADD
involved in helping TV scriptwriters to work direct messages
into their shows promoting designated (i.e. non-drinking)
drivers for partygoers. Broadcasters had argued that
advertisers would shun any thing that smacked of a message
but when sponsors were told, Mr. Beck says, "they wanted in."
Two top-rated shows that included the designated-driver idea
in scripts are "Cheers" and "L.A. Law."
   Mr. Beck has involved MADD in a more prickly problem --
persuading beer and wine advertisers not to use shows with
heavy percentages of viewers under 21. Beer is the top drink
for teen-agers and most of it is consumed in automobiles,
according to studies by the National Parents Resource
Institute. MADD wants TV producers to find other sponsors for
youth-directed shows.
   Mr. Beck is now stepping out of his full-time MADD job. He
has the controls he wanted. The 50 people in the Dallas
headquarters include full-time paid managers -- an executive
director, a financial officer and a professional fund-raiser.
So he is returning to his first career, the law, as executive
director of Hughes &amp; Luce. "I can still practice law," he
says, "but I spend 99% of my time managing." A new chairman,
a Baton Rouge physician (who lost a brother-in-law in a
drunk-driving crash) will be taking over. Mr. Beck will stay
for a while as a director. And he can certainly leave with
the conviction that he did make a difference.
