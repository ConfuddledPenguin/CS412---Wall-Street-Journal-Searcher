   CHECKS AND BALANCES: Accounting firms cut back services
and clients.
   More lawsuits and the S&amp;L crisis cause firms to take steps
against exposure. The American Institute of CPAs tightens its
membership rules: peer review for those auditing public
companies is mandatory this year. "Firms are much more
careful who they have as clients," says Walter Primoff, of
the New York State Society of CPAs. Laventhol &amp; Horwath
searches national databases to check prospective clients for
lawsuit activity. The use of engagement letters, spelling out
the services offered, rises.

   A national survey by consultant Johnson &amp; Higgins finds
eight of 10 midsize accounting firms restrict services and
56% won't take clients considered "high-risk." Chicago's
Blackman Kallick Bartelstein won't accept banks or S&amp;Ls;
smaller firms move out of public-company auditing, says
attorney Dan Goldwasser. The cost of more thorough review
creates fee pressures, says Ned Futter of Wiss &amp; Co., and
firms offer quality-control incentives to employees, says Jay
Nisberg, a Ridgefield, Conn., consultant.
   The risk of getting turned away is higher for start-up
concerns "who really need" the services, says Mr. Primoff.
                                                                                                       

   THE MUSICAL RUSSIANS are coming. But is it more than we
can bear?
   Glasnost raises the number of Soviet performing artists
appearing in the U.S. The Institute for Soviet-American
Relations says 313 U.S. groups organize such events, nearly
triple the number in 1983. Cultural exchanges, which used to
show that "the other side didn't have horns and tails," now
are a full-blown exhibition of cultural pride, says the
institute's Eliza Klose.
   But sponsorship is one-sided. U.S. firms still carry much
of the cost. The result: A flood of Soviet artists and
musicians coming here. "They're sending everybody and
anybody," says William Lockwood, of Lincoln Center, of the
rise in Soviet requests to showcase performers. Promoters
worry that saturation could hurt ticket sales. But some don't
mind the influx. "The audience will get more discriminating,"
says the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Ara Guzelimian.
                                                                                                       

   BOWING TO THE JAPANESE finds favor among U.S. firms
   "The Japanese are terrific shoppers," says an R.H. Macy &amp;
Co. spokeswoman. Among the department store's recent efforts
to attract Japanese customers by using their language:
shopping invitations placed in New York hotels; store signs;
a consultant with tips on shopping, entertainment and food,
and fashion shows. The San Francisco Macy's works with
convention planners to arrange shopping sprees. American
Express has a 24-hour hotline with Japanese-speaking
operators and travel counselors in several cities.
   Hotels join the effort. A special room-service menu at the
Hyatt Regency in Dearborn, Mich., offers sushi and miso soup,
and Japanese cooking classes. Some staffers at the Belleview
Biltmore Resort Hotel in Clearwater, Fla., study the language
and gear up for All Nippon Airways' plan to fly direct to
nearby Orlando. The Japan Travel Bureau launches a restaurant
coupon program with a fixed menu at each of 20 New York
eateries, including Tavern on the Green, to avoid confusion
in ordering.
   Despite the efforts, U.S. firms need to do more promotion
in Japan, says Kazuo Hirai of the Japan Travel Bureau.
                                                                                                       

   AIRING THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY is what New Jersey employees of
International Business Machines Corp. and American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. are doing. Dry cleaner Cristopher Evans sets
up shop at these and other suburban corporate sites, and
plans to expand.
                                                                                                       

   AT LEAST he was insured. A premium-payment letter Gen.
Custer mailed to Equitable Life Assurance weeks before he
died at the Battle of the Little Bighorn is offered for
$35,000 by manuscript dealer Joe Rubinfine. Custer's parents
collected $5,000.
                                                                                                       

   WALK ON: The U.S. Mallwalk Association offers product
coupons, samples to the fitness-conscious over-50 set with
money and calories to burn. Malls look for mileage from
mallwalkers who join the group.
                                                                                                       

   LIEN FILINGS BUILD as property slump starts to affect
smaller firms.
   Subcontractors and suppliers respond to more late payments
by general contractors and developers by filing more liens on
homes and commercial properties. Richard Wakefield, a Lutz,
Fla., lien server, says recent state activity is up 25%. The
American Subcontractors Association recommends filing as soon
as payments are missed; a subcontractor simply "can't rip up
the concrete he just poured," says the group's Colette
Nelson. Liens don't ensure payment, but prevent a property's
sale.
   Lien laws differ widely by state. Some property owners
face liens by subcontractors who haven't been paid by general
contractors, even though the owner paid the general
contractor in full. Florida senior citizens complain of more
such liens. Among protections: joint or direct payment of
general and subcontractors, or lien waivers, such as those
Donald Trump got from subcontractors on the Taj Mahal Casino.
   Michigan has a pool funded by construction contractors to
pay subcontractors if a general contractor defaults.
