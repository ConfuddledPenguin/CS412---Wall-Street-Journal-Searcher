   Merida, Spain -- The storks didn't nest this year in their
thicket of twigs on the bell tower of the chapel of the
Brothers of Jesus. It was just as well. The chapel, together
with the rest of the old monastery that has become the
luxurious parador of Merida, seemed to be in a state of
continuous uproar.
   They said it was the opening of the bull ring that kept
the bar and dining room turgid with laughter and cigar smoke
until far into the night. And the once trickling tourist
trade now is in full spate here in the heart of Extremadura,
once -- and officially still -- the remotest province of
Spain.

   Merida became a piece of the Roman Empire's Spanish legacy
when Hadrian, himself a Spaniard, bestowed land grants on the
veterans of his legions. It has a big Roman bridge and a
theater and arena, all in usable condition.
   After the Romans left and the Moors were driven out,
Extremadura retired to the state of a poor and backward
province of thin harvests and granite badlands. Its young men
shook the dust from their feet to seek their fortunes far
afield, and those young men included, in the 16th century,
Cortez and Pizarro the great conquistadors, and hundreds of
their best and toughest followers.
   The treasure they won enriched the monasteries and
aggrandized the little towns they left behind. So that today,
above the plains of warm winter pasture patterned with cork
oak rise their churches and citadels, like old, dark mirrors
that once reflected the gold of Mexico and Peru.
   Caceres, Trujillo, Plasencia, Medellin, Guadalupe -- that
Guadalupe of the black Virgin who became the patroness of the
New World -- their pale stones are the half-forgotten
remnants of a lonely, almost ghostly society harder than that
in any other part of Spain. It certainly seems far more
primitive and primeval than the sophisticated, graceful land
of Moorish Andalusia just to the south, which preceded it in
history by many centuries.
   The roads of Extremadura are still fairly empty, but the
irrigation of the Guadiana river basin around Merida is a
sign that this region is being touched by the sudden
prosperity of the rest of Spain.
   Because it has been remote for so long, Extremadura is one
of the last refuges of many forms of wildlife, such as the
Spanish wolf and the imperial eagle. It goes without saying
that, being a refuge, it is threatened from the outside, by
agricultural and commercial pressures.
   Development devours. But tourism devours too, and long
before these cities and their landscapes over-proliferate or
are plowed under, they may damage themselves irremediably by
becoming self-conscious and self-exploiting for the benefit
of the world's curiosity seekers.
   And so this parador, which years ago had reflected its
origins by imparting to the traveler a patio-shadowed
tranquillity, now bustles with clamorous middle-class chic.
You must go down to the town square, chilled by the heavy
rain but fragrant with orange blossoms, to Merida's other
hotel, the Emperatriz, if you want the un-self-conscious.
   There you can see long tables set in rows in the great
central courtyard, tiled in blue lined with pots of
aspidistra. Eighty guests at least are expected to celebrate
the baptism of three infant cousins just performed in the
adjoining well-worn church of Santa Maria Mayor.
   The fine-feathered relations flutter through the courtyard
and begin to tussle over the favored seats, stopping
frequently to exchange greetings and to sip drinks. It will
be a while yet before the meal begins.
   Some children in their Sunday clothes crawl over a
somnolent old man leaning on his gold-headed stick, his
pearl-gray homburg on the table beside him. Across the room,
two matrons stylish in black lace chew the cherries in their
mahogany-colored cocktails. Here is the re-enactment of an
old rite, authentic, deliberate and recognizable, even to a
tourist.
   No one at the hotel desk admits to knowing why the hotel
is called Emperatriz, or Empress. We conclude that it must be
after the Empress Eugenie, glamorous wife of Napoleon III,
who came from Montijo, a small town 25 miles due west of
Merida, on the way to the Portuguese frontier.
