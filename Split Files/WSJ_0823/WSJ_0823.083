   Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. said it completed its acquisition
of General Instrument Corp., a cable-TV equipment company,
for $1.5 billion.
   Some 95.5% of General Instrument, or 29.9 million common
shares, was tendered under the New York buy-out firm's
$44.50-a-share offer, which expired Tuesday at 5 p.m., a
Forstmann spokeswoman said. The remaining shares will be
redeemed at the same price.

   Including options that were converted as part of the
purchase, General Instrument had about 34.6 million shares
outstanding, she added.
   In connection with the deal, General Instrument said it
will redeem all its remaining subordinated convertible
debentures on Sept. 12 for a total price of $1,068.27,
including interest, for each $1,000 face amount.
Alternatively, before the redemption, holders may convert the
debentures, which pay 7.25% and are due in 2012, into
$1,097.01 in cash for each $1,000 outstanding.
   The Forstmann spokeswoman said virtually all debentures
had been converted prior to the buy-out, and she expected any
remaining holders to take the cash offer.
   In its fiscal year ended Feb. 28, General Instrument
earned $98.7 million, or $3.27 a share, on revenue of $1.38
billion.
