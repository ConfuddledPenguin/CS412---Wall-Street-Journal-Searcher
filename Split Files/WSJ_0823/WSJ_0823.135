   As the Gulf crisis enters its second week, it's far from
clear whether Saddam Hussein will wind up winner or loser.
What is clearer is that there will be other regional losers
-- beyond the exiled emir of Kuwait.
   The likeliest loser of all is Jordan's King Hussein, the
region's longest reigning ruler. Like a cat with nine lives,
the cautious, clever, sometimes opportunistic and always
gracious monarch, has somehow managed for nearly four decades
to slip sundry snares: assassination attempts, PLO-inspired
civil rebellion, anti-royalist coups across the Mideast,
chaos and carnage in neighboring Lebanon, and, of course,
Arab-Israeli conflicts. But this time the cat seems likely to
be belled.

   It's among the sadder ironies of the current situation
that the basically moderate and pro-Western Jordanian monarch
who prides himself on close relations with all but one (Jimmy
Carter) of the last eight U.S. presidents has wound up as the
puppet of Iraq's amoral, anti-Western and anti-royalist
Saddam Hussein. Jordan's king, no fool, has been played for
one by a wily neighbor with whom he shares neither values nor
interests.
   How this came about is a tangled tale. Nearly a decade ago
King Hussein edged into alliance with Iraq in its war with
Iran both to support a fraternal Arab state and to contain
the Islamic fundamentalism that Iran's Shiite ayatollahs were
unleashing. As that war largely shut down Persian Gulf
shipping, it was Jordan's port of Aqaba that became Iraq's
military and commercial lifeline. King Hussein also gave
Saddam another gift -- respectability. The degree to which
Western and Arab powers came to view Iraq as the lesser evil
to Iran was in no small part due to the king's patronage of
his uncivilized neighbor. The scene was much like a little
organ grinder leading around a giant gorilla on a leash. The
rest of the Arab world, especially the Saudis and Kuwaitis,
poured billions into the gorilla's tin cup.
   In recent months, as King Hussein worried more than usual
about what he saw as the twin threats of Soviet Jewish
immigration into the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Palestinian radicalism within his own borders, the organ
grinder became more and more the instrument of the gorilla.
Saddam Hussein played on the king's fears of Israeli
expansionism and promised him protection. Furthermore, King
Hussein, who prides himself on loyalty, felt a genuine
friendship for Saddam Hussein.
   Jordan has benefited from the friendship with Iraq.
Baghdad supplies oil, jobs for Jordanians and the major
market for Jordanian products. Commerce through the port of
Aqaba is vital to Jordan's sick economy, certain to get
sicker with the loss of remittances from Jordanians working
in Iraq and Kuwait. As the West imposes an economic blockade
of Iraq, Jordan will be the first to feel its pain. If the
king seeks to keep Aqaba open, he'll incur more Western
wrath. If he closes Aqaba to Iraqi supplies, he will fuel
radicalism in Jordan and hasten his demise.
   In an interview six weeks ago, the king was visibly
traumatized by what he saw as the likelihood of an
Israeli-instigated Mideast war. Israel, he said, sought a
pretext to topple his kingdom and turn it into a homeland for
Palestinians pushed from Israel to make room for Soviet Jews.
He said the risks of war were greater than at any time in his
37-year rule.
   The king's rule began when he was a teen-ager and his
grandfather, King Abdullah was stabbed in front of him during
Friday prayers in Jersualem. King Abdullah had been installed
in Transjordan by the British, who created the country in
1921 as a consolation prize for him after they removed him
from the Hejaz, now part of Saudi Arabia, in favor of Ibn
Saud, founder of the Saudi royal family. The British took the
young King Hussein to England to train him in soldiering and
continued to advise him back in Jordan.
   The interview took place in the king's sitting room, as
ever decorated with photographs of European royal friends.
This time he had a new photo -- that of Saddam Hussein. As
the king spoke, there was Saddam staring over his shoulder,
almost visibly abetting his nightmares.
   A few days later, in an interview in Baghdad, Saddam
Hussein exuded confidence. He wasn't focused on visions of an
Israeli attack but rather on posturing as leader of the Arab
world. There were no photos of friends in his marble audience
chamber. Indeed, less than 24 hours before the invasion,
Saddam Hussein lied so persuasively to King Hussein about his
plans that the Jordanian monarch phoned his friend George
Bush to assure him, against satellite and other evidence,
that the Iraqis hadn't any intention of invading Kuwait.
   The two Husseins couldn't be more different in personal
style. King Hussein is gracious, charming, and ever attentive
to others. At an outdoor birthday party for one of his young
sons a few years back, he disappeared into his palace and
returned with sweaters and shawls for all the mothers who had
begun to shiver in the evening coolness. Meetings are usually
in his small family sitting room. And at any meeting he never
fails to ask first in his flawless English about one's health
and offer juice and tea before getting down to business. If a
visitor needs a ride, the king will sometimes take the wheel
of his Mercedes and personally chauffeur. He frequently takes
his young sons by his American wife with him and smiles
patiently when they snuff out his cigarettes, chiding him
about his bad habit.
   By contrast, Saddam Hussein makes no attempt to be
charming. To greet visitors, he stands erect and stiffly
offers his hand. Pleasantries are nonexistent. While he has
begun to wear expensive Western suits, he remains as insular
as the king is sophisticated and well-traveled. The Iraqi
leader's only trip to the West was more than a decade ago.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has forced Arab leaders to
choose sides. Over the weekend, as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak,
Syria's Hafez al Assad, and other lesser leaders finally
lined up with Saudi Arabia, there was King Hussein, holding
the bag for Saddam Hussein. Not only has the king missed an
opportunity to protect Saudi Arabia, earning gratitude and
desperately needed largesse, he also has ended up opposing
the interests of the U.S., whose support and protection he
spent decades cultivating. The king is now in no man's land,
used and abused by Saddam and isolated from his natural
allies. The king can no longer count on support from a U.S.
president he personally mislead and since has failed to
support. Nor can he count on Israel, in whose eyes, Jordan
may have outlived its usefulness.
   The biggest danger to King Hussein, however, is his
"friend" Saddam Hussein, who aims to arouse masses throughout
the Mideast to a jihad, or holy war, against American
imperialists and Zionists. His response to Mideast leaders
who oppose him will be to forment riot and rebellion against
those leaders.
   Saddam's offer this weekend to withdraw from Kuwait if
Israel vacates territories taken from Jordan, Syria and Egypt
and if Syria withdraws from Lebanon, has greatly enhanced his
appeal across the Arab world. This is only the beginning of
the propaganda battle. Kerbela and Najaf, two of Shia Islam's
holiest sites are in southern Iraq, where Saddam could easily
bomb them and blame it on Israel or America. Such an act
would almost certainly guarantee a Mideast firestorm against
every Westerner in the region.
   King Hussein is uniquely vulnerable. He is a Hashemite
ruler of a state where 60% of the population is Palestinian.
Moreover, his pro-Western history makes him suspect to
Islamic fundamentalists, who already are flooding Jordanian
mosques to chant "Down With America."
   The confrontation between America and Saddam Hussein will
certainly get much nastier. As it does, the risks to the king
will rise accordingly. Even if Saddam does not seek to
dethrone the king, rising radicalism at home seems likely to
accomplish that. At the same time, rising radicalism in
Jordan will be seen as a threat by the Israelis, who then may
opt for toppling the king and taking Jordan before he
crumbles of his own accord.
   The whirlwind Saddam Hussein is sowing could well claim
other victims. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, America's
staunchest ally in the region, faces his own fundamentalists
and skeptics about his peace with Israel. He has now added
the burden of helping to defend Saudi Arabia's unpopular
monarchy with Western "imperialists." The Saudis and
Americans, not to mention the Israelis, will be heavy burdens
for Mr. Mubarak as Saddam Hussein unleashes the high winds of
nationalism and fundamentalism. For its part, the Saudi royal
family can count on no true friend anywhere in the region and
on little popularity among its own populace.
   About the only thing that can be predicted with some
confidence is that another period of Mideast instability has
begun. The grim possiblities are almost endless, particularly
when one tosses Israeli fears and Iranian fanaticism into the
cauldron of potential chaos. If Saddam goes down, he'll take
as many others with him as possible. It is a safe bet that
neither Mideast borders nor leaders will look the same a year
from now and that the chaos will claim other victims before
it claims Saddam Hussein.
