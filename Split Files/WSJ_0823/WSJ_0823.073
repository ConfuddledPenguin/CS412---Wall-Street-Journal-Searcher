   Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., a New York-based operator
of shipping fleets, said it bought one million of its common
shares outstanding, or an indicated 2.9% of the total. Terms
and sellers weren't disclosed and the company said it
couldn't comment on whether the privately negotiated purchase
was made in a single block or several smaller transactions.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Overseas shares closed at $15.875, down 37.5 cents.

   The company had 34.9 million shares outstanding before it
said on Monday that it would buy back the one million shares
in the open market. It completed the private purchase
Tuesday. Though Overseas was intent on purchasing the shares
in the open market, "other opportunities came up," which
necessitated the privately negotiated approach, a spokesman
said.
