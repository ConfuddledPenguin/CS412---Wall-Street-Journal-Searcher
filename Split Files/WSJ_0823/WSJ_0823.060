   Score one for Goliath.
   Last fall, it looked as though David had triumphed, when a
tiny Kansas company that places local ads on video rentals
won a legal battle with Paramount Pictures. Thanks to Video
Broadcasting Systems, Wichita, some Kansans who rented "She's
Having a Baby" saw ads for Bosley's Tire Service, while those
checking out "Flashdance" got a commercial for Ridgerunners
bar.

   Paramount, which released both the videos, filed a suit
charging trademark infringement and falsely passing off
"shoddy" local ads as Paramount-approved, among other
transgressions. But in November, Paramount's wrist was
slapped by a Kansas federal court judge who denied its
request for a preliminary ban that would keep Video
Broadcasting from placing ads on Paramount releases. "This
court is frankly skeptical that viewers actually care whether
Paramount is the source or sponsor of the advertisement,"
chided the judge.
   For a while, it certainly looked as though Goliath had
been conquered. Not only Video Broadcasting, but other
similar start-up companies envisioned local pizza joints
everywhere running ads on "Batman" videos, or local discount
tire outlets strutting their stuff on videos of "Pretty
Woman." They crowed that the court victory opened the way to
massive expansion, even to franchising.
   But not so fast. While the court ruling still stands,
Video Broadcasting's business not only hasn't grown -- it has
all but gone bust. "Paramount carries a big stick," says
William Fry, the Wichita attorney representing Video
Broadcasting.
   He contends that local advertisers and retailers have been
scared off by the threat of a long, expensive legal battle
with deep-pocketed Paramount, which hasn't been shy about
throwing its considerable weight around. And, he says,
they're afraid that if they advertise on any other studio's
movies, more lawsuits will follow.
   "Store owners and advertisers don't make enough money to
stand up for their rights. Paramount has unlimited millions,"
Mr. Fry says. "Put yourself in the position of an advertiser
or store owner. They're afraid."
   Last week, after its own settlement talks with Paramount
fell through, Video Broadcasting bit back: It filed a
counterclaim against the studio alleging it is trying to put
Video Broadcasting out of business -- and asking for $105
million in damages.
   The suit charges Paramount with "malicious, intentional
interference" with Video Broadcasting's contracts with
advertisers. It alleges that Paramount made "threats" to
advertisers and retailers, saying, "We are going to keep you
in the suit and take it clear to the U.S. Supreme Court
unless you . . . agree to never allow advertisements to be
placed on Paramount-produced movies." And, it contends that
Paramount violated antitrust laws.
   A Paramount spokeswoman declined comment. And it isn't
clear whether Video Broadcasting will get anywhere with its
counterclaim, which comes a full year after Paramount first
filed its suit. But one thing is certain: Paramount's
sabre-rattling has all but killed the fledgling industry of
running local ads on national video releases.
   Video Broadcasting isn't the only company to find that
out. A similar start-up, Video Air Time of Midland, Texas,
was full of grand plans a year ago, before the Paramount suit
was filed. At the time, Video Air had placed ads for the
Raindance Car Wash on "Three Men and a Baby." Other big
releases sported ads from the Home Plate Diner, Mark Bevers
Chevrolet and the Midland Angels, a local baseball team. The
company set its sights nationwide, and was all set to sell
franchises at $25,000 a pop.
   Yet today, Video Air doesn't have any advertisers signed
up at all, and has abandoned for now its dreams of
franchising its concept. Advertisers and video stores simply
aren't interested as long as the legal threat remains on the
horizon, says Allen Frasier, president. "Until Paramount
stops screaming and yelling and threatening everybody," he
says, "its going to be a slow development.
   In Kansas, meanwhile, the ongoing lawsuit has forced Video
Broadcasting to close up shop altogether, at least for now,
its lawyer Mr. Fry says. "The company is basically doing no
business right now," he says. Its president "tried and tried
and tried. He went to some other towns, even, but two or
three good-sized orders canceled because of the lawsuit." He
adds, "We tried to avoid the war, but we couldn't."

   BBDO Wins Banks
                                                                                                       

   First Wachovia Corp., following a review that began last
December, named BBDO's Atlanta office to handle its $10
million to $12 million ad account.
   First Wachovia was served for the past 24 years by Long,
Haymes &amp; Carr, an agency based in Winston-Salem, N.C. In May,
the bank holding company selected Long Haymes, BBDO and
Hutcheson Shutze, an Atlanta shop, as finalists. Last month,
BBDO announced a plan to buy Hutcheson Schutze.
   Robert C. Copeland, First Wachovia's marketing director,
would only say that the decision "was based on an evaluation
of the finalists' presentations." First Wachovia has
headquarters in Winston-Salem and Atlanta.
   BBDO will now be responsible for creating ads for the
company's First Atlanta and Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust banks.

   TV AD REVENUES: Television Bureau of Advertising said
broadcast ad revenues in the first half rose 8% to $11
billion from $10.2 billion in the first six months of 1989.
The jump was attributed to healthy gains in the national
syndication and network categories. Spot television revenues
were also up. Revenues in the local category were relatively
flat, due to spending cuts in the automotive, retail and bank
segments, the bureau said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: Chemical Manufacturers Association, a
Washington-based trade association representing industrial
chemical production makers, awarded its ad account to
Chiat/Day/Mojo, New York. Billings haven't been set.
