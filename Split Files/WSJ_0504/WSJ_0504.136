   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., whose
name has been tarred in recent months, is thinking about
getting a new one to forge a new identity.
   Officials of the big securities firm, a unit of American
Express Co., have had what one calls "very preliminary"
discussions about changing the company's name, or at least
shortening it. One of many possibilities is going back to
"Shearson/American Express," Shearson's name for a brief time
after its takeover by American Express in 1981.

   The discussions about a name change began last summer
before the recent spate of negative publicity about Shearson;
but the bad press is now one of the factors behind a possible
change, people familiar with the discussions said.
   One change that Shearson is seriously considering is a new
name that more strongly links it with parent American Express
-- a link that Shearson has already been trying to emphasize
in a new advertising campaign as it tries to polish its
image.
   In recent months, Shearson has been battered by a series
of problems. Its chairman and president both resigned earlier
this year; American Express installed new management and
injected more than $1 billion in new capital, acting to boost
its 61% stake in Shearson to 100%.
   A Shearson spokesman declined to comment on the
name-change talks, which were first reported in Investor's
Daily.
