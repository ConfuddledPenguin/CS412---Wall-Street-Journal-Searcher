   NEW YORK -- A broker who formerly worked at Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. settled a
complaint alleging that he misappropriated $503,000 from
customers.
   Marc Stuart Weiner signed a consent decree in federal
court in Manhattan, admitting that he had defrauded some
customers, as alleged in a Securities and Exchange Commission
complaint filed in September. Mr. Weiner also consented to an
order directing him to repay $387,000, the amount of money
that he has yet to return. However, Mr. Weiner said in an
affidavit that he is currently financially unable to pay that
amount.

   Joel Rudin, Mr. Weiner's attorney, said the acts occurred
during 1986 and 1987 because Mr. Weiner was a "compulsive
gambler and had hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to
various bookies." Mr. Rudin said that for more than a year,
Mr. Weiner has attended sessions of Gambler's Anonymous.
   The SEC said Mr. Weiner is awaiting sentencing in a
criminal case in federal court in Brooklyn. In December, he
pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud arising from
some of the acts alleged in the SEC complaint.
