   The voice of conscience was soft but firm. "Even the
world's darling does not have the monopolistic right to
decide the fate of other nations," said the Lithuanian prime
minister, reading from her handwritten notes. The congressmen
grinned at that crack about Mikhail Gorbachev.
   There she went again, Kazimiera Prunskiene, making herself
a most inconvenient person. Here she is, with that wide
smile, saying things few really want to hear. A city
convinced of Mr. Gorbachev's unerring judgment is getting a
second opinion. An administration hoping for a cosy summit
May 30 suddenly must confront 40 years of Republican "Captive
Nations" rhetoric. Wouldn't you know, this 47-year-old former
economist shows up as the needy but unwanted relative, a
twinge of conscience amid cold-blooded calculations of
national interest.

   A back-seat conversation driving through town reveals
something more: She feels she's a cold-blooded realist too.
"I want to emphasize the mistake Western countries make when
they talk about the threat to Gorbachev," she says, her voice
tensing as if this is her main point. "They don't recognize
that the pressure being imposed on Gorbachev is coming from
two different directions."
   The forces of old reaction are contending with newer
"democratic forces" that want radical reform and are growing
in strength. Mr. Gorbachev has walked a delicate line between
them, she says, but sooner or later he must choose. By
squeezing Lithuania, Mr. Gorbachev sides with the
reactionaries. But the democrats all across the Soviet
"empire" support Lithuanian self-determination. "The
democratic forces understand that the question of whether we
have a democratic Soviet Union, a democratic Russia, is being
decided today in Lithuania," she says.
   What about George Bush's fear of a military coup? Pressure
from the West regarding Lithuania actually helps, rather than
hinders, Mr. Gorbachev's reform efforts, the prime minister
explains. If he sides with the democrats, he will become
stronger and have more allies to fight off the reaction.
Besides, she adds, he's firmly in control of both the
military and KGB.
   Lithuanians are willing to compromise, but only Western
pressure will ensure that Mr. Gorbachev also bargains in good
faith. She isn't asking for much nor talking about "Munich."'
What she wants are "international guarantees" to mediate the
dispute and perhaps some help to "neutralize" the Soviet
embargo.
   Her principal target, George Bush, at least avoided Gerald
Ford's Solzenitsyn mistake. President Ford's refusal to
entertain the storied Russian dissident became a metaphor for
the obsequious detente of the 1970s.
   Not that Mr. Bush or his aides had sought Mrs.
Prunskiene's company. They'd hoped she'd have the good taste
to wait until after the Bush-Gorbachev summit (and weeklong
photo-op). Lithuanian sources say her first response from the
State Department in Moscow was to wait until June. Only after
that story leaked did State find a visa, they say.
   And only after criticism from senators did the White House
join the publicity queue. Joseph Kazickas, a
Lithuanian-American who arranged her visit here, got his
first White House call Monday afternoon. Hand-wringing
National Security Council staffers had known she was coming
for days. (Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater says the White House
received its first formal request Monday and assented the
next day.) As a mere "private" visitor, Mrs. Prunskiene was
also denied any U.S. security or transport. Her entourage had
to weave its own way through traffic in five $45-an-hour
rented sedans.
   Mr. Bush did give Mrs. Prunskiene 45 minutes, even
addressed her as "prime minister." Mr. Bush may refuse her
request for formal recognition, but he is unfailingly
cordial. If small captive nations were people, Mr. Bush would
invite each one for dinner and a movie, and hope there'd be
no hard feelings.
   Congress embraced Mrs. Prunskiene more eagerly, though
hardly with the acclaim accorded Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel.
Perhaps it's part of Congress's psyche to prefer winners to
long shots. Still, she had breakfast and lunch on the Hill,
and spoke before the body's Helsinki human rights commission,
framed by the American and the gold, green and red Lithuanian
flags.
   The only sour note came from Ed Markey, the Massachusetts
liberal, who lectured her for having the gall to endanger the
estimable Mr. Gorbachev. His performance had even senators
rolling their eyes and Lithuanians in the audience applauding
when Sen. James McClure, the Idaho Republican, begged to
differ. Mr. Markey is the sort who's a moralist about all
causes but the freedom of Balts or Russians; about that he's
a realist manque.
   The Markey malarkey at least had the virtue of candor
about Washington's probable intentions. No one wants to do
very much to help Mrs. Prunskiene. Even Dante Fascell, the
House Foreign Affairs Chairman who hosted breakfast for her,
mostly spoke of the things the U.S. couldn't do to help -- no
economic sanctions, no oil or gas sealift during the Soviet
embargo. His proposal to postpone the summit didn't fly with
Mr. Bush. Mrs. Prunskiene's cause may be just, but what she
wants is so very inconvenient.
