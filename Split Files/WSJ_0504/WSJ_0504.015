   SIDNEY, Ohio -- Monarch Machine Tool Co. expects to show a
substantial earnings rise for 1990, despite lower profit in
the first quarter, Robert J. Siewert, president, said.
   First-quarter net income fell to $222,205, or six cents a
share, from $521,789, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier,
Mr. Siewert said. Sales increased 13% to $25.1 million from
$22.2 million.

   "We fully expect to earn more than our dividend payout
this year," Mr. Siewert said. The company has been paying
quarterly dividends of 20 cents a share, or 80 cents
annually, all through the 1980s, even though it earned less
than that amount every year since 1982.
   Mr. Siewert said he expects directors to maintain the
dividend at the current rate.
   In 1989, Monarch earned $2 million, or 52 cents a share,
on sales of $96.7 million.
   The higher 1990 net will result from an increase in
shipments to at least $110 million, more efficient U.S.
production and improved results from the company's British
subsidiaries, Mr. Siewert said in an interview.
   The company's domestic machine tool divisions had delays
in shipments in the first quarter arising from scheduling
problems and introduction of new products, Mr. Siewert said.
Those problems are being corrected, he added.
   Monarch has an order backlog of $80.7 million, which will
support a higher shipment rate for the remainder of the year,
Mr. Siewert said.
   However, Monarch's machine tool orders weakened in March
and April, following a relatively good order level in January
and February, Mr. Siewert said. Orders for metal-cutting
lathes have been particularly slow in recent weeks, he said,
but orders for machining centers also slipped.
   "The encouraging thing is that the inquiry rate hasn't
dropped off as much as orders, and we aren't experiencing
cancellations," he added. Price increases averaging less than
5% on Monarch lathes earlier this year may have caused some
customers to order during January and February machines that
they otherwise would have ordered in March or April, he said.
However, "the market is soft," he added.
   Orders for metal coil processing equipment continue
strong, Mr. Siewert said. Both aluminum and steel processors
are ordering actively, he said.
   Because Monarch has a year's backlog of orders for coil
processing machinery, the company is expanding production
capacity by about 50%, Mr. Siewert said. The new facilities,
which are adjacent to the current plant at New Bremen, Ohio,
will go into production in July, he said.
   Monarch has decided to continue to produce general-purpose
lathes and machining centers, rather than retreat to some
market niche, he said. "I think we can compete with foreign
producers" with new machines the company has under
development. Some of the new machines will be introduced at
an international machine tool show in Chicago next September,
he said.
   The Japanese remain formidable competitors, however, Mr.
Siewert said. Imports, mainly from Japan, combined with
production in Japanese-owned transplant factories in the
U.S., captured 82% of the U.S. numerically controlled lathe
market last year, he estimates, leaving only 18% for Monarch
and other U.S. producers.
