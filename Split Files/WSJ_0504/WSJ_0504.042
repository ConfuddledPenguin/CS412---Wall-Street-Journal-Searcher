   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating possible insider trading in
connection with Genentech Inc.'s $2.1 billion plan to merge
with Swiss drug giant Roche Holding Ltd.
   The inquiry, triggered by an unusually high volume of
trading in the company's stock on the Pacific Stock Exchange,
focuses on a possible leak of insider information by the wife
of G. Kirk Raab, president and chief executive officer of the
biotechnology concern.

   In a move related to the merger, Genentech said its top
six officers were granted "golden parachute" agreements
awarding each a sum totaling five times their annual pay if
they lose their jobs in the merger. Mr. Raab's severance
package, should he leave Genentech, would equal $6.6 million.
His merger-related stock options, valued at $7.9 million,
would further enhance his windfall. The disclosures come at a
time when Genentech has said it will assume more of the
merger-related costs than previously thought.
   Genentech released the information as part of a detailed
merger plan, contained in a proxy statement filed with the
SEC and released to shareholders yesterday. The merger pact,
which also has been challenged by shareholder class action
lawsuits, must be approved by Genentech shareholders at a
meeting to be held on June 8. As reported, the plan would
leave Roche of Basel, Switzerland, holding 60% of Genentech,
with the option to acquire the remaining shares.
   The SEC investigation, according to Genentech, has been
under way since February. Mrs. Raab learned of the impending
merger from her husband before it was made public Feb. 2, and
is believed to have told a member of her family about it,
Genentech said in the proxy. That communication led to stock
trades by persons other than Mrs. Raab, who weren't
identified but who are apparently the probe's main targets,
Genentech indicated.
   Both Mr. and Mrs. Raab are cooperating with the SEC
inquiry, Genentech said. Genentech added it doesn't believe
the company or its chief executive are targets of any
investigation, and insisted Mr. Raab himself "exercised
proper care" in handling confidential information about the
merger. Mr. Raab declined to be interviewed, as did his wife.
   Genentech refused to provide further details of the
inquiry, citing an SEC ban on comment while an investigation
is in progress. The SEC also refused comment.
   "Even things we'd like to say in defense of Mrs. Raab,
we're precluded from saying," a Genentech spokesman said.
"It's not an investigation of Genentech or Kirk. But it
occurred around the {merger} deal so we felt compelled to
disclose it" in the proxy statement, he added.
   At the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco,
communications manager Roy Berces said the investigation
began Feb. 2 -- the same day the two companies stunned Wall
Street by announcing their intent to merge. Mr. Berces said
exchange officials became concerned about an unusually high
volume of call options, which are options to buy stock at a
fixed price. The trading involved some 8,000 contracts, each
involving 100 shares.
   The exchange spokesman declined to say on whose behalf the
trades were executed, explaining he was constrained from
commenting further by the SEC rule.
   The rich severance packages granted to top Genentech
officers were set at five times the amount of their annual
salary and bonus figures. These are larger than the typical
"golden parachute," which more often equals three times an
executive's annual compensation for tax reasons.
   Under terms of the deal, Robert Swanson, Genentech's
founder and chairman, would receive $6.3 million. James Gower
and William Young, both senior vice presidents, would get
$2.4 million and $2.2 million respectively. Louis Lavigne,
vice president and chief financial officer, and John
McLaughlin, vice president and general counsel, would each
receive just under $2 million.
   Nor do those amounts exhaust the benefits accruing to
Genentech's top officers as a result of the merger. Like all
Genentech employees, Genentech's officers will be given a
chance to cash out on their options holdings on an
accelerated schedule. As a result, Messrs. Swanson and Raab
stand to reap an additional $4.2 million and $7.9 million
respectively by cashing out. Options granted other top
officers sweeten their packages by $1.5 million to $2.4
million each.
   Analysts looking at the proxy statement remarked that, as
far as Roche's intent is concerned, "It's a done deal," said
Denise Gilbert of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. The
Swiss suitor formally indicated it will go forward with the
deal notwithstanding recent results of an Italian heart drug
trial rating Genentech's expensive cardiac drug TPA, costing
$2,000 a dose, as no better than its competitor drug, Hoechst
AG's streptokinase, which costs one-tenth as much.
   Ms. Gilbert also noted that Genentech had agreed to pick
up the cost of cashing out its employees' options. Under
terms of the pact, Genentech employees may sell 25% of
options that haven't yet matured. Previously, some on Wall
Street had assumed that Roche would pick up the tab for this
sweetener. However, according to the proxy, Genentech will
assume a cost of $115 million for the cash-out, Ms. Gilbert
noted.
   "That is to say, the shareholders will pay for it," she
added.
