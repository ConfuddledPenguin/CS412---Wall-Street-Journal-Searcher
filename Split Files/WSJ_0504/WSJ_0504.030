   NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Northeast Bancorp filed suit charging
that Bank of New York Co. breached its longstanding agreement
to purchase Northeast Bancorp for about $500 million.
   In the suit filed in federal district court here,
Northeast sought to compel Bank of New York to complete the
merger agreement or pay damages of not less than $350
million. Under the merger agreement, Bank of New York is
obligated to pay 250% of Northeast's book value. Northeast
charged in the suit that Bank of New York breached the merger
agreement by assigning a book value substantially lower than
Northeast's actual book value.

   The suit is the latest exchange in the quarrel between the
two banks. Earlier this week, Bank of New York accused the
Connecticut company of breaking the merger pact by failing to
maintain accurate records and threatened to terminate the
pact. Northeast said its books are in order and that Bank of
New York is attempting to avoid its contractual obligations.
   A Bank of New York spokesman said the company was
"disappointed" by the Northeast suit. "Although we continue
to prefer to resolve this matter by agreement, we are
confident that the courts will sustain the Bank of New York's
position that Northeast's books have materially overstated
its net worth," the spokesman said.
   In the suit, Northeast said that Bank of New York assigned
it a book value of $12.31 a share, as of Dec. 31, 1989, based
on a review of Northeast's loans. That figure was
substantially below the Dec. 31 book value of $36.40 for
Northeast shares. Northeast also charged that Bank of New
York's disparaging remarks about Northeast's record keeping
damaged Northeast's reputation and negatively affected the
market price of Northeast's stock.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Northeast
closed at $26.50 a share, down 50 cents. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, Bank of New York closed at
$30.875, up 12.5 cents.
