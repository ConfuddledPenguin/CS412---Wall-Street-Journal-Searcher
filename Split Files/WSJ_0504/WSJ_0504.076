   TORONTO -- Federated Stores Inc. pulled its Bloomingdale's
chain from the auction block, a move that observers and
analysts have been expecting since January.
   Federated, the Campeau Corp. unit that holds Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., said
retaining Bloomingdale's is in the best interests of its
creditors, customers and employees. Federated and Allied
sought protection from creditors in January under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Bloomingdale's had been up for
sale since early September, but the committee that was
supposed to spearhead the sale disbanded in January after
efforts to restructure Federated and Allied outside of
bankruptcy court failed.

   Federated said it intends to "aggressively" manage the
17-store chain to take advantage of its "future potential."
But Bloomingdale's potential for expansion is weak and that
was a big reason why Federated wasn't able to sell the
division at a price it wanted, said Kurt Barnard, publisher
of New York-based Retail Marketing Report, an industry
newsletter.
   "Bloomingdale's is a store that depends on a certain
panache that is associated with New York," Mr. Barnard said.
That makes it difficult to take the chain to other cities,
especially because U.S. retail customers are becoming more
conservative in their spending, he said.
   "Bloomingdale's will have to find an identity that is
captivating, but sets it apart from the crowd," he said.
   Federated's announcement comes little more than one week
after Investcorp International Inc. agreed to buy Saks Fifth
Avenue from B.A.T Industries PLC for $1.5 billion. It is
possible that Federated didn't want to be "deeply
embarrassed" by selling Bloomingdale's at a bargain-basement
price when Saks went for a price at which Campeau Corp.
Chairman Robert Campeau once bragged he could sell
Bloomingdale's, Mr. Barnard said.
   Federated officials won't say what bids, if any, were
received for Bloomingdale's, but industry observers say
offers may have been as low as $800 million. Janet Mangano,
analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co., said that Federated may have
decided to keep Bloomingdale's to avoid a huge tax liability.
Federated may be better off keeping Bloomingdale's and its
cash flow, which is the highest of Campeau's nine retail
chains, as it tries to restructure under bankruptcy law.
   Federated said "market circumstances" and Federated's
financial status have "changed significantly" since
Bloomingdale's was put up for sale. Mr. Barnard said
Federated management and creditors probably would have
preferred to sell Bloomingdale's if bids had topped $1
billion. Observers agreed that with Bloomingdale's back in
the Federated fold, it is likely that other Federated or
Allied assets will take its place on the auction block.
