   For the first time, scientists have grown human brain
cells in laboratory dishes, providing an invaluable tool to
study and possibly treat nerve disorders including
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
   The test-tube culturing of a colony of brain cells was
achieved by a team of neuroscientists at Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine in Baltimore. The original cells were obtained
during brain surgery on an 18-month-old girl who suffered a
severe, untreatable kind of seizure due to an enlarged brain,
the researchers reported in this week's issue of Science.

   Among the new research avenues opened up by the feat is
the possibility that the cultured brain cells can be
genetically altered and then transplanted into the brains of
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients as substitutes for the
damaged brain cells seen in these disorders. The Johns
Hopkins scientists are now attempting such genetic
alterations in the cultured cells, according to Solomon
Snyder, who heads the research team.
   The cultured brain cells also might provide insight into
how to get nerve cells in the spinal cord to regenerate, a
feat that would be a boon to tens of thousands of people
paralyzed by spinal-cord injuries. The cells also could be
used to test the efficacy and safety of drugs for brain
disorders, the scientists said.
   Human and animal cells cultured in laboratory dishes are a
backbone of medical research, allowing scientists to study
and experiment with tissues isolated from all the chemical
influences of the human body. Culturing of cells has led to
breakthroughs ranging from the Salk polio vaccine in the
mid-1950s, when scientists learned how to culture kidney
cells, to the discovery of the AIDS virus five years ago by
the use of cultures of human white blood cells.
   While cells of most human tissues can be cultured in the
laboratory, those from the brain and spinal cord, the
neurons, have heretofore resisted all attempts at test-tube
culture. To maintain cells in a lab dish, the cells must
repeatedly divide, and neurons simply don't divide. Even in a
human, the neurons, unlike all other cells, quit dividing at
or shortly after birth.
   Dr. Snyder said the cell-culture feat was conceived 3 1/2
years ago when one of his neuroscience graduate students,
Jeffrey S. Nye, became interested in a rare brain disorder
known as unilateral megalencephaly. In this disorder, infants
are born with one side of the brain larger than the other
side. One theory is that the neurons, which divide during
fetal life, are much slower to quit dividing on one side of
the brain than on the other side, Dr. Snyder explained.
   "Jeffrey put two and two together" and speculated that if
the neurons on the enlarged side of the brain were slow to
quit dividing, they might be forced to resume dividing in the
test tube, Dr. Snyder explained. Thus, Dr. Nye was standing
by almost two years ago when surgeons were removing part of
the enlarged brain from the 18-month-old girl. He took cells
from the removed gray matter -- the cerebral cortex, or outer
layer of the brain -- and immediately plunged them into a
nutrient broth used to maintain cells in culture.
   Most of the neurons died within three weeks, except for
two tiny colonies that have continued to divide for the last
19 months. One colony is the culture of cells described in
the report in Science.
   The cultured cells have all the appearance of being normal
neurons. Treatment with various nerve cell growth stimulators
triggers them to mature and begin developing the tiny
outgrowths that are characteristic of neurons, the scientists
said. The cells also produce a number of chemical nerve
transmitters produced by neurons in the body.
   Dr. Snyder said the medical school hasn't yet determined
which companies might be licensed to exploit the advance, or
whether Nova Pharmaceuticals Corp. would be among them. Dr.
Snyder is a founder and chief scientific adviser of Nova
Pharmaceutical. The research was supported by federal grants
and grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
