   EURO DISNEYLAND'S PLANS

   Euro Disneyland SCA has decided to increase the total
estimated investment for the first phase of construction of
the theme park outside Paris to 16.3 billion francs ($2.88
billion) from 14.9 billion francs, Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer John H. Forsgren said.
   Mr. Forsgren said the 9.4% rise in funds allocated to the
period of construction that terminates when the park opens in
the spring of 1992 will be used to expand capacity by 15%
through the addition of new attractions. He said Euro
Disneyland will raise the additional 1.4 billion francs
through a combination of cash resources and bank financing.
   The executive noted that the company hasn't revised its
estimated attendance level of 11 million visitors during the
first year of operation, nor has it upgraded its earnings or
income projections for the park. "We aren't increasing our
attendance figure in the first year, but we're positive about
exceeding {subsequent projections} if the demand is there,
and we feel it will be there."
   Euro Disneyland has no current plans to tap the equity
markets for more financing, Mr. Forsgren said. "The company
is very well-financed with our current equity base," he said.
                                                                                                       

   NO WELCOME IN HONG KONG
                                                                                                       

   Hong Kong is unlikely to allow the Goddess of Democracy
ship to enter its waters and take on provisions before
broadcasting dissidents' messages to China, an official of
the British colony said. The vessel's spokesman said
Wednesday in Singapore that the ship would seek permission
from Hong Kong to take on a transmitter, food, fuel and
water. The ship had been previously scheduled to stop in
Taiwan to refuel, but the spokesman said it turned out that
no ship agency in Taiwan wants to help with provisioning.
Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
                                                                                                       

   BOOST FOR BELGIUM
                                                                                                       

   German unification should provide a shot in the arm for
Belgium's economy, according to a study by the Banque
Nationale de Belgique. Increased demand in East Germany as
consumers acquire new buying power as well as investments in
infrastructure and new industries should fuel a boom in
Belgian exports, the study said. The growth in exports will
boost Belgium's external surplus and stimulate employment,
the study concluded.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINE EMERGENCY ORDER
                                                                                                       

   The Philippines goes on daylight-saving time May 21 to
further conserve electricity, the presidential palace
announced. President Corazon Aquino signed a
national-emergency order for energy conservation and directed
the Office of Energy Affairs to put out the guidelines. When
the order goes into effect, the Philippines will advance its
official clock one hour for both government and private
sectors. The new measure comes three weeks after the
government called for a four-day work week to save
electricity.
                                                                                                       

   HELP FROM NORTH KOREA
                                                                                                       

   South Korean's Ssangyong Cement Industrial Co. signed a
contract to import 120,000 tons of cement from North Korea.
Company officials said the North Korean cement would be
imported by June at the latest through a Hong Kong trading
firm. South and North Korea, bitter rivals, do not trade
goods directly. South Korea faces a serious cement shortfall
this year because of a construction boom.
                                                                                                       

   FIGHTING RACISM IN FRANCE
                                                                                                       

   France's National Assembly approved a bill that would bar
anyone who provokes racial hatred or violence from holding
elected office and government jobs for five years. The bill,
targeted at the extreme-right National Front party, was
passed by the Assembly 307-265; it now goes to the Senate,
where it can be revised before being returned to the lower
house. It must be signed by President Francois Mitterrand to
become law.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN AIRLINE ALLIANCE
                                                                                                       

   Swissair, Austrian Airlines, Finnair and Scandinavian
Airlines System announced an agreement to cooperate in such
areas as customer service, marketing, sales and technical
fields.
   The announcement said the four companies will coordinate
schedules and are considering a joint cargo center in Vienna,
as well as check-in collaboration at various airports.
   Together, the four airlines carried 30 million passengers
last year on 250 aircraft. The alliance will make the group
of airlines the leading conveyer of air-passenger traffic
between East and West Europe, according to the announcement.
   Swissair President Otto Loepfe was quoted as saying that
"by working together, we can have an influential say in the
technical specifications for new aircraft, especially when it
comes to exhaust emission and noise-reduction criteria."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Beginning this Sunday, May 6, London's telephone system
will have two new areas codes -- 71 for inner London and 81
for outer London -- in place of the familiar 1. A call from
the U.S. will involve dialing 011 (international code), 44
(country code), 71 or 81 (city code) plus the seven-digit
number. . . . Prisoners in a Bathurst, Australia, jail broke
into an office during a guards' strike and ordered 312 pizzas
to be delivered from a local Pizza Hut outlet. One hundred
and forty had been delivered -- in three cars -- before
guards canceled the rest of the order.
