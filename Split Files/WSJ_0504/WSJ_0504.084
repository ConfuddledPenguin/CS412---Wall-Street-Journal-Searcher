   WASHINGTON -- The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved
a bill that would give the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
greater access to Western high-technology than the Bush
administration is prepared to offer.
   The bill would eliminate all export controls from
computers and other high-technology products that the U.S.
and other industrialized democracies currently ship to China
and would thus make those products available to the Soviet
Union and certain Eastern European countries as well.

   The White House is proposing to offer to sell to the
Soviets computers that are only half as powerful as those
being sold to China. And the administration is insisting that
Eastern European countries that want to import the more
powerful computers must agree to certain safeguards against
the unauthorized use of those products.
   The House bill also contains a so-called sunset provision
that would terminate controls on all 120 currently restricted
product categories by Oct. 1, 1992, unless the administration
deems it necessary for security reasons to reinstate those
restrictions.
   The U.S. can't change such export-control rules unless it
does so in concert with other allies. The U.S. and its allies
are scheduled to discuss potentially significant changes in
these rules at a high-level meeting of the Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Controls, or Cocom, in Paris next
month.
   The Bush administration said it is opposed to much of the
House committee's legislation, claiming that its own
proposal, announced Wednesday, is a more effective way of
responding to political changes in Europe. The Senate Banking
Committee, which has jurisdiction over export regulations,
said it won't be ready to begin work on a comparable bill
until next month.
   The computer industry expressed support for the House
bill, saying that it addresses the market potential in
Eastern Europe more effectively than the White House plan.
   "It's a bold and necessary step," said Marian Korenz, the
spokeswoman of the Computer and Business Equipment
Manufacturers Association.
   The Electronic Industries Association, although supportive
of the bill, said it could be improved if it made a clearer
distinction between the so-called dual-use products that have
both civilian and military applications and those that are
more properly classified as weapons. The electronics industry
is concerned that the State Department and the Pentagon,
which are responsible for clearing weapons exports, sometimes
intrude unnecessarily in the licensing of dual-use items.
   The House bill also would create a "license-free zone" in
Cocom by Sept. 30, 1991. Such an arrangement would enable
technology producers in the 17 Cocom countries to exchange
goods without any licenses. Although licensing requirements
for inter-Cocom trade has been reduced in recent years, the
computer industry is urging that such paper work be
eliminated except for the most sensitive products.
   The bill also provides for other benefits for exporters,
including giving them notice of decisions by Cocom, which
operates for the most part in secrecy, and periodic reviews
to trim the list of controlled items. The House proposal,
moreover, would give a Cocom seat to the Commerce Department,
which is directed to weigh both national security and
competitiveness needs. Currently, the State Department does
most of the negotiating for the U.S. in Cocom.
