   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Genetics Institute Inc. said it and
Baxter Healthcare Corp. submitted final clinical test data
for Recombinate, a genetically engineered antihemophiliac
drug.
   A Genetics spokeswoman said the FDA usually takes 12 to 18
months to evaluate such submissions.

   Recombinate is a genetically engineered form of the
blood-clotting protein Factor VIII, which is used to treat
hemophilia, a condition that afflicts more than 50,000 males
world-wide, Genetics said.
   "We believe that people with hemophilia are eagerly
anticipating approval by the FDA of Recombinate as an
alternative replacement for existing plasma-derived
products," said Gabriel Schmergel, president and chief
executive officer of Genetics Institute.
   Genetics Institute cloned and developed the drug, and it
will supply a significant portion of Baxter's continuing
commercial requirements.
   Baxter, Genetics Institute's licensing partner, is
responsible for the clinical development, final manufacture
and world-wide marketing of Recombinate.
   In 1988, Genetics Institute was granted a U.S. patent for
the process to make recombinant Factor VIII, which it said is
one of the largest proteins ever produced using genetic
engineering techniques. In March 1989, Genetics Institute and
Baxter announced a world-wide patent cross-licensing
agreement concerning recombinant Factor VIII with Genentech
Inc. and Miles Inc.
