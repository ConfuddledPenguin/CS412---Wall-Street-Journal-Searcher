   This week marks the 15th anniversary of the fall of
Saigon. Following is a statement by three Americans whose
lives were touched by the Vietnam War. All have spent much of
the past 15 years in Asia. Arthur Kobler is a Foreign Service
officer in Singapore. W. Gage McAfee is an attorney with an
international law firm in Hong Kong and Warren Williams heads
a public affairs consultancy in Hong Kong.

   Like most Americans in their 40s and 50s, our lives were
scarred by the Vietnam War. We were among those who went to
Vietnam -- one a diplomat, another an AID lawyer, the third a
Special Forces officer -- persuaded that our national
objectives in pursuing the war were fundamentally correct.
Fifteen years ago, two of us worked on the Embassy evacuation
in Vietnam: one left on a helicopter from the roof of the
Embassy, another on the last Air Vietnam flight. The third
worked on the evacuation from Tokyo. We were all shattered by
the collapse of the American effort.
   Whichever side one took during the war, much has happened
since then that should have provoked rethinking the war
experience. Yet, despite the disintegration of communism, the
rise of regional powers and events that have forced us to
redraw the global strategic map, the American view of Vietman
remains frozen in a time warp.
   For the sake of our national peace of mind, the American
people must finally come to terms with the meaning of the
war. Only then will the U.S. be prepared to assess
dispassionately the national interest and shape a balanced
policy, motivated neither by penance nor revenge.
   According to popular mythology, the U.S. fought the
Vietnam War on the wrong side, and our soldiers went there to
kill innocent people and smoke pot. Our pop culture --
exemplified by films like "Platoon" and "Born on the Fourth
of July" -- panders to this distorted perception. As a
result, most Americans continue to wallow in guilt,
bitterness and unreconciled hostility toward Vietnam. Most
Americans are also astoundingly unaware of what has happened
in Southeast Asia during the past 25 years.
   The Vietnam War, like all wars, wreaked awful devastation.
Of that, no one can be proud -- Vietnamese or American.
Nevertheless, the transcending legacy of the U.S. war effort
is profoundly constructive: It is the growing prosperity and
vitality of the 300 million people who live in Southeast Asia
outside of Indochina and Burma. That compelling truth,
self-evident to many in this region, including most
eloquently Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, still seems
lost on the majority of Americans.
   Too few of us recall how tenuous this region's equilibrium
was in the early 1960s. Virtually every country was beset by
a virulent communist movement that threatened stability and
development: Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the
Philippines. Today, Southeast Asia is the fastest growing
region in the world, and one of immense importance to our own
economy and national security. There are surely many reasons
for its remarkable success, including strong national
leadership, sound policies and access to U.S. markets. But
all these positive elements would have been nullified had the
U.S. not made a determined stand in Vietnam and steadfastly
continued to this day to guarantee the security of this vast
region. Those sustained efforts eased insurgent pressure on
the rest of Southeast Asia and provided breathing space to
achieve stability and growth.
   In retrospect, the unraveling of the war effort in South
Vietnam in 1975 was not the conclusive event it seemed to us
at the time. By 1990 it has become clear that the basic
objective of U.S. policy in Indochina -- safeguarding the
security and promoting the prosperity of Southeast Asia --
was splendidly achieved.
   Moreover, yet another paradox has emerged: Communist
Indochina itself is awakening to the stark reality of its own
failed revolution and is slowly groping toward principles it
once scorned -- open markets, private property, pluralism.
This awakening is surely painful and hesitant, but no less
inevitable than the dramatic transformation we have witnessed
in Eastern Europe.
   On this 15th anniversary of the fall of the Saigon, it is
fitting to set the record straight, to re-examine this
episode in our history -- not only the grief it caused, but
also its significance for Asia and for America's vital
interests. This process is an essential step in restoring the
dignity and honor of 55,000 American servicemen who perished
in the war and of millions of Vietnam veterans, South
Vietnamese and American. History has vindicated their
sacrifices.
