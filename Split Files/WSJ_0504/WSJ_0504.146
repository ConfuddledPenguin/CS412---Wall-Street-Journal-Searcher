   NEW YORK -- A.C. Nielsen Co. yesterday told executives
from the television networks and advertising agencies that it
has no idea why its recent TV ratings show a sharp decline in
television viewing.
   Nielsen ratings, which dictate how billions of dollars are
spent on television advertising each year, indicate that TV
viewing is down 8.1% for daytime programming, off 2.2% in
prime time and is down a sharp 14% for nightly newscasts for
the three networks in recent months.

   Nielsen, which met privately with about 100 members of the
advertising and broadcast community in a 90-minute session at
a New York hotel yesterday, pledged to research the ratings
drop further. But some executives remain dissatisfied. "I
don't feel Nielsen has given us anything new," said Michael
Eisenberg, a vice president at CBS Inc. "We still think there
really is a problem."
   Executives of Nielsen, a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. unit,
declined to comment on the meeting yesterday, although one
conceded privately that the "magnitude of these changes {in
viewing} is the largest in recent memory and warrants serious
examination."
   Even ad executives, who in the past have tended to dismiss
the network complaints about the Nielsen people meters,
express concern at the latest numbers. "There is a fly in the
ointment," said Joel M. Segal, executive vice president at
the ad agency McCann-Erickson, a unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos. "It's madness. We can't figure out {the demographics}
we're buying."
