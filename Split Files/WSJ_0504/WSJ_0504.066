   WASHINGTON -- President Bush, in a move as important for
its political symbolism as its military substance, said the
U.S. would scrap plans to put new short-range nuclear
missiles in Western Europe.
   Mr. Bush also announced the U.S. is prepared to open talks
with the Soviet Union more quickly than previously planned on
cutting existing short-range nuclear missiles. And he
declared that the U.S. won't put new nuclear artillery shells
into Western Europe.

   "As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops
return home, there is less need for nuclear systems of the
shortest range," Mr. Bush said at a news conference. He also
called for a meeting of leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization this summer to talk about broader questions of
European security in the wake of the past year's changes in
Eastern Europe.
   The president's steps, which Secretary of State James
Baker disclosed to America's European allies at a meeting in
Brussels at the same time Mr. Bush announced them here,
amounts to an attempt to get political mileage out of
disarmament steps that had become inevitable.
   Support had collapsed in both West Germany and in the U.S.
Congress for building the new short-range nuclear missiles,
which would be a modernized version of the existing Lance
missile. The missiles, which were to be based on German soil,
seemed anachronistic because they would be targeted at East
European countries that have shed their Communist governments
in the last year.
   Moreover, with East Germany and West Germany rushing
toward unification, there is little chance leaders of either
country would tolerate the deployment of new nuclear-tipped
artillery shells anywhere in Germany, as once anticipated.
   While the steps Mr. Bush announced are being forced on
him, the administration thinks that packaging them as a new
American initiative gives Washington a better chance of
steering the rapid changes in Europe. By formally dropping
plans for new short-range nuclear weapons, and particularly
by accelerating talks on removing existing weapons, Mr. Bush
hopes to keep up with public opinion in Western Europe. He
also hopes to prevent a Soviet campaign to quickly drive all
nuclear weapons out of Western Europe.
   In addition, U.S. officials hope that announcement of the
disarmament moves now will help ease some of the Soviet
Union's fears about allowing a new, unified Germany to become
a full-fledged member of NATO, the Western military alliance.
The U.S. badly wants the new Germany firmly planted in the
Western camp, but Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has
repeatedly objected to that idea.
   The U.S. previously had been planning to hold talks
eventually with the Soviet Union on cuts in short-range
nuclear missiles. But until yesterday's announcement, the
Bush administration hadn't been planning to open the talks
until a treaty slashing U.S. and Soviet conventional forces
in Europe was completed and was being implemented -- probably
around 1992.
   Mr. Bush now is declaring that he's ready to open talks
with the Soviets on short-range nuclear weapons as soon as
the conventional arms treaty is finished -- probably this
fall -- without waiting for it to be implemented.
   More broadly, the president's message is that the future
of nuclear weapons in the new Europe should be worked out
jointly by the U.S. and its allies, and shouldn't be decided
precipitously. "The future of the United States cannot be
separated from the future of Europe," Mr. Bush said. "And so,
along with our allies, we must prepare for the magnificent
opportunities that lie ahead."
   But actually agreeing with the Soviets on reductions in
short-range nuclear weapons won't be easy. Such weapons were
left untouched by the accord Mr. Gorbachev and former
President Reagan signed in 1987 to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   One sticking point in the new negotiations will be the
Bush administration's hope to maintain an arsenal of nuclear
weapons carried on planes even as ground-based nuclear
weapons are cut.
   In addition, it isn't clear whether the U.S. is willing to
negotiate cuts in existing nuclear-tipped artillery shells as
well as nuclear missiles. And Mr. Bush didn't say whether the
ultimate American goal is reduction or elimination of
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   On a related issue, Mr. Bush again defended his decision
not to impose sanctions on the Soviet Union for its crackdown
in Lithuania, and said he is glad Lithuania's leaders are
indicating a willingness to suspend some laws they passed to
buttress their declaration of independence from the Soviet
Union.
   Mr. Bush said he considers it "very, very positive" that
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis has shown interest
in a proposal from France and Germany that Lithuania suspend
the effects of some of its new laws in hopes of launching
negotiations with the Kremlin. Mr. Bush spoke just before
meeting privately with the prime minister of the
self-proclaimed Lithuanian government, Kazimiera Prunskiene.
The White House meeting was Mr. Bush's first direct contact
with a leader of Lithuania's independence movement.
   The president insisted that he wasn't choosing between
siding with Mr. Gorbachev or Lithuania. "Of course, we favor
self-determination" for Lithuania, Mr. Bush said. "I don't
think that's new, my saying that. And of course, we favor
democracy and freedom."
   But Mr. Bush again implied that he considered securing
agreements with Mr. Gorbachev on issues such as getting
Soviet troops out of Eastern Europe so important that the
issue of Lithuania shouldn't interfere with that effort.
"There's a lot at stake in all of this," he said. "There's
complications in all of this. Poland, Eastern Europe -- I
want those troops out. And I want to see the firming up of
the democracies in Eastern Europe."
