   INDIANAPOLIS -- Bindley Western Industries Inc. said it
reached an agreement with Peyton Distributors, a unit of
Kroger Co., to be the primary supplier of pharmaceuticals to
Peyton.
   The drug wholesaler said the agreement, effective last
Tuesday, is expected to add revenue of more than $150 million
annually. In 1989, Bindley had revenue of $1.56 billion.

   Bindley also said that as a result of its strategies to
improve performance and the continued growth of
pharmaceutical sales, it is "comfortable with {Wall} Street
expectations" for the current year. The company said analysts
are currently forecasting per-share earnings of 85 cents for
1990, compared with 41 cents in 1989.
