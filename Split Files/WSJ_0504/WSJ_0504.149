   TUSTIN, Calif. -- CMS Enhancements Inc. said directors
approved a plan under which the company would buy back as
much as nearly 5% of its common stock outstanding.
   CMS, a maker and distributor of a broad line of
enhancement products for personal computers, said it feels
its stock is undervalued. In December, in an effort to boost
the stock price and attract institutional investors, CMS
holders approved a 1-for-4 stock split, reducing shares
outstanding to about 3.2 million from about 12.6 million.
