   MOUNT KISKO, N.Y. -- Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl
Icahn is threatening to transfer many of the carrier's
domestic operations to America West Airlines unless the
pilots union makes concessions, officials at the pilots union
said.
   In a Tuesday meeting, first reported in the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, Mr. Icahn and officials of the TWA pilots and
machinists unions met with America West President Mike Conway
at Mr. Icahn's offices here to discuss the action, the union
said.

   America West is a small Phoenix-based airline that is
mostly nonunion. It wasn't clear what if anything America
West would pay for TWA's operations.
   It's also uncertain how serious Mr. Icahn is about the
move. The pilots and Mr. Icahn have been feuding over wage
concessions for months. He has been threatening to trim the
airline if the pilots don't accept $80 million in
concessions. He has already sold several planes. After the
Tuesday meeting, however, union officials continued to rebuff
Mr. Icahn.
   Officials at America West and TWA's machinists union
weren't available for comment. Mr. Icahn didn't return calls
to his home.
   Pilots union officials said they were presented with a
plan for America West to assume TWA's St. Louis hub of
operations. Union officials said details were sketchy.
   TWA relies primarily on its international operations and
has struggled for several years to establish a strong
domestic system that could feed overseas routes. Pilots union
officials told members that Mr. Icahn said he plans to sell
the airline's international routes after America West assumes
control of the domestic operations.
   Although Mr. Icahn has alluded to such a proposal in
recent weeks, this was said to be the first time he formally
presented it.
