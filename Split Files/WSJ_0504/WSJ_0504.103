   A difficult first quarter for the airline industry
resulted in steep losses at two of the most troubled
carriers, Texas Air Corp. and Pan Am Corp.
   They were the last in the industry to report results. Hit
by high fuel costs, eight of 10 U.S. airline holding
companies posted losses.

   Houston-based Texas Air, buffeted by losses at its Eastern
Airlines unit and by the fuel cost increases, had a net loss
of $107.1 million, or $2.80 a share. A year earlier, a strike
and Chapter 11 filing at Eastern pushed the parent's loss to
$255.5 million, or $6.56 a share. Revenue fell 1.1% to $1.86
billion from $1.89 billion.
   Texas Air said its operating loss narrowed to $92.5
million from $174 million.
   The company said the deficits, which were expected, were
attributable to the problems at Eastern. While Eastern, still
in bankruptcy court, narrowed its loss, revenue declined 10%.
The loss narrowed to $136.5 million on revenue of $557.2
million from the year-earlier $255.2 million on revenue of
$620.6 million. Eastern has blamed the lower revenue on its
inability to attract high-paying business travelers, who were
scared off by the labor unrest.
   Such markedly lower revenue was one reason Eastern's
unsecured creditors last month pushed to oust Texas Air from
its day-to-day management of Eastern and a bankruptcy judge
appointed a trustee to run the airline. Texas Air said that
under generally accepted accounting principles, Eastern's
results will be excluded from Texas Air's future operating
results.
   Texas Air's other unit, Continental Airlines, recorded a
profit of $21.3 million, mostly the result of a one-time gain
of $69.7 million from settlement of a lawsuit. Continental
had a loss of $16.5 million a year earlier.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Texas Air stock rose 12.5 cents to $6.50.
   In New York, Pan Am said its net loss widened to $190.7
million, or $1.29 a share, from $151.1 million, or $1.05 a
share, a year earlier.
   Although Pan Am's loss was slightly greater than what Wall
Street analysts were expecting, industry observers said they
were encouraged by a 15% surge in revenue to $845.8 million
from $733.5 million. The jump was among the largest by major
carriers in the quarter.
   "They regained some of their first-class and
business-class business," said John Eichner, chairman of
Simat, Hellisen and Eichner Inc., a New York-based airline
consulting firm.
   Many customers jittery from the December 1988 Pan Am crash
over Lockerbie, Scotland, are just returning to the carrier,
Mr. Eichner said.
   Despite a positive outlook for the second and third
quarters, the best period for Pan Am's big transatlantic
business, the carrier is still under the gun.
   "The pressure is still on them," said Mr. Eichner, noting
that Pan Am is likely to face more troubles in the fourth
quarter, when its traffic typically falters.
   Pan Am struggled through a difficult winter. Pan Am was
bruised by fuel and oil costs 36% higher than a year earlier.
They rose to $171.1 million from $126.2 million. This
contributed to a 15% rise in the operating expenses to $995.8
million from $862.2 million.
   Pan Am also cited aircraft and ground rentals among its
biggest expenses. It said these costs rose largely because of
an increase in fleet size to 165 jets from 141.
   In the quarter, the carrier was forced to obtain
agreements with three big creditors to postpone the start of
collection of $106.4 million in bills until later this year.
   Pan Am stock rose 12.5 cents to close at $2.75 a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
