   Your April 9 editorial "Owls Are People, Too" arrived at
exactly the wrong conclusion about the effectiveness of our
political system. It is functioning exactly as it was
intended to. The people have had it with extinction.
Extinction of the Carolina parakeet, extinction of the condor
in the wild, extinction of the ivory-billed woodpecker, the
passenger pigeon. So they got their act together and took a
leaf from industry's, labor's and agriculture's book and
formed a pressure group of their own. We are a government by
pressure groups.

   You lament the potential loss of 9,000 to 60,000 logging
jobs. If it were not for the Forest Service's giveaway of
timber assets owned by all of the American people, many of
these jobs wouldn't have existed to begin with. This welfare
program, conducted under the guise of timber leasing, results
in the demeaning of the value of timber owned by individuals
and corporations. Here in the East, despite an abundance of
quality timber, builders still use lower-quality timber from
the Northwest because of its subsidized, cheap price.

   The Forest Service routinely runs deficits of about a
billion dollars a year in its timber operations. So you and
I, the taxpayers, are subsidizing the destruction of our
national forests.

   Every logger and timber-industry dependent is an
environmentalist. The ground they work is their livelihood.
Most of these people are avid outdoorsmen, caring for their
surroundings. We need the forest-products industry. The U.S.
is dependent upon this industry for products ranging from
framing lumber to tissue paper, computer paper to cleaning
solvents. The products derived from timber make our world a
better place. We need a constant supply of timber.

   I have hiked these forests more than 50 years and there
has never been so much of the state treeless. Now we have
areas that require an advance reservation to take an
overnight hike. And you can't get a reservation. There are
other jobs at stake. The outdoor equipment and sports
companies generate jobs. The "multiple-use" policy of the
Forest Service is a single-use policy when the forest is
given to logging.

   The lumber industry in the Pacific Northwest is the major
supplier of high-quality construction lumber for most of the
U.S., and a major supplier to the entire Pacific Rim.
Wood-products sales from here are a major favorable item in
the balance of trade. Virtually everyone involved in the
forest-products industry is very concerned with the state of
our forests, and the wildlife it supports.
   In Oregon at least, there are now many more new trees
planted each year than are cut; there is more board footage
of new timber growing than is cut.
   Everyone here and everywhere knows the cutting of a
magnificent, 80-year-old tree is very sad. The planting of a
new seedling in its place seems inadequate next to the huge
stump. People who live in and around the woods are more
sensitive to this than those who look at the photos in a
slick fund-raising brochure.
   The people who live here are the loggers, and forest road
builders and sawmill workers and truckers and grocers and
doctors and lawyers and longshoremen, but we are also the
most prolific of pleasure users of the forests. You can bet
that those who work here would be blocking the roads and
joining hands to save the trees if they were being cut merely
to clear land. You should hear the negative local comments
when some "Easterner" moves in and cuts down a big tree in
his yard merely to enhance his view of the ocean.

   Even if we locked up enormous areas to protect the owl, we
would eventually fail. We cannot convert a natural system
into a museum where nothing changes. All the nature shows on
TV and the news photos of Hurricane Hugo and Mount St. Helens
hammer home the lesson that, in all environments, change is
constant and inexorable. The habitats that are now thought to
be favorable to the owl will sooner or later become
unfavorable.

   If it is so important for Rep. Jim Jontz and other
environmentalists to protect the habitat of the spotted owl
then I suggest the citizens of Indiana and other states share
in the cost that the citizens of Oregon now bear alone.
(After all, the Indiana corn growers are paid through
farm-support programs.) It seems only fair that the whole
nation shares the cost of relocation of families, job
training and welfare that will be caused by this act.

   We share the planet with animals but not as one of them.
Yes, the environment must be managed, but the needs of people
on a one-to-one basis must be considered above the rights of
seeing a particular species in abundance. People cannot be
herded into territories by the needs of animals and put on
the public dole because of an owl species.
   Unless saneness replaces scientific fanaticism all sense
of respect will be lost to the environmentalists.

   Your editorial about the spotted owl further exacerbates
the tension between those who do and those who do not want to
save some of our little remaining old forests. It is
unfortunate that it had to become a legal question of saving
owls, when the more important issue is to deter the lumber
industry from completely ravaging the balance of America's
old forests. It's wrong to continue the last cutting of our
200-year-old monarchs, either with or without the inhabiting
owls.
