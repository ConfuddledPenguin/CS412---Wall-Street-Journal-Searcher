   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- As John Hall drives his
well-traveled Buick coupe past his former office at Micro
Power Systems Inc., he can only stare wistfully at its
handsome Spanish-colonial front. The semiconductor pioneer
founded Micro Power and invested 15 of his most productive
years in it. In the process, he gave his Japanese partners,
the Seiko group, a huge head start in advanced chip
technology.
   Then, his world crashed around him.

   Seiko, the big watch and personal-computer maker, fired
him. He lost control of the company and the technology he had
spent so long developing. He poured almost all his savings
into suing his former associates at Seiko. His old company
countersued him, warned customers of his fledgling new
company against doing business with him and charged him with
stealing trade secrets. His Japanese wife, a former Tokyo
nightclub hostess, left him.
   Now, financially and emotionally exhausted, he has agreed
to settle his complaint for just a fraction of the $110
million in damages he originally sought.
   The 57-year-old engineer is a bear of a man, but his voice
quavers a bit as he relates his story. As he tells it, he was
preparing to take Micro Power public in mid-1986 when Seiko,
fearful of losing unfettered access to his technology, ousted
him and shooed off prospective underwriters.
   He flew to Tokyo for a face-to-face meeting with Ichiro
Hattori, then Seiko's president, to negotiate his termination
settlement. As Mr. Hattori spoke in his mahogany-paneled
suite, his words chilled Mr. Hall to the bone. "He said he
controlled enough wealth in this world to win any lawsuit he
should be forced into," Mr. Hall recalls. Undeterred, Mr.
Hall returned to Santa Clara and sued Seiko in state court
here.
   Mr. Hall's discharge and more than three years of
litigation provide a startling counterpoint to American
entrepreneurs' current enthusiasm for high-tech partnerships
fueled by low-cost Japanese capital. Of course, Silicon
Valley offers many examples of smoothly operating
U.S.-Japanese joint ventures. But, noting that they are
almost all younger than his operation, Mr. Hall says the
Americans in those ventures may eventually wind up not so
enchanted with their partners.
   "The Japanese don't always honor their obligations," he
charges. "They'd strip American companies of their
technology, send it back to Japan and use it to increase
their own sales in the U.S."
   That accusation hasn't been proved. But Mr. Hall's tale
certainly challenges the image of Japanese executives as
eager to avoid litigation at all costs. Seiko has spent
millions of dollars fighting the case.
   "Mr. Hall made an unreasonable demand, and we did nothing
wrong," contends Tsuneto Enami, the managing director of
Seiko Instruments Inc., one of Seiko's four major units.
"What we want is an end {to the court suit} with an
understanding that we did nothing wrong."
   Finally, Mr. Hall's tale illustrates the difficulties of
cross-cultural partnerships. Seiko tried to turn a brilliant
engineer from West Virginia into a Japanese corporate
loyalist. Mr. Hall tried to go along. But when tough problems
arose, Mr. Hall reacted like many an American and sued.
Seiko, feeling betrayed, lashed back.
   There was little in Mr. Hall's background to prepare him
emotionally for his immersion in a Japanese corporate family.
In the early 1960s, the shy young engineer focused on
semiconductor devices and quickly became a hot ticket for his
work at General Electric Co., Honeywell Inc. and Union
Carbide Corp.
   In 1967, working at Intersil Inc. with another industry
wizard, Jean Hoerni, he won his first job for Seiko. The
Japanese watchmakers asked him if he could design a tiny chip
for their new quartz models. The engineers at one unit, Seiko
Epson Corp., doubted it could be done. In nine months, he
says, he delivered the devices.
   Seiko asked Mr. Hall to come work in Japan. But he didn't
want to give up his dream of founding his own semiconductor
company. Eventually, they struck a compromise and started a
joint venture in Santa Clara, calling it Micro Power.
   Seiko still wanted to make Mr. Hall one of its own. So,
before starting the venture, it took him to Tokyo in the fall
of 1970. For half a year, he tutored Seiko engineers by day
and drank with them by night. He soon became a trusted
sword-bearer for the Hattori family, taken along to the
geisha houses where crucial business deals are struck.
Masukatsu Hamamoto, a Seiko executive whose career included
interpreting for Hideki Tojo, Japan's wartime prime minister,
became his mentor.
   Mr. Hall quickly learned that Seiko, one of Japan's
largest privately held corporate empires, was divided into
bitterly competing fiefs. Two of its companies, Seiko
Instruments and Seiko Epson, make watches for world-wide
distribution by Hattori Seiko Co., the group's only publicly
traded company. Yet the two units compete at selling other
products, such as printers and robotic equipment, in the U.S.
"That was mostly Shoji's doing," says Mr. Hall, referring to
Ichiro Hattori's father, who made Seiko a global force in
watchmaking. "He thought that competition brought out the
best in his companies."
   Because Mr. Hall was brought into the group by Seiko
Instruments, his relations with Seiko Epson were chilly from
the start. In addition, he says, Seiko Epson engineers had
"lost face" because he had bested them with his fast delivery
of innovative watch chips.
   Epson denigrated Mr. Hall's work as trivial. But Pentagon
analysts trace Seiko's upsurge in the powerful computer
chips, called complementary metal oxide semiconductors, to
his time in Japan in the early 1970s. "Before that, they had
nothing. But after Hall, they had a lot," one Defense
Department chip expert says.
   Two powerful personal forces entered Mr. Hall's life in
Japan. One was Fumiyo Endo, an entertainer at the Mikado, a
glamorous theater-restaurant and favorite watering hole of
Tokyo businessmen. Mr. Hall left his wife, set up Ms. Endo in
an apartment and eventually married her.
   The other new force was Ichiro Hattori, the president of
both Seiko Epson and Seiko Instruments. Though about the same
age, the two men differed greatly. Mr. Hall is a soft-spoken
introvert at ease only in his workshop; Mr. Hattori, who died
three years ago, was a handsome, charming aristocrat; at
school, he had been a tennis partner of the Japanese emperor.
He also was a Yale-educated internationalist who was proud of
the 1,800 jobs that Seiko had created in the U.S. and who
urged other Japanese businessmen to be "good neighbors" with
the Americans. Yet, in private, Mr. Hattori was "autocratic
and impulsive," Mr. Hall recalls.
   After opening for business in 1971, almost alone amid
Santa Clara's orange groves and tomato farms, Micro Power
grew along with the business of making analog integrated
circuits, which measure light, heat, sound and other physical
properties (unlike digital devices, which simply count).
Micro Power's sales soared from about $250,000 in 1972 to
more than $25 million in 1985; analog devices now account for
20% of the semiconductor market.
   Mr. Hall made chips for Sharp Corp.'s first hand-held
calculators and a low-power chip for Medtronic Inc. that
could run a pacemaker for 10 years in a patient's chest
without maintenance. But best-known were his designs for the
use of molybdenum or tungsten gates to interconnect the
multitude of transistors in semiconductor devices. His
patents for molybdenum gates are assigned to Micro Power and
thus effectively under the control of Seiko, the majority
owner of Micro Power. Mr. Hall contends that the patents
eventually could be worth as much as $10 billion; Seiko
values them in the low millions.
   Mr. Hall also supplied high-performance chips to two
"Stars Wars" contractors, Aerojet-General Corp. and Hughes
Aircraft Co. One of Micro Power's biggest sales was $7
million of modules for the B-1 bomber's phased-array radar,
he says.
   His very success with technology, Mr. Hall believes,
sparked his dispute with Seiko. In 1980, Seiko was seeking to
extend its right to sell watches in China. In return, he
says, the Chinese demanded some of his high-speed flash
converters, semiconductors that can switch rapidly between
analog and digital operations. Mr. Hall, who made six trips
to China between 1980 and 1984, says he dropped the project
after the Central Intelligence Agency warned him that the
converters could greatly improve the accuracy of China's
missiles.
   Seiko, in a written statement to this newspaper, says Mr.
Hall's account of the China matter is "totally wrong" and
"slander." It adds that when asked under oath about this as
part of the litigation, "Mr. Hall couldn't show any fact as
proof."
   Courtney Hart, a former Micro Power engineer, says he
hasn't any direct knowledge that the China project was
scrapped because the CIA intervened but confirms that the
agency tracked the company's dealings with China closely. A
CIA spokesman declines to comment.
   After Mr. Hall dropped the project, he says, his relations
with Mr. Hattori began to cool. That cast a pall over another
Hall objective: to sell Micro Power stock to the public to
raise the value of the shares and make the company more
independent. Mr. Hall contended in his lawsuit that the late
Seiko president induced him to produce more technology for
the Seiko group with false promises of support for a public
offering. Seiko denies the charge, saying it never tried to
block the offering.
   But in 1985, Mr. Hall, assuming that Seiko would go along,
contacted investment bankers about taking Micro Power public.
In addition, Arthur Trueger, who heads the San Francisco
branch of Berkeley Govett Ltd., a British investment firm,
injected $7 million into Micro Power by buying preferred
stock.
   Mr. Trueger turned out to be a demanding partner,
constantly sending deputies to monitor accounts and pushing
for a management shakeup. So, Micro Power's board hired
Michele Giammarino, a retired Texas Instruments Inc.
executive, to help Mr. Hall manage the company.
   Whether a public offering would have succeeded isn't
clear. Yasuo Sakaniwa, the former president of Seiko
Instruments' U.S. subsidiary, who is acting as a spokesman
for the Hattori family on the Hall matter, says he invited 10
investment banks to manage a stock offering. "They all told
me that Micro Power wasn't ready for it," he says.
   Yet a financial adviser retained by Micro Power who asked
not to be identified says three major Wall Street firms --
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities
Corp., and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. -- expressed
interest. Then, he says, "Giammarino came in, and suddenly
there was no deal."
   Clifford Gookin, who was then at Bear Stearns in San
Francisco, says his initial impression was that Micro Power
was in shape to go public. "Then I was told the owners had
changed their minds," he recalls. Wendy Lane, who worked on
Micro Power for Donaldson Lufkin, says she can't recall
whether the company was ready to go public. A Smith Barney
spokesman says the officials involved have left the firm and
can't be reached.
   To the board's dismay, Mr. Giammarino and Mr. Hall
squabbled from the start. The board first kicked Mr. Hall
upstairs to be chairman. Then, in June 1986, it charged that
Mr. Hall had "misappropriated" money and suspended him as
chairman. A month later, it fired him, although he retained
his stock. Despite losing both his job and his wife, he
received little consolation from industry colleagues.
   "We do a lot of business in Japan," admits the chairman of
a major semiconductor manufacturer. "It wouldn't be helpful
for us to get involved in this matter."
   Over two years, two judges and a court-sanctioned master
denied Seiko's request to dismiss most of Mr. Hall's
complaints. Another judge did dismiss much of Mr. Hall's suit
but left standing his claims of defamation and wrongful
termination. Meanwhile, Micro Power, in its countersuit in
the state court, accused him of stealing trade secrets -- a
charge that he denies. Micro Power also said he used company
funds to support his wife. He says the company permitted the
expenditures and deducted them from his salary.
   John Hadluck, Seiko's chief litigator in the case,
concedes that the court record reads a bit like "Rashomon,"
the film classic in which villagers and a samurai in old
Japan recount wildly differing versions of the same event.
Seiko tells a different tale from essentially the same set of
facts.
   Mr. Hadluck says one of Mr. Hall's main deficiencies was
his inability to produce consistent profits. "He would come
up with an occasional product which would produce a burst of
revenue, but that's not running a company," he says. "He just
loved to tinker with new ideas."
   Seiko contends that "poor management" justified the
1985-86 crackdown on Mr. Hall. But those were bad years for
the entire semiconductor industry: Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., a leading producer of analog devices, lost $8.9 million
in 1985 and $95.2 million in 1986. And Mr. Hall insists that
Micro Power did reasonably well under his leadership. He says
that its sales increased at an average of 25% a year to
nearly $30 million in 1986 and that it reported profits of up
to $1.6 million for eight consecutive years before he was
fired.
   Seiko also declines full responsibility for the actions of
Micro Power's board. At the time of Mr. Hall's ouster, Seiko
voted only 50% of the company's stock, although it was
supported by other shareholders, including Mr. Trueger.
   "I'm sorry for John," says Mr. Sakaniwa, the former Seiko
Instruments official and a close friend of both Mr. Hall and
the Hattori family. "Micro Power was his baby; so, I can
understand why he couldn't take it." Mr. Sakaniwa says he
respects Mr. Hall's "creative genius" but attributes much of
the trouble at Micro Power to what he sees as his lack of
"common sense or business sense." He denies there was any
Seiko conspiracy to oust Mr. Hall and prevent Micro Power
from going public. "I know deep in my heart that Seiko never
intended to deceive him," he says.
   Still being debated are whether Seiko transferred some of
his technology without the necessary license and whether that
data subsequently was reshipped to China, where it might have
wound up in the missile program. The Commerce Department's
initial investigation found nothing to substantiate that
complaint. Seiko says it did look over some of Micro Power's
data for manufacturing high-speed flash converters but didn't
find the information good enough to use. Seiko Instruments'
Mr. Enami says the company also was cleared of Mr. Hall's
charges by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
   But the Pentagon's technology-watchers believe that some
data transferred to Japan may have been of military
significance. And Mr. Hall says the Commerce Department's
investigators heard Seiko's side of the story but never
called him back. Rep. Helen Bentley, a Japan-bashing Maryland
Republican, has asked both the Commerce Department and the
U.S. Customs Service to reopen the investigation.
   Now, as Mr. Hall contemplates a disappointing settlement
of the dispute, his former wife is little better off. "It's a
very hard time for me. Seiko can't help me. John can't help
me," Ms. Endo says in a Tokyo telephone call. "I was very
miserable last year. I felt so sorry for John."
   Mr. Sakaniwa, the former Seiko executive, says this sad
dispute shows that "we have to be more careful about
personalities when we choose our partners." He adds: "In the
U.S. system, it is very easy to sue for trifling reasons."
   Oddly, Mr. Hall comes to much the same conclusion.
American entrepreneurs, he advises, should look beyond the
individuals with whom they strike agreements and consider
whom they might deal with in the future. "If Shoji were still
alive, this probably wouldn't have happened," he says,
invoking the name of Seiko's patriarch. "If Ichiro didn't
die, this case would've been settled long ago."
