   ATLANTA -- Recycling's popularity is soaring.
   Three out of four Americans believe they could more than
double the amount of waste they presently recycle, compared
with just 40% who thought so last July, according to a poll
released yesterday by the National Solid Wastes Management
Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group.

   Only 11% of the U.S.'s 160 million tons a year of
municipal solid waste is currently recycled, and even that
much is straining municipal officials, who must find somebody
to buy all those old newspapers, glass bottles, aluminum cans
and plastic containers.
   Nevertheless, 74% of those polled in March believe they
could beat the federal Environmental Protection Agency's
long-term goal of recycling 25% of the U.S.'s municipal solid
waste. And one in four said they could recycle as much as
three-fourths of everything they now throw out, compared with
just one in 10 who thought so last summer.
   To be sure, the public's sharply growing commitment to
recycling is already reflected in some states' recycling
goals. California and Iowa want to recycle 50% of their
garbage by the year 2000. New York wants to hit 50% by 1997,
Washington state by 1995 and Maine by 1994.
   But while there aren't yet enough new products and markets
to absorb the growing amount of recycled items being
collected by communities, experts attending the waste
association's annual convention here agreed that U.S.
manufacturers are going to be under increased public pressure
to use more recycled raw material in the goods they produce.
The industries most likely to be affected, the experts said,
are plastics, paper, glass, rubber, aluminum, metals and oil.
   The good news for manufacturers is that, "The public is
prepared to pay more" for those goods if they contain a lot
of recycled material, said Allen Moore, president of the
waste association.
   Newspaper and magazine publishers will be especially
affected, according to a study that was also released
yesterday by the association. The study found that while U.S.
newspapers contained only about 9% recycled fiber in 1988,
they will have 16% by 1992, 25% by 1995 and 40% by the year
2000 -- in part because of a proliferation of state
regulations requiring more recycled-fiber content in
newspapers.
   Moreover, the study noted that in order for publishers to
get the quality of newsprint they need, old magazine fiber
will have to be blended with old newspaper fiber, meaning
that, before long, Americans can expect to start putting
their magazines at the curb as well.
   The poll also found that public opposition to garbage
incinerators continues to lessen. Indeed, more than half of
those polled (55%) said they wouldn't object to an
incinerator being built in their community, compared with 44%
who didn't object last summer, and only 39% in February 1989.
   Even landfills got a bit more public support this time
around. Some 36% of those polled said they wouldn't object to
a new landfill in their community, compared with just 23% who
didn't object last summer and 30% in February 1989. A solid
59% majority, however, said they would still object, with
only 5% holding no opinion.
