   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Bank of New England-Old Colony N.A., a
unit of Bank of New England Corp., said it signed a consent
cease and desist order with the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency.
   The Bank of New England unit said the consent order deals
"comprehensively with the development and implementation of
plans, policies and procedures at the bank, and details
improvements to be made in the operations of the bank."

   The Bank of New England parent company signed a similar
consent order with the Federal Reserve, and two of its larger
units, Bank of New England N.A. and Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust
Co. N.A., have signed similar orders with the Comptroller.
   Two other banking units, Maine National Bank Corp. and
Bank of New England-West N.A., are expected to sign similar
orders with the Comptroller shortly, Bank of New England
said.
   The Old Colony unit said many of the requirements and
standards called for in the cease and desist order "are well
under way or have already been met."
