   NEW YORK -- Prime Motor Inns Inc., as expected, reported
that fiscal third-quarter profit plunged 98%, citing "intense
competition in the hotel industry."
   And Chairman Peter E. Simon said he expects Prime's
results to be "under pressure over the next several quarters"
-- a near-term outlook shared by "virtually every other"
hotel company.

   For the quarter ended March 31, Prime reported net income
of $209,000, or one cent a share, down from $18.2 million, or
55 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue dropped
17% to $82.4 million from $99.9 million. Last month, the
company had estimated that per-share net dropped
substantially for the quarter.
   Mr. Simon also said that Prime completed the sale of
long-term notes receivable to an affiliate of Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co. and received $40 million from the sale of a hotel.
Total proceeds of these transactions plus two previous debt
financings are $110 million, $57 million of which went to pay
bank debt and the rest for general purposes.
   Prime also said it will concentrate its resources on its
AmeriSuites all-suite properties and Wellesley Inn
limited-service hotels, operations where market demand has
been strong.
   The company thus reported no fees from contracting work it
does on properties, known as development income, nor any
gains on sales of properties. In the year-earlier period,
development income and property-sale gains were $13.6 million
and $6 million, respectively.
   Prime owns, operates or manages 139 hotels in the U.S.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Prime shares fell 12.5 cents to $7.875.
