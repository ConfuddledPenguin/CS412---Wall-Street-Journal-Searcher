   Schering AG said first-quarter net income rose 14% as
sales grew 4%.
   The German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group said net
was 125 million Deutsche marks ($74.2 million), up from 110
million marks a year earlier. In April, the company had
expressed some caution about its earnings and sales prospects
for 1990. Sales grew to 1.7 billion marks from 1.64 billion
marks.

   Schering said group sales grew strongest in West Germany,
where they were up 6.5% to 412 million marks as foreign sales
gained 3% to 1.289 billion marks.
   The company nonetheless was hurt by the negative impact of
the mark's strength. Price pressure in some markets also
damped earnings growth.
   Indeed, while many companies in the European chemicals
industry are seeing the physical volume of their products
sold rise, negative currency and price factors in competitive
markets have led to flat or downward trends in money terms.
   Schering noted that if not for the negative impact of
currency translations, group sales would have risen 9%. That
would indicate that the company's underlying sales growth
remains firm.
