   WASHINGTON -- President Bush all but named a new official
to lead the savings-and-loan bailout and insisted that the
administration is confronting the problem of the bailout's
rising cost.
   At a news conference, Mr. Bush said "we're very high on"
Federal Reserve official William Taylor, whom William
Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
enthusiastically recommended as his successor. Although Mr.
Taylor's name had circulated recently in connection with the
post, the president said Mr. Seidman's recommendation came to
him directly in a telephone call.

   Mr. Seidman has said since the S&amp;L industry bailout was
enacted in August that he wouldn't stay until the end of his
term in 1991. Privately, he says he expects to stay at least
through June 30 to direct an acceleration in the sales and
liquidations of insolvent thrifts expected by that time.
   Under last year's thrift-industry restructuring law, the
RTC has the lead role in managing the bailout, merging and
selling insolvent thrifts.
   Mr. Taylor, who is director of the Fed's division of
banking supervision and regulation, has been serving since
February as the temporary head of the RTC's policymaking
Oversight Board. Although Mr. Taylor agreed to serve as
interim president and chief executive officer of the board,
he didn't want that post permanently. Still, he has been
given credit for getting the thrift sales under way.
   A spokesman for Mr. Taylor declined to comment. The
nomination to head the RTC, which also would fill the job of
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., would
require Senate confirmation.
   Mr. Taylor, who shares the same sort of straight-talking,
no-nonsense style that won Mr. Seidman approval in Congress,
is widely respected in the banking field, but some lawmakers
were critical that the administration would allow Mr. Seidman
to leave without protest.
   "Bill Taylor is an able guy," said Rep. Bruce Vento (D.,
Minn.), who heads an RTC oversight task force, "but it
remains to be seen whether he'll assert the kind of
independence that gave Bill Seidman such a following."
   In his news conference, Mr. Bush denied that any friction
between himself and Mr. Seidman led to Mr. Seidman's plan to
leave his RTC post well before his term ends next year. Mr.
Seidman, who has long said he plans to depart early, has won
plaudits from Congress but has irritated administration
officials with his outspoken assertions that the bailout will
probably cost far more than the administration's early
estimates.
   Mr. Bush said: "I haven't told you I'm anxious to see Bill
Seidman leave." Noting his long relationship with Mr.
Seidman, who, like Mr. Bush, served in the Ford
administration, Mr. Bush added: "I think Seidman has
conducted himself with extraordinary grace and great
ability."
   Mr. Bush's aides have begun to acknowledge lately what Mr.
Seidman had long warned -- that the administration's official
estimate of the $166 billion over 10 years to pay for the
bailout is too low. Congress's General Accounting Office
recently estimated these costs would rise to at least $243
billion.
   The Bush administration has publicly acknowledged concern
over rising cost estimates, but hasn't described how it plans
to deal with the increased costs. Mr. Bush didn't offer any
new details, but promised: "We've got to work with the
Congress on how to deal with the cost, and right now there's
a significant review going forward to see what the costs are.
The figures change all the time on you."
   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee announced that Neil
Bush, the president's son, will be among those scheduled to
testify in Denver this month on the demise of Silverado
Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   Mr. Bush, who was on the board of Silverado, is to testify
along with other board members, S&amp;L regulators and Silverado
business associates.
   Other board members signed consent agreements recently,
barring them from participating in the thrift industry in the
future, over allegations of insider dealing at the Denver
thrift. Neil Bush, who asserts he did nothing illegal, has
refused to sign such an agreement. Thrift regulators are
pursuing the matter.
