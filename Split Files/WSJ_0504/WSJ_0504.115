to #164.1 million ($269.5 million) from #128.2 million, at
the top end of market expectations of #155 million to #165
million.

   But Wellcome dropped 21 pence to 655 pence on London's
Stock Exchange, as analysts said they were expecting a more
bullish report on the company's Retrovir drug, which is used
to fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Profit after tax and minority interests, or profit
attributable to shareholders, was #97.8 million, up from
#76.2 million. Per-share earnings increased to 11.5 pence
from nine pence.
   Wellcome declared an interim per-share dividend to 1.5
pence, up 15% from 1.3 pence.
   Sales rose 9% to #733.4 million from #672.7 million.
Excluding #92.9 million from its discontinued Coopers Animal
Health subsidiary, the group's latest sales figure improved
28%.
