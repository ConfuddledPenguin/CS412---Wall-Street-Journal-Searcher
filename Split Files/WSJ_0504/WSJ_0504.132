   NEW YORK -- A former public-finance executive with a
company now owned by Kemper Corp. won a $38.2 million
arbitration award in an employee-contract dispute.
   The award to Robert Kanuth by a three-member arbitration
panel of the National Association of Securities Dealers is
one of the largest such awards in the securities business,
attorneys said.

   The magnitude of the award -- which included $1 million
each for defamation and punitive damages -- stunned attorneys
for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc., the Kemper unit that lost
the case.
   "This will set the arbitration process back 50 years,"
said Edward Foote, a lawyer for Chicago-based Winston &amp;
Strawn, who represented Prescott. "It's an outrage -- the man
deserves nothing."
   Attorneys representing Prescott declined to say whether
the award will be appealed. But winning appeals in
arbitration cases is very difficult because the Federal
Arbitration Act provides a narrow window for reversing such
decisions.
   "Historically, there is a finality" to arbitration awards,
says Richard P. Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration
Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter. "The idea is that
an arbitration panel wouldn't be overturned unless you can
prove that in some way the arbitrators were manifestly
unjust."
   The case grew out of a dispute following the sale of Mr.
Kanuth's public financing underwriting business to Prescott
in September 1987. The contract provided for an upfront
payment of $11.3 million to Mr. Kanuth, in addition to a
series of payments over five years relating to the profit of
the company, which was to be run by Mr. Kanuth and
incorporated as a unit of Prescott.
   But after a series of disputes between Mr. Kanuth and
various Prescott executives, Mr. Kanuth filed a federal court
suit alleging breach of contract. He was fired shortly
thereafter.
   In turn, Prescott filed an arbitration case before the
NASD seeking damages for, among other things, alleged breach
of fiduciary duty by Mr. Kanuth in his role as an officer of
the Prescott public finance unit.
   The case, consolidated before the NASD panel, was complex:
Arbitrators heard testimony from 40 witnesses over 22 days of
hearings comprising nearly 7,000 pages of written transcript
and about 1,200 exhibits.
   The arbitration panel found that Prescott "acted
improperly" in dismissing Mr. Kanuth, noting that the
employment contract permitted dismissal only "upon very
limited circumstances." It thus awarded Mr. Kanuth salary
over five years and incentive compensation totaling more than
$33 million.
   Moreover, the panel found that Prescott -- in telling the
NASD that Mr. Kanuth was terminated for corporate waste and
mismanagement -- defamed Mr. Kanuth. It thus awarded him an
additional $1 million.
   Thomas Gottschalk, Mr. Kanuth's attorney at Kirkland &amp;
Ellis in Washington, said Prescott officials also "threatened
to suffocate" his client's business, and told him he would
"never earn a dime" if he pursued his claim.
   "The conduct of Prescott . . . was extreme and
outrageous," the panel's findings said, and caused Mr. Kanuth
emotional distress. The result: An additional $3 million
award, plus $1 million for punitive damages.
   The panel ordered Prescott to file within 30 days an
amended termination report with the NASD, reflecting that Mr.
Kanuth's termination resulted from a contractual dispute --
not from corporate waste or other mismanagement.
