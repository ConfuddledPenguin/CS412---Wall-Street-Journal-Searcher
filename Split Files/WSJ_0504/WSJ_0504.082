   THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT'S choice to head state-run
Korea Broadcasting System, Soh Ki Won, identified in an
earlier edition as a crony of former dictator Chun Doo Hwan,
served in the Chun government between 1980 and 1982. But the

the post was ceremonial and Mr. Soh had little influence. Mr.
Soh later worked with Seoul Shinmun newspaper.
