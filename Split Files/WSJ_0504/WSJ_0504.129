   BRUSSELS -- A new vision of European security is taking
shape, one that promises an altered -- and diminished -- role
for the U.S.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for 41 years the
spearhead of the West's fight against communism, will soon
find itself in victory smaller, weaker and battling for
political influence in the new Europe. Assuming current
political trends hold, most of the 305,000 American troops
that have stood guard here for decades will be going home.
What's more, the armed forces of the European NATO members
will shrink sharply as the Soviet Union pulls back its own
forces. As its military role recedes, NATO will scramble to
become more of a political body, seeking to settle regional
conflicts far from Europe and verifying arms control
treaties.

   And what's expected to crowd into NATO's domain? Two
forces: the increasingly unified 12-member European
Community, which wants to add security to its mandate, and
the separate Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, an existing 35-nation group that includes the U.S.
and the Soviet Union. Indeed, some European politicians are
calling for NATO to give way entirely to a new security
alliance based on the CSCE.
   Moves to pare NATO began in earnest on two continents
yesterday. In Washington, President Bush publicly conceded
that, because of political opposition in Europe and a
diminished threat from the East Bloc, the U.S. won't deploy a
new generation of nuclear weapons in Germany. And in
Brussels, Secretary of State James Baker, meeting with the 15
other NATO foreign ministers, kicked off an unprecedented
series of meetings which, over the next few months, will try
to salvage NATO's influence by cooking up new political
missions for the organization and deciding how to shrink its
military component in an orderly fashion.
   "NATO will remain vital to America's place in Europe," Mr.
Bush says. "It is a proven structure upon which to base our
security, and from which to promote a stable, cooperative
European order." But he called for a NATO summit meeting this
summer "to launch a wide-ranging NATO strategy review for the
transformed Europe of the 1990s."
   European officials reacted favorably to Mr. Bush's
announcement, especially the part about no new nuclear
weapons. Many European leaders, particularly those in West
Germany, would have faced serious political trouble trying to
sell a new arsenal to their publics. NATO Secretary-General
Manfred Woerner said the U.S. proposals received "very strong
and broad support."
   Clearly, NATO is unlikely to disappear completely. Many
Europeans want a continuing link to the U.S., and the U.S. is
warning privately it won't help defend Europe without NATO.
Most important, NATO is widely seen as the only force able to
counter both resurgent German nationalism and a Soviet Union
that will remain Europe's major military power -- an unstable
giant bristling with nuclear weapons and millions of troops a
train ride from Western Europe.
   "NATO will remain an essential element of security for the
West and possibly for a larger number of countries," says
Italian foreign minister Gianni De Michelis. But he adds,
"This must be seen as a transition period for the alliance,
an evolution from the military to a political viewpoint."
Says NATO's Mr. Woerner: "The alliance must "move beyond
confrontation to cooperation."
   Europe is more ambivalent about the American presence here
than at any time since World War II. It is both more willing
and more able to pay for and manage its own defense. With a
united Germany at its heart, Europe will naturally shift its
political attention to European-dominated institutions. The
EC recently took a significant step by endorsing a French and
German initiative that could lead to joint decision-making on
political and defense matters within three years, and could
even lead to a pan-European Army of sorts in the next
century. Both France and West Germany back a greater role for
the CSCE, as a way to include both the new democracies of
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in European political
matters.
   The U.S. strategy, by contrast, is to endorse the European
Community and CSCE security roles generally, but work to
limit them in practice to relatively marginal matters -- such
as mediating disputes within Europe -- that will leave NATO
with the broader role.
   "It's our hope and belief that these institutions can act
in a complementary but not a competitive way," says Mr.
Baker.
   But sorting all this out won't be easy. One thing that's
certain is that the new Europe will have far fewer soldiers
and far fewer nuclear warheads on its soil. With Soviet
troops gradually returning home from East Germany, Hungary,
Poland and Czechoslovakia over the next five years, the U.S.
military presence will drop to perhaps 50,000 troops. Those
Americans who remain will likely find themselves working
closely with French, British and Italian soldiers, perhaps
even in internationally mixed regiments, which don't exist in
NATO today. NATO's supreme commander -- until now an American
-- will probably be a European. East and West German armies
will be combined into a force that could be limited to as few
as 200,000 men in total, a cut of more than 50% from the
500,000 soldiers in the current German armies.
   Mr. Bush's decision yesterday not to replace the Lance
missile is part of a package that will eventually eliminate
the 88 launchers and 700 nuclear warheads already in Germany.
Similarly, the decision not to deploy improved nuclear
artillery shells is part of a broader plan to scrap those in
Europe now. France will almost certainly abandon its
short-range Hades missile, leaving only British and French
long-range missiles in Western Europe -- buttressed by the
threat of American nuclear weapons fired from U.S. territory
or carried on airplanes and submarines. German officials of
all parties say privately that it will be much easier to gain
public acceptance of airborne nuclear weapons based in
Germany, rather than ground-based ones.
   Any breakup of the Soviet Union or violent domestic unrest
there could, of course, give NATO a fresh lease on life.
Neither the U.S. nor its European allies will make major
political concessions or embark on a new security structure
until the Soviet Union's future becomes clearer.
   Assuming there is no cataclysmic event in the Soviet
Union, the move to a new European security structure will
have to consider a dizzying array of national agendas on a
continent that, prior to NATO's reign, exploded into war
twice in this century. France, which withdrew its army from
NATO's control in 1966, will spend the 1990s trying to
bolster the European Community as a sort of board of
directors for all European matters -- including security.
That approach would maximize Paris's influence and confine
both the U.S. and the Soviet Union to ancillary institutions
-- NATO or the CSCE.
   "We all have to get rid of our old ideas about NATO," says
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. "In the new
political climate France and Germany must move ever closer.
There will certainly be more cooperation on the production
and procurements of arms. Europe will be more European, but
we must keep a sort of U.S. presence that's less military and
more politically intense." That's a touchy issue: Both
Britain and Germany have recently asked France to help cement
a U.S. role by rejoining NATO's integrated military command;
Paris politely declined.
   Europe's growing political clout is already evident. Last
month, French President Francois Mitterrand and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued a joint letter to Lithuanian
President Vytautas Landsbergis urging him to suspend the
republic's declaration of independence, and thereby avoid
destabilizing Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr.
Landsbergis responded favorably.
   For its part, Germany needs some kind of communal security
grouping as a sort of parole organization to reassure the
victims of its earlier invasions. "There's an important case
for Germany staying in an alliance so it's not perceived by
its neighbors as being a rogue elephant," says John Roper,
head of the new Institute for European Security Studies in
Paris. Many German politicians, including Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Socialist Party leaders, are more
attracted to the idea of an all-European security system in
the CSCE that could eventually replace NATO. They like the
thought of having Moscow inside the security system along
with the U.S., something only the CSCE permits.
   The emerging Warsaw Pact nations, led by Czechoslovakia's
charismatic President Vaclav Havel, also would like to dump
NATO in the long run. To them, it represents the bad old days
of the cold war and they believe Moscow would try hard to
keep them from joining the old alliance even if it invited
them in. So the East Europeans will be pressing in a few
years for a new CSCE structure with such features as a
peacekeeping force.
   Moscow, in turn, with only the dead Warsaw Pact to rely
on, has latched onto the idea of a strong CSCE. Its goal is
to replace NATO and the Warsaw Pact with a grouping in which
the Soviet Union would be a player and Germany could be
constrained. Indeed, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze is likely to insist this weekend at German
unification talks that steps toward German unity be
"synchronized" with the development of such a structure. The
West rejects that stand.
   The U.S., having "won" the cold war, is determined to
retain its influence in Europe even as its troops go home. To
do that, it must maintain the primacy of the only European
organization which is both controlled by Washington and
off-limits to Moscow: NATO. But until this week's
initiatives, Washington seemed slow to react to the quick
pace of change in Europe. The White House and State
Department had brushed off the talk of competing security
systems, and failed to make a persuasive case in Brussels for
NATO's new role.
   But yesterday, Mr. Baker formally endorsed the idea of
using the CSCE to resolve intra-European disputes and said
"we don't see a major problem with the fact that the EC would
be talking about some sort of security discussion or
component." He will be using a series of future NATO meetings
to try to cut deals reserving the most important security
decisions for NATO.
   In the end, NATO will have to find a way to live with the
competing groupings and coordinate its policies with them.
Some suggest that NATO might become a subgroup of the larger
CSCE. Others see the European Community as a bridge between
the two.
   Mulling this over after yesterday's NATO meeting, Italy's
Mr. Michelis suggested a smaller NATO might form the center
of a series of "concentric circles" of security encompassing
select countries. "Everything must be connected," he said.
