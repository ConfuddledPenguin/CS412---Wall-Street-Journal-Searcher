   Lillian Vernon Corp. said its fiscal fourth-quarter net
income climbed 23% to $3.1 million from a year earlier,
reflecting improved operating efficiency and sales from a new
catalog.
   The specialty catalog retailer's net income in the quarter
ended Feb. 24 rose to $3.1 million, or 50 cents a share, from
$2.5 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 9.8% to $42.3 million from $38.5 million.

   The earnings advance reflects, in part, better inventory
management, said Lillian Vernon, chief executive officer of
the Mount Vernon, N.Y.-based company.
   Sales also benefited from the introduction of the firm's
new At Home catalog, featuring upscale decorative home
accessories. Introduced in July 1989, that catalog was mailed
to 3.5 million homes. Lillian Vernon's core catalogs offer
primarily inexpensively priced gifts and housewares.
   Lillian Vernon shares closed yesterday in composite
trading on the American Stock Exchange at $23, up 87.5 cents.
   Fiscal 1990 net rose 33% to $10.8 million, or $1.75 a
share, from $8.1 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 10% to $154.7 million from $140.6 million.
