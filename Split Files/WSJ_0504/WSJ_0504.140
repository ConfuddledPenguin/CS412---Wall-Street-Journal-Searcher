   WASHINGTON -- Initial claims for state unemployment
insurance rose 24,000 in the week ended April 21 to a
seasonally adjusted 372,000 from an unrevised 348,000 the
previous week, the Labor Department said.
   In the week ended April 14, 2,474,000 persons were
receiving state unemployment benefits, up 172,000 from the
previous week's unrevised 2,302,000. The number of persons
receiving unemployment benefits as a percentage of those
covered by unemployment insurance rose to 2.4% in the week
ended April 14 from 2.2% the week before.

   The week ended April 21 followed the reporting period that
included the Good Friday holiday, in which there were fewer
days to file jobless claims. Initial claims for state
unemployment insurance typically rise in weeks that follow
major holidays.
