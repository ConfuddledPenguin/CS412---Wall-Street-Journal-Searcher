   About 11,000 Machinists at McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s
jet-fighter factory in St. Louis will vote this weekend on a
three-year contract proposal that union leaders have called
"woefully inadequate."
   The union bargaining committee has called on the rank and
file to reject the offer, and it's expected they will do so.
The membership already has authorized a strike, though any
stoppage wouldn't begin for seven days, giving the company
more time to offer another package. The current contract
expires at midnight Sunday.

   The proposal, according to the Machinists, calls for a
5.5% wage increase in the first year of the accord, and 3%
gains in both the second and third years. In addition,
one-time lump-sum bonuses of 4% would be handed out all three
years.
   On their face, those terms match what the Machinists at
McDonnell Douglas's transport aircraft subsidiary in Long
Beach, Calif., approved late last year. They are less
generous than what ultimately was settled upon at Boeing Co.
after a 48-day strike by the Machinists last fall. And they
are more bountiful than what was reluctantly agreed upon in
March by 18,000 Lockheed Corp. union members at three sites.
   McDonnell Douglas, like Lockheed, must contend with a
slumping military market. Like Boeing, which is highly
profitable, it also has commercial aircraft programs; but
McDonnell Douglas's jetliner operations have been losing lots
of money because of production glitches.
   Cassell Williams, president of Machinists District Lodge
837, said in an interview that the union and company were
still far apart on several key points. He said the basic
economic provisions would be adequate for his members, who
currently make $14.90 an hour on average. But, he said, the
company's plan wouldn't allow workers at the low end of the
wage scale to fold any cost-of-living adjustments into their
salary calculations. That means that any future wage
increases would be figured from a lower base.
   Mr. Williams said that even at McDonnell Douglas's
troubled commercial unit, all of the Machinists got to fold
their COLAs into the contract they ratified.
   A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas declined to comment on
the specifics of the pact. But he said the company was
"disappointed that the offer was rejected" by the bargaining
committee "especially in light of uncertainties around
defense spending."
   Given such a shaky environment, another issue that the
union still hopes to address is job security.
   Meanwhile, the Machinists at Lockheed Corp.'s aircraft
service unit in Ontario, Calif., which repairs and retrofits
Navy and Air Force planes, continue to walk the picket lines.
Their strike started March 11 after rejecting a three-year
contract offer that was deemed too skimpy.
   "We're still apart on the essentials," Bob Gregory, the
union's top negotiator, said. A company spokesman said
despite the labor disruption, Lockheed has managed to get
every plane delivered on schedule by using supervisors.
