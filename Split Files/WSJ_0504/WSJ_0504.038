   New York -- The stage murder mystery isn't what it used to
be. No doubt that reflects the times we live in, but whatever
the cause, writers no longer feel they can offer a
straightforward version of the form.
   As in plays like "Sleuth" or "Deathtrap," there has to be
a gimmick, a revelation part way through the play that lets
us know the author is standing behind the scenes pulling the
strings. "This is all a joke," they seem to be saying, not a
real murder or a real mystery.

   The latest entry in the field is "Accomplice" by Rupert
Holmes at the renamed Richard Rodgers Theater, formerly the
46th Street Theater. In this case there isn't just one level
of deception but a play within a play within a play. And in
the final scene the author himself, going his predecessors
one better, comes on stage to take part in the action.
   There is no danger that I will give away the plot because
it is much too complicated to remember. Initially the action
is set in an English country cottage, cleverly designed by
David Jenkins to include stone walls and a large mill wheel
inside the house that serves both as a wine cellar and, late
in the play, as an instrument of torture.
   The evening's fun and games begins before the curtain goes
up when we are told that the leading male role will be played
by the understudy -- an announcement that seems odd on an
opening night. But then, looking at the program, one
discovers that there are three male understudies listed for
two actual performers.
   The first scene, seemingly the murder of a husband by his
wife, is really a rehearsal of the murder by the woman and
her lover. When the presumed murder takes place, after
innumerable delays that the audience is supposed to recognize
as typical of the genre, it turns out not to be for the
original motive at all. The wife is killing her husband not
to be with her male lover, but with his wife. Mind you, this
is all in the first act. From there things become
increasingly convoluted.
   The four actors, each called on to play a variety of roles
and each performing with considerable brio, are Michael
McKean, Natalia Nogulich, Jason Alexander and Pamela Brull.
Author Holmes is a clever man with a quip, and he knows the
form inside out, which allows him to parody it on many
levels. The question becomes, what is one's tolerance for
unending zigzags, reversals and divagations? It's as if that
mill wheel on stage were turning all evening and each
rotation produced a new layer of deception.
   The best answer, I think, is to go expecting a diversion.
For those who love fun and games at the expense of a
well-known literary form, "Accomplice" affords an
entertaining evening. Those whose threshold for this kind of
theatrical gimcrack is somewhat lower may not be that amused.

   "Truly Blessed" at the Longacre Theater cannot be judged
on the same basis as an ordinary Broadway show for the simple
reason that it is in reality a Gospel concert. But it does
have a basis in play-acting: Queen Esther Marrow, a dignified
performer with a strong, resonant voice, takes the part of
the late great gospel diva Mahalia Jackson. In most cases the
facts of Ms. Jackson's life are enacted or, at least,
narrated. Ms. Marrow comes down stage to describe Ms.
Jackson's journey from the South, to churches in the North,
to world renown as a gospel performer. Along the way we learn
of her involvement with the civil rights movement and of
mountain-top moments such as an appearance at Carnegie Hall.
   Ms. Marrow is assisted by four enthusiastic, talented
singers -- Carl Hall, Lynette G. DuPre, Doug Eskew and Gwen
Stewart -- and four instrumentalists. They perform a number
of familiar gospel songs with additional ones written by Ms.
Marrow. During the static narrative sections the show often
stops in its tracks. But in the musical numbers, especially
on those occasions when the performers ask the audience to
join them in clapping hands, "Truly Blessed" becomes a
celebratory event for all concerned.

   In the late spring, just before the deadline for annual
Tony nominations, we can normally expect to see a little of
everything opening on Broadway, and this year has been no
exception. The wildest of the wild cards, however, has to be
"A Change in the Heir," a medieval musical fairy tale at the
Edison Theater. Originating in Chicago, this is a sophomoric
piece, by which I hasten to add, high school sophomoric, not
college.
   The action takes place during the Dark Ages, which is
symbolic on more levels than one. Two children, who will one
day vie to be heirs to the throne of a kingdom, are
arbitrarily assigned to the opposite sex at birth: The girl
is called Conrad and the boy Agnes. Don't ask the reason for
this. It's too Byzantine to explain. Among the innumerable
improbable events of the play, we are asked to believe that
these two don't discover their true sexual identities until
the eve of their 20th birthdays, when Agnes looks at
pornographic pictures and Conrad swims nude in the moat
around the castle.
   The performers work hard, especially Judy Blazer as Conrad
and Jeffrey Herbst as Agnes, but they, like all the other
actors, are swimming round and round in a moat of ineptitude
and implausibility with no hope of escape.
