   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department announced that it
will file a civil antitrust suit against American
Multi-Cinema Inc. and Mid-America Cinema Corp., two Kansas
City-area film exhibitors.
   The two companies entered into a management agreement in
December 1988 in which AMC, which is a unit of Kansas City,
Mo.-based AMC Entertainment, obtained power to set admission
prices and film rental fees for MAC's theaters in the Kansas
City metropolitan area, according to a Justice Department
statement. The statement also said that the two companies
have a combined market share that exceeded 65% of all
first-run admissions in 1989, and that this poses a
significant risk to competition in the Kansas City area, in
both Missouri and Kansas.
