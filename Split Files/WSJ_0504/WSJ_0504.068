   New Jersey employers are scrambling to figure out how to
comply with a new state law requiring them to give time off
to employees with pressing family needs.
   The Family Leave Act, which goes into effect today, sets
the most generous leave policies in the nation and is a model
for similar initiatives being considered in other states.
Advocates say it is in the forefront of "family friendly"
labor laws intended to attract and retain employees,
particularly women.

   "American businesses need to recognize that workers have
both work responsibilities and family responsibilities, and
they need some accommodation of these competing needs," says
Helen Norton, staff attorney for the Women's Legal Defense
Fund in Washington, D.C.
   But many New Jersey employers view the new law with
concern and confusion. "It's going to be very difficult for
employers, particularly in smaller companies where every
employee is key," says James Morford, vice president of the
New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. In applying the law to
companies of different sizes, he notes, "there's no
flexibility."
   In its first year, the law requires companies with over
100 employees to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave with
benefits every two years to employees facing the birth or
adoption of a child or a serious illness in their immediate
family. Upon returning, employees must be given the same or
an equal job at the same pay.
   Next year, the law will be extended to companies with more
than 75 employees and, the year after that, to companies with
50 or more employees. At that time, the law will affect
roughly 10,000 companies in New Jersey and about half the
state's employees. Employers who fail to comply can be fined
up to $5,000 per violation and be sued for punitive damages.
   The law is part of a legislative trend in many states --
as well as recent efforts in Congress -- toward mandating a
new balance between the workplace and employees' families.
Since 1972, 25 states and Puerto Rico passed laws that in
some form protect employees who must leave their jobs
temporarily for family reasons.
   Another 14 states have legislation pending. Most are
variations of New Jersey's law, but some go further.
Lawmakers in Pennsylvania are considering a measure that
would require companies with only 10 employees to provide up
to 18 weeks of unpaid family leave and 26 weeks of unpaid
medical leave, with job-back guarantees. In Massachusetts,
state legislators are considering similar leave provisions
requiring employers to offer them with pay.
   But New Jersey's law is the broadest. Most such laws
address only maternity leave. The concept of family leave --
applying both to time off due to babies and seriously ill
family members -- is still foreign to many employers. And in
almost every state where leave benefits are mandatory,
employees must assume the cost of company benefits, such as
health insurance premiums, while on leave.
   New Jersey is the only state that both mandates generous
leave provisions and requires companies to pay for benefits
while the employee is out. That worries many employers,
business groups and labor management lawyers.
   "This totally ignores the realities of business," says
Marvin Goldstein, an attorney with the Roseland, N.J., labor
law firm of Grotta, Glassman &amp; Hoffman, which represents
management.
   Proponents say such laws are long overdue. More than half
of new mothers -- married women with children under a year
old -- have jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Traditional households with a working husband and
a wife at home are at an all-time low -- 5% of all married
couples. Laws such as New Jersey's, proponents say, are
necessary as more women build careers and as fathers assume
more responsibility for child rearing. The laws also
recognize that, with the population growing older and both
spouses working, employees increasingly need time off to care
for aging relatives.
   Companies complain that New Jersey's law is going into
effect without regulations defining its scope. It isn't
clear, for example, whether an employee is only someone
working in the state or is anyone employed by a New
Jersey-based company, even those working outside the state.
   Employers also say that exemptions from the law are
unclear and there is potential for abuse by employees. "There
are a lot of people out there who wouldn't mind taking 12
weeks off, particularly with benefits and job reinstatement,"
says Steven W. Suflas, a labor attorney at Archer &amp; Greiner,
a Haddonfield, N.J., law firm.
   The civil rights division of the state Attorney General's
office is expected to issue a legal opinion today answering
some of these questions, and regulatory guidelines will
follow this summer.
   Many employers say that state laws governing employee
benefits are anti-competitive, expensive and disruptive,
particularly for companies in highly specialized fields.
"Employers need flexibility to structure a mix of wages,
salaries and benefits in order to keep good workers," says
Ann Hurwitt, incoming president of the New Jersey Association
of Women Business Owners, which opposes the law. "Mandated
benefits ignore the diverse needs of employees and limit the
options available in employment negotiations."
   Unpaid leave could create special problems for small
companies in New Jersey and other states that follow its
lead, says Carolyn Miller, a lobbyist for the National
Federation of Independent Business in Washington, D.C. The
federation, which represents small businesses and claims
570,000 members nationwide, including 5,000 in New Jersey,
has mounted intense lobbying efforts against family-leave
legislation. For smaller companies, particularly if the work
involved is highly skilled, the ill-timed absence of one or
two employees can be critical, says Ms. Miller.
   At United Medical Corp., which specializes in providing
24-hour electrocardiogram analysis and heart pacemaker
monitoring, job training alone takes four to six weeks, says
Marian Wissman, the company's personnel director. The
Haddonfield, N.J., company has 500 employees, including 170
in New Jersey. "People don't just walk into this job," she
says.
   Some large companies in New Jersey, such as Johnson &amp;
Johnson in New Brunswick and Campbell Soup Co. in Camden,
already offer leave benefits that equal or surpass the new
state requirements. But many companies, employers say, may
have to scale back on other benefits in order to meet the
costs of complying with the law. Some employers also predict
a new reluctance to hire and promote employees, particularly
women, who they think may be more likely to need leaves.
   "Employers will have to make these calls," says Mr.
Morford of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. "It adds
another foggy dimension to hiring and promotion practices."
