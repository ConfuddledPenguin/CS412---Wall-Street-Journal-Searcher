   U.K. financial services group British &amp; Commonwealth
Holdings PLC said it is seeking buyers for its core merchant
banking and related financial services operations.
   The concern disclosed last month that massive losses at
its Atlantic Computers unit would require it to begin
disposing of assets in a bid to reduce group indebtedness and
stay in operation. The company said S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., the
British merchant bank, has been hired to find buyers.

   The company said a number of potential purchasers have
already expressed interest.
   Officials declined to say how much they expected to
generate from the sales, or when deals would be completed.
