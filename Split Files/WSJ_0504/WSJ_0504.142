   THE U.S. IS SCRAPPING plans to place new short-range
missiles in Europe.
   Citing recent political changes in Eastern Europe, Bush
announced that the U.S. was dropping plans for a modernized
version of the existing Lance missile because "there is less
need for nuclear systems of the shortest range." The missiles
were to be based in West Germany. The president, speaking at
the White House, also declared that the U.S. won't put new
nuclear artillery shells into Western Europe, and said the
administration is prepared to open talks with the Soviet
Union more quickly than previously planned on cutting
existing short-range nuclear missiles.

   Lithuania's premier urged Bush to formally recognize the
Baltic republic's independence from Moscow. But following an
Oval Office meeting, Kazimiera Prunskiene expressed doubt
about what position the president would take. The White House
issued a statement expressing support for the republic's
"self-determination."

People's Front said it could muster the two-thirds majority
needed. In Armenia, legislators voted to suspend the draft of
young men into the Soviet armed forces.

   Bush said the U.S. will try to discover the fate of four
Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982. The president,
speaking in Washington, expressed hope that the offer will
satisfy Tehran's call for a U.S. gesture of thanks for its
help in winning the release in Beirut of two U.S. hostages.
Six Americans remain missing in Lebanon.
                                                                                                       

   Iran's President Rafsanjani branded the Bush
administration a "stubborn, frustrated child," and he said
