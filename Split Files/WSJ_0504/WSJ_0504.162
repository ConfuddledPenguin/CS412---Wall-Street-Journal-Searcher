   Your March 22 page-one article about banks getting tough
with their small-business customers is ironic ("Credit
Crunch: As Banks Get Tough With Borrowers, Fears of a
Recession Rise").
   Now that the highfliers have gone bad, the banks clamp
down on the little guy -- the solid citizens of American
Business.

   Is the small-business man the "bread and butter" of the
banks? Only when it comes to deposits and monthly bank
charges. Perhaps small-business men should consider imitating
the highfliers of land development. Free gold at a new
resort? Free membership at our health spa?
   I think the next time any small-business man makes a
banking decision, he had best ask the bank for the same
information it wants from him. How good is your collateral,
Mr. Banker? Would you give me a personal guarantee on any
losses in my account, Mr. Banker? Deposits are a loan. Let
the lender beware.

   The current credit crunch illustrates a fact that neither
lenders nor borrowers like to admit: The longer you are with
a lender, the more vulnerable you are to having your credit
terminated.
   That's because eventually every lender's credit policy
will change, and any tightening always hurts small and
midsize companies the most. Meanwhile, you've lost touch with
other lenders and let your loan-presentation skills become
rusty.
   We urge middle-market companies to maintain contact with
several lenders -- do business with more than one, if
possible. And just because you've been with the same lender
for 10 or 20 years, don't think you're secure.
