   So the long-winded chief executive at this year's annual
meeting put you to sleep? You're lucky. For him, that speech
may have been sheer torture.
   In this garrulous, smooth-talking world, many executives
and professionals are afflicted with what specialists call
presentation phobia, or stage fright. A far cry from
butterflies in the stomach, it's sometimes severe enough to
slow careers to a stop.

   The fear can strike not only the chief executive facing a
hall of shareholders but also the manager asked to "say
something about yourself" at a staff meeting. Most are closet
sufferers who take great pains to hide their problem, and
often succeed.
   But as treatment becomes more effective and widely
available, more people are getting help. Clinics that sprang
up in the past decade to treat agoraphobia (fear of being in
open or public places) and other anxieties have refined the
diagnosis and treatment of public-speaking problems.
Companies now hire consultants to conduct speech training for
their managers, from the merely apprehensive to the secretly
petrified.
   "Of the full range of anxiety disorders," says Charles
Melville, an Atlanta psychiatrist, "people can most
predictably overcome a fear of public speaking."
   Training or treatment can range from practical tips --
speak and breathe slowly -- to medication. But it isn't
cheap: Consultants may charge close to $1,000 a person for
group counseling, and more for private assistance.
   There's a big audience. Speech phobia, the most disabling
version of these fears, affects up to 2% of Americans,
according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Bert
Decker of Decker Communications, a San Francisco consulting
firm, estimates that "roughly half the business" population
labors under milder forms of the anxiety and tries to avoid
speaking in public.
   But unlike people terrified of, say, flying or insects who
can often dodge the problem, many business people reach a
point where they can no longer run from the podium. "I can't
tell you how many executives have called and said they {had
to have help or} would have to give up their career," says
Roger Callahan, a therapist in Indian Wells, Calif.
   Miles Collier, managing partner of Collier Enterprises in
Naples, Fla., says he always kept his head down in school. "I
always worked on the theory, `Don't ask a question, or
volunteer, and you can still get A's.'" But his shaking knees
and churning stomach were real obstacles when his development
firm became tangled in local environmental conflicts. Four
years after Mr. Decker began teaching him to pace and hold
himself differently, Mr. Collier considers speaking to an
audience of 100 "a piece of cake" and appearing on television
bearable.
   Public-speaking fears can start any time -- when a child
is humiliated reciting in class, for example, or when a
critical presentation is the last straw for an executive
already under high stress. When the panic hits, the nervous
system unleashes a flood of chemicals in the adrenaline
family, creating an acute "fight or flight" state, just as if
the speaker were about to be mugged or run over.
   The person's thoughts become gripped by fears that others
will see the panic, making an impostor of the "competent,
capable professional," says Dr. Melville. Whether the speaker
stumbles off the dais, or -- much more common -- keeps his
fears masked, even one episode reinforces the anxiety -- and
likelihood -- that it will recur.
   As a result, executives often avoid any opportunities to
speak, even pushing others into the limelight instead.
Conversely, some appear to be the "eager beaver," says Tom
Harrison, a therapist at the Phobia Center of the Southwest
in Dallas, always jumping in first to get beyond the dreaded
event.
   Most treatment tries to short-circuit the cycle, first by
cutting through the stigma attached to such fears. Many
people feel more shame about the condition than if they "had
just killed a family member and buried them," says Burt
Rubin, a lawyer who has fought the phobia himself and runs
eight courses a year at Roundhouse Psychiatric Center in
Alexandria, Va. An attorney in his group remembers that "it
was helpful from the minute I walked in there and looked at
the other seven people {and thought}, `They look normal.'"
   Counselors try to make people realize that, despite their
symptoms, they, too, appear quite normal when speaking. As
Mr. Rubin repeats constantly: "Nobody else is hooked up to
the inside of your nervous system." A vital tool is the
videotape. Michele Felde, a marketing manager at Ingres
Corp., an Alameda, Calif., software firm, found it a
comforting surprise to watch herself on tape in a Decker
class. "I may feel nervous," she says, "but I don't look like
a bumbling fool; I'm not sweating up a storm" on tape.
   It takes repeated practice and feedback to make the
message stick. A college administrator in Mr. Rubin's group
tells of great anxiety over an impromptu presentation before
visiting dignitaries. Her talk, she says sheepishly, "wasn't
the most coherent {or} logical." Mr. Rubin immediately, but
gently, chastises her: "We can be sure that you were very
coherent and lucid, as you always are here."
   Indeed, the paradox is that those who suffer most usually
have the least to fear. They are successful for the same
reason they are anxious: fierce perfectionism. Mr. Harrison
tells clients, "The reality is, you wouldn't have this
problem if you'd just screw up more."
   Gina White, media relations coordinator for the National
Mental Health Association, says the most important thing she
learned in Mr. Rubin's group was "right before you get up {to
speak}, to mentally forgive yourself if you blow it. The
degree to which you don't forgive yourself is the degree to
which you {become anxious}."
   Such simple techniques can prove very powerful. One goal
is to get people to pull away from the emotions and symptoms
that flood them by focusing on the immediate moment. Mr.
Rubin, for example, coaches clients to concentrate on
fingering the wood grain of a lectern.
   Mr. Decker stresses the fundamentals of presentation: body
language, expression, putting a real smile on your face.
"Change the behavior," he says, "and the confidence will
follow." Still, some techniques are similar. Ms. Felde says
she was helped most in her Decker class by learning "the
pause": that "it's OK to take five to eight seconds to just
breathe and rest." Not everyone, she realized, is thinking,
"Oh, she forgot what she was going to say."
   Going to a group like Toastmasters, where people polish
their skills by speaking to each other, may be a lot cheaper.
Decker Communications charges $975 a person for a two-day
corporate course, and $3,500 for a day alone with Mr. Decker.
Mr. Rubin charges $750 a person for a 12-week course, or $85
for a private hour. But, while many counselors suggest going
to Toastmasters to practice good habits, most believe people
first need specialized techniques and support.
   Some therapists also use Inderal or other "beta blockers,"
which counter the flow of chemicals, allowing a client to get
through a "must" talk or work on techniques without being
overwhelmed physically. But others warn that the drugs can
create dependency, reinforcing people's fears that they can't
function.
   Whatever the treatment, anxieties rarely evaporate
completely. Even success stories, however, often remain as
hidden as the anxiety itself. "Clients don't want to think
their attorney has any doubts," says one prominent
Washington, D.C., lawyer, explaining why she won't give her
name despite her triumph over the problem. "There'd be utter
disbelief from the people who know me."
