   An exodus of key staff members at the Securities and
Exchange Commission is leaving the agency without experienced
senior managers in many of its most important posts.
   Some argue that the turnover at the SEC was long overdue,
and that the agency has held together its senior staff for a
long time. And some of the most visible staffers, including
the heads of market regulation, corporation finance and
investment management, are staying put for now.

   But the bailout pace is quickening. Chairman Richard
Breeden's right-hand woman, Linda Fienberg, recently quit,
apparently after being told she wouldn't get the coveted
general counsel's job that Daniel Goelzer is expected to
leave soon. (Ms. Fienberg, who is out of the country,
couldn't be reached for comment.) The top personnel slot,
vacant since September, remains open, as does the post of
executive director.
   Mr. Breeden has moved to shore up staffing by hiring an
old friend, James Doty, as senior special counsel. Mr. Doty
is expected to become general counsel. Mr. Breeden also
promoted Marianne Smythe to Ms. Fienberg's old job as
executive assistant to the chairman.
   Possibly the most visible loss is Nina Gross, who as the
SEC's legislative affairs director was its day-to-day link
with Congress. Well-considered among legislators and Capitol
Hill staffers, Ms. Gross helped shepherd a number of
SEC-backed initiatives. Mitchell Delk, a veteran of Wall
Street and Capitol Hill, takes the job.
   Another notable departee is John Sturc, the tough cop who
as associate enforcement director brought the SEC's cases
against Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   Other top aides are expected to leave shortly. Kathryn
McGrath, the head of investment management, will likely call
it quits within a few months, insiders say. Ms. McGrath, head
of the division for nearly seven years and a 16-year agency
veteran, has been a tough campaigner for increased
mutual-fund disclosure. The fund industry, which has fought
her at almost every turn, isn't likely to be unhappy if she
does depart. She wouldn't comment.

   A CONGRESSIONAL BOMBSHELL on alleged market
"front-running" fizzles after members of a House subcommittee
press a witness.
   James Coxon, head of Cigna Corp.'s investment policy
committee, stunned the telecommunications and finance
subcommittee yesterday by testifying that a "club" of Wall
Street firms "share proprietary customer information" to help
them do program trades ahead of large customer orders. Mr.
Coxon, a veteran of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and of Harvard
Management Co., which manages Harvard University's $5 billion
endowment, said he sold stock-index futures ahead of the 1987
market crash because of information received from the Wall
Street firms.
   "We knew what formulas were inside the `black boxes' "
that firms used to determine when to set off computer-driven
program trades, Mr. Coxon said. That information was
routinely shared in phone conversations among firms, he said.
   That antagonized Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y.), who
dismissively said, "When someone talks about secret cabals
and clubs, I just figure it's just another wacko in the
room."
   When pressed on how much of the alleged manipulation is
going on, Mr. Coxon explained that what he was describing
wasn't new. He added that he already had described the
process in detail to the Brady Task Force, which studied the
1987 crash, and was simply expounding on what other witnesses
had said last year. Moreover, he was focusing solely on
portfolio insurance, a form of program trading that reports
show helped accelerate the 1987 crash but that is now little
used on Wall Street. He also was unable to offer any proof
that manipulative information-sharing actually occurred. The
other witnesses at the hearing, including Brady panel veteran
Peter Borish, head of research at Tudor Investment Corp.,
dismissed his allegations.
   An SEC spokeswoman said the agency "has been concerned
about `front-running' for a long time," but said that "clubs
of firms sharing trading information is a new one on us.
We've not heard of that particular situation."

   STRANGE BEDFELLOWS: The SEC may soon find itself siding
with a former adversary, the Belzberg family.
   The target of the team effort: the new Pennsylvania
anti-takeover statute, signed into law last week, that became
the toughest such provision in the country. The law forces
short-term shareholders who try to take over a company to
disgorge profits from their stock purchases if the takeover
attempt fails. It was enacted just before the Belzbergs were
to take on Armstrong World Industries Inc. in a proxy fight.
   The Canadian investors sued in federal court, challenging
the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania law. They contend
that the law "fundamentally alters the relationship between
the corporation and its shareholders."
   Now it looks like the SEC will file a friend-of-the-court
brief on the side of the Belzbergs. SEC Chairman Breeden has
objected to the law, contending that it would unfairly affect
the proxy process and could entrench management. General
Counsel Goelzer said the agency is still studying whether to
file a brief on behalf of the Belzbergs' position.
   Teaming the SEC and the Belzbergs would be an ironic twist
from the last time the two met. That was in a 1988 court
fight, after the SEC sued to recover $2.7 million over what
the agency contended was misleading disclosure of Ashland Oil
Inc. holdings by Marc Belzberg and First City Financial Corp.
The SEC, which won the case and subsequent appeal, used it to
expand existing law to force disgorgement of profit in a
disclosure case, previously a tactic used almost exclusively
in instances of insider trading.
   Mr. Goelzer is quick to point out that any help would be
to support a change in law, not support the Belzbergs. "We're
not trying to help the plaintiff," he said. "It's solely in
the principles of the case."

   THE RIFT WIDENS between SEC Chairman Breeden and the
commission's most senior member, Edward Fleischman.
   The two Republicans are trying to coexist, but simply
don't see eye-to-eye on the issues. Mr. Breeden is a
big-picture guy; Mr. Fleischman, a detail-oriented securities
lawyer.
   Mr. Breeden knows that he rarely needs Mr. Fleischman for
a majority vote on the commission. And Mr. Fleischman has
publicly objected to several recent SEC actions, clearly to
the annoyance of Mr. Breeden, who would prefer the appearance
of unanimity.
   Specifically, Mr. Fleischman objected to Mr. Breeden's
view that the SEC should have jurisdiction over stock-index
futures, pulling that power away from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. Mr. Fleischman informed the Senate of his
disagreement in a footnote to Mr. Breeden's testimony on the
subject.
   And on the SEC's recently passed Rule 144a, which expands
the private-placement market, Mr. Fleischman wrote a harshly
worded dissent to several provisions. For example, in arguing
that the rule doesn't help small companies enough, Mr.
Fleischman wrote, "I am astonished; I dissent; I reprehend."
