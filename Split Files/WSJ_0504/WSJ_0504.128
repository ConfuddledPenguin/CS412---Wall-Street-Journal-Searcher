   HOUSTON -- Seagull Energy Corp. said it made a natural-gas
discovery off the Texas coast.
   The Brazos 399G-2 well was drilled in 60 feet of water 15
miles south of Freeport, Texas, in the Gulf of Mexico,
encountering production at intervals ranging from 7,155 to
8,000 feet. The zones tested flowed 22 million cubic feet of
gas a day through chokes ranging from 18/64 to 22/64-inch, at
flowing tubing pressures ranging from 1,700 to 2,575 per
square inch.

   Seagull operates the well and has a 37.5% working
interest, and other partners include Ashland Exploration Inc.
with 37.5% and Southwestern Energy Co. with 25%.
