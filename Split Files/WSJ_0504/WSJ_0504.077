   NEW YORK -- Avon Products Inc. shareholders, rejecting
advice of management, urged reconsideration of the company's
anti-takeover plan.
   Although the two votes aren't binding on the board, they
provide further evidence of weak shareholder support for the
cosmetic company's management, which last year and this has
faced calls for a takeover and threatened proxy contests by
several groups.

   Avon recently averted a proxy contest from its largest
holder, Chartwell Associates L.P., by agreeing to put two
Chartwell representatives on its board. The agreement also
called for the formation of a special committee to seek ways
to maximize shareholder value. The committee will include two
Chartwell representatives and four incumbent Avon board
members.
   But Chartwell didn't sign a standstill agreement, and has
since been acquiring more Avon shares. Chartwell has control
of nearly 12.5% of Avon, and has about 16.6% of the common
shares.
   About 60% of shareholders who voted endorsed two separate
proposals concerning Avon's anti-takeover plan. One
recommended that the plan be redeemed or submitted to a
shareholder vote; another sought a vote on the plan. About
29% of holders voting abstained from voting on those
measures.
   A spokesman for Avon said the vote wasn't unexpected. "I'm
sure the board will take the vote into consideration," he
said. He said that a shareholder proposal to put the
anti-takeover plan to a vote passed last year. Shareholders
also supported a proposal to institute confidential voting,
but voted against one to establish a shareholders' advisory
committee.
   Chartwell Associates consists of oil heir Gordon Getty,
cosmetics rival Mary Kay Corp., Mary Kay's vice chairman,
John Rochon, and the Fisher real estate family of New York.
   The compromise between Avon and Chartwell called for
supporting a slate of nominees to the board that included two
Chartwell representatives, as well as James E. Preston,
Avon's chairman and chief executive officer, and Charles S.
Locke an incumbent board member. That slate was approved at
the meeting. Mr. Rochon, who will leave his post at Mary Kay,
will advise the committee.
   Avon recently attempted to stiffen its anti-takeover plan,
proposing to lower the ownership threshold that would trigger
the plan; a federal judge blocked that attempt. Avon is
appealing the ruling. At the same time, Avon sent a letter to
Chartwell suggesting the group refrain from acquiring more
shares in the company, because Avon believed the purchases
would unfairly influence its desire to maximize shareholder
value.
   "I'm pleased to see it passed; poison pills are in general
inappropriate," said Robert L. Renck Jr., president of R.L.
Renck &amp; Co., a New York brokerage firm and Avon shareholder.
   Mr. Preston, the Avon chairman, said the special committee
would "review all the options," including a possible sale of
Avon. But he said Avon isn't for sale, and stressed that
there aren't any "hostile relations" between Chartwell and
Avon.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Avon shares closed at $36.375, down 75 cents.
