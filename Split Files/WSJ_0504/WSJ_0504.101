   NEW DELHI -- China's central bank governor said yesterday
that a further decline in interest rates is unlikely and also
ruled out the likelihood of a further devaluation of the
yuan.
   Li Guixian expressed satisfaction at the results achieved
by December's 22% cut in the value of the Chinese currency.
He said China's exports have improved satisfactorily, while
imports have been restrained, allowing a rise in the
country's foreign exchange reserves.

   "I think the effects are positive," he stated, but added
that "We don't have any plans to continue this kind of
practice," referring to prospects for a further devaluation.
   Mr. Li was in India to lead his country's delegation to
the 23rd annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank, which
is being attended by more than 2,000 delegates, bankers and
government officials.
