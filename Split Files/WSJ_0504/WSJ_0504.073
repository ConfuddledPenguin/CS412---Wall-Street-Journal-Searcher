   Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., stung by a sharp
increase in troubled assets, reported a first-quarter loss of
$98.1 million, or 92 cents a share, compared with profit of
$92.4 million, or 84 cents a share, for the year-earlier
quarter.
   The quarterly loss -- the company's first since 1974 --
stemmed from a $367 million provision for possible loan
losses. The loss would have been larger had it not been for
$90 million in pretax gains from the sale of part of the
Providence, R.I., company's credit-card portfolio and a
change in the investment structure of its pension plan.

   On Wall Street, where investors had worried about the
outcome of federal regulators' recent examination of the
bank, the news apparently wasn't as bad as feared. In active
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Fleet/Norstar closed at $19.25, up 50 cents.
   The results are "nothing to jump up and down about
obviously," said Dennis Shea, an analyst with Morgan Stanley
&amp; Co. "But it's nice to see there wasn't an extraordinary
degree of deterioration" in underlying earnings and in asset
quality. Mr. Shea noted that several of the company's
nonbanking financial service operations continued to perform
strongly.
   But Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it placed on CreditWatch
with negative implications its ratings on about $2.2 billion
of Fleet/Norstar's long-term debt. The rating company said
the results "show a higher-than-expected increase in
nonperforming assets, confirming that regional economic
troubles, especially in real estate, have not abated."
   Terrence Murray, chairman and chief executive officer,
said in an interview that Fleet/Norstar expects to be
profitable in the next three quarters, and to show a profit
for the full year. He declined to be more specific. Mr.
Murray said federal regulators have completed their
examination of the bank and "are aware of" the company's
earnings statement, but haven't submitted their final report
on the exam.
   Nonperforming assets jumped to $928 million, or 4.3% of
related assets at March 31. That's up sharply from the $400
million, or 1.8%, at Dec. 31 -- but still below the
proportions at New England's other big commercial banks. Of
the March 31 total, $552 million is related to commercial
real estate, the company said. The total includes $275
million in foreclosed real estate, compared with $80 million
at Dec. 31. Assets in that category are written down to
market value.
   Mr. Murray said he sees "no signs of a turnaround" in the
New England real estate market. "I think it's been on a slide
for a year and it will continue to slide through the rest of
the year."
   But he predicted that many of the assets classified as
nonperforming will prove to be sound. "Historically, less
than 25% of nonperforming loans are actually lost through
nonpayment," he said.
   The first-quarter loan-loss provision brings total
reserves to $595 million, or 91% of nonperforming loans and
64% of total nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets
include those on which payments are past due, or that seem
likely to become delinquent because of market trends or the
borrowers' financial condition. Some $412 million of the $928
million in nonperforming assets were contractually current or
past due fewer than 90 days, according to John Flynn, chief
financial officer. Mr Flynn said the company's regulators had
used "conservative" assumptions in evaluating loan quality.
   Fleet/Norstar said its mortgage banking operation, Fleet
Mortgage Group, contributed $10 million in net income, or 77%
more than a year earlier. Earnings for Fleet Finance, the
company's Atlanta-based consumer finance subsidiary, rose
19%, to $11 million.
   Mr. Murray said the company increased its liquid assets by
more than $5 billion, mainly in the form of Treasury bills,
since late last year. Fleet/Norstar relies on commercial
paper and other outside funding sources for its nonbanking
operations, analysts note, so the extra liquidity would help
if commercial-paper buyers turn skittish.
   Fleet/Norstar also declared the usual quarterly dividend
of 35 cents a share, payable July 1 to stock of record June
15.
