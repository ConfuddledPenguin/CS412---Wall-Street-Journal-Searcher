   Deutsche Lufthansa AG Chairman Heinz Ruhnau said the West
German airline will hire approximately 500 employees of
German Wings, a Munich-based private air carrier that filed
for bankruptcy this week.
   Mr. Ruhnau told reporters that Frankfurt-based Lufthansa
had planned to add 3,500 employees this year anyway. He said
he ordered personnel directors to give priority to job
applicants from German Wings.

   The Lufthansa chairman said the company has little
interest in taking over German Wings's six leased McDonnell
Douglas Corp. MD-83 twin jets, because they don't fit into
Lufthansa's own fleet.
   With regards to Interflug, the East German national
airline, Mr. Ruhnau said he favored increased cooperation
between the two German carriers, but foresees a future where
both continue to operate independently, even after the
planned unification of the two Germanys.
   Lufthansa is in the process of acquiring a 26% stake in
Interflug; the two companies have also set up a catering
joint venture.
