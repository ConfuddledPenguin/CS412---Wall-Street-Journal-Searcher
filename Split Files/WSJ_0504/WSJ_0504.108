   CANBERRA -- The Australian government reported a budget
deficit of 1.45 billion Australian dollars (US$1.09 billion)
for the first nine months of this fiscal year ending June 30,
narrowing from a budget deficit of A$2.05 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   For the full fiscal year, the government has predicted a
record budget surplus of A$9.33 billion. Much of its revenue
is collected in the final few months of the fiscal year.

   Ralph Willis, finance minister, said in a statement that
revenue for the first nine months rose 7.6% from a year
earlier, while spending rose 6.3%.
   Mr. Willis said the growth in cumulative spending and
revenue is "broadly in line with the budget forecast" made
last August.
