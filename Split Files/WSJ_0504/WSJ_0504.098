   GENEVA -- OPEC's oil ministers pledged to cut their
combined output by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day in an
urgent effort to shore up sagging petroleum prices.
   If all 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Countries conscientiously honor their promises, they'd
essentially wipe out the full amount of OPEC's recent
over-ceiling production, which is blamed for most of the 25%
drop in world oil prices this year.

   Even if they don't, substantial compliance with the
unanimous agreement could at least ease the current oil glut.
   The development, nevertheless, was greeted with skepticism
in oil markets. Despite the fact that the mere scheduling of
the session had halted a worsening price slide in late April,
prices fell yesterday on reports of the agreement. The June
contract for West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 69 cents
to $17.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The accord came early on the second day of the emergency
talks here, in keeping with the ministers' hopes for a
display of swift and decisive action. They have reasoned that
oil markets would be calmed by a brief and controversy-free
meeting. Ironically, the session was OPEC's first in some
time at which ministers had to address sharing output cuts,
rather than increases.
   Puzzled by the new price declines, the oil ministers still
held that their intent to reduce sharply the flow of oil
would eventually restore stability to volatile markets and
firm up prices.
   "Prices will definitely improve; I'm willing to put my
money on it," Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil
minister, said in an interview.
   With the agreement calling for each country to make a
contribution, OPEC calculated the overall reduction at
1,445,000 barrels a day. That would bring production down to
22,055,000 barrels a day from April's estimated 23.5 million
barrels a day, and would make it about equal to the
organization's widely ignored first-half ceiling.
   The pledged cuts are effective for the months of May, June
and July. The idea is to remove enough oil -- at least one
million barrels a day -- from a glutted market to stabilize
prices until OPEC is beyond the current quarter, which has
been characterized by sluggish oil demand. During the third
quarter, world-wide use of petroleum generally begins to
rise.
   Pressure at the meeting for output reductions fell most
heavily on big overproducers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates. Both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
obligated themselves to cut back to their quotas of 5.4
million and 1.5 million barrels a day, respectively.
According to working figures used by other oil ministers in
calculating total reductions, that suggests cuts of 430,000
barrels a day for Saudi Arabia and 400,000 barrels a day for
Kuwait from recent actual rates.
   The United Arab Emirates, which had been flatly refusing
to recognize its quota in any manner, in effect rejoined OPEC
by agreeing to participate in the cutback plan. Mana Said
Otaiba, the UAE oil minister, told reporters: "We are
producing 2.1 million {barrels a day}. We promise to cut
200,000 {barrels a day}. So we will produce 1.9 million until
the end of July."
   Some questions arose about previous promises made by the
ministers of Kuwait and UAE, both chronic quota violators.
OPEC sources said Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah of Kuwait wouldn't
accept a cutback here unless the UAE dropped down at least
300,000 barrels a day and other overproducers also returned
to their quota limits.
   Mr. Otaiba was finally pushed to the point that he asked
his government for permission to cut, but only by 200,000
barrels.
   To salvage what seemed to be a shaky situation, Mr.
Ginandjar, the Indonesian minister, then proposed trimming
Indonesia's production by 40,000 barrels a day, even though
it isn't currently producing its full quota.
   Other volunteers also chipped in to help offset the UAE's
"missing" 100,000 barrels and satisfy Kuwait. At one time
during tense negotiations that went into the morning, the
Iranian and Iraqi ministers returned from a private
conference to offer cuts of 20,000 barrels a day each. Both
countries, like Indonesia, are also producing under-quota.
   "The principle is that everybody participates, no matter
how small," said OPEC's Secretary-General Subroto.
   The marketplace actually may have already accomplished
some of the cuts OPEC is counting. Members' sales of crude
oil recently have slackened, because buyers' storage
facilities are filled to their brims. By one estimate, OPEC's
output already has dropped as much as 500,000 barrels a day
from April's 23.5 million average.
   Still, some ministers suggested that "real" cuts of around
one million barrels a day would soon be evident in the oil
markets. "That should be enough," said one.
   Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and acting OPEC
president, disclosed that OPEC's next ministerial conference
was postponed to July 25 from a June date. At that meeting,
OPEC will determine production levels and country quotas for
the remainder of the year. By then, he said, demand for
OPEC's oil should be increasing again. "Some forecasts are
that it could be at least 24 million {barrels a day} in the
fourth quarter," he said.
