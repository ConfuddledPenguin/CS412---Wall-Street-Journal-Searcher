   PHILADELPHIA -- Long-distance phone companies are becoming
more aggressive in the potentially lucrative business of
selling callers' phone numbers -- as well as their names,
addresses and more personal data.
   The carriers are wading into the controversy over caller
identification with products that identify callers to 800 and
900 lines. While the Caller I.D. debate has centered on
individuals calling other individuals, the new long-distance
services are likely to shift the focus to companies capturing
data, massaging it and passing it along to other companies
for marketing purposes.

   The emerging phone-company services make it effortless for
companies to compile mailing lists for direct mail or
telemarketing purposes or to sell or rent to other companies.
At the same time, some companies that operate 800 or 900
numbers are building their own mailing lists by matching
numbers supplied by long-distance companies with consumer
data bases. Generally, about half of all calls to 800 and 900
numbers can be accurately matched with the head of the
household and the address.
   The commercial uses of consumers' telephone numbers raise
concerns beyond the debate over local phone companies'
transmitting Caller I.D. That's because companies, more
easily than individuals, can link the numbers with data bases
containing personal credit history, marital status,
automobile purchases, names and addresses of neighbors and
so-called psychographic data on spending habits and product
preferences -- a window, if you will, into a callers' life
style.
   "The phone companies are now in a position to add value
beyond just a phone call," says H. Skip Weitzen, vice
president of strategic planning for Optima Direct, a small
Washington direct-marketing campaign firm. "On the other
hand, the phone companies need to consider the privacy
implications of such enhancements."
   Leading the emerging market for telephone company matching
is US Sprint Communications Corp., a subsidiary of United
Telecommunications of Kansas City, Mo. A Sprint Gateways
service called Targetlist lets customers choose whether they
want a printout, a computer tape or mailing labels. Sprint
can also provide names of nine neighbors, and can let callers
record their own name and address at the end of the 900-line
message. The company is planning yet another service that
draws a callers' demographic and psychographic profile, says
Adrian Toader, Sprint Gateways director of sales and
marketing.
   Retailers and other businesses, he says, are just
beginning to figure out how it can help them sell their
products. "So far, few companies know what to make of the
service," Mr. Toader acknowledges. "But Targetlist was ahead
of its time." With 900 service, callers are already
motivated, he says, because they pay for the calls.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which has a healthy
and growing business of providing callers' numbers to 800 and
900 customers, isn't yet providing names and addresses. MCI
Communications Corp. of Washington recently put its toe in
the water, providing names and addresses to a few businesses.
"We're not ready to mass market a product," says Patricia
Proferes, an MCI marketing specialist. "But we are talking to
a lot of different folks about marketing an off-the-shelf
automatic number identification solution package."
   Among the recipients of callers' names and addresses is
evangelist and politician Pat Robertson's Christian
Broadcasting Network. Paul Flanagan, CBN's vice president for
information services, said MCI has been delivering the data
on callers to CBN's counseling, prayer and information lines.
The information, he said, is merely piling up while CBN
figures out what -- if anything -- to do with it. Mr.
Flanagan says the names won't be used for direct mail or
telemarketing. "If somebody doesn't want mail, it's a waste
of postage, and may only make someone angry," he said. "We
look for more of a personal touch."
   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of this newspaper and owner of
the 900-Journal line, is one of the Targetlist customers. A
Dow Jones spokesman said the company started collecting the
data in January. "It's just going on the shelf," he says, "It
is cheaper to collect it now than to go back and gather it
later." The spokesman said the data has potential for use in
internal research.
   Even on the shelf, the computer tapes and printouts worry
privacy experts. "Computer matching violates a central rule
of fair information practices," said Marc Rotenberg, director
of the Washington office of Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility. "It undermines a caller's expectation of
privacy and should be prohibited." Mr. Rotenberg finds the
long-distance angle particularly troubling because more and
more consumers use 800 and 900 services. A recent study by
Strategic Telemedia of New York shows that 800 service has
been growing at an annual rate of 10% to 12% in recent years,
with revenues projected to reach $6 billion this year. The
study projects that 900 service, estimated at $455 million
last year, will soar to $3 billion by 1993.
   To be sure, the identification of long-distance callers
could have limited value. Calls made from offices, public
places and phones with unlisted numbers generally don't wind
up on mailing or telemarketing lists. And phone companies and
their business customers are concerned about privacy
implications, especially since congressional support grows
for a bill introduced by Sen. Herb Kohl (D., Wis.) that would
limit local phone companies' ability to provide callers'
numbers. The bill, however, doesn't directly address
commercial use of data from long-distance companies.
   Consumer research from Advertising Research Corp. and
Strategic Telemedia found that about a third of callers
wouldn't dial 800 lines if they knew their phone number was
going to be captured. "Companies are taking a wait-and-see
attitude because of fears of bad press and legislation," says
Bruce Kushnick, president of Strategic Telemedia.
   Nevertheless, the business of interactive telephone
services that let callers push buttons to play games or
transmit information such as age or sex -- and the lists they
can generate -- is mushrooming, says Robert Lorsch, president
of Teleline Inc., a Los Angeles company that has produced
such interactive 900 services as the "Lets Make a Deal" line
and CBS's soap opera update line. Information providers as
well as telemarketing service bureaus, he says, are
developing dual income streams from their 900 numbers -- one
from charging callers and the other from selling or renting
lists. "Most companies in the information industry haven't
figured out the proper non-invasive use of number
identification and data capture," he says.
   "This is the fastest, cheapest, easiest way to build a
direct response mailing list," says Optima Direct's Mr.
Weitzen. "And the back-end value is that you can market names
of people who are phone-responsive to catalog and
telemarketing companies. It's something consumers should
understand."
