   ARLINGTON, Texas -- BizMart Inc. said its sales for the
fourth quarter ended April 28 more than tripled to about
$45.1 million, from $14.8 million a year ago.
   The office-products chain, which now has 32 stores, said
its sales for the fiscal year were about $132.8 million, up
from $33.5 million in fiscal 1989. BizMart opened its first
store in May 1988.

   The company said it expects to have been profitable in the
fourth quarter, despite store-opening costs, poor weather
conditions and increased competition. But it said it will
post a net loss for the fiscal year when it reports its
results in mid-June.
