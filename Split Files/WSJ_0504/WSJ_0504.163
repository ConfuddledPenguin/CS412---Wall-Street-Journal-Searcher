   NEW YORK -- Leslie Fay Co. said its largest shareholder,
Goldome Savings Bank, and a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. unit plan to
sell a 21% stake in Leslie Fay shares, with a current market
value of $45.9 million.
   In a registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the women's apparel maker said the
holders plan to sell 4,125,000 of their 19.1 million common
shares outstanding. The prospectus said that Goldome, and its
related Goldome Foundation, plan to sell a total of 3.5
million of the four million Leslie Fay shares they own.

   A Leslie Fay spokesman said that it filed the statement
because Goldome approached the company about selling the
shares it owns. According to the spokesman, Goldome became a
limited partner in a New Jersey partnership that in 1984 took
Leslie Fay private in a leveraged buy-out. In 1986, when
Leslie Fay went public again, the partnership interest was
exchanged for Leslie Fay shares.
   Goldome, Buffalo, N.Y., declined to comment. The thrift
has been taking a number of actions to improve the company's
capital position in order to meet minimum capital
requirements as it focuses on consumer banking.
   According to the filing, Merrill Lynch Interfunding Inc.
plans to sell 655,435 of the 1.44 million Leslie Fay shares
it owns. Merrill Lynch didn't return phone calls seeking
comment.
   Leslie Fay shares closed yesterday in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at $11.125, down 25 cents.
   The selling shareholders have granted the underwriters of
the offering -- Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. and First Boston Corp. --
the right to purchase up to an additional 595,150 shares to
cover over-allotments.
