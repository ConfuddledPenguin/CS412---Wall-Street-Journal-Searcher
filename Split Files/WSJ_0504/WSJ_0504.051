   NEW YORK -- Do your salesmen shirk from making cold calls?
Why not ply them with portable showers, inflatable hot tubs
or 3-D cameras?
   Are your workers turning out too many widgets with busted
switches? A four-pound Chateaubriand might shape them up.

   Saddled with 180 gross of lavender pantyhose? Maybe they
would fly off the shelves -- if you packaged them with rubber
squid keychains.
   Your business, large or small, could no doubt solve
nagging managerial woes simply by offering up the products
displayed at the 52nd annual Premium Incentive Show here this
week. Or so say some 1,800 exhibitors flogging their wares
before an estimated 34,000 would-be buyers.
   There are prizes for quota-busting salesmen, awards for
quality and service contests, freebies to boost slow-selling
products, and giveaways to massage clients and customers. At
this show, the talk is of patents pending, bulk discounts and
custom imprints. Phrases like "incent your work force" and
"so unique" abound.
   The giveaway industry is big business -- nearly $16
billion annually, according to Incentive Magazine, a trade
publication. This show, filling two floors of the cavernous
Javits Convention Center, is like a giant garage sale, where
Fortune 500 companies jostle with Malaysian tropical fish
importers, and where such big-ticket items as refrigerators
and projection television sets share space with beach
headrests, steak knives, levitating globes and talking
crystal balls.
   Cigars and booze are declasse as perks for customers and
suppliers, declares Jeff Robinson, president of Totally
Chocolate of Valencia, Calif. Instead, he suggests his wares:
corporate chocolate bars emblazoned with company logos.
"Chocolate has an image of being friendly, family-oriented
and acceptable," he says. Some examples from his brochure:
slabs of one to three pounds bearing such messages as,
"Tomorrow's Technology Taking Control" for Textron and "We
Wouldn't Go Anywhere Without You" for TWA.
   A salmon fisherman came all the way from Seattle to
display his goods. While fish can't be personalized, Taylor
Phillips, president of Seattle Select Smoked Seafood, says
Sockeye salmon still makes a great corporate gift. "It's
quality," he says. "It's a healthy item." You can stockpile
the vacuum-packed fish for ace salesmen contests, too: "We
recommend you eat them within a year, but I've seen packages
of this after four years, and they're still edible," he says.
   Sometimes all it takes to unload mongrel products is a
little something extra. Standing at a table laden with rubber
squid keychains and Christmas ornaments, Robert Powell, of
Olympia, Wash., claims his little plastic compasses were the
making of the Mobil Road Atlas. When the two items were
paired last year, he says, the books "blew out" of the
stores.
   Katherine Cowles, vice president of H.M. Gousha, a
division of Simon &amp; Schuster, which publishes the atlases,
agrees: "These compasses were just wonderful. Not only did
they help sell {the atlases} but we showed the stores we were
behind the product."
   Then there are the crystal ball and levitating globe, both
made by With Design in Mind International Inc., of
Chatsworth, Calif. Wouldn't anybody give his all to own a
globe that actually floats in midair, as the brochure
exclaims? "Spin it] Touch it] There is nothing holding the
globe]"
   Steve Zuloff, president, explains that the globe floats
through a combination of magnets and rapidly alternating
electric currents -- "the technology developed for the bullet
train in Japan."
   The talking crystal ball looks like your ordinary crystal
ball -- but it sounds different. Ask it questions designed
for a yes or no answer, pass your hand over the globe, and
you get one of 28 pre-programmed answers. "Does she love me
only for my body?" brings a randomly selected response such
as: "My sources say without a doubt." "Absolutely." "It is
not destined." "It is not in the stars." Or, "Concentrate and
ask again."
   R.P. Pat on the Back Inc. of Lindenhurst, N.Y., draws
plenty of stares at its booth with the Congratulator, which
workers can use to give themselves the recognition they don't
get from others. Pull a string on the shoulder-mounted
contraption and a wooden hand pats the user's own back. "To
that special employee," a brochure explains, "the
Congratulator says thank you."
   Some buyers cringe. "That's the most stupid thing I've
seen in my life," says Jan Schuster, a premium distributor
from West Germany.
   No trend escapes the notice of the giveaway promoters. One
touts the environmental merit of fancy shopping bags.
"They're reusable," she says. A maker of jump ropes with
corporate logos on the handles claims he has drawn interest
from five big pharmaceutical companies. "It's a fitness
product," he says. "It makes a nice tie-in."
   Vital Body Marketing Co.'s relaxing tapes -- the sounds of
rain forests, birds and zithers -- are usually sold through
bookshops and health food stores. But Jeffrey Charno,
president of the Glen Cove, N.Y., firm, says one company
ordered 500 sets packaged with massage oil for its salesmen.
"Everyone is pretty aware of the cost of stress and the
pleasures of relaxation," he says.
   A personal alcohol breath tester imprinted with the
corporate name or slogan would make a fine gift to boost
morale -- and it could reduce company liability, maintains
Rick Snyder, a representative of U.S. Alcohol Testing of
America Inc., in Paramus, N.J. "Companies don't want people
going home from company picnics and getting into car
accidents," he says.
   One company even suggests capitalizing on executives'
fears. As a corporate giveaway, the "Citizen defense shield,"
a bulletproof liner for luggage, "makes an unforgettable
statement of concern and caring," says a brochure from
Prudent Technologies Inc., of Rowayton, Conn.
   "We all have a steak in quality" reads the posters that
New York Steak provides with its prepackaged quality
programs. "They put them in the plant to create excitement,"
says Jerry Romanoff, president. The company also provides a
bingo set. For every week of no-defect production or
no-accident production, managers draw five more balls for a
plantwide bingo game. Winners can choose among goodies like
10 New York strip steaks, a four-pound Chateaubriand or, for
vegetarians not watching their weight, two 4 1/2-pound
cheesecakes.
   Why don't people just offer cash? "If I were to give you
$500, what would you do with it?" asks Clark Smaha, a
regional sales manager for Sony Corp. of America. "If I give
you a TV set, every time you turn it on, you think of the
company." Sony products are part of many incentive programs;
sales people who exceed quotas accumulate points they can use
to buy products.
   A tiny Sony Watchman television set is "the essence of
premiums," he says. "You wouldn't buy it for yourself, but if
you could win it, you'd love to have it."
   For some products at the show, success seems an unlikely
prospect. One man promotes devices that stores could use to
record audio messages; hidden within aisle displays, they
play their ads when they detect a person walking by. "The fun
begins and the sales follow]" gushes a flyer of the producer,
Hometown Marketing USA, of Manhasset, N.Y. Are any stores
using the devices now? Replies Jim Boyle, Hometown's
representative, "If they were, I wouldn't be here selling
them."
