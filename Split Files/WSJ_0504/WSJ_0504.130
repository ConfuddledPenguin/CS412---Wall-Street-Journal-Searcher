   DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built cars and trucks
rose 2.8% in late April, giving an upbeat finish to an
otherwise disappointing month.
   Overall, Americans bought 381,469 cars, trucks and vans in
the April 21-30 period, down from 371,153 vehicles a year
ago.

<TEXT>
   The seasonally adjusted annual selling pace of cars alone
was 7.1 million vehicles in late April. While that trailed
the 7.7 million-car pace a year ago, the latest figure was
well above the annual rate of 6.6 million cars for the first
two-thirds of the month.
   The late-April sales pace also exceeded analysts'
expectations of a 6.8 million-car selling rate for the
period.
   The gain, however, didn't overcome the car-market's
sluggishness earlier in the month. For all of April,
Americans purchased 1.2 million cars and trucks (domestic and
imported), down more than 9% from the 1.3 million bought a
year ago. Thus the industry's reaction to the late-April
results was tempered.
   "We aren't anticipating a big increase in industry sales,"
said David N. McCammon, Ford Motor Co.'s vice president for
finance. The company still expects overall car and truck
sales of 14.5 million vehicles this year, with the sales pace
in the year's second half slightly exceeding that of the
first half.
   Perhaps the most striking aspect of April's sales results
was the huge disparity of performance among individual
companies. Chrysler Corp.'s car and truck sales plunged
nearly 32% in the month, more than three times the decline in
the overall market.
   The company's share of combined car and truck sales
dropped 3.5 percentage points in April to 10.7%. That's about
what Chrysler's share of car sales alone has been in recent
years. And in cars, excluding trucks and minivans, Chrysler
was outsold by both Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. --
dropping Chrysler to fifth place in that category for April.
   Chrysler officials have blamed the decline on several
factors, including the company's refusal to engage in
unprofitable sales to daily-rental fleets. The company also
said that, after over-producing in 1989, it cut production of
some models too much this year.
   "We cut back inventory levels too low," a Chrysler
spokesman said. "We over-corrected for what dealers perceived
as an overstocked condition. We're trying like a dog to cure
that problem."
   General Motors Corp. fared substantially better. GM, whose
U.S. market share collapsed during the 1980s, increased its
share 0.7% during April. For the first four months of this
year, GM took 35.5% of U.S. car sales, slightly better than a
year earlier.
   GM posted strong sales of such models as the Pontiac Grand
Am and Grand Prix, Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme,
and the redesigned Chevrolet Caprice, which was launched in
April. Several of these models carried very generous buyer
incentives.
   Ford, meanwhile, saw its car-market share drop one
percentage point, to 22% in April, though its share of
combined car-and-truck sales dropped just 0.1% to 25.2%. Ford
officials said the company's market share has suffered
because Ford is just starting to launch two key models, a
version of the Ford Escort and a four-door Jeep-like vehicle
called the Ford Explorer.
   "We believe our shares will improve as the supply of our
new 1991 products increases over the next few months," the
company said in a statement released with first-quarter
earnings results.
   Among Japanese auto makers, results likewise were mixed.
Toyota was the clear winner with an 11.4% sales increase,
leading all major companies, domestic and import. Honda,
though, posted an 8% sales drop. A Honda spokesman said that
in April 1989 the company was running a dealer-incentive
program that helped boost sales, particularly toward the end
of the month. However, Honda didn't have any incentive
promotions this past month, the spokesman said.
   Several of the smaller Japanese auto makers also had sales
declines, although the U.S. marketing arm of Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. posted a 67% sales increase.
   Mercedes-Benz of North America had a 12.5% sales increase
in April, and so far this year its sales are running slightly
ahead of a year ago. Volkswagen AG's Audi of America
subsidiary, which has had a precipitous sales drop in recent
years, saw sales jump nearly 43% in April. The company is
aggressively promoting car-leasing programs.
