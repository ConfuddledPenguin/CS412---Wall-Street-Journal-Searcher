   Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association said federal
regulators approved its plan for meeting capital
requirements, but as part of the plan the big thrift must
raise $125 million to $150 million from outside investors by
June 1991.
   Scott Braly, president and chief executive officer of
Valley, Van Nuys, Calif., said investors currently have
little interest in buying stakes in S&amp;Ls because of the
industry's problems and a huge backlog of insolvent thrifts
that the government is trying to sell. But he said investors
may be more interested by mid-1991. If Valley can't meet the
terms of the capital plan, regulators can seek sanctions
against the lender, including seizure of the institution.

   Valley, which has assets of about $3 billion, earned
nearly $10 million in the first quarter, with about half of
the profit coming from the sale of branches. Mr. Braly said
the other half of the net income represented core earnings,
adding that he expected the first-quarter trend to continue
through out the year, indicating full-year core earnings of
roughly $20 million before special items. The thrift will
continue to operate under a "lockdown" order from federal
regulators, prohibiting new lending. Mr. Braly said the order
wouldn't affect expected profitability.
