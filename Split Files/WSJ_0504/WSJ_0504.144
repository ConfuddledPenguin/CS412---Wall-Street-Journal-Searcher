   TOKYO -- The sharp plunge in Japanese share prices this
year has forced stock dealer Akebono Kikaku Co. into
bankruptcy, a credit research agency reported.
   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. said Tokyo-based Akebono has
accumulated debt exceeding 210 billion yen ($1.33 billion)
and had allegedly issued bad notes twice since March 28. But
it is also possible that the $1.33 billion represented debts
by Akebono and several other companies controlled by two
major stock market speculators, Komei Tai and Seikichi Endo.
Whatever the source, it is the third-largest bankruptcy case
on record in Japan, the agency said.

   Despite a partial recovery in recent trading sessions,
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are more than 20%
below what they were at the start of the year. Teikoku Data
Bank said Akebono had been unable to meet margin calls
because of the steep fall in stock prices.
   Akebono, founded in 1979, dealt in speculative trading in
about 20 stock issues, including those of chemical,
electric-power and pharmaceutical companies, according to the
Kyodo News Service. The company also managed hotels in the
downtown Tokyo district of Shinjuku.
