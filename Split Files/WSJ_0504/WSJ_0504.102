   NEW YORK -- Stock prices added to this week's string of
gains, with the broad market performing better than blue-chip
issues for a change.
   However, prices finished well off session highs as the
market absorbed some profit-taking and futures-related sell
programs in advance of the April employment report.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied past 2700
in early trading after some opening hesitation and peaked at
midday with a gain of nearly 22 points, ended with a gain of
just 6.53 at 2696.17.
   But the ratio of advancing to declining issues on the New
York Stock Exchange weighed more heavily in favor of
advancers than it had Wednesday, when the Dow industrial
average rose 20.72 points.
   In the latest session, 901 Big Board issues recorded
gains, while 557 finished with losses. In Wednesday's
trading, advancers outpaced decliners 864 to 612.
   Additionally, broader averages recorded sharper advances
than did the Dow industrial average in percentage terms. The
30-stock average had a 0.24% gain. Standard &amp; Poor's
500-Stock Index went up 0.33%, and the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index climbed 0.34%.
   The S&amp;P 500 added 1.09 to 335.57, the Composite Index rose
0.63 to 183.97, while the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
advanced 1.00 to 312.40.
   Trading activity remained moderate as caution in advance
of the employment report, scheduled for release before
today's opening, weighed on the market. Volume on the Big
Board amounted to 145,570,000 shares, little changed from
Wednesday's total of 141,610,000.
   "The market just drifted during the afternoon from a lack
of interest," said W. Daniel Williams III, a vice president
of trading at Dillon, Read &amp; Co. "Something is keeping people
on the sidelines, and that's really uncertainty."
   The April employment data is expected to show that nonfarm
payrolls swelled during the month, primarily from the hiring
of temporary census workers. The consensus of economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for a
payroll increase of 384,000, with census employees accounting
for 211,000 of the gain, and an unchanged jobless rate of
5.2%.
   The Dow industrial average shows a gain of 51.12 points,
or 1.9%, for the week and has moved higher in six of the past
seven sessions.
   But in assessing the rally, some analysts have pointed to
weakness in measures of the market's breadth -- the
relationship between advancers and decliners -- as a sign
that its gains might prove to be short-lived.
   Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal
&amp; Co., said the market's latest performance represents "the
first sign of real improvement in breadth that we've seen in
some time."
   Mr. Seagle added that the evidence of buying interest in a
broad range of issues increases the chances for stocks to
continue rising once the market absorbs the employment data
and next week's $30.5 billion Treasury refunding.
   General Motors rose 3/8 to 45 1/8 on Big Board composite
volume of 1.1 million shares. Although the company's
first-quarter earnings dropped 54% from the year-earlier
level, the latest results were at the high end of analysts'
expectations. Separately, GM reported that its late April
U.S. car sales rose 4.1%.
   On the other hand, American International Group dropped 2
to 88 on 1.3 million shares despite reporting that earnings
for the first quarter rose 3.5%.
   N.V. Philips skidded 2 7/8 to 17 1/8 on 1.5 million in
response to its first-quarter report, which showed that gains
from the sale of most of its European defense units accounted
for almost all of its profit. Also, the company backed off
from earlier, optimistic forecasts.
   Wal-Mart Stores retreated 1 1/2 to 49 3/4 on 1.6 million
shares after a disappointing April sales report.
   J.C. Penney, whose April sales dropped 1.7% from a year
earlier, lost 3/8 to 63 1/4. Texaco rose 1/8 to 59 1/8 on 2.9
million shares, with one pair of institutional trades
designed to capture the next quarterly dividend payment on
the stock accounting for two million of the total. The oil
company's shares carry a 5% dividend yield and go without the
dividend today.
   Shares of single-country mutual funds extended a rally
that got under way Wednesday. Germany Fund rose 1 1/8 to 15
3/8, New Germany Fund advanced 1 to 15 1/8, Future Germany
Fund gained 1 to 16 1/8, Austria Fund rose 1 1/8 to 15 1/8,
Korea Fund rose 1 5/8 to 21 1/8, and Thai Fund climbed 1 1/4
to 22 1/4.
   Sundstrand, which surged 4 1/2 Wednesday, added 5 1/2 to
75 3/4. Speculation that the company may receive a takeover
bid of $100 to $110 a share from Westinghouse Electric fueled
the two-day rally, traders said. Both companies declined to
comment on the rumors.
   Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, which declared its regular
dividend of 35 cents a share despite reporting a
first-quarter loss, rose 1/2 to 19 1/4. The company also said
it anticipates returning to profitability in the second
quarter.
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi rose 5/8 to 5 3/8 on a report in the
Financial Times that the company is understood to have agreed
in principle to a management buy-out of its Hay Group
consulting unit. The report said the company had turned down
a bid from Bernard Krief Consultants, a French firm.
   Apple Bancorp climbed 2 1/2 to 44 1/8. The company,
targeted in a $38-a-share takeover bid by New York
real-estate investor Stanley Stahl, said several other
parties have expressed an interest in submitting rival
offers.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.74
to 344.97. Volume totaled 11,120,000 shares compared with
11,710,000 Wednesday.
