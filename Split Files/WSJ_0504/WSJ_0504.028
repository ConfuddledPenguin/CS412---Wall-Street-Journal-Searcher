   Investors bid bond prices modestly higher despite
uncertainty surrounding today's government report on April
employment, a key measure of economic activity. Stock prices
rose slightly.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained about 1/2
point, or about $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. The gain
pushed the yield on the issue below the psychologically
important 9% point, a signal that indicates worries about
inflation and interest rates may be waning.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.53 to 2696.17
points in relatively light trading. But that was sharply
below the nearly 22-point gain reached at midday. Analysts
said nervous investors decided to take profits in some of the
big blue-chip stocks ahead of the employment report.
   "There's good reason to take profits after we've had three
good days this week," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp. "A lot of the activity we saw
earlier this week was in trading accounts. Long-term
investors have continued to move to the sidelines, and they
decided to flatten out their positions before the employment
report."
   He said that report, the first comprehensive look at how
the nation's economy performed in April, will set the pace
for the bond market for the rest of May. And because the
stock market's health currently depends on the bond market's
performance, potential surprises in the jobs report are
keeping investors wary.
   The consensus expectation calls for nonfarm payrolls in
April to have grown by between 173,000 and 200,000, excluding
an estimated 200,000 census workers hired last month. That's
up considerably from the 26,000 increase in March, but isn't
high enough to spark worries about a rebounding economy
growing too fast.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose modestly in moderately light trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 145.6 million
shares. Advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of
declining issues 901 to 557.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices gained in light trading. The yield on the
Treasury's 30-year benchmark issue slid to 8.97%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6827 marks and 158.05 yen, compared
with 1.6848 marks and 157.95 yen Wednesday.
