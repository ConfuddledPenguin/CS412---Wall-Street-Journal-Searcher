   NEW YORK -- Apple Bancorp Inc. said it received
indications that parties other than the real estate investor
Stanley Stahl might be interested in taking over the bank
holding company.
   The bank has rejected Mr. Stahl's $38-a-share takeover
offer. Mr. Stahl controls 30.6% of Apple; his tender offer,
which he made late in March, values the rest of the company
at about $121.6 million.

   The parent of Apple Bank for Savings said it will provide
nonpublic data to these third parties. The bank declined to
identify either the possible suitors or the terms of any
possible proposal.
   The bank also is asking bank regulators to again review
Mr. Stahl's regulatory filings. In a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, the company disclosed two letters that its
attorneys, Thacher, Proffitt &amp; Wood, based here, sent to the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the office of the New
York state superintendent of banks.
   The bank's attorneys ask the regulators to make a "current
and careful reconsideration" of the November 1988 filings Mr.
Stahl made when he sought clearance to boost his stake in
Apple past 10%.
   The letters refer to recent published reports, which note
that Mr. Stahl once was convicted of bribing an Internal
Revenue Service agent, but the conviction was reversed on
appeal. Mr. Stahl had two retrials, the first ending in a
hung jury and the second in an acquittal. He previously
disclosed the matter to regulators.
   The articles note that he also is part-owner of
Manhattan's Ansonia Hotel; tenants there have had a longtime
battle with management about repairs.
   "Adverse public perceptions of the competence, experience
or integrity of any acquiring person, such as Mr. Stahl or
the members of the Stahl Group, would not be in the best
interests" of the bank's depositors or the public, one letter
says.
   Through a spokesman, Mr. Stahl declined to comment on the
letters.
