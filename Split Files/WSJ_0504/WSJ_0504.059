   Traditional Households
   Are Fading World-Wide

   THE U.S. ISN'T the only country in which nontraditional
households are becoming mainstream.
   The rise in numbers of single parents, unmarried couples,
and people living alone isn't unique to the U.S. A Bureau of
Labor Statistics study found that these situations are common
to most countries in the developed world. The difference is
in the pace at which these trends are progressing.
   Four main factors have changed the look of households and
families in the past two decades: Women are having fewer
children, more women are having children out of wedlock,
populations are aging, and marriage is down while divorce is
up.
   Japan remains the most traditional of the 13 developed
nations studied, with low rates of divorce and low rates of
out-of-wedlock births. It also has the largest share of
married couples.
   Sweden and Germany have the largest shares of
single-person households, in part because they have older
populations.
   Scandinavia has been setting the pace for out-of-wedlock
births and cohabitation. Sweden and Denmark have the largest
shares of births to unmarried women. Yet they don't have the
highest shares of single parents, because many unmarried
mothers in these countries live with partners.
   It's not clear which country has the highest share of
cohabiting couples because some countries now include them
with married couples in official household statistics. One
estimate shows that virtually all young Swedes cohabit before
they marry.
   The U.S. tops the list for single parents, partly because
of high divorce rates, but also because American single
parents are more likely to be young never-married women on
their own, rather than cohabitors.
                                                                                                       

   If Time Is Money,
   Soviets Need More
                                                                                                       

   CONTRARY to popular opinion, Japanese men don't work more
than everyone else. It is Soviet men who hold this dubious
honor.
   Researchers at the University of Michigan compared time
use in eight countries -- Japan, the U.S., U.S.S.R., Finland,
Hungary, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden -- and found that the
average Soviet man spends 54 hours a week earning a living,
compared with 52 hours for Japanese men and 44 hours for
American men. Danish men spend only 33 hours.
   Danish men consequently have the most leisure time, an
average of 54 hours a week. Japanese men have 40 hours of
leisure time while American men have 41. Soviet men, who work
more because of low wages, have only 35 hours of free time.
   Personal care, including eating and sleeping, ranges from
67 hours a week for men in Denmark to over 72 hours for those
in Japan, Finland and Hungary.
   Their other time-eater is the age-old women's activity:
housework. Swedish men are the most egalitarian in this,
doing 18 hours of housework a week. American men spend 14
hours a week on household chores, and Soviet men contribute
12 hours. Japanese men do just 3.5 hours a week.
   In all of the countries studied, women spend less time
than men earning a living and more time doing housework. True
to stereotypes, women also spend more time than men on
personal care, except in Japan and Hungary. Women have about
the same amount of leisure time as men in the U.S., Japan,
Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In the Soviet Union, Finland, and
Hungary, however, women have less leisure time than men.
                                                                                                       

   Stacking Up the Cities
   For U.S. Expatriates
                                                                                                       

   IF YOU HAD to relocate, which international city would be
the most like home in terms of living costs? Hint: Have a
vodka.
   Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm in
Rochester, Wis., measured living costs in major cities around
the world. The yardstick was a family of four, with annual
income of $75,000, living in Everywhere, U.S.A., where costs
are average for the nation. The study included costs for
housing, transportation, and goods and services such as food
and clothing. It didn't include taxes, whose impact varies
greatly with employer policy.
   To maintain the family's standard of living, it would cost
$74,200 in Moscow, putting that city on a par with home. Rome
also comes close, with a cost of $73,600. Warsaw is the
bargain basement among cities studied, with a comparable cost
of $40,800.
   In Toronto and Mexico City, the comparable cost of living
is lower than in the U.S., at $62,900 and $63,900
respectively. Stockholm is higher, at $83,800.
   The highest costs of all are in Asia. To maintain a family
of four in Seoul would take twice as much as it does in the
U.S., $151,300. In Tokyo, the costs skyrocket to $207,200 --
but that figure is based on a six-room home, a serious luxury
in land-scarce Japan.
                                                                                                       

   It Isn't Just the Geese
   Migrating From Canada
                                                                                                       

   AS OF THE 1980 Census, there were 843,000 Canadian-born
people living in the U.S. In the other direction, the 1981
Canadian census found 302,000 U.S.-born people living in
Canada, according to Statistics Canada, an Ontario agency.
   During the past few decades, migration between the two
countries has slowed, due to immigration restrictions on both
sides. Currently, about 16,000 Canadians move to the U.S.
each year, and fewer than 10,000 Americans move to Canada.
