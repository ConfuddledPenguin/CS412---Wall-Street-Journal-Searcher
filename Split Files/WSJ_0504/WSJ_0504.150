   BONN -- West Germany's industrial production dropped a
seasonally adjusted 0.7% in March from February but was up
3.7% from a year earlier, the Bonn Economics Ministry said.
   It added, however, that in a later update, an upward
revision of the monthly data by as much as 1.5 percentage
points can be expected.
