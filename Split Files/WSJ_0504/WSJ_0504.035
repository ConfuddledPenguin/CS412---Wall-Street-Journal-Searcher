   LONDON -- With the British government showing little sign
of caving in to pressure to make sterling a full member of
the European Monetary System now, some analysts suggest
Britain may not be ready to accept membership until after the
next general election.
   In recent weeks, a steady decline in sterling has
increased the calls from both outsiders and some of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's fellow Conservatives for
sterling to join the European Community's basket of
currencies.

   Entry into the exchange-rate mechanism of the EMS
generally would be expected to reinforce the government's
antiinflation commitment, help stabilize sterling and
eventually allow a reduction in interest rates. On a
political level, the move would counter criticism that the
government is too staunchly anti-European.
   However, some analysts now feel early entry could prove
counterproductive and might be ill-advised in the time left
before the next general election, which must be called by
mid-1992.
   Rather than protect sterling, they argue, EMS membership
would highlight Britain's inflation problems, make sterling
even more volatile and force the government to at least match
any rate increases by other members. This would put a further
squeeze on the British economy and accelerate an upturn in
unemployment that the government is trying to avoid before an
election.
   "Joining the mechanism this year would seem to be quite a
risky thing to do," said Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Yamaichi Securities. "It would force the government to take
corrective action it doesn't want to take."
   Certainly, there is little sign that the government is
even leaning toward early entry. Last weekend, Prime Minister
Thatcher continued to voice her opposition to swift moves
toward European economic and political union.
   And in an interview with a local newspaper, published
Monday, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major warned once
again that entry will make British interest rates volatile.
He indicated that he will continue to take a pragmatic
approach toward EMS entry, which he doesn't see as an easy
alternative to higher interest rates. "I'm not in the
business of pre-emptive surrender," he said.
   Economists have generally predicted that the government
will take sterling into the mechanism early next year. But
with the country's high inflation profile looking
increasingly stubborn and the government anxious to keep a
firm grip on its political fortunes, the chance of entry
before another election could be fading, some now contend.
   It would be difficult, said Chris Dillow, senior British
economist at Nomura Research Institute, to present early
entry as "anything other than a huge U-turn or panic measure"
by the government -- a move that could only worsen its
political plight.
   Mr. Major, the chancellor, has made it clear the most
important barrier to early entry is the current high level of
British inflation compared with the inflation levels of other
major EMS members. In March, the annual rate of British
inflation rose to 8.1% and is expected to climb over 10% by
midyear before declining toward the end of the year. The
average level of European inflation is about 3% and is
expected to climb to about 4% in the first half of 1991.
