   DENVER -- Cyprus Minerals Co. named a new chairman and
president and reorganized its top management structure.
   The mining company appointed former president Kenneth J.
Barr as chairman, succeeding John C. Duncan, 69 years old,
who was named vice chairman. Mr. Barr, 63, will remain as
chief executive officer.

   Chester B. Stone Jr., 55, was named president in Mr.
Barr's place, as expected. Mr. Stone, formerly senior vice
president for coal and iron ore, will also take the new title
of chief operating officer. Mr. Stone, who had been chief
financial officer until mid-1989, took over the coal and iron
ore operations last year in preparation for his naming as
president.
   Appointed to new executive vice president positions were
Donald P. Bellum, 57, and Thomas A. Williams, 54. Mr. Bellum
was senior vice president for metals, and Mr. Williams has
been senior vice president for specialty metals and
industrial minerals. Messrs. Bellum and Williams will report
to Mr. Stone, as will F. Steven Mooney, president of Cyprus
Copper Co., and Donald P. Brown, president of Cyprus Coal Co.
