   Two of the country's biggest retailers, Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and J.C. Penney Co., reported lower-than-expected April
sales.
   At Wal-Mart, sales at stores open more than a year rose
7%, while comparable-store sales dropped 2.8% at J.C. Penney.
Although the increase at Wal-Mart outstripped gains at other
retailers, it was a relatively disappointing showing by the
fast-growing retailer.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Wal-Mart dropped $1.50 to $49.75, while J.C. Penney fell 37.5
cents to $63.25.
   "Both chains were below plan for the month, and it appears
that men's and women's apparel was in part to blame," said
Robert Buchanan, an analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.,
Baltimore. "Both chains were at or above their plans from
January through March. They hit an air pocket in April."
   Four other major retailers, including Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co., reported mixed results for April.
   Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., had posted a 27%
surge in total sales and 12% same-store sales increases in
March. For the the 13-weeks ended April 28, comparable-store
sales rose 11%.
   Analysts attributed the softer April sales to heavy rains
that have plagued the South and Southwest, the discount
retailer's strongest regions, for much of the past month.
William W. Whyte, analyst for Stephens Inc. in Little Rock,
Ark., said that Wal-Mart's sales of higher-margin
Easter-related products were strong, but sporting goods, home
and garden and some apparel sales suffered because of the
weather. He said he is still predicting that the company will
earn 44 cents a share in the quarter ended April 28, compared
with 35 cents a year ago.
   "Any stock that trades at a premium is going to get hit
when expectations aren't met or exceeded," he said.
   At Dallas-based J.C. Penney, comparable-store sales in
April dropped 2.8% compared with April 1989, while comparable
store sales for the 13 weeks ended April 28 were up 4.3%.
   "J.C. Penney switched a major promotion aimed at Penney
credit card holders from April to March, so you had to expect
April sales wouldn't be good," said Mr. Buchanan.
"Nonetheless, I was surprised by the 2.8% decline. Home
furnishings were especially weak, and apparel was also soft."
J.C. Penney "did do well in children's apparel and children's
shoes. Overall, however, it wasn't a good picture," he said.
Mr. Buchanan added that he has reduced his estimate for
Penney earnings for the year to $6.50 a share from $6.60.
   "It's not a catastrophe, but they were down," added Stacy
Ruchlamer, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "I was
surprised to see the decrease in sales."
   William R. Howell, J.C. Penney's chairman, said that if
March and April sales results were combined, revenue was up
4.4% and comparable store sales gained 3.3%.
   "March and April should be evaluated together in order to
take into account the shift in Easter from March in 1989 to
April in 1990," he said.
   Analysts, however, said they believe it is still too early
to determine whether this will be a good year for most
retailers. "April sales were basically favorable, although
year-to-year comparisons were aided by the celebration of
Easter in mid-April compared to March 26 in 1989," said
Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "We still
believe the overall retailing outlook will be generally
sluggish. The good news is that retailers are intent on
maintaining strong control over inventory and expenses. We
expect industrywide profitability to show gradual improvement
on a quarter-to-quarter basis during the year."
   In recent weeks, several major retail chains have been
sold at very full prices. Both Marshall Field's and Saks
Fifth Avenue brought more than $1 billion each, an indication
that interest in top performing retailers is still strong.
"What this shows is that premiere properties will still bring
premiere prices," said M. Jeffrey Branman, managing director
of Financo Inc., a New York investment banking company that
specializes in retailing.
   Mr. Branman, noting that Federated Stores Inc. yesterday
removed Bloomingdale's from the auction block, said that
bankers are still wary of financing retail leveraged
buy-outs. "You're going to see fewer deals this year," he
said. "The banks have been burned too often. The only
transactions which will get done are those retailers which
have a compelling story to tell."
   Meanwhile at Sears, the nation's biggest retailer, sales
at stores open at least a year rose 3.1% in April on a
restated basis. For the 13 weeks ended April 28, the Chicago
company said comparable-store sales were up 2.1% on a
restated basis.
   "They were basically on plan, but I don't like the company
going forward," said Mr. Buchanan, the Alex. Brown analyst.
"Sears is in too many categories and spread too thin."
   Not reporting were such key stores as Limited Inc., K mart
Corp., and Gap Inc. Their sales figures will be available
next week.
