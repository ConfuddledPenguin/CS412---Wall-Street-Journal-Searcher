   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Finance Committee, looking into
why corporate tax receipts are lower and individual tax
receipts are higher than forecast under the 1986 Tax Reform
Act, found the explanation was rather elementary.
   The primary reason is corporate profits have been lower
than expected, and individual incomes have been higher than
expected, a Treasury official said.

   Harvey Rosen, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax
analysis, said that wages, salaries and interest rates have
been higher than expected in the three years since the tax
overhaul began taking effect. That has raised the income, and
the taxes, of individuals. It has also raised the costs of
corporations, squeezed their profits, and thus lowered their
taxes from what was forecast when the bill was passed.
   The 1986 law made sweeping changes in the corporate income
tax system. While it lowered the top tax rate for
corporations, it also repealed the investment tax credit,
limited depreciation deductions, restricted the use of net
operating losses and strengthened the alternative minimum tax
so corporations couldn't legally avoid paying tax.
   Together, these changes were expected to increase
corporate income tax receipts by $120 billion from 1987
through 1991. But so far, the receipts have fallen short of
government projections by between $20 billion and $25 billion
annually in 1987, 1988 and 1989, the Treasury estimated.
   Nevertheless, corporate tax receipts have grown each year
since the 1986 tax act. For 1989, they are believed to have
reached a record $104 billion, Mr. Rosen said.
   Moreover, Mr. Rosen said the tax law was succeeding in its
aim of shifting some of the tax burden from individuals to
businesses. "The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reversed a long-term
decline in the relative importance of corporate taxes in
producing revenues for the U.S. government," he said. "The
share of total taxes paid by corporations has been steadily
rising since 1986."
   Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget
Office, agreed with most of Mr. Rosen's assessments.
Testifying before the committee, he estimated that about 58%
of the shortfall in corporate tax receipts in the past three
years probably stemmed from lower-than-expected profits.
   Mr. Rosen and Mr. Reischauer also said an increasing
number of companies have chosen to organize as S corporations
or partnerships -- forms of business that are taxed at the
shareholder or partner level rather than the corporate level.
   Mr. Reischauer also said "an important cause of
lower-than-projected profits during the 1987-1989 period was
further increased reliance by corporations on debt financing
instead of equity financing."
   The 1980s saw a wave of leveraged buy-outs of companies,
deals that were largely financed by borrowing. Interest
payments on the debt load are tax-deductible and therefore
reduce the taxable income reported to the government.
   Consequently, the committee chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas, said the shortfall in corporate tax receipts wasn't
"just a question of interest rates having exceeded
expectations, but a question of the massive movement to debt
from equity in this country."
   But Mr. Rosen said that data so far suggest that leveraged
buy-outs had little impact on total corporate interest
payments.
   "The effect of LBOs on corporate profits is unclear," he
said, explaining that if the acquired firms are reorganized
and managed more efficiently, profits could increase, leading
to a higher tax bill.
