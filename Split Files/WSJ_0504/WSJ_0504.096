   OIL CITY, Pa. -- Quaker State Corp. said its Valley Camp
Coal Co. subsidiary received a five-year contract to supply
390,000 tons of coal annually to the Philip Sporn electric
generating plant at New Haven, W.Va.
   The power plant is owned by two units of American Electric
Power Co., Columbus, Ohio.

   The coal will be produced by a mine at Shrewsbury, W.Va.,
which will be reopened after having been closed in late 1986.
In addition, the mine will produce 100,000 tons annually of
stoker coal, a grade used in industrial boilers and other
facilities. The mine will employ 90 miners by September,
Valley Camp Coal said.
   The utility contract provides for flexible delivery rates
and allows the buyer to extend the contract by an additional
three to five years, the company said.
