   WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats unveiled a campaign-finance
proposal that would take most of the special-interest money
out of politics and replace it with public funds.
   "We have to slow down the money chase," said Sen. David
Boren (D., Okla.), an architect of the plan.

   The Democratic plan would require Senate candidates to
adhere to spending limits, based on the voting-age population
of their state. In return, they would receive a
taxpayer-financed subsidy to run their campaigns, as well as
reduced mail and broadcast costs.
   The Democratic plan would also prohibit contributions to
U.S. Senate candidates by political action committees. This
proposal follows the lead of Republican senators, who earlier
this week submitted a campaign-finance plan that would
abolish PACs altogether.
   It was unclear yesterday how many Democrats had actually
signed onto the plan for public funds, which will be
vigorously opposed by Republicans. Majority Leader George
Mitchell said he expected a "substantial majority" of
Democrats to embrace it.
   The plan would cost at least $120 million per election
cycle, according to estimates by Democratic Senate aides. The
funds would come from a voluntary taxpayer checkoff similar
to the system used for financing the presidential election.
The checkoff probably would be increased to $3 per individual
from $1 to cover the cost of congressional campaigns.
   But Republican critics immediately contended that the plan
would be far more costly. If House races were added, Sen.
Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who led a filibuster against
campaign-finance legislation two years ago, predicted the
Democratic plan would cost $400 million. "They surely must
know this isn't going anywhere," Sen. McConnell said
yesterday.
   "Their plan sounds more like a campaign rip-off than
campaign reform," said Republican Sen. Pete Wilson of
California.
   Many Republicans also oppose spending caps because most
incumbents are Democrats, and challengers usually need to
raise more money to win an election.
   To be eligible for the public funds under the Democratic
proposal, Senate candidates would have to raise a threshold
level of private funds (10% of the general election spending
limit in their state, at least half of which must come from
in-state individuals in amounts of $250 or less). Candidates
also would be permitted to exceed the spending limits by 25%
with small contributions ($100 or less) raised within the
state.
   In an effort to woo moderate Republicans, the Democratic
plan embraces broadcast provisions endorsed by Sen. John
Danforth (R., Mo.). Candidates would receive vouchers for
prime-time television advertisements of one to five minutes
during the eight weeks leading up to a general election. They
also would be required to appear on camera at the end of
their ads to take responsibility for the content. These
proposals would curb negative, "hit-and-run" campaign ads,
Sen. Boren said.
   The Democrats also proposed clamping down on large
contributions made by wealthy individuals to state political
parties, known as soft money, which isn't restricted by
federal laws.
   Several public-interest groups, including Common Cause and
Public Citizen, praised the Democratic plan.
   But almost everyone predicts difficult negotiations ahead.
"This can lead to a new system that fundamentally changes the
way business is conducted in Washington," said Common Cause's
Fred Wertheimer, "or it can lead to stalemate and status quo,
a disastrous result for the country."
