   PHILADELPHIA -- Cigna Corp.'s first-quarter net plunged
51% to $42 million, or 54 cents a share, due to catastrophe
losses and continued weak pricing in the property-casualty
market.
   The results were slightly worse than some analysts
expected, but were attributed to losses caused by severe
winter storms in Europe. Of the multinational insurers that
have reported first-quarter results so far, Cigna had the
largest exposure. The insurer's after-tax results were
reduced by $34 million, or 43 cents a share, because of these
catastrophe losses.

   The company's entire property-casualty group had a $24
million loss, compared with earnings of $42 million in the
1989 first quarter.
   "Assuming a normal level of catastrophes, I expect overall
earnings for the remainder of the year to be better than
1989," said Wilson H. Taylor, Cigna's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Udayan Ghose, an insurance-industry analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton in New York, said some of the weakness in the
results can be attributed to seasonal factors, such as a drop
in Cigna's group health earnings to $5 million from $15
million a year ago, excluding any investment gains. Yet, he
believes the shortfall will be made up during the rest of the
year and he doesn't plan to change any of his earnings
estimates for the company.
   Cigna's health maintenance organization, or HMO,
operations reported a profit of $7 million, compared with a
loss of $14 million a year ago.
   Revenue rose to $3.9 million from $3.7 million in the
year-ago quarter. The 1990 results included an after-tax net
realized investment gain of $2 million, compared with a gain
of $1 million in the 1989 period. The year-ago quarter also
included profit from discontinued operations of $13 million.
   Cigna completed the acquisition of Equicor, a Nashville,
Tenn.-based health-care company, in March, but it didn't
affect results.
