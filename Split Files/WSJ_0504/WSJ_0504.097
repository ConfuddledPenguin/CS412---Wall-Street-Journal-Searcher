   OTTAWA -- SHL Systemhouse Inc., a computer-systems
integration concern with a troubled parent, has put itself up
for sale.
   Systemhouse said it has net book value of 257.5 million
Canadian dollars (US$220.8 million). Its shares outstanding
have a current market value of $195.3 million. The shares
rose 75 cents yesterday to close at $5.25 a share in national
over-the-counter trading.

   Systemhouse said it retained Wood Gundy Inc. of Toronto
and Prudential-Bache Capital Funding of New York to seek a
buyer for all of its shares outstanding. A spokesman declined
to estimate how much the company might sell for.
   Ownership of the company has been in doubt since March,
when "severe financial difficulties" were reported by a
holding company controlled by Systemhouse's chairman and
chief executive officer, Roderick Bryden. Mr. Bryden couldn't
be reached yesterday.
   The closely held holding company, Kinburn Corp., said it
was unable to make payments on about C$816 million of loans.
Kinburn owns 50.1% of Systemhouse, and has pledged the shares
against the loans. The loans include C$415 million due to BCE
Inc. of Montreal, which owns 12.4% of Systemhouse.
   Talks between BCE and Kinburn broke down last month, and
an effort to find a buyer for Systemhouse was widely
expected. Raymond Cyr, chairman and chief executive of BCE,
said yesterday that it was too early to say whether his
company would be interested in bidding for Systemhouse.
   BCE's interests include a majority stake in Northern
Telecom Ltd., a large telecommunications equipment maker.
Systemhouse designs and installs integrated computer systems.
   Systemhouse reported net income of C$15.3 million for the
fiscal year ended Aug. 31, on revenue of C$630.8 million. It
reported a net loss of C$34.3 million in the second quarter
ended Feb. 28, including a C$25 million write-down of assets
and a C$6.9 million provision against debt owned or
guaranteed by Kinburn and Kinburn subsidiaries.
