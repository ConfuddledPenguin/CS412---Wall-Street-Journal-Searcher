   DETROIT -- The ten major U.S. auto makers planned to build
136,600 cars this week, down 10.7% from 153,030 a year ago.
   Domestic car makers said all of their facilities are
scheduled to operate next week, with several plants working
overtime.

   General Motors Corp. said it planned daily and weekend
overtime at its assembly plants in Wixom, Orion and
Hamtramck, Mich., Janesville, Wis., and Lordstown, Ohio.
   Ford Motor Co. has scheduled daily and weekend overtime at
its Lorain, Ohio; Twin Cities, Minn.; St. Louis, Mo.; and
Louisville, Ky., assembly plants.
   But Mazda Motor Corp. said it reduced its production
schedule for June and July by 1,300 cars. Mazda made the
adjustment because of an identical drop in orders for Probe
cars, which it builds for Ford at Mazda's assembly plant in
Flat Rock, Mich.
   In April, the ten major U.S. auto makers built 828,430
cars and trucks, down 16.9% from 997,926 the same month a
year ago.
   U.S. car output dropped 21.2% in April and truck and bus
production was down 9.3% compared to the year-earlier month.
