   In one of the largest judgments ever in a libel case
brought by a public figure, a jury ordered the Philadelphia
Inquirer to pay $34 million in damages to a former chief
assistant district attorney in Philadelphia.
   The award, which the Inquirer said it will appeal,
concerned a series of stories published in 1973 about Richard
A. Sprague, now a lawyer in private practice. The jury
awarded $2.5 million to compensate Mr. Sprague, 64 years old,
and the remainder, $31.5 million, to punish the Inquirer.

   The verdict, after a 10-week trial in Philadelphia's Court
of Common Pleas, is the second against the Inquirer in the
case. Mr. Sprague won $4.5 million in damages, including $3
million in punitive damages, in 1983. The Inquirer won a new
trial because the judge permitted jurors to draw adverse
inferences against the Inquirer when the reporters involved
exercised their right not to testify about information
gathered from unidentified sources.
   The stories suggested that as a top prosecutor, Mr.
Sprague quashed a homicide investigation in 1963 because the
son of a police captain had been in the apartment of the
victim, a homosexual, the night of the murder. The principal
author of the series, Greg Walter, who died last year, had
previously been successfully prosecuted by Mr. Sprague for
tape recording telephone conversations illegally and was
known among friends to hold a deep grudge. Mr. Sprague was a
friend of the father of one of the suspects.
   Although the appeals court ordered a second trial, it also
ruled that the series quoted sources out of context,
misidentified documents, was factually in error and omitted
evidence in favor of Mr. Sprague, including, in one article,
his own denial. At the second trial, attorneys for Mr.
Sprague introduced some of Mr. Walter's tape-recorded
interviews for the stories, showing that he coaxed statements
damaging to Mr. Sprague from sources.
   The jury, however, was not permitted to see a state
attorney general's report published after the Inquirer series
that found that the police did not thoroughly investigate the
1963 homicide and raised questions about Mr. Sprague's role.
Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Charles P. Mirarchi ruled the
report inadmissible because Inquirer reporters and editors
did not rely on it for their series.
   In a prepared statement, Executive Editor Eugene L.
Roberts Jr. said the report was relevant and complained that
the judge excluded much of the newspaper's defense from the
trial. Judge Mirarchi, he noted, was the subject of a 1983
inquiry by the paper into nepotism in Philadelphia courts.
   Mr. Sprague said the damages reflected the jury's outrage
at the abuse of power by the media. He criticized the paper
for not covering its own trial.

   EX-CITIBANK OFFICER convicted of stealing $25 million in
stock from vault.
   A federal jury in Manhattan convicted Mario Rios Pinochet,
formerly a Citibank vice president, of embezzling five bearer
securities valued at $5 million each. He also was found
guilty of interstate transportation of four of the five
securities and of trying to sell the stock through a
PaineWebber Inc. broker. The fifth security hasn't been
found.
   Mr. Pinochet was in charge of safeguarding assets at
Citibank, a unit of Citicorp. He is accused of stealing the
securities Jan. 25 while inspecting a vault in Manhattan as
part of an effort to improve Citibank's securities
procedures. Two days later, Mr. Pinochet turned the four
securities over to a broker, who then discovered that
Citibank had reported the stocks missing. Mr. Pinochet was
fired after he was arrested Feb. 1.
   Mr. Pinochet's attorney, James F. Gill, said he plans to
appeal. Citibank officials couldn't be reached for comment.

   SHAH OF IRAN'S SON files suit over family investments.
   Reza Pahlavi, son of the late shah and heir-in-exile to
Iran's Peacock Throne, filed suit in Virginia state court
against Ahmad Ali Massoud Ansari, who until last year managed
the Pahlavi family's money in the U.S.
   The complaint alleges that Mr. Ansari improperly placed
liens on Mr. Pahlavi's $3.1 million residence in McLean, Va.
It also asks for a full accounting of all funds entrusted to
Mr. Ansari. The total is estimated at more than $20 million,
according to Mr. Ansari's lawyer Richard Tomar, a partner in
the Washington firm of Margolius, Mallios, Davis, Rider &amp;
Tomar.
   Mr. Tomar said the liens were necessary to generate the
cash needed to maintain the Pahlavi family's investments. He
said Mr. Ansari is willing to provide an accounting of the
money, but "it's complicated. It was a lot of money over a
long period of time. We're, in fact, surprised that he would
want to make public all of his expenditures." He declined to
elaborate.
   Mr. Pahlavi's attorney, Thomas Cawley of Hunton &amp;
Williams, declined to confirm the amount of money involved.
He said that the suit, which was previously filed in federal
court and then withdrawn, was filed in Virginia court for
jurisdictional reasons on Wednesday. Mr. Pahlavi's case faced
potential jurisdictional obstacles in federal court because
Mr. Pahlavi would not declare himself to be a citizen of any
country.
   Asked whether Mr. Pahlavi is a citizen of Iran, Mr. Cawley
replied, "He is not a citizen of the United States."

   COPYRIGHT LAW doesn't protect analysis of historical
events, court rules.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago last week upheld a
lower court's dismissal of a $10.5 million lawsuit filed by
Chicago author Jay Robert Nash. It was the first time that
the appeals court had clearly ruled that copyright law does
not protect historical analysis, said Paula Litt, a Chicago
lawyer who represented defendants CBS Inc., MCA Inc.,
Universal City Studios Inc., and the writers and producers of
the television series "Simon and Simon."
   Mr. Nash had alleged that a "Simon and Simon" episode
violated his copyright of several books about John Dillinger,
former Public Enemy No. 1, who was killed by FBI agents in
1934 as he emerged from the Biograph Theater in Chicago.
   In his books, Mr. Nash argued that Mr. Dillinger did not
die at the Biograph. Instead, he maintained that Mr.
Dillinger learned about the FBI trap, sent a small-time
hoodlum to the theater in his place, and then retired to the
West Coast.
   In the "Simon and Simon" episode, private detectives Rick
and A.J. Simon investigate the murder of a retired FBI agent
who believed Mr. Dillinger did not die at the Biograph.
   The appeals court ruled that the TV show had used Mr.
Nash's work as a source for the episode. But the court ruled
that the producers of "Simon and Simon" did not violate Mr.
Nash's copyright. The panel said the copyright law protects
an author's words and presentation, not the historical event.
"The first person to conclude that Dillinger survived does
not get dibs on history. If Dillinger survived, that fact is
available to all," the court wrote.
   E. Leonard Rubin, a Chicago lawyer representing Mr. Nash,
said he felt the court's decision was too broad and could
have serious implications for other authors. "Copyright law
says you can't protect facts. But without an exhumation of
Dillinger's body, it's difficult to tell whether Mr. Nash's
supposition is theory or fact. Theories should be protected
or else there's not a lot of incentive to spend time
researching," said Mr. Rubin.
   He said his client has not decided whether to appeal.

   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT settles voting rights suit in New
Mexico.
   The suit was brought on behalf of Pueblo and Navajo
Indians against the state of New Mexico and Sandoval County.
According to the suit, the native Americans were denied full
access to voter information under the Voting Rights Act's
bilingualism provisions.
   The Justice Department alleged that the state and county
failed to adequately provide voter information in the Native
American languages spoken by the tribes. The voting law
requires that this information be provided orally to American
Indians because their languages are historically unwritten.
   Under the settlement, voter information will be provided
through radio announcements and other nonwritten means by a
full-time language coordinator who speaks Keres, the primary
Pueblo language of that area, and a second language
coordinator who speaks Navajo, who will be hired for nine
months prior to any general election. The state also will be
required to provide several officials to assist in the
bilingual program.
   Herman Agoyo, chairman of the All-Indian Pueblo Council, a
confederation of 19 New Mexico pueblos, said the settlement
will "open the door to more participation by the Indian
people in the voting process."

   ON THE STAND: Former Ashland Oil Chairman Orin Atkins took
the witness stand in a case involving the sale of company
secrets to Iran. Mr. Atkins, who pleaded guilty last year for
his role in the scheme, is testifying against Charles
Barnett, a Florida lawyer. Mr. Barnett is accused of helping
Mr. Atkins arrange the sale of the documents, which Iran
planned to use in a suit against Ashland. In federal court in
Manhattan, a jury was shown a secretly made videotape in
which Mr. Atkins said he was having financial difficulties
and told an associate to "make the best deal you can." He
also referred to Mr. Barnett's work on the negotiations,
which Mr. Barnett's attorney has described as legitimate and
legal.
