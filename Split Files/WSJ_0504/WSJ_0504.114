   Crude oil prices skidded, even as OPEC oil ministers were
saying the pact they struck yesterday would prop up prices.
   At an emergency meeting of the group's monitoring
committee -- a parley that lasted less than two days --
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed to cut total production by 1.4 million barrels a day.
But the reduction, which was supposed to send positive
signals to the market, instead caused the futures price of
crude for June delivery to tumble by 69 cents a barrel.
Gasoline and heating oil prices retreated as well.

   Market participants were somewhat disappointed that OPEC
ministers didn't accomplish anything more than reducing
output back to the official quota level of 22.08 million
barrels a day established at last November's meeting. By
OPEC's own reckoning, current demand for its oil is less than
21 million barrels daily.
   In addition, inventories world-wide are burgeoning and
storage facilities are loaded to the brim, industry officials
say.
   "There was a reluctance to sell before the meeting in case
OPEC did something unexpected,' said James Fiedler, vice
president for energy brokering at E.D.&amp; F. Man International
Futures Inc. "There was always the possibility that OPEC
would pull a rabbit out of its hat," as it has in the past.
   Oil prices had initially rallied somewhat on news of the
OPEC pricing pact. Particularly positive were reports that
the United Arab Emirates, a flagrant violator of its OPEC
quota of about one million barrels daily, had agreed to slash
output by 200,000 barrels a day. Industry experts as well as
OPEC officials had pegged current UAE production at 1.9
million barrels daily.
   Howver, after the agreement had been struck, UAE Oil
Minister Mana Otaiba said that production by the Emirates
actually stood at 2.1 million. "In just one sentence, Otaiba
torpedoed the whole meeting," said Peter Gignoux, director of
Shearson Lehman Hutton's energy desk in London. "He was
producing more than anyone, including OPEC, thought he was."
   Industry officials and traders say they have little faith
that the cartel's members will actually rein in production.
But OPEC ministers, cognizant of the doubts, say that
yesterday's price decline is only temporary -- prices will
rise gradually in the weeks ahead as they honor their
agreement.
   Also depressing oil prices was a report issued by the U.S.
Energy Department Wednesday night. The agency estimated that
crude oil stocks in the U.S. increased by 4.2 million barrels
in the week ended April 27. The American Petroleum Institute
had reported Tuesday that crude stocks during that period
declined.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices eased. The May contract was off
1.10 cents an ounce to $1.2020. July declined 0.55 cent an
ounce to $1.1160. As a result, the May premium over July was
reduced 0.55 cent to 8.60 cents. The price decline didn't
reflect any change in the current supply tightness, but
instead was influenced by softness in London caused by a
London Metal Exchange examination of recent trading there,
according to William O'Neill, vice president of research for
Elders Futures Inc., New York. The Metal Exchange asked all
brokers to turn their trading cards over to the exchange by 6
a.m. EDT today, according to Mr. O'Neill; he said the
exchange was looking into any trading beyond the bounds of
rules that might have affected the premium of the cash
position price over that of the three-months' delivery. On
Tuesday, that premium widened sharply and then was reduced on
Wednesday, Mr. O'Neill noted. In Peru, mine and smelter
workers of Southern Peru Copper Corp. remained on strike
despite an order Wednesday signed by the Peruvian President
Alan Garcia ordering them back to work by yesterday. The
National Federation of Mine Workers said that a meeting of
the member unions took place yesterday and that the result of
the talks would be announced at a news conference today. A
New York spokesman for the company confirmed yesterday's
union meeting had taken place and that today's union news
conference was scheduled, but said that Southern Peru had
repeated that the federation didn't represent the five unions
involved in the strike.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. June delivery gold
was up $1.70 an ounce to $373.70. July silver edged up 0.8
cent an ounce to $5.0730. July platinum advanced $2.70 an
ounce to $483.20. Some support for gold came from a Knight
Ridder report that the International Monetary Fund wouldn't
sell gold for the next two to three years to make up for
defaults on loans by some member nations. The gold these
nations have contributed to the IMF as part of their
membership will, instead, be used as collateral to back loans
to these nations, according to the report. This alleviated
fears of gold sales by the IMF, as had been proposed by the
U.S., an analyst said. There was also growing concern over
the increasingly unstable political situation in South Africa
and the possibility of violence, the analyst said. The South
African Bureau of Mines' latest report indicated gold
production in that country was up last month, but slightly
lower for the first quarter than last year. Gold output
during March amounted to 47,560 kilograms, up 4% from the
45,724 kilograms in February but below the 48,733 kilograms
of March 1989. For the first quarter, gold production
amounted to 148,226 kilograms, down 1% from the 150,133
kilograms a year earlier. A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed lower on profit-taking
following Wednesday's rally. The decline was also in response
to crop estimates released by a widely followed
futures-research concern, Sparks Commodities Inc., in
Memphis, Tenn. Soybean futures for July delivery dropped 7.75
cents a bushel to close at $6.44 following the release of
Sparks's estimate of the Brazil soybean crop at 19.5 million
metric tons -- higher than many other private estimates,
futures analysts said. Heavy rains across many Brazilian
growing regions in recent weeks, while farmers were trying to
harvest their soybeans, had led many analysts to predict a
reduction in the Brazilian crop. Wheat futures prices had
been higher early in the trading session on worries that
heavy rains in Texas and Oklahoma winter-wheat growing
regions had damaged the crop. Continued expectations for
imminent export orders also supported prices. But July wheat
futures finished the session down 0.75 cent at $3.4675 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly in response to
Sparks's estimate of a bumper wheat crop this year. Sparks,
which doesn't comment on its estimates, said the winter-wheat
crop would total 2.05 billion bushels and that the U.S.'s
total wheat crop would reach 2.72 billion bushels -- both
figures being higher than those of many other analysts. Corn
futures prices, influenced by the action in the adjoining
futures pits, dropped two cents a bushel for July delivery to
close at $2.87.
