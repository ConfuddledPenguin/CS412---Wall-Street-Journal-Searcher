   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks extended their winning
streak, but traders cautioned the market might be due for
some profit-taking next week, if not today.
   Technology stocks continued to fuel the OTC market. The
Nasdaq 100 index of large industrial issues, which includes
some large computer stocks, gained 0.76%, again outpacing the
broader Nasdaq Composite Index gain of 0.4%, or 1.86, to
425.44. Advancing shares continued to lead declining stocks,
979 to 848, while 94 issues climbed to new highs and 89 hit
new lows. Volume was 160.9 million shares, up from 143.2
million.

   "The market still looks like a million bucks to me," said
E. E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc.
of New York. But he added, "That doesn't mean I won't take
some profits." Mr. Geduld said he saw increasing
institutional demand for selective stocks across all industry
groups.
   Dick Holden, manager of the OTC department at Alex. Brown
&amp; Sons, Baltimore, said the continuing strength in technology
shares surprised him, adding that he saw resilience in the
group even as the market faded somewhat at the end of the
day.
   Among other issues, Mr. Holden pointed out that the
improving bond market helped some interest-sensitive stocks.
The Nasdaq insurance index closed up 0.3%. The index of 100
Nasdaq financial shares and a smaller-company financial index
both rose slightly.
   While the market's bias was on the demand side, Mr. Holden
added, "It's not so aggressive that you get the sense this
market is going through the roof. It's a good mix right now."
   Acquisition news fueled some of the day's leaders. Subaru
of America sped ahead to 8, up 1 5/8, after Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. of Japan sweetened a $6-a-share bid for
shares of the Cherry Hill, N.J., automaker that it doesn't
already own. Fuji offered a minimum cash payment of $8.50 a
share.
   SHL Systemhouse jumped 3/4 to 5 1/4 after the Canadian
developer of computer-based information systems said it's
seeking a buyer.
   Oracle Systems continued to trade heavily, closing up 1
3/8 at 17 1/4 after Jeffrey L. Walker, chief financial
officer, raised the company's estimate for fourth-quarter
revenues, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. Mr. Walker told investors at a Hambrecht &amp; Quist
technology conference in San Francisco that the Belmont,
Calif., maker of data base software now expects revenue for
the fourth quarter ending May 31 of $330 million to $355
milion, up from a previous estimate of $300 million to $320
million.
   An initial public offering of more than 2.5 million shares
of Dynasty Classics, a Carson, Calif., maker and distributor
of lighting fixtures, was well received. Priced at 11 1/4 in
an underwriting led by Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers,
Dynasty shares closed up 1 at 12 1/4 on 2.1 million shares.
   Liqui-Box climbed 5 1/2 to 59 after the Worthington, Ohio,
packaging-materials concern posted net income for the first
quarter ended March 31 of 96 cents a share, up from 71 cents
a year earlier. The company said its sales increase reflects
its acquisition last year of another packaging materials
firm, B-Bar-B of New Albany, Ind.
   Adaptec rebounded 2 to 18 7/8 after the Milpitas, Calif.,
maker of computer data flow systems reported net income for
the fourth quarter ended March 31 of 43 cents a share, up
from 10 cents a year earlier. Mr. Holden explained that some
investors had been concerned about the earnings, but said
they "came in smack dab on target."
   Other active technology stocks were Intel, up 1/8 at 1
3/8, Seagate Technology, up 1/4 at 12 5/8, Microsoft, up 3/4
at 59 and Apple Computer, up 1/4 at 40.
   Hologic spurted 1 1/4 to 21 1/2 after the newly public
developer of X-ray systems reported net income for the second
quarter of 17 cents a share, up from 13 cents a year earlier.
The Waltham, Mass., company made an initial public offering
March 1 at $14 a share.
   Enstar gained 3/8 to 2 1/2 after the financial-services
concern reported net income for the first quarter ended March
31 of 14 cents a share compared with a year-earlier loss from
continuing operations of seven cents a share.
   Shares of Respironics, a Monroeville, Pa., maker of
medical respiratory products, surged 4 1/4 to 24 after the
company reported Wednesday that net income for the third
quarter ended March 31 of 33 cents a share, up from 15 cents
a year earlier.
   Gantos extended its slide, falling 1/4 to 9 1/4. Citing
disappointing sales, the Grand Rapids, Mich., specialty
retailer estimated a loss for the first quarter ending May 5
of 15 to 20 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net
income of 20 cents a share.
   Campeau fell 7/8 to 1 1/2 after the company's troubled
Federated Department Stores unit said it won't sell its
Bloomingdale's department store division.
