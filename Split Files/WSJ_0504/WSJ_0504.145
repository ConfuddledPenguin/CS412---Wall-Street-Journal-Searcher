   Belgian financier Albert Frere is expected to be named
today as chairman of Petrofina S.A., the big Belgian oil
company.
   Mr. Frere will succeed Jean-Pierre Amory, who is retiring.
It is a job Mr. Frere has been pursuing for more than a
decade, associates say.

   While Mr. Frere has clearly reached the top, however, he
may have to keep striving to maintain his prestige and power.
For one thing, investment analysts say, he faces a big
challenge in trying to improve the mediocre performance of
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A., or GBL, the holding company he
heads. GBL, which is Petrofina's biggest shareholder, is
still recovering from the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc., in which the Belgian firm had a stake of about
25%.
   To keep his grip on GBL, meanwhile, Mr. Frere will need to
remain on good terms with another reclusive and strong-willed
tycoon, Paul Desmarais Sr., chairman of Power Corp. of
Canada. The families of Messrs. Frere and Desmarais recently
announced that they jointly control Pargesa Holding S.A., a
Geneva holding company that holds big stakes in GBL and
Petrofina and is thus the key to Mr. Frere's empire.
