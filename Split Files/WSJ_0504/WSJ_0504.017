   NEW YORK -- Colt Industries Inc. said it changed its name
to Coltec Industries Inc., effective yesterday, reflecting
the company's sale of its firearms business March 22, a
spokesman said.
   Excluding the firearms business, which accounted for only
6% of the company's $1.61 billion in sales last year, Coltec
now has businesses in aerospace, automotive and other
industrial products.

   Coltec currently is owned by Colt Holdings Inc., which
took Colt Industries private in June 1988.
