   Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. said that because of aggressive
efforts to hold its share of the softening California housing
market, net income for the second quarter ending May 31 isn't
expected to match last year's $20 million, or 57 cents a
share.
   In an interview after the annual meeting, Bruce Karatz,
president and chief executive officer, said he couldn't
predict how sharply earnings might fall in the current
period. Noting new strength in the past eight weeks in
California, which accounts for 60% of Kaufman &amp; Broad's
business, he said he also couldn't say yet how second-quarter
revenue will compare with last year's $246 million.

   The Los Angeles-based company, which reported a 15% rise
in first-quarter net income to $13.3 million, or 40 cents a
share, previously had forecast annual net income below last
year's record $81.4 million, or $2.44 a share, because of the
impact of the company's marketing actions on profit margins.
But Mr. Karatz said after the meeting that profit still would
exceed the $48 million, or $1.76 a share, that the home
builder earned in the year that ended Nov. 30, 1988. Revenue
this year will rise from last year's $1.27 billion, he said.
