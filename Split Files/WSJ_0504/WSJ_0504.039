   THE FED FEARS it may soon have to start tightening credit
again.
   Last year's round of tightening slowed the economy, but
frustrated officials acknowledge that it seems to have done
little to control inflation. Even if one-time distortions are
removed, core inflation is still running at a 4.5% to 5%
annual pace -- the same or slightly higher than when the Fed
started clamping down.

   Administration officials seem confident the Fed won't
raise rates before its May 15 meeting. But a move could come
soon afterward: Regional Presidents Parry and Hoskins are
leading the charge, and usually dovish Vice Chairman Johnson
fears that the recent rise in long-term bond rates could
signal coming inflation.
   One former Fed official notes a new round of tightening
could spark a recession just when the White House least wants
it -- before the 1992 election.
                                                                                                       

   NAVAL MANEUVERS: The U.S. fleet faces major budget
cutbacks.
   Defense chief Cheney talks of eventually cutting the Navy
to less than 500 vessels. One likely casualty: the Reagan
administration's $1 billion plan for "home ports" in several
states. The Pentagon's internal hit list of potential base
closings includes some of the designated ports.
   Texas Sen. Bentsen and other Southern lawmakers vow to
wage a major battle to save ports in their region, citing
hefty investments already made by state and local
governments. But Secretary Cheney goes out of his way to say
the lawmakers never received "absolute assurances" that
construction would proceed.
                                                                                                       

   A SOVIET STALL is likely at tomorrow's German unity talks.
   U.S. analysts expect the Soviets to insist on
"synchronizing" unification with decisions on European
security, especially the issue of Berlin's NATO membership.
But Baker and his German, British and French colleagues will
counter that the only issues to be taken up now are canceling
the World War II allies' rights in Germany and guaranteeing
Poland's border.
   They will offer to discuss other Soviet concerns only at
arms talks that wouldn't hold up unification. To help
Gorbachev save face, though, they will offer to bar Germany
from building nuclear weapons and to cut the size of its
army. Bush's call yesterday for quicker talks on nuclear
weapons is also aimed at easing Soviet fears.
   U.S. officials say Gorbachev may act tough now to appease
his hard-liners but badly wants German trade and investment
and can't afford to stall forever.
                                                                                                       

   CRANSTON'S CONFIDENCE in his 1992 Senate re-election
prospects isn't shared by fellow California Democrats.
Powerful state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown says that while
Cranston -- tarred by the Keating scandal -- could win
renomination in a crowded primary field, "he could lose the
general election against a dead Republican."
                                                                                                       

   CONSERVATIVES COMPLAIN that Sununu seemed to back off from
Bush's pledge to veto the child-care bill in a White House
session with evangelicals and others last week. But White
House aides say the conservatives read too much into the
staff chief's comments; they don't expect Congress to give
the president a bill he will sign.
                                                                                                       

   RHETORICAL HIGH: In an anti-drug speech, Attorney General
Thornburgh yearns for an America "where `pot' once again
means a useful cooking utensil, where `crack' is the sound of
a baseball hitting a bat, where `grass' is something to mow,
not to smoke, and where `heroin(e)' means a Helen Keller, a
Christa McAuliffe, a Sandra Day O'Connor and, yes, a Barbara
Bush."
                                                                                                       

   BRADY'S CLOUT in economic policy making is likely to be
enhanced by the imminent appointment of Edith Holiday to be
assistant to the president for Cabinet affairs, where she
will oversee the powerful Economic Policy Council. Holiday, a
longtime aide to the Treasury secretary, is currently his
department's general counsel.
                                                                                                       

   PARTISAN PROPOSALS on campaign-finance reform bring accord
little closer.
   With Senate Democrats and Republicans backing vastly
different bills, Majority Leader Mitchell and Minority Leader
Robert Dole are expected to hold closed-door talks next week
in search of a compromise. But many lawmakers in both parties
believe that such talks are doomed -- and wouldn't be unhappy
to see no reform at all this year, as long as their party
isn't blamed for killing it.
   Especially unhappy are the big crop of Senate Democrats up
in 1992, who want special exemptions from new rules, and the
Democratic National Committee, which relies heavily on "soft
money" contributions that would be abolished. A filibuster by
Republicans or a Bush veto are likely if the Democrats insist
on public funding and spending ceilings.
   In the House, Majority Leader Gephardt brings back widely
respected, retired Rules Chairman Bolling to work on reform
legislation.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: The Ikea home-furnishings chain advertises
"Nancy Reagan Style at Barbara Bush Prices." . . . After a
Wall Street Journal story mentioned that Iowa gubernatorial
contender Donald Avenson doesn't use seat belts, he promises
to buckle up from now on and declares: "I am not a scofflaw."
. . . Former Rep. Mezvinsky announces his candidacy for
Pennsylvania lieutenant governor yesterday -- for a primary
to be held May 15. He calls the brevity of his "300-hour
race" a gift to the voters.
