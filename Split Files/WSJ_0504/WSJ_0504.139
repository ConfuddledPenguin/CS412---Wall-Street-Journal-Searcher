   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, convinced that the
major political danger it faces is an economy crippled by
rising interest rates, is exploring a deficit-reduction deal
with Congress more intensely than ever before.
   To hasten the start of negotiations, President Bush
invited the majority and minority leaders of both houses to
meet with him at the White House Sunday afternoon. "What we
have to do is start talking process, and how we go forward,"
Mr. Bush said yesterday.

   The White House clearly hopes Sunday's huddle will pave
the way for talks on a bipartisan pact to slash the budget
deficit and reshape the federal budget process. But top
congressional Democrats remain wary, and the odds of enacting
a package of big spending cuts and, especially, significant
tax increases -- essential to any accord -- in this election
year are still no better than even.
   The president's invitation caps weeks of intense wooing of
Congress by Budget Director Richard Darman, among others.
With White House blessing, two Democratic insiders -- power
lawyer Robert Strauss and former Ohio congressman Thomas
Ashley -- are working behind the scenes. The two men have
talked privately with Mr. Bush about the deficit. Though both
insist they aren't presidential emissaries, they have been
telling key congressmen that the time for a budget summit is
at hand.
   "I've been telling both sides that it's time to come to
the table," says Mr. Ashley, a friend of the president and
now head of a bank trade association. "Without carrying
messages, I can at least give a careful description of the
interests of the various parties." Mr. Strauss has been doing
the same, cornering Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.) at a recent black-tie dinner to try to
persuade him that the White House is sincerely ready to
bargain.
   Sen. Sasser isn't convinced. "I see no real evidence that
they're interested," he said yesterday. "If they're
interested in another conspiracy to get by with a slideby
budget, I'm not interested."
   Even if the two sides are ready to bargain, the political
obstacles are high. "You face very tough choices," House
Budget Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) says. "The politics
have prevented these choices from being made. The politics
are still the same."
   Democrats, who have excoriated Mr. Bush for proposing
steep cutbacks in Medicare, farm-subsidies and other
entitlements, would almost certainly have to swallow such
entitlement cutbacks -- and might even have to agree to trim
Social Security.
   In return, Democrats would insist that Mr. Bush eat the
"no new taxes" pledge that has been so politically potent.
And their price for accepting Mr. Bush's cut in capital-gains
tax rates, Democrats say, would be an increase in the top
marginal tax rate for the richest Americans, which many
Republicans are certain to oppose. (The richest taxpayers now
pay a top rate of 28%, even though many less-wealthy
taxpayers face a 33% top rate.) The White House is still
resistant. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are toying with a
compromise -- which would neither gain nor lose revenue --
that would set the top rate at 31%, a tax cut for those now
paying 33% and a tax increase for those paying 28%.
   Despite all these obstacles, administration offficials
figure congressional Democrats may be receptive to talks now
that the Senate Budget Committee and the full House have each
agreed on their own budget plans. Congressional Democrats say
their progress is also motivating the White House. "We have
sent a signal to the White House that instead of the process
collapsing, it was going forward," says Rep. Panetta.
   To get talks going, the two budget chairmen say, the
president himself must persuade Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley that he is
willing to share the blame for raising taxes and cutting
spending. "You can't get into a situation where one side
accuses the other of putting something on the table," Rep.
Panetta stresses.
   The economic fundamentals also are pushing the parties
toward each other. "The deficit projections are such that
they have the Congress gasping a little bit, and the
administration, too," Mr. Ashley says. Just three months ago,
Mr. Darman said a deficit-reduction package of $35.6 billion
would avoid triggering across-the-board budget cuts this fall
under the Gramm-Rudman law. With federal revenues falling
short of projections and interest rates rising, he now says
it will take $45 billion or maybe even $55 billion.
   White House officials also fear that rising interest rates
world-wide, caused largely by the resuscitation of Eastern
Europe, also threaten to cut short the economic expansion on
which Mr. Bush's re-election hopes rest. "Japanese capital
available for investment here may be contracting somewhat,"
Mr. Darman said in a speech at Harvard this week. "European
capital is looking more Eastward and inward. U.S. borrowing
for the S&amp;L (savings &amp; loan) mess is temporarily soaring."
The administration figures the only move it can make to bring
down interest rates is to reduce the government's appetite
for debt.
   Last year's summit between the administration and
congressional leaders is now widely viewed, both in the White
House and on Capitol Hill, as a model to avoid. It
accomplished little significant deficit-reduction and left a
bitter aftertaste in Congress. If Sunday's meeting leads to a
fullfledged summit, all parties agree, this one should
include the chairmen of the powerful tax-writing and
appropriations committees to assure that the resulting
agreement is enacted.
   The administration and many in Congress also want to use
any bipartisan talks to change the federal budgeting process.
Democrats, stung by charges that they are raiding the Social
Security trust fund to reduce the deficit, want to alter
budgetary accounting for Social Security. Mr. Darman wants to
close loopholes in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law,
among other changes to restrain growth in federal spending.
   "Knowing what I know," he told his Harvard audience, "I
can't help whistling the Arlo Guthrie song . . . `You can get
anything that you want at Alice's Restaurant.' This really
should not be what comes to an OMB (Office of Management and
Budget) Director's mind as he walks to work."
