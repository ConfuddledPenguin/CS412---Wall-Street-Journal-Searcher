   Interest rates are on the rise again, but home buyers
shopping for a loan this spring may be in for a pleasant
surprise: Mortgage rates are still lower than they were a
year ago.
   Unfortunately, that won't make choosing the right mortgage
less of a chore for most people. In addition to figuring out
what they can afford, home buyers have to weigh the amount of
risk they're willing to tolerate, where they are in their
lives and careers and how long they plan to stay in the new
home.
   Lenders don't make it any easier. Besides the basic choice
between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, they are
offering a variety of permutations -- including biweekly
payments, 15-year mortgages and something new called the
"seven-year two-step."
   But choosing a mortgage doesn't have to be a bewildering
experience, if you focus clearly on your own needs and the
choices available. "It's like buying a car," says Arthur D.
Ringwald, executive vice president of Sears Mortgage Corp., a
unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. "You buy a sports car for one
purpose, a pickup truck for another and a four-door sedan for
yet something else."
   Here, with some pointers from financial professionals, is
a look at the principal options:
                                                                                                       

   Adjustable-Rate Mortgages. Called ARMs for short,
adjustable-rate mortgages generally offer lower initial rates
than fixed-rate home loans. But the rate and the monthly
payment move up and down, in line with an index tied to
short-term interest rates.
   That makes ARMs particularly popular among young people
who expect their incomes to grow enough to cover potential
increases in monthly payments and among those who don't
expect to remain in the same home more than a few years. "The
ARM buys you a bigger buying opportunity" because of the
lower introductory rate, says Anthony Neal, a senior vice
president of Central Trust Co. in Cincinnati.
   At the same time, ARMs can be risky. "What looks like a
very affordable situation may not look so good after a year,"
says Mr. Neal. The monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage,
for instance, would rise from $768.92 to $914.74 if the
interest rate went from 8.5% to 10.5%.
   For an ARM to be worth the risk, many financial
professionals say, the initial rate should be at least two
percentage points lower than the fixed rate. With fixed-rate
mortgages currently at about 10.6% and the average initial
rate on ARMs at about 8.5%, the spread is a bit wider than
two percentage points.
   Typically, the interest-rate adjustment is made every six
months, annually or once every three years. While three-year
adjustables often are considered more desirable because they
are more predictable, a shorter adjustment period looks a lot
better when interest rates are falling.
   On six-month and one-year ARMs, the interest rate can
usually rise or fall a total of two percentage points a year,
and five or six percentage points over the life of the loan.
   Lenders in the East and Midwest tend to favor an index
based on Treasury securities, often the one-year T-bill,
while the monthly cost-of-funds index issued by the Federal
Home Loan Bank of San Francisco is more common in western
states. A specified amount, usually 1.5 to 2.5 percentage
points, is added to the index to determine the mortgage rate.
   Some adjustable-rate mortgages are convertible into
fixed-rate loans during a specific period, usually between
the second and fifth year.
   One thing to avoid: ARMs that provide for "negative
amortization." That's when a lender limits increases in a
borrower's monthly payments in such a way that they aren't
sufficient to cover the principal and interest actually being
charged, and the difference is added to the balance of the
loan. The homeowner can end up owing more than the original
mortgage.
                                                                                                       

   Fixed-Rate Mortgages. These are generally considered a
good choice for people who plan to remain in a home for a
while. They know what their payments will be and can budget
for the long term, making it possible to put aside money for
children's education, for instance, or for a regular
investment program.
   "It takes all of the uncertainty out," says Mr. Ringwald
of Sears Mortgage. "As time goes on, the mortgage payment
becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of income. The
payments will get easier and easier to make and you'll get
more and more solvent."
   But the price for that certainty is a higher monthly
payment to start, which may make it harder for some people to
qualify. Lenders typically require that housing expenses,
including real estate taxes and monthly maintenance payments
on a cooperative apartment or condominium, not exceed 28% of
the homeowner's gross income.
   The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the stalwart of the
industry, probably the kind your parents had and maybe even
your grandparents had. The payments are predictable, and
equity builds up steadily.
   For those with more disposable income, there's the 15-year
mortgage. In return for slightly higher payments, the home is
paid off in half the time. Timothy Chase, a financial planner
with Baltimore accountants Wolpert, Smullian &amp; Blumenthal,
says it's the mortgage of choice for people nearing
retirement. "Nobody wants to be making mortgage payments when
they're 70 years old," he says.
   Because a borrower can often get a slightly lower rate on
a 15-year mortgage, the difference in monthly payments is
smaller than might be expected. On a $150,000 mortgage, for
instance, homeowners would pay $1,372.11 on a 10.5% 30-year
mortgage. Assuming they could get 10.25% on a 15-year loan,
the monthly payment would be $1,634.94. With the 15-year
mortgage, they'd also save almost $200,000 in interest.
   An alternative for people who want to pay off their
mortgage faster is biweekly payments. The biweekly payments
are half what a monthly payment would be, but there's the
equivalent of one extra monthly payment a year, so equity
builds up more quickly. The mortgage can be paid off in 18 to
20 years, at a considerable savings of interest.
                                                                                                       

   Seven-Year Two-Step. No, this isn't that hot new dance
from Brazil. It's a mortgage that offers a fixed monthly
payment for the first seven years at a rate that's usually a
quarter to half a percentage point lower than the rate on a
30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The rate is adjusted to market
levels after seven years.
   "Young buyers who are pretty sure they're going to move
might as well take advantage of the lower rate," says Warren
Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers
Association. On a $150,000 loan, half a percentage point
means more than $50 a month. The risk, however, is that if
the homeowner doesn't move, he or she may find rates
considerably higher in seven years.
