   EL PASO, Texas -- William F. Farah, who was removed as
chairman of Farah Inc. last week, sued the company, Farah
directors and top officers to prevent them from cutting him
off from the clothing manufacturer he helped manage for 53
years.
   Mr. Farah, a company director and the company's largest
stockholder with one million shares, or about a 15% stake, is
asking an El Paso county court for a temporary restraining
order to keep other board members and Farah's top management
from restricting his role as a board member and company
consultant.

   Calling his fellow board members "spiteful conspirators"
who want to destroy him financially, Mr. Farah charges that
board members have threatened to terminate his three-year
consulting services contract. That contract, which has two
years remaining, pays him an annual fee of $365,000 and
provides Mr. Farah with an office and secretary. According to
a letter attached to the lawsuit, the board unanimously
decided at a March 13 meeting that Mr. Farah and his
secretary would vacate the premises by May 1.
   Mr. Farah resigned as president and chief executive
officer of the company last year and was succeeded by Richard
C. Allender.
   Mr. Farah wasn't available for comment yesterday.
   Last week, the board removed Mr. Farah as chairman after
he apparently wrote letters to directors urging them to
either replace current management or resign. Mr. Farah is
said to be unhappy with the direction of the company. He was
succeeded by Thomas G. Wyman, a recently elected board member
who has a 5% stake in Farah.
   In an interview conducted before the suit was filed, Mr.
Allender declined to discuss the company's relationship with
Mr. Farah. But when asked about Mr. Farah's pending lawsuit,
Mr. Allender said: "I can't afford to be concerned about what
Willie {Mr. Farah} may or may not do. I have a business to
run."
   According to the lawsuit, Messrs. Allender and Wyman
interpreted Mr. Farah's consulting contract to mean that Mr.
Farah should provide advice only when Mr. Allender requests
it.
   In a letter to Mr. Allender filed with court documents,
Mr. Farah said he would be "derelict in my duty if, as you
suggest, I limit my efforts, inquiries and activities to mere
attendance of board meetings."
