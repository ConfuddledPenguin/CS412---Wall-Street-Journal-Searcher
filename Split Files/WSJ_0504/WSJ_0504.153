   Troubled Subaru of America Inc. will add at least $61
million to Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.'s $147 million bid for
the 50.4% stake of Subaru it doesn't already own.
   The addition, from the proposed sale of Subaru's
auto-lease portfolio, should help wrap up the deal, which
Fuji proposed in January. Some Subaru shareholders had
complained about the initial price, because it didn't reflect
much of a premium on Subaru stock. Some of the holders filed
lawsuits opposing the terms of the takeover.

   Under the unusual definitive agreement, Tokyo-based Fuji
will stick to its original $6 a share offer for full control
of the U.S. company that sells cars Fuji builds. But Subaru
will add to the offer a minimum of $2.50 a share.
   Subaru officials said they don't have a buyer lined up for
the leases, but set the $61 million minimum value on the
advice of their investment bankers.
   In a joint announcement with Subaru, Toshihiro Tajima,
chairman and president of Fuji, said, "Our decision to
increase our offer reflects the desire by Fuji Heavy to
conclude this transaction."
   The deal, which the companies expect to complete in the
third quarter of 1990, illustrates a consolidation among
Japanese auto makers smaller than Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan
Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co.
   The larger Japanese car and truck companies are
increasingly pressuring their smaller competitors for sales
and market share. Partly in reaction to this, the smaller
companies are looking for more help from overseas partners
and even from some of their larger domestic competitors.
   Fuji is a prime example. About three months after Fuji
launched its offer for Subaru, Mr. Tajima announced he would
step down from Fuji's top jobs in favor of Isamu Kawai, a
former top executive with Nissan, Fuji's largest shareholder.
   The moves amount to a Nissan rescue of Fuji, which
estimated it would complete the year ended March 31 with an
operating loss of nearly 23 billion yen ($145.3 million).
That's seven times more than it forecast last fall.
   The management changes and Fuji's financial difficulties
added uncertainty to the Subaru offer Fuji launched in
mid-January. Subaru officials had already balked at the bid
because it offered a thin premium above the market value of
the stock. The potential class-action suit filed in
opposition to terms by some holders was settled as part of
the definitive agreement.
   "It was clear that shareholders and management weren't
ready to accept the lower initial price," said Scott Merlis,
an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "Throwing in
proceeds from the sale of the leasing operations was a clever
compromise in very tough negotiations."
   Other analysts said the $8.50 a share aggregate offer is
much higher than they expected for Subaru shares. The higher
offer pushed Subaru shares higher by $1.625, to close at $8
in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   Subaru hit its sales peak in 1986. But since then, sales
have rapidly deteriorated, forcing Subaru to ante up large
buyer and dealer incentives. Subaru's sales dropped 34%
between last year and 1986. The financial shock led to huge
losses in that period for Subaru, the only publicly traded
distributor of Japanese cars in the U.S.
   Fuji officials, with the full backing of Nissan, say they
expect to improve Subaru's performance and communications
between the U.S. and Japanese operations.
   "It's very, very important that we have clearer
coordination between product development and sales," said
Akira Soejima, a Fuji senior managing director in a telephone
interview. "We're now thinking of new products for the U.S.
market and we're trying hard to assist our 750 dealers all
over the U.S. market."
