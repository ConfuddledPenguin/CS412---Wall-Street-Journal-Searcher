   WASHINGTON -- The government scaled down its estimate of
the economy's growth in the first quarter to a 1.3% annual
rate, barely faster than the fourth quarter's limp pace.
   New information showed that business inventories,
particularly stocks of auto dealers, were considerably
slimmer during the three months than the government initially
believed. That led the Commerce Department to reduce its
estimate of the increase in the nation's real gross national
product -- the inflation-adjusted value of all the goods and
services produced -- from the 2.1% rate it calculated in an
advance report released last month.

   On the surface, the numbers suggest a shift to economic
anemia from slow but healthy growth. But because the downward
revision centered on business inventories, many analysts said
the picture wasn't quite that dark. In fact, many economists
believe a reduction in inventories is healthy during a time
of slow growth because it keeps stocks in line with softening
demand and diminishes the possibility of drastic cuts in
production.
   "The economy is just as strong as in the advance report,"
said Kermit Baker, director of economics at Cahners
Publishing in Newton, Mass., which puts out business
publications. "What it means fundamentally is manufacturers
weren't expecting as much strength and didn't produce as
much. When demand came in stronger, they took it out of
inventories."
   Real final sales, a gauge of demand in the economy, grew
4.1% in the first quarter, a quick pace and a shade stronger
than the initial estimate of 4%. That was much better than
the 1.1% gain in the fourth quarter.
   The department said after-tax corporate profits edged up
0.2% in the first quarter, to an annual rate of $157 billion.
That was a sharp slowdown from the 2.8% increase in the
fourth quarter but it was still better than the first three
quarters of 1989, when profits fell. The department will
revise its profits statistics next month when it makes a
third estimate of GNP.
   Even though the downward revision in first-quarter GNP
meant the economy barely improved from its meek 1.1% rate of
growth in the fourth quarter, the report showed personal
consumption, trade and fixed investment were all higher than
in the final three months of 1989.
   Although many economists -- as well as the financial
markets -- seemed to dismiss the revision because of its
concentration in inventories, Joseph Carson, senior economist
at Chemical Bank in New York argued, "To put all attention on
inventories is to ignore some fundamental deficiencies in the
economy."
   He, like many other economists, believes much of the
economy's expansion in the first quarter was helped by
temporary occurrences: mild weather contributed to a spurt in
construction, and the conclusion of a strike at Boeing Co. in
the fourth quarter resulted in a burst of aircraft production
in the first quarter. "So I think apart from those special
factors, growth in the first quarter was close to zero," Mr.
Carson said.
   Mr. Carson also noted that much of the reduction in
inventories was in the auto industry, which closed plants and
laid off thousands of workers during the first quarter to
trim bulging stocks.
   The department did push up its calculation of inflation in
the first quarter a bit. Its fixed weighted price index,
which measures the change in price of a fixed array of goods
and services in the GNP, grew at a 6.7% annual rate in the
first quarter instead of 6.5%, the new report said.
   That jump, following a 3.6% rate in the fourth quarter,
was the biggest since the fourth quarter of 1981. But most
analysts think the spike in prices was largely temporary,
driven by a jump in food and energy prices after a bitter
cold spell during the winter.
   The department didn't change its estimate of another price
gauge, the implicit price deflator, which reflects the change
in the mix of goods and services in the GNP. Prices by this
measure rose at a 5.7% annual rate, the steepest increase
since the third quarter of 1982.
   Also according to yesterday's report, profits from current
production rose 0.7% in the first quarter to a $287.8 billion
rate, after tumbling 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Net
corporate cash flow decreased 2.3% in the first quarter to a
$389.3 billion rate, compared with a 0.3% decline in the
fourth quarter.
