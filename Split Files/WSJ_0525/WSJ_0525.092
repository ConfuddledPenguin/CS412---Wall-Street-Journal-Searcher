   Grand Metropolitan PLC said it decided against selling its
Alpo Pet-foods unit because it couldn't find a buyer willing
to pay the price it sought.
   The London-based food, beverage and retailing company said
it received several bids for the Allentown, Pa., pet-food
maker, which has been on the block for three months. But it
was "unable to reach agreement as to the value of Alpo's
recently launched cat-food business."

   Industry analysts suggested that Grand Met may have had
inflated expectations about the value of the business, which
ranks sixth in the domestic pet-food industry, especially the
cat-food line. They speculated that Grand Met hoped to fetch
between $600 million and $700 million for the unit, which had
sales in excess of $400 million in the year ended Sept. 30.
   "Obviously, the bone of contention with potential buyers
was cat food," said Roger Spencer, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. "It hasn't been around long enough to build
up a sustained value."
   Alpo officials said Alpo's share of the cat-food market
has steadily increased since its introduction last November.
For the 12 weeks ended April 20, Alpo claims to have snared
more than 9% of the market for premium canned cat food and
more than 5% of the dry cat-food market.
   Grand Met put the pet-food business up for sale at a time
when competition in the mature industry has been especially
fierce. Sales growth has been sluggish, reflecting pet
owners' growing preference for cats over dogs.
   Since 1983, the number of dogs in the U.S. has been steady
at around 50 million, while the number of cats has climbed
25% to 57.9 million, according to industry estimates.
   With its entry into the cat-food business, Grand Met is
betting on this trend continuing. It is also marketing its
cat food by using the popular cartoon character, Garfield, as
its spokescat.
   A spokeswoman for Grand Met said, "It makes more sense to
keep the company {and expand it} and make it increasingly
more profitable than to sell it at a price that doesn't
reflect the value of the company." Previously, the company
had said it wanted to focus on its other food businesses,
including Haagen-Daaz, Pillsbury and Green Giant brands.
   Alpo, acquired by Grand Met in 1980, was one of the last
major pet-food makers to enter the cat-food market. Its
canned dog food leads that segment of the market, although it
has shrunk in recent years, according to estimates of
analysts.
   Several companies were rumored to be among the bidders for
Alpo, including Quaker Oats Co., H.J. Heinz Co., and Nestle
SA's Carnation Co. unit.
   "Some awfully smart companies looked at it and said no,"
said PaineWebber's Mr. Spencer, who said he finds Grand Met's
reversal interesting. "Maybe we are going back to real values
in the evaluation process."
