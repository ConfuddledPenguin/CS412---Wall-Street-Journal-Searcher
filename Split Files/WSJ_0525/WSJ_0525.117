   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank cleared $76.6 million in
loans to South Korea for technological research projects.
   The bank said $45 million will go to universities and
$31.6 million to several technology institutes, including the
Genetic Engineering Center, which supports South Korea's
biotechnology industry. Bank officials said the loans will
help strengthen South Korea's capacity for technological
innovation, while reducing its dependence on imported
technology.
