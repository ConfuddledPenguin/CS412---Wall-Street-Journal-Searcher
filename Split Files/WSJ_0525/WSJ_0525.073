   NEW YORK -- Resorts International Inc.'s debtholder
committees approved a revised reorganization plan with terms
slightly sweeter than outlined in a plan the company filed in
April.
   The hotel-casino company, which entered bankruptcy-law
proceedings last December, plans to file the revisions to the
plan with the bankruptcy court next Thursday. Resorts has
said it expects to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings by
summer's end. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from
creditors while it seeks to work out a plan for paying its
debts.

   The revisions essentially kept intact the April plan,
which calls for the swap of a total of about $930 million of
debt. The latest plan continues to give debtholders a 78%
equity stake in the company. Merv Griffin, Resorts' chairman,
who paid $365 million for the company in a leveraged buy-out,
will keep a 22% equity stake and would name a majority of the
board.
   The revised plan essentially speeds up interest payments
on about $187.5 million of senior secured notes and increases
the principal amount on new 10-year debentures by about $5
million. In addition, Mr. Griffin would increase the cash
infusion he would make to $28.5 million from $26 million in
exchange for cancellation of a $50 million note his Griffin
Co. owed to Resorts.
   The reorganization plan would leave the company with total
debt of $430.3 million. Resorts will be responsible for
payment of about $325 million of that amount; the other $100
million will come from rental payments on the lease held in
Showboat Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City.
   A spokesman for Resorts said the company believes it has
the necessary votes to win approval for the plan. Holders of
two-thirds of the value of the bonds and 50% of the
bondholders are required for approval.
   Balfour Investors Inc., a major bondholder that isn't
represented by the committees, is said to favor the plan. The
Resorts spokesman said the company won't try to sell its
Paradise Island property in the Bahamas until the plan is
approved by debtholders.
