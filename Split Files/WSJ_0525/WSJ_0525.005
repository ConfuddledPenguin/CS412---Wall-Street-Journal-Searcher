   ("More than two million mobile phones are now humming away
on the nation's highways." -- WSJ Labor Letter)
                                                                                                       

   Business used to be done in the office,
   Then at noon, over meals;
   Later, out at the club, it was par for the course --
   But now it's "Deals on Wheels."
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   Getting It Together
                                                                                                       

   Please don't send
   Any gifts to me
   That need "Part A" Attached to "Part B."
   Just say to the clerk,
   When my birthday comes,
   "Something simple, assembled,
   For a man with ten thumbs."
   -- Lionel M. Kaufman.

   Paws for Thought
                                                                                                       

   That polar bears will mate at all,
   And what is more, repeat,
   Is quite a thing, considering
   Both parties have cold feet.
   -- Dick Emmons.
