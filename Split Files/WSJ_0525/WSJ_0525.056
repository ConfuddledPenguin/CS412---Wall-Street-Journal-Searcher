   OCALA, Fla. -- Mid-State Federal Savings Bank said its
shareholders approved the proposed acquisition of Mid-State
Federal by First Florida Banks Inc.
   The agreement calls for First Florida to pay $54.2
million, or $25.07 a share, plus as much as $5.5 million, or
$2.34 a share, in proceeds from asset sales.

   Mid-State Federal said holders of 75.9% of its shares
outstanding approved the proposed combination.
   Officials at Mid-State Federal said they hope that the
acquisition can be completed by Sept. 30, but they added that
delays in receiving necessary regulatory approvals could push
back that date.
   First Florida, a bank-holding company, is based in Tampa.
