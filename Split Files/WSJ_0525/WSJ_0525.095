   MEXICO CITY -- Alas, in the real world love affairs don't
have happy endings. The Mexican government and organized
labor have been lovers for more than 70 years, but the affair
is now going down the tubes. It is a story with a dramatic
beginning, a long and happy -- but sinful -- middle and a sad
ending.
   Revolutions need a lot of money, but they destroy the
productive processes that generate it. This is why they print
too much of their own currency and then force people to
accept it. In 1916 Venustiano Carranza -- father of the
modern Mexican Constitution -- retook Mexico City with all
its problems and all its costs. But no one wanted his newly
printed "infalsificables". Everyone demanded the silver and
gold of the "ancien regime." Carranza decreed that wages be
paid with his flimsy paper and the nascent labor unions went
on a general strike demanding that their wages be paid in
coin.

   Carranza was outraged by "the tyranny of the unions" and
personally arrested the 11 strike leaders who came to see
him. He demanded the death penalty, invoking an 1862 law that
condemned as traitors those who refused the national currency
preferring that of the invading French army. However, he
couldn't find a judge who would impose such a harsh sentence.
When the dust settled, nobody had faced the firing squad and
the payment in coin had been resumed. Nevertheless, Carranza
was the ultimate victor. Organized labor reached the
conclusion that it could not really defeat the "federales."
If you can't beat them, join them.
   A tacit pact gradually evolved. Perhaps its terms were
never discussed, but they were clearly understood. For more
than 70 years organized labor has gone wherever the
government has led. In exchange, the government supported a
periodic increase in real wages -- till 1983 when it
unilaterally changed the pact to a one-way street. No quid,
all pro.
   The original deal sounds impossible and it was. Wages
cannot rise forever. But they did for more than 60 years. It
began during the very nadir of a country destroyed by
revolution, then civil war and finally free-for-all fighting.
The economy had nowhere to go but up. Then, in the very midst
of the world-wide Depression, the little-noticed and
long-forgotten Mexican miracle began. For 50 consecutive
years, the economy grew at an average rate of 6% per annum.
All labor contracts were renegotiated every two years, and
business -- with some arm-twisting -- found it could afford
to raise wages slightly above inflation every time. Moreover,
a low rate of inflation prevailed.
   The CTM (Confederation of Mexican Workers), en masse,
became a member of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary
Party), the official political party. The workers were not
consulted but they probably didn't really care. Wages were
going up every two years, and fringe benefits even more. The
quota of governors, senators and congressmen from CTM ranks
was increasing over the years. The CTM and the government
were sitting in each others's laps and everybody was happy.
Then came the economic downturn of 1982, and since then
nobody has been happy.
   After 12 consecutive years of overspending, overprinting
and overborrowing the real world caught up with Mexico. By
1982, we could no longer pay our debts, keep our money in the
country or hold the line on inflation. But we eventually took
our medicine like grown-ups are supposed to. We reduced
spending (good), we cut investment to the bone (terrible), we
negotiated a debt reduction (insufficient) and we lowered our
protectonist barriers (again, good). But most of all we
tightened the belts of farmers and workers.
   By government fiat, the rise of nominal salaries was
limited to less than the increase in prices. Real wages were
thus reduced and there has been an evident lowering of living
standards. The CTM has been the faithful ally of the
government in this "dirigiste" wage erosion. And both have
lost the workers in the process. Many unions have left the
CTM and now call themselves independent. More have remained
nominal members but won't even talk to the central body's
representatives. The CTM is becoming a mere figurehead. It is
no longer a real confederation of labor unions nor is its
leadership representative. It no longer can bring in the
vote.
   In the presidential and congressional elections of 1988,
workers voted massively for the leftist opposition led by
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of the late President Cardenas
(1934-1940). He is uncharismatic and wooden-faced, but "the
worst enemy of my worst enemy is my best friend."
   Can the now-precarious political system survive without
the support of organized labor? The 1991 congressional
elections will answer that question. My opinion is that it
might -- for now.
   President Carlos Salinas has proved to be what the country
was demanding -- a real leader. He has gained some popularity
and a great deal of respect. If the 1988 elections were to be
held again today he would win easily, the rightist PAN would
take second place and Mr. Cardenas' PRD would be a poor
third.
   The question now is: Can support for Mr. Salinas be
translated into votes for candidates of the discredited
official party? I think it is possible. But I wouldn't bet
the family farm on it.
