   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association said former chief executive officer Thomas A.
Spiegel was cutting his ties to the troubled thrift.
   Mr. Spiegel, who resigned as chief executive in December,
has been a consultant to the company in its attempt to sell
its $2.9 billion junk-bond portfolio. The sale is crucial if
Columbia, insolvent since Feb. 28, is to have any hope of
avoiding a federal takeover, analysts say. The bidding on the
bonds is believed to be in its final stages, and Mr. Spiegel
has decided to give up the consulting role, Columbia said.

   Mr. Spiegel's consultancy fee was, at the behest of
federal regulators, recently reduced to $1 a year from a
$500,000 annual rate.
