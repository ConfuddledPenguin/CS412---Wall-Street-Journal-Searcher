   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., trying to satisfy its
bondholders and avoid a bankruptcy-law filing, revised its
plan to recapitalize its debt and issue new common stock.
   The communications company, which said its core businesses
are operating profitably, has been struggling under a debt
load of $643 million, which current cash flow can't cover.

   The company has told the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it will have to file for protection under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code if it can't work out a new agreement
with its bondholders.
   Moreover, Western Union will face a moment of truth on
June 15, when it must make a $51 million interest payment on
its senior notes. It has told the SEC that it could be forced
into default if it can't find sufficient funds to make this
payment. The company's annual interest payments total $116
million.
   To avoid bankruptcy court, Western Union and its principal
owner, New York-based Brooke Partners Limited Partnership,
led by Bennett S. LeBow, the New York financier who also is
Western Union's chairman, have been trying to overhaul the
company's finances. Western Union wants to issue new debt
securities to holders of its senior secured reset notes, due
Dec. 15, 1992, which carry an interest rate of 19.25%, and to
holders of its 16% notes, due June 15, 1991. Debt from these
notes totals $530 million. Western Union also is seeking to
reclassify its preferred stock into new common shares.
   The 139-year-old communications carrier, which has been
hurt by a steep decline in its telex business, has cut its
work force more than half to about 3,300 from 8,000 in the
past two years. It also has scaled its operations back to two
basic businesses: Business Services, which include telex,
electronic mail and Mailgram; and Financial Services, which
include Money Transfer, voice messaging, telegram and bill
payments.
   "We've cleaned up the company," said Robert J. Amman,
Western Union's president and chief executive officer. "Both
of our businesses are healthy and operating profitably. If
we're successful with the exchange offer, Western Union is on
a long-term healthy path."
   Leigh Walzer, an analyst at R.D. Smith &amp; Co., a brokerage
firm that specializes in distressed securities, said Western
Union's problem "is no longer a business problem, it's a
balance sheet problem." He said the first plan's provision of
no interest payments for two years and a 5% interest rate on
some of the securities were "hot buttons" that turned off the
bondholders.
   "Another bone of contention could still be the equity
provision in the common stock that gives the bondholders 20%
immediately and 50% later on," Mr. Walzer said. "The
bondholders might still ask for 50% now. . . . {But} this new
plan is a pretty realistic proposal. I don't think the
company and the holders are especially far apart now."
   Western Union bondholders weren't available to comment.
   In its revised proposal in exchange for each $1,000 face
value of 19.25% senior reset note and 16% note, Western Union
is proposing to issue a new $400, 13% note, due Sept. 14,
1992, and a new $600 note paying 8% interest, due Dec. 31,
1995, plus 150 common shares, 200 Class C common shares and
300 Class D common shares.
   Interest on the 13% and 8% notes would accrue from Dec.
16, 1989, and be payable semiannually in the form of
additional new notes, rather than cash, through Dec. 31,
1991, and Dec. 31, 1992, respectively. In Western Union's
earlier proposal, no interest would have accrued or been
payable on the new notes for two years; also, the rate of
interest on the $600 note would have been 5%, rather than 8%.
   Western Union's current senior reset notes required that
the company reset their interest at a level that would allow
them to trade at par. To accomplish this, the company last
year had to raise the rate from 16.5% to its current level of
19.25%, but the bonds nonetheless are trading at 31 cents on
the dollar, or $310 for each $1,000 note.
   In an April 27 report to the SEC, Western Union said its
operating profit was $95 million from Financial Services and
$72 million from Business Services. But Western Union's cash
flow won't be able to handle the interest burden on its
senior debt, which will hit $96 million this year. The
company said in its quarterly report to the SEC that it
anticipates $102 million in negative cash flow this year and
$38 million in negative cash flow before interest payments
and after asset sales.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Western Union shares closed unchanged at 46.875 cents.
