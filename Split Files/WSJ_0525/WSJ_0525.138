   WASHINGTON -- The battle over clean-air legislation is
entering the final round as industry and environmentalists
gear up for the crucial House-Senate conference.
   The House on Wednesday approved its version of the
legislation, which would impose the nation's first controls
on acid rain, curb cancer-causing emissions from factories,
and take a new approach to cleaning up smog in all U.S.
cities by 2010. The Senate passed its version last month.

   When fully in effect, the legislation is expected to
impose about $21.5 billion in annual costs on industry.
"Everybody is going to find out clean air is not free," said
Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the House Energy and Commerce
Committee chairman, who predicted that the conference could
be long and difficult.
   Turning up the political heat on the conference, which is
expected to get under way soon after the Memorial Day recess,
is the threat of a White House veto if the measure contains a
House-approved unemployment-assistance package designed to
help workers who lose their jobs because of the legislation.
   The White House contends the five-year, $250 million
measure would create "a potentially open-ended liability"
because there wouldn't be any way to determine whether
workers lost their jobs because of the clean-air act or
another reason. Bush administration officials yesterday were
confident they could kill the provision or dilute it during
conference.
   The provision passed the House by a 271-146 margin,
however. And in the Senate, a worker-aid package almost
prevailed, despite opposition from Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine. Yesterday, an aide to the senator
said he hasn't yet taken a position on the House provision.
   Even before the conference, the bills agree on billions of
dollars of controls. Both would force utilities to cut
sulfur-dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year by
establishing an innovative pollution-trading system proposed
by President Bush. Under the system, utilities that made
extra-deep cuts would get pollution credits they could sell
or swap with other utilities.
   The measures would adopt a new system of regulating toxic
emissions that would force plants to install the best
available technology to reduce cancer risks to nearby
residents. Each bill would make auto companies clean up auto
exhaust and require the oil industry to make cleaner-burning
gasoline in an effort to reduce smog. "The differences
between the House and Senate bills are not legion," said Rep.
Billy Tauzin (D., La.).
   Among key issues to be settled in conference are:
   -- Whether to force the auto industry to start making cars
that run on alternatives to gasoline such as methanol and
natural gas. The House bill would launch such a pilot program
in California.
   -- How to determine whether to impose a second round of
cuts in auto-tailpipe emissions. Under the House bill, these
cuts, which the Environmental Protection Agency estimates
would add $500 to the price of a car, would go into effect
only if an EPA study determined they are needed and
cost-effective. The Senate would make the controls dependent
on the nation's air quality.
   -- How to force factories to reduce the cancer risk to
nearby residents after the best available pollution
technology has been installed. Industry and environmentalists
generally prefer the House approach.
   -- How hard to crack down on industrial sources of
smog-producing chemicals. The House would give a stronger
role to the federal government in forcing states and cities
to clean up smog.
   Although they are contained in both bills, the
reformulated gasoline provisions will be at issue as well, if
the oil industry has its way. To the dismay of the industry,
the measures spell out a recipe for gasoline to be sold in
the nation's nine smoggiest areas that would require the use
of oxygenated additives such as ethanol.
   House lawmakers generally contend they are heading into
conference from a strong position. After nine years of being
unable to even bring a clean-air bill to the floor, the House
completed voting on its measure in a single day. The speed
reflected the effort by Mr. Dingell, a friend to industry,
and Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), a strong
environmentalist, to lock up agreements on almost all
contentious issues before they got to the floor. On several
major issues -- including auto-tailpipe emissions and
controls on industrial smog -- the lawmakers are committed to
the accords through conference.
   By contrast, the Senate debate took longer, and leaders
were governed during floor debate by an agreement worked out
with the White House. Mr. Mitchell, who said he would have
preferred stronger provisions on several issues, has
emphasized he is no longer bound by the agreement.
   Both industry groups and environmentalists alike expressed
optimism yesterday that the conference committee would
produce a better bill than either the House or the Senate
version. William Fay, head of an industrywide lobbying group,
said, "I see some real opportunities to make these bills
better. Mr. Dingell can be fairly formidable in a conference
committee."
   Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club said, "By
taking the best from each, we can have a clean-air
masterpiece."
