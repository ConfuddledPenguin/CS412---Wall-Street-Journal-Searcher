   LONDON -- British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings PLC, the
troubled U.K. financial services group, said yesterday it
plans to sell its money, government-securities and
stock-brokerage subsidiary, Exco International PLC.
   Exco operates in 17 major financial centers and forms one
of the core businesses of B&amp;C. The unit is one of the larger
players in the London money-broking business, a professional
interbank market in which several big firms function as
intermediaries among trading banks and financial
institutions.

   The decision follows last month's announcement that B&amp;C
intends to sell various assets in an attempt to strengthen
its finances in the wake of massive losses at its Atlantic
Computers subsidiary.
   B&amp;C is writing off the whole of its #550 million ($931.4
million) investment in the subsidiary and is moving to sell
as much as #750 million of its own assets to reduce group
debt to more manageable levels of #250 million.
   The latest set of results -- for the year ended Dec. 31,
1988 -- show that Exco's pretax profit declined 39% to #48
million from #79 million the year before and that its sales
rose just 3% to #205 million from #199 million. Its results
for 1989 have been delayed due to its current financial woes.
B&amp;C paid #650 million for Exco in 1986.
   In 1988, B&amp;C's total pretax profit slipped 6% to #122.8
million from #130.9 million while sales rose 5.3% to #968.8
million from #919.7 million.
   Exco may attract a price of between #230 million and #240
million, or roughly eight times recent pretax earnings,
according to analysts at London securities firm Smith New
Court. The estimate comes despite previous B&amp;C views that the
business could fetch #300 million or more. Said one analyst:
"The world and his wife may have a look, but once you get to
the end of the day, only a few people may want to bid."
