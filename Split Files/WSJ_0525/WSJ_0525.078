   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Adobe Systems Inc. said it
expects to report lower-than-anticipated fiscal
second-quarter earnings, reflecting significantly lower
revenue from its biggest customer, Apple Computer Inc.
   For the quarter ending June 1, the software company said
it expects to report earnings ranging from 27 cents to 35
cents a share, on revenue of $32 million to $35 million. It
added that it expected results for the remaining two quarters
of the year to improve from second-quarter level, but that it
expected fiscal 1990 results to be below analysts' current
expectations.

   In the 1989 fiscal-second quarter, Adobe had net income of
$7.6 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $28.1
million.
   "It is startling," said Bruce Lupatkin, a software analyst
at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. Adobe stock will "take
a major beating tomorrow," he added. The company estimates
were dislosed after markets closed yesterday. Adobe, finished
at $50.50 a share, up $1.50, in national over-the-counter
trading.
   Mr. Lupatkin said he had expected second-quarter per-share
earnings of 51 cents and revenue of $42 million.
   Adobe cited lower-than-expected revenue from Apple,
reflecting a 23% drop in shipment of Apple products
incorporating Adobe technology compared with the first
quarter.
   The company also said two other "significant customers" --
NEC Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- were
experiencing reduced shipments because of new product
development and delays.
   Adobe develops and sells programs that create images and
type fonts on desktop computer screens and printers. Last
fall, Apple, along with software giant Microsoft Corp., said
they would offer a product that would rival Adobe's
technology, but Apple has continued to be Adobe's most
important client. In March, IBM gave Adobe a boost when it
said it would provide Adobe's printer software with its OS/2
operating system for IBM PCs.
   "Adobe appears to be caught in a jetwash of a transition
here," said Mr. Lupatkin, noting that companies such as IBM
are "ramping up volumes, while Apple is fading into the
sunset. It is a transitional issue."
