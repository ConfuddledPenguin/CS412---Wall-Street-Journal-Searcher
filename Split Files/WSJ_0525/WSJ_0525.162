   VILA NOVA DE GAIA, Portugal -- In an office as long as a
tennis court and lined with portraits of royalty in gilded
frames, the managing director of one of Portugal's oldest and
biggest port-wine companies considers a problem of corporate
identity.
   Last year, says Alain Le Grand, Real Cia. Velha accounted
for nearly 12% of world-wide port sales. But still, he
admits, the company "isn't as well known as its market share
would justify."

   That's not for want of a name. Its official name is a
mouthful: Cia. Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro
S.A. It's also known as Real Cia. Velha ("royal old
company"), and in English it goes by Royal Oporto Wine Co.
The latter is a trading title adopted from the northern city
of Oporto, which gives port its name.
   Royal Oporto and three subsidiaries together own more than
a dozen brand names. But more than half of the 9.5 million
liters (2.5 million gallons) of port sold by the group last
year was retailed under the brands of other distributors,
such as Tesco and Safeway supermarkets in Britain and William
Pitters in France. The Royal Oporto group may be one of the
biggest port sellers in Portugal, but to the rest of the
world it is little known.
   Establishing a new identity -- that's the mission of new
management. Last year, financial problems prompted the owner
of Royal Oporto, Manuel da Silva Reis, to seek an outside
partner. The result was an agreement with Cofipsa, a
Portugal-based holding company comprising Portuguese and
Spanish investors in association with Cerus S.A., a French
holding company controlled by Italy's Carlo De Benedetti.
   In return for a capital injection of five billion escudos
($34 million), Cofipsa took 40% of Royal Oporto. Mr. Le
Grand, a Frenchman and former chairman of the liqueurs
concern Benedictine S.A., was hired to run it.
   By selling old wine under new labels in new markets, Mr.
Le Grand aims to make Royal Oporto one of the top-selling
port labels in the world. Last year it accounted for only
around 8% of the company's total sales, but officials hope
they can raise that figure to 50%.
   Mr. Le Grand has the additional task of keeping sweet an
alliance between the De Benedetti group and Mr. Silva Reis,
who retains his position as chairman and whose family is
still Royal Oporto's majority shareholder.
   For the moment, both sides say the partnership is going
well. But the toughest changes are still to be made, and Mr.
Silva Reis, a self-made entrepreneur who used to run Royal
Oporto like a personal empire, isn't known as an easy man.
   "I don't know what will happen when we start proposing
aggressive policies," says one of Mr. De Benedetti's
associates.
   The changes at Royal Oporto are part of a wider
restructuring under way in the port trade. In the 1950s, the
trade was fragmented among more than 100 companies. Some were
Portuguese-owned, others belonged to the descendants of
British and Dutch shippers who came to Portugal in the 17th
and 18th centuries. Problems began after World War II with a
slump in sales to Britain. Gradually, takeovers led to the
trade's domination by big companies, many of them
multinationals.
   Today the port business centers on fewer than 30 shipping
companies based in two neighboring cities near the mouth of
the Douro river: Oporto on the north bank, Vila Nova de Gaia
on the south. Only a few market leaders remain privately
held, including the Symington group, last year's biggest
volume shipper. Sandeman belongs to Seagram Co. of Canada;
Cockburn, Smithes is owned by Allied-Lyons PLC of Britain;
Croft is a holding of Grand Metropolitan PLC; and Offley
Forrester is owned by Martini &amp; Rossi of Switzerland.
   The changes in ownership have coincided with a general
shift in the drinks trade away from sales under generic
labels. Port, in addition, has had to contend with a trend
away from sweet, high-alcohol beverages. Port sales have
risen in the past decade, nonetheless. In part, that's the
result of a move up-market by many producers.
   In a business fortified with tradition, Royal Oporto has a
reputation as a maverick. Until recently, its policy was to
sell medium-quality port at competitive prices, either under
its own brands or to other distributors for retail under
their labels.
   In addition to its rich heritage, Royal Oporto has
valuable vineyards. Thanks to stocks totaling around 25
million liters, including around three million liters of
vintage port, Mr. Le Grand says, "I think we have the means
to develop an interesting strategy."
   Mr. Le Grand says one of his first steps has been to work
on a new marketing strategy, expected to be approved at a
board meeting next month. By eliminating minor brands and
concentrating on a few leading ones, he aims to increase the
company's visibility. Royal Oporto will become its main
brand, followed by Real and Silva Reis, a leader in the
French market. Mr. Le Grand also plans to develop new markets
in other countries, as well, including in Asia. In Spain, a
new market for Royal Oporto, the company has appointed as its
distributor Bodegas Berberana, a concern partly owned by
another De Benedetti interest, Cofir S.A., Cerus's Spanish
holding company.
   As the former chairman of Benedictine, Mr. Le Grand has
experience working in a family company. His family was
Benedictine's leading shareholder until the company was taken
over by Martini &amp; Rossi in 1988. At Royal Oporto, Mr. Silva
Reis is chairman of the board and the management committee,
but Mr. Le Grand holds the tie-breaking vote for both panels
in the event of a disagreement between the Silva Reises and
the representatives of the Cofipsa group.
