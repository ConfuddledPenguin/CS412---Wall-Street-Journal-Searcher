   Arms Control:
   Irrelevant at Best,
   Pernicious at Worst

   Secretary of State James Baker didn't get his reputation
for political aplomb for nothing. After a few hawks
criticized the arms-control deals he struck in Moscow last
week, Mr. Baker didn't sulk. He merely walked over to the
White House pressroom on Wednesday to say his critics have
"simply rejected the concept of arms control generally."
   Ouch, that hurt. OK, maybe not. (Richard Perle's been
called worse.) But it does point out how much the Bush
administration wants a nuclear arms-control agreement.
Whatever doubts Mr. Baker might first have had about
strategic arms reductions (START), he and Mr. Bush are now
converts. The open question is whether arms control is going
to turn out as well as the cheerful handshakes and
photographs at next week's Bush-Gorbachev summit will
advertise.

   In one sense, the Baker strategy is plausible enough. The
main U.S. interest now lies in getting the Soviets to swallow
a historic defeat in Europe. That means getting the Soviet
troops out and keeping Germany in NATO. Anything that
interferes with that goal, such as Lithuania or strategic
arms, is secondary. Why worry about details when the big
prize is in sight?
   But that strategy also depends on a cooperative Mikhail
Gorbachev. And suddenly he isn't cooperating. The string of
Soviet concessions that prevailed until April has stopped. On
the Baltics, on strategic arms, on Germany -- Mr. Baker
returned from Moscow empty-handed this weekend. It doesn't
take a right-winger to wonder if pre-emptive U.S. concessions
will make Mr. Gorbachev any more agreeable.
   That's especially true because once again arms control is
proving to be irrelevant when it's not pernicious. Though he
clearly intended otherwise, the list of Soviet "concessions"
that Mr. Baker offered on Wednesday more or less proves the
point.
   Mr. Baker said they've agreed to tear down their illegal
Krasnoyarsk radar, yet in fact they haven't begun to do it in
practice. The Soviets have separated strategic defense from
START, but they've also vowed to repudiate START if the U.S.
ever deploys SDI. Some concession. And, yes, the Soviets will
destroy 154 big missiles (SS-18s), but the 154 that remain
will be so much more accurate that they're just as capable as
the original 308. Somehow this doesn't sound like a great
triumph.
   As for U.S. concessions, administration hard-liners don't
have much to show for their work. In February, the Soviets
agreed to the U.S. position merely to "declare" how many
nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles each side would build.
In April, they took that back; and in Moscow last week, Mr.
Baker agreed to the Soviet offer that each side include a
limit of 880 sea cruises for the first time. While that's
more than the U.S. Navy wants now, the history of arms
control suggests that cruise missiles will be the next target
of congressional budget-cutters.
   None of this matters all that much if we're entering a new
era of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. But it does if we've reached
Mr. Gorbachev's bottom line on reform. The details are
obscure, absurdly so, but they won't remain that way if the
new Soviet hard-line persists. How will cruise-missile limits
look to the U.S. Senate if there's violence in Lithuania? If
the Soviets insist on a neutral Germany, maybe even the
"Backfire" bomber will become an issue again.
   William Cohen, the relentless moderate from Maine, could
dust off his tough speeches on that Soviet long-range bomber
from the late 1970s. Someone could leak the story about the
Soviet defector who says the Soviets are lying when they say
they can't refuel the Backfire. (He says they let Backfire
crews practice on Soviet Bear bombers so they won't be
detected.) Obscure, sure -- until Sam Nunn starts asking the
questions.
   The point is that the fate of a START treaty depends less
on the mind-numbing details than on the nature of Soviet-U.S.
relations. Arms control is an artifact of the Cold War, when
it reassured Americans that the two sides were talking. The
few deals that were struck succeeded largely because they
barely affected either side's strategic interests. Like
START, they were mostly symbolic.
   But with ideological rivalry supposedly behind us, who
needs more symbols? If the Soviets are really bent on
cooperation, they'll reduce their forces in Europe and
elsewhere for their own economic reasons. Talk to an American
negotiator long enough, and he'll concede that even the
Soviets don't care all that much about START anymore.
   So why pursue START at all? The answer is politics. The
public retains a vague hope that agreements somehow make war
less likely, and politicians are only too happy to oblige by
signing agreements. With the Soviet hard-line on the Baltics
and Germany, Messrs. Bush and Baker want something to show
next week at what George Bush once said would be the "arms
control summit." A "historic" arms pact fits the bill. It's
the world's best photo-op.
   In cabinet-level meetings on START, Mr. Baker has rebutted
a rival's tougher proposal by saying, "I can't take that to
Shevardnadze," referring to the Soviet foreign minister.
Inside the administration, that usually ends the debate. To
satisfy critics outside, he'll still need to get the Soviets
out of Europe.
