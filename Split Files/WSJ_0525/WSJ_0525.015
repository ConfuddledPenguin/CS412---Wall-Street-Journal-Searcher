   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. and C.Itoh &amp; Co. are studying
the possibility of setting up an auto assembly joint venture
in Czechoslovakia with a local car manufacturer, a spokesman
for C.Itoh said.
   The spokesman said a joint inspection team from the two
Japanese companies is currently in Czechoslovakia. The team
has expressed its intention, in meetings with government and
auto industry officials, to go ahead with the project.

   The Czech auto company is Bratislava Automobile Works, or
BAZ, located in the city of Bratislava.
   A Toyota spokesman said the Japanese inspection team left
for Czechoslovia on May 12, by request of the Czech
government.
   The Toyota spokesman described the meetings as a
preliminary step to explore "a variety of possibilities,"
adding that no concrete plans have been made.
   Although the C.Itoh spokesman said no details of the
inspection team's visit will be forthcoming until after the
team returns, he said the companies are considering
assembling autos with a high percentage of parts made in
Toyota's U.S. facilities.
