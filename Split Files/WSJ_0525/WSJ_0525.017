   Inheritance plays a major role in how much fat a person
accumulates and where it builds up on the body, a new study
of twins found.
   An experiment in Canada, in which identical twins ate a
high-calorie diet for more than three months, found that
weight gain and fat distribution in one twin was remarkably
similar to that of his fellow twin but markedly different
from that of other, unrelated individuals. As identical twins
have identical genes, this indicated that the genes each pair
of twins shared played an important role in determining their
weight gain and fat distribution.

   The study added new evidence that a predisposition to
being overweight or obese can be inherited. But scientists
cautioned against misinterpreting the new findings.
   "There is a risk" that publishing the results of the
studies "may lead the popular media to declare that what goes
on in the home really makes no difference" in whether a child
becomes an obese adult, warned an editorial published in this
week's New England Journal of Medicine where the two reports
were published.
   The studies don't mean that genes automatically dictate
that a person will be overweight or obese regardless of how
much or how little he or she eats. Instead, the genes
inherited from the parents merely influence the way the body
handles excess calories. In other words, a person could
inherit a predisposition to obesity but whether he actually
becomes obese could be influenced by eating habits.
   The Canadian experiment, carried out at Laval University
in Ste. Foy, Quebec, involved 12 pairs of male identical
twins who agreed to spend 100 days living with researchers in
a special dormitory. After they determined each man's
base-line daily calorie needs, the researchers made sure each
man ate an extra 1,000 calories a day six days a week. Thus,
over the 100 days each volunteer ate 84,000 more calories
than he needed.
   Weight gains varied widely among the 24 men, ranging from
five to 30 pounds per person over the 100 days. The aim of
the study was to find out how much of this difference among
individuals was due to hereditary factors and how much was
due to environmental factors, the excess calories in this
case.
   The researchers found that when comparing one twin with
his fellow twin, there was far less variation in weight gain
than seen in the group as a whole. This indicated that the
genes were having a major influence on how much of the extra
84,000 calories each person stored as fat.
   The researchers also found that increases in lean and fat
tissues in one twin was similar to that of his fellow twin
although such changes in the fat to lean ratio varied widely
among twin pairs. The same phenomenon was seen when the
distribution of newly gained fat was measured. If one twin
tended to gain fat in the abdominal skin, so did his twin.
Such correlation wasn't seen when comparing twin pairs.
   A second study at Pennsylvania State University of 93
pairs of identical twins separated early in life and reared
in different homes found that genetic factors were about
twice as important as the childhood home environment in
determining adult weight.
   The analysis, also published in the New England Journal,
found that each twin's body mass was more similar to his or
her identical but separated twin's body mass than it was to
other members of each twin's adoptive family.
   The researchers in the Pennsylvania State University study
estimated that genetic factors accounted for 70% of the
difference in body mass among individuals.
