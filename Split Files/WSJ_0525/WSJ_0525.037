   Manufacturers and distributors of toxic chemicals may face
liability for environmental cleanups, even in cases in which
they weren't responsible for any accident or spill.
   Preliminary rulings in a handful of cases suggest that
courts may be heading toward the conclusion that, with
cleanup costs skyrocketing, the burden must be shared more
broadly.

   Under the federal Superfund law, companies that generate,
transport, store or dispose of hazardous waste are liable for
its cleanup. Chemical suppliers, who played no role beyond
manufacture or sale of their products, had assumed until
recently that they could escape such liability. Their main
legal concern was defending against suits by people who
claimed they or their property were damaged by exposure to
the products.
   The potential for environmental liability increases their
legal risk significantly. "The costs of cleaning up hazardous
waste are much higher than a generous personal-injury award,"
says Joel Schneider, a defense lawyer with the Philadelphia
law firm of Manta &amp; Welge, who has written about the trend.
   So far, most courts have required that a supplier can't be
held liable unless it played at least an indirect role in
disposal of the product. But if the supplier sells its
product to a waste-site owner, courts have assessed liability
against the supplier under the assumption that the supplier
was arranging for the product's disposal.
   Last year, a federal appeals court in St. Louis refused to
dismiss a suit filed by the Environmental Protection Agency
against eight manufacturers that did business with Aidex
Corp., a defunct Mills County, Iowa, pesticide formulator.
The eight companies hired Aidex to mix and package their
chemicals into finished pesticide products. The agency sought
to recover more than $10 million it had spent cleaning up
toxic waste at the processing site.
   EPA acknowledged that the companies, including Aceto
Agricultural Chemicals Corp. and Dow Chemical Co., hadn't
actually created or disposed of the waste. But the agency
argued that the companies should still pay for the cleanup
because the generation of waste was an inherent part of
Aidex's manufacturing process.
   "Automobiles contain transmission fluid and battery fluid,
which are technically hazardous substances. The fear is that
if you follow this case to its extreme, manufacturers could
be held liable under Superfund for the mere sale of a car,"
says Peter Gillon, a lawyer in the Washington, D.C., office
of the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, which
represents three of the defendants.
   So far, Mr. Gillon says, those fears have gone unrealized.
The government has yet to file other suits using that theory.
But the case has expanded "who might ultimately be liable and
can be brought into a settlement," says Glenn Unterberger,
associate enforcement counsel at EPA.
   Defense lawyers say the greatest litigation threat to
product suppliers comes from other industries seeking to
spread their own cleanup liability. Plaintiffs have relied on
a variety of state claims, including nuisance and negligence,
to make their cases. With several significant cases pending,
courts will be required to decide just how far liability
should extend.
   In one such case, Gelman Sciences Inc., an Ann Arbor,
Mich., maker of microfiltration membranes, faces potentially
huge damages for the contamination of groundwater by the
chemical 1,4-dioxane, which it used in manufacturing until
1986. Gelman filed suit in state court in Ann Arbor against
seven companies that made or sold the chemical alleging they
failed to adequately disclose its dangers and should
therefore bear the cleanup costs.
   The chemical companies have asked the court to dismiss the
case, arguing that they can't be held liable for
environmental problems arising after a normal commercial
sale. They say it is unreasonable to expect them to supervise
the handling of their products. Their motion is pending.
