   SYDNEY -- Australia's current-account deficit is expected
to have narrowed in April from March, but economists say that
is due to fewer business days in April rather than to a
contraction in average daily imports.
   The current-account deficit for April is scheduled to be
announced Monday.

   An AP-Dow Jones survey of 20 economists shows they expect,
on average, a current-account deficit of 1.2 billion
Australian dollars (US$919.6 million) before seasonal
adjustment, narrowing from deficits of A$1.8 billion in March
and A$1.3 billion in April 1989. Forecasts range from A$800
million to A$1.4 billion.
