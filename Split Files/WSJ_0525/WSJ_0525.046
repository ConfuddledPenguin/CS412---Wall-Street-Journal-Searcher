   WASHINGTON -- The national Republican political committees
continue to hold a huge cash advantage over their Democratic
counterparts, according to a study by the Federal Election
Commission.
   In the 15 months ended in March, the three major
committees of the Republican Party raised a total of $113
million, compared with $24 million for the three Democratic
national committees. In overall spending, the Republicans
held a four-to-one lead over the Democrats.

   With the 1990 campaign season about to move into high
gear, the Republican committees had $19 million in cash
reserves at March 31; the Democrats had only $6 million on
hand. As impressive as are the GOP totals, however, the
Republican committees have yet to raise as much as they did
in 1984.
   Fundraising results for the Democratic National Committee
and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee trailed
1986 and 1988 levels in the 15-month period covered by the
FEC study. But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,
which raised $10 million, surpassed its fund-raising totals
of 1986 and 1988.
   Still, Ron Brown, DNC chairman, said: "The DNC's
fund-raising program has made substantial progress over the
past year and is on track with the Democratic Party's
financial goals."
   At the same time the FEC released its study, the Democrats
made public a list of the party's top "soft money" donors,
who gave a total of $3.6 million to the party in 1989 and the
first quarter of 1990. Soft money consists of donations that
aren't spent directly on campaigns and thus aren't restricted
by federal election laws.
   Congress is considering a ban on "soft money" as part of
campaign-finance legislation. The DNC had resisted making
public its list of "soft money" contributors while the Senate
was considering the bill. Late last month, the Republican
Party released a list of wealthy donors who gave the party a
total of more than $7 million in "soft money" donations in
1989 and 1990.
   Among the top Democratic "soft money" contributors were a
number of labor unions, corporations and wealthy individuals.
They included: Archer-Daniels Midland Corp., $55,000;
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,
$150,400; Frederick Field, a California investor, $103,400;
Monte Friedkin, a Florida millionaire, $100,000; Jerome
Kohlberg, a co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, $25,000;
National Education Association, $135,000; Maurice Tempelsman,
a New York diamond merchant, $25,000; United Steel Workers
union, $100,000; United Auto Workers union, $130,000. Mr.
Brown's Washington law firm, Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow gave
$10,500.
