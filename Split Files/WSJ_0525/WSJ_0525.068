   Newsweek magazine is about to begin printing
"personalized" magazines -- including different ads for
different types of subscribers -- following the lead of
archrival Time magazine.
   The national news weekly, a unit of Washington Post Co.,
is struggling like other major, mass-market magazines to draw
new advertising dollars during one of the worst ad slumps in
years. The specialized editions also are part of the
far-reaching plans by Newsweek's new regime of top executives
to "raise the profile of the magazine" against Time Warner
Inc.'s Time. Those plans include ad packages with Washington
Post's flagship newspaper and its television stations.

   Personalized editions are the latest weapons that
mass-market magazines such as Time and Newsweek can use to
compete with local newspapers and direct mail. The Newsweek
program, for example, will offer advertisers specially
printed editions that will reach only "recent movers,"
subscribers who have moved in the last 12 months, and senior
citizens. The personalized editions also can address
subscribers by name, or give them the address of a car
dealership or retail outlet nearest them, by using a special
binding process known as selective binding.
   Newsweek, the perennial No. 2 of the prestigious news
weeklies, has been battling toe-to-toe for decades with Time,
and its latest ad twist just ups the ante. Time was the first
major magazine to embrace personalized advertising: In
December, American Isuzu Motors ran personalized ads, talking
to subscribers by name and listing the nearest dealer, in
three Time Warner magazines. In April, Newsweek performed a
similar feat for the New England Volkswagen Dealers
Association, naming the closest dealer in 160,000 copies.
Newsweek plans to expand the program in June to other regions
of the country.
   Newsweek's plunge into personalized ads is just one of
several new ad packages it is readying to announce that draw
together the various media properties of its parent company.
Peter W. Eldredge, who joined Newsweek as U.S. publisher in
March, and Alan G. Spoon, appointed president of Newsweek in
September, outlined the new packages in an interview.
   "It's important that we have on our menu a variety of
possibilities for the advertiser," says Mr. Eldredge, who
before joining Newsweek had put together similar cross-media
packages for Rupert Murdoch's various News Corp. properties.
"Time {magazine} is putting these bells and whistles. So we
have to show we are more than a one-magazine company."
   One of the new packages, for example, will offer
advertisers a discount if they buy both time on the ABC Radio
networks and pages in Newsweek. Another ad package, to be
unveiled in three weeks, will offer a combination of pages in
Newsweek and the Washington Post. The package is geared to
attract financial, corporate-image and national-association
ads, which Newsweek has had trouble attracting on its own.
   Mr. Eldredge said that eventually the magazine also will
offer ad packages that include commercial time on the four
Post-Newsweek TV stations in Detroit, Miami, Hartford, Conn.,
and Jacksonville, Fla.
   The new packages come at a crucial time for Newsweek, as
well as the newsweeklies in general. Once the dominant
magazines in the industry, the news weeklies have lost their
editorial leadership to TV news, while losing ad revenue and
readers to special interest magazines. For example, News
Corp.'s Murdoch Magazines, which was experimenting with
launching a new weekly news magazine, has shelved plans to
enter the field. "The climate is not right," said Leslie
Hinton, Murdoch Magazines president.
   While advertisers have been intrigued by personalized
editions, some industry experts question whether personalized
ads are just a gimmick. For one thing, the special binding
practice is quite expensive. Even the newsweeklies concede
that only a small number of advertisers are interested at
this point. Because of the cost, some skeptics question
whether the practice will ever be widespread.
   Messrs. Spoon and Eldredge don't believe their new plans
will suddenly make Newsweek No. 1 in a field that also
includes the U.S. News &amp; World Report. In 1987, Newsweek was
forced to follow Time Warner's Max-Plan, an ad incentive
plan, with its own plan that also offered discounts to
advertisers. Newsweek's Match Plan fizzled and was phased
out.
   But Newsweek's new executives do hope to wrest some
momentum away from Time. While the magazine doesn't plan any
major changes in its editorial approach, it's increasing the
number of separate, special issues devoted to single topics.
Last fall, Newsweek published "The 21st Century Family,"
which carried 55 pages of ads. In June, Newsweek will publish
"The American Teenager" issue, followed by "Educating
America" in September.
   "We can't change things overnight," said Mr. Eldredge.
"But we can be more aggressive. One magazine {Time} can't
satisfy all of an advertiser's needs."
   Time magazine's recent innovations include a special issue
last fall on the 150th anniversary of the birth of
photography that was sold to a single sponsor, Eastman Kodak
Co. Other special issues are planned for this year, but
Time's U.S. publisher, Louis Weil III, wouldn't disclose what
those issues will contain.
   "They {Newsweek} are following some of the things we've
done, but we are always looking for new ways to help
advertisers," he said. "We want our advertisers to see us as
a marketing partner."

   SNEAKER STAR: As expected, L.A. Gear signed singer Paula
Abdul to appear in TV commercials. L.A. Gear wouldn't
disclose the terms of Ms. Abdul's contract, but said it
represents "one of the largest celebrity endorsement
contracts" in the history of the sneaker industry.

   TV VIEWING: The American Association of Advertising
Agencies, a trade organization, said a two-year investigation
has concluded that the decline in TV viewing as reported by
Nielsen is in large part accurate. The organization issued
the report following complaints by the TV networks that
Nielsen's figures under-report the number of TV viewers. But
it found no "systematic problems" with the Nielsen system.
"This evidence . . . leads us to recommend the industry
continue to use the {Nielsen} data as usual," it said.
