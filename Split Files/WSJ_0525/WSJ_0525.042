   Your April 18 editorial "Are CDs Recyclable?" commits a
major gaffe in calling music CDs "metal" and "weeds in (the)
garden" (]) of our green, biodegradable earth. The shiny CDs
are sleek new laser plastics not likely to be recycled
because the music -- whether Beethoven or Bon Jovi -- is not
likely to be discarded.
   You should also know that these small, optical prerecorded
discs are also being widely introduced as CD ROMs, with 1,000
times the capacity of standard prerecorded data-storage discs
for personal computers. A larger laser disc (videodisc)
format with interactive video is capable of 5,000 times
today's capacity.

   CD ROMs can be far cheaper than today's computer discs or
their drives of equal capacity. Although introductory prices
for CD ROM players have been higher, within a few months they
will likely decline to substantially less (about $500). These
new devices are easily connected to desktop computers already
in use. Are we ready to use 1,000 to 5,000 times the info
available last week? Our educational missions will be
challenged sharply by increased demands for machines,
materials and the production of specially formatted
interactive video.
   There is one desktop computer for every three adults aged
18 to 64 in the U.S., a ratio that likely will double over
the next five years. You can bet that in 10 years, or soon
thereafter, there will be nearly as many personal computers
as adults. New educational initiatives are necessary to help
our students best cope with the wrenching changes resulting
in the school, home and office. Alas, the CD "weeds" will
even be in every editorial office.
