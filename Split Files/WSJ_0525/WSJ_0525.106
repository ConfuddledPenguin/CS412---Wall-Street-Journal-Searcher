   NEW YORK -- U.S. Treasury bond prices fell following
lukewarm demand for an $8.5 billion issue of government
notes, which helped break a string of records in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.
   The industrial average closed 0.71 point lower at 2855.55
in moderately active trading. Broader market indexes also
fell. Long-term Treasury bond prices fell three-eighths of a
point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face amount. The dollar
was mixed against major foreign currencies.

   Bond prices headed lower in the morning after the
government said the economy grew only 1.3% in the first
quarter, instead of 1.8% as expected.
   News of a slower economy usually is bullish for bonds,
because it may portend lower interest rates; bond prices move
in the opposite direction of rates. But much of the
slower-than-expected growth was attributed to a drop in
inventories, which suggests businesses may step up production
to replenish supplies. That action would strengthen the
economy, and possibly boost interest rates.
   However, bond prices recovered to move slightly higher
until shortly after the 1 p.m. EDT auction of five-year,
two-month notes. Rumors of weak demand for the notes drove
prices lower for the rest of the day, and stocks followed.
   One reason the Treasury note auction didn't go well was
little participation by Japanese investors, who are finding
attractive yields in their home market. The average yield on
the notes auctioned yesterday was 8.54%. The yield rose
immediately afterward, indicating that dealers had to cut
prices to sell them.
   Opposing influences are keeping the bond market from
establishing a clear direction, said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp., in Albany, N.Y.
Because of mounting evidence during the past few weeks that
the economy is weakening and inflation seems in check, bond
prices have rallied as interest rates eased. But, he
observed, there is a limit on how low rates can go and still
be competitive with West German rates, which have remained
high.
   This ambivalence also is starting to affect the stock
market, where "it's a real struggle between the bears and the
bulls," Mr. Johnson said.
   He expects both stocks and bonds to continue drifting
aimlessly until a week from today, when the government report
on employment growth and unemployment in May will give
investors their next significant reading on economic trends.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in active trading, with 155.1 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers, 791 to 725.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.60%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar ended mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was at 1.6830 marks and 151.05 yen, compared with
1.6765 marks and 151.45 yen Wednesday.
