   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee passed a
measure aimed at giving U.S. regulators leverage to open
Japan's financial markets to greater participation by U.S.
banks and securities firms.
   The bill, passed by a voice vote, would give U.S.
financial regulators the power to impose sanctions against
foreign financial companies whose home countries don't open
their markets to U.S. companies. Regulators would be able to
deny applications from foreign financial concerns to start or
expand their U.S. operations.

   The committee passed the bill after accepting an amendment
by Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) that would effectively
prevent the measure from affecting financial firms from the
European Community. The amendment was a signal the committee
is mostly concerned about the growing power of Japanese banks
in the U.S., while U.S. banks are frustrated with the
restrictions they face in Japan.
   The bill, co-sponsored by committee Chairman Donald Riegle
(D., Mich.) and its ranking Republican, Utah Sen. Jake Garn,
is opposed by the Bush administration, which argues it can
gain more access for U.S. companies through the current trade
negotiations.
