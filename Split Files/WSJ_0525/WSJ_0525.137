   NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed lower in moderate trading,
as early profit-taking in the wake of a disappointing
economic report proved to be too much for the market to
overcome.
   Tobacco stocks were especially weak, as investors reacted
negatively to the prospect of new restrictions on cigarette
sales in the U.S. Energy and metals issues also ranked among
the day's poorest performers.

   Largely because of the declines in those sectors, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average just barely missed extending its
string of all-time highs to four sessions. The average went
down 0.71 point to 2855.55.
   About 155.1 million shares were traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, compared with 172.3 million Wednesday, as
activity started to wind down in advance of the Memorial Day
weekend. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the holiday
observance.
   Stocks dipped to session lows at midmorning, after the
government released revised figures on first-quarter gross
national product, which were weaker than expected. The data
showed that the economy expanded at a 1.3% annual rate in the
quarter, well below the government's earlier estimate of a
2.1% rate.
   Also, some futures-related program selling put further
pressure on stocks in the last hour of trading. The sell
programs went into effect after stock-index futures dropped
to relatively small premiums to the cash indices, permitting
traders to lock in profits by purchasing the futures and
selling baskets of stocks.
   But traders said a continued willingness among
institutional investors to lend buying support to the market
during periods of price weakness acted to cushion its fall.
"They're staying with solid names, especially the blue
chips," said Richard J. Ciardullo, director of institutional
trading at Raymond, James &amp; Associates, St. Petersburg, Fla.
   This emphasis left broader market measures lagging the Dow
industrials. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index posted the
equivalent of a six-point drop in the 30-stock average by
losing 0.88 to 358.41, while the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 0.38 to 195.47, and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index slid 0.44 to 333.84.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the Big Board by
a margin of 791 to 725, with 519 unchanged.
   Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., noted that investors "appear to be
focusing on a narrower and narrower group of growth stocks"
to carry the advance, especially technology issues. "What the
market seems to be saying is that it's not discounting a new
economic cycle or even a recovery in corporate earnings," he
said, pointing to a retreat in the Dow Jones Transportation
Average as a possible warning sign of trouble ahead for the
economy. The average dropped 7.11 to 1159.50.
   Philip Morris dropped 1 to 44 1/8 and topped the list of
most active Big Board issues, as 3.7 million shares changed
hands in composite trading. As part of an anti-smoking drive
aimed at children, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan proposed model state legislation that would ban
cigarette vending machines and institute a licensing system
similar to that used to control alcoholic-beverage sales.
   Among other tobacco stocks, American Brands retreated 1
3/8 to 67 5/8, and UST lost 1 to 29. Loews, the parent
company of Lorillard, fell 1/4 to 116 7/8.
   Oil issues came under pressure, as oil prices fell again
in the wake of a steep drop Wednesday, with July crude-oil
futures falling below $18 a barrel in New York trading. Among
the energy stocks in the Dow industrials, Exxon dropped 1/4
to 47 1/8, Chevron dropped 1 1/8 to 68 1/4 and Texaco fell
3/4 to 58 5/8.
   Lower oil prices also sparked a sell-off among oil-field
services stocks. Baker Hughes fell 1 1/8 to 27 3/4,
Halliburton declined 1 to 47 3/4, Schlumberger lost 3/4 to 56
1/4, Parker Drilling eased 1/4 to 9 5/8 and Rowan slid 1/2 to
13 1/2.
   Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 3/8 to 65 1/8,
contributing to the setback in the Dow industrials, as
selling hit the metals sector. Amax fell 1/2 to 24 3/4,
Phelps Dodge tumbled 1 1/2 to 59 3/4 and Asarco lost 1/2 to
26 5/8.
   But another of the average's 30 issues, McDonald's, gained
1 to 35 1/8, on 1.9 million shares, after two Chemical
Banking subsidiaries unveiled plans to package loans to the
company's franchisees into securities. The loans are to be
made by Golden Managers Acceptance Corp., a new company to be
known as Golden Mac.
   Compaq Computer, which declared a 2-for-1 stock split,
fell 7/8 to 122, as the technology sector faltered in the
wake of its recent surge. International Business Machines
closed unchanged at 118 3/4, Digital Equipment went down 1
1/8 to 92 1/8 and Texas Instruments slid 1/8 to 43 1/4.
   But Motorola surged 3 3/4 to 83 3/4 and peaked at 84,
marking the second consecutive session in which the stock set
a 52-week high. Japanese telecommunications officials
selected the company's speech-coding technology as the
standard for the cellular-telephone industry in that country.
Motorola also received an initial order for $35 million of
cellular equipment from a Japanese company for installation
within the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor.
   L.A. Gear, which gained 1 5/8 to 50 1/8, also set a
52-week high by rallying to 50 3/8 during the session.
Salomon Brothers, which reiterated a favorable
recommendation, said it believes the stock will continue to
outpace the overall market.
   U.S. Shoe rose 1 to 24 1/2, after reporting that net
income for its first quarter ended May 5 more than tripled
from a year earlier to $17.4 million.
   Paramount Communications gained 1 to 47 1/2. In its "Heard
on the Street" column, The Wall Street Journal reported that
Mario Gabelli, a portfolio manager, counts the stock among
his favorites. BHC Communications, another issue on his list,
rose 1 1/8 to 49 7/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.
   First Financial Management rose 1 7/8 to 25 1/8. Merrill
Lynch reiterated a favorable recommendation on the stock
after the company met with analysts Wednesday.
   Fuqua Industries climbed 1 7/8 to 23. PaineWebber upgraded
its investment rating on the stock to "attractive" from
"neutral," citing the possibility that earnings could be
better than expected because of the company's stock buy-backs
and acquisitions.
   CMS Energy went up 1/2 to 29 1/8. A Michigan appeals court
threw out a preliminary injunction against the company in its
dispute with state regulators about the use of proceeds from
the proposed sale and leaseback of CMS's Midland, Mich.,
power plant.
   The Amex Market Value Index rose 1.11 to 360.76. American
Stock Exchange volume totaled 23.3 million shares, compared
with 16.6 million a day earlier. There were 285 issues
advancing and 275 declining, and 269 were unchanged.
