   PITTSBURGH -- Clean Air is going to cost Big Steel big
bucks.
   Regardless of what version of the legislation is finally
signed into law, major steelmakers say they may have to spend
as much as $5 billion in the next five years to install new
technology to reduce hazardous emissions.

   Ultimately the legislation may force an industry long
associated with soot and smokestacks to accelerate efforts to
find a new formula in the century-old process of making steel
with coke ovens. And the industry estimates that converting
to a new process could cost more than $30 billion.
   "Our big concern here is cost," says David M. Anderson,
general manager of environmental affairs at Bethlehem Steel
Corp., the nation's second-largest steelmaker. He notes that
the expected environmental spending could all but wipe out
the entire industry's capital spending budget, which has
averaged about $2 billion annually in recent years.
   Yet even the United Steelworkers union, whose members'
jobs could be threatened, doesn't entirely accept the
industry's dire predictions. Jack Sheehan, the union's chief
lobbyist in Washington, says the industry has a long
tradition of resisting environmental regulations even though
cleaner processes often result in greater efficiency.
   "The history of coke oven cleanups has been positive and
without massive shutdowns," he says.
   Still, the new Clean Air legislation has targeted the very
heart of steelmaking: coke-baked coal -- which fuels blast
furnaces. But the baking process, done in huge and sometimes
leaky ovens, releases what environmentalists contend are
harmful gases that can cause cancer.
   Both the House and Senate want steelmakers to install the
best technology available to rebuild older coke ovens and add
new doors and seals. Rebuilding a coke oven costs close to
$200 million. And the industry estimates that nearly half of
the nation's 94 coke ovens need rebuilding or new doors and
seals.
   Under the stricter Senate version of the Clean Air
legislation, coke ovens would have to meet tight emission
standards by the year 2020 or be automatically shut down, a
provision favored by environmentalists.
   Steelmakers balk at the shutdown provision. They say
technology doesn't exist -- and likely won't for decades --
that could meet the stricter guidelines. As a result,
steelmakers dourly predict the shutdown of virtually all coke
ovens, resulting in the loss of 25,000 jobs. Moreover, the
industry says it would be forced to buy coke from foreign
competitors, or build coke ovens overseas.
   "We'd just be exporting pollution and jobs," says Mr.
Anderson.
   The House version is more palatable to steelmakers. While
it would still require them to use the best available
technology to hold down coke-oven emissions, it doesn't have
an automatic shutdown provision, nor does it have specified
emission standards. The final shape of the bill will be
determined by a House-Senate conference committee.
   Steelmakers haven't ignored coke oven emissions. In fact,
in the past 20 years they claim emissions have dropped 90% as
the industry built more efficient -- and cleaner -- ways to
bake coal.
   "We have a much better record than people give us credit
for," says Frank Luerssen, chairman of Inland Steel
Industries Inc.
   Still, the industry has accepted the fact that its coke
ovens must be rebuilt on a more accelerated program. But
having to spend $5 billion to install new coke oven
technology, they assert, means less money available to
modernize plants.
   "We have limited resources and we have to husband those
resources," says Mr. Luerssen. Most steelmakers don't have
investment-grade securities, he notes, making borrowing
difficult and expensive. Nor have they been successful in
raising cash by selling equity. And options to share costs --
such as joint ventures, downsizing and employee stock
ownership programs -- are limited, they contend.
   If the ovens face possible automatic shutdown, it will be
even more difficult to persuade steelmakers, their
shareholders and lenders to spend money for newer and bigger
coke ovens. "You can't plan or invest," says Bethlehem's Mr.
Anderson.
   With coke's status as the obvious environmental culprit,
steelmakers around the world are experimenting with more than
40 processes to reduce dependence on the dirty substance.
   In the U.S., the American Iron and Steel Institute, the
industry's trade association, and the Department of Energy
are developing a $30 million pilot program near Pittsburgh to
make steel in one step without coke. The so-called direct
steelmaking process is a high research priority in both Japan
and Europe.
   Environmentalists have used the prospect of cokeless
steelmaking to lobby for an automatic shutdown of polluting
coke ovens, arguing that they won't be needed in the future.
   But steelmakers say direct steelmaking has been studied
for 50 years and isn't close to reality, let alone commercial
application.
   Inland's Mr. Luerssen, who ran an unsuccessful direct
steelmaking pilot program in the early 1960s, questions
whether an economical cokeless process can be developed. "I'm
not holding my breath," he says.
   Even if such a method were found, steelmakers simply can't
shut down all coke ovens one year and install the new process
the next. He notes that it took 40 years to fully adopt
oxygen steelmaking vessels and that was a "relatively simple
process compared to this."
