   HIGH HOPES? Voters see the Soviet summit yielding even
better relations.
   Fifty-four percent say the impending meeting can
substantially improve ties, according to a new Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll. "Gorbachev's popularity is the
linchpin to U.S.-Soviet relations," say pollsters Peter Hart
and Robert Teeter, who conducted the survey for the Journal
and NBC. Despite the Soviet leader's Baltic, economic and
other woes, some 59% of U.S. voters view him positively, up
from 51% in December.

   But skepticism remains. By 50% to 38%, voters oppose
helping strengthen the Soviet economy; in December, such
support was favored by 45% to 40%. Voters are closely divided
on whether the Soviets can be trusted to live up to
arms-control agreements. If Gorbachev were no longer in
power, voters would distrust the Soviets by three to one, but
64% predict he will still be in charge two years from now.
   Voters split evenly on whether Soviet recognition of
Lithuanian independence should be a condition of any new
accords -- something Bush won't demand, and Gorbachev
wouldn't accept.
                                                                                                       

   DUMP QUAYLE? Voters would rather see Baker as Bush's 1992
running mate.
   Those polled prefer the secretary of state for the ticket
over Quayle by nearly two to one; Republicans favor Baker by
43% to 35%. "Particularly if the economy is bad, the
president is going to have to choose someone else," asserts
one GOP strategist.
   Only 29% of the 1,007 registered voters surveyed between
Friday and Tuesday hold positive views of Quayle, while 37%
view him negatively; despite concerted administration efforts
to burnish the vice president's image, those numbers are
virtually identical to soundings taken last November and
March. Baker's positive-negative ratio is 44%-20%. On the
other hand, he still doesn't match Gorbachev's 59%-16%.
                                                                                                       

   VOTER EDGINESS could nudge Bush toward a budget deal with
Congress.
   While the president's job-approval remains high, at 72%,
the percentage who say the country is generally going in the
right direction dips to 42%-38%, down from 47%-32% a month
ago. Bush's slipping economic approval rating could also
provide impetus for an accord.
   White House aides insist that a genuine, long-term fix
would be a potent political winner, easily outweighing any
flak he takes if he goes back on his no-new-taxes pledge. But
some would prefer no deal at all to a modest one that might
make it appear he gave up too readily on taxes.
   A key to selling any deal, aides believe, will be
convincing Americans that it restores "sanity" to the budget
process.
                                                                                                       

   RECESSION FEARS return to earlier levels after a brief
burst of optimism last month. In the new Journal/NBC poll,
30% expect a downturn in the next year. That is up from 23%
last month, but equal to the figures for January and March.
                                                                                                       

   REPUBLICANS GAIN in voter intentions for this year's House
races. Thirty-four percent say they plan to vote for the GOP
candidate in their district, while 33% say they'll vote
Democratic. Democrats had been consistently leading in that
barometer since last September.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS SEE a political edge in the pending
parental-leave bill. In the poll, nearly seven in 10 support
such a law even if it would mean additional costs to
businesses. Even some GOP lawmakers like Rep. Martin, running
for the Senate in Illinois, break with Bush on the issue.
                                                                                                       

   NO NUKES in Europe shouldn't be the U.S. goal, voters
believe. Seven of 10 agree that the U.S. should always
maintain some nuclear weapons there, while only 22% say
almost all such weapons should eventually be removed.
                                                                                                       

   HOSTAGE HOLDUP: Hope fades that more releases are coming.
   U.S. analysts say Lebanese Shiites rebuff Iran's bids for
more releases. Bush's small signals to Iran after Reed and
Polhill were freed fail to impress the hostage-holders as
expressions of good will. "They aren't viewing these as
reciprocal gestures," says one U.S. official. "They believed
us when we said they weren't linked to hostages."
   Bush remains wary of any stronger steps that might make it
appear he is negotiating with the terrorists. Voters in the
Journal/NBC poll approve his handling of the hostage
situation by two to one, but they are deeply split over
whether the U.S. should negotiate directly with the
hostage-holders; 48% oppose such dealings, while 45% favor
them.
   Forty-eight percent favor pressuring Israel to release
Arab prisoners to help gain the release of the U.S. hostages,
while 43% oppose such pressure.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Gender Gapski: While 64% of men view
Gorbachev positively, only 53% of women do. . . . Traitors to
their class? Fifty-seven percent of voters with incomes over
$50,000 would rather see higher taxes on upper-income
taxpayers than an increase in the gasoline tax. . . . The
G-8? By better than four to one, respondents would approve
inviting the Soviets to join in the economic summit of the
seven leading industrialized nations.
