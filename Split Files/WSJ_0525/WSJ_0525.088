   Motorola Inc. said Japan's largest telephone company chose
its digital voice technology as the standard for that
nation's relatively undeveloped cellular phone market.
   Motorola's selection raises hopes for that company and
others seeking to win bigger pieces of Japan's
multibillion-dollar telecommunications market.

   Analysts' reports on Motorola's apparent triumph sent the
company's common stock soaring to a 52-week high. It rose
$3.75, closing at $83.75.
   In Tokyo, an official at Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications who is involved with the selection said
the decision wasn't final, but that Motorola's equipment had
proved superior in competitive tests.
   The selection of Motorola technology by Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone Corp. means certain of the equipment in all the
cellular phones Nippon Telegraph sells would use systems with
specifications patented by Motorola -- no matter who the
supplier is. Thus the selection would open a huge new market
for Motorola as a supplier and a licenser of cellular systems
made by other manufacturers. A spokesman at Motorola, of
Schaumburg, Ill., couldn't immediately estimate the expected
size of the Japanese market or the anticipated added sales
for his company. But he said, "It will enhance our ability to
sell equipment in Japan."
   The Japanese ministry official said the digital voice
technology standard was one of three categories that were
being examined to draft an overall standard for Japan's
digital mobile phone system. He said testing hasn't yet been
completed for the other two standards, and didn't know if
Motorola was competing for that business.
   The Japanese official, who asked not to be identified,
said the ministry will reach a final decision on digital
standards by the end of the year.
   NTT's announcement last week that it selected Motorola,
along with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and AB L.M.
Ericsson of Sweden, to develop certain equipment was part of
the same study.
   Motorola last year complained that it was being excluded
from parts of Japan's analog mobile-phone market -- the
technology that is used for the current standard. Japan,
under threat of heavy sanctions from the U.S., opened up that
market to Motorola.
   According to some studies, Japan's mobile-phone market has
penetration only about one-fourth that of the U.S. But
analysts have said that opening up the market to more
competitors, in addition to moving to the more advanced
digital technology, may help cut prices and spread use.
   The Motorola technology specifically selected is its
speech coder, which translates the voice for electronic
transmission. Nippon Telegraph has said it expects to
complete development of a new generation of cellular phone
systems by 1992.
   Traditionally, Nippon Telegraph has rarely publicly
disclosed development projects, instead quietly farming them
out to Japanese companies. But, under U.S. pressure, NTT in
recent years has been trying to demonstrate publicly it is
opening up its procurement process to foreign firms.
   NTT ordered $350 million of U.S. equipment in the Japanese
fiscal year that ended in March, but this amount was
equivalent to only 4% of the company's total procurement of
$8.75 billion.
   Separately, Motorola said it received a $35 million order
for cellular phone infrastructure equipment from Japan Mobile
Communications. Motorola said the order will be for equipment
"over the next year" in the Tokyo area. A spokesman said the
contract calls for unspecified additional orders. Some
analysts estimated the value of the contract could reach
several hundred million dollars during the next several
years, and represent yet another breakthrough for Motorola in
the burgeoning Japanese market.
