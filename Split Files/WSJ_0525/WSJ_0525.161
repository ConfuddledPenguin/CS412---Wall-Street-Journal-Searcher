   NEW YORK -- Michael Hegarty is one of the executives often
referred to within Manufacturers Hanover Corp. as its "West
Side bankers."
   The nickname, referring to the tough street kids in "West
Side Story," is meant as a compliment by some insiders who
feel that Manufacturers Hanover needs to be more hard-nosed
to prosper in today's difficult environment for banks.

   Manufacturers Hanover named the 45-year-old Mr. Hegarty
its group executive for real estate finance and consumer
banking. A native New Yorker, graduate of Iona College and
winner of the Bronze Star while leading a rifle platoon in
Vietnam, Mr. Hegarty captured the attention of Manufacturers'
top management for the dramatic turnaround of its real estate
portfolio.
   Since Mr. Hegarty took charge of real estate in 1987,
Manufacturers' portfolio of problem real estate loans dropped
to $95 million last year from $322 million in 1986. As a
result, its portfolio is in good shape compared with most
other banks that are awash in bad commercial real estate
loans.
   That's a welcome reversal for the nation's ninth-largest
banking company, long accustomed to being a leader among big
banks in problem loans in such diverse areas as energy
lending and loans to developing countries.
   And Mr. Hegarty has turned the real estate portfolio
around without simply turning off the spigot for new loans.
He has cut back sharply on the bank's construction lending,
but has increased its portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.
The bank now emphasizes advisory services, private placements
and the origination of loans for resale to other
institutions. Under him, Manufacturers was among the first
banks to create a permanent work-out group for bad loans.
   In keeping with the tough-guy image, Mr. Hegarty isn't
sympathetic to borrowers' requests for restructured loans
when a real estate project gets into trouble. "Our
inclination is to move a property out, as opposed to
restructuring the terms," he says. "The economics of
restructuring just don't make sense."
   Previously, Mr. Hegarty says, if a project was successful,
Manufacturers earned interest on the loan. If the project
went sour, Manufacturers was stuck with it. "We can't afford
to do that anymore," he says. "We're not going to take
equity-type risks for interest-rate returns."
   Gone also is the "manana" attitude that things will work
out for troubled projects, he says. A new "early warning"
information system tracks real estate projects and market
conditions on a quarterly basis. "It doesn't make a bad loan
good, but it's your headlights in the marketplace," he says.
   With about 55% of Manufacturers Hanover's total real
estate lending concentrated in Manhattan, Mr. Hegarty has
some definite ideas about the city's real estate picture.
He's most comfortable with prospects for big projects on the
East Side of midtown, where available space is limited and
land for new developments is scarce. The West Side, by
contrast, has too much space. "There's a pretty good chance"
that at least one and maybe more major projects on the West
Side will fail, he says.
   And he sees little likelihood that real estate development
in lower Manhattan will rebound anytime this decade from the
deep recession that has struck the financial services
industry and left an estimated 20% of premium office space
vacant. Any growth that might have occurred in lower
Manhattan will almost certainly be siphoned off, either by
big developments along the New Jersey side of the Hudson
River, where taxes, development costs and rents will be
sharply lower, or by development across the East River in
Brooklyn. The City of New York is subsidizing real estate
development in that borough.
