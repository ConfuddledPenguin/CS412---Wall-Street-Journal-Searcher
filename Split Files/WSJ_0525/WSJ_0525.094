   There are some who persist in swimming against the tide,
long after the exercise has lost its point. Not surprisingly,
they're on the United Nations' payroll. Gert Rosenthal, head
of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America,
recently chastised Latin politicians who put their faith in
the market. "Making the state smaller does not resolve
certain basic issues, like equity," he told the Washington
Post. "Privatization is fine in certain instances, but," he
noted with a familiar smugness, "it is not something to put
on a pedestal and venerate." Under the leadership of the late
Raul Prebisch, ECLA advocated many of the statist policies
that turned a depressed region into a bankrupt one. We
suppose that facing up to the absolute failure of policies
such as "import substitution" would mean folks of the sort
who people ECLA would have to give up their jobs.
