   Paying a Premium
   For Service Contracts

   SOME AUTO DEALERS are taking car buyers for a ride by
charging inflated prices on extended warranties.
   So says the New York attorney general's office, which
gathered pricing information from four auto makers -- Ford
Motor Co., General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and Toyota
Motor Corp. -- and from New York car dealerships. The office
concluded that dealers overcharged half of New York customers
who bought service contracts in 1989, or about 175,000 car
buyers.
   The attorney general's office defined overcharging as any
prices higher than manufacturers' suggested retail prices,
which include sizable profits for dealers. Where there wasn't
a suggested price, any price more than double the dealer's
cost was considered overcharging.
   In one case, the attorney general's office says, a New
York Chrysler dealer charged a customer $1,620 for a service
contract that had a suggested retail price of $250, and a
wholesale price to the dealer of $125.
   Based on its findings in New York, the attorney general's
office estimates that consumers nationwide paid $300 million
more than they should have in 1989 for such policies. A
spokeswoman for the National Automobile Dealers Association
says, "We are aware of the findings but have no comment at
this time."
   Extended warranties may not be worth the trouble anyway.
"Service contracts can be real moneymakers for the provider
{but} very troublesome for consumers," says a spokeswoman for
Consumer Reports magazine. She suggests simply buying a car
with a track record of reliability.
                                                                                                       

   Marketing to Women
   May Be No Different
                                                                                                       

   DON'T WE all want the same thing? A woman auto executive
says yes and declares "women's marketing" to be nonsense.
   For years, auto makers have talked up marketing to women
and spent big money on several programs aimed directly at
female buyers. The reason: Women buy lots of cars and
influence purchases they don't actually make. Last year, 47%
of all cars and 20% of trucks were sold to women, says a Ford
spokesman, who adds that growing female purchasing power is
bringing women's marketing "to a high point in the industry."
   But Laurel Cutler, Chrysler's vice president, consumer
affairs, and vice chairman of New York ad agency FCB/Leber
Katz Partners, says advertising aimed solely at women is
"patronizing and condescending." Ms. Cutler says women, like
men, want their cars to deliver quality, reliability,
enjoyment and style. She says Chrysler and other auto makers
should dismantle their women's marketing committees.
   A Ford spokesman, however, says its women's advisory
committee brought the company such recommendations as car
door handles that can be opened with minimum breakage to
women's fingernails. "There is a value to a women's marketing
committee," the spokesman says. "It comes up with concrete
things that are really worthwhile."
                                                                                                       

   Things That Go Bump
   Can Be a Nightmare
                                                                                                       

   CAR BUMPERS may not be the same even on vehicles that are
alike in virtually every other way.
   Toyota's Corolla DX, made in Japan and exported to the
U.S., sustained no damage when its front bumper hit a barrier
at five miles per hour in a test by the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety. But the car's U.S.-made twin, GM's Geo
Prizm, sustained $267 of damage in the same test. "There are
some differences in {the supporting} brackets that may have
accounted for the difference in performance," a GM
spokeswoman says.
   Overall, the institute says, bumpers did "a poor job of
preventing damage, and some were downright lousy." It
recently conducted a series of four five-mph crash tests at
different angles on 16 small, four-door 1990 cars. All
sustained extensive -- and expensive -- damage in the tests.
   The best-performing bumpers of the group were on Honda
Motor Co.'s Civic DX, which had $769 in damage. The Civic's
front bumper came out unscathed in a head-on barrier
collision, and the car suffered moderate damage in three
other tests. The worst performer was Daihatsu Motor Co.'s
Charade SE, with $3,838 in damage.
   The institute blames weakened federal requirements and
failure to supply consumers with bumper performance
information. In the early 1980s, new cars had to withstand
front and rear crash tests at five mph with minimal damage to
the bumpers. But for 1983 and later models, the
Transportation Department switched to 2 1/2-mph crash tests
and allowed more substantial bumper damage. "The result is
unnecessary damage in fender-bender crashes," says Brian
O'Neill, institute president.
                                                                                                       

   Price of Replacing
   Air Bags Is Dropping
                                                                                                       

   THE COST of replacing a deployed air bag depends on the
car.
   Ford says repairs average $475 for its driver-side air
bags and $575 for passenger-side bags. But at Mercedes-Benz
of North America Inc., those costs average $950 and about
$1,500, respectively. Chrysler's average cost is $300 for a
driver-side bag; the company doesn't yet offer one on the
passenger side. Nor does General Motors, which suggests
replacing the total air-bag system, rather than just the bag,
at an average price of $945.
   The good news for drivers: Insurance companies generally
pay to replace bags. And as air bags become more common, the
cost of replacing them is falling. Ford's charges have
dropped by more than $100 in the past year.
