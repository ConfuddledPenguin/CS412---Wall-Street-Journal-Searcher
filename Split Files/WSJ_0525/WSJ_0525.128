   Petroleum prices again drifted lower but may be starting
to level off after the $2-a-barrel plunge of the past two
weeks.
   Helping to calm jittery oil markets yesterday was a signal
from Saudi Arabia, leading producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, that seemed to suggest it may
hold output to quota for a few more weeks, even if others
overproduce.

   That didn't stop yesterday's price declines of as much as
31 cents a barrel in U.S. petroleum futures trading. But
there wasn't any further evidence of the panic selling that
had characterized oil markets for the past several days.
   In European markets, spot prices of Middle East and North
Sea crudes actually were marginally higher. But on London's
International Petroleum Exchange futures prices of the North
Sea Brent crude closed lower by three cents to 14 cents a
barrel.
   The bigger drops were in U.S. petroleum futures and
developed late in the trading day. The New York Mercantile
Exchange's July crude contract fell 31 cents a barrel to
settle at $17.83. Traders said this broke through important
technical support points and may signal some further softness
today.
   In other market developments, refiners' field postings for
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, settled 50
cents a barrel lower at $17 a barrel. According to Dow Jones
International Petroleum Report, Mexico effectively reduced
June contract prices for crude oil exported to U.S. buyers by
20 cents to 30 cents.
   The industry's fundamental factors still appear bearish.
The world is awash in crude oil from high OPEC output. There
is a massive overhang of crude inventories in the U.S. And
even if runaway OPEC production is beginning to slow, on-land
inventories could continue to build in the U.S. and in Europe
as the oil tankers now at sea reach shore and unload their
cargoes.
   As a result, few oil economists are brash enough to argue
that prices may have reached their lows for the year. But
they are beginning to suggest that a turnaround could soon be
in sight.
   Dennis Winters, an oil economist and DRI/McGraw-Hill
senior associate, is among those who believe a price bottom
is nearing, even though the short-term outlook remains weak.
"With the {production} problems in the North Sea, prices
would already be headed higher if storage wasn't chockablock
full," he said.
   Much depends, of course, on OPEC -- and, more
specifically, on Saudi Arabia, its kingpin producer.
   According to the Oil Daily's Energy Compass, which closely
follows OPEC developments, Saudi Arabia has decided to bide
its time for a few weeks more after cutting its own volume.
"Current Saudi thinking is to wait for early indications of
June output volumes" in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
chronic OPEC overproducers, "before taking any decision on
whether or not to reverse its instantly applied 300,000 to
400,000 barrels a day {in} volume cuts," the London-based
publication reported.
   Yesterday, Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister,
emphasized in the strongest terms yet that the kingdom had
committed itself at the May 2 OPEC meeting to abide by its
official quota, and he urged other OPEC members to do the
same. According to the official government statement issued
for Mr. Nazer, the oil minister "made clear that the kingdom
of Saudi Arabia would never market a single barrel outside
its agreed quota of 5.38 million a day."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS &amp; SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures prices moved
higher throughout most of the trading session on expectations
of renewed export demand from the Soviet Union. Wire-service
reports quoted Soviet officials as saying the country has
paid off the approximately $250 million it owed U.S. grain
companies, sparking market rumors that such payments are a
prelude to the Soviets' return to the U.S. grain markets.
Over the weekend Soviet newspapers carried criticism of that
country's grain-import officials for squandering scarce hard
currency on poorly timed and inefficient import programs over
the past year, which they said contributed to the country's
recent export-payment problems. Also supporting prices were
worries about a return of wet weather across many Midwestern
growing areas, which may hamper planting. The National
Weather Service's six-to-10-day forecast, released after the
close of trading Wednesday, called for precipitation across
much of the Midwest and normal to below-normal temperatures.
Soybean futures for July delivery gained 6.75 cents a bushel
to close at $6.1550. July corn futures added 4.25 cents a
bushel to close at $2.8050.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures trading turned quiet in the
wake of Wednesday's plunge, with prices recovering slightly.
Silver edged lower while platinum posted a modest gain. June
delivery gold ended $2.30 an ounce higher at $366.90, after
trading in a relatively narrow range. July silver was off
0.30 cent an ounce to $527.50. Platinum rose $2.50 an ounce
to $500.70. There was active demand for gold bullion,
according to one analyst. "The problem was that buyers were
still bargain-hunting, and they couldn't find many sellers at
the low prices, so there wasn't much trading," he said.
Another analyst observed that futures turned quiet because
Wednesday's selling simply lacked follow-through. The
observance of Ascension Thursday, a religious holiday, in
Europe, also contributed to the slower trading pace, he said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose because of concern about the
progress of the European beet-sugar crop. The July contract
ended with a gain of 0.45 cent a pound at 14.80 cents, which
was just under the day's high of 14.82 cents. Stephen Platt,
analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, said dry weather
had prevailed during the past month over Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union's sugar-beet growing areas. "If it persists
into June, it could affect production," he said. According to
another analyst, dry weather was becoming a factor for the
sugar-beet crops in Poland and France. The beets have been
planted and need the proper combination of sun and moisture
to grow properly. Also a possible contributing factor, the
second analyst said, was the continuing uncertainty about how
much sugar Brazil will have available to ship into the world
market from its 1990-91 crop, with a season that begins next
Friday. Brazil has to decide how much of the cane harvest
will be allocated for the production of alcohol for
automotive fuel and how much to earmark for export as sugar,
the analyst said. The problem has been hanging over the world
sugar market for some time, as Brazil is traditionally a
major sugar exporter, and it now appears that the concern is
growing as the harvest nears, the analyst said.
