   WASHINGTON -- An advisory committee of the Food and Drug
Administration recommended that Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle
Park, N.C., be permitted to market an anti-nausea drug for
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in the U.S.
   Glaxo's British parent, Glaxo Holdings PLC, already
markets the drug under the brand name Zofran in Great Britain
and France. The company is best known as the manufacturer of
Zantac, a popular anti-ulcer drug.

   An FDA spokeswoman said the advisory committee recommended
that the FDA encourage Glaxo to include information about the
drug's effect on children in labeling for the drug. She said
the advisory committee also said the company should do
further analysis of clinical data. The FDA usually accepts
advisory committee recommendations.
