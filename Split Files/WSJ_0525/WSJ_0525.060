   WASHINGTON -- A dispute has broken out over a crucial
question for entrepreneurs: Is a credit crunch really
striking small business?
   Contrary to expectations, a National Federation of
Independent Business survey found small companies generally
weren't finding it tougher to get loans than it was last
fall. The survey by the nation's largest small-business trade
group covered 2,300 such businesses, mainly very small
concerns employing a few dozen workers or less.

   But more than half the banks surveyed recently by the
Federal Reserve say they have tightened standards for lending
to small and medium-sized businesses in recent months. These
banks cite concern over the economy -- and the health of
their own loan portfolios.
   The NFIB survey showed little change in the availability
of credit between last October and last month. In the survey,
the "net percent" of business owners who say credit is harder
to obtain than in the previous quarter increased to only 8%
in April from 6% in January. (The study defines net
percentage as the share of respondents who said it was harder
to get credit minus the share who said it was easier.)
   "For now, the credit crunch is more smoke than fire,
though the smoke is thick enough to warrant a watchful eye,"
the NFIB survey concluded.
   NFIB President John Sloan called the credit-crunch "only a
rumor" a few days before the Federal Reserve Survey was
released. Yesterday, the group's chief economist, William
Dunkelberg, said the term "credit crunch" still overstates
what's going on nationally.
   "We're concerned about credit availability," said Mr.
Dunkelberg, who is also dean of Temple University's School of
Business in Philadelphia. "We're seeing more careful
documentation, more jumping through hoops and wailing and
gnashing of teeth to satisfy the comptroller of the currency,
but not necessarily a striking shift in availability. Once
you've done all your work, the credit's still there."
   The Federation does agree with reports from other groups
that businesses in the Northeast, the Southwest and those in
the real estate industry are having trouble getting
financing. But they also note that loan demand is down in
much of the country because economic activity is flat.
   Some say company size accounts for much of the discrepancy
between the NFIB survey and other studies. One-third of the
NFIB sample had annual revenue of less than $200,000, while
the bank survey focused on businesses with sales from $50
million to $250 million. Only 35% of those in the latest NFIB
survey classified themselves as "regular borrowers."
   A Federal Reserve economist said the NFIB study might not
have shown businesses were having difficulty getting credit
if those in the survey hadn't tried to get additional credit
or change the conditions of their loans recently. (He also
noted that most of the Federal Reserve banks indicated they
only had tightened lending policies somewhat rather than
severely.)
   Very small businesses "use so little credit that they
aren't affected" by the credit crunch, says Donald Lawhorne,
a Dallas venture capitalist. But many of the 55 companies in
his portfolio -- considerably bigger concerns than those in
the NFIB sample -- continue to have a difficult time with
lenders, he adds.
   Mr. Lawhorne says lenders continue to ask for greater
documentation, higher equity requirements and increased
collateral. The loan covenants are restrictive. "Things
haven't improved in the last year, they've gotten worse," he
says.
   Alamo Technologies Inc., a San Antonio maker of electronic
testing equipment and one of Mr. Lawhorne's portfolio
companies, couldn't get working capital after its troubled
local lender was acquired by an out-of-state bank.
   Alamo, which has annual sales of $4 million and is
profitable, had paid back by the end of last year more than
half of a $660,000 loan it received in 1986. But when it
applied for a new $400,000 loan to pay vendors on a $12.6
million Defense Department contract, the bankers said no.
   Alamo's chief executive, Doroteo Chavarria, is now turning
to financial factors for capital. Using factors -- companies
that buy accounts receivable -- is costly. But Mr. Chavarria
says: "It's the only way I can stay in business. I am going
to ride this wave and hope that things will improve."
   Others report signs of mounting trouble. "We're not just
in a credit crunch, we're in a credit crisis," says Jo Ann
Price, president of the National Association of Investment
Companies. She says entrepreneurs are now returning to
investment companies two and three times for loans, rather
than simply asking them for early-stage financing.
   "Our investment should make a company a bankable deal, but
it doesn't happen," she says. "We're there until the end
because so many companies can't get bank financing." She says
many of the companies having problems have about a million
dollars in annual sales and aim for sales between $5 million
and $15 million.
   The National Association of Manufacturers didn't find its
smaller concerns were in a credit pinch when it did a survey
in January and February. Sixty-two percent of the
manufacturers said their difficulty in getting credit hadn't
changed and many said they were trying to decrease their
debt. "But in March and April, we started to hear from people
that there's a problem," says Christian Braunlich, director
of the smaller manufacturers forum.
   Problems may be worse than they appear, too. "Companies
are reluctant to come forward," says John Galles, executive
vice president of National Small Business United. "They don't
want to tell their suppliers that they're short of cash and
they don't want other banks to know they're in a crunch."
   According to Michael Knight, a Fairfield, Conn.,
accountant, small businesses find banks in the area are
setting conditions that are impossible to meet. "Many of the
local banks will tell you there's plenty of money but when
you go to them, they won't respond," he says. One client, a
local provider of security services, asked a local bank for
an $80,000 loan three weeks ago. "They won't even return our
calls," Mr. Knight says.
   H-R Industries Inc., Richardson, Texas, says it found
lenders willing to finance expansion of its Midwest
operation, but couldn't get $250,000 to expand its hometown
manufacturing facilities.
   H-R, which manufactures double-sided, printed circuit
boards for communications and computer makers, says it has
annual sales of over $10 million and is profitable. When it
wanted the $250,000 loan, lenders conducted a new audit and
increased the valuation of the company assets by $500,000 --
but still wouldn't lend the additional amount, says Michael
Strathmeyer, chief financial officer. "They said that the
business conditions didn't warrant the loan," he adds.
   Mr. Strathmeyer now is obtaining the necessary capital
from a group of venture capitalists but says that the new
money, at a 14%-15% interest rate plus a stake in the
company, could raise his total cost of capital sharply.
   John Robinson, president and chief executive of the
National Minority Business Council, says members found
long-term loans getting harder to obtain even six months ago.
But now, the crunch has extended to shorter-term loans and
working capital requirements, he adds. With the economic
outlook cloudy, prospects for an improvement look bleak, he
says.
