   WASHINGTON -- Bags of powder from 16-inch Navy guns
ignited in a test yesterday, blowing a hole in the service's
explanation for last year's fatal gun-turret explosion aboard
the battleship Iowa.
   Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett ordered an immediate halt
to firing of the large-diameter guns on all four of the
Navy's World War II-vintage battleships and reopened the
search for the cause of the April 1989 Iowa explosion, which
killed 47 sailors.

   The Navy originally concluded that the cause of the Iowa
explosion "most probably" was an intentional act by one of
the ship's enlisted men, Clayton Hartwig, who died in the
explosion. Lawmakers weren't satisfied with that explanation,
however, and insisted on further tests.
   At those tests yesterday, Secretary Garrett said in a
brief statement, there was an "unexplained ignition" of bags
of powder used to fire such guns.
   Pentagon officials said yesterday's "follow-up" tests were
intended to evaluate a theory, developed by scientists and
engineers at the Energy Department's Sandia Laboratory, that
friction inside the gun could have sparked the Iowa explosion
and the resulting intense fire. According to these officials,
the tests simulated the force of ramming five fully loaded
bags of powder into the firing mechanism of the battleship's
gun with more force than Navy procedures call for.
   Officials said the first 17 simulated loadings didn't
create any explosion, but all of the powder bags exploded
during the 18th test.
   The Navy's embarrassing reversal came just one day before
officials from Sandia and the General Accounting Office are
scheduled to challenge some of the service's basic
conclusions about the accident in testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
   Mr. Garrett and Navy brass apparently hope to deflect some
of that criticism by quickly ordering a further investigation
of their own. But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), one of
the strongest critics of the Navy's Iowa probe, said in an
interview that the Navy waited too long to reopen the probe.
   "It's long overdue for them to admit their mistake . . .
and acknowledge that they had absolutely no credible
evidence" to support the theory that Mr. Hartwig purposely
caused the explosion, the Ohio lawmaker said. "It's obvious
that they know what's coming in the GAO report."
   Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, who was in charge of the
initial investigation, has maintained that months of
laboratory tests uncovered "unique foreign material" on the
projectile that was in the Iowa's gun barrel at the time of
the accident, indicating that the explosion was caused by
some kind of detonator rather than by unstable powder or
improper handling of the charge by the ship's crew.
   Scientists at Sandia, however, recently told Pentagon
officials and lawmakers that the laboratory's series of test
firings showed that friction from improper handling could
have been enough to ignite the powder used in the
battleships' guns.
