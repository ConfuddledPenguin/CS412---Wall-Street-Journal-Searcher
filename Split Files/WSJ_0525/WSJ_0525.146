   Micron Technology Inc., Boise, Idaho, beset by lackluster
demand for computer chips in recent quarters, apparently has
lost the interest of a major shareholder.
   The chip maker said it plans to register next month 3.6
million, or nearly 10%, of its common shares, for sale by
Amstrad PLC. Amstrad, a major British electronics concern,
acquired the stake in October 1988 for $75 million, or $21 a
share.

   The original transaction had been considered part of a
strategy by Micron to ensure long-term demand for its chips
as well as an attempt by Amstrad to secure stable supplies of
Micron's then-scarce dynamic random access memory chips.
   Lately, Micron has been beset by a chip glut. For the
fiscal-second quarter ended March 1, it reported net income
of $14,000, or less than a penny a share, on revenue of $77.5
million, compared with profit of $29.2 million, or 77 cents a
share, on revenue of $113.8 million a year earlier.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Micron closed at
$14, down 62.5 cents.
