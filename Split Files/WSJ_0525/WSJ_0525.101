   AMMAN -- Arab summits are generally better known for being
disputatious than for fashioning serious programs to advance
the cause of peace in the turbulent Middle East.
   Nevertheless, Arab leaders who will gather in Baghdad on
Monday have an extraordinary opportunity to construct a
platform that would bring peace to a region that has been
bedeviled by conflict for an eternity. They must be mindful,
however, that "peace" doesn't consist of politics alone: An
equally vital element of any peace settlement is sustained
economic development of our region.

   To be sure, this summit is not being held under auspicious
circumstances. Last Sunday's slaying of seven Palestinians by
a crazed Israeli gunman, the subsequent violence perpetrated
by Israeli soldiers in the occupied territories, and the
disturbances that have affected several countries -- these
things could well make any peace efforts even more elusive.
   But moderate Arab states are fervently hoping that this
summit will not degenerate into yet another frustrating
talkfest. This summit must push Arabs toward realistic
prospects of talking directly with the Israelis.
   Israel has paid a heavy economic price to ensure its
survival. The Israeli economy appears headed for disaster.
Israel's budget deficit rose last year to nearly 40% of gross
domestic product. The country's high defense expenditure
diverts funds from domestic development.
   The Arab-Israeli conflict has similarly imposed heavy
demographic and economic burdens on my country, Jordan. For a
country of barely three million people to be spending $600
million annually on defense -- or 16% of GDP -- is untenable.
Israel's occupation of the West Bank after the Six-Day War of
1967 deprived Jordan of 40% of its gross national product,
while thrusting more than 400,000 refugees upon it.
   Assistance from oil-producing Arab countries to Jordan to
cope with these problems has dropped sharply: to less than
$400 million today from $1.2 billion in 1981. As the revenues
of our oil-producing neighbors declined, remittances from
expatriate Jordanians -- whose skills have helped create
modern societies in the Gulf region -- have dropped more than
20% in the past three years to less than $800 million today.
Contributing to Jordan's economic problems has been the world
decline in commodity prices, although we have made every
effort to streamline the phosphate industry, which remains
our biggest export trade item. Jordan's total external debt
has risen from $3.5 billion in 1984 to nearly $8 billion
today.
   The "intifada," or Palestinian uprising that started in
December 1987 in the West Bank and Gaza, has resulted in
Palestinians liquidating more than $250 million in Jordanian
dinars held by them as cash reserves. Jordan has suffered
heavily as a result.
   Radical politics feeds on deteriorating economic
conditions. This is to no one's benefit. All parties in the
region should be mindful of the dangers posed by the
expanding fundamentalist movement that is rapidly winning
converts among our restless and unemployed young.
   Jordan believes that while the two superpowers must assume
greater responsibility in expediting the peace process, there
must be greater regional and interregional economic
cooperation. Such cooperation would provide political
stability and also enhance the constituency for peace in the
Arab world.
   The following are the potential building blocks for wider
economic and political cooperation:
   -- The Gulf Cooperation Council. The oil resources and
revenues of the GCC members -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- continue to be a
major factor in the economic growth of the region. The
creation of such sub-regional economic clubs invites a
bilateral dialogue between manpower-exporting states such as
Jordan and the resource-rich countries of the region.
   -- The Arab Cooperation Council. A relatively new
grouping, consisting of Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and what was
until recently North Yemen, the ACC seeks to think in
practical terms about common concerns, such as water, energy,
transportation and telecommunications. Arabs and Israelis
share a common geography and history. Why not a common
economic framework that would work for the benefit of
everybody?
   -- A United Nations peace conference. The most appropriate
vehicle for a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli
conflict is an international conference under the auspices of
the U.N. The only acceptable basis for a just and lasting
settlement is a fair exchange of land for peace -- as
embodied in U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338. These resolutions
call for the withdrawal of foreign presences from the
occupied territories, and also offer implicit recognition of
Israel's sovereign existence.
   -- Regional security. Jordan calls for an Arab Summit
meeting in order to formulate a peace strategy that would
safeguard the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and the
security and stability of the Arab regional order.
   -- Big-power support. The U.S., the Soviet Union, Europe
and the parties concerned in the dispute must work in concert
to generate peace momentum. Since the Israeli settlements in
the occupied territories violate international law, the U.S.
and Europe should predicate their subsidization of the
immigration and resettlement of Soviet Jews on Israel's
freezing all settlement activity in the occupied territories.
   Jordan has genuinely been the "middle ground" for the
region, not only because of its location but also because of
its moderate and practical approaches to the many issues
bedeviling the Middle East. Regrettably, Israel hasn't chosen
to join in the spirit of accommodation. Instead, it has
chosen to distract attention from the critical issue of
peace. This time it has gathered all its resources to welcome
a new wave of immigration -- a wave that provides a powerful
case for Israeli expansionists to keep the occupied
territories.
   But not only will this new immigration exact a price by
threatening all peace initiatives -- its economic cost is
staggering. The Shamir government has asked the U.S., for
instance, for at least $300 million to meet the expenditures
of settling Soviet newcomers in Israel. The chairman of the
Jewish Agency -- the main resettlement organization --
estimates that 750,000 immigrants will arrive in Israel over
the next five to six years. Israelis have already sent more
than 360,000 invitations to Soviet Jews, and Israel is
issuing 200 visas a day in Moscow to Jewish applicants. In
the first three months of 1990 more than 17,000 Jews arrived
in Israel from the Soviet Union. This could change the
demographic identity of the occupied territories.
   To provide safeguards against a breakdown of the peace
process, the development of a sophisticated long-term
strategy is required. Like all other conflicts, the Palestine
question has shown in the past few months that it is
susceptible to compromise. Change can be hastened through a
concerted effort. Proposals must be designed to accommodate
both the political requirements of the Palestinians and the
resettlement of Soviet Jews.
   There is ample room for everybody in the Middle East --
Moslems, Jews and Christians alike. With the establishment of
a genuine peace, I see Jordan emerging as a sort of Singapore
of the region whose economic progress would have a multiplier
effect -- a staging ground for international companies
wishing to accelerate their business in the area. We have the
skilled manpower, we have a superb infrastructure, we have
political stability, and we have a strong work ethic.
   But we don't have peace. Yet.
   Jordan truly believes that regional peace is a possibility
whose time has come. We, the players in the process, mustn't
permit the opportunity to pass us by, yet again. Any takers?
