   WASHINGTON -- European countries, with some help from the
U.S., defeated a Japanese proposal to set uniform standards
for high-definition television, making it more likely that
the new technology will develop differently on three
continents.
   The decision to defer adopting an HDTV production
standard, made at an international telecommunications
conference in Duesseldorf, West Germany, was largely a
symbolic blow to the Japanese. Japan Broadcasting Corp. plans
to start high-definition TV broadcasts in Japan next summer,
after the launch of two video satellites. So far, the
Japanese are about one year behind schedule. European
television makers, grouped together within the Eureka EU 95
project, are pushing their own standards. So are Zenith
Electronics Corp. and others in the U.S.

   High-definition TV refers to a host of new technologies
aimed at producing video monitors with super-sharp images.
The technology has become an important trade issue because of
predictions that the new sets will come to dominate the
consumer electronics market and produce huge business for
makers of semiconductor chips. The first sets are expected to
go on sale in the U.S. in the mid-1990s.
   In 1986, Japan, backed by the U.S., proposed to set a
standard for the production of high-definition videotapes.
These standards would be important for producing such studio
equipment as cameras and professional video-tape recorders, a
relatively small market.
   The Japanese also apparently hoped that getting their
production standard approved would help win approval of a
separate standard for transmitting high-definition shows to
homes world-wide. Winning approval of that standard could
mean tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments and give
a leg-up to producers of the new television sets.
   European countries, which wanted to develop their own
standard to protect their electronics industries, defeated
the 1986 proposal. Since that time, the U.S. backed away from
the Japanese proposal, and the Europeans continued their
opposition.
   In the U.S., a production standard isn't likely to be
adopted until after 1993, when the Federal Communications
Commission is scheduled to chose a standard for HDTV
broadcasts. It now seems likely that the U.S., Europe and
Japan will use different production and transmission systems
for the new technology.
