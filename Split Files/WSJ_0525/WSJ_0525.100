   The clean-air fuel of the future is still a subject of hot
debate.
   To the great dismay of the oil industry, Congress voted to
require the sale of an advanced, cleaner-burning
"reformulated" gasoline in the nation's nine smoggiest areas.
But nobody, including the industry, knows for sure what this
reformulated gasoline really is. A fuel capable of complying
with standards by the mid-1990s in proposed clean air
legislation hasn't been invented yet.

   Moreover, there still is a dispute over whether to rely
only on reformulated gasoline to help clean up the air.
Non-gasoline fuels such as methanol and compressed natural
gas could play a role. The Senate bill doesn't contain a
production mandate, so the issue will have to be decided in a
House-Senate conference committee.
   The oil industry had pushed to head off new federal
requirements and alternative fuels by pressing development of
reformulated gasolines that it already has begun selling. But
Congress came up with its own formula for gasoline because
"frankly, we don't trust them," says Rep. Bill Richardson, a
New Mexico Democrat.
   The Senate stunned big oil several weeks ago by voting in
an amendment to the clean-air legislation that defines a
specific type of less-polluting gasoline to fuel autos in the
nation's nine smoggiest areas, which comprise 25% of the
total U.S. gasoline market. These cities are Los Angeles, New
York, Houston, Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,
San Diego and much of Connecticut. The formula in the Senate
bill would require oil companies to boost gasoline's oxygen
content through the use of additives such as ethanol.
   The House approved a similar amendment as part of its
version of the clean-air bill. But while the House measure
also contains a recipe for gasoline, it gives the oil
companies greater flexibility to ignore the formula if they
can produce a fuel that yields environmental benefits that
are greater than those of the recipe fuel.
   "The industry keeps screaming about reformulated gasoline,
but when you try to take them at their word they seem not to
be very serious," says Rep. Richardson, who sponsored the
House amendment. The amendments specifying a formula "are a
way to ensure they do comply."
   The oil companies already have labeled as many as seven
newly developed gasolines as reformulated, angering some
lawmakers and even some industry officials who say these
companies -- Arco, Diamond Shamrock, Conoco, Phillips,
Marathon, Shell and Exxon -- are grabbing for a piece of a
market that doesn't even exist yet.
   "It's a real stretch to call these fuels reformulated
gasoline," says Tom Cachette, deputy executive officer of
California Air Resources Board.
   All of the new "reformulated" gasolines reduce the fuel's
volatility, or tendency to evaporate, which is required in
some markets anyway. Some eliminate a portion of the more
polluting components in favor of less noxious additives. But
most are available on a very limited basis and only in
certain locations.
   Some companies, such as Shell and Exxon, "have done
precious little," says Dan McKay, editor of Octane Week, a
trade publication tracking this issue. The two oil giants
have added a splash of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE,
but haven't cut down on aromatics or olefins, two major
offending gasoline components currently under scrutiny by
Congress. "A lot of companies blend MTBE into their gasolines
and don't pound themselves on the chest," Mr. McKay says.
"Exxon and Shell are trying to see how little they can do and
still call their gasolines reformulated."
   Oil company executives had expected more stringent air
quality standards to be imposed, but had assumed they would
be able to define the fuels to be used themselves. But
Lawrence Goldstein, executive director of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation and an industry partisan,
concedes: "They may have moved a little too fast and hurt
themselves politically. Congress may now feel compelled to
define the game for the industry."
   Representatives of the oil and auto industries claim that
they are testing at least 25 blends of gasolines to see if
they can come up with the formula that will clean up
unhealthy emissions that currently pollute the air. But the
earliest they'll know is late summer, says Joseph Colucci, a
General Motors Corp. executive acting as co-chairman of the
study.
   Currently there are hundreds of gasolines on the market.
All have similar properties but, like fingers on a hand, each
has its own specific print, dictated by what kind of crude
oil they were made from and at what refinery they were
manufactured. Gasoline sold under the same brand name by the
same oil company may have differing amounts of aromatics or
olefins but be close enough in other properties to be sold as
the same product.
   Industry experts concede that it is possible to make a
one-formula gasoline. But refineries would have to take on
the work of petrochemical plants, breaking down each fuel
component into separate molecules and then reassembling them
according to the predetermined recipe. It's a much more
complicated process than currently practiced and, by the
industry's reckoning, might mothball one-third of the
nation's refineries. "Under that criteria, gasoline could
cost consumers $5 a gallon," says Tom Austin, an industry
consultant and former EPA official.
   Congressional staff members contend the House language on
reformulated gasoline would raise the price of gasoline by up
to five cents a gallon.
