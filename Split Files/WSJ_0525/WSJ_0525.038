   HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's April trade deficit widened to
3.37 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$433 million) from HK$2.36
billion a year earlier due to a drop in domestic exports, the
government said.
   The trade deficit narrowed, however, from the shortfall of
HK$3.86 billion recorded in March.

   Total exports increased 3.8% to HK$47.27 billion from
HK$45.56 billion a year earlier, but was little changed from
HK$47.26 billion the previous month.
   April's imports were up 5.7% to HK$50.64 from HK$47.92
billion in April 1989, but off 0.9% from HK$51.117 billion in
March.
