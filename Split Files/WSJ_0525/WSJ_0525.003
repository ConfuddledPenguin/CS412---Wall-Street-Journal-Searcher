   LOS ANGELES -- Driving to work takes 50% longer than just
a year earlier here in the freeway capital of the U.S.
   The hassles of commuting have replaced real estate as the
main topic of cocktail party conversation. But although 79%
of residents still drive to work alone, more of them are at
least aware of a growing number of employer-offered
alternatives, ranging from car pooling to flexible job hours
and working at home.

   Those are some of the results of the State of the Commute
Report, a survey by Commuter Transportation Services Inc., a
nonprofit Los Angeles organization, and the Southern
California Association of Governments. The survey questioned
1,254 residents of four counties, comparing answers with a
similar survey taken last year.
   For most commuters, their morning trip to work is still
about the same distance as it was a year ago, or 16 miles.
But it now takes half an hour, compared with 20 minutes
previously. Getting home in the evening takes 60% longer, or
40 minutes behind the wheel instead of 25 minutes.
   Trying to beat the traffic, 28% of commuters surveyed hit
the road at dawn to arrive at work before 7 a.m. Almost that
many head home before 4 p.m., while 13% wait until after 7
p.m. Only 14% use car pools and just 4% use public transit.
   Atlantic Richfield Co., based in downtown Los Angeles, has
encouraged car pooling for nearly 20 years. Currently,
employees get a 30% discount off their $85 monthly parking
fee for each extra rider. Some 70% of Los Angeles employees
at Transamerica Life Cos., a unit of San Francisco-based
Transamerica Corp., pick the early flextime shift, starting
between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
   The South Coast Air Quality Management District, charged
with controlling air pollution in the Los Angeles basin,
operates on a four-day workweek. It also has a pilot
"telecommuting" program.
   Eight million people who own 6.3 million registered
vehicles reside in Los Angeles County; an additional two
million people are expected to arrive in the next decade.
   Voters approved construction of a 150-mile rail and subway
system back in 1980. By 1994, 46 miles of the system are
supposed to be in service. Voters will consider two new
public-transit proposals in next month's primary election
that would raise $18.5 billion over the next 10 years for
freeway-improvement and rail projects.
