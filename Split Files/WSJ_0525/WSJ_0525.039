   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange and American Stock
Exchange barred from membership a number of individuals and
disciplined several others for alleged violations of exchange
rules and federal securities laws.
   Gary R. Weaver, a former broker with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., agreed to be barred by the New York exchange
without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The exchange charged
that the Clearwater, Fla., resident, among other things,
misrepresented his authority at the firm by sending out
letters that purported to bind Prudential-Bache to repay
certain loans.

   James Carlton McLamb, a Raleigh, N.C., ex-broker with
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., was barred for what the Big Board
charged was effecting odd-lot transactions at prices more
favorable to customers -- including family accounts -- and
himself than the firm's procedures required. Odd-lot
transactions are trades of less than 100 shares. Mr. McLamb
has appealed the decision to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Also barred by the exchange were Dana Vincent Brackett of
Duxbury, Mass., formerly with A.G. Edwards & Sons; Charles
Cantrell Marshall of Phoenix, formerly with Young, Smith &amp;
Peacock; and Robin Newell of Johnson City, Tenn., formerly
with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Brackett didn't admit or deny any
wrongdoing. The exchange charged the three with, among other
things, misappropriating customer funds.
   Ann Marie Barone of Brooklyn, N.Y., a former broker at
Newhard, Cook &amp; Co., was barred by the New York exchange
until she responds to certain inquiries the exchange has
made.
   Stephen J. Samuels of Boston, a former broker at Merrill
Lynch, agreed to be barred by the Amex without admitting or
denying any wrongdoing. The exchange charged him with
recommending unsuitable trades, effecting options
transactions without customer knowledge or consent, and
issuing false documents showing fictitious transactions,
among other things.
   Thomas E. Malone of San Antonio, a former broker with what
is now Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., was censured and barred
for five years by the Big Board. The exchange charged that he
exercised discretion in certain customer accounts without
authorization, made misstatements to customers, and made
unsuitable trading recommendations.
   Joseph Robert Schwartz of New York, former broker with
Rooney Pace Inc., consented to a censure, a three-year bar
and a $3,000 fine without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
The New York exchange charged Mr. Schwartz with agreeing to
reimburse a customer for losses in an account and making
misstatements to the exchange.
   The following also were disciplined by the exchanges.
Suspensions and fines are noted. All were censured:
   New York Stock Exchange: Louis Matthew Sirota of Brooklyn
and Antoine Omar Khoury of London, each one year; Paul
Stephen Dolan of Boston and Lester Morehart Bolstad Jr. of
Plymouth, Minn., each three months; William Wallace of
Maitland, Fla., $3,000; Dale R. Bonga of Wheaton, Ill.,
$1,500; Daniel Munter of Los Angeles and Arnett Rolland Tharp
of Norfolk, Va., censure only.
   All except Mr. Dolan settled the charges without admitting
or denying wrongdoing.
   American Stock Exchange: Leslie Maladowitz of Cambridge,
Mass., one year and $6,000; William F. Leeson, Greenville,
S.C., suspended as a supervisor for 12 months must requalify
as an options principal; David Naulin of Newport Beach,
Calif., $5,000; Anthony Chrampanis of New York, $1,000.
   All except Mr. Naulin settled the charges without
admitting or denying any wrongdoing. Mr. Leeson declined to
comment, and all others couldn't be reached for comment.
