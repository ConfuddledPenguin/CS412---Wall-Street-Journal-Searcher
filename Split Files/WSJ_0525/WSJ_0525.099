   WASHINGTON -- Democrats on a House Judiciary subcommittee
challenged the Justice Department's explanation of why the
agency rescinded its longstanding support for proposed tough
new guidelines governing criminal sentencing of corporations.
   In a hearing yesterday before the House Subcommittee on
Criminal Justice, Paul Maloney, a Justice Department
official, said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in March had
given the order to rescind the department's support for the
guidelines for two main reasons.

   Mr. Maloney said the department wanted to analyze newly
proposed modifications suggested by the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, which sets guidelines for federal courts. He also
said a recent endorsement of the guidelines hadn't been
cleared through "the standard review process." Specifically,
Mr. Maloney said an endorsement issued in February by the
department's then-No. 2 official was given without the
approval of the attorney general.
   He added that Mr. Thornburgh's current consideration of
the proposed guidelines "doesn't in any way represent a
repudiation of the department's {earlier} position on the
proposed sentencing guidelines."
   But the Justice Department's apparent flip-flop on the
issue took on added significance when Donald Ayer, who issued
the February endorsement, announced his resignation effective
today. He accused Mr. Thornburgh of denying him appropriate
authority and of concealing alleged deceptions by personal
aides. The attorney general has denied these charges. But one
of the personal aides involved has announced his resignation,
and another has been reassigned to less prominent duties.
   The proposed sentencing guidelines set out a range of
penalties -- some of which could total hundreds of millions
of dollars -- that federal judges would have to impose
against companies convicted of such crimes as willful
pollution.
   During the sometimes contentious questioning, the
subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),
suggested that, in fact, Attorney General Thornburgh ordered
the endorsement withdrawn because business lobbyists, who
vehemently oppose the guidelines as being too strict, had
pressured the White House to intervene. Justice Department
officials previously acknowledged that following corporate
lobbying of the White House, President Bush's counsel
contacted Mr. Thornburgh's executive assistant, suggesting
that the sentencing guidelines get further review. But
Stephen Hart, a White House spokesman, said yesterday that
"It's simply not true" that the White House requested any
changes in the sentencing guidelines. "The charge is
groundless."
   Rep. George Gekas (R., Pa.) came to the Justice
Department's defense yesterday, saying, "It's important that
we poo-poo his {Mr. Schumer's} poo-pooing" of Mr. Maloney's
contentions.
   Attacking the Justice Department's explanations, Mr.
Schumer said that the modifications suggested by the
sentencing commission were minor and that they didn't require
significant additional review. Mr. Maloney conceded that not
all department correspondence to the sentencing commission
has been reviewed by the attorney general.
   In any case, the sentencing commission has said that
because three of its seven seats are vacant, it won't issue
the corporate guidelines until next year.
