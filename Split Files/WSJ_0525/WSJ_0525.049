   Boeing Co. confirmed that it received firm orders valued
at $3.1 billion for 20 747-400 jetliners from Japan Air
Lines. The order included options JAL exercised for 15 planes
and five orders booked but not announced in February, Boeing
said.
   The order, disclosed by JAL in Tokyo, includes options to
buy 34 more jetliners. Boeing valued the 54-plane package at
about $7.5 billion in current dollars, including $130 million
a plane plus spare parts and training.

   JAL's quoted cost for each 747-400, about $158 million a
plane, would place the total value of the 54-plane order at
$8.53 billion. Boeing couldn't fully explain its own lower
valuation, but a spokesman said that the difference might be
in future costs for parts and training. If JAL exercises its
34-plane option, "there won't be much training to be added
and the spares requirement (will go) down," he said.
   Seattle-based Boeing said that the order brings to 40 the
number of 747-400s ordered by JAL. The airline said it has
taken delivery on five of the jumbo jets so far. Deliveries
are expected to continue at the rate of about four a year
through 1999, Boeing said.
   Separately, General Electric Co. said in Evendale, Ohio,
that its GE Aircraft Engine unit received firm orders from
JAL for engines to power the 20 Boeing planes, and optional
orders for the additional 34 planes. GE said the orders for
the so-called CF6 engines, including the options, are valued
at $1.8 billion.
   JAL has ordered 104 planes from the 747 family since 1966,
Boeing said. The latest order brings to 1,002 the total
number of Boeing's firm orders for jetliners in the 747
family, of which 279 are for the 747-400.
   The 747-400 widebodies give JAL the ability to carry 375
to 404 passengers in a three-class configuration on flights
linking Tokyo with European and U.S. destinations. The
747-400 has a range of up to 8,400 miles and consumes 11% to
15% less fuel than its predecessor, the 747-300, Boeing said.
The aerospace concern said that it has delivered 70 747-400s
since the new model was rolled out in January 1989.
   With Japan's new wealth, air travel is booming. While the
nation's airports are clogged and operating at capacity,
completion of a new international airport in Osaka and
expansion of Tokyo's two airports, Narita and Haneda,
represents significant opportunity for expansion, JAL said.
People in the airline industry expect the growth rate for
Japanese domestic and international air travel to reach 6% a
year for the next 10 years.
