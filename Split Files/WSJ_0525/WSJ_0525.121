   MILAN, Italy -- Piero Barucci, the president of the
Italian Banking Association (ABI), was nominated yesterday to
replace the long-serving Lucio Rondelli as new managing
director of state bank Credito Italiano, ending weeks of
political maneuvering over the appointment.
   Mr. Barucci's nomination, one of several affecting the top
management of both Credito Italiano and its sister state bank
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), was a late choice after
protracted discussions between the bank, the state holding
company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) and
political parties in Rome.

   Mr. Barucci, 56 years old, has been president of the
Tuscan bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena since 1983, a job he
will now have to give up, as well as a professor of political
economy at the Universities of Florence and Siena, and ABI
president since 1987.
   The nomination came at a board meeting of IRI in Rome
yesterday, and was announced as the Credito Italiano annual
shareholders' meeting was already in progress in Genoa.
   While IRI nominates top officials in the banks under its
control, they still have to be formally approved by the banks
themselves. IRI owns 65% of Credito Italiano, which is quoted
on the Milan Bourse, and the bank's board is expected to meet
in the next few days to discuss the nomination.
   Mr. Rondelli, who had been managing director for 21 years,
was leaving due to having reached the mandatory retirement
age of 65. He reportedly declined an offer of a vice
presidency of the bank with some executive functions.
