   A Canadian truckers' protest, which stalled auto parts
from crossing the U.S.Canada border, idled nine Canadian auto
plants employing a total of 22,400 workers on Wednesday and
part of yesterday.
   The plants began reopening yesterday afternoon as auto
makers used alternative transportation -- including barges
and air shipments -- to move parts to Canada from the U.S.
"It looks like everything is getting back to normal," said a
spokesman for Ford Motor Co. of Canada, a subsidiary of Ford
Motor Co.

   The protest, which blocked trucks from using Detroit's
Ambassador Bridge and various other border entry points, was
started late Tuesday night by Canadian truckers who said U.S.
trucking firms enjoyed an unfair advantage under the
U.S.-Canada Fair Trade Agreement.
   The protest affected more than the auto industry. An
estimated 300 trucks daily cross the border between Vermont
and Quebec Province, transporting forestry products, steel,
granite and other materials. Many of these trucks were forced
to use alternate routes after protestors temporarily stopped
trucks from using the two main highways crossing the border.
   Separately, the ten major U.S. auto makers reported that
all assembly facilities are scheduled to operate next week.
   The domestic car makers planned to build 136,786 cars this
week, down 7.8% from 148,363 a year ago.
