   TOKYO -- Japan won't answer U.S. demands that Japan
completely liberalize interest rates on all bank deposits
within one year, a high Finance Ministry official said,
according to Kyodo News Service.
   U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford called for the
complete liberalization of Japanese rates Tuesday following
two days of U.S.-Japan financial market talks that ended with
both sides far apart on the question of how quickly
interest-rate deregulation in Japan should proceed.

   At a joint news conference following the U.S.-Japan talks
Tuesday, Japan's Vice Finance Minister for International
Affairs Makoto Utsumi denied that Japanese banks are gaining
a substantial advantage from the continuation of some
interest-rate regulations. Mr. Utsumi said both countries
agree that further liberalization is desirable but disagree
on how quickly liberalization should proceed.
