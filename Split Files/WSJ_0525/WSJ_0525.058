   NEW YORK -- The U.S. State Department wants to disconnect
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s plan to use the Soviet
Intersputnik satellite system to carry phone traffic between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
   Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, in a May
14 letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Alfred Sikes, said AT&amp;T's proposal would violate
international policies among the U.S. and the 118 countries
-- including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies
and Japan -- that own the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization (Intelsat).

   U.S. policy bars U.S. communications carriers from sending
public voice and data traffic over satellite networks other
than Intelsat's system.
   Mr. Eagleburger added that "insufficient foreign policy
reasons exist to deviate from applying the existing U.S.
separate systems policy to the AT&amp;T application."
   The FCC has yet to rule on AT&amp;T's request, but it is
doubtful the commission will buck the State Department's
finding.
   The use of Intersputnik is critical to AT&amp;T for several
reasons. The plan, which has been waiting for FCC and State
Department approval since last December, was a cornerstone of
a wider-ranging agreement signed earlier this month between
AT&amp;T and the Soviet Ministry of Communications that called
for the two to explore joint ventures in telecommunications
services, equipment manufacturing and research and
development.
   In addition, world-wide satellite capacity has grown tight
in recent years, and AT&amp;T and the Soviets wanted to use
Intersputnik to handle some of the voice and data
communications traffic that has increased 2 1/2 times between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union since 1987. What's more, Moscow
could pay for Intersputnik transmission service in rubles
much easier than paying for Intelsat service in Western
currency, which is scarce in the U.S.S.R.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said the company had received favorable
reaction for its proposal to use Intersputnik from the State
Department's telecommunications policy experts. But a
spokesman at the State Department's Bureau of International
Communications and Information Policy declined to comment,
saying Mr. Eagleburger's letter speaks for itself and the
department's position. He added that "the department would
support an amended AT&amp;T application for use of Intersputnik"
for private communications traffic.
   Intersputnik is run by a consortium of 15 Socialist
countries, which it services exclusively. Those members use
Intelsat to communicate with nonmembers.
   AT&amp;T currently derives less than 1% of its $3.5 billion in
international communications revenue from the Soviet Union.
It planned to link its network with Intersputnik to provide
150 circuits to augment the 32 now being used between the two
countries and to build a satellite Earth station in Roaring
Creek, Pa., to link with the service. Intelsat provides 20 of
the 32 circuits; the other 12 are handled by underground and
undersea cables owned by AT&amp;T and numerous foreign
telecommunications authorities.
   Asked whether the State Department's decision on the
Intersputnik plan would hamper AT&amp;T's other projects with the
Soviets, Charles Miller, AT&amp;T vice president and liaison with
the State Department, said, "down the road it could. At this
point, we just don't know."
