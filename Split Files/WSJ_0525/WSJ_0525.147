   Immunex Corp. scientists took a step toward creating a
potential new treatment for cachexia, septic shock and
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, the
Seattle company said.
   The scientists, in an article to be published today in the
journal Science, said they cloned the human gene responsible
for producing a receptor for human tumornecrosis factor, a
particularly toxic immune-system hormone that is overproduced
in certain disorders. Cloning the gene will enable scientists
to produce synthetic copies of the receptor to help shut off
overactive immune responses.

   Cachexia is a condition that affects cancer and trauma
patients, rendering the body incapable of processing
nutrients, while septic shock results from severe bacterial
infections commonly picked up in hospitals.
   The biotechnology company said the development was the
fifth so-called cytokine receptor that it has cloned.
Cytokines are immune-system hormones that regulate white
blood cells.
