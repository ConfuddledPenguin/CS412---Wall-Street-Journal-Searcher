   CENTOCOR Inc. and Genzyme Corp. shares were downgraded to
"hold" from "buy" by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
biotechnology analyst Stuart Weisbrod. Yesterday's OTC Focus
column said Mr. Weisbrod advised investors to sell those two
stocks and buy others he is recommending, but
Prudential-Bache said such action was suggested only for
"aggressive accounts." Mr. Weisbrod wasn't available for
comment, but Prudential-Bache made a copy of his research
report available.
