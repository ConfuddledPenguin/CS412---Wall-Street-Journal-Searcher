   TOKYO -- Crude-oil imports to Japan rose 26.7% on a yearly
basis in April to 119.1 million barrels, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The increase reflects increased domestic refining and
Japanese refiners' apparent effort to buy above-average
quantities of oil early in the year. The refiners had
expected oil prices to rise during this year, but prices have
fallen. Refiners have found themselves largely unable to take
advantage of the lower prices, because of a lack of storage
space.

   The kinds of oil Japan imported in April show the
country's move into a lighter -- and more expensive -- crude
refining slate. Mideast nations supplied 71.6% of Japan's
needs, or 85.2 million barrels.
   Domestic petroleum products sales rose 3.3% from April
1989. Sales of fuel oil, jet fuel, and naphtha all fell from
year-earlier levels. Sales of kerosene, vehicle fuels, and
gasoil were all higher. Products exports were sharply higher,
as a result of liberalized government refining policies.
