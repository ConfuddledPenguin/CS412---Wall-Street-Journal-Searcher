   ROME -- Italy's balance of payments surplus rose
marginally to 2.232 trillion lire ($1.81 billion) in April
from the 2.202 trillion lira surplus recorded a year earlier,
the Bank of Italy said.
   The April surplus was sharply lower, however, than the
4.190 trillion lira surplus reported in March.

   The central bank also reported that the balance of
payments showed a surplus of 8.184 trillion lire in the first
four months of 1990, compared with a surplus of 9.188
trillion lire in the year-earlier period.
   The central bank said the balance of payments surplus was
the result of a net capital outflow through the banking
system of 1.148 trillion lire as well as inflows totaling
6.899 trillion lire in the form of international investments
and loans.
   All figures are provisional and aren't seasonally
adjusted.
