   Rochester Community Savings Bank, Rochester, N.Y., said
its board adopted a rights plan to protect shareholders from
any unfair or coercive takeover attempts.
   The savings bank said the plan wasn't adopted in response
to any specific offer.

   The rights plan calls for the declaration of a dividend of
one right for each common share held on June 4. Each right
will entitle the holder to purchase 1/100th of a share of new
preferred stock at an exercise price of $100, should a person
or group acquire 20% or more of the company's shares
outstanding, among other conditions. The rights are to expire
June 3, 2000.
