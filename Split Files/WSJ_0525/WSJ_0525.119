   LAKELAND, Fla. -- Sikes Corp. and Premark International
Inc. said they agreed to settle two lawsuits that had been
filed against Sikes after Premark had offered to acquire the
company.
   In April, Sikes agreed to be acquired by Premark for
$16.40 for each Class A share, or about $201 million.
Moreover, Premark will purchase 861,136 Class B Sikes common
shares for $26.78 apiece.

   The two complaints alleged that Sikes' directors had
breached their fiduciary duties by failing to obtain the
highest price for the company and by adopting an allegedly
unfair purchase-price allocation between the Class A and
Class B shares.
   Under the settlement, Sikes will establish a special fund
for Class A shares and will reduce to $3 million from $5
million a fee payable to Premark.
   Premark, based in Deerfield, Ill., markets consumer and
restaurant products. Sikes makes ceramic tile.
