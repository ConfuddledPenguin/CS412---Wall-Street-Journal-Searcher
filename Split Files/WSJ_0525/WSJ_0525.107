   ELIZABETHTOWN, Pa. -- Baseball has many heroes. Roger Hall
isn't one of them.
   He might, however, hold two baseball records, if
statisticians knew about them. He's probably slid into bases
more times than Lou Brock, and he's probably toiled more
often in the field of dreams than Ray Kinsella.

   For years, Mr. Hall has been tinkering on what he calls
"Rogers Break Away Bases," baseball bases that are designed
to pop up under extraordinary force and thus reduce injuries
that can result from bad slides. He began his crusade when he
watched a friend tear out a kneecap sliding into a standard,
stationary base. "It was horrible," the wiry former infielder
and Elizabethtown College volunteer coach recalls. "I went
right out to find bases that might be safer. But I couldn't
find anything and decided I'd have to rig something
together."
   In Mr. Hall's perfect world, his base would work something
like this: Rickey Henderson gets a late jump trying to steal
second and has to slide hard to avoid a strong throw from the
catcher.
   Ordinarily, players hate to slam into traditional bases
this way for fear of injuring a knee, ankle or wrist, when
they slide headfirst. But this ball park is equipped with
"Rogers Break Away Bases."
   The Oakland outfielder's wrist rams into the base well
ahead of the tag. The sell-out crowd gasps, thinking he'll be
hurt. Instead of the all-star's joints buckling, the base
gives with a pop-pop-pop, detaching completely from the
rubber plugs holding it down on the field. Mr. Henderson, who
maintains contact with the flush-mounted rubber plate still
in the ground, stands unhurt and waves to the cheering crowd.
   It's a good dream, one that could have made Mr. Hall a
hero. But though he's found success in one unlikely sector --
the U.S. government -- baseball has been mostly unresponsive.
Minnesota Twins Manager Tom Kelly says flatly, "Who needs
them?"
   According to medical reports, plenty of people do. A
two-year University of Michigan study found Mr. Hall's bases
virtually eliminated base-path injuries on amateur diamonds
around Ann Arbor, Mich., while fields that used traditional
stationary bases saw one sliding injury every 14 games.
   In 1988, the Centers for Disease Control calculated that
breakaway bases could save $2 billion a year in medical
treatments to the more than 40 million Americans playing
organized ball every year. That's more money than the federal
government spent last year on AIDS research and treatment.
   What Mr. Hall didn't realize is that change comes slower
to the national pastime than pitches from a sore-armed
reliever. The National Hockey League adopted detachable,
magnetized goals five years ago to cut down on injuries. The
National Basketball Association went to breakaway rims when
ill-timed slam dunks raised the potential for player harm.
   But baseball treats its past with holy reverence, and the
15-inch-square bags that give the game its name are sacred.
"Baseball looks at innovations like these bases and asks, `If
the game has worked for the past 100 years, why change it?'"
says Bill Deane, a history reseacher at the National Baseball
Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. "It's a very
conservative sport."
   Indeed, the Official Baseball Rules covering bases haven't
changed significantly in the past 104 years, though people
have often tried. In 1875, John C. O'Neill of St. Louis
patented an "Enunciating Base." It featured a built-in bell
so "the touching of the base by the runner is clearly
announced to the umpire," thereby avoiding "dissatisfaction
and squabbles arising from erroneous observations and
decisions."
   More than 70 years later, two inventors devised a base
without "hazardous corners and side walls." Baseball has also
seen detachable bases -- in velcro, which didn't work once
they got dusty, and with magnets, made by the inventor of the
detachable hockey net.
   Mr. Hall has spent 17 years perfecting his base. In the
early stages of his work, he sold his house and moved with
his wife, Wilma, into a cramped mobile home. There he tested
model after model, sliding into them on his small, sloping
lawn. To keep going, he took odd jobs, like painting houses
and running deliveries around this small, Pennsylvania Dutch
town. He sold his wife's Ford Pinto, and, for a time, gave up
meat.
   "It got to the point where we couldn't afford to go to the
dentist and I stopped buying clothes for myself," Mrs. Hall
says. "It was very depressing, but something said to us to go
on a little further. His dream was so strong and I just
prayed the Lord would carry us through."
   Last month, the Halls thought some of their prayers had
been answered when top officials from two major league teams,
the Detroit Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays, expressed serious
interest in trying the bases. The Blue Jays used them on
fields at their Dunedin, Fla., spring training complex. Both
clubs agreed to use them with some of their minor league
clubs.
   "If we save just one player who the organization's spent a
lot of money to develop, these bases are worth the money,"
says Bob Gilson, general manager of the London Tigers,
Detroit's class AA farm team. "Then when these guys get to
the pros and start earning $1 million a year the stakes get
even higher. The players become assets teams have to
protect."
   In one recent game, a London Tiger outfielder thought he
was certain to injure his legs on a hard slide into third.
   "I knew I was going to jam something, but then the base
just came off and tumbled a few feet away," says 23-year-old
Steve Green. "Those bases may have kept me from really
hurting myself, but I wouldn't have known they were there
otherwise."
   But Mr. Hall had his sights set on the majors, not the
minors. Problem is, by the time a player is in the big
leagues, he knows how to slide. Detroit shortstop Alan
Trammell says he can't think of anyone who was seriously hurt
because of the traditional bases, held down by steel posts in
cement anchors. American League President Bobby Brown wrote
this to the Centers for Disease Control: "In my experience,
sliding injuries . . . resulting from abrupt violent contact
with the base by the runner has not been a problem in
professional baseball."
   Still, there are millions of Americans playing ball in the
minor or little leagues or on city and suburban recreational
fields. Wouldn't their organizations want to prevent
base-path injuries to baby Ruths and middle-aged Mantles?
   The Little League and the American Softball Association
seem to have nothing against the concept, but they want
royalties in exchange for endorsements. The Little League
asks 5% on the sale of each base. It's a price the
financially strapped Mr. Hall says he can't possibly pay.
   The city of Tucson, Ariz., has been a firm believer in Mr.
Hall's bases. But recently, city officials sent back a number
of them saying they had come unglued. The quality problems
scared a lot of recreational directors on thin budgets; a set
of three Break Away bases costs nearly $400, compared with
$80-$160 for ordinary ones.
   Mr. Hall says quality will no longer be a problem, now
that he's finally wrested his product from the company that
was producing them.
   Though spurned by the majors so far, Mr. Hall did find one
big-league fan: the U.S. government. Last year, the safety
benefits of breakaway bases were the subject of a House
Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Testimony there led to
the use of the Rogers Break Away Base at several military
bases and federal penitentiaries.
   Keith Marshall, sports specialist at a minimum-security
prison in Florida, praises Mr. Hall's bases: "People come
into an institution like this not knowing how to slide, and
you get plenty of ankle injuries in the intramurals and
leagues and tournaments we have with outside teams," he says.
"I'm a firm believer."
