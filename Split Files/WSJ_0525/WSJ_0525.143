   NEW YORK -- A European subsidiary of Texaco Inc. has
struck an agreement with the Soviet Union to cooperate on
geological research.
   As part of the accord, Texaco will furnish and install
sophisticated computer facilities at Vniizezhgeologia, the
All-Union Research Institute of the Ministry of Geology of
the Soviet Union in Moscow. The computer facilities will
process geophysical and geological data for assessment of oil
and gas potential in the Soviet Union.

   Texaco employees will help operate the equipment in
Moscow. In addition, Soviet personnel associated with the
institute's facilities in Moscow will participate in joint
studies at Texaco's Houston facilities beginning in June.
   Texaco officials believe that this agreement lays the
groundwork for other Soviet-Texaco joint ventures in the
future. "Texaco sees many possible business opportunities in
the Soviet Union," said Texaco Europe President Paul B. Hicks
Jr.
