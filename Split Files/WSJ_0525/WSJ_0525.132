   NEW YORK -- The final episode of "Twin Peaks," a
television drama, left a passel of unsolved mysteries but
lured 22% of the audience -- the highest share since its
debut six weeks ago.
   "Twin Peaks" was the top-rated program in the 10-to-11
p.m. time period. It was seen by 12.6% of all U.S. homes and
by 22% of all TV sets in use at that hour, according to A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings.

   The final episode fared well among viewers under 50 years
old, whom advertisers want to reach. It drew 34% of women
ages 18 to 34, who were watching television Wednesday night;
26% of women ages 35 to 49; and 28% and 22% of men in those
respective age groups. The series has ranked 49th in terms of
how many homes tune in -- but it ranks No. 28 among women
ages 18 to 49.
   "Twin Peaks" joins the ABC lineup as a full series next
fall. Fans will have to wait until then to resolve myriad
mysteries the series raised.
   "Twin Peaks" earned the highest ratings of any ABC show in
its time slot in five years, said Alan Wurtzel, senior vice
president at the Capital Cities/ABC Inc. network.
