   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 503 money-market funds
rose $94.7 million, to $381.41 billion, in the week ended

Washington trade association.
   Assets of 242 general-purpose funds fell $750.1 million,
to $129.48 billion; assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose
$703.4 million, to $159.13 billion. Assets of 159

   Mutual-fund assets were revised for the previous week
ended May 16 to $381.32 billion. The reported decrease of
$1.78 billion was revised to a drop of $2.18 billion.
   "After a string of weekly declines caused by a variety of
transitory factors, assets of money-market funds rose
slightly in the last reporting week," said Dr. Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist at the institute. "The
modest rebound in their assets occurred despite rising stock
and bond prices, which are usually associated with money
being switched out of short-term and into long-term funds."
