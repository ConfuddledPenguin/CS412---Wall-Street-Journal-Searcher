   DETROIT -- Frank Rekasi is preparing for doomsday.
   The 39-year-old auto worker isn't hoarding canned food or
building a bomb shelter. Instead, he has begun a second
career as a designer and producer of clothing for "people
with freer cash" than his daytime associates.

   Mr. Rekasi hopes to keep his regular blue-collar job as a
statistical processor at General Motors Corp. for a long
time. But the 20-year GM veteran learned a disturbing lesson
in the early 1980s, when a huge wave of plant closings and
employee layoffs hit the U.S. auto industry. Watching
co-workers cope with the shock of dismissal, Mr. Rekasi
realized "you have to prepare yourself for the ultimate. You
might have a job now, but what about later?"
   So Mr. Rekasi turned a sewing hobby into a second job,
laying a foundation for a future without GM.
   He is among a growing number of what are being called
defensive entrepreneurs: people who, while continuing in
their regular jobs, are developing new careers -- for psychic
as well as financial reasons. They're sacrificing weekends
and vacations to moonlight as small-scale landlords,
innkeepers, studio photographers, mechanics and owners of
hardware stores and hair salons.
   "I don't know if we're visionaries," Mr. Rekasi says.
"Maybe we're masochists or we just have a need to be active."
   Certainly people have always had hobbies, and moonlighting
isn't new. But the tremendous restructuring that hit
corporate America in the 1980s brought a new sense of
insecurity to many employees. Hundreds of thousands faced
unexpected layoff. Now, "by and large, people don't trust
their companies anymore," contends Quinn Mills, professor of
business administration at Harvard Business School.
   People who began their careers 20 or more years ago at
paternalistic companies tended to feel they had an implicit
contract guaranteeing them employment as long as they did
their job well. Now, Prof. Mills says, "that contract no
longer exists."
   Defensive entrepreneurship isn't easy. Nurturing side
ventures demands time and resources. There are no guarantees
these businesses will succeed, to say nothing of growing
enough to provide support if a job is lost. If the business
founders, invested money will vanish with it.
   Mr. Rekasi discovered a less-predictable hazard. Some
fellow union members initially resented his clothing design
business. "Some said that I believed I was too good for
them," he recalls. "Some say why not get out {of GM} so that
others who don't have a job can work."
   Still, three workers who have chosen to open small
businesses while employed say the risks are a small price to
pay for gaining some control over their future. The
insecurity at their places of employment is evident from some
numbers: The three employers -- GM, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. and International Business Machines Corp. --
have reduced their work forces by a total of at least 87,000,
counting those who left through early-retirement programs.
                                                                                                       

   Private Property
                                                                                                       

   Gregory Cesario started a real estate business several
years before voluntarily accepting an early-retirement
package from IBM. "I probably wouldn't have taken the buy-out
if I didn't have the business," says the 47-year-old
bachelor. "It helped me to make my decision."
   For the last eight of his 19 years at IBM, Mr. Cesario, a
middle manager in the company's industrial operations, had
dodged at least five departmental mergers and staff
reductions. He even tried to make himself more valuable to
IBM by learning about operations outside his department. "I
had visions of being in one of the top corporate echelons,"
he says. "IBM was all I wanted to do. But it had become
corporate musical chairs. When the music stopped, there were
fewer chairs than there were people."
   Concerned about his future, Mr. Cesario in the late 1970s
began buying modestly priced resort property to manage. In
the spring of 1988, he began laying the groundwork for his
first restaurant. "I didn't want to have 100% dependency on
IBM as a source of income. I wanted to be able to make
choices and not be told by IBM here is the choice made for
you."
   In December 1988, he got his wish: He volunteered for an
IBM early retirement program that amounted to two years'
salary plus $25,000. Mr. Cesario, now part-owner of three
restaurants, has traded managing a department for dish
washing, table clearing and bathroom cleaning, among other
duties. And his real estate holdings have expanded to include
condos and single-family residences, which he may rent out or
fix up and resell.
   Still, giving up a $90,000-a-year salary, bonuses and
frequent expense-account trips hasn't been easy. The
restaurant and real estate operations generate only about a
third what IBM paid him, so "now I think twice about hopping
on a plane," Mr. Cesario says, adding he's taken only two
business trips in the past two years.
   He hasn't played golf in almost a year, even though the
backyard of his Deerfield Beach, Fla., villa abuts a golf
course. And a "personal relationship is in jeopardy because
of all the time I have to devote to the businesses."
   He admits that "there have been nights where I come home
and watch the ceiling fan go around and around, wondering if
I did the right thing." But there have been many rewards, he
says. "I work when I want to work. I had the choice. It's all
mine."
                                                                                                       

   Room at the Inn
                                                                                                       

   Restoring old houses was just a hobby for Joseph Mulay
until deregulation of the telephone industry forced AT&amp;T to
divest itself of some of its holdings in the early 1980s. Mr.
Mulay, now 51, had a secure job as a planning and development
manager when he and another AT&amp;T employee decided to buy an
old Victorian house and refurbish it as a bed-and-breakfast
inn.
   Mr. Mulay, divorced with two grown children, wanted
something to fill his time. A former co-worker who was
eligible for a retirement package but waived it had told Mr.
Mulay he didn't feel as though he had enough outside
interests to keep him occupied if he left the company.
   Mr. Mulay's plan was that by the time he turned 55 the inn
would be open and profitable and he would retire from AT&amp;T.
His partner, Paula Williams, took an AT&amp;T buy-out in 1985 to
set up and run the Stanhope, N.J., operation day to day. He
gave up vacations and weekends to restore the house, which
opened in 1986 as the Whistling Swan Inn. So far, it covers
Ms. Williams's living expenses, and other income is plowed
back into the business.
   Then last November, four years ahead of his schedule, Mr.
Mulay accepted an early-retirement package after 32 years at
AT&amp;T. It appeared AT&amp;T would continue downsizing for some
time and "there were just fewer opportunities to move
forward," he said. The package, combined with the inn, helped
make the transition easier.
   After five months, Mr. Mulay is still undergoing
withdrawal from corporate life. The inn gives him "a
schedule, some requirements and a deadline," things he still
clearly needs. Other things he can do without. While
rummaging through his closet a couple of weeks before he left
AT&amp;T "it dawned on me that I don't need all these suits," he
says. "That part of my life is gone."
                                                                                                       

   Design for Living
                                                                                                       

   Frank Rekasi isn't ready yet to make his break even though
life at GM has become less secure. He says a "gut feeling"
kept him from taking a job at a new factory GM was touting in
Hamtramck, Mich., in 1985. Instead, he chose to stay in
material operations at an antiquated plant nearby that GM had
promised to close.
   His instinct proved correct. The new GM plant had problems
almost from the start with equipment and with slow sales of
the luxury cars built there. When GM laid off the second
shift of workers in 1986, only 16 months after the "plant of
the future" opened, Mr. Rekasi realized he couldn't depend on
the auto maker for lifetime employment.
   So he began devoting more time to clothing design. He
designs and produces evening attire and ensembles for
entertainers, specializing in leather. His leather dresses
start at $100, and a leather suit may sell for $2,500.
   Mr. Rekasi's father, who had worked 38 years at GM, didn't
approve of his starting a business on his own. "He said I
would never make a penny," recalls Mr. Rekasi, who is married
and has two children. "He couldn't understand. He said GM
takes care of its own."
   But industrial competition has stiffened, and GM and many
other corporate giants can no longer make such promises. Over
the past five years, GM has bumped Mr. Rekasi to various
plants in the Detroit area; he has been temporarily laid off
several times.
   His new business is more steady, even though it generates
revenue equal to only about a third of the $40,000 to $60,000
he earns a year at GM. But he says it is profitable, and has
helped get his family through the layoffs, including one
four-month period in 1987. During that period his clothing
business soared, convincing him he could make it if he had to
leave GM permanently.
   He hopes he won't have to for at least 10 years, though.
He still depends on GM for family medical benefits, and uses
part of his salary to build the clothing business.
   Between GM and clothing design, Mr. Rekasi works 12 to 14
hours a day and has given up some of his weekends. "Sometimes
there is a question of which is the second business," he
says. His wife helps out, managing the office in Lathrup
Village, a suburb of Detroit, and handling bookkeeping.
   Still, the demands on Mr. Rekasi sometimes leave him
little time for his 10-year-old son and eight-year-old
daughter, who don't always understand why daddy sometimes
spends so many hours making sketches and sewing when the
family is together in the evening. "Sometimes they ask, `Dad,
you got a minute?' and I don't," he says.
   This is painful for Mr. Rekasi, who remembers his father
giving up family life for work. "I had said I would not do
what my father did. But I have no choice."
