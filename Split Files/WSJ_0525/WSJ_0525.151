   Kinark Corp. said its directors rejected an unsolicited
$7-a-share, or $24.8 million, offer from Steel Partners L.P.,
but said it would consider another proposal later.
   Kinark, a Tulsa, Okla., owner of galvanizing plants and
chemical-storage facilities, said the board concluded that
the company is best served by continuing to pursue its
present business plan. It also said the offer was subject to
several conditions, which made the possibility of completing
a transaction uncertain.

   However, Kinark said it will consider a new proposal from
Steel Partners, a New York investment partnership, after
Kinark completes the planned sale of its Camelot Hotels for
$12 million, if the offer has fewer uncertainties that the
most recent proposal. Steel Partners has indicated than it
owns about 4.4% of Kinark.
   Kinark also said it expects to disclose election results
from its Wednesday annual meeting around June 1. Altair
Corp., Lincolnshire, Ill., which owns 6.7% of Kinark,
nominated three directors to Kinark's eight-member board.
Those candidates were nominated in opposition to Kinark's
three director nominees.
