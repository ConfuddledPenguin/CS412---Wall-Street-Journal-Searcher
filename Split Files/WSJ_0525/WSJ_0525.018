   LONDON -- Perkins Foods PLC, a small but hungry British
concern, is buying up bits of northern Europe's fragmented
foods industry in hopes of building a coherent manufacturing
and marketing network.
   Chairman Howard Phillips says his company, which deals in
a number of items from fresh produce to frozen pizzas,
intends to buy as many as six closely held companies across
the region this year.

   "Our main area of development will be in added value
products," Mr. Phillips says, with the aim of capturing more
of the profit built into food goods at various stages on
their way to consumers.
   Earnings at Perkins have grown quickly in the two years
since Phillips and a new management team arrive. In 1989,
Perkins pretax profit more than tripled to 9.78 million
pounds ($16.5 million) from 2.84 million pounds in the
previous 15 months. Fully diluted per-share earnings stood at
7.8 pence, up 32% from 5.9 pence.
   Analysts expect pretax profit this year to rise 62% to
15.9 million pounds, with per-share earnings rising 17% to
9.15 pence. In 1991, they forecast a further 16% rise in
pretax profit to 18.5 million pounds and a 15% rise in
per-share earnings to 10.5 pence.
   With debt of just $1.6 million, gearing at 10% and a
strong cash flow, the company is in a strong position to make
still more acquisitions, says analyst Charlie Mills of London
stock brokers James Capel &amp; Co. Ltd.
   The type of foods company Phillips says he is looking for
is of medium size, already profitable with pretax earnings of
about 5 million pounds and with plenty of room for growth. He
isn't keen on buying large companies which might be past the
bloom of youth, or small ones which need extensive work to
get through start-up problems. Wherever possible, he wants
management to stay on.
   In 1987, an investment team led by Phillips and Michael
Davies, who with Phillips was once a director of Hanson PLC's
Imperial Foods Ltd., took an initial 12% stake in what was
then a largely family owned business, John Perkins Meats PLC.
   Phillips' management team quickly turned the company
upside-down. Perkins divested itself of the original meat
trading business and snapped up 12 companies for a total of
70 million pounds.
   In the process, Perkins has acquired a clutch of added
value units that include frozen food distributor Nuka, frozen
foodmaker Van der Made and mushroom canner Holland
Champignons.
   Peppinos, the West German pizza maker, remains among the
company's flagships. Costing an initial 34 million Deutsche
marks ($20.4 million), the frozen pizza maker gives Perkins
the first of other much-hoped-for acquisitions in West
Germany as prospects for a unified German market for food
grows ever-brighter. "We'd like very much to realize what's
happening there," he said.
   Phillips believes the Perkins strategy leave little to
recession, with business exposure spread among northern
Europe's healthiest economies.
   "We believe in spreading the risk and not exposing
ourselves too much in any one country," the chairman says.
While the British economy may be slowing, he adds, "I see
little evidence of a recession on the continent."
   Central to Perkins' vertical integration plans, says
Phillips, is the expansion of the company's frozen products
which include pizzas, potato snacks and seafood.
   Already, frozen-food manufacturing bases in Britain,
Germany and the Netherlands have boast sales outlets in
domestic markets and markets in Scandinavia, France, Belgium
and Italy thanks to a network of marketing and distributing
units including Perkins' Nuka and Sunbird subsidiaries.
   In its bid to extend the company still further, Perkins is
now considering Denmark, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland as
host countries to further acquisitions in a bid to extend the
company well into the 1990s.
