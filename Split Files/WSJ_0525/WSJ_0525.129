   SAN DIEGO, Calif. -- Gordon Luce, chairman and chief
executive officer of Great American Bank, said he would
retire this year upon reaching age 65.
   "It is a time for change, and perhaps a new perspective
will assist the bank in moving forward in these changing
times," Mr. Luce told the annual meeting. The thrift doesn't
have a mandatory retirement program for executives.

   A longtime friend and advisor to Ronald Reagan, Mr. Luce
has been chief executive of the thrift since 1969 and
chairman since 1979. He will remain on the Great American
board.
   During the meeting, Mr. Luce also confirmed reports that
company officials had attempted to lure Federal Home Loan
Bank of San Francisco president James Cirona to succeed him,
but that the parties "could not work out the appropriate
package for his giving up the pretty outstanding position he
already has."
   Great American is the nation's eighth-largest thrift but
has had huge loan problems in Arizona and must raise $350
million in new capital by year end or face a possible federal
takeover.
