   George Bush gave new visibility to the black art of
cost-benefit analysis when he drew the line with Congress on
the Clean Air bill: If the legislation costs business and
consumers more than $21 billion a year, he would reject it.
   This attempt to convert cost estimates from debating
points to political weapons helped the administration
influence provisions of the Clean Air bill, but it also put
the spotlight on just how crude these estimates of costs and
benefits truly are.

   Take just one section of the proposed legislation
involving a far-reaching plan to reduce emissions of nearly
191 toxic chemicals, from acetaldehyde to xylene. On the cost
side, the Bush administration figures the price tag on the
Senate version eventually would total roughly $5.5 billion a
year. On the benefit side, the Environmental Protection
Agency predicts that between 1,100 and 2,000 fatal cases of
cancer would be avoided each year.
   Sounds precise. Unfortunately, even administration
economists concede the price tag is little more than a guess.
Much depends on how the EPA actually enforces a law that is
likely to be studded with such imprecise phrases as "maximum
achievable control technology" and "ample margin of safety."
   "We know virtually nothing about the cost of complying
with the regulations that will be written to control air
toxics," says Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for
the Future, a Washington think tank respected by both sides
of the debate. Hoping to influence the debate in Congress,
the National Association of Manufacturers has been trying to
commission a study estimating the cost to business of
complying with the law. "We haven't found anyone . . . that
has a lot of credibility out there," says Richard Siebert, an
NAM vice president.
   That doesn't stop industry from churning out frighteningly
large figures. At one point, the Business Roundtable released
a report saying that the original Senate proposal to reduce
emissions of toxic substances could cost business as much as
$64 billion a year; ultimately, the Senate passed a bill with
less onerous provisions.
   "When it is estimating the cost of compliance, industry
frequently will pick gold-plated solutions, the most
draconian solutions in the worst-case scenario and parade the
buckets of blood before the American public," complains Dan
Dudek, an Environmental Defense Fund economist.
   One problem, of course, is that estimators are aiming at a
moving target. When the Bush administration tried to figure
the costs of its own proposal, its bottom line was a range of
between $967 million and $11.67 billion a year. The
administration did agree on a misleadingly precise "best
estimate" of $4.729 billion. Nevertheless, economists at the
President's Council of Economic Advisers actually tried to
keep a running tally as White House negotiators worked to
find a compromise with Senate Democrats.
   Estimating costs is the easy part compared with the
benefits. Nobody favors pumping billions of tons of poison
into the air every year, but there is surprisingly little
consensus on how much harm this air pollution actually
causes. One of the few shreds of evidence cited in the
debate: a finding by the EPA that a subset of the toxic
chemicals covered by the legislation cause between 1,700 and
2,500 fatal cancer cases annually. The new law won't
eliminate all those cancers because it won't eliminate all
the pollution.
   EPA scientists say about 75% -- or between 1,100 and 2,000
-- of these deaths would be prevented if the bill were
enacted. John Graham, a professor of public health at Harvard
University, dissected the EPA analysis, differentiating
between studies that prove links to human cancer and those
that rely exclusively on animals. He concluded that 500 was a
more plausible number, but emphasizes the uncertainty. "The
true number could be zero. The higher bound might get as high
as 1,000," he says.
   Toxic chemicals in the air may also figure in birth
defects and in less serious cancers, but no reliable
estimates popped up during the Clean Air debate. The health
effects of living near a factory that spews toxic substances
into the air simply aren't fully understood. "You're relying
on statistical correlations," Mr. Dudek, the environmental
economist, acknowledges, "as opposed to understanding the
precise pathway through which a pollutant enters a person's
system and affects health."
   If the paucity of economic and scientific evidence on air
toxics is at one extreme in the Clean Air debate, acid rain
ought to be at the other. After all, it has been studied
intensively for more than a decade. Yet the debate over the
science and economics of combating acid rain remains intense.
   Even where there's a consensus on the surface, a heated
debate boils underneath. For instance, in estimating the cost
of cleaning up power plants, all sides to the debate rely on
a computer model of the coal and electric utility industry
that belongs to ICF Resources Inc., a Fairfax, Va.,
consulting firm. With detailed data on every power plant in
the country, it predicts how each plant would be affected by
the new law and how the coal industry would change as a
result.
   ICF says the acid-rain crackdown would cost around $4
billion a year, a clean-air surcharge on America's electric
bills averaging 2% or 3%. "It drives the debate," says Robert
Hahn, an American Enterprise Institute economist.
   But that doesn't mean that everyone actually believes the
output of the ICF model. Both Mr. Hahn and Mr. Dudek of the
Environmental Defense Fund contend the model doesn't fully
appreciate how the clean-air bill's innovative plan to allow
utilities to buy and sell the right to pollute would restrain
the eventual cost of the legislation.
   "It's the difference between a Polaroid and a video," says
Mr. Dudek. The ICF model is like a still photograph that
doesn't reflect the dynamics of the market that the new law
will create, he claims.
   Daniel Klein, senior vice president of ICF Resources,
disagrees. "The model handles this pretty easily," he says.
"All of the utilities are trying to meet their requirements
at least-cost. The model is looking at the options available
to each one," including trading pollution rights.
