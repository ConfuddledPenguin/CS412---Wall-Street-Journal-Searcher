   Houston -- The Astrodome here passed its 25th birthday
this year, and it would be nice if, sometime during the
annum, we each light a sparkler to mark it.
   I suggest a sparkler not only because it would be festive,
but also because the device has a place in Astrodome history.
In the indoor ballpark's earlier days, its humongous
electronic scoreboard would erupt into a lengthy and
excessive display every time a Houston Astro hit a home run.
This prompted some opposing players to light sparklers in
countercelebration of their teammates' four-baggers.

   The big scoreboard is gone, removed in a recent expansion
of the Dome's seating capacity. Gone, too, is the apartment
its creator, Judge Roy Hofheinz, maintained in the upper deck
behind right-center field, the presidential suite he built
for his pal, Lyndon B. Johnson (but which LBJ never
occupied), and the medieval-style chapel he installed in case
guests felt the need for prayer or meditation.
   The presidential suite was a special stunner. Designed by
Harper Goff, whose previous credits included sets for the
movie "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," it featured
chandeliers, statuary, a rug bearing the presidential seal,
and canopied twin beds covered in regal purple. Once asked if
the effect wasn't a bit gaudy, the late judge is said to have
replied, "Maybe, but you'll remember it, won't you?"
   Much the same thing can be said for the Astrodome as a
whole. You don't hear much about its being the "eighth wonder
of the world" anymore, now that Toronto and Montreal boast
indoor ballparks with roofs that retract, but the place's
place as a pacesetter will ever be secure. It was the first
domed and air-conditioned baseball-football stadium, the
first to sport an artificial playing surface, and the first
to have corporate "luxury suites." When Houston's
rank-and-file fans didn't rise up and murder their occupants,
the suites became the bedrock of new-stadium financing.
   "Whether you like it or not, we're in show business,"
declared the judge in 1965, when his brainchild opened. And
American sports have never been the same since.
   Judge Hofheinz, stout and bespectacled, was a prototypical
Texas politician-entrepreneur who titled his autobiography
"The Grand Huckster." He first envisaged an indoor stadium
for his sultry home town, a city of shiny skyscrapers and
shinier foreheads, after visiting the Colosseum in Rome and
learning that the structure once had a huge "velarium," or
awning, that could be unrolled in inclement weather.
   He discussed the matter with the architect Buckminster
Fuller, inventor of the geodesic dome, and came away
convinced "that it was possible to cover any size space if
you don't run out of money." The Astrodome cost $36.5
million, which was a lot then but not so much now; the
1988-89 remodeling job cost about $50 million.
   The Dome was a hit at first, drawing 2,151,470 spectators
to Astro games its initial season, triple the number of the
year before, and thousands more for tours to view its
splendors. Judge Hofheinz branched out on the site, building
convention facilities, hotels and an amusement park, all with
"Astro" in their names. His Astro-naming craze extended to an
early baseball program, which provided fans with space to
collect "Astrografs."
   Astromania would be shortlived. When the novelty of the
Dome wore off, Houston proved to be a tough-nut sports town,
and sellouts remain rare even for the pro-football Oilers. In
the middle 1970s, with seasonal baseball attendance below the
one million mark, the Hofheinz empire unraveled, and
creditors had to step in for a time and operate his
properties.
   The Dome's, and the Astros', current proprietor is the
Houston Sports Association, which leases the building from
Harris County. It books about 200 dates a year with things
like rodeos and tractor pulls in addition to baseball and
football, and usually runs close to breaking even, no small
achievement for an enterprise of its sort.
   "September baseball is our key -- if the Astros are
playing well, they'll draw enough people to put us in the
black," says Adam Richards, HSA's treasurer. Since the team's
second and last National League Western Division title, in
1986, they have, he adds.
   Withal, the Astrodome has stood up well during its first
quarter-century. Its seats for baseball, its main activity,
are comfortable and close to the field, and parking is
plentiful and cheap ($3). Dome management courts the family
trade by keeping the place tidy and leveling a close eye on
rowdies. "First, we ask 'em to hold it down, and if they
don't, we ask 'em to leave," notes Gary Weaver, one of the
building's red-jacketed security men.
   If there have been complaints about the building, they've
come mainly from ballplayers, not fans. Whatever else the
Astrodome may be, it's also the toughest park in the National
League in which to hit home runs. During the 1980s, just 702
batted balls cleared the fences here, fewer than half as many
as at Chicago's Wrigley Field, the league's most-generous
venue.
   "A lot of awfully hard-hit balls wind up as simple
fly-outs here. It can get really frustrating," says Glen
Davis, the reigning Astro strong boy, who has hit more homers
on the road than at home over his five-year career. His
theory is that sea-level Houston's hot and soggy summer air
overpowers the Dome's air-conditioning and stifles potential
round-trippers.
   It's been said that the Dome's cushioned seats and
decorous atmosphere, coupled with the prevailing
power-hitting failure, has created a laid-back local fandom
that's been less than an asset to Astro teams. "Some players
used to say it was more like a theater than a ballpark, and
that makes it tough to get up for games," notes Larry
Dierker, who pitched for the Astros for 14 years and now is
one of the team's broadcasters.
   He adds, "I never agreed with that view, but sure I
understood it. Heck, the place is more like a theater than a
ballpark."
