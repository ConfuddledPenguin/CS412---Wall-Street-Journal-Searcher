   Market-oriented foundations have spent tens of millions
dollars to advance the capitalist cause on university
campuses. Yet capitalism's largest investment in the
collegiate marketplace of ideas has yielded returns lower
than the shakiest grade of junk bond. That's because much of
the money has been donated to universities to establish
chairs of free enterprise and entrepreneurship -- and despite
the wealth of their endowments, these chairs are remarkably
ineffective.
   The first free-enterprise chair was founded at Georgia
State University in 1963; today, according to an April 1989
survey by Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, there are at
least 89 professorships in the U.S., as well as several whole
centers of private enterprise, instilling free enterprise and
entrepreneurship into the minds of students. Baylor
University in Waco, Texas, alone has eight. Chairs have been
created at a rate of eight to 10 a year since 1985. The
movement is world-wide; there are free-enterprise chairs in
the U.S., Canada, England and even India.

   Mr. Katz estimates that it costs between $1 million and
$2.5 million to endow a full-fledged chair of free enterprise
or entrepreneurship. (Named professorships cost less.) Some
donors have been even more generous. The Coleman Foundation
of Illinois, created from the profits of Fannie May Candies,
has endowed five chairs of entrepreneurship at colleges in
Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri. Frank Kenan, a North
Carolina trucking magnate, was so determined to create the
Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of
North Carolina (Chapel Hill) that he gave $8.5 million to the
university for a building and an additional $3 million for
the institute's budget.
   Nearly $100 million has been invested in endowing
free-enterprise and entrepreneurship chairs. While that's
small change for a major corporation, the same amount, if put
in one place, would create the wealthiest think tank in
America. (The Brookings Institution, whose riches are the
envy of its competitors, has an endowment of only about $85
million.)
   By affixing an aggressively ideological label to their
professorships, the founders of the "free enterprise" chairs
guaranteed that the chairholders would play a marginal role
on college campuses. Michael Mescon, the Georgia State
private-enterprise professor who originated the concept and
holds the very first of these chairs to be created (the
Bernard B. and Eugenia A. Ramsey Chair of Private
Enterprise), says that the free-enterprise name was chosen to
ensure that universities understood the ideologically
motivated nature of the donation: "Everything you do," Mr.
Mescon says, "you do right on top of the table and in broad
daylight." That's exactly why Milton Friedman opposes these
chairs. "I am opposed to chairs of free enterprise," Mr.
Friedman said in an interview, "as I am to chairs of
Marxism-Leninism or socialism."
   The ideological nature of free-enterprise chairs makes it
difficult to find qualified people to occupy them.
Twenty-four of the 89 chairs and professorships of free
enterprise or entrepreneurship counted by Jerome Katz were
unfilled. In part this is due to a problem of credentials; no
one offers doctorates in free enterprise or entrepreneurship.
But often the chairs are left empty while liberal university
presidents and donors complete their delicate and protracted
negotiations. At Trinity College in Connecticut it took five
years to appoint someone to the Shelby Cullom Davis Chair of
American Business and Economic Enterprise.
   On many campuses, however, there is little objection to
chairs of private enterprise or entrepreneurship for one
simple reason -- the chairholders do little that would annoy
anyone.
   Few holders of free-enterprise chairs conduct serious
scholarship. In a 1985 survey by the Baylor University Center
for Private Enterprise, 51% of the free-enterprise and
entrepreneurship chairholders surveyed said they placed
"extensive emphasis" on training elementary and high-school
teachers in economics; only 17% said they attached similar
importance to scholarship, equal to the number who said they
stressed the production of training manuals. Only 11 of the
51 papers presented at the 1989 annual meeting of the
Association for Private Enterprise Education were about
economics; the remainder were on business-related topics: how
entrepreneurs like independence and should be more creative.
   The activities of centers of private enterprise are also
oriented away from research. At Baylor University, Center for
Private Enterprise Director Calvin Kent is proudest of a
program, funded by a $200,000 grant from the Pew Charitable
Trusts, that encourages inner-city youths to be entrepreneurs
by introducing them to suitable role models. Rollie Tillman
Jr., director of the Kenan Institute for Private Enterprise,
promises that his institute will, in time, attach more
importance to original research, but says that his
organization's chief product at the moment is a series of
television interviews with H. Ross Perot, Mary Kay Ash and
Roger Horchow. "We've got a lot of input," Mr. Tillman says,
"but our output is just beginning." The institute is also the
headquarters of the National Entrepreneur Hall of Fame.
   At Beloit College in Wisconsin, Jerry Gustafson,
Coleman/Fannie May Professor of Entrepreneurship, who had
already been a tenured professor of economics at Beloit, says
that his course load has changed relatively little since his
chair was endowed in 1986. Mr. Gustafson uses the $1 million
invested in him by the Coleman Foundation to convince
students that self-employment is a pleasant notion. He hopes
to be able to award $2,000 to $2,500 start-up grants to
Beloit students who may wish to start their own companies,
and lobbies his colleagues to advise their students that
working for themselves is just as worthy as going to graduate
school. The Coleman Foundation, Mr. Gustafson says, "isn't
interested in being ideological at all. They're just trying
to present options rather than push an agenda."
   Certainly whispering the praises of capitalism or helping
poor people escape the ghetto are noble goals. But the
millions invested by free-enterprise chair donors have done
little to change the tone or nature of the debate over ideas
in American colleges and universities. Of what use is it, for
example, to pay a tenured economics professor's salary if a
college can use the money saved to pay for socialist
speakers? Frank Ellsworth, president of Pitzer College in
California reminds donors that of all forms of gifts to
colleges, an endowed chair "is the hardest mechanism for a
donor to control the outcome."
   The millionaires who endow free-enterprise chairs would
find their gifts put to better use at the dozens of
market-oriented think tanks. For the price of a
free-enterprise chair, a donor could pay for a year's budget
of a first-rate research organization, such as the Cato
Institute or the Manhattan Institute.
