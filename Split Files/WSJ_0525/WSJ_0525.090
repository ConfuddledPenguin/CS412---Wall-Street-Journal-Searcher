   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee unanimously
approved a bill that would give the Securities and Exchange
Commission substantially broader fining power and allow the
agency to shut down alleged securities-industry wrongdoers.
   The legislation also will give the SEC easier access to
grand-jury investigations in securities-law cases, a power
the SEC has sought since it found resources strapped by the
insider-trading cases of the mid- to late-1980s.

   The Senate version of the bill was amended prior to
committee approval to set stricter guidelines for the civil
fines, which would greatly expand the agency's enforcement
powers. The House hasn't moved far on its version of the
bill, which remains at the subcommittee level.
   Under the new system, a first tier sets a maximum of
$5,000 for each violation for individuals and $50,000 per
violation for brokerage firms and other entities for a range
of mostly inadvertent securities violations, such as late or
incorrect filings. The next tier sets maximums of $50,000 for
individuals and $250,000 for others if the violation involves
"fraud, deceipt, manipulation" or disregard for law. The
third level sets limits of $100,000 for individuals and
$500,000 for others if the second-tier criterion holds and
the violation "directly or indirectly resulted in substantial
losses."
   Currently, the SEC has the authority to impose fines for
insider-trading violations.
   The legislation approved by the panel allows the SEC to
order a brokerage firm or other entity regulated by the
agency to "cease and desist" from wrongdoing. That rule is
narrower than the earlier proposed legislation, which would
have allowed the SEC to take such unilateral action against a
corporation as well. Currently, the SEC must ask the courts
for a temporary injunction to stop such abuses.
   Under the bill's new authority, the SEC would still be
able to seek cease-and-desist authority over a corporate
violator if the company is provided with notice and an
opportunity for a hearing before the order is issued.
   The bill was tightened to relieve concerns that the SEC
would become too heavy-handed in its enforcement efforts. "We
have tried to address those concerns by clarifying the scope
of the bill in virtually every section," said Sen.
Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), who heads the securities
subcommittee.
   The bill also would allow courts to bar officers or
directors from serving in those capacities if they are found
to have violated anti-fraud laws. Earlier versions of the
bill granted that power to the SEC, but corporate groups
contended that the authority was too broad.
