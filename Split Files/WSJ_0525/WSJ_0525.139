   TOKYO -- Large growth in redemptions and claims as well as
financial instability drove down profits at Japan's nonlife
insurers in fiscal 1989.
   Interest-rate deregulation in Japan has led policy holders
in recent years to redeem annuities in favor of
higher-yielding bank deposits, resulting in lower investment
income and diminished assets as well as large payments. In
the fiscal year ended March 31, growth in investment income
was also depressed by instability in the Japanese financial
markets.

   To counter redemptions of annuities, the companies have
relied on growth in policies such as auto insurance for
business. An unusually high number of road accidents in the
year left all the companies exposed to large claims from
shareholders. Profits on insurance operations at the four
largest Japanese nonlife insurers fell sharply in the year.
   Those insurers are Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co.,
Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Taisho Marine &amp; Fire
Insurance Co. and Sumitomo Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co.
