named a new president to its Gerber Scientific Products Inc.
subsidiary, and formed a new wholly owned subsidiary to focus

   Gerber said Ronald Webster, a 30-year company veteran,
will replace David Logan as president of GSP, which makes
automation systems for the sign-making, graphic arts and
related industries.
   Mr. Logan, who joined Gerber in 1957 and founded GSP in
1980, has decided to retire, the company said. He will
continue to serve as a director and consultant to GSP and
Gerber Optical Inc., the new Gerber subsidiary.
   The company named Kenneth Wood, former head of Gerber's
optical division, as president of Gerber Optical. The
subsidiary, which aims to automate eyewear makers, was formed
from Mr. Wood's old division.
   In the fourth quarter, Gerber said it had a 1.3% gain in
sales, to $80.9 million from $79.9 million in the year-ago
period. But profit slipped to $8.3 million, or 35 cents a
share, from $9.1 million, or 38 cents a share on a greater
number of shares outstanding.
   For the fiscal year, Gerber posted a 2.6% sales gain, to
$307.2 million from $299.3 million in 1989. Profit fell
slightly, to $32.4 million from $32.9 million, but pershare
earnings rose one cent to $1.36 because of a 1.9% drop in
average shares outstanding.
