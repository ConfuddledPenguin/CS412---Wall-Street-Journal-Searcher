   NEW YORK -- As New York State thrashed out a desperately
late budget, school district treasurer Robert Finnerty
watched his carefully crafted safety net disintegrate.
   The seven-week-late budget marked the sixth consecutive
year the state missed its April 1 deadline -- forcing school
districts and towns to scramble for costly, short-term
borrowings and bruising the Empire State's credit rating.

   Mr. Finnerty, a 26-year veteran of Fairport Central School
District near Rochester, N.Y., took defensive action last
December: Fairport borrowed $2.5 million, invested it in
certificates of deposit to help "take the sting out" of the
loan's cost, and waited. The strategy allowed the school
district to meet its $2.4 million April payroll while others
flailed for funds.
   Now, Fairport has borrowed another $3 million to meet
expenses due yesterday.
   Even though state legislators agreed on the $49.8 billion
budget last week, it will be some time before state aid
checks are in the mail. And that has Mr. Finnerty concerned.
"I'm worried about the competition, since everyone is out in
the market at the same time looking for funds," he says. But
he's even more worried about the trickle-down impact that the
state's fiscal woes will have on its future, long-term
borrowing power.
   And well he should be, according to a recent
credit-quality workshop run by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the
rating concern that recently knocked New York State's debt
down a notch. S&amp;P and many economists note that the burden of
funding environmental, social and similar programs is
increasingly being passed down to the state and local level
by a federal government eager for spending cuts. The
buck-passing is expected to be especially difficult on
Northeastern states beleaguered by economic slowdown, stalled
property values and aging infrastructures.
   Meanwhile, many local governments find their borrowing
power weakening. For all of 1989, S&amp;P downgraded $24 billion
of municipal debt. But during the first quarter of 1990
alone, it downgraded $23.2 billion, largely because of New
York State issues.
   S&amp;P's workshop assembled top finance officers of New York,
New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, who told analysts,
bankers and a few local officials, often with grim humor,
about their pummeled budgets. "The real `miracle' in
Massachusetts is they haven't killed each other yet," says
Richard Larkin, a managing director in S&amp;P's municipal
finance department, in introducing the session.
   Many of the other 46 states have similar problems. S&amp;P
says California, Florida, and North Carolina may be next on
the endangered credit list.
   "You've got to start watching California," says Hyman
Grossman, managing director of S&amp;P's municipal department.
Mr. Grossman cited a steady slowdown in military spending
(most recently reflected in heavy layoffs at McDonnell
Douglas Corp.'s West Coast operations) as well as weakness in
commercial real estate. As for the Sunshine State, Mr.
Grossman says: "We have a real estate bust in Southeast
Florida."
   North Carolina suffers from a problem affecting many
budgets: a major gap in projected corporate tax revenue. But
S&amp;P says the gap was exacerbated by capital-gains tax
miscalculations related to the RJR Nabisco Inc. leveraged
buy-out, among other things.
   New York State holds center stage at the moment, as it
proposes $1.4 billion in new taxes in the state with the
third-lowest bond rating in the country. The New York State
comptroller estimates some $3 billion in late school aid cost
districts about $400,000 a day in interest payments, or about
$20 million over about 50 days. The best guess on when
overdue state aid payments will reach the school districts is
the week of June 11.
   New York City and Buffalo have had to seek bridge loans to
tide them over until state revenue is apportioned. The Big
Apple, which faces a $105 million revenue gap of its own,
says borrowing because of the state's tardiness could cost it
$23 million in interest and other costs.
   In general, state credit ratings will be more difficult to
maintain; some 37 states expect revenue shortages in fiscal
1990. Meanwhile, the states are loath to raise taxes in this
election year. Still, Cathy Daicoff, a managing director in
S&amp;P's municipal finance department, interprets President
Bush's famous "lips" speech this way for the states: "Read my
lips: Raise your taxes."
   Of course, there are those who feel tax increases are
unconscionable, considering already-bloated levies and
laissez-faire administration. Chief among them is Martin
Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford Univeristy.
   Mr. Anderson points out that both state and federal
revenues have continued to gush in at higher levels, year
after year. "The problem is they're just spending too much,"
Mr. Anderson says.
   Mickey Levy, chief economist of First Fidelity Bancorp.,
notes that the Eastern states are experiencing the same kind
of "restructuring" that has already happened in places like
the Midwest and Texas. While he stops short of forecasting
recession, Mr. Levy does see sluggishness in several
industries that requires reduced expectations. "In a sense,
elected officials on the East Coast are going through the
same kind of adjustments bankers are," he says.
   And Douglas C. Berman, New Jersey's treasurer, adds: "We
will never see the growth rates of 1983-87." With smaller
annual growth and larger infrastructure and social needs,
where will the revenues come from? "My guess is property
taxes are going up," he says. And "you will see a greater use
of state authorities," such as the turnpike office.
   Paring spending while shoring up creditworthiness may
sound simplistic, but it is exactly the point made repeatedly
at the S&amp;P workshop. "Credit ratings can be improved by
economic managers of these states," says S&amp;P's Mr Larkin. "A
lot of states have taken us up on establishing some kind of
`rainy day' fund. That's one thing I can't stress enough,"
says Mr. Larkin.
   That message isn't much help to troubled states that
drained their rainy-day funds some time ago. And it's no help
at all to Schroon, N.Y., and its frugal officials such as
John Kelly, town supervisor. Schroon, a self-professed "Town
of Recreational Beauty" in the Adirondacks with its own
nine-mile lake, has been bracing for a $1.5 million,
state-ordered closing of its landfill.
   "The states mandate a lot of things, but they don't put
their money where their mouth is," says Mr. Kelly. The town
(population: 1,650; annual budget $1,849,872) hasn't borrowed
any money to speak of since 1973, when it installed a public
sewer system. Mr. Kelly's been more than a little concerned
about the high cost of funds needed for the landfill closing.
So "we've been squirreling away money for the last five
years" in the general and water department funds, he says.
   So far, the town has saved about $289,000. But in
mid-April, Schroon got a letter from the state comptroller's
office noting the town has "no statutory authority for the
accumulation of excessive fund balances." The comptroller
suggested Schroon think about lowering its taxes.
