   LONDON -- New U.K. economic data showed a continued rise
in industrial production against a background of steady wage
increases in manufacturing, reinforcing economists' views
that the Thatcher government is having mixed success in
cooling the economy.
   The Central Statistical Office reported industrial
production rose 1.8% in March from month-earlier levels,
while rising 1.7% from March 1989. In addition, unit wage
costs in the manufacturing sector, while easing 0.3% in March
from February, were up 7.5% from the year-earlier month.

   The data come on top of a wider-than-expected April
merchandise trade deficit of 1.78 billion pounds ($3.01
billion), reported Wednesday.
   "One month ago, we had tentative signs" of a slowdown in
economic activity that could lead to lower inflation, says
David Owen, economist at Kleinwort Benson Securities. Now, he
says, that optimism appears to have been misplaced.
   A Treasury official noted that the year-on-year rise in
industrial production showed that the "rate of growth has
clearly slowed over the past year," as expected in the
current fiscal climate.
   But the market was anticipating a rise in industrial
production of only about 0.45%. The higher-than-expected rise
led many economists to revise next week's first-quarter
output-based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures upward to
stand even with quarter-earlier levels or to show a modest
gain.
   GDP in the fourth quarter was up 2% -- from a year
earlier. Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major has forecast
that GDP growth would be 1% for 1990.
   Although unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector
showed a modest fall in March, UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew Ltd.
economist Joe Roseman notes that wage settlements are still
running at an "uncomfortably high level" on an annualized
basis, putting considerable pressure on profit margins.
   The squeeze on profits has led to some employment
contraction in the manufacturing sector, which economists say
may shortly lead to lower wage demands. But they add that
this has yet to be felt in the service sector, where the wage
problem is exacerbated by an acute shortage of skilled labor.
   Mr. Roseman and other economists take comfort from the
historical pattern of high wage settlements of the early
1980s and early 1986, which were followed by sharp falls in
pay settlements. But these also suggest that any sudden
shakeouts in the labor market can't be expected in 1990.
