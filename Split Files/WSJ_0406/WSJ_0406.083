   BORLANGE, Sweden -- Drinking alone at the Saga Nightclub,
Charlotte Eriksson drifts back to her days as a living
legend.
   "As soon as American guys heard I was Swedish, you could
read their minds," says the 19-year-old drama student, who
spent three of her teen-age years in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
"They expected me to leap right into their bed. That, or leap
out the window and kill myself."

   Tapping her foot to the music, Ms. Eriksson scans the bar
for possible dance partners. "Sometimes," she sighs, going
back to her beer, "I wish Sweden was as thrilling as its
reputation."
   In the beginning, Odin and Frigg begat Thor -- and
Scandinavia begat myths that have multiplied ever since. With
the Norse gods came Vikings: fierce men in bear furs, prone
to rape and pillage. Gradually, the Nordic image thawed,
spawning new emblems. Norway has fiords. The Danish have
pastries. Sweden has suicide and sin.
   "I imagined beautiful blondes climbing all over me as soon
as I got off the airplane," says Michael Rosenblum, a New
York television producer now working in Stockholm. "What a
joke] A lot of them aren't even blond."
   Staring glumly at the cold crayfish on his dinner plate,
he adds: "You can see why they kill themselves. This is the
most boring, depressing place I've ever been."
   Swedes themselves are uneasy with their image, which they
blame on the movies. People see Max von Sydow playing chess
with Death in "The Seventh Seal." They recall the soft-core
porn film "I Am Curious Yellow." They remember Greta Garbo
and Ingrid Bergman. They think Swedes are like their movie
stars. Well, yes and no.
   Separating fact and fiction takes some doing. It is true,
for instance, that most native Swedes are blond. Swedes in
large numbers also are good-looking, though obviously that is
subjective. (Many Swedish men find Norwegian women more
appealing.) And Swedes, generally speaking, have very
permissive attitudes toward birth control, premarital sex and
unmarried couples living together.
   "Blondes don't have more fun," says Nina Yderberg a
Stockholm medical student, who is tall, blond and stunning.
She recently got so bored with her love life that she wrote a
magazine piece maintaining that "Swedish men are such bad
lovers, I'd rather sleep with women." The article, which
includes unflattering samples of male pillow talk, has
brought the 25-year-old a lot of attention, none of it
amorous. "I haven't even kissed a man in months," she says.
   Sex isn't the only thing that Swedes complain is
overrated. Young people in particular gripe that their
bureaucratic social-welfare society is over-engineered -- a
sort of Volvo writ large: safe, staid, the ultimate family
vehicle. And many speak enviously of the excitements to be
had abroad, where people are less formal and the night life
more exciting.
   "This country is cold and gray, and I'm not just talking
about the weather," says sex therapist Malena Ivrsson, who is
married to a Yugoslav. Adds writer and social critic Jan
Myrdal: "We're almost irrationally rational. It's hard to get
an emotional response from a Swede."
   Television host Robert Aschberg agrees. He recently
invited nudists and anti-nudists to appear together on his
show. The nudists disrobed and, to spice the debate, he asked
the anti-nudists to do as much themselves. They did. Mr.
Aschberg thought the program would cause a stir. It didn't.
   "Nine people stark-naked on TV, and no one cared," he
says. "Not one angry letter or phone call. Nothing."
   In summer, Swedish women routinely go topless at beach and
pool, as do women elsewhere in Europe. But contrary to some
visitors' expectations, strip clubs and sex shops in
Stockholm are rare and discreet -- no competition for
Amsterdam or Copenhagen, tame compared to New York.
Prostitutes are almost demure. Eva, a 24-year-old making the
rounds of a park near Stockholm's Opera, tries to lure a
foreign visitor by representing herself as "a Swedish sex
machine." But dressed in denims, a windbreaker and Reeboks,
she looks more like a gym teacher than a Toulouse-Lautrec
lady of the evening.
   "Swedish men don't want you looking like a prostitute,"
she explains. "Anyway, I'd freeze in hot pants and halter
top." Asked to describe her clients, she responds, "Your
basic Swedish meatballs. Polite, efficient, no passion --
same as out of bed."
   Swedish levelheadedness extends to, and flows from, social
policy. Sweden was the first country to introduce sex
education in schools. Contraception is freely available to
teen-agers, without parental consent. And teen-agers often
bring friends home to bed, even when parents are on the
premises.
   "Most parents feel this is better than having their
children freeze in cars or parks," says Katarina Lindahl, who
heads Sweden's National Association for Sexual Information.
   The permissiveness doesn't seem to encourage promiscuity.
A 1988 survey asked Swedes 16 to 23 years of age to name the
most important thing in relationships. Only 1% cited "good
sexual relations." In part because of contraception, rates of
teen-age pregnancy are comparatively low, and falling. A
survey of Swedish women 20 to 30 found that they had, on
average, five sex partners in their entire lives.
   But the news hasn't made it abroad. During a recent trip
to London, 19-year-old Lotta Strand was asked by a British
man to record a message for his answering machine. He thought
her Swedish accent would "sound sexy," she says.
   Ms. Strand, who lives in Stockholm, refused. And she has a
new way of warding off unwanted advances from foreign men. "I
tell them I'm from Iceland," she says. "Saying you're Swedish
is suicide."
   An apt image, some would suggest. Sweden, particularly in
winter, seems a stage set for suicide. The country has long,
dark, snowy winters that keep people indoors, often with a
bottle of aquavit to keep them company.
   Swedes, reserved around strangers, can indeed seem gloomy.
"Our national character is best described as Lutheran
melancholia," says Lars Hellsten, a teacher of literature and
philosophy. "The real question," he adds, with a smile, "is
why don't all Swedes kill themselves?"
   Actually, not a remarkable number do. In 1987, Sweden's
suicide rate was 18.4 per 100,000 people, which is about par
for industrialized countries. The U.S. rate was a relatively
low 12.7. Hungarians do themselves in at twice the rate of
Swedes.
   Historians say that Sweden's undeserved reputation began
with a speech by President Eisenhower at the 1960 Republican
National Convention in which he referred to a socialist
country in the north where "suicide has gone up almost
unbelievably." He was trying to discredit Sweden's welfare
state, and the suicide myth has survived ever since, with
evident help from Ingmar Bergman, the writer and director of
depressing movies.
   So what is the true Swedish vice?
   "We don't have one, that's the problem," says Anders
Sjogren, a business consultant and part-time therapist.
"We're so busy being reliable and boring that we don't have
time for sin."
   Speaking for himself, Mr. Sjogren thinks he knows of an
antidote to ennui. "I hear California girls are really
something," he says. "Maybe I'll go there someday, learn to
surf, meet a blonde."
