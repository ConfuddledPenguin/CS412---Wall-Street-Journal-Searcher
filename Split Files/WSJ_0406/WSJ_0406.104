   NEW YORK -- Small investors suddenly are welcome at one of
Wall Street's white-shoe investment banks.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., after long catering to the rich,
plans to launch its first stock mutual fund that woos the
little guy. Through the years, Goldman typically has required
that individuals looking to invest with the firm put up at
least $5 million.

   The minimum for its new GS Capital Growth Fund? A mere
$1,200.
   The planned offering hammers home just how bad times are
on Wall Street, analysts say. With nearly every segment of
the securities industry in the doldrums, firms are scraping
for any way to drum up steady income. And managing
mutual-fund assets generates fees based on the amount of
assets under management; those fees pour in even in slow
markets.
   "They go out and do a good deed and make a pile of money
for Goldman," says James Hanbury, a financial-services
analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. Right now, on Wall Street,
asset management "is the world's best business," he says.
   Goldman is mum on its change of heart, saying it can't
discuss the fund while the offering documents are being
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
haven't yet been approved.
   In papers filed with the SEC, Goldman said the fund will
stress long-term growth through so-called value investing --
trying to find underpriced securities.
   But the fund clearly won't be for shrinking violets. It
will be able to invest in a wide range of securities,
including foreign stocks and debt, junk bonds, restricted
stock, and shares of small, fledgling companies. However, no
more than 25% of the fund's assets can be invested in foreign
stocks and bonds. The overseas markets most likely to be
tapped include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan,
Switzerland, Britain and West Germany, the document says.
   And it won't come cheap. Investors will be levied a
maximum sales charge of 5.5% of the amount invested when
buying fund shares -- relatively high for a mutual fund.
Moreover, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the fund's adviser,
will get a steep annual management fee equal to 1% of the
fund's average daily net asset value.
   "Such {a} fee is higher than that paid by most investment
companies," notes Goldman's registration document; many
mutual funds levy annual management fees of 0.5% of assets.
   Goldman fund investors also will be charged an annual
"distribution" fee of as much as 0.25% of assets, according
to registration papers.
   Leon Cooperman, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management
and chief portfolio manager of the planned fund, declined to
comment.
   Notwithstanding the heavy charges, Goldman boasts one of
the best long-term stock-picking records in the securities
business.
   In the 12 months ended Dec. 31, Goldman ranked third out
of 10 securities firms regularly tracked by this newspaper,
with an estimated return of 37.1%. That eclipsed the 31.7%
return for the Standard &amp; Poor's-500 stock index last year,
according to the joint study by this newspaper and Zacks
Investment Research Inc. And for the 42 months ended Dec. 31,
Goldman topped all the other securities firms, just beating
out Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. with an estimated return
of 81.9%.
   In 1989's fourth quarter, the latest period available,
investors following Goldman's stock picking advice lost 2.4%,
Zacks said.
