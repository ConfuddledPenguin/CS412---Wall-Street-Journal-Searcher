   The 10-year spending required to close down insolvent
thrifts, an outlay that was estimated last year by the Bush
administration at $157.6 billion, is now considered certain
by federal budget analysts, economists and thrift executives
to wind up costing at least twice that amount, even without
any new losses among moribund savings and loan associations.
   The new estimates leave a funding gap of $100 billion to
$200 billion that will need to be addressed by the
administration and Congress in about two years. It could, at
that time, lead to attempts to tap the deposit insurance fund
of the commercial banking industry and the earnings of the
federal home loan banks owned by thrifts, and to additional
onerous insurance premiums to be paid by thrifts. But
taxpayers are still expected to bear the main brunt.

   The federal Resolution Trust Corp., charged with disposing
of insolvent S&amp;Ls, may defer the impact by selling its least
costly wards first, delaying the sale of the most expensive
failed thrifts. But informed economists and federal analysts
say the new cost estimates are realistic, and the money will
eventually have to paid be out.
   Over the long term, thrift experts say, the soaring
financing requirements of the thrift debacle will keep
interest rates relatively high, and wipe out much of any
"peace dividend" from cuts in defense spending.
   Thrift regulators have been hinting heavily for the past
two months that the $50 billion provided by passage of the
thrift-rescue legislation last August to cover net losses
from S&amp;L closings would be insufficient. William Seidman,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., provided
figures in congressional testimony indicating that, even if
future resolution costs were fairly low, an unexpected jump
in the number of insolvent thrifts is apt to increase
anticipated net losses by roughly 50%.
   But certain boomerang effects of the bill itself,
increased borrowing expenses and other events since last
August, completely apart from the increase in insolvencies,
have been driving up the projected cleanup costs. Moreover,
the original administration estimate was based on unrealistic
assumptions, and was confusing in that it excluded off-budget
expenses.
   "Those numbers were contrived," one government analyst
said.
   It is believed that agencies such as the Congressional
Budget Office and the General Accounting Office may soon
submit official projections that the actual 10-year spending
will end up in the $300 billion-to-$350 billion range, before
factoring in increased net losses from an unexpectedly
greater number of insolvencies. If net losses increase to $80
billion to $120 billion, considered a minimum range by thrift
economists such as James Barth, former chief economist for
the Office of Thrift Supervision, financing requirements will
drive total spending over 10 years far past the $400 billion
mark. At the end of 10 years, taxpayers would still have to
pay interest on $80 billion to $120 billion of debt over the
subsequent 20 to 30 years.
   The Bush administration originally estimated that it would
need to raise about $197 billion from thrifts, the Federal
Home Loan Bank system and the Treasury from 1989 to 1999 to
pay for anticipated costs of the thrift cleanup, although
only $157.6 billion was considered "on budget." About $59
billion would be used to pay for S&amp;Ls closed before 1989, $50
billion for current and imminent failures, and nearly $33
billion to pay for cases after 1991 and to establish a new
deposit insurance fund for thrifts. The remainder would go to
pay administrative expenses, and principal and interest on
various forms of debt.
   About half the spending was supposed to be funded by the
Treasury, with the rest of the money coming from off-budget
borrowings, insurance premiums from the thrift industry and
the sale of seized assets.
   The biggest need for additional spending comes from the
failure of the RTC to attract buyers for whole thrifts,
partly because the 1989 thrift legislation made such
investments unattractive. So the RTC has essentially been
liquidating S&amp;Ls, by keeping the bad assets and selling what
is left at enormous losses. In its first 50 resolutions, the
RTC's estimated cash outlays amounted to 75% of total assets,
and expected net losses to 47%, according to figures it has
supplied Congress.
   To finance this retention of bad assets, the RTC is going
to need $50 billion or more of additional borrowings, or
working capital. The original estimate of the cleanup costs
didn't include the interest on this working capital-interest
that is likely to reach $40 billion or more over the next
decade.
   Moreover, a Federal Deposit Insurance Fund official
testified before Congress this week that "we are not
optimistic" that the costs projected to cover S&amp;Ls seized
before 1989 "accurately reflect the size of the obligations."
Several other outlays, such as actual administrative
expenses, are expected to be far higher than estimated by the
government.
   Compounding the problem of higher cash outlays is a
shortage in cash income. The administration assumed S&amp;L
deposits would grow 7% a year over the period, pushing up
insurance premium receipts by $12 billion. The thrift
industry's deposit base is instead narrowing sharply, partly
because solvent S&amp;Ls are shrinking to meet higher capital
ratios imposed by the thrift bill, and partly because the RTC
is selling deposits of seized S&amp;Ls to commercial banks.
Government and thrift analysts now expect little or no net
deposit growth through 1999. The analysts also consider the
expected recovery rate on the sale of seized assets to be
markedly lower than the rate projected by the administration,
threatening an additional $22 billion of expected income.
   "The shortfall is monumental and signals the need for
Congress to revisit the funding issue," Mr. Barth and another
former government thrift economist, R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr.,
write in an unpublished paper prepared for the Stanford Law
and Policy Review.
