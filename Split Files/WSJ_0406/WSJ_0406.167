   NEW YORK -- The dollar and mark slid against the yen on
further squaring of long dollar positions against the
Japanese unit ahead of the Group of Seven industrial nations
meeting tomorrow in Paris.
   The dollar finished generally softer against other major
currencies in trading that grew so narrow in the U.S. that
one dealer was even reluctant to describe it as moving within
ranges.

   New York traders had walked into a trap Wednesday, buying
dollars on rumors of financial difficulties at Japanese
securities houses and expectations of another plunge in the
Tokyo stock market, said Dan Brooks, chief dealer at Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd. in New York. When the Japanese didn't follow
through by pushing the dollar up early yesterday, the New
York dealers had to dump their dollars, he said.
   Tokyo traders gave the yen a strong boost even during
their morning activity, despite a decline of 1,088.94 points
in the Nikkei stock index during the morning. The index
finished the day down 193.88 points, at 28,249.06.
   Traders in Tokyo, where most of the U.S. unit's slide
occurred yesterday, also attributed the yen's advance to
growing sentiment that a correction is under way after the
dollar's recent surge to 160 yen.
   The market is watching closely for signs that the trend
has turned, said Christa Bleyleben, vice president at the
Bank of Boston in Boston. Dealers aren't sure what might
emerge from the U.S.-Japanese trade talks in Washington this
week and from the G-7 meeting, she said. "If in doubt, be
careful."
   And after the U.S. unit's surge from the mid-140-yen level
in February to 160 yen this week, she said participants are
taking profits.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6995 marks, unchanged from late Wednesday, and at 157.40
yen, down from 158.95 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was quoted
at $1.6422, up from $1.6401 Wednesday.
   The dollar opened in Tokyo Friday at 156.90 yen, down from
the close in Tokyo Thursday of 157.90 yen.
   Many dealers said it will be difficult for the G-7 to
agree on a means to prop up the yen, particularly because of
doubts about the risks in the two most likely tools to do so.
Recent intervention hasn't succeeded and a Japanese
interest-rate increase could jolt Tokyo stock markets
further.
   Jack Griffin, assistant vice president and corporate
trader at Banque Indosuez in New York, said the currency
market is especially jittery ahead of the G-7 meeting because
of recent events. He cited Germany's unification and
nervousness in Japanese markets.
   Dai-Ichi's Mr. Brooks said he expects the G-7 to agree on
intervention to show unity. He added that if nothing else
changes, the market will view central bank dollar sales as an
opportunity to buy dollars at a lower price.
   And Mr. Griffin said that there is some speculation in the
market about central bank intervention that would involve
mark sales against yen rather than just the more common
dollar sales.
   The mark slid to 92.66 yen in late New York trading from
93.49 yen late Wednesday.
   The dollar finished mixed in Tokyo. The U.S. unit ended at
157.90 yen, down from 158.90 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo, and
it ended at 1.7008 marks yesterday in Tokyo, up from 1.6971
marks the day before.
   The dollar ended European dealing generally steady against
the major currencies, although the U.S. unit skidded
moderately lower against the yen.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery dropped $2.30 to $374.80 an ounce in moderate
trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.
   In Hong Kong, gold opened Friday at $378.25 an ounce.
