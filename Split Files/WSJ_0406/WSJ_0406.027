   BEIJING -- When Chinese Premier Li Peng gives a news
conference, the questions journalists pose often generate
more interest than Mr. Li's answers.
   Mr. Li repeatedly retreated to blandness or non-answers
when treading on controversial ground as he fielded questions
from foreign and Chinese reporters after the annual National
People's Congress. Chinese viewing the broadcast got an
earful nevertheless as the international media put the
premier on the spot, asking the questions most citizens here
wouldn't dare utter.

   "One assumes that China's leaders won't give satisfactory
answers," says Andrew Higgins, Beijing correspondent for the
Independent, a British daily. "So what matters is simply
asking tough questions."
   It's a role that foreign journalists took on here after
most Chinese were cowed into silence by the violent
suppression of last year's pro-democracy movement. By raising
tough questions as they do in the West, foreign journalists
often disclose to the Chinese masses controversial facts that
China's state-controlled media studiously avoid.
   For example, a Hong Kong reporter asked Mr. Li's reaction
to news that a leader of last year's student demonstrations
had escaped to the West. Mr. Li shrugged off the question,
but it was the first time Chinese around the country watching
the broadcast had heard that one of the country's most-wanted
"criminals" had evaded China's security apparatus and escaped
overseas.
   The Chinese also learn of taboo topics from the
Chinese-language broadcasts of Voice of America and the BBC.
But since June, the authorities frequently have jammed the
broadcasts. But almost everyone has access to a television,
and they tune in faithfully when the leaders meet the press.
   Given the embarrassing leaks, why doesn't the government
ban foreign journalists from the televised conferences? A
Chinese intellectual explains that, despite the unwelcome
questioning, the presence of foreign journalists lends an air
of credibility and legitimacy to the proceedings, and helps
reinforce the idea that China is an open society.
   "It's an uncomfortable trade-off," says the scholar. "But
it gives the Chinese leaders enormous `face' to have the
Western media eagerly participating in their political
theatrics."
   On Wednesday, foreign journalists threw a number of tough
questions to the premier. Among them: Does Mr. Li have any
regrets for last year's killings? (No.) Will China's leaders
keep Tiananmen Square open to the public, despite fears of
renewed protests? (Unclear.) Will ousted Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang ever make a political comeback? (Unlikely.)
   Mr. Li dodged specifics. When asked which leader gave the
order to open fire on demonstrators in Beijing last June 3-4,
he ducked the question, saying only, "There was no other
choice but to use force to stop the turmoil." When another
Western journalist repeated the question, Mr. Li dismissed it
with obvious pique, saying, "I've already answered that."
   Despite the evasions, many Chinese eagerly watched the
broadcast. "The Chinese people's spirits have been very low
recently," said a government worker after the telecast. "But
hearing journalists ask so many sensitive questions certainly
stirs up a lot of people."
   Indeed, foreign reporters frequently meet Chinese who
recognize them from televised news conferences. Many praise
the journalists for raising controversial questions. But such
attention puts journalists in an ethically awkward position:
their goal is to report the news objectively, not be drawn
into the Chinese political debate.
   By contrast, journalists for China's tightly controlled
press pose only the softest of questions. Some appeared
prearranged to let Mr. Li make points. Others were
super-cautious.
   In one, a People's Liberation Daily reporter waxed
emotional about the military's constitutional duty to
suppress unrest such as the Tiananmen protests. When he
finished his impassioned question, Mr. Li was speechless for
a time.
   "You have made a correct and comprehensive analysis of the
constitution," said Mr. Li, a hard-liner who is thought to
have played a leading role in the suppression of the
protests. "I have nothing to add."
   To his credit, Mr. Li did solicit questions from many
Western reporters. And, while offering little new
information, he handled the questions with confidence.
   When foreign journalists asked questions about the June
killings -- still the central issue to many Chinese -- Mr. Li
dismissed them as irrelevant:
   "It's nearly a year after the June 4 events," he said. "I
wonder if this question isn't a little outdated."
