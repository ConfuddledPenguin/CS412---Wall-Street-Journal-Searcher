   Emerge Magazine, a recent startup aimed at upscale black
readers, named Time Warner Inc. executive Donald Anderson as
publisher and chief executive officer.
   Robert L. Johnson, chairman of Emerge Inc., said he sought
Mr. Anderson to strengthen the marketing and advertising
sales effort of the magazine, a newsmonthly with analysis of
issues from a black perspective.

   Mr. Johnson said he was pleased with initial advertising
support for the six-month-old magazine and its unaudited paid
circulation figure of 150,000. But he said Emerge doesn't
stand out sufficiently from the handful of national black
magazines including Ebony, Essence and Black Enterprise. "The
thing it has not done to distinguish itself is to give the
reader a sense of being on top of issues that impact black
America and providing some learned analysis -- that's what's
missing in our {black} publications," Mr. Johnson said.
   Washington communications lawyer Tyrone Brown had been
serving as publisher on a caretaker basis, Mr. Johnson said.
He added that he hopes the magazine will break even in three
years.
   Mr. Anderson, a 16-year veteran of Time Warner's Home Box
Office unit, has been quietly instrumental in linking the
media giant with black-communications ventures. In 1985, he
helped convince HBO to take a stake in Mr. Johnson's then
ailing Black Entertainment Television (BET) cable service and
spent four years overseeing BET's sales and marketing. BET's
subscriber base rose from seven million to 23 million in the
period. Mr. Anderson was also a mentor to Wilmer Ames, a
former Time magazine researcher who sought backing to start
Emerge in 1988.
   While Mr. Anderson's positions with Emerge were called
permanent, and he was elected to the board, Time Warner will
pay his salary and he will remain officially part of Time
Warner's staff.
   "He's a long-termer here and he's done a lot of good
things here," said Christopher Meigher III, executive vice
president of the Time magazine group, of the unusual
arrangement. BET is Emerge's largest holder with 35%; Time
Warner holds about 17%.
   "The upscale black community is excited about us. But we
have to speak more clearly to the advertising community," Mr.
Anderson said. "We have to clearly demonstrate that our
editorial delivers the demographic that's not currently being
served by other black publications. To do that we must live
up to our mission to be a news monthly."
   Audrey Edwards, executive editor of Black Enterprise
Magazine, said she welcomed Emerge in the ranks of competing
black magazines because fewer than 10 of the 1,275 national
consumer magazines are black-oriented. Nevertheless, Ms.
Edwards, formerly an editor with Ms. and Essence magazines,
said it can be difficult for a monthly magazine to handle
news on a timely basis.
