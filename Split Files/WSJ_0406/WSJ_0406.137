   DALLAS -- The former chairman and chief executive officer
of the defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association was
sentenced to 30 years in federal prison, one of the stiffest
sentences to date in thrift-related fraud prosecutions.
   Woody F. Lemons, the seventh officer of Vernon to be
convicted, was found guilty in December of 13 charges brought
as a result of a continuing investigation by the U.S. Justice
Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.

   The 30-year sentence, which stunned defense lawyers and
elated government attorneys, came less than a week before the
House Banking Committee is scheduled to hold hearings in
Dallas on the effectiveness of prosecution in fraud-related
thrift failures, such as Vernon's.
   The Justice Department has been investigating Vernon's
lending practices since 1986 but has yet to bring criminal
charges against the thrift's former owner, Don R. Dixon. The
banking committee has invited Mr. Dixon to testify next week
but his attorney, William M. Ravkind of Dallas, said his
client won't appear. Mr. Ravkind called Mr. Lemons's 30-year
sentence "absurd."
   In view of the scheduled hearings, Mr. Lemons's defense
lawyer, Michael P. Gibson of Dallas, had urged U.S. District
Judge Robert B. Maloney to be mindful of the prosecutors'
"trophy mentality."
   "Mr. Lemons is the trophy for the federal agencies because
they need to maintain their position that they're out there
doing good for the community," Mr. Gibson said.
   But Judge Maloney, who has presided in at least two other
criminal cases related to Vernon Savings, referred to Mr.
Lemons as "a thief in every sense of the word" and said he
wanted to use the sentence "to assure the public" that thrift
fraud won't be treated lightly.
   Mr. Gibson called the 30-year sentence "way
disproportionate to the crime." Mr. Lemons was convicted of
bank fraud and 12 other charges, including a charge that he
accepted a $212,000 kickback from the proceeds of a $46
million real estate development loan.
   Judge Maloney didn't impose a fine but will rule later
this month on how much restitution Mr. Lemons will be ordered
to make. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is seeking $9
million to $10 million, according to Howard Feinstein, chief
of the conflicts and restitution unit of the FDIC's legal
staff.
   The FDIC is taking a stronger role in criminal cases, as
evidenced by a letter from FDIC Chairman William Seidman to
Judge Maloney.
   "Woody Lemons abused his position of trust and defrauded
the institution, causing damages of over $18 million," Mr.
Seidman wrote earlier this week. "While I have considered the
fact that Mr. Lemons has a family, I have also taken into
consideration . . . that virtually all the costs of Mr.
Lemons's criminal acts will be borne by the {thrift}
resolution fund and, ultimately, the U.S. taxpayers."
   Vernon was closed in November 1987 by the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., which found a stunning 96% of the
thrift's loans in default. The FSLIC committed $1.3 billion
to fold the thrift's assets into Montfort Savings
Association, which became part of First Gibraltar Bank in
late December 1988.
