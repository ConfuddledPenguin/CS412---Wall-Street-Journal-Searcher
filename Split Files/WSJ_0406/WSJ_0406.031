   WALTHAM, Mass. -- Cabot Corp. said it will buy all the
assets of American Optical Corp.'s AO Safety division in an
outright purchase by Cabot, instead of its previous plan to
have partial ownership of AO Safety through a joint venture.
   Terms of the new transaction, which is expected to be
completed later this month, weren't disclosed.

   Cabot said it will merge AO Safety with Cabot's E-A-R
noise control and hearing protection business into a wholly
owned subsidiary, which is expected to have combined annual
revenue of about $200 million. AO Safety makes safety
eyeware, respirators and other safety products.
   Previously, Cabot had said it would form a limited
partnership with a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. that
was going to acquire AO Safety from American Optical. In
addition, Cabot was going to contribute its E-A-R business to
the partnership. From that transaction, Cabot would have
received $100 million in cash and $30 million in securities,
plus a "significant" minority interest in the partnership.
   Cabot Chairman Samuel Bodman said, "As a result of certain
strategic and financial developments, we decided it was in
the best interest of Cabot to structure the transaction as an
outright purchase. This will have a positive impact on
earnings and provide more flexibility for financing in the
future."
   American Optical is based in Southbridge, Mass.
