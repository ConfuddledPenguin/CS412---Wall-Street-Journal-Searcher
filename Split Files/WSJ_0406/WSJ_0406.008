   PARIS -- Cerus SA, a holding company headed by Italian
financier Carlo De Benedetti, declined to comment on a news
report that it is near a sale of its 15.4% stake in Societe
Generale de Belgique S.A.
   In the past, Cerus has sometimes scoffed at such reports.
Meanwhile, a financial executive familiar with the situation
suggested Mr. De Benedetti might be willing to take a loss on
the sale of the shares under certain circumstances.

   The report, in the Belgian daily Echo de la Bourse,
suggested Cerus might sell the shares in three blocks,
perhaps to Japanese and German buyers.
   Cerus bought the shares during a failed 1988 battle to win
control of SGB, a sprawling holding company for Belgian
industrial and financial interests. The battle ended with
Cie. Financiere de Suez of France gaining 51% of SGB. Since
then, Cerus has said it was interested in selling its stake
eventually. It has assumed, however, that Cerus would be very
hesitant to sell for less than the average of about 3,500
Belgian francs ($99) a share that it paid in 1988.
   On the Brussels Bourse yesterday, SGB closed at 3,320
Belgian francs a share, down 20. At the latest closing price,
Cerus's stake is valued at the equivalent of about $935
million.
