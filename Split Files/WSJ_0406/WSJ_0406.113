   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Hilton Hotels Corp., regrouping
after its assets-sale plan derailed, expects to report that
earnings rose approximately 90% to about $25 million, or from
50 to 52 cents a share, in the first quarter.
   In the year-earlier period, the company had net income of
$13.1 million, or 27 cents a share. Revenue is expected to be
about $264 million, compared with $225.1 million reported a
year ago.

   In his first interview since the hotel-casino concern
scrapped its auction last month, Barron Hilton, chairman and
chief executive officer, said he's "very enthusiastic" about
developing the company's core businesses. "We weren't going
to accept a transaction in an unfavorable climate," Mr.
Hilton says of the disappointing proposals.
   JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago and an investor group led by
NWA Inc. executives Alfred Checchi, Frederic Malek and Gary
Wilson both submitted proposals to acquire Hilton's assets
for far less than the $5 billion or even $6 billion that many
analysts had anticipated last year.
   For the quarter, Mr. Hilton said, both major Las Vegas
hotel-casinos should report record results despite increased
competition. Operating profit from the gambling segment
should more than double, he said.
   Hotel operating profit rose about 7%, despite the adverse
effects of a three-week strike at the Hilton Hawaiian Village
and continuing softness in the San Francisco hotel market
after the earthquake in October. The gains stemmed in part
from strong occupancy rates in New York, Chicago, New Orleans
and other key cities.
   Although Mr. Hilton said he is "very optimistic about this
year," he stressed that the marked improvements in
first-quarter results won't necessarily set the pace for the
rest of 1990, for several reasons.
   In the 1989 first quarter, Hilton's Nevada casinos
experienced a streak of bad luck at the gaming tables, as
well as an expensive boxing promotion, that contributed to a
50% decline in profit from gambling operations. The
prior-year results were also affected by construction
disruptions in Reno, start-up costs from two new hotels, and
an early Easter holiday that is normally a soft time for the
hotel business.
   In the 1990 first quarter, hotel occupancy is expected to
be relatively flat at about 66%, influenced in part by a
handful of properties that are still in their first year of
operation.
   Mr. Hilton noted that the construction at the Flamingo
Hilton, which disrupted walk-in traffic for several months in
1989, is finished. O'Shea's, a casino with an Irish theme
that opened next door to the Flamingo Hilton, had its first
profitable month in March following a weaker-than-expected
opening last year.
   The Reno property should report record results in March,
despite a snowstorm over the normally busy President's Day
weekend. Mr. Hilton said the 2,000 room hotel-casino in
Laughlin, Nev., is on schedule to open in August.
