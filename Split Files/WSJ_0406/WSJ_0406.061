   WORCESTER, Mass. -- BankWorcester Corp., citing a
"dramatically weakened" real-estate market, said it will add
$11.9 million to its allowance for possible loan losses,
resulting in a loss for the first quarter -- and possibly
jeopardizing its agreement to be acquired by a Rhode
Island-based subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.
   In the year-earlier first quarter, BankWorcester had net
income of $2.8 million, or 38 cents a share.

   The company said it has charged off about $9.1 million of
loans, and said that after the provisions and charge-offs,
the loan-loss allowance will be about $14.4 million, or 1.5%
of loans outstanding. It said nonperforming assets total
about $44.5 million.
   As reported, BankWorcester has agreed to be acquired by
Royal Bank's Citizens Financial Group Inc. unit for $22.50 a
share, or about $149 million.
   One condition of the acquisition agreement, however,
provides that Citizens can terminate the agreement if
nonperforming assets and other items exceed $50 million after
all regulatory approvals for the acquisition have been
received. As of March 31, BankWorcester said, the level of
nonperforming assets and other items covered by the condition
totaled $58.6 million.
   BankWorcester said that the total is expected to fluctuate
over time and noted that the $50 million benchmark comes into
effect after receipt of all regulatory approvals.
   The company said, "The management of BankWorcester
believes that it will be able to meet this condition at that
point in time; however, there can be no assurance that this
condition will in fact be satisfied at that future time."
