   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., stumbling over
environmental regulations, plans to sell its hazardous
waste-disposal business and to take a charge of $295 million
for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31.
   For the huge waste hauler, No. 2 in its industry, the
abrupt exit from hazardous waste signals a defeat for its
strategy begun in 1988 to boost its environmental image. That
year, the company, based in Houston, named former
Environmental Protection Agency head William D. Ruckelshaus
chairman and chief executive officer.

   Despite the presence of Mr. Ruckelshaus, previously
praised by both environmentalists and industry competitors,
Browning-Ferris has been plagued with compliance problems in
New York, Louisiana and Ohio.
   In an interview, Mr. Ruckelshaus insisted the
environmental problems weren't decisive in the company's
departure from hazardous waste, but he conceded the problems
have caused "tension" within the company. He said
Browning-Ferris will focus on solid waste, recycling and
medical waste as its growth areas.
   Mr. Ruckelshaus blamed the move away from hazardous waste
on low profit margins, compared with its other businesses.
"They {margins} just aren't attractive enough, even assuming
we can overcome the regulatory problems, which I think we
could."
   Last month, a Dallas regional office of the EPA said two
of the company's units in Louisiana agreed to pay about $1.5
million to settle allegations that they violated hazardous
waste-disposal rules.
   Moreover, the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation last month denied a Browning-Ferris subsidiary
the state permits necessary to construct a new hazardous
waste cell at a landfill in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   In its statement yesterday, Browning-Ferris said a unit
has agreed with the Ohio attorney general's office to pay a
$25,000 fine and plead guilty to violating an environmental
law at its Williamsburg, Ohio, facility. The company also
will pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, establish an
environmental trust fund of $1 million for the state and pay
an additional $1 million to Clermont County. The cost of the
Ohio penalties are included in the one-time $295-million
charge.
   Hazardous waste produces just 2% of Browning-Ferris's
revenue, and the segment has had operating losses for the
past year and a half, the company said.
   In the year-ago quarter, the company had net income of
$58.8 million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $594.9
million.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the company's shares fell 25 cents to $35.375.
   Analysts said Browning-Ferris's decision to quit hazardous
waste comes at a time of increasing litigation in the
industry, concerns about liability for the health of
residents near landfills and rapidly rising costs for
technology that satisfies stricter environmental regulations.
"Managing a hazardous waste-disposal site in 1990 is much
more complicated and costly than it was 10 years ago," said
Kan Hahn, an analyst at Chicago Corp. She said
Browning-Ferris entered the hazardous waste field in 1982.
   "Today, your disposal site has to have synthetic
double-liners, costly air emissions systems and much more
detailed record-keeping," said Ms. Hahn. "{Mr.} Ruckelshaus
tried to make major improvements in Browning-Ferris's
operation but the company was already too far behind when he
arrived, without committing a lot more capital."
   The company's newest hazardous waste-disposal site is
scheduled to open soon in Last Chance, Colo. A spokesman said
the new state-of-the art facility is part of the assets being
put up for sale.
   It is uncertain where the company will find a buyer for
hazardous waste-disposal sites. One possibility is Chemical
Waste Management Inc., based in Oak Brook, Ill., the nation's
largest hazardous waste concern. But a Chemical Waste
spokesman, reached late yesterday, said it was too soon to
comment on the likelihood of such an acquisition, and other
company officials couldn't be reached.
   Mr. Ruckelshaus said he plans to continue running
Browning-Ferris. Yesterday's announcement "has no effect on
me," he said, adding, "It just didn't make sense to stay in
that business."
