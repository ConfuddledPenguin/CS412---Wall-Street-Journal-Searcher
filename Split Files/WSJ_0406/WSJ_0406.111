   EAST BERLIN -- Siegfried Schliemann watched communism
slowly mangle his family's business.
   The small sweater factory, founded by his grandfather in
1926, was taken over by the state in 1972. Then, in 1981, it
was folded into one of East Germany's unwieldy conglomerates,
lumped together with companies producing everything from
safety helmets to boat propellers.

   "They called it `rationalization,'" says Mr. Schliemann,
who was allowed to stay on as the firm's state-appointed
manager. I call it crazy."
   His main task in recent years, he says, was to preserve
some semblance of enterprise in a company where he couldn't
fire anyone or decide how many sweaters to produce. Now, he
is determined to make up for the blunders of the past.
   As East Germany lurches toward a free market, born-again
entrepreneurs like Mr. Schliemann are wasting no time seizing
the opportunity. Once a devout Communist, Mr. Schliemann has
applied to reprivatize the company, and he has combed West
Germany in search of partners to help him retool the
260-employee enterprise, VEB Berliner Strickmoden.
   "I'm a Berliner down to my bones," proclaims 60-year-old
Mr. Schliemann, "and I'm going to fight for a piece of this
market."
   He isn't alone. With rigid economic controls crumbling,
East Germany is poised for a burst of business activity.
Thousands of East Germans are expected to reclaim family
firms; many others are launching ventures -- everything from
grocery stores and restaurants to auto-repair shops and
medical clinics -- often with the help of West German
partners. Meanwhile, some of the state's huge conglomerates
have started to break up, with economically viable divisions
trying to shake off money-losing partners. By one West German
estimate, there may be 500,000 businesses about to be born in
East Germany.
   "We're expecting an avalanche of new companies to be
founded in the next six months alone," says Heinz Borchardt,
an economist at East Germany's fledgling small-business
association. The association, launched in January, already
claims 22,000 members and its own glossy magazine, called
"Market Economy."
   The financing for East Germany's business boom will be
provided by wealthy West Germans. The entire East German
car-and-truck industry, for example, is already a virtual
subsidiary of West German car makers. "But it's the East
Germans themselves who have the advantage in forging small
businesses," says Mr. Borchardt. "They're closer to the
market."
   New businesses are crucial to the country's economic
revival. As the Germanys hurtle toward monetary merger, the
East's creaking factories are expected to spew out as many as
two million unemployed, out of a population of only 16
million. A vibrant small-business sector could soak up some
of this excess labor.
   Bonn has poured six billion West German marks ($3.53
billion) into a special loan program for small and midsize
businesses, open to Germans from either side of the border.
West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said
yesterday that 3,000 loan applications worth nearly two
billion marks have already rolled in, most from East Germans
eager to set up family businesses.
   Meanwhile, many East Germans have figured out how to
bypass obstacles like the currency problem. Peter Wollanik,
owner of a small East Berlin interior-design company, is
restocking his shop with Western equipment and fabrics. Like
many entrepreneurs, he found a West German supplier willing
to ship materials, which he pays for at a rate of three East
German marks for one West German mark. The West German
suppliers, who have no guarantee they will get such a
favorable rate for their East German earnings, do so to lock
themselves into the new market.
   East Germans admit they are sometimes stymied by the ins
and outs of a market economy. Managers at East Germany's
state-run factories lived in a sheltered world of dictated
production targets and controlled prices. "Our people have
simply never learned how to deal with the consequences of a
market economy," says Manfred Pushmann, director of
management studies at East Berlin's Institute for Business
Management.
   There aren't many places an East German can go for help.
East Germany's small-business association is holding
market-economy seminars in various East German cities. "Our
people need answers to questions that nobody could even
imagine asking a few months ago -- like what's marketing?"
says Mr. Borchardt, the association's economist.
   Yet many of those who claim to offer answers to such
questions are viewed with suspicion. "I keep wondering where
these people were six months ago," says Mr. Wollanik, the
interior designer. East Berlin's Institute for Business
Management is offering expertise. But until a few months ago,
it was better known as the Communist Party Central
Committee's Institute for Socialist Economic Management.
   "We get half a dozen East Germans coming in here every day
asking for advice on how to get started in business," says
Ulrich Schmid, an East Berlin-based representative of West
Germany's Dresdner Bank AG. Western banks aren't yet allowed
to do business in the East, but many have set up
representative offices that dole out free advice.
   Mr. Schmid says some visitors have good ideas, such as the
two teen-agers who want to set up a courier service
specializing in sound equipment for Western rock bands. The
boys had studied the market, calculating that many bands
would use the recent political changes to stage East European
tours this summer.
   "I would have given them the loan, if I were in a position
to do so," says Mr. Schmid. "They were the
dishwasher-to-millionaire types."
   But even with the surge in private enterprise, East
Germany still faces a tough task creating fertile ground for
business. East Germany's Communist bosses built up an
elaborate system of disincentives for private firms, and the
country's newly elected democratic government hasn't begun
tackling legislation to create a true market economy.
