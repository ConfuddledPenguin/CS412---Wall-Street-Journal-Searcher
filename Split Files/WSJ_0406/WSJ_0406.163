   LAPEER, Mich. -- Durakon Industries Inc. is "comfortable"
with analyst forecasts that the company will earn $1 a share
or more a share this year, David Laro, president and chief
executive officer, said.
   The maker of pickup truck-bed liners and other auto parts
posted a $17.1 million, or $2.78-a-share, net loss for 1989.
Those results included non-recurring charges totaling $19.3
million, or $3.13 a share.

   Mr. Laro, in an interview, declined to give first-quarter
earnings figures. But Mr. Laro did say that, because of a
cost-reduction program Durakon began last year and other
positive developments, the company expects to perform better
this year. For the 1989 first quarter, Durakon had a net loss
of $1.1 million, on sales of $22.3 million.
   Durakon was awarded a contract in early March to supply
three General Motors Corp. assembly plants with pickup
truck-bed liners. GM will market the liners under Durakon's
Duraliner brand and sell them as factory-installed options.
GM is the first Big Three auto maker to offer Durakon's
truck-bed liners, which typically are sold and installed by
dealers, as factory-installed equipment. Truck-bed liners,
made of polymer, are used to protect the metal frame of a
vehicle and help to inhibit rusting.
   The contract "will give us a place in the market that is
stronger than ever," said Mr. Laro, who declined to estimate
the increase in sales the contract will bring.
   But Mr. Laro did say that, as a result of the GM contract,
he expects the percentage of all new pickup trucks purchased
with truck-bed liners to increase to about 50% from about 32%
now. "We will get the lion's share of that business, he said.
The new GM work prompted analysts to raise their forecasts of
Durakon's earnings for 1990 to $1 or more a share, from about
80 cents.
   Durakon wants to strike agreements similar to its GM
relationship with other auto makers. Last year, Durakon
became a supplier to Nissan Motor Co's. plant in Smyrna,
Tenn., which now is the only auto maker besides GM to offer
Durakon truck-bed liners as a factory option.
   Mr. Laro said that as a result of efficiencies gained from
new automated equipment and the upgrading of other
instruments, the company will not have to hire additional
personnel to handle the expected order increase. Durakon
spent $4 million to improve its factories.
   The agreement with GM comes as Durakon nears completion of
its cost-cutting program begun a year ago. Since then,
Durakon has changed management, sold some operations and
discontinued others. Mr. Laro became chief executive in March
1989. The company also cut its payroll by 8% to 941 people.
   Durakon wrote down $15 million of goodwill in connection
with its 1987 purchase of DFM Corp. The company also wrote
down by $3.8 million a patent held by its Jerr-Dan Corp.
subsidiary. Both those actions took effect in the fourth
quarter.
   Mr. Laro said Durakon has renegotiated contracts with its
suppliers that will save costs. Durakon plans to announce
further cost-cutting measures in the second quarter. Durakon
also sold two unprofitable business lines: a sailboat
manufacturer and its trucking business.
   Meanwhile officials decided to keep the company's Jerr-Dan
division, which makes roll-back car carriers, which are
flat-bedded trailers used by big trucks to haul automobiles.
Last year Durakon agreed to sell the division, but the deal
fell through when the buyer was unable to obtain financing,
Mr. Laro said. Now Durakon intends to keep Jerr-Dan, which
plans to unveil a new product next month. "There's
substantial value to our shareholders in keeping Jerr-Dan,"
Mr. Laro said.
