   AKRON, Ohio -- B.F. Goodrich Co. said it will raise the
price of pipe-grade polyvinyl chloride resin on May 1 by two
cents a pound, bringing the rail-car price to 38 cents a
pound.
   Goodrich, a major producer of the widely used plastic,
announced an increase of three cents a pound last January.
The company said the increase took effect in stages during
March and April.

   Goodrich said demand is strong for the material, which is
used in plumbing, siding and other construction products, as
well as for electrical wire insulation.
