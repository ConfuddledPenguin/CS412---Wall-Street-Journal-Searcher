   American Airlines, Eastern Airlines and Mesa Airlines all
reported March traffic increases.
   American, a unit of Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.,
said its traffic rose 4.1% to 6.45 billion revenue passenger
miles from 6.19 billion last year. A revenue passenger mile
is one paying passenger flown one mile. American's load
factor, or percentage of seats filled, fell to 63.2% from
65.6%.

   For the first quarter, American said it flew 17.5 billion
revenue passenger miles, up 7.9% from 16.2 billion. Its
year-to-date load factor was 59.9%, down from 60%.
   Miami-based Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said it
flew 1.72 billion revenue passenger miles last month, against
299 million a year ago, when Eastern was nearly grounded by a
strike. Eastern's load factor was 66.8% last month, compared
with 50% a year ago. For the quarter, revenue passenger miles
rose 9.2% to 4.75 billion from 4.35 billion. Load factor also
was up, to 63.2% from 59.2%.
   Mesa said its March traffic soared 74%, to 10.2 million
revenue passenger miles from 5.9 million a year ago. Load
factor fell to 47.4% from 51.5% last March.
   The commuter carrier attributed its increased traffic to
its new operations carrying passengers as a United Express
carrier out of Denver. The airline continues to operate as an
independent carrier out of its Albuquerque, N.M., and
Phoenix, Ariz., hubs.
   For the first three months of 1990, Mesa said its traffic
jumped 62%, to 25.1 million revenue passengers from 15.5
million in 1989. Load factor for the same period declined, to
44.7% from 48.5%.
