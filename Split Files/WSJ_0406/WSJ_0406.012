   WASHINGTON -- Growth in consumer debt continued to slow in
February, the Federal Reserve Board reported.
   Consumer installment credit expanded $3.42 billion during
the month, a 5.7% annual rate, according to the Fed. That was
the smallest rise since last October and followed rates of
6.4% and 7.3% in January and December, respectively.
Originally, the January rate was estimated at 5.9%.

   A drop-off in growth of automobile loans held back the
expansion of consumer credit, a statistic that includes all
consumer borrowing except mortgages. Car loans expanded $889
million, a 3.7% annual rate, after spurting $2.02 billion in
January, an 8.4% annual rate. Nevertheless, February's growth
in car financing is an improvement from late last year when
debt from auto loans was declining.
   Revolving credit, largely bank card and retail borrowing,
showed weak expansion for the second consecutive month.
Borrowing in this category grew $485 million, for a 2.9%
annual rate of increase, after inching forward at a 1.8%
annual rate in January.
   At the end of February, consumer installment debt totaled
$718.67 billion, up 5.3% from a year earlier.
