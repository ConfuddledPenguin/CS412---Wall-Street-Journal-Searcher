   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said it is extending for one
week the shutdown of its Mustang car assembly plant because
of slow sales.
   The Dearborn, Mich., production facility, which has been
closed this week, is now scheduled to resume output April 16.
Good Friday, April 13, is a holiday for virtually all U.S.
auto workers.

   Mustang sales so far this year are down 35% from year-ago
levels. Some 2,100 hourly employees work at the Dearborn
plant.
   Chrysler Corp. closed all but one of its four U.S.
car-assembly plants this week, idling a total of about 12,700
workers. The auto maker said all the plants are scheduled to
reopen April 9. The only car plant that worked this week is a
St. Louis facility that builds LeBaron and Daytona cars.
   General Motors Corp. said it has scheduled daily and
weekend overtime at its Janesville, Wis., and Lansing, Mich.,
assembly plants. Janesville builds the Chevrolet Cavalier and
Lansing manufactures the Buick Skylark and Cutlass Calais.
Overall, the 10 major U.S. auto makers plan to build 110,245
cars this week, down 30.7% from 159,001 a year ago.
   In March, the manufacturers built 992,012 cars and trucks,
down 3.6% from 1,028,993 vehicles in the same month a year
ago. Car production fell 4.9% and truck output was off 1.2%.
   Total U.S. car and truck output for the first quarter fell
21.4% compared with a year ago.
