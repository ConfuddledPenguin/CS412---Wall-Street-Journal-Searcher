   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co. pleaded guilty to two
misdemeanor violations of New York environmental law and paid
the state a $2 million fine.
   Kodak, which had been accused of contaminating ground
water at Kodak Park, its core manufacturing facility, also
signed a consent order to do extensive cleanup work at the
site. Company officials didn't have an immediate estimate on
how much that would cost.

   Kodak has already agreed to spend $100 million to replace
or remove 1,013 chemical storage tanks in the wake of
hometown furor over toxic spills. It also agreed to reduce
emissions of methylene chloride, a suspected cancer-causing
chemical, by 70% by 1995. But New York State Attorney General
Robert Abrams yesterday charged the company must still
"remedy decades of environmental abuse."
   Kodak pleaded guilty to unlawful removal of hazardous
waste in connection with a July 1, 1986, shipment of 48,900
pounds of contaminated soil to a silver-recovery plant. State
officials said Kodak failed to file proper hazardous waste
documents and ensure that the waste hauler and reclamation
plant were licensed to handle the hazardous soil.
