   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said it is considering making
light-aircraft engines, yet another sign of Japan's growing
interest in the aviation business.
   A Toyota spokesman said engineers at Japan's largest auto
maker "are examining whether our engines are applicable to
the aviation industry as well." But he stressed that "we
don't have any plans to market it or build anything in large
numbers at this point."

   He denied a report in the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun
yesterday that Toyota had already developed the engine and
was planning to seek U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
approval later this year to sell it in the U.S.
   "That's jumping the gun," he said. "We haven't made any
decisions one way or the other."
   Separately, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said it will
send three officials next week to West Germany to meet with
Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche Aerospace unit and to tour some
aerospace plants.
   A Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman said it will be the first
meetings between the two companies since they announced last
month that they were exploring linkups in a wide range of
sectors, including aviation.
   Japan currently lags far behind the U.S. and European
countries in aircraft, but it is making major efforts to
build a domestic industry. Worries about an emerging Japanese
aviation industry helped spark a controversy in the U.S.
Congress last year over the FSX fighter plane to be
co-produced by U.S. and Japanese companies.
   Currently, the only Japanese makers of aircraft engines
are Mitsubishi Heavy, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
Co., and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.
   Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest auto maker, has
been making rocket engines for more than 30 years.
   Since 1988, Toyota has been importing and exporting
airplanes, but it currently doesn't have aviation-related
manufacturing. If the company does start such production, it
might come by modifying the engine currently used in its
top-of-the-line luxury automobile, which is known as the
"Celsior" in Japan, and the "Lexus" in the U.S.
   Earlier this year, the auto maker announced it was
exploring expanding into marine-related equipment.
