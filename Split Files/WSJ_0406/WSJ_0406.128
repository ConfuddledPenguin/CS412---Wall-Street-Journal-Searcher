   Sanyo Electric Co., Tokyo, said it developed a
new-generation, high-performance, nickel-metal-hydride
storage battery cell, which is rechargeable and yet provides
a relatively large energy density.
   The company said that the battery cell provides 1.8 times
the energy density of conventional nickel-cadmium battery
cells, and that it is suitable for use in equipment such as
transceivers, cellular phones and laptop computers.
