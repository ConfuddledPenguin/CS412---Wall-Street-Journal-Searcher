   MANILA, the Philippines -- In a recent debt buy-back deal
with foreign commercial banks, the Philippines reduced its
debt stock 3.6% to $26.6 billion as of the end of January.
   This compares with $27.62 billion at the end of 1989,
according to latest figures on the country's foreign debt,
released by the Central Bank of the Philippines.

   A Central Bank official said January's lower level of
foreign debt coincides with a debt purchase plan the
Philippines signed with foreign creditors that month.
   The plan gave the debt-ridden country a chance to buy
$1.34 billion of debt, owed by government agencies to foreign
commercial banks, at a 50% discount.
   The Philippines used an estimated $668 million in new
loans obtained from the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, and Export-Import Bank of Japan to buy its debt.
