   WASHINGTON -- Despite rising tensions over Lithuania,
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev agreed
to hold their second summit meeting May 30-June 3 in the U.S.
   In addition, the Bush administration has quietly made an
economic concession to Mr. Gorbachev. U.S. diplomats in
Geneva agreed to admit the Soviet Union immediately to
observer status in world trade negotiations, rather than
delaying its entry until next year, as Mr. Bush had
originally pledged to do.

   The unannounced trade decision and the agreement on a
summit date, announced in the midst of a visit here by Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, formed part of a
pattern of mixed signals the Bush administration sent this
week about the status of U.S.-Soviet relations. While the
administration appeared to ratchet up its private rhetoric on
Lithuania, the warming trend in relations continued
unaffected.
   Administration officials, speaking anonymously, have put
out the word that Secretary of State James Baker turned up
the heat about Lithuania at a private State Department
meeting Wednesday. They say he warned that further armed
intimidation against Lithuania's independence drive could
severely disrupt U.S.-Soviet relations, even if Moscow
stopped short of mass violence. The officials add that
President Bush will make the same point when he meets the
foreign minister this morning.
   But Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker, who strongly favor holding the
summit and signing pending arms pacts with Moscow, have sent
a far more positive signal to Moscow with their actions. They
have kept the U.S.-Soviet dialogue rolling smoothly. In
addition to setting a summit date, the U.S. has pressed ahead
full steam during the Shevardnadze visit with efforts to
resolve key arms-control disputes by the summit date.
   "Gorbachev's watching what they're doing, not what they're
saying. And everything they're doing, in my view, is
encouraging Gorbachev to feel that he can do in Lithuania and
elsewhere what he feels he needs to do, at no cost. It is
reminiscent of the Bush approach to China," said Frank
Gaffney, a former Pentagon official who heads the
conservative Center for Security Policy.
   At last December's Malta summit, Mr. Bush said the U.S.
would withdraw its historic objection to Soviet participation
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade once the
current round of trade negotiations, called the Uruguay
Round, is over at year end. But a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said the U.S., after consulting
with its trading partners, decided there was no point in
making Moscow wait.
   White House officials said Mr. Baker warned Mr.
Shevardnadze that the administration couldn't maintain its
public restraint on the issue of Lithuania if Moscow kept
using troops and tanks to try to force the Baltic state to
drop its drive for independence.
   But the secretary of state also exhorted U.S. and Soviet
negotiators to redouble their efforts to settle key nuclear,
conventional and chemical arms-control issues in the seven
weeks remaining before the summit. The date is about a month
earlier than expected, apparently because Mr. Gorbachev has a
critical Communist Party Congress in July for which he must
prepare.
