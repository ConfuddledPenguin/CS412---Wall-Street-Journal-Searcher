   BFS Bankorp Inc. shares jumped 11% as the New York-based
holding company for Bankers Federal Savings settled
litigation with a dissident shareholder.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the shares
rose $1 to close at $10.

   Under terms of the agreement, the holder, First Capital
Group Inc., a Redondo Beach, Calif., investment firm, will
relinquish claim to the BFS board seat it won in a proxy
fight. BFS had filed suit to void the proxies that First
Capital solicited in trying to gain a directorship. Eldon C.
Hanes continues as chairman at BFS.
   BFS now will drop the lawsuit, agreeing to reimburse some
of First Capital's expenses related to the proxy
solicitation. First Capital, in turn, won't acquire any BFS
stock for five years.
   First Capital also will sell its shares to Fredric H.
Gould, who is to be named BFS's sixth director. BFS has
backed a plan under which Mr. Gould, Gould Investors L.P. and
BRT Realty Trust would seek clearance to boost their stake in
the thrift to as much as 24.9% from 9.9%. Mr. Gould is
chairman of BRT and a general partner of Gould Investors.
