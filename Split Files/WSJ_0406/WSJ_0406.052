   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Genesis Technology Group Inc. said it
formed a partnership with a group of Soviet biological
institutes to commercialize the institutes' technology in the
West and Japan.
   Genesis, a closely held concern, said it formed the
partnership, BioGenesis International, with Biogen, a group
of 26 Soviet biological institutes. Biogen, formed in 1988,
is unrelated to a biotechnology concern with the same name
based here.

   The partnership will seek to raise $10 million from drug
companies and other concerns outside the Soviet Union to fund
development of Soviet inventions in medicine, biotechnology
and agriculture, Genesis said. The partnership, which will
have offices here, in Moscow and in Kiev, U.S.S.R., also will
seek to arrange for the companies to pay for research at the
Soviet institutes in return for rights to resulting
inventions.
