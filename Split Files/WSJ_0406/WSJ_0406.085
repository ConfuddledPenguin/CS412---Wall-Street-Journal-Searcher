   CHICAGO -- The eight publicly traded funds originally
sponsored by ailing VMS Realty Partners said that they were
delaying dividend declarations and that distributions by the
three master limited partnerships would be suspended.
   The funds also said they had retained the accounting firm
of Coopers &amp; Lybrand to prepare an independent evaluation of
the value of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to the
troubled syndicator. VMS itself has retained Kenneth
Leventhal &amp; Co. to conduct its analysis.

   VMS raised $1.1 billion from more than 100,000 investors
through the funds, including sales commissions.
   All together, the funds are the largest creditor of VMS,
which has announced a series of liquidity problems and
management shake-ups since last November. Last month, First
Chicago Corp. set aside $150 to $160 million as a provision
for loan losses to offset loans to VMS entities. This week,
Xerox Corp., an owner of VMS, said it would take a
first-quarter write-off of nearly $400 million on VMS-related
equity and unsecured investments and loans.
   Leonard G. Levine, president and chief executive officer
of the funds, said the announcements were a part of steps
toward full control by the funds' boards. The funds were
administered and advised by VMS, which reaped huge fees from
them until February of this year. The funds include five real
estate investment trusts, or REITs, and three master limited
partnerships, or MLPs, all of which made loans exclusively to
VMS entities and projects.
   Mr. Levine, who had been responsible for structuring and
administering the funds as a VMS senior vice president, said
he expected an oral report from the accountants in the next
30 days. While he wouldn't estimate the value of the funds'
loans to VMS, Mr. Levine said their net per-share value was
"substantially in excess of the market price."
   The funds, issued at $10 a share and sold by a nationwide
network of broker-dealers led by Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., have been trading at prices sharply below their book
value. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, VMS Mortgage Investment Fund closed at $1.25, up
31.25 cents. The three MLPs all were trading below $1 a share
in the over-the-counter market.
   In his first interview since leaving VMS last December,
Mr. Levine said it was logical to question his position with
the funds, given his previous position with VMS. But he
defended that position as a "vote of confidence" by the
funds' directors in his knowledge and experience with the
funds.
   While Peter R. Morris, the founder of VMS, and Joel A.
Stone, the firm's current chairman and chief executive
officer, have both left the boards of the funds, the
remaining directors were all nominated by VMS and served as
directors during VMS's management of the funds. The directors
weren't available for comment.
   Mr. Levine acknowledged that a number of the funds made
loans to other funds or in participation with them. But he
said that such participation was on an equal footing between
the funds and that the interests of the eight funds in
negotiations with VMS were "in concert, not in conflict."
   Mr. Levine wouldn't comment on the results, or even the
tenor, of a major VMS creditors' meeting that took place on
Tuesday. But he said the funds would exercise "all of their
rights as creditors" to recover the principal amounts loaned
to VMS and to enforce the dividend guarantees made by a VMS
affiliate.
   The guaranteed dividends were a major selling point of the
funds, which many broker-dealers aimed at selling to people
on fixed incomes or with personal pension funds to invest.
VMS executives say the firm, which once claimed control of as
much as $9 billion in assets, won't enter bankruptcy-law
proceedings, and Mr. Levine said the funds wouldn't force
such proceedings. "Our principal recovery plan will be more
successful without a third-party intervention," Mr. Levine
said.
   Mr. Levine said the announcements were unrelated to the
Xerox moves. "Our loans are secured principally by mortgages
or other interests in real property," he said. Those
interests include junior debt and assigned interests in
partnerships according to quarterly reports by the funds.
   Mr. Levine said the funds, formerly housed at VMS's
headquarters here, had opened their own offices in Chicago
and were seeking new advisers and new names for the funds
which didn't mention VMS. He said they would open an investor
relations department at the end of the month.
