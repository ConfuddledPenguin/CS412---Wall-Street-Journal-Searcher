   Should public schools teach morality to children?
   A growing number of parents, worried that their children
aren't building good character, are pushing educators to cram
moral lessons into the already crowded school day. But school
districts are finding that many teachers are opposed to the
task and play hooky when assigned to teach such classes.

   About 84% of public school parents want moral values
taught in school, and 68% want educators to develop strict
standards of "right and wrong," according to a Gallup Poll.
Parental pressure has recently spurred some state
legislatures and education departments to urge public schools
to teach students values such as honesty, respect, and
patriotism. Hundreds of companies, including Glendale Federal
Bank, Glendale, Calif., and Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard,
Mass., pump millions of dollars into such programs.
   But polls also show that most teachers object to the
concept of morality education on philosophical or practical
grounds; many fear that such programs will stir up
controversy in classrooms where diverse student bodies
already cause plenty of headaches. Even districts that have
printed values curricula and issued teaching materials at
great expense find that such items often gather dust on
teachers' shelves.
   Concern over values among parents and educators is
reinforced by statistical measures. A recent Louis Harris &amp;
Associates Inc. survey conducted for the Girl Scouts found
that 47% of students would cheat on an exam; in another
survey, 66% said they would lie to achieve a business
objective. U.S. teen pregnancy, drug abuse and juvenile crime
rates are among the highest in the industrialized world.
   A Baltimore County, Md., public school survey showed
parents spend 15 minutes a week in "meaningful dialogue" with
their children, who glean values mainly from peers and
television. "We know kids have very little sense of right or
wrong," says Thomas Lickona, an education professor at State
University of New York at Cortland. "Schools must step into
the breach."
   They already have done so in several states, including New
York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and California, which ask
teachers to hold separate morality classes or infuse moral
values into language arts, social studies and history
lessons. Fresno, Calif., schools feature a value of the
month; February's was love. Los Angeles and other large
districts also are initiating programs.
   To decide what to teach, state education boards generally
round up diverse professionals -- a civil-liberties lawyer, a
fundamentalist preacher and a rabbi, for instance -- who
arrive at an acceptable list of values to be taught. Respect,
responsibility, compassion, honesty and civic participation
usually head the list.
   Districts often buy a prepackaged values curriculum, such
as one from the Thomas Jefferson Center, a Pasadena, Calif.,
nonprofit group that promotes values education. The center's
program promises to build character in children in just 10
minutes a day. Sales this year have jumped fourfold.
   Margaret Carlson, a teacher of English at Contoocook
Valley High School in Peterboro, N.H., says she supports
morals education because "there are some values -- like
courage and honesty, responsibility and self-control -- basic
things that really aren't debatable." She adds: "Building
moral character is good. Getting away from this has
impoverished our people."
   But organized programs have failed to score with many
teachers, as well as some parents and educators. Some
teachers at training sessions openly say that, on principle,
they will refuse to teach values courses, says Patrick J.
McCarthy, executive vice president of the Jefferson Center.
   When Barbara Kuhlman Brown, vice president of the Concord,
N.H., school board, went to a state seminar on teaching
morals last summer, the sponsors spoke of pushing
Judeo-Christian culture. "My God," whispered a board
colleague, who had been educated in Nazi Germany. "I can see
their brown shirts."
   Because of educators' opposition, New Hampshire has
delayed implementing a values-education program that was
supposed to start last fall. The Concord school board also
has vowed to keep values education out of its schools. "This
wipes out diversity and separation of church and state," Ms.
Brown says. "It negates everything public schools stand for."
   Using a hypothetical example, Ms. Brown says teachers
worry how to respond if a student asks whether her father is
a thief for bringing home pens from the office -- and then
another tells how his father, who loves him dearly and can't
afford a bicycle, picked one up on the street for him. To
what degree, she also asks, should teachers emphasize courage
if a child wonders about rushing into a burning building to
save someone?
   Mark Beauvais, superintendent of the Concord district,
adds, "It would be dangerous, sad and boring to have one view
of morality imposed on our people." At values-education
training sessions, some teachers express fear of foisting
white, middle-class values on highly pluralistic classes, he
adds. For example, some teachers say, because values are
culturally determined, some groups stress competitiveness
over cooperation.
   After a decades-long drive for teachers to be
value-neutral, some say they can't adjust to openly teaching
right and wrong. McGuffey Readers, with their strong moral
messages, have long been shunned for value-neutral texts and
teacher-training courses. Texts describe the Pilgrims not as
seekers of religious freedom but as "people who take long
trips."
   Other hard-pressed instructors resist moral education as
an added burden. In Chicago, teachers complain that it takes
time away from English and math classes, on which they are
evaluated. Teacher skepticism increases when mandates arrive
without funds attached: In a study of a Chicago public school
program, Northwestern University found that some schools
didn't have money to photocopy materials needed for
character-building classes.
   "Every year, something new comes down the pike. Teachers
don't listen anymore," says Ms. Carlson, the New Hampshire
teacher, who despite her support for moral education expects
it to fizzle in the face of teacher opposition. "They have
seen too many saviors."
   Teachers also fear sparking lawsuits or parental wrath.
Some Portland, Maine, parents have already protested when the
teaching of tolerance raised the issue of homophobia. Howard
County, Md., plans to promote "respect for life" as one of 18
approved values, but teachers expect tricky questions about
abortion and the death penalty. Some junior high school
teachers in San Marcos, Calif., fear they will foster family
discord by lifting the moral standards of students above
those of their parents, says Jerry Harrington, a
seventh-grade life-sciences teacher.
   Some teachers respond by ignoring morals programs. The
Chicago Foundation for Education, a private group that funded
that city's program, asked Northwestern to see how much
morality it was buying. The university found that 35% of
sixth-grade teachers weren't implementing any part of the
mandatory program, even though teachers conferred twice
yearly with Northwestern researchers and had to keep logs
detailing their efforts.
   Where the program was at least partially implemented, 70%
of principals detected significant reductions in truancy and
80% saw substantial drops in disciplinary problems, the study
found. But just two of 45 classes monitored completed the
curriculum. Now, to give parents and educators a stake in the
program, the foundation funds it only in schools where
principals seek it and where parents and others try to
provide up to 20% of the cost.
   Despite misgivings about teaching moral values, some
teachers are warming to the task. At Dundalk Elementary
School in Baltimore County, one teacher's husband built CO3,
a robot that champions compassion, courtesy, and cooperation.
Students displaying those values get to take the robot to
lunch. Some districts find that grading teachers for
imparting values stimulates interest.
   But Boston University figures teachers will embrace the
concept only if it's taught to them in college. Last year,
the school opened its Center for the Advancement of Ethics
and Character for teaching students. Maine and New Hampshire
also have begun values-education seminars, where teachers
learn Socratic teaching methods and read the Bible, Plato's
"Republic" and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From
Birmingham Jail."
