   NEW YORK -- Does anyone want to buy a 40-year government
bond?
   Last January, when the U.S. government tried to sell
40-year bonds for the first time since the 1950s, the $5
billion auction of Resolution Funding Corp. bonds was a flop.
Investor demand wasn't even close to the levels that dealers
had expected. After the auction results were announced,
prices of the bonds fell sharply, and yields soared.

   Well, get ready for the games to begin again because the
government is back for another try. This time, Refcorp plans
to sell $3.5 billion of the "bailout bonds" Tuesday, the
proceeds of which will be used to finance the government's
rescue of the nation's troubled savings and loan industry.
   For the government, the 40-year bonds are attractive
because it can stretch out the cost of the thrift-industry
bailout over a longer period of time. The longest maturity of
government bonds is normally 30 years. Professional traders
and speculators are excited because the 40-year bonds are a
new way to make big money by gambling on interest rates.
   But for individual investors, there are big risks
associated with owning bonds that mature in 40 years. True,
the bonds are safe because they are backed by the federal
government. While Refcorp bonds don't actually carry a
government guarantee, interest payments are guaranteed by the
Treasury and principal payments are secured by Treasury
securities.
   But the interest-rate risk is enormous. That's because the
longer the lifetime of a bond, the more its price swings with
changes in interest rates. "These bonds are highly volatile,"
said Wayne Wong, managing director of fixed-income management
at MarinVest, a subsidiary of New York's Marine Midland Bank.
   For example, Mr. Wong said, if interest rates rise one
percentage point, the price of a 10-year government bond at
current yields would fall 6.26%. But the price of a 40-year
bond would fall 10%.
   Since interest rates are tough to forecast, "by the time
an individual may need the money, it may not be the right
time to sell the bonds," Mr. Wong said. He believes that
individual investors are better off in intermediate-term
government bonds maturing in six to 20 years. Currently,
these intermediate bonds yield about the same as do
longer-term bonds due to a condition referred to as a
flat-yield curve. "For individuals, it doesn't pay to go out
40 years," Mr. Wong said.
   So who would want a 40-year bond? One group of buyers is
expected to be pension funds and insurance companies who need
bonds with extra-long maturities to match future claims.
Another likely group of buyers is professional traders eager
for yet another vehicle to bet on swings in interest rates.
   Analysts think that Tuesday's 40-year auction will go a
lot better than the last time. One reason is the smaller size
of the issue. Another is changed conditions in the bond
market.
   James Fralich, an economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said
demand for long-term bonds is growing. "A lot of
institutional investors have accumulated a decent amount of
cash and now are looking to put that cash to work," he said.
   In addition, traders note, interest rates have risen more
than 1/2 percentage point since January, making long-term
bonds far more attractive. And because the first 40-year bond
auction went so poorly, some analysts expect investors to
demand a much higher yield relative to Treasurys than at the
previous auction. In January, the 40-year bond was priced to
yield about 1/4 percentage point more than the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds, but analysts say this time the
40-year bond could be priced at a yield that is 1/3
percentage point higher than the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond.
   Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary for federal
finance at the Treasury, said he solicited the opinions of a
dozen primary dealers who do business mainly with large
institutional investors. "Seventy percent of the dealers
suggested that we do the 40-year bond," he said. "They felt
there is sufficient demand."
   A large portion of the $3.5 billion of bonds is expected
to be stripped by securities dealers. Strips are created by
separating the semiannual interest payments from the
principal portion of the bond and selling the pieces
separately. The principal-only portion, called a zero-coupon
bond, is sold at a deep discount to its face value and is
considered one of the most volatile securities around.
   Dealers say that a 40-year zero-coupon Refcorp bond could
sell for as little as $35 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. An investor who buys the zero won't get any interest
payments but after 40 years will get $1,000.
   As trading vehicles, 40-year zeros can be lethal or
lucrative depending upon an investor's ability to
successfully time interest-rate moves. If rates rise one
percentage point, the price of a 40-year zero-coupon bond
could plummet by more than 30%. That's three times the
volatility of a regular 40-year bond. Of course, if rates
fall one percentage point, the price of a 40-year zero jumps
more than 40% -- a windfall profit.
   Paul Suckow, director of fixed-income securities at
Oppenheimer Management Corp., said trading a 40-year zero is
"almost like trading a futures contract. You don't have to
put up a lot of money to control a lot of volatility," he
said.
   More than half of the previous Refcorp 40-year bond issue
-- $2.5 billion of the $5 billion issue -- has been stripped
into zero-coupon securities, according to a recent report
from Federal Home Loan Banks. But a large percentage of that
activity was by Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., which now
is out of business.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The corporate financing window swung wide open yesterday
as nearly $1.7 billion in new debt was offered, bringing the
total so far this week to $2.5 billion.
   Corporate heavyweights, ranging from blue chip industrials
to finance companies, were active in the debt market, taking
advantage of what some see as a finance opportunity ahead of
upcoming Treasury and agency supply.
   Among the sizable issuers that came to market were
Hydro-Quebec, General Motors Acceptance Corp. and Du Pont Co.
   The three accounted for $1.1 billion of the new debt
issuance, with Hydro-Quebec, a Canadian utility, being the
largest issuer. The utility offered $500 million of
noncallable 40-year debentures, which were priced at 99.873
to yield 9.387%.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. said in a report that its junk bond
index recorded a negative 3.08% return in the first quarter.
However, for March, the index managed to show a positive
return of 1.06%.
   Salomon said its deferred-interest index, which tracks the
zero-to-full coupon sector of the market, again showed more
price volatility than the cash-paying index. For the first
quarter, the deferred interest index recorded a negative
return of 8.15%.
   In trading, prices of most investment-grade corporate
issues were unchanged to slightly weaker. Junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, ended down about 1/4 point.
   But the junk bonds of Circle K Corp. surged in thin,
odd-lot trading. The Phoenix, Ariz.-based convenience store
operator, said late last night that it signed a preliminary
agreement with senior creditors and its largest shareholder
for a seven-month moratorium on debt and interest payments,
narrowly averting default on part of its debt.
   Circle K's 13% junior subordinated debentures, maturing in
1997, chalked up five points to close at 22 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury notes and bonds ended modestly lower in quiet
trading ahead of today's potentially market -- moving U.S.
employment report.
   "The day before the release of an employment report, the
market tends to be quiet," said Robert Chandross, an
economist at Lloyds Bank PLC. "Nobody wants to stick their
neck out."
   The employment report is considered among the most
important of the U.S. government's monthly economic
indicators. Because surprises in the data can upset the bond
prices, many investors stay inactive ahead of its release.
   The March employment data is especially important because
it will help determine whether January's and February's
explosive jobs growth was an aberration or the start of a
trend toward fast economic growth.
   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets expect,
on average, non-farm jobs to have increased 178,000 last
month. In February, there were 372,000 new jobs created.
   In trading yesterday, the benchmark 30-year bond ended at
a price of 99 24/32 compared to 99 28/32 on Wednesday. The
yield was unchanged at 8.51%. The benchmark 10-year bond
ended at 99 19/32 compared with Wednesday's price of 99
22/32. That yield also was unchanged at 8.55%.
   Traders said short-term rates finished little changed. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at
7.75% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.99% while the rate on
six-month bills rose slightly to 7.75% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.16%.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold nearly $10 billion of 52-week
bills yesterday at an average rate of 7.71%. Here are details
of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.
                                                                                                       

                                        52-Week Bills

   The bills are dated April 12 and mature April 11, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals

   Municipal bonds were flat to up as much as 1/4 point in
late dealings.
   "It's very boring today (Thursday)," said a municipal
trader.
   Throughout the week, traders have said that, barring
unforeseen events, little spark is expected in the municipal
market before the release of March U.S. employment data,
scheduled for Friday.
   Among seasoned dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority
7.20% securities of 2018 were up 1/8 point at 97 1/2 to 97
5/8 to yield 7.40%, unchanged from yields quoted late
Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended flat to
slightly higher.
   Prices tracked but outperformed Treasurys, which ended
lower but above the day's lowest levels.
   Government National Mortgage Associations 9% securities
for April delivery were quoted at 96 4/32, up 1/32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 10% securities were
quoted at 100 1/32, unchanged.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Bank of Canada's bank rate rose to 13.57% yesterday, its
highest level in more than seven years.
   The rise followed a new inflation warning by Bank of
Canada Governor John Crow. In a speech Wednesday night to
business people in Brossard, Quebec, Mr. Crow said "cost and
price pressures in the Canadian economy remain strong." He
added that tightening of monetary conditions since
mid-January appears to have been well-advised in light of
"persistently strong spending and inflation pressures."
   Mr. Crow said Bank of Canada "will continue to encourage
sufficient monetary restraint to bring about a significant
improvement in Canada's underlying inflation performance."
   Canada's February consumer price index was up 0.6% from
January and up 5.4% from a year earlier. The March data will
be announced April 20.
   In early trading, Canadian bonds were modestly lower on
the news.

             How Interest Rates Move Bond Prices
                                                                                                       

 Here's a hypothetical example of how five different bonds --
a 10-year, 20-year, 30-year, 40-year and 40-year zero-coupon
-- would respond to changes in interest rates. Assume the
bonds were issued with a coupon rate of 8.875%.
