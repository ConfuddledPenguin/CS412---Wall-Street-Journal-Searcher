   BRUSSELS -- The average rate of unemployment in the 12
European Community countries was a seasonally adjusted 8.6%
in February, unchanged from January, the EC's statistics
agency, Eurostat, said.
   The rate was down from 9.7% in February 1989. On an
unadjusted basis, average EC unemployment was 8.9% in
February, also unchanged from January. The rate was down from
10.1% in February 1989.

   Eurostat said that during the past three years, the EC
unemployment rate as a whole has fallen by a constant 0.7
percentage point a year, from 10.6% in February 1987.
Unemployment has thus fallen by about 20% during the past 36
months, Eurostat said.
   Unemployment fell during that period in all member states,
with the exception of Italy and Denmark, Eurostat said.
   Adjusted unemployment in February was highest in Ireland,
at 16.7%. It was lowest in Luxembourg, at 1.6%.
