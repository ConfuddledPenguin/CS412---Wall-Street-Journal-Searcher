   Horace Greeley told the enthusiastic young to head west
for opportunity. Today this has largely become the
conventional wisdom, and not without reason. The line is that
the New Yorks and Massachusetts are gagging on bloated
budgets and deficits, while out west one finds the future in
entrepreneurially driven success stories. The West deserves a
closer look. California, Arizona, Washington, Oregon and
Colorado all have become scenes for the growing tension in
the U.S. between tax-siphoning public-spending commitments
and the taxpayers who keep getting asked to give more.
   For more than a decade in California, the publicrats have
chafed under both a state spending limitation pushed through
by Paul Gann and Howard Jarvis's property-tax rollback, which
voters approved in 1978. California has since settled into
the middle rank in tax burden among the 50 states, and it has
enjoyed boom years.

   By and large, Republican Governor George Deukmejian has
protected this voter mandate. Only in law-enforcement and
prisons has the Governor been a big spender. But now, the
public-sector lobby has found a wedge: highways.
   The story is an involved one but basically the state's
legislature has convinced the Governor to back a relaxation
of the Gann limit on this June's ballot so that the gasoline
tax can be doubled to 18 cents a gallon (on top of the sales
tax) to pay for pavement. Part of the deal is a separate bond
issue for more mass transit, which of course requires
taxpayer subsidies that never end.
   However, the Gann limit's cap on total outlays isn't the
reason that California is having infrastructure problems in
prosperous times. Other programs now claim the money that
roads used to get. School spending has exploded. Social
services grow steadily more expensive even as they get uglier
at the recipients' end. Thanks to a legislature-imposed
cost-of-living allowance, the state has some of the highest
welfare payments in the land.
   The Democrats are cheering on Mr. Deukmejian, as is the
Los Angeles Times. Their support group includes the
public-employee unions, local governments and transit
districts, major businesses, builders and hospital interests.
It sees this vote as a turning point, the symbolic twilight
of California's tight-fistedness with public spending. The
only force bucking these bigwigs is the rag-tag taxpayer
groups. Still, they may again have the taxpayers' pulse:
Polls show a close vote.
   Arizona, the onetime Sunbelt superstar, also is
discovering what happens when state government grows too big
for its britches. In addition to adding prison space, Arizona
for the past decade has been running up its relief and
health-care tabs. The result is a perpetually looming budget
deficit that always must be fed new taxes.
   You may remember the Phoenix establishment's part in the
tribunals to oust Governor Evan Mecham. This corporatist
element is behind a report called Fiscal 2000, which among
other things recommends heavier reliance on the progressive
income tax. An analysis for the Goldwater Institute suggested
that this would have the effect of generating a greater
revenue stream and thus closing the "structural deficit" that
Fiscal 2000 found was plaguing the state. In other words, the
higher public-spending trend line of the 1980s would be
affirmed. A governor's election this year will give voters a
chance to decide whether Arizona is to adopt the tax, spend
and tax model so familiar in the Northeast.
   Up north in Washington, times are so good that an
embarrassing $725 million surplus has accumulated from the
higher business and consumer taxes that were imposed during
the last downturn. By one measurement, the state's tax burden
in the 1980s went from 39th heaviest in the country to 17th.
Washington is only state that still relies heavily on a
gross-receipts tax, a killer for start-up enterprises that
aren't yet showing profits. The state thrived in the face of
such levies because the dominant Boeing Co. has had done well
and because other exporters and importers benefit from being
Japan's closest American continental neighbor.
   Now, as during the recession, state policy is to raise
taxes. Because Southern Californians are bringing road
congestion with them as they migrate in droves into the
Northwest, Washington legislators have enacted the highest
gas tax in the country -- to 23 cents, not counting local
surcharges and sales taxes (plus nine cents a gallon for the
feds).
   Meanwhile, the state's legislators this week voted to
disburse $475 million of the surplus, mostly to schools and
schoolteachers but also to welfare recipients and state
employees. It's a spend-the-surplus scenario similar to that
played out to unhappy results in the Northeast. To date
Washington's voters have fought off a state income tax. No
wonder so many Californians are coming.
   In Oregon, which is getting its share of in-migration,
both major-party candidates for governor have signed on to
the imposition of a sales tax. For years, it's been as
fiercely resisted by the public there as the income levy has
in neighboring Washington. The politicians are promising that
it could bring relief from other taxation. In Colorado, where
a taxpayer initiative to curb government growth failed last
time around, another is due for this year's ballot.
   The lure of the Pacific and maybe again of Mexico will
likely continue to beckon Americans toward the commercial and
recreational promise of the sunset shoreline. But nowadays
Horace Greeley would have to hedge: Go West, but take along
an accountant and a tax lawyer.
