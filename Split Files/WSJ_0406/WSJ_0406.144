   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. resumed talks on an
informal basis with its two unions, the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers on an early retirement program for
non-management employees.
   Formal negotiations between the New York-based
telecommunications giant and the unions broke off on March 27
in Washington after the unions rejected AT&amp;T's proposal,
which was designed to attract twice as many workers as are
eligible for retirement.

   AT&amp;T, which trimmed its work force in 1989 by 25,500 jobs
to a current total of 281,400, has firm plans to cut as many
as 12,000 jobs this year. The new retirement program, if
successful, could trim an additional 20,000 positions, an
AT&amp;T spokesman said.
