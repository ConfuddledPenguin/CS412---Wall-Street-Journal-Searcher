   WASHINGTON -- The honeymoon is over for Small Business
Administration head Susan Engeleiter.
   Almost a year ago, Ms. Engeleiter arrived here touted as a
savvy young Wisconsin politician who promised to become a
strong champion of small business. The consensus of many
small-business interests is that she has settled in as a
competent federal official. But now they want the SBA
administrator to deliver broader leadership and more vision.

   "In the first year, she's established an agency that's
prepared to make some changes,"says John Paul Galles,
executive vice president of National Small Business United, a
lobbying group. "I'm anxious to learn what those changes
might be."
   Such groups credit the 38-year-old Ms. Engeleiter with
generally reflecting small-business views. But they say she
isn't aggressive enough on certain matters important to them,
such as initiating a dialogue with the Department of Health
and Human Services as it prepares a major study on
health-care costs. And Mr. Galles says the agency could learn
from state-level programs that link small firms with specific
opportunities in the U.S. and abroad.
   Small businesses, to a large extent, are asking for a new
level of leadership from the chief of the SBA, whose leaders
in the past have had little clout beyond the small agency.
But it is a new standard that was set by Ms. Engeleiter
herself. Though she never ran a small business herself, she
promised to be an outspoken advocate for people who do.
   "A lot of people wanted her to make a big splash right
away and to go to war for small business. That's unfair,"
says John Motley, chief lobbyist for the National Federation
of Independent Business, the largest association of
small-business owners. "Susan's a good politician, and they
don't make waves until they find out what damage the waves
will cause."
   Ms. Engeleiter has concentrated heavily on matters inside
the SBA, rather than in the business world, Mr. Motley says.
But "in her second year," he adds, "she'll have to become
more visible or the criticisms will be valid."
   Ms. Engeleiter, whose annual SBA salary is $89,000,
resists the idea that she needs to make a "big splash" to
make her mark. She says that in her first year she has
focused on shaping up the agency, which has more than 4,100
employees and an annual budget of about $350 million. "I've
always been known for being prepared and doing my homework,"
she says. "I'm also implementing a lot of changes, and nobody
likes change. Some people may be disgruntled."
   The spirits of many people at the SBA -- which former
President Reagan twice tried to abolish on the claim it's
irrelevant to most businesses -- remain low, despite
morale-boosting efforts by the SBA chief, such as sending a
bagpipe player around Washington offices on St. Patrick's
Day. Some staffers complain that even minor items often get
hung up for months in Ms. Engeleiter's office, which they
deride as "the black hole" and "the Bermuda Triangle." In
late February, Janine Perrignon, vice president for SBA
lending at Commercial Bank of San Francisco, received a
letter from Ms. Engeleiter appointing her to the region's SBA
Advisory Council. The two-year term was to have begun about
eight months earlier.
   Ms. Engeleiter's frequent travel has prompted speculation
that she's keeping her political fires well-stoked in
Wisconsin, where she was the state senate minority leader and
barely lost a bid as the Republican candidate for the U.S.
Senate in 1988. Her travel record lists 31 trips since her
appointment last May, five of them to Wisconsin and four to
Minnesota.
   The SBA chief bridles at any suggestion that she has
traveled too much or for political motives. She notes that
because her agency provides disaster loans, some trips have
been to areas such as those hit by Hurricane Hugo. "There's a
Washington perception that if you're in Phoenix or Seattle,
or touring a disaster center in Puerto Rico, that you're not
working," she says. "The attitude is that this is where
everything happens. That's absurd."
   Ms. Engeleiter says she took over an embattled agency
whose programs hadn't been thoroughly examined in years.
Moreover, the SBA was charged with quickly carrying out new
laws such as one governing a procurement program for
minorities. "It's really been like starting at ground zero,"
the SBA chief says. "I had extensive meetings on Capitol
Hill, and there was the arduous job of going through
everything program by program."
   Recently, she announced a set of 13 initiatives for the
agency's financial programs, including one to encourage
lenders to make more small loans of $50,000 or less by
increasing their fees for such loans. She says the agency
also will begin promoting SBA loans for exporters.
   The SBA's major limitation, Ms. Engeleiter says, is that
since last fall it has been operating without a chief counsel
for its Advocacy Office, the independent research arm charged
with defending small-business interests. President Bush
nominated educator Kyo Jhin for the post last June, but Mr.
Jhin's nomination ran into opposition in the Senate because
of his lack of small-business experience, and he withdrew in
February. The White House hasn't nominated anyone else.
   "We've been dramatically hindered by the lack of a chief
counsel for advocacy," she says. "Candidly, it's been very
difficult. . . . We've been very handicapped."
   Ms. Engeleiter benefits from the Bush administration's
support for the SBA-support that contrasts sharply with the
Reagan stance. As a result, "SBA as a whole is in an upbeat
state," says Tony Wilkenson, president of the National
Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders. "The pressure's
been taken off as to whether it'll be there.
   The SBA chief also gets good reviews from the agency's
oversight committees in Congress, although the SBA still is
seen as too much under the thumb of the White House Office of
Management and Budget. Rep. John LaFalce, (D., N.Y.),
chairman of the House Small Business Committee, says the SBA
chief is "energetic and a good spokesperson for the
small-business community." But he adds that "the jury's still
out" on her performance.
