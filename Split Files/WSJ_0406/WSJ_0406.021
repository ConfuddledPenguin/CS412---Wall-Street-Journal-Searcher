   SEOUL -- Many South Korean government and business
officials, impatient with the slow progress that Seoul and
Moscow have made toward normalized relations in the past two
years, are trying to speed the process. The shift in pace is
alarming some Korean officials.
   "Koreans are by temperament a very impatient people," says
a national security adviser to President Roh Tae-Woo. "Many
are simply tired of waiting and want to rush ahead. But now
more than ever, we must be cautious."

   The adviser says that the Soviet Union remains a highly
risky place politically and economically. He notes that
ongoing tensions between Moscow and Lithuania underscore the
continuing instability of the Soviet Union.
   Given the political uncertainty, some Korean officials are
particularly anxious to establish an investment-guarantee
treaty with the Soviets to diminish the potential for what
the adviser calls "economic disaster and the loss of Korean
investments." Friction on the economic front, he warns, could
undermine the budding Korean-Soviet relationship and even
renew tensions between Moscow and Seoul.
   "We are in a dangerous phase," adds a Korean Foreign
Ministry official. "There's a certain recklessness about the
way that some prominent Koreans have begun rushing at
breakneck speed to grab profit -- or glory -- from the
development of relations between these two long-estranged
countries."
   The officials urging caution are responding to a flurry of
recent developments between the two countries, culminating in
Friday's announcement that Seoul plans to send a government
delegation to Moscow in May to discuss the establishment of
formal diplomatic relations.
   While Seoul insists that some type of formal relations is
a prerequisite for greater trade and investment between the
two countries, Korean businesses are busily gearing up for
eventual normalization. Many companies already have signed
big trade contracts, joint-venture agreements and other
business deals.
   Though unofficial government contacts between Seoul and
Moscow have been carried out openly for at least two years,
the May meeting would be the first official
government-to-government discussions on normalizing
relations. On the Soviets' side, the chief obstacle to
normalization is Moscow's worry about the reaction of its
communist ally, North Korea, which remains a bitter enemy of
South Korea.
   A spokesman for Mr. Roh said the Korean government would
"take a prudent attitude in promoting the goal of improving
relations with the Soviet Union."
   That attitude is shared by Park Chul-Un, Korea's minister
of state for political affairs, who returned from Moscow last
week. Mr. Park warned on Saturday that Korean haste in
wanting to normalize relations with the Soviet Union would
give Moscow the upper hand in negotiations. He indicated that
Moscow already has asked for financial assistance from Korea,
but he gave no details.
   "We couldn't sound out {the Soviets on} detailed
conditions on the establishment of links so far," he said.
"What do you think they require of us? It may be something
that will inflict a great burden on us. We don't have to make
haste. They may then ask for more."
   Mr. Park's caution wasn't shared by Kim Young-Sam, a
co-leader of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party who joined
him on the eight-day mission to Moscow. Mr. Kim, an
opposition leader until January, said he had discussed the
timing of normalization with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and is convinced that diplomatic ties are likely
this year, perhaps as early as June.
   But Mr. Park, who carried an exchange of personal messages
between Messrs. Roh and Gorbachev, warned against such
"excessive optimism." He said there are no positive signs
that normalization will come swiftly because Moscow, besides
trying to avoid offending Pyongyang, is preoccupied with
domestic problems.
   Korean Foreign Ministry officials attribute the
differences of opinion to a strong rivalry between Messrs.
Park and Kim. Both men, the officials say, want to claim
credit for a breakthrough in Seoul-Moscow relations.
   The ministry officials said the official Korean position
is that the two countries should enter into full-blown
ambassador-level relations without conditions or interim
steps. But they said Seoul will consider a Soviet
counterproposal that the two countries open
consulates-general before establishing full relations.
   Until a breakthrough is made on formal diplomatic
relations, Korean officials say, economic relations will be
restricted to small investments and modest trade accords.
