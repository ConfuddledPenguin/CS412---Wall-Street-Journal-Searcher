   NEW YORK -- To hear Wall Street tell it, investors in TCBY
Enterprises should positively be doing cartwheels over the
impending entry of two giant fast-food companies into the
frozen yogurt business.
   TCBY, a Little Rock, Ark., chain that now dominates the
frozen yogurt market, already is in a war with smaller
yogurt-chains and with Baskin-Robbins. In May, International
Dairy Queen will roll out a frozen yogurt product in 2,200
stores. And that same month, McDonald's plans to go
nationwide with a similar product in 8,000 outlets.

   Wall Street, however, isn't fazed. "The fact that
McDonald's is replacing ice cream with frozen yogurt sends a
clear message that frozen yogurt is bullish," says Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst Caroline Levy. Yogurt, she says, has
captured only 14% of the frozen dessert market. With
McDonald's pushing it, the market is certain to expand. "If
someone tries a frozen yogurt in McDonalds," she adds,
"eventually they will become a TCBY customer."
   With its shares trading at 18 times trailing per-share
earnings and at five times book value, TCBY will need new
customers. In fact, the stock is trading at nearly four times
sales. Those are growth-stock multiples. The question is
whether the business is maturing. In its past fiscal year,
ended in November, sales in TCBY stores open at least 12
months rose by an ample, but hardly explosive, 3.6%. Sales in
stores open at least 24 months rose only 2%. And in the first
quarter of this year, same-store sales fell 8%. The company
blames bad weather in December (January and February were
mild) and a tough comparison with an unusually good quarter
last year.
   Analysts are believers. The Street is estimating that
TCBY's earnings growth will resume, and that net for the year
will outstrip last year's net by 30%.
   The bullish case is that TCBY has established a distinct
product and a dominant market share (roughly 34%). Its
customers can choose from among 50 flavors -- from white
chocolate mousse to pumpkin -- of which half a dozen are
available on any day, and a variety of toppings. McDonald's
restaurants will serve only one or two flavors.
   According to market research, one third of all Americans
have yet to savor their first frozen yogurt. And according to
bulls, there are only two types of Americans: those who eat
frozen yogurt now, and those who will. "We know there is
competition," Ms. Levy says. "We are simply betting that the
market is growing."
   The party line at TCBY is similarly jubilant. The chain
has close to 1,700 stores, mostly franchised, and plans to go
to 2,000 by November. "I don't think it will adversely impact
us," a spokeswoman says of the mushrooming competition. "If
anything, it broadens the market. Our plans are to continue
growing."
   It is possible, of course, that TCBY is planning a party
to celebrate its rush of good news. But don't bet on it.
   TCBY has recently had to deal with unrest among
franchisees, some of whom complained that TCBY was charging
them too high a price for its yogurt. Prices at McDonald's
are expected to be lower, analysts say, putting more pressure
on TCBY's price. At a suburban Atlanta TCBY, for instance, a
small yogurt is $1.09 and a medium-sized portion is $1.51,
plus 30 cents for a topping. McDonald's prices are expected
to be in the vicinity of 70 cents.
   Frozen yogurt executives say TCBY and other frozen yogurt
chains have more to fear from restaurants that specialize in
ice cream, such as Dairy Queen and Baskin-Robbins, than from
McDonald's, because ice cream is a natural competitor to
frozen yogurt.
   "If a Dairy Queen opens across the street from a TCBY,
they could take half its business," says Jeffrey Frankel,
president of Dallas-based I Love Yogurt. And as more Dairy
Queens promote yogurt there will be less room for new TCBY
franchises.
   But, Mr. Frankel says, "people aren't going to go to
McDonald's for yogurt." Analysts, in general, say the Golden
Arches are a turn-off to health-conscious yogurt lovers.
   They are, perhaps, writing off the nation's No. 1
fast-food chain too quickly. McDonald's is unmatched as a
marketer, and if it chooses to redefine itself in the
direction of yogurt eaters, people will take notice. And by
all appearances, some such redefinition is in place.
   McDonald's also plans to introduce lower-calorie shakes,
fruit sorbets and apple bran muffins. A spokesman says "our
mission is to respond to customer tastes in an evolutionary
way, not in a revolutionary way. People are eating a little
lighter and keeping an eye on their health." It is hardly
news that people are eating lighter, but when McDonald's
notices, that is news indeed. Regardless of what they say in
public, it's a good bet that competitors -- in yogurt and
other products -- agree.
