   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Computer Sciences Corp. said it won
renewal of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
contract valued at as much as $65.7 million for engineering
support services at the agency's Wallops Island, Va.,
experimental facility.
   The contract calls for payments of $23 million for an
initial two years. Annual extensions after that can boost the
contract to five years' duration and maximum value. The work
includes support for NASA's rocket, balloon, aeronautical and
launch-range programs at Wallops Island.
