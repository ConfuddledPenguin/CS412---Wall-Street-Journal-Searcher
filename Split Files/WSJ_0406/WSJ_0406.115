   TOKYO -- Takuya Iwasaki is president of one of Japan's
biggest brokerage houses, Nikko Securities Co. So his
subordinates were astonished two weeks ago when he barely
mentioned the Tokyo stock market's recent nose dive in a
speech to Nikko managers.
   Mr. Iwasaki may have dodged it then, but the crash of what
had been the world's richest stock market is sure to consume
a lot more of his time in the future. The 27% decline in the
market's value since the start of the year will shake up
Japan's powerful securities industry, analysts and industry
insiders agree.

   Rumors that the collapse in share prices might bring down
a Japanese securities house shook Wall Street on Wednesday
and carried stocks sharply lower early Thursday in Tokyo,
before they recovered. A number of big stock-market
speculators are said to be in financial trouble because of
their exposure to the market, but analysts say any associated
losses will be spread among enough securities firms to
prevent any bankruptcies.
   Nonetheless, profits could be cut in half in the coming
year at Japan's biggest securities houses, including Nikko.
Smaller firms may be forced into mergers. Banks, until now
all but banned from the securities industry, may be allowed
to slip into the business under the guise of helping troubled
brokers.
   And U.S. and European securities firms, which have been
making big strides in the Tokyo market over the past half
decade, will face stiff competitive challenges. In the wake
of the Tokyo market's plunge, profit-hungry Japanese
securities firms will try to expand into selling foreign
stocks, doing computer-assisted program trading and offering
more securities research -- areas until now dominated by
foreign houses.
   "There's a bear market in Japan," says Richard Greer,
managing director in Tokyo of Baring Securities Co., a
London-based firm that has made its reputation and about 60%
of its profits by specializing in Japanese investments.
"Liquidity is gone," he says. "Interest is waning. Investors
are going to need persuading to stay in the market."
   "It's going to be very difficult to make a buck out there
in 1990," says J. Brian Waterhouse, a financial analyst at
James Capel &amp; Co., a British brokerage house.
   Few professionals expect layoffs of the sort that have
ravaged the securities industry on Wall Street and in the
City of London. In harmony-conscious Japan, firings aren't
likely to become common. Still, the financial consequences of
an atrophying stock market will be severe for an industry
that has seen its clout expand globally in recent years.
   Just how severe isn't clear yet. Securities companies in
Japan are notoriously shy about discussing their fortunes,
and few executives would talk on the record about their
industry. But based on a review of the industry's results in
the six months ended last Sept. 30, some analysts are
concluding that the market crash could halve the profits of
Japan's Big Four securities firms.
   That would be an abrupt reversal for the companies --
Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Yamaichi
Securities Co. and Nikko -- all of which have predicted
record earnings for the year that ended last Saturday, March
31. Those results aren't out yet. But, thanks to a strong
year in the first three quarters of its financial year, most
analysts expect Nomura, the biggest securities firm in the
world, to report consolidated net profits for a second year
running of more than 240 billion yen ($1.5 billion).
   Nomura officials declined to discuss their operations,
however those figures would make it the most profitable
financial company in the world.
   The turmoil in Japan's financial markets this year could
end that success. "In a severe market downturn, where
everything goes to hell, Nomura could still make huge
profits," says Robert G. Zielinski, a financial analyst at
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. "But there's no question all
the securities firms will be hurt by a prolonged bear
market."
   Among the Japanese stocks that have fallen most in recent
days have been those of the major securities companies. Since
the end of last year, Daiwa's share price has fallen 45.3%,
Yamaichi's has dropped 43.8%, Nikko's is off 44.1% and
Nomura's has lost 45.7%.
   A breakdown of the revenues of Japan's Big Four houses
shows that they are highly dependent on three basic sources
of income: stock and bond trading commissions; stock and bond
underwriting commissions; and in-house trading of securities.
The market's decline, concedes a senior executive at Daiwa,
"will have a big impact."
   As Tokyo stock-market volatility has increased this year,
trading volume has fallen by nearly half from a year ago.
That means that commission income is sharply lower.
Underwriting fees have dried up, largely because of a
self-imposed ban by the securities industry on new issues of
stocks and equity-linked bonds. The ban was intended to prop
up the market by forcing money into existing shares, not
newly issued securities. "About 2.3 trillion yen in new
issues disappeared overnight, and that's a lot of gravy,"
says James Capel's Mr. Waterhouse.
   Even in-house trading revenues will fall sharply because
of the evaporation of one of the hottest profit centers for
Japanese securities companies: warrants. Warrants are sold
together with corporate bonds, usually issued in the
deregulated Euromarkets. They give the holder the right to
buy the issuer's stock at a set price by a specified date.
Because the Japanese firms arranged most warrant-bond issues
for companies here, they were able to hold on to warrants
until the instruments were "in the money," or profitable, and
then sell them to retail clients for an easy profit.
   Analysts estimate the Big Four made as much as one-third
of their profit from the warrant market in the fiscal year
ended March 31. Now that stocks are falling, though, trading
activity in the $50 billion warrant market has nearly
disappeared.
   Japan's individual investors haven't been big sellers of
stock yet, instead they are holding on to their shares in
hopes of a rebound. But there are few buyers, and many people
who keep their savings in stock mutual funds are shifting the
money into fixed-income accounts.
   That hurts the Japanese securities industry. Of the 272
firms that belong to the Japan Securities Dealers'
Association, more than 200 depend almost entirely on retail,
or individual-investor, brokerage and investment-trust
business.
   As a result, some firms may retrench. Norio Watanabe, a
strategist at the Credit Suisse Bank, predicts that if hard
times continue, Japanese authorities may take the opportunity
of the market's decline to force some small houses into
mergers with one another.
   Even the government's own Financial System Research
Council often has hinted at the need for consolidation of
Japan's sprawling retail securities industry; the crash might
give the country's powerful Finance Ministry the impetus to
bring it about.
   But authorities are wary of splicing small firms together
with the Big Four houses, which already dominate as much as
two-thirds of many securities businesses. As a result, some
analysts speculate that the ministry might try to match
troubled small securities houses with Japanese banks.
