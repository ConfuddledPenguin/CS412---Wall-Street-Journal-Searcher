   WASHINGTON -- After a one-month court hold on the
thrift-industry restructuring, government regulators seized
Colony Savings Bank, Monaca, Pa., an insolvent thrift with
assets of $451 million.
   It was the first government seizure of an insolvent S&amp;L
since Olympic Federal Savings &amp; Loan, Berwyn, Ill., won a
round of court cases March 7. The Office of Thrift
Supervision said Colony was operating in an unsafe and
unsound condition, and suffered losses related to securities
trading and commercial real-estate lending. Colony will
continue operating under government management.

   The court case rested on the fact that the director of the
thrift office hadn't been confirmed by the Senate, as
required by the Constitution. On Wednesday, the Senate
confirmed Timothy Ryan for the post, and he will be sworn in
Monday, apparently making the court decision moot.
   Separately today, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, is expected to disclose its
latest estimate of how much the thrift bailout may cost over
10 years. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust
Corp., the S&amp;L bailout agency, has already estimated that
another $25 billion will have to be piled onto the $166
billion estimated by the Bush administration. Congressional
sources expect the GAO estimate to be much higher.
