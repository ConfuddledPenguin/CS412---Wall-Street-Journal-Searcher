   Augusta, Ga. -- America is a relatively young country that
prizes innovation, so it's no wonder that we are short on
tradition in many areas, including sports. For instance, our
newly crowned collegiate basketball champion, the University
of Nevada-Las Vegas, has been in existence for so brief a
period that its hoops coach, Jerry Tarkanian, can quip that
"our alumni didn't go there."
   One institution, though, does its best to make up for this
lack. That would be the Masters Golf Tournament, which
convened in earnest again here yesterday. The Masters marks
its 56th anniversary this annum -- not a long history in the
Royal-Pain &amp; Ancient Game. But, like a good golf swing, it
thrives on repetition.

   The Masters has its traditional green jacket, which
distinguishes members of the host Augusta National Golf Club
from hoi polloi. It goes against the current grain by
requesting, with surprising effect, that spectators limit
their vocalizing to the encouragement of participants. It
insists that TV cables be wrapped in green to harmonize with
the outdoor decor, and bans advertising symbols, down to the
product names on concession-stand soft-drink and beer
spigots.
   Even when things change here, they remain the same.
Augusta National this year unveiled a bright, roomy press
center to replace the gloomy, barracks-like structure that
had served the purpose for many years. But the press snack
bar still dispenses the worst sandwiches in Christendom.
   The nicest Masters tradition has to do with respect for
excellence past: It's the one major tournament in golf -- or
any other big-time sport, for that matter -- that extends a
lifetime invitation to its former champions. They can come
and play a lot, or play a little, or just watch. The latter
is no small privilege at an event whose $90, four-day tickets
are available only to longtime subscribers or those willing
to pay scalpers upward of $1,500.
   The upshot is that spectators can witness rare meetings of
golf's generations. At Wednesday afternoon's par-three
tournament, they applauded 77-year-old Sam Snead, the 1949,
'52 and '54 winner, and 67-year-old Doug Ford ('57) along
with current heroes, and later on the practice range watched
77-year-old Byron Nelson ('37 and '42) appraise the tee shots
of Tom Watson ('77 and '81). "Tom's working on his fade, and
wanted to know what I thought," explained Nelson to people
who asked.
   The Masters honors its past winners with an annual
pre-tourney dinner, at which the defending titlist gets to
dictate a menu item. Britisher Nick Faldo picked
steak-and-kidney pie for this week's feed. Then, those who
wish to can tee it up with the big boys, unencumbered by any
euphemism for over-the-hill.
   To be sure, some "seniors" don't regard their appearances
as merely sentimental. One such is six-time champ Jack
Nicklaus, who just celebrated his passing of age 50 (gasp])
by winning his first start on golf's burgeoning seniors tour.
He declared on Wednesday that, newly liberated from back
ills, he's not playing this one for exercise.
   "I'm hitting the ball better than I have at any time since
the '70s," said the man who usually scored in the 60s during
that decade. "Realistically, I suppose I'm a long shot here,
but I think I can win."
   Darlin' Jack thrilled the multitudes with his
come-from-behind victory here in 1986 at the athletically
advanced age of 46, but that hasn't been the only geriatic
highlight on these beflowered acres. Snead, the game's wonder
as both boy and old boy, was a top-10 finisher in 1967 at age
54, and won the par-three tourney seven years later. Claude
Harmon ('48) fired back-to-back holes-in-one in the 1968
par-three event at age 52. Jimmy Demaret ('40, '47, '50) tied
for fifth in the tourney proper in 1962, at 51. Gene Sarazen,
winner of the second Masters, in 1935, shot a pair of 74s in
1962, when he was 60.
   Even when no such feats are envisioned, some ex-champs
look forward with relish to tackling Augusta National. "I'll
play here as long as I can walk," said Ford, who at age 67
was the oldest man slated to compete yesterday. "This place
is so beautiful, I hate to just come and watch."
   Nelson, golf's "Lord Byron" of the 1940s, thinks so too;
he played in the tourney proper until 1966, and in the
par-three until last year. For the past several years, he,
Snead and Sarazen played nine holes as the Masters'
ceremonial starting threesome, but a hip ailment worsened
last summer and relegated him to spectator status. Sarazen,
still swinging at 87, and Snead were scheduled to go it alone
yesterday.
   "I didn't bring my clubs this time," Nelson said on
Wednesday. "Didn't want to get tempted."
   Still, the Roanoke, Texas, rancher said he wouldn't miss
taking a journey he has made annually since 1935 save for the
years in which his first wife, Louise, was ill. "This course
is different -- it was special the year it opened," he said.
"Credit Bobby Jones, who built it, for that. He knew as much
golf history as he knew the game, which was a lot."
   Nelson went on to say that the Masters was important to
his personal history as well. "I still rank my 1937 win here
as my favorite," he said. "We didn't talk about `majors'
then, but it was one of my first important victories. I'd
just been named pro of a club in Reading, Pa., and my prize
money -- $1,200 -- outfitted my pro shop. I think I played my
best golf ever when I won again in '42. I was three shots
down to Ben Hogan after five holes, but came back to beat
him, 69-70. Had an eagle at eight (a par-five)."
   The reunion aspect of the tourney is "nice," he said, even
though the definition of what constitutes an old-timer
constantly changes. "Sam, Gene, Henry Picard ('38) and Herman
Keiser ('46) are about the only ones left from my era, except
for Hogan ('51 and '53), who doesn't come. But lately Jack
Burke Jr. ('56) and Arnie Palmer ('58, '60, '62 and '64) have
joined us," he smiled.
   "But it's the whole thing -- the event, the people, the
place. This would be the most beautiful park in the world if
they didn't use it for golf. Wouldn't be spring without it."
