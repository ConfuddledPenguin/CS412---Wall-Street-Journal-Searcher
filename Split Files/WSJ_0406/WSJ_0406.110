   TORONTO -- Onex Corp. said its 80%-owned unit, Hidden
Creek Industries, completed the acquisition of Tate &amp; Lyle
PLC's North American auto parts business for US$179.5

preferred stock bought by Tate &amp; Lyle, subordinate notes and
senior bank debt. Automotive Industries makes plastic parts
for major North American auto makers.
