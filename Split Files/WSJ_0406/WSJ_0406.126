   Burger King Corp. is finally talking profits, not
problems.
   The hamburger chain's new owner, Grand Metropolitan PLC of
Britain, is optimistic Burger King will contribute to its
bottom line this year.

   "We're proving the validity of this acquisition," says
Burger King's chief financial officer, Robert Stetson.
   A year-long overhaul has touched everything from the
number of franchisees to the detergents used to clean the
kitchens. Determined to distinguish Burger King, the nation's
second-largest burger chain, from the competition, Grand Met
has launched aggressive promotional efforts, such as the
current one with popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
videotapes. Even small details are getting great attention.
For instance, Burger King recently said it would replace its
house salad dressing with actor Paul Newman's name brand.
   But even though Burger King just completed its best
quarter in three years, with profit up 25%, management
concedes it's too early to proclaim a total turnaround for
the unit, which was acquired along with Pillsbury Co. last
year. The words "turnaround and transformation signify fast,
almost violent changes in direction, which aren't
appropriate," says Barry Gibbons, the British-born retailing
whiz recruit brought in last year to rebuild the Miami-based
fast-food business, whose profits sagged under Pillsbury.
   "They're just starting," agrees Emanuel Goldman, a
PaineWebber Inc. restaurant-industry analyst.
   Mr. Goldman believes Burger King must turn unique assets
into competitive advantages, and he cites three examples: One
is Burger King's ability to customize its foods, as touted in
the once-successful "Have It Your Way" campaign. It's
something that archrival McDonald's doesn't do. Another is
the fact that Burger King broils its burgers rather than
fries them as McDonald's does, a potential edge amid growing
public consciousness about cholesterol and fats. Finally, the
analyst says, "the fact that the company had been so grossly
mismanaged" under Pillsbury's ownership makes improvement
that much easier. "We're not dealing with a better
semiconductor chip," Mr. Goldman says. "This is basic stuff."
   But the rapid stream of changes and the company's demands
for modernizations at the restaurants have bruised some
franchisees, the backbone of Burger King's 6,200-store
domestic system. Some complain of the burden those changes
have put on franchisees. "They've not done one thing to
reduce our costs," gripes one Midwest franchisee.
   Mr. Gibbons promises that further planned changes should
help reduce operators' overhead. He points to an experiment
with countertop computers where customers will punch in their
orders, then pay with the swipe of a credit card. The
intention is to reduce order errors, speed food delivery and
shrink the store crew size.
   Labor-saving devices also will modernize Burger King
kitchens. "We shouldn't be chopping lettuce in the
restaurant," says Gary Langstaff, executive vice president of
marketing. He and others see technology helping the company
refocus the 270,000-strong store personnel on service.
   Too many operators have concentrated on "what's easiest
for the restaurant, not what's best for the customers," Mr.
Langstaff says. "The focus should be on the entire eating
experience, which includes service as well as food."
   As part of the service slant, the company wants to add
more of a personal touch. As reported, the chain soon will
test high-tech drive-through windows featuring better sound
systems and video screens that allow the customer to see the
order taker.
   Mr. Gibbons wasted little time in changing things. In a
memo his first day on the job -- written before breakfast, he
says -- the executive said earnings were "a mess" and costs
required "urgent work." Soon hundreds of employees were let
go and several management layers stripped away. What had been
a billion-dollar food purchasing and distribution system
underwent radical surgery.
   Work also began on product introductions. With one million
sales a day, the new BK Broiler chicken sandwich already is
challenging Burger King's Whopper hamburger for star billing
on the menu. The company's Kids' Club received a similarly
popular reception; several million youngsters signed up.
Meanwhile, "mystery shoppers" -- essentially spies from
headquarters -- prowled stores looking for problems, and
operators took thousands of calls on an 800 number
established for customer feedback.
   Already nearly 100 franchisees have been dropped, on the
ground that they didn't meet the company's standards. Company
managers stopped renewing leases for what Mr. Gibbons calls
"some of the worst operators in the business."
   Joseph Angel, a franchisee in Portland, Ore., says the
result of the rapid-fire overhaul has been "to get the
consistency of operations and product back on the front
burner." Adds Richard Fors, a Buffalo, N.Y., multi-store
franchisee who heads the chain's National Franchisee
Association: "There's stability in the system for the first
time in years. We used to think no one in the corporation was
listening."
   But franchisees are still grumbling over Burger King's
decision to take marketing money away from local promotions
in favor of national advertising campaigns. Also, Mr.
Langstaff's "Sometimes You Gotta Break the Rules" marketing
tagline remains controversial; one franchisee questions its
appropriateness given today's concern with drug abuse and
juvenile delinquency.
   Although he agrees that previous management "panicked"
over marketing -- failing to introduce new products while it
reeled through an embarrassing series of faux pax, including
the infamous Herb the Nerd advertising campaign -- Mr.
Gibbons prefers not to talk about Burger King's past
problems. "As far as I'm concerned, they're history."
   Ever upbeat, Mr. Gibbons likens the company to a
professional golfer whose game went into a slump. "We're a
great name on the tour. We've had a couple of years off the
leader board, no question. But with a new sponsor and a few
new clubs, we're back."
