   AMERICAN REALTY TRUST Inc., citing a decline in its cash
flow, cut its quarterly to 20 cents a share from 38 cents,
payable May 15 to shares of record April 30. The real estate
investment trust said in Dallas that its cash flow has
diminished over the past few months as Southmark Corp.
affiliates have halted payments on five mortgages held by the
company. American Realty said it has foreclosed on two of the
properties and has plans to sell one of those. However, it
said that working out the remaining loans is expected to hurt
its cash flow for the rest of the year. Still, American
Realty said it doesn't expect to cut its distribution further
this year.
