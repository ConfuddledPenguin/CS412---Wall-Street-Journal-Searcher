   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. agreed to
transfer part of its Boston Co. money-management unit to a
new joint venture, a move that will raise more than $10
million for Shearson.
   In a move that was expected, Shearson, a securities-firm
unit of American Express Co., said it would transfer about $6
billion of Boston Co.'s money-management business into a new
joint venture with Nippon Life Insurance Co.

   The joint venture, in which Nippon will hold a 50% stake,
will be called PanAgora Asset Management Inc. and be based in
Boston. A related PanAgora joint venture was established last
year in London.
   Shearson said it will receive compensation from Nippon in
exchange for the asset transfer. The amount of the
compensation wasn't disclosed, but individuals in the
industry said it was probably $10 million to $15 million.
   The part of Boston Co. being transferred to the PanAgora
venture is its Structured Investment Products Group, which
specializes in so-called index funds, asset allocation and
research for institutional investors.
   Shearson has been trying to cut costs and replenish its
capital. The securities firm on Monday said it expects to
report a first-quarter loss of $897 million to $917 million,
a securities-industry record, mainly because of charges it
will take to pay for office closings and other parts of its
big retrenchment plan. Included in the expected first-quarter
loss, Shearson said, is $25 million in reserves for losses
primarily on loans made by Boston Co.
   Nippon has had a 13% interest in Shearson since 1987
through its holding of Shearson preferred stock. That
interest will decline to approximately 8% when American
Express completes a plan in which it will buy the rest of
Shearson's common stock outstanding.
