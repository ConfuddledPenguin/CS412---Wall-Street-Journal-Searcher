   Major railroads muddled through the first quarter with
mixed results and a growing consensus that modest economic
growth has resumed.
   The railroads said a surge in coal and grain traffic
partly offset the continued weakness in industrial freight.
Moreover, they said, aggressive cost-cutting and moderate
winter weather tempered the effects of declines in high-value
freight, particularly metals and automobiles. Rail analysts
even said slumping auto shipments appeared to have turned
upward at the end of the quarter.

   Analysts expect Consolidated Rail Corp., which relies
heavily on automobiles, to post a steep first-quarter
earnings drop. They said Conrail should earn between 60 cents
and 65 cents a share, compared with 88 cents in the
year-earlier period.
   But analysts expect sharply higher first quarter earnings
at Burlington Northern Inc., which derives about 50% of its
revenue from coal and grain. They predict that Burlington
Northern will earn between 70 cents and 80 cents a share.
That compares with 44 cents in the year-earlier quarter,
which was hurt by severe winter weather on the railroad's
Chicago-Seattle route.
   "The economy has been stronger than expected. I was
looking for rail traffic to be down 3% in the first quarter,
and it looks as if traffic will actually be up slightly,"
said Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Co. "The
surprise element has been the spurt in coal and grain."
   Overall rail carloadings at the major railroads were up
less than 1%, according to the Association of American
Railroads. Shipments of coal rose 6.5%, reflecting strong
utility purchases, and grain was up about 2%, because of
robust export sales. But carloadings of higher-value freight
were generally down, with motor vehicles declining 19.7%,
metal products 1.6%, lumber 5% and paper products 3.2%.
   Some analysts were cheered by first-quarter carload
levels, which followed traffic declines of more than 3% in
each of the last two quarters. In addition, automotive
shipments began to improve toward the end of the quarter.
   "The industry has weathered yet another recession, which
was short, shallow and centered on the automotive industry,"
said Andras Petery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "It
was short because it got under way in May 1989, and it looks
like we are coming out of it now."
   Anthony Hatch, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said
cost-reduction measures at the major railroads also helped
the industry through the slowdown. "It's been a cyclically
tough period, and the railroads have handled it reasonably
well," he said. Mr. Hatch predicted modest rail traffic gains
in the second quarter against the year-ago period, when
traffic levels flattened.
   But not everyone is confident about the rail industry
outlook. "Obviously things are better than they were, but I'm
not sure we're out of the woods yet," said Ms. Lidgerwood,
the First Boston analyst. She added that first-quarter
carloads, excluding coal and grain, were actually down 2.8%.
And she said the recent improvement in automobile carloadings
"could be a fluke. I don't know if it will be sustained."
   CSX Corp., the first of the rail group to release results,
reported early this week that its first-quarter net income
declined to $77 million from the year-earlier $82 million.
This year's first quarter included a net gain of $52 million
from disposal of CSX's natural gas liquids processing unit.
The company said strong coal, grain and fertilizer traffic on
its railroad more than offset weakness in automobiles and
metals. However, rail expenses increased as a result of
higher diesel fuel prices and an expanded locomotive repair
program to upgrade the company's fleet. In addition, a $33
million after-tax restructuring charge at the company's ocean
ship company, Sea-Land Service, hurt CSX's first-quarter
earnings.
   Although Conrail declined to comment on analysts'
projections, a company spokesman acknowledged its
first-quarter results were affected by a decline in traffic
and an "unfavorable" traffic mix. He added that Conrail
carried higher volumes of lower-revenue freight such as coal,
and lower volumes of higher-revenue freight such as autos and
auto parts.
   The Conrail spokesman also said lower levels of interest
income and higher levels of interest expense related to the
company's recent purchases of its own stock will affect the
results.
   Norfolk Southern Corp. declined to comment on analysts'
projections that its first-quarter earnings will be flat or
slightly down compared with net of 75 cents a share a year
ago. Although Norfolk Southern benefited from the improvement
in coal, its chief commodity, the company was hurt by the
slowdown in auto shipments.
   Union Pacific Corp. officials said first-quarter earnings
are likely to be up "slightly" compared with net of $1.22 a
share in the year-earlier period. They said earnings at the
company's rail unit will also be up "slightly," reflecting
higher coal and chemical shipments, increased labor
productivity and an approximately 1% increase in average
price levels. Shipment levels, which were weak early in the
quarter, improved by the end of the quarter. "Six weeks ago
we were a lot more worried about a recession this year," said
a Union Pacific official. "Now, it doesn't look like a
recession to us in 1990. It looks like growth, but very slow
growth."
   The company said first-quarter earnings of its natural
resource business will increase between 25% and 30%,
reflecting higher volumes and prices of oil and gas. But
Union Pacific's trucking unit, Overnite Transportation Co.,
will post reduced earnings, because of higher fuel, labor and
benefit costs and industry-wide rate cutting.
