   FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it will join four
West German companies to invest 750 million marks ($441.3
million) in a 50-50 joint venture it has formed with
Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, to update and expand
the Moscow airport, Sheremetjevo I.
   West Germany's national air carrier, which is 51%
government owned, announced a year earlier that it had signed
a letter of intent for the project. Feasibility studies were
made during the past 11 months.

   The Sheremetjevo I airport in Moscow, as well as other
Soviet airports in the future, will be modernized, expanded
and operated by the joint venture. The 750 million marks will
be used to expand and update a passenger terminal in Moscow,
to build an international freight terminal, to build a
waiting hall and to build an airport hotel.
   In addition to Lufthansa, partners in the venture will
include electronics concern AEG AG, Flughafen Frankfurt am
Main, Salzgitter subsidiary Noell G.m.b.H and Dresdner Bank
AG.
   Lufthansa also said it received a comprehensive
maintenance contract to service the fleet of Airbus planes
owned by Aeroflot. Lufthansa didn't disclose financial
details of its new Aeroflot service contract.
