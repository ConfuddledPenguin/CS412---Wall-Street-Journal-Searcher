   WASHINGTON -- In the face of spreading opposition to his
budget, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney counterattacked by
calling for sharply reduced congressional control over the
details of Pentagon spending.
   The sweeping proposals by Mr. Cheney take aim at some of
the most cherished prerogatives of lawmakers, including
annual authorization of big-ticket weapons purchases and
line-item review of the entire Pentagon budget. The package
also contains specific legislative proposals to make it
easier for the Pentagon to encourage or force thousands of
officers out of active service as military spending shrinks
in the next few years.

   Many of the radical ideas, especially at a time of
escalating bipartisan criticism of Mr. Cheney, are almost
certain to languish in Congress.
   But by focusing attention on lawmakers' own shortcomings
and parochial concerns in shaping the defense budget, Mr.
Cheney apparently hopes to build public support for the Bush
administration's beleaguered spending blueprint.
   Urging Congress to concentrate on "broad missions rather
than on individual items of hardware," Mr. Cheney told
reporters that the current system often leads to continual
battles over which congressional districts benefit from
weapons contracts. "If next year's budget debate is only a
few days away from the end of this year's debate," he said,
lawmakers have "no reason to accept a negative decision as
final."
   Barely two hours earlier, however, two of Mr. Cheney's
former allies in the GOP deserted his budget proposal. Sens.
John McCain of Arizona and William Cohen of Maine, both
important swing votes on the Armed Services Committee, called
for defense cuts about twice as large as those proposed by
the White House through 1995.
   Mr. Cheney's most controversial proposals, if enacted,
would fundamentally change the relationship between the
military and the defense industry. One section of his
proposed legislation, for instance, envisions a major
curtailing of on-site government monitoring at selected major
weapons plants.
   Instead of "assuming there is a dishonest atmosphere out
there," Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood said, the
Pentagon wants to test the concept of "reducing the degree of
inspections and audits that we put on these contractors."
Pentagon critics, including members of the House leadership,
are almost certain to keep such proposals from reaching the
floor.
   Mr. Cheney, who repeatedly said his proposals weren't
intended to set up confrontations with lawmakers, tried in
other ways to placate Congress. He confirmed that the Navy's
Seawolf nuclear attack submarines and Arleigh Burke-class
destroyers, which carry a total price tag of about $40
billion, have been included in a previously reported review
of the Pentagon's most expensive high-technology weapons.
