   Your March 7 Law-column item seems to imply that the State
Bar of Michigan had somehow sought to influence the
disposition of a now-dismissed complaint against its
president-elect. Complaints against lawyers in Michigan are
handled by an agency appointed for that purpose by the
Michigan Supreme Court, which is funded from state-bar dues.
No one outside the discipline agency even knew of the
existence of the complaint file. Even our president-elect,
who was the target, did not learn of its existence until the
incident was disclosed in a newspaper article long after the
file had been closed. Consequently, it was not possible for
the State Bar of Michigan to seek to influence the
disposition of the complaint, the existence of which was not
known. Further, the state bar has no control over the
operations of the Attorney Grievance Commission.
