   NEW YORK -- Bobby Orbach, who turned discounter 47th
Street Photo into one of the nation's biggest independent
computer retailers, said he is leaving to start a new
software-related business.
   Mr. Orbach, 37 years old, who joined closely held 47th
Street in 1981 as a calculator salesman, spearheaded the
discounter's move into computers. Retail industry sources
estimate that last year 47th Street sold about $130 million
of computers and had total revenue of over $300 million.

   Mr. Orbach managed the unlikely feat of making 47th Street
a major supplier of computers and software to big corporate
and government offices in the New York area. Although
computer and software companies once shunned 47th Street as
an unauthorized, gray-market discounter, many began to deal
with the retailer when it became a major outlet.
   Before getting into computers, 47th Street was primarily a
camera retailer, famous for low prices, high decibel
order-takers and Saturday closings (in keeping with the
Orthodox Jewish traditions of its owner and employees).
Irving Goldstein, owner of 47th Street, said the company
"regretfully accepted the resignation." Mr. Orbach said he
expects to announce his new venture by the end of May.
