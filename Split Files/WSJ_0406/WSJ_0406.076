   Petroleum prices fell sharply on worries of a possible
supply glut.
   Prices of European and Middle East crude oils dropped as
much as 25 cents a barrel -- some falling for the second
straight day. In the U.S., futures prices of crude oil
plunged as much as 45 cents a barrel while refiners rushed to
reduce field postings by 50 cents.

   "The problem is a buildup in excess supply," said Philip
Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for
International Economics and an authority on oil-price
behavior. "OPEC is not cutting production enough," he added.
   Oil prices had been expected to soften some in the second
quarter, which is traditionally a sluggish demand period. But
this week's declines are earlier -- and far larger -- than
had been expected.
   The declines began Wednesday in the wake of a Wall Street
Journal article on a rise in production by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and after industry reports
that crude oil inventories in the U.S. are expanding faster
than anticipated. OPEC production now is at the highest level
in eight years, and U.S. crude oil inventories are the
largest in at least two years.
   Most oil prices now are below those of a year ago when
they were rising because of fallout from the Alaskan oil
spill and from North Sea production mishaps. Prices of a few
crudes still are near $20 a barrel, but most are below that
psychologically important level.
   In European spot markets yesterday, North Sea Brent for
May delivery was down 20 cents a barrel to $18.10, according
to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. In U.S.
futures trading, the May contract for West Texas
Intermediate, or WTI, fell 35 cents to settle at $19.43 a
barrel. And new field postings for this U.S. benchmark crude
generally are $18.75 a barrel.
   "As it cracks $20, WTI is the last indicator {among the
world's benchmark crudes} to reflect global fundamentals,"
said William H. Brown III, international oil analyst at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Until now, Mr. Brown and other analysts added, WTI has
continued to hold relatively firm -- even as prices of other
crudes eroded -- because it is a light "sweet" crude that is
low in sulfur content. These crudes are best for yielding
preferred fuels such as gasoline.
   Most of the pricing pressure has been on the "sour" crudes
-- those that are high in sulfur and often are very dense
such as the heavy crudes of the Middle East. With Kuwait and
some other Middle East members of OPEC producing beyond their
quotas, the heavy and high-sulfur crudes have been pouring
into the market. Some countries such as Iraq, Iran and Saudi
Arabia are understood to be offering steep discounts to some
customers to maintain their market shares.
   "The big overhang {in inventories} is in the sour crudes,"
said Marshall Thomas, editor in chief of the Oil Daily.
   Despite the surplus of sour crudes, West Texas
Intermediate and other light crudes still would have held
firm in price if the gasoline market had remained as strong
as expected, analysts said. But there suddenly are signs of
new weakness in the gasoline market.
   As a result, prices of gasoline are coming down, at least
at the wholesale level. The futures price of unleaded
gasoline for May delivery fell 1.57 cents a gallon on the New
York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, settling at 63.29 cents.
The June contract fell 1.71 cents to 62.16 cents.
   "We are looking for a decline in gasoline demand this
year," said Mr. Brown of Kidder Peabody.
