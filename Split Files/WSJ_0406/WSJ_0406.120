   WASHINGTON -- The National Mediation Board ordered a
30-day cooling-off period in the deadlocked railroad labor
negotiations.
   The order blocks any strike at least until midnight May 5.
It is another step in the strike-stopping procedures of the
Railway Labor Act, under which the White House would
eventually name an emergency panel that would develop
recommendations for solving the health-cost issues and other
matters in dispute. White House officials have said that
President Bush is willing to name the emergency panel.

   The president may name the panel as soon as the Mediation
Board notifies the White House that the negotiating impasse
threatens to disrupt interstate commerce. That notification
is likely to occur soon.
   An emergency panel usually has 30 days to come up with
settlement recommendations, but the railroads and the unions
say they would allow until Sept. 15, and longer if necessary.
The parties also agreed they wouldn't take any action until
30 days after the emergency board reports, and in any event
won't act if Congress isn't in session. Congress typically
intervenes if the Railway Labor Act fails to prevent a
strike.
