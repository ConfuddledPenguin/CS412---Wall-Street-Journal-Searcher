   NEW YORK -- Who owns stock quotes?
   That's the issue at the heart of a dispute raging behind
the scenes between the New York Stock Exchange and a group of
about a dozen brokerage firms and media companies.

   The Big Board and seven other securities exchanges, in a
proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission, have
asked for a technical change that would give them the right
to charge fees for "delayed" stock-price quotations. That's
the common way that the investing public gets its stock-price
information through electronic data bases and newspapers.
   These stock quotes, which are delayed 15 minutes, have
traditionally been made available free of charge by the
exchanges. By contrast, the exchanges charge subscription
fees for up-to-the-second "real-time" stock quotes.
   The brokers and media companies all distribute stock-price
quotations to their customers, sometimes charging them for
the service. They claim that the exchanges' proposal could
theoretically allow the exchanges to charge fees for
everything from stock tables in newspapers and news stories
about stocks to a broker's advice about stocks.
   Says Ethel E. Daly, a senior vice president at discount
broker Charles Schwab &amp; Co., one of the protesting vendors:
"We feel 15-minute delayed data is in the public domain."
   Mrs. Daly adds that under the exchanges' proposal: "Every
time a quote is used, whether to talk about someone's
holdings or talk about prices, they'd want to be paid for
that."
   Other stock-quote vendors complaining about the exchanges'
proposed changes include Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The
Wall Street Journal; Associated Press; Knight-Ridder Inc.;
Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc.; Reuters Holdings PLC's Instinet
unit; Financial News Network Inc.; and Fidelity Investments.
   The vendors say the dispute is no less than a battle over
who owns stock-market data: the public or the exchanges.
   But in a letter to the SEC, the exchange group led by the
Big Board protests that it merely wants to make "technical
and ministerial" changes to how stock data is distributed.
   The Big Board, as the administrator of the exchanges'
stock-quote feed, has yet to respond specifically to the
vendors' complaints. A Big Board spokeswoman says only that
the exchanges "plan to meet in the next few weeks to review
the comments and draft a response to the SEC."
   A spokesman for the American Stock Exchange says, "The
exchange is sensitive to the vendor community concerns, and
has always endeavored to work with them. This issue will be a
priority item at the next meeting" of the exchanges April 20.
   In Washington, an SEC spokeswoman said the agency is
"analyzing the (vendors') comments carefully." The SEC
declined further comment because the issue is pending.
   So far, the exchanges' explanations haven't swayed the
vendors.
   Fidelity, the big mutual-fund company, protests in a
letter to the SEC that one of the exchanges' goals in its
proposal "is to make it more difficult, and ultimately to
eliminate, our ability to provide delayed market information
to our customers."
   Similarly, Schwab, the discount brokerage firm, claims the
exchanges want to "force the personal-computer user and
others either to pay high charges for real-time market
information, or do without."
   Currently, a typical small investor who uses real-time
quotes through a personal computer has to pay $13 a month for
the right and sign a subscription agreement with the
exchanges, vendors say. Professionals have to pay as much as
$120 a month just for the Big Board feed. That's why most
investors buy delayed stock quotes through the vendors or
simply call their broker.
   Technically, the dispute revolves around the exchanges'
request for the power to redefine at any time what
constitutes a "delayed" stock quote. The vendors fear that
stock quotes traditionally considered "delayed" will suddenly
be ruled "real time" by the exchanges.
   Says a spokesman for Reuters, parent of the Instinet
electronic trading network: "Although the (exchanges')
amendments do not put a great deal of emphasis on the issue
of charges for delayed exchange data, they certainly do leave
the door open in that regard. Reuters is in principle against
any such charges for old data."
   The news services are particularly bothered by the
exchanges' proposition that they have an interest in the
services that derive from stock quotes. They say they fear
the exchanges could someday interfere with news stories that
use stock quotes.
   The issue of market-data rights is a hot one. For example,
in a related dispute with the exchanges, Dow Jones in SEC
filings says it doesn't want to pay real-time fees for the
market data it provides on its quote-intensive Professional
Investor Report news service. The exchanges claim the news
service and its subscribers should pay because they're
utilizing real-time quotes; Dow Jones claims its service is a
newswire and shouldn't be subject to the real-time fees.
   While the Big Board declines to get into the public debate
about the stock-quote issue, it has been busy behind the
scenes. Thomas E. Haley, a top market-data official at the
exchange, has visited vendors and tried to convince them that
the exchanges' changes aren't revolutionary, according to
vendors. The Big Board said Mr. Haley wasn't available to
comment.
