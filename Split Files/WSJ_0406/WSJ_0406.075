   BURBANK, Calif. -- Dawn Steele, who resigned as president
of Columbia Pictures earlier this year, has landed at Walt
Disney Co., which said she will produce movies and television
shows and develop other projects.
   Ms. Steele, in her early 40s, had been rumored for several
months to be leaning toward a relationship with Disney that
might include the establishment of combination day-care and
family-entertainment centers.

   "She wants to do a lot of things in her life; this is a
place where she can fulfill any dreams she has," said David
Hoberman, president of Touchstone Pictures, part of Disney's
Walt Disney Studios unit. There haven't been any discussions
about specific films or other projects, he said.
   Ms. Steel's "exclusive" arrangement with Disney includes
TV production, which she hasn't done before, Mr. Hoberman
said. She left Columbia last fall after the company was
purchased by Sony Corp. Ms. Steele was the second woman after
Sherry Lansing, who oversaw what was then Twentieth
Century-Fox Film Corp.'s movie division, to head a Hollywood
studio.
