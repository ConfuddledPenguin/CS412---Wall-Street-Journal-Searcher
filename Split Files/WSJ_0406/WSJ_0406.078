   New York Have you ever wondered why they called it
badminton instead of goodminton?
   Well so have we, ever since that fateful Saturday a few
weeks back when our local YMCA gym -- a dim, dank and dingy
58-year-old temple to basketball in the heart of Manhattan --
was abruptly seized by apparatchiks from the front office who
declared that henceforth, noon to 2 p.m. on Saturdays was
reserved for the newest full-metal Olympic sport --
badminton.

   Instantly, dozens of basketball-loving men and boys from
New York's mean streets, young men who had taken precious
time off from their hectic careers in substance retailing,
men who looked like substance wholesalers but who are
lawyers, ad guys, delivery bikers, wordsmiths, guitar
players, gofers and the professionally unemployed -- in other
words, God-fearing males gathered into the warm Christian
bonds of basketball fellowship -- were summarily evicted from
the gym.
   Their space confiscated, they wandered the Y in shock.
There were whole floors the B-ballers had never been on, and
they found themselves in mirrored rooms infested with strange
hopper people, who, in their pink-and-lime-green body
stockings, looked like Day-Glo cellulite sausages. Hippity
hop. And rooms full of machines with lots of red lights where
people were doing finger exercises "programming" the
machines.
   Meanwhile, into the now-empty gymnasium strode exactly
three adults and four children armed with those cute little
four-ounce rackets and carrying some strange feathery things
that looked very familiar. At first, we couldn't remember
why.
   Then it hit us: Manuel Noriega's lovenest villa in Panama.
It was all over TV. The brave U.S. Military Invasionary
Forces said they found weird stuff in there: frozen tamales
disguised as cocaine, red panties and feather-and-bone things
used in vile rituals that cannot be discussed in
northern-temperate-zone newspapers.
   But wait a minute. Let's go to the videotape. Those
strange feather-and-bone things weren't what they seemed.
They were . . . yes, badminton shuttlecocks]
   We, of course, don't want to smear badminton by
associating it with despicable dictator-drugsters. We want to
smear badminton fair and square, and that, of course, takes
solid factual information.
   So we looked badminton up. It turns out that some young
British army officers, on home leave from the Indian
subcontinent, decided to play an Indian game called poona at
the Duke of Beaufort's country estate, called Badminton, in
Gloucestershire, Merry Olde England, in 1873. You remember
Poona, the Indian town, of course. It also is the home base
of the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the
give-free-love-and-get-free-Rolls-Royces guy who almost got
Oregon to loosen up in the early '80s.
   We found out something far more interesting, especially to
all you kindhearted animal-rights activists: that real
shuttlecocks are made from real feathers extracted from real
geese. Draw yourself a clear mental picture of how they get
them: Four feathers are plucked from the left wings of four
different geese -- unsedated geese you can bet -- to make a
single shuttlecock. They claim they use only left-wing
feathers so that all shuttlecocks will spin in the same
direction. We do not believe this.
   Our research also revealed that some Americans don't
follow our fairness-to-badminton example. They malign
badminton. We know this because we called up the United
States Badminton Association, headquartered in Papillion,
Neb., and got Ray Scott, who is the retired executive
director but nevertheless was hanging around the office that
day. And he told us: "Its kind of considered to be a wimp
sport," he said. "Our problem is that people in the U.S.
don't understand what it is. But the rest of the world does."
Americans think it's the backyard kiddie game when it's
really a super-fast, high-speed, lightning-moves-type contest
in which shuttlecocks wing off rackets at 200 miles per hour,
he said. Tennis, in contrast, is for super slo-mos.
   We can't argue with him because in the olden days when we
lived in Indonesia, we had the pleasure of watching the Babe
Ruth of Badminton, Rudy Hartono, in action. He was awesome.
In fact, Indonesia is our favorite badminton country. We are
rooting for Indonesia in the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona.
Badminton's muscle, these days, however, is in China.
(Incidentally, Moussy, the no-buzz beer, found that 44% of
this country's sportswriters and broadcasters they surveyed
last year wanted the Olympics to drop badminton even before
the first medals were awarded. Even more wanted to deep-six
synchronized swimming, rhythmic gymnastics and windsurfing
from the games.)
   We think it's wonderful that badminton is big in
California, and sad that the USBA has only about 2,000
card-carrying members compared with two million in England's
association. We feel sorry for Bob Ericson, badminton's
lonely P.R. man, who invited all three TV stations in
Oklahoma City to capture on videotape a major tournament
there recently, and only one showed. Mr. Ericson was hoping
for better exposure this week at the U.S. National
Championships, now shaking the eastern slope of the Rockies
in Colorado Springs (through Saturday). He hasn't gotten it.
Competitors have outnumbered fans. The current national
champion, Tariq Wadood, from California via Pakistan, didn't
show up, although Chris Jogis, former champ, who has
"committed his life to badminton," did says Mr. Ericson, who
envisions big-time, big-bucks badminton for America any
decade now.
   We wish him luck, but we just don't think New York City is
a badminton kind of town, even though, unfortunately, our
research also turned up the fact that America's first
badminton club was started in New York City in 1878. It was
at the 71st Regiment Armory, at 35th and Broadway, and it was
the hot social recreation spot, with all sorts of Astors and
Rockefellers and Vanderbilts popping in.
   Still we wonder how the world would have turned out if
some badminton booster had sidled up to Kareem in the old
days and put a shuttlecock in his hand. A shuttlecock,
incidentally, weighs one-fifth of an ounce, has a cork tip,
and can be substituted one-for-one with chicken heads in
certain vile rituals (See Robert's Rules of Voodoo).
