   INDIANAPOLIS -- Merchants National Corp. said earnings for
the first quarter will be reduced $4 million, or 25 cents a
share, as a result of an increase in nonperforming loans and
a charge related to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The banking concern said loans totaling $45 million in
principal amount are being placed on nonaccrual status. The
loans are all to Midwest borrowers and are mostly related to
real-estate projects.

   Merchants, which hasn't yet released its earnings, also
said it will take a charge of about $3.3 million related to
$5 million of commercial paper issued by Drexel, which filed
for federal bankruptcy-law protection on Feb. 13. The charge
won't affect the allowance for loan losses.
   In the year-ago first quarter, Merchants earned $12.4
million, or 87 cents a share.
