   In an otherwise excellent report, "Bolar Pharmaceutical's
Problems Deepen" (March 2), you state, "So far, the FDA has
forced the recall of Bolar's three major drugs: Dyazide," a
blood-pressure medication; Dilantin, . . . and Macrodantin. .
. ."
   Neither Bolar nor any other generic-drug company has ever
manufactured Dyazide, Dilantin or Macrodantin. All three of
these are brand-name products manufactured by ethical
pharmaceutical companies, and none have been implicated in
the government probe of the generic-drug industry. All
continue to remain on the market today.

   While this may appear to be a small point, for patients
using our products it is not. There is a great deal of
confusion in the public's mind about which drugs have been
recalled and which have not. SmithKline Beecham, makers of
original brandname Dyazide, has been flooded with calls
asking whether our drug is still available. Others have
concerns about our safety and efficacy, both of which have
never been in doubt. The public should know original Dyazide
is still available today and will be available tomorrow.
