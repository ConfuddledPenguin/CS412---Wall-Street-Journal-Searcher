   Durham Corp. turned a cold shoulder to an investor group's
offer to buy the company for $37.50 a share, or an indicated
total of about $315 million.
   Durham, based in Raleigh, N.C., said its lawyers and
financial advisers were reviewing what it called the "highly
speculative" cash-and-debt proposal, made by a group
including Bailey Financial Group Inc., a Rocky Mount, N.C.,
investment concern.

   In a statement, George M. Womble, Durham's chairman and
president, called the proposal "both grossly inadequate and
highly unfavorable to Durham's shareholders." Mr. Womble said
those were his preliminary reactions to the bid, which is
subject to financing, and that he planned to discuss the
proposal with the board.
   Bailey Financial said it could remove the contingencies on
its offer -- and possibly even raise the bid -- once Durham
allows it to review financial and actuarial information. "We
are serious about our offer, and we look forward to a
friendly, negotiated transaction being consummated," Bailey
Financial said.
