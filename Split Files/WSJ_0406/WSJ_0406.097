   Wariness about the Tokyo stock market, the U.S. economy
and the fate of the dollar kept a tight lid on financial
markets.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 1.80
points to 2721.17 in light trading. But the advance was
concentrated in blue-chip issues. Broader market averages
were off slightly. Long-term bond prices eased, and the
dollar was mixed.

   Analysts said worries about Japanese stocks restrained
U.S. stock prices. The Dow industrials lost more than 17
points Wednesday after rumors spread that a big player in the
Japanese stock market was in financial trouble. The Nikkei
index of 225 stocks lost about 1,200 points in early trading
Thursday, but recouped most of that by the end of trading.
   Treasury bonds, which benefited Wednesday from a flight to
safety on the unconfirmed Tokyo rumors, were nearly moribund
yesterday as investors awaited this morning's March
employment report. Economists expect the report to show the
economy generated about 178,000 non-farm jobs last month,
substantially below the growth rate in January and February.
   Currency traders, meantime, awaited the results this
weekend of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations
meeting in Paris, where officials will discuss steps to rein
in the dollar's surge against the Japanese yen. Although
traders don't expect any such efforts to be successful in the
long run, they nevertheless bid the dollar lower against the
yen yesterday.
   Charles Clough, chief portfolio strategist at Merrill
Lynch, said investors are correct to be concerned about the
Tokyo stock market. If nothing else, the disruptions there
could undermine investor confidence in the U.S. market. But
he added that even if Tokyo's troubles spread to the U.S.,
any turmoil is likely to be short-lived. He said U.S.
interest rates are among the lowest in the world, the dollar
is strong and Americans are saving an ever-growing portion of
their incomes -- all signs of fundamental economic strength.
   "Right now, Japan is a loose cannon," he said. "But I
think that if we did see the U.S. markets destabilized, it
wouldn't last long."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices crept higher in light trading. Volume on the
New York Stock Exchange totaled 144.2 million shares. But
declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 744
to 703.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
lost an eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face
amount. The yield on the issue rose to 8.51%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6995 marks, unchanged from
Wednesday, and at 157.4 yen, down from 158.95.
