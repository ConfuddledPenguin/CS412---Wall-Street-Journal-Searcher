   Though he has been hailed by critics as one of Ireland's
major living novelists, and though this year marks the 20th
anniversary of his first book, John Banville has remained
unfamiliar to American readers. Why? Perhaps it's his
penchant for ambiguity and equivocation; or perhaps it's his
devotion to such unsexy subjects as the astronomers
Copernicus and Kepler.
   All this may change, however, with the stateside
publication of "The Book of Evidence" (Scribners, 220 pages,
$17.95). The winner of last year's Booker Prize, Mr.
Banville's beautifully composed and impeccably shaped seventh
novel takes the form of a recit by a 38-year-old scientist
named Frederick Charles St. John Vanderveld (Freddie)
Montgomery, who is being held in an Irish prison for murder.

   Freddie doesn't deny his guilt. But he is eager to tell
the story behind the crime. This he does, shuttling between a
chronicle of recent events and a discontinuous account of his
earlier life: his privileged Irish childhood, his stint on a
California faculty, and -- following his marriage to one
Daphne, whose "moral laziness" strikes in him a responsive
chord -- his abandonment of science and academia for the
indolent life of a Mediterranean gadabout.
   And what a life] For more than a decade, the Montgomerys
drift from one island to another, tarrying at harborside bars
and regarding the world with "grand detachment" and a false
sense of their own inviolability. It is this false sense of
inviolability, in fact, that precipitates Freddie's downfall.
For, simply in order to amuse himself, he blackmails a
small-time drug dealer for a large sum of money. Freddie
spends the money, only to learn afterward that it came from a
local big wheel who expects repayment and is threatening the
lives of his wife and son. Unable to repay, Freddie hies
himself to Ireland to liquidate his late father's art
collection.
   When he arrives at the family manse, however, Freddie
discovers that his mother has sold the collection to Binkie
Behrens, the rich father of his old flame Anna, and has
squandered the money on horses. In desperation, Freddie
steals a 17th-century Dutch portrait (possibly a Rembrandt)
from the Behrens mansion and kills a family maid.
   What makes him commit such a senseless crime? What, for
that matter, makes him live such a senseless life? Freddie
argues that it's not really his fault, for there's no free
will (he acted, he says, "almost without thinking from the
start"), and therefore perhaps there's no such thing as moral
culpability. "There is just the ceaseless, slow, demented
drift of things," he says.
   An equally important factor, though, is Freddie's
self-image. He always has had a sense of himself as "exposed
and invisible . . . (as) something without weight, without
moorings, a floating phantom"; after the murder, he looks
forward to being "unmasked" because only this, he thinks,
will give him "weight, gravity, the sense at last of being
firmly grounded. Then finally I would be me, no longer that
poor impersonation of myself I had been doing all my life. I
would be real. I would be, of all things, human."
   Freddie claims that incarceration provides "time and
leisure really to get to the heart of things." But Mr.
Banville wants us to realize that Freddie never does get to
the heart of things -- that there are matters about which
Freddie (who continually teases us with his power, as
narrator, to revise reality) is deceiving not only us but
himself.
   He is coy, to be specific, about carnal matters. Freddie
inhabits a world of erotic secrets and is surrounded by
ambiguous sexuality. Daphne, we learn, was once involved with
Anna Behrens; Freddie's mother is involved with a stable
girl. And Freddie? In Ireland he haunts a gay bar called
Wally's, and after the murder holes up with a reputed
homosexual; in prison, he expresses a desire for a
"catamite," a wish that seems to be granted by novel's end.
He is always describing men's hands. Yet he claims to find
homosexuality repugnant and insists, "I am not queer."
   Like Ford Madox Ford's "The Good Soldier," then, "The Book
of Evidence" is a cannily constructed novel about sex,
betrayal and self-deception, a novel whose narrator's
testimony is egregiously unreliable and laced with internal
contradictions. Mr. Banville's book also recalls other,
mostly French, novels, among them Andre Gide's "The
Immoralist" (which, like Mr. Banville's book, depicts the
consequences of sexual repression) and Albert Camus's "The
Stranger" (which concerns a senseless murder).
   Yet "The Book of Evidence" does not feel at all
derivative. On the contrary, one comes away from it awed by
the freshness of its descriptions and imagery and by the
vigor and exactness of its diction. Of particular interest is
Mr. Banville's attention to subtleties of light and shadow, a
trait that reminds one less of any other writer than of the
Dutch painters. One could do worse, indeed, than to describe
"The Book of Evidence" as a literary version of a Rembrandt
portrait; for it is, above all, a character study -- dark,
enigmatic and intensely captivating.
