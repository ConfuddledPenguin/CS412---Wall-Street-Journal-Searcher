   CAMDEN, N.J. -- Campbell Soup Co. said it will close its
Chicago warehouse Sept. 28 as part of a consolidation of
distribution facilities in the Midwest.
   Following the facility's closing, the company will
distribute its products to midwestern customers by using
plants in Napoleon, Ohio, and Paris, Texas.
