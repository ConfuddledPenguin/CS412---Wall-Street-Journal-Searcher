   MILFORD, Mass. -- Home National Corp. said regulators may
appoint a receiver for its principal unit, Home National Bank
of Milford. The move is possible because it is "very
doubtful" the unit can raise $8 million to pad its $22.1
million loan loss reserves, as advised by regulators after an
examination of the bank.
   The company warned that failure to raise capital could
cause the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulatory
authorities to "take such action as they consider
appropriate, including the possible appointment of a receiver
for the institution."

   Home National also said it expects to report operating
losses for the first quarter. In the year-ago period, the
bank holding company had a loss of $3 million, or 47 cents a
share.
   The operating losses and the increase in the loan loss
reserves will result in a deficit of shareholder equity of
not less than $6 million, the company said.
   In addition, Home National said it may restate its 1989
year-end results, which were already revised last month to
show a loss of $26.6 million, or $4.18 a share, compared with
profit of $4.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in 1988.
   Home National Corp. had assets of $484.5 million at Dec.
31.
