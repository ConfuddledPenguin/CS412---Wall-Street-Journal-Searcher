   WESTLAKE, Ohio -- Nordson Corp. said conditions that
reduced profit in the first quarter ended Jan. 28 are
continuing in the second quarter.
   William P. Madar, president and chief executive officer,
said weaker demand for Nordson's core products, greater sales
of new products that carry lower profit margins and the
effects of the stronger U.S. dollar continue to affect
earnings.

   Nordson, which produces equipment to apply adhesives and
coatings, declined to make a specific earnings forecast for
the quarter ending this month.
   In the 1990 first quarter, net income fell 17% to $6.7
million, or 70 cents a share, from $8.1 million, or 84 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 19% to $77.5 million
from $65 million.
   For the second quarter of fiscal 1989, Nordson earned $9.7
million, or 99 cents a share, on sales of $73.5 million. More
than half of the company's sales are overseas, but production
is mainly in the U.S.; that makes the company vulnerable when
the value of the dollar rises against foreign currencies. The
dollar has risen sharply against the yen this year, and
Nordson does a sizable business in Japan.
