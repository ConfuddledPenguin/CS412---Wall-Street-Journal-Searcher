   NEW YORK -- The Conference Board, reporting that
help-wanted ad volume continued to fall in February, said
that it may begin to stabilize over the next few months.
   The Help-Wanted Advertising Index, a seasonally adjusted
indicator of hiring plans, fell six points from January's 147
and eight points from 149 in December. The index was 14
points lower than in February 1989.

   Labor demand was measurably lower in February 1990 from a
year ago because of the slower pace of economic activity over
the past 12 months, said Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board
economist. "However, economic growth is not expected to erode
from its present level," he said, "suggesting that recent
declines in help-wanted advertising are unlikely to
accelerate."
   Ad volume, measured in 51 major U.S. newspapers, rose in
three of nine regions. Leading was the West North Central
region with a 6.8% increase. The East South Central and West
South Central regions showed increases of 1.7% and 1.5%,
respectively. Declines ranged from 6.9% in the East North
Central region to 3.9% in the Pacific region.
