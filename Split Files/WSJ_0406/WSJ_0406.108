   The big beverage companies will report mixed first-quarter
earnings, as the nation's thirst for low-calorie drinks
offsets some worries over the impact of price fluctuations.
   Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are expected to report
earnings gains of at least 13%, analysts estimate.
Anheuser-Busch Cos. is seen posting an increase of at least
3.5%. Adolph Coors Co. may report break-even results or post
a profit, compared with a year-earlier loss. Meanwhile,
bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., keeping its dismal
earnings record intact, will probably post another quarterly
decline.

   Analysts are looking for Coca-Cola, which derives the bulk
of its earnings from overseas, to show a 6% rise in
concentrate shipments abroad, while retail sales climb a
strong 10%. In the key Western European market, Coke is
benefiting from its increased involvement in bottling
operations. Volumes will probably be strong in England, for
example, where Coke has a joint-venture bottling business,
and in France, where Coke last year acquired virtually all
the distribution business, says George Thompson, an analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Japan, one of Coke's
biggest markets, should show a solid volume gain at the
retail level.
   Closer to home, Coke's domestic volume is expected to
increase a slim 3% or so, reflecting continued soft sales
among fast-food restaurants, one of the biggest clients for
fountain soft drinks. Amid a lack of any really jazzy
consumer promotions anywhere in the business, Pepsi's volume
should be up only about 3% as well.
   Both companies snapped a several-year discounting spree
late last year and have taken some lumps in recent quarters
as consumers felt some sticker shock. In the first quarter,
though, "moderate price increases didn't cause any unusual
resistance," said Martin Romm, a First Boston Corp. analyst.
The increasing popularity of diet soft drinks, which are
priced the same as regular ones, is tempering consumer
resistance to higher prices, he said. "Diet soft drinks are a
value-added product that provide the consumer a reason to buy
the product," he said.
   In the first quarter, Atlanta-based Coke is expected to
earn between 81 cents and 84 cents a share, according to
analysts' estimates, compared with 72 cents a share a year
earlier.
   Purchase, N.Y.-based Pepsi, aided by stronger fast-food
and snack operations, will earn between 70 cents and 72 cents
a share, up from the year-earlier 62 cents a share. The
results would have been higher except for the earnings
dilution resulting from Pepsi's multibillion-dollar
acquisition binge last year. PaineWebber Inc. estimates that
the dilution sliced about 11 cents a share off Pepsi's
earnings in the latest quarter.
   Earnings at Coca-Cola Enterprises are expected to fall to
between two cents and five cents a share from the year-ago
seven cents. One optimistic analyst sees flat earnings.
Higher marketing costs again appear to be the main culprit,
analysts said. The giant Coca-Cola bottler, whose recent
profit performance has disappointed investors, has been
increasing marketing and promotional spending to lessen
consumer resistance to higher soft-drink prices.
   But low pricing, which has been squeezing soft-drink
bottlers' margins until recently, has been creeping up. That
trend has led some analysts to predict higher earnings for
Coca-Cola Enterprises in 1990, although the comparative 1989
earnings were poor.
   Amid a moderate 2.5% to 3% increase in beer shipments in
the first quarter, Anheuser-Busch, St. Louis, is expected to
earn between 60 and 64 cents a share, compared with 58 cents
a year earlier. Although the major brewers raised prices 3%
early this year, some uncertainty remains about the effect on
profits of sporadic and regional price discounting in the
beer business. But, said Mr. Romm of First Boston, "the beer
industry seems to be very healthy in the first quarter. All
points of reference suggest that the consumer is drinking
more light and premium light beers."
   Coors, of Golden, Colo., is expected to have at least a
break-even quarter, compared with a loss of 13 cents a share.
Analysts credit the company's Keystone beer brand, introduced
last September. The so-called popular-price beer, Keystone
has been selling well above expectations because of a strong
marketing campaign and the flagging fortunes of some smaller
competitors.
