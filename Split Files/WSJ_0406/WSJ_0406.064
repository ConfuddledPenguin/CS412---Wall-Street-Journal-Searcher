   TOKYO -- Sales of imported cars and commercial vehicles in
Japan soared 42% to 203,010 vehicles, topping the
200,000-unit level for the first time, the Japan Automobile
Importers' Association said.
   The total, which compares with 142,495 units last year,
marks the fourth year sales have set a record, the
association said.

   Import-vehicle sales jumped 60% to 25,943 units in March
alone from 16,169 units a year earlier, the association said.
   The record number of sales for one month marks the 75th
consecutive month in which imported auto sales rose from
year-earlier levels, the association said.
   Although West German vehicle makers led the import sales,
U.S. car makers sold 2,554 units in March, up 41% from 1,812
units in the year-earlier period.
