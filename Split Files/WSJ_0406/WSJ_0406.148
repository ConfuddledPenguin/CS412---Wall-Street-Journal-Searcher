   Trendex Capital Management Corp., representing a dissident
group of Lionel Corp. shareholders, increased pressure on the
toy retailer to find a buyer.
   The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based group represents 5% of
Lionel's 13.5 million shares outstanding. It requested that
New York-based Lionel remove any impediments to would-be
acquirers, including cancellation of a standstill agreement
with former suitor Robert I. Toussie, of New York. The group,
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also
asked Lionel to empanel an independent committee to examine
Lionel's relationship with Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard
Marden.

   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lionel closed at $4.25, unchanged.
   Lionel officials couldn't be reached for comment. Nor
could Messrs. Perlmutter and Marden be reached.
   James DeBolt, of Trendex, said the group has no intention
of launching its own takeover bid for Lionel but will do
whatever is necessary to maximize shareholder value.
