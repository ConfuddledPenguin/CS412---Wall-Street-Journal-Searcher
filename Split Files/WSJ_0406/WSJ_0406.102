   Several of the nation's big retailers reported weak sales
for March, reflecting this year's later Easter holiday season
and continued sluggish demand for some durable goods.
   Analysts estimate sales at stores open at least a year
rose an average of less than 3% from a year earlier, or less
than the inflation rate. The figures are sketchier than usual
because a number of large chains with different fiscal
calendars won't report March sales until next week. They
include K mart Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp., May Department
Stores Inc. and Limited Inc.

   "The weak hard-goods sales reflect a somewhat flat
consumer economy across the country," maintained Thomas
Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   He predicted a stronger showing next week when department
stores and specialty stores that rely more heavily on
clothing sales report their results. "The early warm weather
really helped," he said. "Business for apparel retailers is
coming in better than management planned."
   With Easter's shift into April this year from late March,
some analysts favor combining the two months for comparison
purposes. "When all is said and done, you're going to see a
same-store increase averaging 6%," predicted Robert Buchanan
of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   After adjusting for inflation, which he believes is
increasing at a rate of around 4% or 5%, Mr. Buchanan
predicted little growth in sales. "Consumer spending is still
slow," he said. "Disposable income growth has slowed. People
seem determined to save at least part of their income."
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's largest retailer,
posted a 1.6% gain in U.S. same-store sales, after excluding
discontinued items from its year-earlier results. A Sears
spokesman, however, said executives were "very pleased" with
the showing because last year's figures were inflated by an
advertising blitz that accompanied the launch of Sears's
everyday low-price policy.
   Woolworth Corp. said its U.S. same-store sales dropped
3.7%. Same-store sales at Ames Department Stores Inc. fell
13.5%. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. said same-store sales rose 1%
and Melville Corp. said its sales rose 2.8%.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. reported the
strongest showings. Same-store sales at Wal-Mart, the
fast-growing discounter that has been gaining market share,
rose 12%. Penney rang up an 8.7% increase in same-store
sales, partly because it compensated for the later Easter by
moving up its 25% discount promotion for credit card
customers to March from April last year.
