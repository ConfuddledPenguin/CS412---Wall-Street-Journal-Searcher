   NEW YORK -- Investors remained wary of making commitments
in the over-the-counter market, allowing prices to sink in
yesterday's session.
   Traders say there was evident relief that losses on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange were moderate overnight. Jitters over a
further breakdown in that market depressed OTC share prices
Wednesday.

   But relief failed to turn to conviction, and unlisted
share prices fell to narrow losses yesterday as
computer-driven program trading knocked the New York Stock
Exchange off its highs for the day.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index ended with a 0.46% loss, down 2
to 433.42. On the Big Board, the composite index slipped less
than 0.1%.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 939 to 982. Total Nasdaq
volume was 134.2 million shares, down slightly from 138.4
million shares on Wednesday. National Market System volume
totaled 102,057,100 shares, up slightly from Wednesday's
100,882,000 shares.
   Following their recent trend, over-the-counter financial
stocks underperformed other sectors of the market. The Nasdaq
Financial 100 Index, which includes the largest OTC bank,
thrift and insurance issues, fell 4.84, or 1.24%, to 384.53.
   The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes many of the market's
big technology stocks, fell only half as much, losing 2.84,
or 0.66%, to 428.12.
   Nelson Gold, senior vice president of OTC trading at
Interstate-Johnson Lane in Atlanta, says over-the-counter
traders remain gun-shy of the market.
   "Everybody's very relieved that Japan hasn't closed down
for repairs, but everyone is very wary."
   But Christine Callies, senior technical analyst at Cowen &amp;
Co., doubts that Tokyo will continue to be much of a threat
to unlisted share prices here.
   "I think the market can be spooked only so many times by
fear of the same things," she says. "I don't think that Tokyo
alone has the ability to damage our market beyond a
short-term time frame."
   Nor does Ms. Callies worry about further evidence of
declining corporate profits to send the overall market much
lower.
   Many market watchers are concerned that the coming
reporting period for first-quarter earnings will be rife with
disappointments.
   While disappointments are sure to topple some stock
prices, Ms. Callies believes that the environment for
equities has been improving since stock prices hit their
lateJanuary lows.
   "On down days there's a noticeable reluctance for the
market to fall," she says. And while recent rallies have
tended to be timid, she adds that the pattern is typical of a
"consolidation" when the market digests earlier gains.
   Ms. Callies says that, over the next couple of months, she
doesn't expect the OTC market to fall further than the 420
level on the Nasdaq Composite Index. But the market could
carry the index as high as 445, she adds.
   Laidlaw Transportation class B shares led the OTC
most-active list, down 1 to 20 1/8 on volume of more than 5.7
million shares.
   Late Wednesday, the company reported that its second
quarter net income rose to $60.3 million from the $42 million
earned in the year-earlier period.
   The transportation and waste-treatment company also
reported that it would sell its Byers Transport unit for an
undisclosed amount.
   ADAC Laboratories was also high on the most-active list,
down 5/8 to 1 1/8 on volume of more than 3.7 million shares.
The company said it expects to report revenue and earnings in
its second quarter ended April 1 substantially lower than
those reported for a year ago. The company said it about
broke even in the second quarter.
   Pharmacy Management Services closed at 15 nec on volume of
nearly 2 million shares. The company's 2.5-million share
initial public offering was priced late Wednesday at $12 a
share.
   Enclean added 1/2 to 10. A 2.35-million share secondary
offering of the company's stock was sold at $9 a share.
   International Dairy Queen lost the 3-point gain registered
Wednesday, falling 3 1/2 to 57 1/4 yesterday. An advertising
campaign for the company's new frozen yogurt product has
drawn attention to the stock.
   For those investors who were brave enough to buy the
American Depository Receipts of Japanese companies Wednesday,
yesterday was a cheery day. The ADRs dropped in Wednesday's
session in anticipation of a sharp sell-off in Tokyo -- which
failed to occur.
   NEC gained 4 1/4 to 70 5/8, Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance
added 4 to 45 1/2, and Canon rose 3 1/8 to 58.
   Software Toolworks remained unchanged at 15 on volume of
more than 1.1 million shares. The company paid a 100% stock
dividend Wednesday to shareholders of record March 26.
