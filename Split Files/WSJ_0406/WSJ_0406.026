   WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in
another move aimed at curbing trading abuses, proposed a rule
that would order members of brokers' groups to register with
commodities exchanges.
   The groups, known as broker associations, have come under
heightened scrutiny in the wake of last year's federal
undercover investigation of fraud in the Chicago futures
pits. An earlier CFTC study found that relationships among
members of broker associations may increase the potential for
trading abuses.

   The proposed rules would require broker associations to
register with futures exchanges and would direct exchanges to
set up monitoring programs for the groups. The rules would
apply to any group in which brokers work together to execute
customer orders and share profits and losses from customer
trades.
   The commission will take public comments on the proposal
for 60 days before making a decision on final rules.
