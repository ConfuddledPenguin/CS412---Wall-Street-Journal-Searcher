   Southwestern banks continued their modest recovery in the
first quarter, bolstered as much as anything by the fact that
they aren't Northeastern banks.
   "You've got shifting fortunes between those two areas,"
said James McDermott Jr., an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods Inc. "In the Southwestern areas there is a sense of
stability and gradual improvement in operating conditions,
whereas in the Northeast there continues to be
deterioration."

   Indeed, compared with some New England banks, which have
taken massive charges against shaky real-estate loans in
recent months, Southwestern banks are beginning to look
almost solid.
   First City Bancorp of Texas, a Houston bank holding
company recapitalized with nearly $1 billion in federal
assistance two years ago, said it expects to report its
seventh consecutive quarterly increase in net income. A
spokesman said the company plans to report that first-quarter
net was $3.70 a share, fully diluted -- including an
as-yet-unspecified gain from the sale of its credit-card
subsidiary -- up from net of $1 a share in the year-earlier
period. The spokesman said the results reflect the company's
decision to "take some additional reserves to build back our
balance sheet," and are in line with its plan for the year.
   While such results mostly reflect the clean balance sheet
First City received in the recapitalization, they also
suggest improvements in the Texas economy. Frank Cihak, First
City vice chairman, took a call recently from an East Coast
stock analyst who inquired whether the bank had any
real-estate loans in the Northeast. Mr. Cihak replied that
the bank's real-estate loans are concentrated in Texas.
"That's great," the analyst replied, according to a First
City spokesman.
   Don Powell, chief executive of First Amarillo Bancorp,
Amarillo, Texas, agrees that "the economic engine we need in
Texas is beginning to move, but it's slow." Citing a decrease
in nonperforming loans and slightly better interest margins,
Mr. Powell said he expects first-quarter operating profit to
be about "a half million bucks," or 17.5 cents a share, up
sharply from the year-earlier operating profit of $84,782, or
three cents a share. "I believe we've most definitely
stabilized," he said.
   Terry Kelley, president of Fort Worth, Texas-based Team
Bank, said improvements in the residential real-estate market
and energy-related industries have fueled loan demand. "We're
beginning to see some loan growth across the state," said Mr.
Kelley, whose bank was created, with nearly $1 billion of
federal help, primarily from the failed banks of Texas
American Bancshares Inc., Fort Worth. "There's more cautious
optimism in the energy industry than there's been in the last
several years," he added.
   In New Mexico, meanwhile, "real estate is relatively soft,
but it isn't in the tank," said Carl Guist, chief financial
officer of United New Mexico Financial Corp. Although "we
don't see a lot of booming expansion here this year," Mr.
Guist said, he expects first-quarter earnings to be "slightly
better" than the $1.3 million, or 30 cents a share, reported
in the year-ago period.
   Even in Arizona, which has been ravaged in recent months
by a real-estate collapse, some analysts see light at the end
of the tunnel. Thomas Brown, an analyst with PaineWebber
Inc., expects Valley National Corp. to report a first-quarter
profit, after three consecutive quarters of heavy losses
linked primarily to the Phoenix bank holding company's
real-estate loans. Mr. Brown said he expects nonperforming
loan growth to flatten out at the company. "I think we'll
look back on {the fourth and first quarters} as an important
turning point."
   However, not all analysts are as sanguine about Valley's
prospects for the quarter. Robert Rieke, an analyst with
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, is predicting a loss of
22 cents a share in the period, against net of 96 cents a
year earlier. Valley National declined to comment.
   Colorado banks also are expected to report a few bumps
along the road to recovery. "The first quarter isn't
necessarily going to be a barn-burner from our viewpoint,"
said James L. Basey, executive vice president of Colorado
National Bankshares Inc., Denver.
   Boettcher &amp; Co., Denver, said it lowered its first-quarter
and 1990 estimates for Colorado National by 20 cents a share
"to reflect the negative effects of a large credit which will
likely show up as a new non-performing asset." Mr. Basey
wouldn't comment specifically on the first quarter, but
acknowledged: "We're still somewhat choked on a high level of
real-estate problems," particularly in the Colorado Springs
area.
   Perhaps the biggest bump for the quarter came from
Hibernia Corp., whose 64-quarter streak of profit increases
ended after regulators examined the bank's real-estate loans.
The New Orleans bank holding company, which had seemingly
weathered the region's economic downturn in better shape than
any of its competitors, said it doubled its loan-loss reserve
to $110 million, resulting in an expected first-quarter net
loss of $25 million, or about 90 cents a share.
   Hibernia also said it is adding $64 million in loans to
nonperforming status -- half at regulators' request and half
to reflect "uncertainty in the economy and uncertainty about
what examiners may require banks to do in the future."
