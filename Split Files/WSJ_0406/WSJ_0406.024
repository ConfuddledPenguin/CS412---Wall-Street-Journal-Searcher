   TOKYO -- The need for Bank of Japan to raise interest
rates could increase if the meeting by the Group of Seven
industrialized nations this weekend offers little help in
supporting the yen, analysts say.
   They say Japan can expect little succor from the U.S. and
other major partners. So Bank of Japan may have to gradually
start tightening in the money market as a prelude to boosting
the official discount rate for the fifth time in a row since
last May.

   That may be harder this time around as interest rates are
now at the level where further increases could seriously hurt
the economy, some analysts caution. Bank of Japan's
tightening this past year has only reversed the easing over
the previous few years.
   What Japan needs from the G-7 meeting in Paris among
Japan, the U.S., West Germany, U.K., France, Italy and Canada
is some coordinated interest rate action with the U.S.,where
the Federal Reserve eased rates as Bank of Japan raised them.
This would repay the easing that Japan pursued for several
years after the Plaza Accord 1985 to support the dollar. The
accord was the first agreement by the G-7 for coordinated
attempts to keep the dollar within certain ranges.
   But "what they'll get is probably little but warm words
about coordinated policy," says David Pike, chief economist
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International Ltd. As a result, there
will be "a shift of focus back onto the Bank of Japan and a
fifth hike in the ODR {official discount rate}."
   The Japanese believe that now "it is time for the U.S. to
play its international role and help us out of our trouble,"
Mr. Pike says. "They helped the Americans . . . with a
relatively lax monetary policy. Now they are counting the
costs."
   But the U.S. hasn't shown much willingness to help.
   "Domestic considerations will continue to dictate U.S.
{monetary} policy," which is concerned more about inflation
than the yen, Mr. Pike says.
   "Unless the U.S. eases monetary policy, we can't expect
much appreciation in the Japanese yen," says Susumu Kato,
senior economist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp. But he said
he doesn't expect any immediate policy change by the Fed.
   "To stabilize foreign exchange, Japan doesn't want to have
to raise interest rates but instead wants other countries to
lower their interest rates," says Takashi Tsuchiya, economist
at Tokai Bank. "But the U.S. probably won't lower interest
rates, and West Germany probably won't either. If this
happens, then the yen will weaken further."
   Mr. Kato of Goldman Sachs says it is likely that the yen
will be traded around 155 to the dollar even after the G-7
meeting. The dollar was trading in New York at around 157.45
yen Thursday, down from 158.95 yen in New York late
Wednesday.
   However, the Tokyo stock market's prolonged decline and
the slowing of the economy may make Bank of Japan even more
wary of acting suddenly and severely than in the past, some
analysts say.
   Any tightening is likely to be gradual and well advertised
to avoid spooking the Japanese financial markets further, the
analysts contend. "It is very difficult to expect any
monetary policy change given the very fragile financial
markets," says Mr. Kato.
   "The BOJ is going to be fairly reluctant and the Ministry
of Finance will be out-and-out against" boosting the discount
rate again, says Mr. Pike of UBS. So "it is likely to be
fairly well sign-posted."
   Yet market participants contend that, by delaying a boost
in March, the ministry's reluctance prevented any impact on
the dollar's upward momentum and further eroded Bank of
Japan's credibility. With Japanese interest rates starting to
attract the interest of investors in the yen, their
confidence that Bank of Japan has the freedom to do what is
needed to defend the currency and fight inflation is more
crucial than ever.
   Bank of Japan has to make definite moves that reassure
investors, says Mr. Pike of UBS. But if the central bank does
want to take the public step of raising the discount rate
again, he says, "we will get the usual bickering" with the
Finance Ministry.
   Expecting a boost of 0.75 to one percentage point in June
or July, Takahide Furuhashi, head of research at DB Capital
Markets Asia Ltd., says the way it is carried out will
determine its impact. "If they are forced to raise the ODR
hike like the one we had before, it will have no effect at
all," Mr. Furuhashi says.
