   Most computer software companies' earnings improved in the
first quarter, analysts say, although profit forecasts are
sometimes risky, as Oracle Systems Corp. reminded holders
last week.
   Fast-growing Oracle shocked the market March 27 by
reporting flat earnings for its third quarter ended Feb. 28.
The next day, its stock fell $7.875 to $17.50 on record
over-the-counter volume of 21 million shares.

   Analysts say that barring such surprises, the outlook for
most of the closely watched software companies is upbeat,
with personal-computer software providing the headiest
growth.
   For its third quarter ended March 31, bellwether Microsoft
Corp. should report a 60% profit increase to $69 million, or
$1.15 to $1.20 a share, from $41.1 million, or 73 cents a
share, says Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co. Revenue was up more than 50% to about $300 million from
$197 million, he adds. "It will be a real strong quarter," he
says. He predicted sharper growth in the fourth quarter
because of the introduction of four products.
   Robert Therrien of PaineWebber sees even stronger
Microsoft earnings, of $1.25 to $1.30 a share. However, he
worries that at some point Microsoft will be hurt by a
lawsuit by Apple Computer Inc. that charges copyright
infringement of the Macintosh computer by Microsoft's Windows
program. "I'm not recommending the stock for that reason," he
says.
   Lotus Development Corp., the No. 2 PC software company,
will "look very strong, coming off a depressed earnings
comparison," says David Readerman of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
He estimates net income more than tripled to about 48 cents a
share from $5.3 million, or 13 cents a share. Revenue rose
about 29% to $155 million from $120 million.
   This year Lotus continues to benefit from its big base of
existing customers who are upgrading to improved versions of
its 1-2-3 software that were introduced last summer. In
addition, it has been bringing out versions of 1-2-3 for
larger computers such as International Business Machines
Corp. mainframes and Sun Microsystems Inc. workstations.
   Analysts say that Lotus should report good growth in the
current quarter compared to depressed 1989 levels but that
the comparisons will be more difficult in the second half.
   Among smaller PC software companies, analysts expect
Ashton-Tate Corp. to report a small loss compared with the
year-ago first quarter, when net income was $11.1 million, or
43 cents a share. Ashton-Tate has reported losses since then
because of slumping sales as users wait for it to produce an
error-free update of its dBase software program. Mr. Sherlund
estimates first-quarter sales fell 33% to about $60 million
from $89.8 million.
   Software Publishing Corp. and Borland International Inc.
are both growing about 25% in sales and earnings, Mr.
Sherlund adds.
   In the mainframe software arena, Computer Associates Inc.,
the biggest company in the industry, faces slow growth but
rising profit. Computer Associates acquired unprofitable
Cullinet Software in the third quarter last year, and while
losses have been stanched, sales of Cullinet's products have
continued to decline.
   Mr. Readerman predicts that for its fourth quarter ended
March 31, Computer Associates will report net of about 36
cents a share, compared with 23 cents a share, or $42.5
million restated, the year before. He estimates revenue was
about the same as last year's restated $357.9 million.
   The big computer-services companies are growing steadily
because "the most interesting thing in the industry is
outsourcing," says Mr. Therrien of PaineWebber. Corporate
computer users increasingly are willing to entrust some of
their data processing and management of their computers to
outside firms. As a result, he says, General Motors Corp.'s
Electronic Data Systems, Computer Sciences Corp. and
Automatic Data Processing Inc. will all be up 10% to 15% in
earnings. "They're good, solid, predictable companies," he
says.
