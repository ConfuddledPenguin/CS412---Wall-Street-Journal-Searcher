   I find it incredible that your television critic Martha
Bayles would call Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the
Sea" a "pretentious, mediocre novella" (Leisure &amp; Arts, March
15). I would like to remind her that Hemingway won the Nobel
Prize for literature for this work in 1954. Ms. Bayles's
judgment undoubtedly has been altered by watching too much
TV. I suggest that in the future she forgo literary criticism
and stick to reviewing such masterpieces as "The Gong Show."

   "The Old Man and the Sea" re-established Hemingway as one
of the significant writers of the 20th century. Even
Hemingway's most virulent literary critics would hesitate to
describe "The Old Man" in such negative terms.
   Ms. Bayles, who must spend much of her working life
watching television, has obviously had her tastes jaded by
that most pretentious, mediocre media.
   As a bookseller, I am pleased that she is not a book
reviewer and hope she continues to work in a field to which
she is so nicely suited.
