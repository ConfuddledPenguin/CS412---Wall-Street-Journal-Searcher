   The federal government agreed to accept $3 million in
forfeitures from defendants in the Princeton/Newport Limited
Partnership racketeering case -- much less than the
government originally sought but more than a federal judge
ordered.
   The agreement was revealed in a proposed order submitted
to U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter in New York City last
week. The forfeitures will have to be paid only if the
convictions of the six defendants in the case are upheld on
appeal.

   The potent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
law, or RICO, requires convicted defendants to forfeit their
profits from alleged wrongdoing, plus interest, as well as
their salaries during the period of wrongdoing and their
stake in what the law calls a "racketeering enterprise."
   Last July, a federal jury returned guilty verdicts against
five officials of Princeton/Newport and a former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. trader on multiple felony counts
relating to securities fraud, conspiracy and racketeering.
The jury determined that the defendants should forfeit assets
totaling $3.8 million, far less than the $21.7 million the
government sought. At the time, the government vowed it would
appeal the forfeiture verdict because it was too low.
   But when he sentenced the defendants in November, Judge
Carter ordered a total of $1.6 million in forfeitures from
two of the six defendants. He dismissed the forfeitures
sought by the government against most of the defendants
because, he said, "the benefits the defendants received were
greatly disproportionate to the penalty," in violation of the
Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
   Since the Princeton/Newport defendants were convicted, the
Justice Department has issued new guidelines urging
prosecutors not to seek disproportionate penalties or to
bring RICO charges in a case involving mostly tax offenses.
In the Princeton/Newport case, most of the offenses were
tax-related.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Cartucsciello said the
settlement didn't indicate any weakening of the government's
position. "The settlement is a settlement, not an admission,"
he said, adding, "The defendants originally said they should
pay nothing." The government also agreed to remove prior
restraining orders on the defendants' assets soon.
   But Jack Arseneault, a defense lawyer in the case,
disagreed. "This is not only less than the government asked
for, but less than the jury awarded," he said. While Mr.
Arseneault acknowledged that lawyers argued that defendants
shouldn't have to pay anything, he said, "We compromised more
out of practicality than out of an admission that any
forfeiture is appropriate." Mr. Arseneault said the
defendants agreed to the compromise because many had
difficulty living with restraints on their assets.
   Under the agreement, James Sutton Regan, the former
managing partner of Princeton/Newport, will forfeit
$2,367,645 if his conviction is upheld on appeal. Former
Princeton/Newport general partners Jack Z. Rabinowitz,
Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman will forfeit $157,843
each. Steven B. Smotrich, the defunct securities firm's
former comptroller, will forfeit $983, and Bruce L. Newberg,
a former Drexel trader who did business with
Princeton/Newport will forfeit $157,843.

   LIBEL SUIT against Glamour Magazine may be allowed to
proceed.
   Eric A. Foretich, former husband of Elizabeth Morgan, sued
Glamour and others, alleging that a Glamour article left the
impression that he had sexually abused their daughter Hilary,
as Dr. Morgan claims.
   Conde Nast Publications Inc., which publishes Glamour,
author Bob Trebilcock and others at the company also are
defendants in the suit, in which Dr. Foretich and his parents
seek $40 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in
punitive damages. Conde Nast is part of the Newhouse
publishing empire.
   In a decision this week, U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell of Washington, D.C., said Dr. Foretich's libel suit
was barred because it was filed more than one year after
publication of the November 1988 article. But Judge Gesell
said Dr. Foretich can proceed with the suit if he can show
that the magazine gave permission to supporters of Dr. Morgan
to copy and distribute the article, as Dr. Foretich contends.
Under libel law, subsequent re-publications of the same
material are considered new publications.
   Dr. Morgan became the center of widespread media attention
when she spent 25 months in jail for civil contempt after
refusing to produce Hilary for a two-week unsupervised visit
with her ex-husband.
   Dr. Morgan has claimed that Dr. Foretich sexually abused
Hilary, a charge he denies. A judge said the evidence was
inconclusive about whether abuse had occurred.

   WESTERN UNION LOSES challenge to gay-discrimination law.
   California Superior Court Judge Ira Brown rejected the
company's efforts to declare the 13-year-old San Francisco
ordinance, the first of its kind in the nation, invalid under
California's constitution. Judge Brown also rejected Western
Union's claim that cities don't have the power to give
victims the right to sue for damages over wrongful conduct,
such as job discrimination.
   Western Union asked the judge to declare the law invalid
after the company was sued by Armand Ertag, a former employee
who claimed he was harassed on the job by a supervisor.
Melvin Honowitz, Mr. Ertag's lawyer, said the decision clears
the way for the case to be addressed on its merits. Mr. Ertag
is suing for damages for lost compensation, emotional
distress and invasion of privacy.
   A Western Union spokesman said the Upper Saddle River,
N.J., company had planned to withdraw its challenge to the
ordinance this week before it learned of the judge's
decision.
   "What we had here was really a narrow legal issue, which
we offered as a defense," the spokesman said. The legal
tactic, however, created "a widespread reaction that the
company discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation.
That is absolutely not the case," he said.
   Western Union's actions in the case spurred a boycott by
some gay-rights organizations. The Human Rights Campaign Fund
in Washington, D.C., for instance, canceled a contract that
it estimated would have given the company $350,000 in revenue
this year. A group of gay and lesbian San Francisco city
employees plans to file a complaint with the city's Human
Rights Commission asking that the city government be
prohibited from doing business with the ailing communications
company.

   DIGGES SENTENCED: Edward S. Digges Jr., the
product-liability defense specialist who pleaded guilty in
January to stealing more than $2 million from a former
client, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison. The scion of
one of Maryland's most wealthy and prominent legal families,
Mr. Digges, 44 years old, faced as much as three years in
jail for padding legal bills and submitting phony invoices.
Mr. Digges apologized for the theft, saying he is only now
beginning to understand his behavior. A psychiatrist
testified that Mr. Digges suffers from a "narcissistic
personality disorder" that made him unable to comprehend the
magnitude of his crime. U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove
in Baltimore sentenced Mr. Digges to probation for three
years upon his release and ordered him to pay $1 million in
restitution and $30,000 in fines. Mr. Digges is to report to
prison May 7.

   JUDICATE, the nation's oldest private court system, hired
Stephen D. Edenbaum, a former IBM sales executive, to head
its national sales division. The move is another step in
Judicate's efforts to shift from advertising and promoting
its private-mediation service to direct sales through phone
calls and presentations. Lackluster performance since
Judicate introduced its private alternative
dispute-resolution service in 1983 forced the company to lay
off marketing staff and impose across the board salary cuts
in August. The company has yet to turn a profit, but new
emphasis on sales, said Theodore A. Schwartz, Judicate's head
of investor relations, is already paying off.
