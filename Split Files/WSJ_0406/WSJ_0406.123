   Swedish telecommunications group AB L.M. Ericsson said it
signed a 1.1 billion-krona ($179 million) contract with the
Mexican Telephone Administration for the delivery of AXE
digital switching systems and power equipment in 1991.
   Ericsson said a further contract for the delivery of
transmission equipment is expected to be signed shortly.

   The group said the order is part of a five-year general
agreement recently signed between Ericsson and Mexican
Telephone with a total value of six billion kronor.
   Further orders are also expected for power and
transmission equipment as well as for other specific projects
over the five-year period, Ericsson said.
   It said the order was a result of the Mexican government's
determination to expand the country's telecommunications
system.
