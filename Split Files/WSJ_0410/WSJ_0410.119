   HOUSTON -- A longtime Texas oil company, Huffington Corp.,
agreed to be acquired by Taiwan's national oil company.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but an industry official familiar
with Huffington's assets valued them at $700 million to $900
million. Huffington's primary asset is a 20% interest in an
Indonesian joint venture, which supplies natural gas to one
of the world's largest liquefied-natural-gas facilities.

   Chinese Petroleum Corp., the Taiwan oil company, said it
recently began receiving liquified-natural gas, or LNG, from
the facility. The company said that under a sales accord with
Indonesia's state oil company, Pertamina, it imports 1.5
million tons a year of LNG from that country.
   Roy M. Huffington, founder of Huffington about 30 years
ago, said in a statement that "this acquisition represents a
very promising strategic opportunity" for Chinese Petroleum.
   It is believed that a group from Japan, another a big
importer of LNG, was interested in acquiring Huffington. The
company put itself up for sale in November.
   In addition to the energy assets, Huffington owns about 11
blocks in downtown Houston and 419 acres of undeveloped
Houston real estate. Huffington sold its domestic oil and gas
reserves in August 1988 to France's Elf Aquitaine.
