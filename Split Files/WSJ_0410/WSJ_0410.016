   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling
about 101,000 of its 1986-model Aerostar minivans to repair a
defect that could cause fuel leaks.
   The auto maker said it isn't aware of any fires or
accidents linked to the defect. Ford said it will install,
free of charge, new seals between the gas tanks and the gas
tank filler pipes.
