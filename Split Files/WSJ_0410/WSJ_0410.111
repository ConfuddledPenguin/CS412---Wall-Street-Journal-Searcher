   The company said nonperforming loans and other real estate
owned totaled about $246 million, up from $156 million at
year end. Other loans 90 days or more past due were $100
million at March 31, down $14 million from Dec. 31. It said
reserves at March 31 equaled 52% of nonperforming loans and
other real estate owned.
   Separately, BayBanks said a holder has filed a lawsuit
against the company, its directors and certain officers in
federal court in Boston, charging that the company made
misleading disclosures in past public statements and reports.
Chairman William M. Crozier Jr. said "BayBanks believes that
it has reported its affairs properly and will vigorously
defend against this complaint.
   In national over-the-counter trading, BayBanks closed at
$15.25, up $1.375.
