   DALLAS -- Southwest Airlines said it flew 861.6 million
revenue passenger miles, up 6% from March last year. A
revenue passenger mile is the equivalent of flying one paying
passenger one mile. The carrier's March load factor, or the
percentage of seats filled by paying passengers, decreased to
64.4%, from 68.7% a year ago.
   For the first quarter, Southwest flew 2.3 billion revenue
passenger miles, up 5.1% from the same 1989 period. Its
first-quarter load factor was 60.4%, off from 65.3% a year
earlier.
