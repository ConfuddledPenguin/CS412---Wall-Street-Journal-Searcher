   Eastman Kodak Co.'s highly touted Ultralife lithium
battery, which was supposed to last 10 years on the shelf,
lasted only four years.
   Kodak said it would stop production by June 30 of the
nine-volt lithium battery, which was introduced amid much
fanfare in 1986 but has been plagued with problems. Despite
the move, the photographic, chemical and pharmaceutical
concern still maintains that its lithium battery is a
technological breakthrough.

   Kodak is continuing to market its line of Supralife
alkaline batteries, but some analysts believe Kodak will
ultimately get out of the highly competitive consumer battery
business altogether because it hasn't been that profitable.
   The Ultralife battery never caught on with consumers,
partly because its nine-volt size restricted its use; it
represents less than 1% of Kodak's battery sales. In
addition, Kodak had difficulty breaking into a market
dominated by such strong brand names as Duracell and
Eveready.
   "The investment necessary to grow the {Ultralife} market
just wasn't consistent with our financial objectives," said a
spokesman at Kodak, which is in the midst of a cost-cutting
program.
   When Kodak entered the consumer battery business four
years ago, it bragged that its Ultralife lithium battery had
a 10-year shelf life and would last twice as long as its
alkaline counterparts. Ultralife was to be the flagship
battery in a line that also included Japanese-made alkaline
batteries sold under Kodak's Supralife brand.
   Ultralife was the industry's first mass-market lithium
cell, setting Kodak apart from other battery makers.
Previously, longer-lasting lithium batteries had been largely
limited to cameras and hearing aids; lithium hadn't gained
wide acceptance because it's highly combustible. Kodak
overcame that problem by patenting a safety mechanism that
would shut down the cell if it short-circuited.
   But Ultralife, which is mostly used in home smoke
detectors and garage door openers, failed to spark the
battery market. Introduction was delayed until 1987 because
of production problems. Then in 1988, Black &amp; Decker Corp.
pulled thousands of flashlights off store shelves and stopped
shipment on the new line of smoke detectors that carried the
Ultralife after Kodak discovered an unexpected buildup of
material that affected its shelf life. Kodak remedied the
problem quickly, but the snafu hurt the credibility of Kodak,
which is based in Rochester, N.Y.
   Furthermore, there isn't a big demand for the nine-volt
size, which accounts for less than 10% of unit volume and 15%
of U.S. dollar sales of batteries.
   In fact, Duracell decided against making a nine-volt
lithium battery. "We considered it, but you don't need 10
years in such low-drain applications," like smoke detectors,
contends Charles Perrin, president of Duracell North America.
"It doesn't provide a real value to consumers." Duracell,
which was acquired in a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., is the world's largest maker of lithium
batteries.
   Kodak said it will maintain its Ultra Technologies plant
in Newark, N.Y., to package the Supralife alkaline batteries.
While it isn't clear whether there will be any write-offs,
Kodak said it doesn't expect any layoffs.
   The Supralife batteries are made at a plant in Columbus,
Ga., that's co-owned by Matsushita Electric Inc. Kodak says
that it is committed to that business, and that Supralife was
the fastest-growing brand of batteries in the U.S. in 1989,
albeit from a small base. "We did meet our expectations for
1989, and we're looking for a good 1990," a Kodak spokesman
said.
   Peter Enderlin, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co., noted that Kodak has had fairly good sales, but
difficulty getting market share. Indeed, the latest industry
figures, for November and December, show Kodak with a 7.6%
brand share of alkaline batteries in food, drug and mass
merchandise outlets. That compares with Rayovac's 8.7%,
Eveready's 35.9% and Duracell's 41.5%. Kodak's share had been
as high as 8.5% in May and June of last year. Alkaline
batteries represent about 82% of the $2.7 billion U.S.
battery market.
   "I think the whole business has been a disappointment to
them," said Mr. Enderlin. "I think they would like to sell
the rest if they could." Kodak has already consolidated its
once separate battery business and sales force into its
consumer imaging division.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Kodak shares closed at $39.75, down 12.5 cents.
