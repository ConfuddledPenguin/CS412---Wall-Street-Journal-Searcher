   OAKLAND, Calif. -- John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.,
the big Boston-based insurance and financial-services group,
boasts that its $53 million Freedom Environmental Fund is a
great way to participate in "the coming environmental
mobilization."
   But in Oakland, Peter Camejo, the president of Progressive
Asset Management Inc., calls that "an outrage." He says: "I'm
fed up with investment firms that are trying to cash in on
the environmental movement, and not really caring."

   Mr. Camejo, a 50-year-old onetime anti-Vietnam
demonstrator turned stockbroker, recently fired off letters
to the Securities and Exchange Commission charging that the
Hancock fund is misleading the public by advertising that
investors "could make a positive contribution toward cleaning
up the Earth" while investing in companies with what he
considers poor pollution records. He complains that one of
the fund's biggest holdings is Waste Management Inc., a
company with a long list of Environmental Protection Agency
violations.
   The reply from the Freedom Environmental Fund's portfolio
manager, David Beckwith, is equally intense. "There are no
pristine companies," he says, insisting Waste Management is
part of the solution instead of the problem. "They run the
cleanest landfill dumps in the business and have received a
lot of violations because they're easy to target," he says.
   As for Waste Management itself, it figures that "the scale
of our organization increases our chances to be in technical
noncompliance" with environmental laws, as William Plunkett,
a vice president for corporate communications, puts it. "We
are deeply committed to be in total compliance," he says --
adding that neither Progressive Asset nor Mr. Camejo "has
ever called on management or visited our facilities, although
they have a standing invitation to do so." He says analysts
and environmentalists "who've taken the time to get to know
us realize that our interests and interests of environmental
groups coincide."
   So it goes in the brave new world of "the Wall Street
greens," a fast-growing collection of brokers and investment
managers at the center of a booming investment field. Ever
since the Exxon Valdez hit a reef a year ago and oil-soaked
sea otters started washing up on the Alaska coast, many
investors have been seeking ways to make money and help save
the environment, all at the same time.
   Sometimes, however, environmental-fund operators seem to
spend much of their time arguing about who is greener than
whom -- and getting bogged down in abstruse scientific
debates.
   Some investment professionals suspect that such portfolio
managers' motives are a bit polluted themselves -- by
eagerness to make a buck. Environmental investing "is just
the latest marketing gimmick in a business with too much
competition," says Michael Stolper, a San Diego consultant
who selects money managers for wealthy clients. "It further
complicates the already-complicated process of picking
investments."
   The boom in environmental mutual funds is "a case where
marketing hoopla overrides investment good sense," adds Kurt
Brouwer, a partner in Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San Francisco
investment-management firm. Mutual-fund marketers "are trying
to jam these funds down people's throats because the
environment is a hot item," he says. Instead of investing in
these funds, people who want to help the environment should
donate 10% of their investment profits to organizations that
are cleaning up their local areas, he says.
   Many of the greens are former Vietnam-war protesters and
other 1960s people who have turned in their blue jeans and
tie-dyed T-shirts for button-down collars and jobs in the
investment business. They still believe passionately in their
causes, but now their arena is the investment business
instead of a university sit-in.
   Freedom Environmental, which was offered to the public for
the first time last fall, is one of four mutual funds riding
the environmental wave. Fidelity Investments' Select
Environmental Services Fund, which has raised $89 million
since it started last June, is the largest. At least three
more funds are opening soon.
   Other environmental investment vehicles include Merrill
Lynch Environmental Technology Trust, a unit trust of
pollution-cleanup stocks. It reached its $50 million goal in
a few days last fall, and $123 million flooded in before the
trust could be closed. A second trust -- which, like the
first, buys a portfolio of stocks but then doesn't trade them
-- has been opened and already has assets of $6.7 million.
   "We are giving the investor a direct play on the fastest
growth industry of the 1990s," says Larry Greenberg, manager
of Fidelity Environmental Services Fund.
   The surge of interest in environmental investing isn't
confined to individuals. More and more foundations, public
and private pension funds, universities, labor unions,
churches, insurers and banks are questioning their portfolio
managers about companies' environmental records. "The
environment is the social issue for institutional investors
now," says Suzanne Harvey, director of Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding Group's social-research service.
   Legislation requiring state pension-fund managers to "give
preference" to companies that comply with a corporate
environmental code known as the Valdez Principles has been
introduced in New York and New Jersey. A bill is expected
soon in the California legislature, and several other states
are studying this approach.
   Track records on environmental investing are scarce
because most of the funds are so new. But New Alternatives
Fund, which has been investing in alternative-energy
companies for five years, has a "pretty fair record," says A.
Michael Lipper, the president of Lipper Analytical Services,
which tracks mutual funds. In the 12 months through March 12,
New Alternatives achieved a total return of 12.9%, compared
with 12% for the average stock fund. In the past five years,
the fund has racked up a cumulative total return of 129.8%,
compared with 110.1% for the average equity fund.
   "In general, screening out environmental polluters
shouldn't affect your return," says William Constantine,
managing director of Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, a New York
investment firm. "There are plenty of stocks to accomplish
your investment results." In fact, avoiding companies
vulnerable to environmental lawsuits might be a way of
avoiding investments vulnerable to major, unpredictable
costs.
   The greatest interest from individual investors is in
California, the Pacific Northwest and New England. Brokers
and financial planners there who specialize in
environmentally conscious investments are thriving while much
of the retail brokerage business is in the doldrums.
   Carsten Hennigsen, the president of Progressive Securities
Inc., a Portland, Ore., brokerage firm specializing in
environmental investing, has opened two new offices in the
region. Gross revenue is up 160% from a year ago, he says.
First Affirmative Financial Network, of Colorado Springs,
Colo., says January was the "best month ever" because of
investor interest in the environment.
   Many "green" brokers are environmental activists who do
things that would turn a traditional broker's hair gray. For
example, David Hills, 35, a broker at A.G. Edwards Inc. in
Portsmouth, N.H., says he has been arrested four times for
demonstrating against the Seabrook nuclear-power plant in New
Hampshire. "I believe in environmental activism on the
weekend as well as shareholder activism," Mr. Hills says. "I
may climb over the fence at a nuclear plant, but I'm wearing
a tie and coat when I do it."
   Mr. Henningsen says he tries to talk customers out of
buying a stock if he thinks it doesn't measure up on
environmental grounds. If clients want to debate the issue,
he refers them to a staff member with a doctorate in business
ethics.
   Some environmentalist financial planners don't even go
into the office. Helene Robertson, 45, a Financial Network
Inc. planner, operates out of her Seattle home. In a room
filled with Northwest Indian art, she and three associates
screen investments for her 600 clients. You won't find any
Styrofoam cups or plastic spoons there. "We try to live it as
much as we can," she says.
   Typical clients of the Wall Street greens tend to be
professionals such as educators, therapists, nurses,
engineers, designers, attorneys, social workers, computer
programmers and doctors. Many are 35- to 45-year-old baby
boomers who may not have high-paying jobs but have inherited
portfolios of stocks that, for environmental reasons, they
dislike.
   "I am a child of the '60s, and I received an inheritance
which included stocks of agribusiness companies that made
chemical fertilizers and hormones for cows," says Susie
Dexter, a 40-year-old Seattle educator. She went to Ms.
Robertson for advice on how to clean her portfolio.
   Some investors don't even want to have their money-market
funds invest in the commercial paper -- the IOUs -- of
companies that allegedly pollute the environment. Lea Kouba,
45, a psychiatric social worker in Freeland, Wash., says she
has switched to Working Assets, a San Francisco money-market
fund that screens out commercial paper from such companies.
   "My amount won't change the world, but I feel I can be
part of a shift of consciousness toward the environment," she
says. "In the 1960s, we rebelled against the system. Now,
we've mellowed and are trying to work for change from
within."
   Environmental screening is complicated. Ms. Robertson
eliminates funds that invest in companies that own any of the
150 most toxic plants in the U.S. as defined by the National
Wildlife Federation. She says she ends up with a data base of
15 funds that are "clean" either "by design or by default."
Clean by default are small-stock funds such as Putnam OTC
Fund, Royce Value Fund and Review Management OTC Fund, she
says. Companies in these funds are in nonpolluting
industries. Clean by design funds include Calvert Ariel
Appreciation Fund and New Alternatives Fund.
   While many individual investors like to purge their
portfolios of companies with many environmental violations,
institutional investors want to look at the issue in more
depth, says Stephen Moody, senior portfolio manager of U.S.
Trust Co. in Boston. Sometimes they want to hold stock in a
company that is both part of the problem and the solution, he
says.
   Du Pont Co., for example, is the largest manufacturer of
chlorofluorocarbons, a gas used in auto air conditioners,
refrigerators, aerosol sprays and cleaning agents. CFCs have
been blamed for the Antarctic hole in the ozone layer that
protects the Earth from ultraviolet rays. That does it for
some individual investors.
   But Mr. Moody says some institutional clients continue to
hold Du Pont because they deem it the company most likely to
solve the problem. Du Pont has said it will suspend all CFC
production by the year 2000 or sooner, if possible. It is
developing substitutes for CFCs.
   Environmental investment people say environmentalists line
up on both sides of many such issues. "The decision comes
down to balancing trade-offs -- long-term and short-term
costs," says Mr. Henningsen, the Portland broker. "But we've
got to look at the environmental bottom line as well as the
financial bottom line."
   In the end, the future of environmental investing may
depend heavily on people such as Stuart Ruddick, a
31-year-old Bear Stearns broker in San Francisco. An avid
windsurfer, he has started a group called "Windsurfers for
Clearer Water." Munching on a hearts-of-lettuce salad in a
San Francisco restaurant, he comments: "San Francisco Bay is
almost dead because of toxic pollutants dumped into the
water."
   But in investing, "my bias is to make money for my
clients," Mr. Ruddick says. "I'm not a socially responsible
investor. I'm looking for companies with good products that
are well-positioned to take advantage of the clean air and
water acts."
   As the U.S. and other countries gear up to tackle such
problems, many more people may discern a confluence of
self-interest and social good. "Investment professionals have
a choice," says Ms. Harvey of Prudential-Bache. "They can
either view it as a dreadful bother that interferes with the
free flow of capital -- or a fantastic new business
opportunity."
