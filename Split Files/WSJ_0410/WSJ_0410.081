   MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. said it definitely agreed to
acquire Learjet Corp.'s assets and operations for US$75
million, a move that will boost the Canadian company's share
of the world market for corporate jets.
   Learjet is a unit of Integrated Resources Inc., which is
under Chapter 11 protection from creditors. The sale is
subject to bankruptcy court approval. An Integrated
spokeswoman said the New York insurance and mutual-fund
concern will apply this week for court approval of the
transaction.

   Bombardier also agreed to assume Learjet's short-term
debt, which won't exceed $38 million, a Bombardier official
said. Integrated will retain responsibility for certain legal
actions and other liabilities.
   "That sounds like a bargain," said Al Conklin, an aviation
consultant in Orleans, Mass. Mr. Conklin said Learjet is "at
the bottom of the ladder" in the business-jet market but an
acquisition by Bombardier would give the company "a big
boost" by simply providing stability. "One of the things
that's hurting {Learjet} more than anything else is the
instability of their parent," Mr. Conklin said.
   The acquisition of Learjet would make Bombardier a more
formidable player in the business-jet market by "providing us
with a much broader range of customers," said Andre
Bombardier, vice chairman of the transportation equipment,
defense products and aerospace concern.
   "The product lines complement each other very well," said
Brian E. Barents, chairman, president and chief executive
officer of Learjet, which is based in Wichita, Kan.
   Bombardier's Canadair division produces the Challenger, a
large business jet that seats as many as 19 people and sells
for about $15 million. Bombardier delivered 27 Challengers in
the year ended Jan. 31 and plans to deliver 27 or 28 jets
this fiscal year.
   Learjet's small and medium-sized jets seat as many as 10
people and sell for $3.8 million to $7.2 million. Learjet
delivered 25 planes last year and plans to deliver 30 this
year.
   After several bad years the market for corporate jets has
"bottomed out and turned up again," Mr. Conklin said. He
added that the market for bigger business jets such as
Bombardier's Challenger is in better shape than the market
for smaller planes such as Learjet's aircraft. Competition is
fierce, with a half-dozen U.S. and foreign manufacturers
chasing a market of 250 planes a year.
   After posting losses in the late 1980s, Learjet has been
profitable in the past two years, Mr. Barents said. Annual
sales are about $260 million, with a majority from aircraft
sales and the rest from defense subcontracting and aircraft
servicing.
   For the nine months ended Oct. 31, Bombardier reported net
income of $61.2 million Canadian dollars (US$52.4 million) or
91 Canadian cents a share, after including a special gain of
C$9.9 million. Revenue was C$1.26 billion.
   Analysts said the acquisition fits Bombardier's
bargain-hunting strategy. Bombardier got into the aerospace
industry by buying Canadair from the Canadian government.
Last year, Bombardier bought Northern Ireland's Short
Brothers PLC for about US$50 million from the British
government.
   Integrated, which bought Learjet in 1987, put the company
on the block seven months ago. At least one other possible
buyer lost interest after Integrated filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Learjet is one of the bigger assets left that Integrated
has been trying to sell to raise cash to pay off creditors,
who are owed a total of about US$1.8 billion.
   Just before Integrated sought Chapter 11 status Feb. 13,
Stephen D. Weinroth, chairman of Integrated, said the company
was on the verge of signing a letter of intent to sell
Learjet to Allen E. Paulson, founder of Gulfstream Aerospace,
for US$60 million. The filing apparently scuttled those
negotiations.
   On the Montreal Exchange, Bombardier Class A and Class B
shares closed at $15.625, up 12.5 Canadian cents. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Integrated closed at 25
cents, down 1/32.
