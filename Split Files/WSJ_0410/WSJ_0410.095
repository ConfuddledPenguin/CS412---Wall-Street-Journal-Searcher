   The group said it acquired its Transcon stock for
investment purposes, but that its intentions are "subject to
continual review and re-evaluation."
   Other group members are James D. Burke, president of
Truck-a-Way, and Andrew J. Collins Jr., an officer and
director of Metropolitan Trust Co., a Sherwood, Ark.,
diversified real estate concern.
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., Transcon officials couldn't be
reached to comment on the Truck-a-Way stake. Transcon, a
trucking company, earlier this month said it sold its
Transcon Lines carrier to closely held, Miami-based Growth
Finance Corp. The price wasn't disclosed. It said the unit in
1989 had revenue of $226.5 million and operating losses of
$31.6 million.
