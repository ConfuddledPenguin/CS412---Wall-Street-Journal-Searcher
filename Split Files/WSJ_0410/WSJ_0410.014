   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp., the
savings-and-loan bailout agency that has been bogged down for
months, is promising to sell insolvent S&amp;Ls at a blistering
pace under a new plan to unload the thrifts in smaller
pieces.
   The agency has sold 52 thrifts since it was created eight
months ago. But it now plans to sell or liquidate 140 in the
next 90 days.

   Agency officials say they can cut through bureaucratic red
tape by using broad new guidelines that give buyers more
flexibility to decide which S&amp;L investments to take over. The
new policy will allow buyers to bid solely on the "core"
institution -- consisting of a thrift's deposits and
securities holdings.
   The bidder may also bid separately on the S&amp;Ls' riskier
investments, or it may eschew those bad assets altogether.
Those assets would remain with the government for later sale.
The plan also gives the buyers up to 18 months, instead of
the current six, to decide which assets to keep and which to
give back to the thrift agency.
   "I think what they are doing is smart," says Clay Lebhar,
managing director of the financial institutions group of
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding. "All things considered, it
should increase the appetite for these troubled institutions.
It's a plus to the process."
   By isolating the bad assets, potential buyers won't have
to spend so much time and money on examining the thrifts
before making a bid. Industry executives believe that will
broaden the field of bidders, and the thrift agency says it
could halve the time and manpower required for buyers to
analyze the thrifts.
   For example, NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., dispatched a
few dozen executives to University Savings Association in
Houston, a $2.8 billion thrift saddled with bad real estate
loans and a liquidity crunch. The team spent more than a week
reviewing loan files, computer systems, and the branch
network before compiling its bid and acquiring the thrift.
NCNB was one of just four bidders, because few others were
willing to commit such manpower and money to an analysis,
which might not lead to a winning bid. Other buyers have said
such analysis of a large institution might require six
months.
   Frank Gentry, senior vice president of corporate strategy
and planning of NCNB, says the bank, on the prowl for other
thrifts, could face more competition. "I think you are going
to see more bidding because of" the new policy, he said. "The
RTC has learned from its bidding so far."
   So far, sales by the thrift agency have ultimately left
the government holding almost all the bad assets of the
thrifts it sells, and the new strategy won't reduce that
liability at all. But some analysts believe the agency may
wring more value from selling the core of the S&amp;L franchises
quickly, before they diminish in value by languishing in
government hands for months.
   "They are trying to save the women and children at least,"
says Karen Shaw of the Institute for Strategy Development, a
Washington research firm.
   Moreover, the thrift agency just announced it will permit
banks buying S&amp;Ls to retain the thrifts' branch networks,
even if some state laws impose limitations on banks' buying
of branches. The agency contends it has the authority under
the S&amp;L bailout and restructuring law passed last year. Such
a policy could attract more banks to the sick S&amp;Ls.
   A wave of swift sales would be a huge shot in the arm for
the agency, which has been thwarted by funding problems,
political fights, and most important, a lack of buyers. Just
yesterday, the White House acknowledged that the bailout plan
is likely to cost far more than its original $166 billion
estimate over 10 years, but didn't specify how much more. The
General Accounting Office currently puts that figure at $243
billion.
   Most recently, the bailout was on hold because of
confusion over a court ruling that the nation's top thrift
regulator hadn't been appointed to his post constitutionally.
That ruling was effectively nullified when the Senate last
week confirmed Timothy Ryan as director for the Office of
Thrift Supervision. Mr. Ryan was sworn in yesterday. A
spokesman for the agency says several sales that were in the
pipeline before the court ruling may be announced this week.
   The agency, he said, has also begun marketing 87
institutions -- those not targeted for liquidation -- in
earnest. It sent to 1,000 prospective thrift buyers
information about the thrifts, which include CenTrust Bank in
Miami, where losses may exceed $2 billion, and 10 other
failed thrifts with assets over $500 million.
   It will hold seminars this month in Houston and Dallas
outlining how to bid for the S&amp;Ls or their assets. The RTC
also recently entered into an agreement with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. to borrow whatever manpower is needed
for the 50 or so liquidations that are planned.
   "It may be ambitious, but we are hopeful that we can meet
these goals," says Sherwin Koopmans, who heads the marketing
effort for the thrift agency.
