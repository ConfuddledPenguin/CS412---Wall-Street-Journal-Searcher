   SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it
expected to post flat first-quarter revenue, lower than the
company had anticipated.
   However, Advanced Micro said an extraordinary gain from a
previously announced technology transfer with Sony Corp.
pushed first-quarter net income above the nine cents a share
it earned in the year-earlier period.

   Advanced Micro said revenue was about the same as the
$269.6 million the semiconductor concern generated in 1989's
first quarter. It didn't give an estimate for per-share
earnings. The company blamed the revenue results on
lower-than-anticipated prices on chip products, notably
Eproms, a type of chip that is one of Advanced Micro's main
products.
   Advanced Micro has been struggling for many quarters to
overcome problems stemming from a broad slump in the chip
industry and some basic strategic errors. Its results for the
latest quarter mirror the problems encountered by several
other chip makers.
   W.J. Sanders, chairman and chief executive officer, said
orders picked up late in the period, especially in
international markets. He said that increase, coupled with
already-implemented cost cutting measures, should result in
better operating margins in the current quarter.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Advanced Micro
closed at $8.50, down 37.5 cents.
