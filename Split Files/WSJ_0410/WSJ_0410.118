   The semiconductor industry's leading indicator rose for
the third consecutive month in March, signaling that the
industry's modest rebound from depressed sales in the last
half of 1989 is continuing.
   Doug Andrey, director of statistics for the Semiconductor
Industry Association, which compiles the widely watched sales
indicator, called April's improvement "mild" and said chip
sales for the year are still expected to be about 3.5% below
last year's levels. "We won't see strong growth until 1991,"
he said.

   The association said the so-called "book-to-bill" ratio
for April climbed to 1.09 from 1.05 in February. Chip
billings for March totaled $1.3 billion, 15.2% higher than
February's $1.1 billion and 5.3% lower than a year earlier.
   Average monthly orders for the three months ended in March
totaled $1.27 billion, 5.4% above February's figure and 0.2%
higher than a year earlier.
