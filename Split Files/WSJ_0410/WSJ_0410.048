   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. said first-quarter net income
fell 88% to $24.9 million, or 25 cents a share, from $200
million, or $1.99 a share, in the year-earlier period, which
included a $164.1 million, or $1.63 a share, gain, from the
sale of an investment in a cable-system operator.
   Excluding the year-earlier one-time gain, net fell 31%.

   Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said
operating income from its business publications segment rose
20% to $26.2 million from $21.8 million. But the increase was
more than offset by a 35% decline in operating income from
information services, to $35.8 million from $54.6 million.
The decline was attributable mostly to losses from a
foreign-exchange trading service being introduced by the
Telerate Inc. subsidiary.
   Dow Jones noted that the year-to-year first-quarter
comparison for information services operating income is
distorted by the inclusion this year of 100% of the expenses
of developing The Trading Service; a year ago, the service
hadn't begun operation, half its development losses were
being borne by a 50% partner, since bought out, and
Telerate's share of those losses wasn't included in operating
results but was reported as an investment by the equity
method of accounting.
   Dow Jones's first-quarter operating income fell 22% to $62
million from $79.8 million. Revenue rose 5% to $427.1 million
from $406.8 million.
   Net also was reduced by increased interest expense and
goodwill amortization related to Dow Jones's acquisition of
Telerate, completed in January 1990, by a decline in
operating income at the community newspapers segment, and by
a higher effective tax rate.
   Information services segment revenue rose 9% to $184.3
million. Excluding Telerate, revenue from the information
services group, which includes Dow Jones News Services and
Dow Jones News/Retrieval, rose 7.9%.
   Revenue for business publications, which includes The Wall
Street Journal and its overseas editions, Barron's magazine
and other publications, increased 3.5% to $189.3 million;
operating income for the segment showed the third consecutive
quarterly increase. Journal advertising linage in the quarter
declined 3.9%; Barron's linage rose 2.1%.
   Operating income of Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community
newspapers segment, fell 39% to $4.5 million; revenue
decreased 2.5% to $53.4 million. Advertising linage at the 23
daily newspapers fell 8.8% in the quarter.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Dow Jones closed at $28.875, down 25 cents.
