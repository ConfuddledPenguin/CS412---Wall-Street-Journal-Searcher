   NEW YORK -- Investors who buy stock and those who bet on
price declines by selling short often accuse each other of
dirty tricks. From time to time, they're both right.
   The stock market in recent weeks has seen plenty of
questionable ploys -- from false rumor-mongering to what some
pros term "mull jobs."

   Take Jan Bell Marketing. Its shares, several money
managers say, have been hurt by vicious rumors. Based in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., Jan Bell sells jewelry through membership
warehouse retailers such as Price Co. and Sam's (a unit of
Wal-Mart Stores). Jan Bell's stock, which traded above 30
last fall, closed at 9 7/8 yesterday.
   To be sure, Jan Bell's horizon isn't cloudless. It is
losing most of the business it used to do with Price Co., for
example. But part of the stock's decline has been fed by
rumors with no substantiation. Among them: that Jan Bell had
paid kickbacks to employees at Price Co. and Sam's; that it
had sold zirconium disguised as diamonds, and that it had
sold diamonds containing fewer carats than represented. The
company denies each of these rumors, and several money
managers who follow Jan Bell closely say they are untrue.
   "It gets me mad, to see people lie maliciously about it,"
says Richard Welty, senior portfolio manager at Lateef
Management Associates in San Francisco. He says Jan Bell's
contract with Sam's allows Sam's to conduct surprise audits
of merchandise three or four times a year. "Those have always
proved Jan Bell erred on the side of quality," he says. Mr.
Welty looks for Jan Bell to earn 90 cents to $1 a share this
year, compared with 80 cents in 1989.
   "Jan Bell is revolutionizing the way jewelry is sold in
this country," says Dana Telsey, retail analyst at Baron
Capital Inc. in New York. "They're giving consumers a better
deal" and achieving unusually high sales per square foot of
retail space, she says. "We like the management and think
they're smart."
   One rumor named a specific employee of Sam's who
supposedly was fired for taking kickbacks from Jan Bell. In
fact, the employee left for a better-paying job at another
firm, according to Mr. Welty and other people familiar with
the situation.
   Another type of rumor, which has affected the stocks of
several companies and is almost impossible to disprove, is a
whisper that executives use cocaine. This one works best
against companies with high-style, fast-track executives. Of
course, many short-sellers are as revolted by such tactics as
other investors are.
   Just as stocks can be pushed down by tricks, they can also
be pulled up. "One generic April fool's joke . . . is the
buy-out rumor," says Jim Grant, editor of Grant's Interest
Rate Observer. "Before Integrated Resources tragically hit
the wall, it was rumored that the company was going to be
taken over at some high premium."
   Stock prices can also be boosted by tactics aimed at
twisting short sellers' arms. Shorts borrow stock and
immediately sell it. Eventually, they must buy shares to
replace the ones they borrowed. That's called "covering." If
a stock falls a lot before they cover, short sellers profit.
But a "buy-in" can make shorts cover before they want to.
   In a buy-in, someone who has lent stock to a short seller
demands its return. (Lenders are often institutions, which
get a 1% fee for lending the shares.) Sometimes, buy-ins can
be deliberately orchestrated, as a company -- or people who
own its stock -- press stock lenders to call back their
shares.
   In some cases, traders know or sense that a buy-in is
imminent. They can make a short-term profit by loading up on
the stock and bidding up its price, knowing that short
sellers will soon be forced to buy it.
   "There seems to be a remarkable coincidence of stocks
appreciating intraday just before a buy-in," says David
Rocker, head of Rocker Partners, a New York investment firm
that takes both short and long positions. He says the trend
has accelerated lately.
   Mr. Rocker was irked when GV Medical shares rose 40% in a
single day last month, the day he was bought in. The shares
fell the next day and have since hit a new low.
   GV Medical's president and chief executive, James R.
Grabek, says he doesn't know what caused the March 20 jump,
or whether word leaked out in advance that a buy-in was about
to happen. But he wasn't shedding any tears for the shorts.
"I like to hear about cases where they are the victims," he
said. "In the majority of cases, the small high-tech
companies are the victims." He said GV Medical stock has been
buffeted by rumors "that I'm leaving, that I'm sick, that
we've altered data," none of which was true.
   Shorts also complain about what Mark Cohodes of Rocker
Partners calls "mull jobs," in which a company trying to
offset bad news says it is "mulling" a leveraged buy-out or
is in discussions with unidentified parties who may be
interested in buying the company. Typically, he says, no
transaction ensues.
   At the moment, Mr. Cohodes is indignant about a late-March
announcement by Child World that its parent company has "been
approached by and (has) held discussions with various third
parties including potential acquirers of Child World."
   The announcement said "there is no assurance" that any
transaction will occur. But Mr. Cohodes wonders why the
announcement came almost simultaneously with the release of
disappointing earnings news. Why, he asks, did Child World
wait until March 29 to announce that it was having
discussions with potential acquirers, if those discussions
began some time earlier?
   Child World's chief executive, Peter J. Hayes, couldn't be
reached for comment. Another company official declined to
comment; a third didn't return calls.

   A bitter rival of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group has scooped
up the firm's coveted list of junk bond clients.
   The list is going to Salomon Brothers, which has been
striving to bolster its clout in the $200 billion market for
publicly traded junk bonds.
   The price wasn't disclosed, but Wall Street traders said
they believe it was in the neighborhood of $2 million. Drexel
had put the list up for sale to raise funds to satisfy
creditors after filing for bankuptcy-law protection in
February.
   Salomon Inc.'s securities unit outbid 14 other Wall Street
firms for exclusive use of Drexel's computer data bases and
integrated software system. The data, which include names,
contacts and trading histories for about 3,000 junk issues,
was a critical cog in Drexel's junk-bond prowess.
   "It gives them a diary on how to do deals," says Kevin
Risen, financial services analyst at Banc One Asset
Management Corp. The select list, Mr. Risen notes, includes
the critical element of "who to look for to do business
with."
   The purchase is part of a broad move by Salomon to
establish itself as a force in the high-yield junk market.
Besides the data base system, Salomon in recent weeks has
hired several former junk-bond experts from Drexel, including
research head Joseph Bencivenga -- a chief architect of the
data base system while at Drexel -- and top salesman Donald
Mullen.
   The connection between the two firms raised eyebrows on
Wall Street. Salomon, never a heavy hitter in junk, at times
criticized Drexel's heavy use of junk bonds. And some
analysts question how important the data are now that the
junk-bond market has collapsed.
   Salomon officials say the information will beef up their
firm's service to clients and ability to make markets in the
secondary, or resale, sector. Drexel has assured Salomon that
it purchased exclusive rights to the system, they add. Some
traders question the data's usefulness, however, noting that
many laid-off Drexel employees saw at least some of it before
leaving the firm.
   The data base will give Salomon salesmen, traders and
research staffers on-line access to a wide range of
information on Drexel's junk-bond clients. These include the
descriptions of the issuers and Drexel's guide to pricing
junk bonds -- a ticklish matter amid the recent turmoil in
the junk market.
   The data "includes where the bonds are and who the
customers are," says Mark Field, managing director and head
of Salomon's high-yield sales group. Mr. Field says the
system includes data on about 500 private transactions and
the portfolios of about 1,000 institutions.
   "This will help Salomon in its attempt to build better
longer-term relationships," says Perrin Long, senior
securities analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. "If
nothing else, it lets them know who exactly makes the
decisions -- and that in many instances is a hard thing to
come by."
