   WASHINGTON -- Budd Co. agreed to pay $1.5 million to
settle Labor Department charges of workplace noise and other
safety and health violations at the company's Philadelphia
automotive-panel plant.
   Budd also agreed to set up corporatewide worker-hearing
conservation and record-keeping programs, the department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said. Budd,
based in Troy, Mich., and a unit of Thyssen AG in West
Germany, agreed to the settlement without admitting the
alleged violations.

   OSHA last December proposed penalties totaling $3.3
million against Budd for the alleged Philadelphia violations.
But as with many accords, the regulatory agency agreed to the
smaller fine in return for a commitment for corporatewide
abatement of the alleged unsafe practices.
   At the time, the $3.3 million was the fourth-largest
proposed penalty for a company in OSHA history. The agency
had charged Budd with noise-rule violations, including
failure to tell workers they had suffered hearing loss and to
have doctors review problem cases; with violations of
engineering-control regulations; and with willful violations
of record-keeping rules, such as the required notation of
medical treatment for injuries.
   The agreement calls for Budd to reduce excessive noise at
the Philadelphia plant by April 30, 1991, and to begin a
hearing-conservation program at all its facilities by Sept.
1, 1990.
   Budd also will audit injury and illness record-keeping
since Jan. 1, 1987, to see that the records comply with
federal requirements, and to keep future records in
compliance, OSHA said.
