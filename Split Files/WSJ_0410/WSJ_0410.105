   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. soon will introduce its
first presweetened cereal for kids in 15 years, a four-grain
flaked product called Bigg Mixx.
   The ready-to-eat product includes rolled oats, rice,
toasted corn flakes and whole-grain wheat, flavored with
brown sugar and cinnamon. One variety also comes with
raisins.

   Most of Bigg Mixx's $22 million rollout budget will focus
on a fanciful creature -- part chicken, wolf, moose and pig
-- that will speak for the product. The character, named for
the cereal, joins Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam in Kellogg's
marketing menagerie.
   The last successful presweetened item from the world's
largest maker of ready-to-eat cereals was Frosted Krispies, a
1975 rollout.
   Kellogg's hopes for a new hit with kids and their parents
last year was S.W. Graham, a graham-flour cereal with a
nostalgia advertising campaign. But when initial sales didn't
meet expectations, the company quietly took it off the
market.
