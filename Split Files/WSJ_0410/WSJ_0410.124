   ("Survey Finds 25% of Work Force Has Anxiety Disorder,
Stress-Linked Illness." -- WSJ headline)
                                                                                                       

   Sometimes it's fellow workers
   Who can have one annoyed;
   Sometimes it's the surroundings
   That one cannot avoid;
   Sometimes it is the boss
   In whom faith is destroyed --
   None of which explains my case,
   Since I am self-employed.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   Shorter Is Better
                                                                                                       

   Clergy should know that their sermons,
   Which guide to heaven's portal,
   Need not be eternal
   In order to be immortal.
   -- George O. Ludcke.
