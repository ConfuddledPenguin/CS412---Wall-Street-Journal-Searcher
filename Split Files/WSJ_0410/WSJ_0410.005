   PepsiCo Inc. said it signed a new trade agreement that
will more than double its sales in the Soviet Union during
the next 10 years.
   The agreement gives Pepsi a chance to expand its lead
against Coca-Cola Co. in the coveted and underdeveloped
Soviet market. On a per-capita basis, the Soviets drink about
one-tenth as much soft drinks as their U.S. counterparts.
Although Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi world-wide more than
2-to-1, Pepsi has the lead in certain key markets, notably
the Soviet Union and India.

   Pepsi, whose 18-year-old countertrade agreement in the
Soviet Union has involved trading Pepsi-Cola concentrate for
Stolichnaya Russian vodka, called the new agreement the
largest trade pact between a U.S. company and the Soviet
Union. In Moscow, retired Pepsi Chairman Donald M. Kendall,
the architect of Pepsi's Soviet business during the past
three decades, said the Purchase, N.Y., company would spend
more than $1 billion to upgrade and expand bottling plants
and to provide concentrate, among other things.
   The new accord, first reported in the New York Times,
continues the vodka-concentrate trades. Moreover, Pepsi will
help the Soviets sell or lease 10 commercial ships in
international markets. The ships will provide Pepsi with
foreign exchange credits, part of which will be used to open
the first Pizza Hut restaurants in Moscow later this year.
Pepsi owns the Pizza Hut chain.
   Such exotic countertrade measures are necessary for
companies doing business in countries, such as the Soviet
Union, that don't have hard currency. In China, for example,
Pepsi trades its soft drinks for Chinese mushrooms, which, in
turn, end up on Pizza Hut pizzas.
   But countertrades have had a checkered history in the
Soviet Union. Perhaps one of the most notable examples
involves Occidental Petroleum Corp. and a purported $20
billion, 20-year exchange of fertilizer chemicals with the
Soviets. By all indications, the agreement, signed in the
1970s, has fallen well short of initial projections.
   Occidental says contract shipments "have been running
smoothly" but declines to disclose revenue from the trade.
According to the company's annual report, only 60% of
fertilizer-chemical capacity built to serve the Soviet trade
is actually being used for that purpose.
   Pepsi, which has marketed soft drinks in the Soviet Union
since 1972, said it sold about 40 million cases there last
year. Pepsi-Cola was the first Western consumer product sold
in the Soviet Union. Coke, which has sold its Fanta brand
there since 1979 and its Coca-Cola brand only since 1985,
said its volume was less than 20 million cases in 1989.
   Beyond the soft-drink volume to be generated, Pepsi's new
agreement gives the company a critical asset in its
dark-horse campaign to catch Coke overseas in the soft-drink
business: bragging rights. Historically, Pepsi has motivated
its overseas bottlers, sometimes beleaguered by the
overwhelming strength of Coke, by pointing boastfully to big
markets where Pepsi leads its Atlanta-based rival. "So much
of this business," said Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade
magazine Beverage Digest, "is motivation."
   Under the Soviet accord, Pepsi said it will more than
double the number of its plants to 50 from 24. The cost of
the new plants will be paid off mostly with proceeds from the
vodka sales, Pepsi said. The accord also extends for 10 years
Pepsi's exclusive rights to provide Russian vodka to the U.S.
   Pepsi said the agreement would provide the equivalent of
more than $3 billion in retail sales of Pepsi-Cola and
Stolichnaya vodka over 10 years. However, a spokesman
wouldn't estimate how much sales would actually end up on
Pepsi's books.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pepsi closed at $66.50, up $1.50.
