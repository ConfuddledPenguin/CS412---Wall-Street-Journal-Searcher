   I was caught off-guard by Dave Shiflett's March 20 Leisure
&amp; Arts review, "Flame-Broiled Marxist." Near the end of his
article Mr. Shiflett mentions a chorale from the SS Hymnal.
   As one partial to supply-side economics, I would hate to
see the SS acronym catch on. However, there is a fair degree
of black humor in the phrase "SS Hymnal." Maybe you could
nominate it for "Oxymoron of the Year."
