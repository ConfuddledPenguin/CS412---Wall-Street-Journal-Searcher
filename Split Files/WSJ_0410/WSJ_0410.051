   When Sominex wanted to convey a feeling of comfort in its
new TV and radio commercials that premiered in February, it
used a woman's voice to deliver its soothing message.
   "We wanted to get across a lullaby, and a woman's voice is
more comforting," says Sandor Katz, director of brand
management at SmithKline Beecham Consumer Brands, the
manufacturer of Sominex, an over-the-counter sleep aid.

   Unfortunately, that news isn't so comforting to women, at
least those women who make their living as voice-over
announcers for radio and television advertisements.
Television shows are fast breaking down stereotypes of
women's and men's work, say the Screen Actors Guild as well
as casting directors and advertising agencies, but the
lucrative voice-over business is still virtually an all-male
club.
   "Why hasn't advertising changed?" asks Deidre Westervelt,
chairwoman of the women's voice-over committee of the Screen
Actors Guild. "We're still selling hair spray and panty hose.
But many of the people who buy the products that are
advertised by men are women." Men are used more than women
because, Ms. Westervelt says, "it's a tradition."
   In the ad business, male voices are considered more
authoritative. Women are mainly relegated to products such as
cosmetics and feminine hygiene products, although some women
are being used for airlines, usually considered a "male"
product, such as Sabena Airlines.
   "For every ten commercials, only one is voiced by a
woman," says Dan Ingram, a former disk jockey who now voices
commercials and who is a vice president of the Screen Actors
Guild, which represents commercial announcers, among others.
"I want to compete on equal footing with women in auditions.
It's getting a bit better. Auditions are becoming more
asexual."
   Women say they have a long way to go. Several years ago,
the Screen Actors Guild established its women's voice-over
committee in New York to heighten ad agencies' awareness of
the problem.
   Ms. Westervelt monitored two network newscasts as well as
the syndicated "Entertainment Tonight" on a recent evening
and found the scale heavily tilted toward male announcers.
Only one commercial of 14 on the "CBS Evening News" featured
a woman; three out of 15 on "NBC Nightly News" had female
announcers. On the 15 commercials during "Entertainment
Tonight," three were handled by women.
   Of course, there are female celebrities who do well in
commercial announcing, including Sally Kellerman, who starred
in the movie "MASH."
   But the Screen Actors Guild is fighting for the average
announcer. For instance, the union commissioned a study three
years ago in which focus groups heard commercials that were
identical except that one was produced with a male announcer,
the other with a female announcer.
   The audience couldn't determine which was more effective.
"That study is as fresh as tomorrow's newspaper," says Mr.
Ingram. "Not much has changed, unfortunately."
   Casting directors say they try to change things subtly
when approaching a client who specifies a male announcer.
   Joan Lynn, who heads a commercial casting agency, says she
sometimes "sticks one or two women onto a sample audiotape"
that is comprised of men. "Those clients tell me they want a
50-year-old, aggressive, good, rich-sounding man," says Ms.
Lynn. "Sometimes I like to surprise them. Women can be as
memorable as men."
   There are no exact figures to the number of men in
commercials compared with the number of women. But even
creative directors admit to the discrepancy. "Why don't we
have a woman advertising our product? That's a good question
that I don't know the answer to," says William A. Wohlfeil,
vice-president of marketing for NutraSweet. "It's something
to consider."
   One advantage to using women, says Ms. Westervelt, is that
since there are so few used, "the sound of a woman tends to
break through the sameness of all commercials. It cuts
through the clutter."

   Schering Ad Consolidation
                                                                                                       

   Schering-Plough's Health-Care Products division
consolidated its $60 million to $70 million ad account at
three New York agencies.
   Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore and Della Femina McNamee WCRS, both
current Schering-Plough agencies, were named to handle
additional brands. Cadwell Davis Partners, a Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi agency, was also assigned several brands. Previous
agencies include Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer;
Bloom Agency; and Ketchum Advertising, which will handle
sales promotion and public relations for some products.
   An executive close to Schering-Plough said total billings
will be more or less shared equally among the the three
agencies. The company handles media buying in-house.

plan to make a bid for the company.
