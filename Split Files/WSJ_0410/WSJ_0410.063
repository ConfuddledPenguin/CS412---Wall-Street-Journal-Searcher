   S&amp;L AND BANK EXECUTIVES face tough times in the job
market.
   Government takeovers, liquidations and mergers spawn too
many job hunters for too few slots, says placement specialist
Ken Richardson, a Bethesda, Md., placement man. Randy Hill,
now a partner at search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles, says job
placement for bank and thrift managers is "way down" -- by
50% in the past six months at his former firm. "I have four
resumes on my desk from guys who made $100,000 or more," a
Mellon Bank official says.

   But high-paid "turnaround" experts, who revive failing
S&amp;Ls, are in big demand, says search firm Korn/Ferry
International. Resolution Trust Corp., the bailout agency,
"is sucking up most of the good liquidators," it says.
Regulators also want to place thrift wizards at
government-run S&amp;Ls, says search firm Spencer-Stuart.
   The job pinch forces many executives to change careers,
says placement firm Carrington Sloane Associates.
                                                                                                       

   SERVICE FIRMS STRUGGLE to measure and boost productivity.
   For most, gauging "output" per bank, hotel or office
worker is tricky, but they try harder. Olsten Corp., a
temporary-help firm; Avis, and Rosenbluth Travel, in
Philadelphia, survey customer views as a productivity proxy.
Meridian Bancorp. uses such results to urge employees to
respond better on the phone and focus on customers' special
needs. Rosenbluth measures how fast phone calls are handled.
   Uno Restaurant Corp. controls eatery staffing closely.
Sonesta International Hotels tries to curb turnover by giving
workers good food and clean locker rooms, but says it can't
make bellhops "work twice as fast." Quality Inns tracks
minutes to clean a room and meals served each hour; it
monitors reservationists, who turned 34.7% of calls into
bookings in 1989, up a bit from '88.
                                                                                                       

   THE PLOT THICKENS in the retiree age-bias controversy.
   Legislation is afoot to overturn a 1989 Supreme Court
ruling that gave employers wide leeway to restrict retiree
benefits. The ruling reversed an appeals court decision
favoring June Betts, who had to retire at 61 after six years
as an Ohio speech pathologist because of Alzheimer's disease.
She was over 59, so the state denied disability.
   On remand, the appeals court has ruled for Mrs. Betts
again, saying she was involuntarily retired. ERIC, an
employer group, says the "Older Workers" bill now isn't
needed. But its backers, saying the latest court ruling won't
hold, want a return to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission's pre-Betts policy of allowing lower benefits for
older workers only if equal benefits mean higher costs than
for younger ones.
   The EEOC was litigating 32 retiree age-bias cases when the
high court ruled; many cases were dismissed.
                                                                                                       

   GETTING THE MESSAGE: As OSHA gears up for a bigger attack
on workplace cumulative trauma disorders, such as injury from
repeated wrist and arm motions, the Jefferson Group lobbyists
will urge a corporate coalition to tackle the problem.
                                                                                                       

   SUBSIDIZED MORTGAGES will be expanded from high-paid
faculty to include University of Pennsylvania junior faculty
and clerical, maintenance, nursing and technical staff. The
college's $3 million program will initially offer 8.35%
loans, nearly two points below the market.
                                                                                                       

   A MIGHTY TASK faces a coal-mine health-cost commission
named by Labor Secretary Dole, an Employee Benefit Research
Institute report suggests. It shows that Mine Workers'
benefit-funds' medical costs in 1988 were as much as 150%
higher than those of the average U.S. employer; retirees bear
a low share of expenses, and grandchildren are covered, EBRI
notes.
                                                                                                       

   "OPEN WINDOW" early retirement plans were offered since
1983 by 54% of 145 large firms polled by consultant Towers
Perrin, and some 25% more may do so this year. The plans
typically give employees 55 or older a month or so to accept
enhanced offers to leave early. But the age-bias bill may
keep windows shut, Towers warns.
                                                                                                       

   OIL-SPILL CLEANUPS still protect workers poorly, unions
say.
   Over 1,000 untrained workers were sent to clean up the
recent spill off Huntington Beach, Calif., says the Laborers'
union; finding trained people quickly was difficult, OSHA
says. With the Alaska cleanup of last year's Exxon Valdez
spill to resume May 1, Exxon's training falls short of legal
requirements, the union says. Exxon says that it and state
and federal officials agree that it will meet OSHA training
rules this year.
   A team headed by former OSHA chief Eula Bingham, sent to
Valdez a year ago by a Laborers' health fund, found
inadequate protective gear and worksite hygiene; it said
workers wore oil-soaked clothing and had oil on their faces
and hands. Workers compensation claims soared. Breathing
protectors often aren't provided for many spills, the
Operating Engineers union says.
   Oil and its vapors can cause nausea, breathing difficulty,
rash, kidney and nervous-system damage, and cancer.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: 9to5, National Association of Working Women,
starts a contest for stories of good and bad bosses. . . .
Two-tier pay contracts rose to 6% of new labor pacts last
year from 5% in 1988, reversing a three-year decline, the
Bureau of National Affairs says. . . . Ben Burdetsky, a
George Washington University labor-relations professor, gave
seminars for South Korean employers and labor leaders before
their annual bargaining this month.
