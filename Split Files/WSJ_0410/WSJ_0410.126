   DETROIT -- Salaries went up but bonuses went down for top
executives at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. last
year, according to the auto makers' 1990 proxy statements.
   The lower bonuses reflect lower earnings in 1989, with
GM's net income off 13% and Ford's down 28%, after a
write-off from the sale of its steel subsidiary. Both
companies have changed their bonus programs over the past few
years to tie compensation more closely to achievement of
long-range goals. Last year was the second in a row that
Ford's highest officials saw their bonuses decline from
year-earlier levels.

   Still, recently retired Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen
once again outearned his GM peer, Roger B. Smith, in total
compensation: Mr. Petersen received nearly $6.6 million to
Mr. Smith's $2.5 million. Some $3.5 million of Mr. Petersen's
compensation total came from the exercise of stock options;
Mr. Smith didn't exercise any stock options in 1989.
   The $1,530,874 salary Mr. Petersen received last year
represented a 34% increase from his 1988 salary. But his
$1,518,800 in 1989 supplemental compensation -- or bonus --
was 31% less than he pulled down a year earlier.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Smith received $1,092,000 in salary in
1989, an 11% increase from $983,000 in 1988, while his 1989
bonus fell about 7% to $1.4 million from $1.5 million in
1988.
   "The big buck syndrome in Detroit is a disease that's
still in need of a cure," complained United Auto Workers
union officials. GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. all face
difficult contract negotiations with the UAW this summer. The
union has already criticized reduced profit-sharing payments
to hourly workers at GM and Ford.
   Chrysler, which will disclose its proxy statement Friday,
didn't pay any bonuses to its top managers because it didn't
make enough money to pay profit sharing to its hourly
workers. The agreement that triggered Chrysler's move was
negotiated with the union in 1988. "GM and Ford can expect to
hear more from us on this subject during forthcoming contract
talks," the UAW leaders said.
   Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman since the Feb. 28
retirement of Mr. Petersen, outearned his counterpart, Robert
C. Stempel, currently GM's president and the man slated to
succeed Mr. Smith on Aug. 1. Mr. Poling, who was Ford's vice
chairman last year, received $2,934,688 in total compensation
for 1989, with his salary rising 25% to $1,188,594. His bonus
fell 40% however, to $960,000.
   Total compensation for Mr. Stempel rose 12.5% to
$2,096,820 in 1989, which included a 15% increase in salary
to $725,000 and a 5% decline in bonus payments to $1,050,000.
Mr. Poling received $786,094 from the exercise of stock
options; Mr. Stempel received $321,820.
   Ford also disclosed in its proxy statement a new board
policy that automatically defers the portion of executive
bonuses that exceed $600,000 or 150% of base salary,
whichever is greater. The excess is converted into rights to
common stock that can't be claimed until after the executives
turn 62 or 18 months after they leave the company. The
executives also can lose the rights by, among other things,
immediately going to work for a competitor.
   As previously reported, Mr. Petersen isn't standing for
re-election as a director. Former Chairman Philip Caldwell,
who has reached the mandatory retirement age of 70, also
isn't up for re-election.
   In its proxy statement, GM said it is asking holders to
approve a plan that would increase to 500 million from 190
million the number of authorized Class E shares, which
reflect a dividend interest in GM's Electronic Data Systems
computer services unit. The company said it hasn't any
immediate plans to issue additional Class E shares but
believes the authorization increase "is needed to provide
flexibility for possible future actions such as additional
stock dividends, splits or acquisitions."
