   WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. said it signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Telecom USA Inc., the
nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier, for $42 a
share, or about $1.25 billion.
   The friendly acquisition will give MCI greater strength in
the midlevel business market as well as access to several
innovative Telecom products, such as its calling card and
voice-messaging service. Telecom, with 1989 sales of $713
million, has been growing 25% to 30% a year, and at the end
of last year had a little more than 1% of the $55 billion
long-distance market. MCI, with 1989 revenue of $6.47
billion, has about 12% of the market.

   "This is going to prove to be a powerful combination,"
said Lap Lee, a telecommunications analyst for Gordon Capital
Inc. Telecom, he said, adds not only new customers but also
several important products, including voice messaging and
other enhanced services, that MCI can sell to its existing
customers and use to attract new business.
   With Telecom, MCI will pick up about 450,000 business
customers in smaller cities in the South and Midwest. Among
its innovative products is its credit card, which allows
users to check stock quotes over the phone and set up
conference calls. "This strategic alliance and critical mass
we pick up will be important as we look to competition over
the next few years," MCI President Bert Roberts said in an
interview.
   Mr. Roberts said the acquisition of Telecom will dilute
MCI earnings up to 5% in the first year, but will add to
earnings after that. "By the second year, we will have
totally turned the corner," he said.
   The company is financing the acquisition with bank loans,
but a spokeswoman said details weren't available. She also
said the companies are working on a plan to mesh their
management teams.
   The proposed merger sent shares of Telecom soaring and
shaved MCI's price by $1.125. In New York Stock Exchange
Composite trading, Telecom closed at $38.125, up $16.25. In
over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at $35.75.
   O. Gene Gabbard, chairman and chief executive officer of
Telecom, said the merger announcement is the next step in the
industry's consolidation. "We've seen some 1,000 companies
shrink down to about 200 since 1982," he said. "Now, we will
begin to see even fewer -- but stronger -- entrants in the
marketplace."
   Indeed, some analysts said the merger could accelerate the
three-year industry consolidation -- a result of greater
regulatory freedom for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. "If
you're going to compete against AT&amp;T, the bigger you are, the
better you are," said Jack Grubman, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. With the Federal Communications Commission
preparing to further loosen regulatory reins on AT&amp;T, Mr.
Grubman said, "the competition is going to get tougher, and
the MCI-Telecom USA announcement begs the question: Who's
next?"
   The stock market seemed to answer that. The news pushed up
shares of some smaller carriers, including Advanced
Telecommunications Corp., which was up $3.25 to $16.75, and
Rochester Telephone, which has a long-distance division, up
$1.125 to $36.875. Analysts also said possible targets for
acquisition are Williams Cos., a gas company that has
threaded fiber-optic cable through abandoned pipeline;
Telesphere International, of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., and
International Telecharge Inc. of Dallas.
   Jim Smith, president of the Competitive Telecommunications
Association, a trade group representing 120 regional
long-distance carriers, said the proposed merger "may bode
ill for the future of competition in the long-distance
industry and for the American public." Mr. Smith warned that
consolidation "could accelerate to the point of oligopoly,"
leaving customers with little price competition and little
innovation.
   In recent years, MCI's strategy has been to shape the
company's business to more closely mirror AT&amp;T's. It started
with a push into the big-business segment, then with
increased emphasis on the international and residential
segments and now with a merger that gives it a solid block of
medium-sized business customers.
   "There's a market-share war going on," said Joel Gross, an
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "It was a build
versus buy decision for MCI, and they decided it was cheaper
to buy Telecom USA rather than build up business in the
middle market."
   The MCI-Telecom merger must pass shareholder and
regulatory muster, and Mr. Roberts said he hoped to complete
the process by midsummer to late summer, but acknowledged the
process could take longer. The merger requires approval from
Telecom shareholders, the Justice Department under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act, the Federal Communications
Commission and from public utilities commissions in states
where both MCI and Telecom operate.
   An FCC spokeswoman indicated the approval process would
last at least six months but could take upward of a year.
   Mr. Roberts, who emphasized the friendliness of the merger
negotiations and the similarities in corporate cultures, said
he anticipated "no major displacement of people" as a result
of the merger. MCI employs 19,500 while Telecom employs
5,000. Both Telecom and MCI have reputations as
product-innovators and strong marketers. Analysts give both
companies very high marks for management and cost controls.
   Meantime, Standard &amp; Poor's placed MCIs
triple-B-plus-rated senior secured debt, triple-B
subordinated debt and single-A-2 commercial paper on its
credit watch list "with negative implications," pending
review of the merger. S&amp;P said it anticipates a "sharp
deterioration in the capital structure and significantly
higher fixed charges." Moody's Investor Service also placed
MCI (P) Baa-1 senior debt rating and Prime-2 rating for
commercial paper under review for a possible downgrade.
   Several analysts said they were surprised by the merger
announcement, largely because of Telecom's acquisitive
nature. "Quite frankly, we'd gotten used to Telecom playing
the role of the consolidator rather than the object of
consolidation," said W. Mark Dunkel, an analyst at
Robinson-Humphrey Co.
   Telecom, itself the product of a 1988 merger of
SouthernNet Inc., based in Atlanta, and Teleconnect Co. of
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has been on an acquisition binge. Before
the merger and after, the companies purchased about 30
concerns since 1985.
   Mr. Gabbard, and the rest of Telecom's officers and
directors, stand to benefit handsomely from the proposed MCI
acquisition, according to the company's latest proxy
statement. The officers and directors hold about 30% of
Telecom's common stock outstanding, which at $42 a share
translates into about $375 million going to that group.
   Analysts said Telecom USA holders benefited from a
shareholder-rights plan that allowed them to buy additional
shares at below-market prices in the event of an unwanted
takeover. "In hindsight, it looks like a wise move on {Mr.}
Gabbard's part," said Stephen J. Shook, an analyst at
Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. "It translated into one heck of
a price for Telecom shareholders."
   This year, Telecom stock has traded as low as $15.75 a
share, mainly because of an ill-fated proposal to acquire
troubled ALC Communications Corp. of Birmingham, Mich.
Telecom called off discussions with ALC less than a month
after announcing the deal.
