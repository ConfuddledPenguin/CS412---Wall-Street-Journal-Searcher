   HONG KONG -- Taking his parents' advice, Simon To obtained
a British passport in the days when it was still easy for
Hong Kong Chinese to do so. He then returned to this British
colony, safe in the knowledge that he could run his business
unimpeded by worries about his future.
   Or so he thought. The trouble is, everyone else now seems
to have the same idea. And the scramble for foreign passports
is making Mr. To's business life miserable.

   Mr. To, the 38-year-old managing director of Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd.'s China-trade division, says every one of his
managers has left or plans to leave. Though he believes that
local people can better handle China business, he is forced
to hire expensive expatriates to fill the openings.
   Emigration is nothing new for Hong Kong families, many of
whom -- including Mr. To's parents -- fled to the colony to
escape communist rule in China. The rate began rising sharply
in 1986, in the wake of the British-Chinese agreement for
China to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Just as
that flood appeared to be ebbing in 1989, Chinese troops
opened fire on their countrymen June 4.
   The bloody suppression of student-led demonstrations in
Beijing and doubts about the colony's future constitution are
widely viewed as having encouraged this year's expected
record number of departures from Hong Kong. The government
estimates that about 55,000 people will emigrate this year --
many of them trained professionals with marketable skills
abroad -- up from 42,000 in 1989.
   "June 4 and what has followed changed a lot of people's
views," says a banker. "All of the assumptions for the next
decade are gone."
   That is creating huge problems for this capitalist
colony's business sector.
   One example is Bank of East Asia Ltd. Last year, K.M.
Chan, the head of the bank's finance and investment
subsidiaries, resigned to go to Canada. Mr. Chan had groomed
a successor -- but he also quit, to take a more lucrative job
as a securities regulator. Mr. Chan's job ultimately went to
an accountant who had been with the bank for only three
years.
   Vacancies are being created as more people move from one
job to another in Hong Kong. Some people are changing jobs
for more money, others to increase their chances of obtaining
a foreign visa.
   Mignonne Cheng achieved both goals. After 18 years in Hong
Kong with Chase Manhattan Bank, where she was a middle-level
executive, Ms. Cheng left in February to join Banque
Nationale de Paris in Hong Kong. She received a substantial
raise, a guaranteed bonus and a promise of a French passport.
   "We can no longer count on replacing people within the
Hong Kong market," says the head of a multinational company's
local office. "And because people are talking to each other
about emigration instead of talking to the clients, there's a
loss of productivity."
   Managers are devoting more time to recruiting and internal
restructuring. The loss of experienced personnel is reducing
efficiency. And because wages are rising faster than profits,
many companies are seeing their profit margins shrink.
   "The brain drain and rising costs are forcing people to
reconsider whether they should be in Hong Kong," says Mark
Michelson, an executive at Business International
Asia/Pacific Ltd., a consultant to multinational companies.
"It doesn't mean a lot of companies are moving, but more are
thinking about it."
   To be sure, Hong Kong isn't the only Asian city facing a
shortage of skills; companies throughout the region are
complaining of how staffing problems are blocking expansion.
"There's a short supply of people wherever you go in Asia,"
says John Chua, managing director of Asia-Pacific operations
for U.S.-based software-maker ASK Computer Systems Inc.
"That's a reflection of the boom times out here." Still, the
problems facing Hong Kong's companies are unique.
   Because of the limited capacity of other countries to
accept Hong Kong residents, annual emigration probably never
will represent more than a fraction of Hong Kong's 5.7
million population. Even so, the flow of departures is
damaging because so many of the emigrants are skilled.
   "The work force of any economy is enhanced by the talent
of its managers," says Simon Murray, Hutchison Whampoa's
managing director and a member of Honour Hong Kong, a group
of businesses and professional organizations trying to
restore confidence in the colony. "If there's an erosion of
that talent, then there's an erosion of the product." A
recent study by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants says
that emigration could slow the growth of Hong Kong's economy
by as much as 45% by 1997.
   "Clearly, {emigration} figures are serious, and I would
not wish to pretend otherwise," says Donald Tsang, the
government's director of administration. "But they must be
put in perspective." Aside from the fact that other countries
limit immigration, Mr. Tsang says Britain's plan to offer the
right of abode to 50,000 skilled Hong Kong professionals and
their families will keep a brake on emigration.
   Many businessmen don't expect Britain's offer -- which
faces an uncertain future in Parliament -- to stabilize the
outflow. China says it won't recognize foreign passports as
protection for ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong. Nor are
businessmen consoled by the Hong Kong government's promise to
produce more university graduates to offset the brain drain.
   The business executives say there is little hope of
resolving the immediate consequences of rising emigration:
the loss of experienced personnel, an increasing number of
mistakes caused by their inexperienced replacements and lost
business opportunities because knowledgeable executives are
leaving. The situation is compounded by the prospect of years
of unstable management and falling profits resulting from the
need to raise wages and increase training.
