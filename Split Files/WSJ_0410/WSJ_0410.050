   PRINCETON, N.J. -- Allstate Insurance Co. filed a federal
lawsuit challenging New Jersey's recently enacted auto
insurance reform law. The suit says the law adopted in March
deprives Allstate of a reasonable return by forcing insurers
to cover part of $3 billion in losses incurred by the state's
high-risk insurance pool.
   The reform law lowers premiums by 20% and abolishes the
high-risk pool, known as the Joint Underwriters Association.
Three other companies, Continental Corp. of New York, Liberty
Mutual Insurance Group and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, have also
sued to block the reform plan.
