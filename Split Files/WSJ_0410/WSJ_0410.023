   Regarding your March 7 page-one article "Letter Bomb:
Postal Service Again Asks for Rate Increase as Automation
Lags," I was struck by the horrible mistake the nation made
back in 1845 when it got rid of the private mail companies.
In the 1840s, private mail companies were inventing mail
service in America. The government would not deliver letters
to and from the post office, so private carriers undertook to
do this for a penny for each letter. They innovated the use
of letter boxes so letters could be deposited conveniently
throughout the city. They started the use of postage stamps
so that you could prepay the postage of letters deposited in
a box. And they instituted three-times- and then
four-times-a-day delivery.
   Best of all, the private carriers, in competition with the
moribund post office of that day, cut the cost of mail
delivery between cities, in some cases to one-fifth of the
post-office rate. It was a vibrant time of progress in mail
service, which was ended only by Congress's giving the Postal
Service a monopoly.

   I couldn't help but think that a large contributing factor
behind the proposed rate increase is the frank; not
Postmaster General Anthony Frank, but the free mailing
privileges given to every member of Congress.
   By making congressmen pay for their mailings like everyone
else, the rate increase probably could be cut in half, and
simultaneously we would eliminate a large amount of junk
mail.
