   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange said it will drop a proposal
to fine brokerages that fail to settle securities trades
within two days of their execution, even after a proposed
automatic clearing and settlement system is put into place.
   Sir Q.W. Lee, the exchange's chairman, portrayed the
decision as a compromise intended to still more than a year
of debate over details of a settlement plan.

   "We've talked at length about this and we're very pleased
that it's been satisfactorily resolved," Sir Q.W. said.
   While the exchange's governing council embraced a two-day
settlement period in October, the plan drew criticism by
foreign brokerages that argued that three days were needed to
settle trades with overseas customers and would be in line
with international standards.
   In February, the exchange relented somewhat, saying that
it was considering postponing a system of penalties until
after the automatic system is in place, which is expected to
be in the second half of 1991. But, with major brokerages
still dissatisfied, the debate persisted.
   The two-day settlement system is to replace a 24-hour
settlement period that is routinely flouted without penalty.
