   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The cost of living in West
Germany rose 0.1% in the month to mid-March and 2.7% from
March 1989, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.
   The final statistics for the month compare with a 0.2%
increase reported in the preliminary data, released 11 days
ago. The year-to-year rate of 2.7% was unchanged from the
preliminary report.
