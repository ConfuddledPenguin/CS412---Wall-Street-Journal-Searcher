   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Del Webb Corp. agreed to some demands
made by a director and major shareholder in a move to avert a
proxy battle by the director at the company's annual meeting
May 16.
   The company said it agreed to renominate four of 10
directors whose terms were scheduled to expire, including
James J. Cotter, who planned the proxy fight. Mr. Cotter owns
9.8% of Del Webb's stock.

   In addition, Del Webb said it would expand the board by
two members. One of the new directors, whose identity hasn't
yet been disclosed, will be jointly nominated by Mr. Cotter
and the company.
   The second, nominated by the company, is Hugh Culverhouse
Jr., 42 years old, a senior partner in the Miami law firm of
Culverhouse &amp; Ross, who owns 72,000 of the real-estate
development concern's 9.4 million common shares outstanding.
   Mr. Cotter agreed to drop plans to offer a rival slate of
directors. In addition, he won't push to eliminate "golden
parachute" contracts held by senior management, Del Webb
said.
   A company spokesman said: "We didn't think it was
worthwhile to engage in an expensive proxy fight."
   Mr. Cotter had intended to propose a rival slate of three
directors, including himself. His term on the 10-member board
is set to expire at the annual meeting, and Del Webb had said
last month it wouldn't renominate him to the board.
   The agreement doesn't preclude Mr. Cotter, who couldn't be
reached to comment, from waging a proxy fight in the future.
Despite the agreement, Mr. Cotter, chairman of Craig Corp., a
Los Angeles supermarket chain and photographic-accessories
concern, intends to actively solicit proxies for his proposed
shareholder-rights plan at the annual meeting. Del Webb's
board adopted so-called poison-pill provisions last year.
