   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Exxon Corp. and its Exxon
Shipping Co. unit pleaded innocent to five-count criminal
indictments charging them with violating various federal laws
in the nation's worst oil spill a year ago.
   Exxon and Exxon Shipping entered their pleas in separate
arraignments before U.S. District Judge John E. Roberts late
yesterday afternoon.

   The two Feb. 27 indictments stem from the March 24, 1989,
spill of nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil
from the tanker Exxon Valdez, which ran aground and ripped
its bottom open on a charted reef outside shipping lanes in
Prince William Sound.
   The oil coated hundreds of miles of coastline and killed
countless fish, birds and other marine life.
   Justice Department officials have said the indictments
could result in penalties of $700 million or more.
   Exxon said it would vigorously defend itself against the
charges, which range from violating clean water and refuse
acts to negligently and unlawfully discharging oil into a
navigable waterway.
   More than 160 civil suits are pending against Exxon by the
state of Alaska, environmentalists and private individuals
for unspecified damages.
