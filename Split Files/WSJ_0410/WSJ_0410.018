   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Network Equipment Technologies
Inc., citing improprieties with certain orders and shipments,
said its fiscal fourth-quarter results will be worse than a
pessimistic projection it made just last week.
   Network, a communications network designer that until
recently had been considered among the hottest companies in
the industry, said it expects to report earnings per share of
10 cents for the quarter ended March 31, only about a third
of the 33 cents a share posted for the year-earlier period,
and far below analysts' estimates. The company also said
revenue would be $44 million compared with $38.8 million a
year ago, a substantially smaller increase than analysts had
been expecting.

   The disclosures pounded Network's stock, which plunged
$5.75 to close at $15.125 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock had been moving steadily higher
over the past year, rising from $18 a share in 1988 to a
recent high of $34.375 shortly before its reverses.
   The news was the second embarrassment in a matter of days
for Network and its high-profile chief executive officer,
Bruce D. Smith. On April 2, Network's stock plunged 21%
following the company's surprise prediction that quarterly
earnings would be lower than a year earlier.
   At the time, Network blamed a greater-than-expected
decline in sales through International Business Machines
Corp. and a failure to receive confirmation of certain
orders.
   Many analysts had dismissed the 21% stock tumble as an
overreaction, but nevertheless most cut their profit
estimates for the quarter to about 31 cents from 39 cents and
trimmed revenue projections to about $50 million from $56
million.
   But Network said a thorough review over the weekend turned
up "terms of sale" that didn't "conform to (company)
policies." Furthermore, Network said it is investigating
shipments made against an order that it described as "not
valid." It said the improprieties reduced both margins and
revenue, worsening the already depressed quarterly results.
   The company couldn't be reached to elaborate on the sales
irregularities or whether any fraud may have been involved.
However, securities analysts said Mr. Smith informed them in
a conference call yesterday that the problems were
"localized" and minimal and have been cleared up, in part by
shifting some personnel. One analyst, George P. Kelly of
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said he still believes that Network's
management is "the best in the business" and that the
company's prospects are still strong.
   The personnel shifts Mr. Smith mentioned to analysts may
have included Roger T. Hobbs, vice president of national
marketing, whom Network announced has resigned. The company
didn't say whether the resignation was related to the sales
problems and Mr. Hobbs couldn't be reached for comment. He
was succeeded by Craig Tysdal, formerly vice president of
product marketing.
   The troubles come at an awkward time for Network and Mr.
Smith. Mr. Smith has embarked on an ambitious, costly plan to
develop a global network computer system that will have the
capability to manipulate data much more extensively than
current systems. Meanwhile, the company's core business of
producing standard networks is slowing, mainly because of the
reduced sales through IBM. Network has estimated that
developing the new network software will eat up about half
its research and development budget in coming years.
   Moreover, Network is likely to face competition from some
of the biggest companies in computing, including Hewlett
Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp.
