   LOS ANGELES -- Medco Research Inc. said it asked its
investment banker, Oppenheimer &amp; Co., to explore the
possibility of selling the company.
   Medco, a drug company that develops treatments and
diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases, said that "there is no
assurance" that the company will commence negotiations or
that a sale of the company can be completed.

   Medco disclosed in November that it retained Oppenheimer
to consider alternatives to "maximize shareholder value" but
hadn't said that these might include selling the company,
said William C. Govier, director of research and medical
affairs.
   Medco issued a news release yesterday to announce the
possible sale and other corporate news after hearing from
market sources that false reports were spreading about the
company, Dr. Govier said. "We were hearing rumors running
around and thought we'd better put out the facts."
   The National Association of Securities Dealers halted
quotes on Medco stock yesterday pending the company's
release. Medco shares resumed trading and finished the day at
$14.375, off 50 cents.
   Medco also said it earned about $224,000 in royalty income
from December through March from U.S. sales of a new drug,
Adenocard. "These are the company's first actual
product-related earnings," Dr. Govier said. Under a patent
agreement, Medco must pay 50% of the royalty income to the
University of Virginia Alumni Patents Foundation.
   Late last year, Adenocard was approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for use in the diagnosis of coronary
artery disease. Medco has licensed Adenocard to Lyphomed
Inc., a unit of Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., for sale in the
U.S. and Canada.
