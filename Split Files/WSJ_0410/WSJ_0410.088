   Tokyo share prices soared nearly 4% in heavy trading and
the yen strengthened amid conflicting Japanese news reports
suggesting Group of Seven countries would seek to bolster the
yen.
   The Nikkei index, an average of 225 key issues, climbed
1119.15 points, or 3.8%, finishing at 30397.93. It was the
index's fourth-biggest point gain ever, and extended Friday's
1029.72-point advance. Even though analysts expect the market
to turn lower again soon, droves of buyers were in the
market. An estimated 800 million shares were traded, off
slightly from 838.6 million shares Friday.

   At midmorning Tuesday, the Nikkei average was down about
557 points, to 29,840.
   Stockbrokers said the main impetus of Monday's rally was a
sharp increase in the yen after some national newspapers here
reported that finance ministers from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries had agreed at a meeting Saturday in
Paris to support the currency.
   That interpretation of events, implicitly ascribed by the
newspapers to sources in the country's Finance Ministry,
doesn't jibe with accounts in other Japanese papers or the
U.S. and European press. Those stories, quoting a communique
from the Group of Seven promising to keep the yen's steep
decline this year "under review," indicated that the
countries weren't in accord on a plan of action to stop the
yen's depreciation.
   Some analysts warned that Tokyo's obvious difference of
views with the group's other countries threatens to undermine
the credibility of Japanese financial policy makers. Already,
they have been frustrated in attempts to stem the yen's
decline, either by talking the currency lower, or by raising
interest rates and intervening in the currency market.
   Most market participants in Tokyo hewed to the optimistic
Japanese interpretation. Early dollar selling, spurred on by
light intervention by the Bank of Japan, was enough to drive
the dollar as low as 155.60 yen yesterday morning. In the
afternoon, the currency came back a bit to close at 156.45,
off from 157.70 late Friday in New York.
   "Our reading of the G-7 communique is that it's relatively
weak and noncommittal," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an
economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.'s office here. "The bottom
line is that the G-7 statement didn't promise" what the yen
needs to recover -- either coordinated interest-rate
increases in the seven countries or orchestrated yen-buying
by central banks other than the Bank of Japan.
   Indeed, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto undercut those
hopes further when he pledged over the weekend to avert
further interest-rate increases in Japan. "That just invites
further speculative attacks on the yen," Mr. Schoenholtz
said.
   For the time being, stockbrokers see the yen's
appreciation as an opportunity to sell unwanted stocks. "As
long as people are willing to buy stock, we are willing to
sell," one U.S. broker in Tokyo said.
   Many market players expect that kind of profit-taking
eventually to bring a halt to the market's recovery. "It's a
mere rebound" from the market's dramatic decline of 27% from
the start of the year through last Thursday, said Katsumi
Nishikido, a senior analyst at Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru
Securities Co. He predicts that buying will turn to selling
again as the index approaches the 31000-point level.
   Others said the yen's direction could set the market tone,
and might carry the market below the 30000-point mark again.
Hironobu Hagio, a fund manager at Nippon Life Insurance Co.,
the single biggest investor in the Tokyo market, said the
market's direction will depend heavily on the exchange rate.
   Investors' attention to earnings outlooks pushed up
high-tech shares such as Sony, which advanced 250 yen to
8,650 yen ($55.10). Hitachi was up 40 yen to 1,710.
   Also sharply higher were mining and construction shares
such as Dowa Mining, which gained 100 yen to 850 yen and
Kajima, which increased 50 yen to 1,700.
   Some domestic demand-related shares such as railways and
real estate companies were among Monday's outstanding
winners. Keisei gained 190 yen to 1,740 yen, and Heiwa Real
Estate gained 120 yen to 1,530.
   Steel shares were actively traded throughout the day. They
failed to sustain their morning gains, however, under strong
selling pressure in the afternoon. Nippon Steel was down 10
yen at 575 yen, while Sumitomo Metal gained 21 yen to 586.
   West German share prices tumbled 1.2% in nervous trading
in Frankfurt, as fears about an apparent rift between the
central bank and government over East German monetary union
frightened investors and triggered a wave of profit-taking.
   The German Stock Index plunged 23.98 points to 1923.86,
its lowest level since March 22.
   Comments last week and over the weekend by Bundesbank
officials that indicate the central bank will push interest
rates up if the government tries to introduce an even
exchange for all East German marks in savings has shaken the
market, traders said. To minimize the inflationary impact of
the currency conversion, the Bundesbank has suggested a limit
of 2,000 marks per person at the 1-for-1 rate and a 2-for-1
conversion rate above that level.
   Shares of Daimler-Benz dropped 19 marks ($11.20) to 936
marks ($552.20), leading the market lower. Traders said the
decline was triggered by diminishing expectations that
Mitsubishi of Japan is preparing to buy a large stake.
   Daimler had gained strongly late last week on rumors that
Deutsche Bank was planning to sell 10% of its 28% stake in
Daimler to Mitsubishi and speculation that the Japanese
company would seek to expand that stake through market
purchases.
   Volkswagen AG slid 9.50 marks to 601.50 marks, Bayerische
Motoren Werke dropped six marks to 604 and Porsche dropped 25
marks to 1120.
   Machinery-maker shares tumbled, as Linde fell 22 marks to
985, MAN lost 20 marks to 500 marks and
Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz dropped seven marks to 279.
   London shares closed modestly firmer amid light volume, as
a number of factors contributed to sluggish trading and
allowed the market to drift lazily upward, traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
6.6 points higher at 2227.7. The key index settled just off
its intraday high of 2227.9, which it posted in the first
hour of trading. The session's low was 2218.8.
   The narrower 30-share index was up 2.1 points at 1742.3.
Volume was a thin 304.6 million shares, compared with 578.6
million shares Friday.
   Dealers noted an absence of fresh features in the day's
trading, although a number of ex-dividend stocks provided
some movement.
   Among companies which went ex-dividend: brewing and
distilling concern Guinness lost 16 pence to close at 653
pence ($3.98) a share; Prudential, the insurance and
financial services company, shed six pence to 199; General
Accident, another insurer, plunged 44 to #10.19 ($6.20) and
Reckitt &amp; Colman, the diversified manufacturer, slid 19 pence
to #11.50.
   Elsewhere, financial services and tobacco conglomerate
B.A.T Industries gained 12 pence to 755 on anticipation
California state insurance regulators may support Sir James
Goldsmith's plans to sell off B.A.T's U.S. insurance assets
once he gains control of the company. A decision by
California regulators was expected late yesterday.
   In other European markets, Paris shares posted their third
consecutive record close. Amsterdam shares closed mostly
lower and were narrowly mixed in Brussels. Stockholm edged
higher, Milan ended mostly higher and Zurich finished easier.
   In other Asian and Pacific markets, shares were higher in
Wellington and lower in Seoul. Manila's stock market was
closed.
