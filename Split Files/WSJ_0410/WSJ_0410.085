   Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank said it agreed with Jay Dickson
Brown &amp; Co. to form a joint venture for making markets in
swaps, options and other financial transactions.
   The venture will have initial capital of $2.3 million,
two-thirds of which will be provided by the Japanese bank and
the rest by Jay Dickson Brown, a closely held
financial-services concern. Its total net worth, however,
will be $20 million, a Mitsui spokesman said. The venture, to
be based in New York, plans to open offices in Tokyo and
London.

   Swaps are financial and currency transactions in which,
for example, fixed-rate claims and liabilities are exchanged
for floating-rate claims and liabilities. Option trading is
trading in the right to conduct a financial transaction.
Options and swaps are both designed to avert risks related to
fluctuations in interest or foreign-exchange rates.
