   The two sides in the computer industry's war over the Unix
operating system said they have broken off talks on merging
their groups and have agreed to go their separate ways.
   That represents at least something of a setback for
proponents of Unix, because customers may get confused about
which version of Unix to use and delay any purchases. In
addition, corporate customers will find it inconvenient to
have to deal with two flavors of Unix rather than one --
they're already having enough trouble juggling all the
operating systems, types of hardware and application software
packages on the market.

   Any trouble could be important, because as Unix has built
momentum over the past couple of years, it has helped change
the rules of the computer marketplace. Unix runs on most
types of computer hardware, so customers who use it aren't
locked in to using one company's hardware, as customers
generally have been in the past. That has given customers new
flexibility; it has also helped drive profit margins on
hardware way down.
   The one drawback for Unix has been that most versions were
slightly different, so programs for one type of hardware
needed to be fiddled with before they could run on another
type. And anything that prolongs that difficulty is a
problem.
   At the same time, the end of truce talks was hardly a
surprise. The Open Software Foundation -- an industry group
that includes International Business Machines Corp. and
Digital Equipment Corp. -- and Unix International -- which
includes American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Sun
Microsystems Inc. -- had been sparring for the past two
years.
   It had become increasingly clear in recent months that
they were unlikely to unite. Some of the companies involved
argued, in fact, that the announcement will help sellers of
Unix-based systems because it will finally get customers to
stop focusing on the two sides' on-again-off-again
negotiations.
   "Now that this whole thing is behind us, maybe we can
focus on the real issues," said Scott McNealy, chief
executive officer of Sun Microsystems, a maker of
workstations that has been one of the major figures in the
Unix wars. He said that it was "absolutely fanciful thinking
that we'd ever get down to one of anything," and that the
real competition is Unix against other operating systems, not
one version of Unix against another.
   The Open Software Foundation said talks broke off partly
because Unix International and AT&amp;T's Unix development arm
refused to turn control of Unix over to the industry. The
Open Software Foundation had been formed largely because of
concern that AT&amp;T, the originator of Unix, and its ally Sun
had too much control over the Unix marketplace because they
controlled the development of the basic Unix software.
   OSF also said it decided that its version, to be finished
late this year, was clearly superior to the latest AT&amp;T
version on the market. That is especially true, OSF said, in
terms of the system's security and its ability to run on
hardware with more than one central processor.
   Unix International said talks broke off because OSF was
pulled in too many different directions by its numerous
members. Unix International also disputed the idea that there
was much difference in the technology, saying it would be
able to deliver at about the same time as OSF the features
that OSF claimed as advantages.
   Both sides were quick to claim victory. Unix International
members argued that they have built up too much momentum to
be overtaken, because they already have their next-generation
version of Unix in the marketplace, while OSF has run into
delays. OSF members noted their impressive membership list,
whose importance was underscored yesterday when several
announced that they were increasing their financing of OSF to
ensure its success.
   Whether one will gain a significant advantage probably
won't be clear until after OSF members start selling systems
based on its version of Unix, a year from now. But other
computer-industry fights like this have ended in draws
lately, and it seems likely that this one will, too.
