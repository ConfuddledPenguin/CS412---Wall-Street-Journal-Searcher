   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued American
Airlines Inc., charging that the company's weight-standard
policy discriminates against women over the age of 40.
   The class-action suit against the AMR Corp. unit was filed
in federal court in Los Angeles by the EEOC's office there.
The plaintiffs are Patt Gibbs, Sherri Cappello and Linda
Prosser, all members of the Association of Professional
Flight Attendants. The suit, which covers all women over the
age of 40 who have been hurt by the company's policy, calls
for reimbursement of lost earnings as well as the elimination
of a weight standard for all employees.

   Tommie Huttow-Blake, a member of the weight-issue task
force for the flight attendants union, said elimination of
the standard would benefit not only women over 40, who, she
said, require greater body weight to maintain necessary
minerals and protein, but flight attendants who want to
return from maternity leave.
   Flight attendants who take time off to have children are
placed on disability for six weeks and must lose the excess
weight in that time or are suspended without pay and health
care, said Ms. Huttow-Blake.
   American Airlines is the only major airline with an
inflexible weight policy, said Ralph Fertig, supervisory
trial attorney of the EEOC's Los Angeles office. American's
standard sets weight-to-height ratios 17.5% below the
standards in the 1959 Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. tables
on average adult ratios.
   "The idea they can't weigh more than a certain amount is
ridiculous," said Mr. Fertig. He added that the company's
policy is "a very humiliating and discriminatory policy."
   According to American's weight policy, "a firm, trim
silhouette, free of bulges, rolls or paunches, is necessary
for an alert, efficient image."
   Under a 1977 court settlement, the American Airlines
Flight Attendant Weight Program was established. This program
prohibited the company from arbitrarily weighing its flight
attendants. However, it allowed the company to give only one
deadline date to lose extra weight for employees who wanted
to return from leave. Active flight attendants are given
three chances to lose weight.
   Ms. Huttow-Blake, who has been a flight attendant for 20
years, said, "We're talking about women in a size 10 losing
their jobs."
   This is the third suit pending against American Airlines
related to its weight standard. The two other cases, filed by
the flight attendants union, are in federal courts in New
York and Texas.
   "The company tries to say it's a bona fide occupational
qualification," said Ms. Huttow-Blake. "But that's baloney.
These appearance standards have nothing to do with
proficiency."
   American Airlines officials in Fort Worth declined to
comment, saying they hadn't seen the lawsuit yet.
