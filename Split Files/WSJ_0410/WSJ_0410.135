   NEW YORK -- Bond prices fell moderately as dealers braced
for a potential selloff, which they said might occur if the
government's 40-year bond auction flops again.
   The $3.5 billion of so-called "bailout bonds" will be sold
today by the Resolution Funding Corp., a federal agency
created to finance the rescue of the nation's troubled thrift
industry.

   In trading yesterday, the benchmark 30-year bond fell
nearly 3/8 point, or $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount, while the yield rose to 8.54% from 8.51% on Friday.
Municipal, investment-grade corporate and mortgage-backed
bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/4 point lower. Junk
bonds ended mixed.
   Traders said bond prices began to erode during overnight
trading in Tokyo, due to a weaker dollar. The selling
continued when trading began in the U.S.
   But when the dollar rebounded later in the day, bond
prices remained depressed due in part to rumors that few
large bond dealers purchased "put" options in the futures
market.
   F. Ward McCarthy Jr., a managing director at Stone &amp;
McCarthy Research Associates, said dealers used the puts to
hedge their investment positions because they feared that
today's Refcorp auction will lead to a bond market rout. The
effect of the puts may have been exaggerated because of the
market's extremely thin trading conditions, said Mr.
McCarthy.
   A put option contract grants the buyer the right to sell a
bond in the future at a pre-determined price. The buyer of
the put essentially is betting that bond prices will fall and
that he or she can profit on the difference between the
current market price and the pre-determined contract price.
   Although many dealers say they expect the 40-year bond
sale to go smoothly, they nevertheless are hedging their
bets.
   Dealers have good reasons to hedge their bets. The
previous 40-year bond auction in January, which marked the
first time that the government sold bonds with a 40-year
maturity since the 1950s, was a disaster. After details of
the auction were announced, bond prices fell sharply and the
new bonds immediately lost value. Many dealers had to sell
the bonds at a discount.
   Traders are divided about the prospects for the Refcorp
auction.
   Some say that the size of the auction will be a plus.
Helping the sale go smoothly, they said, is the Treasury's
decision to offer $3.5 billion of the 40-year bonds, rather
than the $5 billion sold at the agency's previous sale.
   Others, however, are concerned that investors and dealers
will shy away from the auction because Refcorp flopped at its
first attempt to sell 40-year bonds.
   Moreover, they say, investors aren't comfortable with the
securities because they are being sold by a relatively new
and untried government agency that is associated with the
troubled thrift industry.
   "It's the new kid on the block and last time it had a
terrible disease," said a government bond trader. "People are
afraid of it."
   Another dealer concurred: "A lot of people got decimated
by the first 40-year bond auction and they're not playing
this time."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices ended lower ahead of the Resolution Funding
Corp.'s $3.5 billion auction of 40-year bonds.
   In when-issued trading, the 40-year bonds were quoted at a
yield of 8.86%, nearly 1/3 percentage point higher than the
yield on the benchmark 30-year bond.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at about 99 11/32
compared with 99 23/32 on Friday. The latest 10-year notes
ended at 99 10/32 to yield 8.58% compared with 99 19/32 to
yield 8.54% on Friday.
   Short-term rates rose after the government sold Treasury
bills at yesterday's regular weekly auction, although the
rates at the auction were lower than at last week's auction.
   The average discount rate on new threemonth and new
six-month bills was 7.80%. That rate was down from last
week's auction, when the rate on three-month bills was 7.83%
and the rate on six-month bills was 7.81%.
   The Treasury will sell $7.5 billion of seven-year notes
tomorrow. In when-issued trading activity, the notes were
quoted at a yield of 8.62%, up from 8.59% Friday.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated April 12. The 13-week bills mature
July 12, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Oct. 11, 1990.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Jack Eckerd Corp. made a partial
comeback yesterday after plunging more than seven points
Friday on rumors that the company plans to acquire some Revco
D.S. Inc. stores.
   Michael Zagorac, an Eckerd spokesman, confirmed that
Eckerd has been "evaluating" information relating to Revco's
sale of 712 drugstores. He said that Eckerd "may be
interested in some stores in some markets," but added that no
purchase decisions have yet been made.
   Mr. Zagorac also confirmed that Eckerd is seeking to
privately place a $100 million senior unsecured debt issue.
He would not comment on whether the debt issue will be senior
to the outstanding Eckerd junk bonds. Fears that the debt
issue would be senior in the capital structure to existing
Eckerd issues also helped depress the company's bonds Friday.
   Eckerd's zero-coupon securities rose three points to
finish at 68 after plummeting 7 1/2 points Friday. Meanwhile,
the company's 11 1/8% subordinated debentures, maturing in
2001, closed two points higher.
   The junk bonds of General Development Corp. advanced
despite news that the Miami-based developer filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   General Development's 12 5/8% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2005, added 1 1/2 points to finish at 14 in thin
trading. The company's 12 7/8% senior subordinated notes, due
in 1995, chalked up 1 to end at 23 3/4 in light volume on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Both issues are now trading "flat," or without accrued
interest. Dealers said the company's bonds have been trading
at distressed levels for weeks and that a bankruptcy-law
filing had been widely expected.
   In the broader market, junk bonds or speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at
all, finished mixed in listless trading, while in the
investment-grade market, corporate issues ended unchanged to
1/4 point lower.

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Actively traded municipal bonds finished flat to 1/4 point
lower in listless trading, softening in tandem with the
weaker Treasury bond market.
   But even though municipals gave a lackluster performance,
some traders didn't read a lot into the activity,
particularly with the market in low gear for the
holiday-shortened week.
   Trading "never really got going," said a New York trader,
adding that there was little interest in two sizable New York
issues that were freed to trade during the session.
   He was referring to the New York Housing Finance Agency's
$552.8 million revenue refunding and special obligation
bonds, priced by a J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. group, and the
Triborough Bridge &amp; Tunnel Authority's $167.7 million general
purpose revenue bonds, Series R, priced by a Dillon Read &amp;
Co. group.
   Traders also are awaiting today's pricing of California's
$500 million various purpose general obligation bonds.
   In secondary trading, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds due in 2018 finished 1/8 lower at 97 3/8,
yielding 7.40%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended 5/32 to 7/32 lower in light
trading.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9% securities
for April delivery ended at 96, down 6/32, the 9 1/2%
securities at 98 11/32, down 7/32, and the 10% securities at
100 21/32, down 5/32. Federal National Mortgage Association's
9 1/2% issue was quoted at 98 18/32, down 6/32.
   In the derivative market, Fannie Mae issued a $300 million
real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic, backed by
its 10 1/2% securities through Nomura Securities
International Inc.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds ended moderately lower after
London reported a larger-than-anticipated 0.7% rise in
manufacturers' prices during March.
   In response, Britain's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell
11/32 from Friday to 98 5/8 to yield 11.93%.
   In Japan, government bonds were stronger reflecting a rise
in the yen. The dollar ended at 156.50 yen, down from 157.70
yen in New York late Friday and from 157.47 yen at Tokyo's
close Friday.
   At the Tokyo Stock Exchange close, the benchmark No. 119
yen bond was up 0.45 point to 86.81. The yield fell to
7.185%.
   West German bonds extended Friday's losses. Prices tumbled
late Friday as the debate between politicians and central
bankers over the conversion rate for East German marks heated
up again. Although no new information was released yesterday,
traders said the market continued to react to Friday's news.
   Bonn's 7 3/4% bond due in 2000 fell 0.40 point to 94.20 to
yield 8.64%.
