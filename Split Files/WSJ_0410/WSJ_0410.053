   MOSCOW -- The Soviet government expects powerful public
opposition to its plans to switch to a market economy. But
Leonid Abalkin, deputy prime minister in charge of economic
reform, says "there is no alternative" if the U.S.S.R. is to
remain a major world power.
   At a news conference, Mr. Abalkin confirmed that the
government will soon present a package of measures that
includes a sweeping reform of prices, selling off state
industries and revamping the nation's banking system. He also
said the government may buy consumer goods in the West to
ease the pain caused by the measures, but ruled out any quick
moves to make the Soviet currency, the ruble, convertible.

   The Soviet leadership is expected to announce details of
the package this month, and officials have been issuing
warnings about painful and unpopular measures. Some labor
leaders already say the plans won't be acceptable to the
population, which is accustomed to guaranteed employment and
heavily subsidized food and consumer goods.
   Alexei Sergeyev, an economics professor at the Labor
Unions' Higher School, said the government package may
include a two-year ban on strikes to head off potential
social unrest.
   Mr. Abalkin said the government has already taken the
"strategic decision" to switch to what he termed a regulated
market economy. "The working population will probably resent
it, as will much of the "apparat" (bureaucracy)," he
acknowledged. "But there's no avoiding the opposition, we'll
simply have to face it."
   He stressed that the package will differ considerably from
the economic "shock therapy" adopted by Poland early this
year. The Soviet measures will try to cushion the blows by
tying social benefits to inflation, protecting low-income
citizens and reforming prices in stages, not all at once. "We
want to raise prices but not kill the consumer," Mr. Abalkin
said. "We don't want to bring him to his knees."
   Although he didn't give details, many of the measures he
outlined are similar to ones he proposed last fall. At the
time, his advice was largely ignored by the Soviet government
of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who opted for a much more
cautious economic program that relied heavily on continued
central planning.
   But Mr. Abalkin said the government now accepted the need
to break clearly with the planned economy and move rapidly
toward a market system. "It is impossible to set up an
efficient economy without using market mechanisms," he said.
"Balancing on two stools is impossible."
