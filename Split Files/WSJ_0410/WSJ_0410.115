   NEW YORK -- Fitch Investors Service, which has been
struggling to become a power in the credit-rating business,
stunned traders with a downgrade of securities backed by the
credit cards issued by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
   The downgrade startled the market because Sears is
considered one of the premier issuers in the $30 billion
credit-card securities market. The move marks the first time
a credit-card issue has been downgraded.

   Fitch lowered its ratings on two Sears issues, Sears
Credit Account Trust Certificates 1988-C and 1989-A, to
double-A from triple-A. The action reflected Fitch's
downgrade of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. to single-A from
double-A-minus, and concerns about the structure of the
credit-card deals.
   But the two credit rating giants, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
and Moody's Investors Service Inc., affirmed the triple-A
ratings on the more than $5 billion of Sears credit-card
deals. Duff &amp; Phelps also maintains a triple-A rating on the
Sears issues.
   Some dealers said the Fitch downgrade hasn't yet had much
impact on the market, in part because the agency still
doesn't carry as much clout as its larger rivals.
   But the downgrade does raise question about the
"bullet-proof" status of some asset-backed securities
offerings. Fitch said one reason for its move was uncertainty
about whether asset-backed securities investors would be
fully protected if Sears Roebuck were ever forced into
bankruptcy proceedings.
