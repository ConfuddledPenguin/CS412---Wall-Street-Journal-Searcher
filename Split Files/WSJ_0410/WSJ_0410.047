   From a speech by Paul H. Nitze on the occasion of the
inauguration of the new building of the Council on Foreign
Relations in Washington, March 12:

<TEXT>
   For the Council on Foreign Relations to have its own
quarters here in Washington reflects a changed era. In the
'20s and '30s, New York was not only the financial,
industrial and press capital of the country, but prided
itself on being its policy center as well. The State
Department and White House might conduct diplomacy in peace
and raise and command armies in war, but policy was made by
serious people, men with a longer view, i.e. the great men of
finance and their advisers. New York was where they were to
be found. . . . In the postwar years the Council has
continued to represent an invaluable way for many of us
Washingtonians to tap the intellectual resources of the
enormously important New York business and intellectual
community. But the centrality of Washington to the
relationship has increased.
