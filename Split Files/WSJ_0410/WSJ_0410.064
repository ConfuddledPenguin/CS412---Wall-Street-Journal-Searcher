   MANAMA, Bahrain -- Crude oil production by the 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries totaled
24,090,000 barrels a day in March, up from 23,620,000 barrels
daily in February, according to estimates published by the
Cyprus-based oil industry newsletter Middle East Economic
Survey.
   The newsletter said the March output is marginally higher
than last year's monthly peak of 24 million barrels a day,
recorded in December, and represents the highest monthly OPEC
production since 1981.
