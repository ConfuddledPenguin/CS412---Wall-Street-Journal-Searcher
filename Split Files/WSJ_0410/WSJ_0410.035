   On an exotic location shoot in Kenya, stars Isabella
Rossellini, John Lithgow and James Earl Jones recently
finished filming a made-for-TV movie with the working title
"The Last Elephant," billed as an action-adventure drama
about one man's crusade to stop poachers from slaughtering
elephants for their ivory tusks.
   It has romance, violence and intrigue, but this isn't your
average Hollywood production. It's a movie with a message.
The first feature film produced by the National Audubon
Society -- with $4 million provided by Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. -- the movie aims to get viewers riled up enough
"to make a personal commitment to elephant protection," says
Christopher Palmer, president and executive producer of
National Audubon Society Productions. Following the film's
premiere this fall on TBS, Ms. Rossellini will make an appeal
to viewers to call a toll-free number for information on how
to fight poaching.

   With Earth Day around the corner and the environment high
on the list of fashionable causes in Hollywood, Audubon's Mr.
Palmer is on a hot streak. A 42-year-old former Environmental
Protection Agency official, he is trying to revamp the
Audubon Society's image as a genteel bird watcher's group by
producing high-profile programming aimed at a general
audience.
   With a patchwork of financing from corporate backers such
as Turner and General Electric Co., institutions, and
individuals, Mr. Palmer has put together an impressive lineup
of projects. In addition to TV specials and feature films
that will appear on Turner's TBS and TNT networks and the
Public Broadcasting Service, Audubon is producing
environmentally oriented music videos featuring rock stars
such as the Grateful Dead. On the high-tech front, Mr. Palmer
has lined up joint ventures with companies such as Apple
Computer Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd. and Dutch electronics giant
N.V. Philips, which are helping to fund projects that include
interactive video-disk systems for schools and institutions,
and computer software and games.
   In many of its projects, Audubon is going for the glitz,
recruiting movie stars to narrate documentaries for free and
luring rock icons to make music videos gratis for their
favorite causes. Mr. Palmer wants to make more films like
"The Last Elephant," using fictional stories to tackle
important environmental issues. While it isn't clear whether
these projects will galvanize substantial numbers of viewers
into action, Mr. Palmer defends his strategy. "We have to
reach new audiences that don't read as many books and
newspapers or watch documentaries," he says. "They do watch
music videos and movies -- and we have to deal with the world
as it is."
   Audubon isn't making fluff. While groups such as National
Geographic Society have long provided TV viewers with
high-brow nature programs and environmentally oriented
specials, Audubon has tackled controversial issues -- and
locked horns with powerful commercial interests in the
process. Last year, in a much-publicized brouhaha, eight
advertisers including Citicorp, Ford Motor Co. and Exxon
Corp. pulled about $250,000 of ads from TBS for Audubon's
"Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees" under pressure from the
logging industry. The program was critical of loggers in the
Northwest's older forests.
   Stroh Brewery Co., an advertiser and the primary
underwriter of Audubon specials, also withdrew its funding --
partly because of a threat from loggers to boycott its
products and partly because the company was in the middle of
takeover talks and under severe financial pressure. TBS
agreed to run the special without commercials, and also
agreed to provide Audubon with interim funding for the
specials until it could line up a new sponsor.
   Last month, after a six-month search, Mr. Palmer got a $3
million commitment from General Electric, already a big
supporter of Audubon's classroom projects. The grant will
fund eight hour-long specials, and GE will also buy
commercial time when the specials appear on TBS. GE says
Audubon will have complete editorial control over the
specials. Though GE and Audubon differ on such issues as
commercial nuclear power -- GE is in the business, which
Audubon opposes -- a GE spokeswoman says the two "don't have
to agree on everything."
   Turner, whose chairman, Ted Turner, is a big booster of
environmental causes, also has agreed to provide a chunk of
the programming budget for specials and feature films. "We
encourage Audubon to take a strong point of view," says Jerry
Hogan, president of Turner Entertainment Networks.
   Though the programs aren't profitable for the company,
"they add to the character and personality of TBS," Mr. Hogan
says. Indeed, TBS has drawn high ratings for Audubon programs
narrated by such Hollywood stars as Michael Douglas and
Robert Redford. Meryl Streep is narrating next month's
special on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and "Cheers"
star Ted Danson will host a coastal-pollution special
scheduled for October.
   Audubon uses the specials to get viewers involved. Last
month, TBS set up a toll-free "dolphin hot line" through
Western Union for viewers of "If Dolphins Could Talk," about
the mammals' plight with tuna fishermen and pollution
narrated by Michael Douglas. Callers were able to order a
free activist kit and send protest messages to the tuna
industry via a Western Union mailgram for a small fee.
Western Union said the volume of calls it received in the
two-hour period following the show was one of the highest in
the company's history.
   Getting the feature film on elephant poaching produced was
a tougher sell for Mr. Palmer. Several Hollywood studios
rejected the idea before Turner's new TNT cable network
bought it, providing money to hire screenwriters and a
well-known Hollywood producer, Robert Halmi. Turner's Mr.
Hogan says the company is considering releasing the film to
theaters overseas. "The movie is an example of Chris's
entrepreneurial spirit -- coming up with a dramatic movie
that appeals to the viewer as entertainment," he says.
   Mr. Palmer, who was born in Hong Kong and raised in
England, was trained as an engineer and served in Britain's
Royal Navy. A dual citizen of Britain and the U.S., he worked
as an energy adviser for Sen. Charles Percy, then joined the
Carter administration as chief of staff to the EPA's deputy
administrator. He joined Audubon in 1980 as director of
energy and environment, starting the society's television
department in 1984. There, he says, he realized Audubon could
use mass media and new technologies to vastly expand its
message beyond the hard core of about five million to nine
million people on the usual environmentalist mailing lists.
   To reach younger viewers, Audubon is trying to recruit
rock and country stars to make environmental music videos;
the first, featuring a new song by the Grateful Dead, will
make its debut next week. Claude Carmichael, a Wall Street
analyst with a recording background who volunteered to
produce the music videos, says artists can compose a song or
use original material Audubon is having written for the
videos, and draw on the society's extensive library of
documentary footage to accompany their music.
   Mr. Palmer is also promoting a range of educational
programs for schoolchildren and working closely with schools
to train teachers in the use of various Audubon-sponsored
materials. He raised $270,000 to start a computer software
series, Audubon Wildlife Adventures, featuring role-playing
stories about grizzly bears, sharks and whales. A
joint-venture with Lucasfilm and Apple Computer is developing
video-disk-based interactive science programs on
environmental issues. And with Philips, Audubon is producing
so-called CD-interactive products that combine digital audio
disks with visual elements and computer data.
   Audubon is also producing a series of print products,
including Audubon comic books, college textbooks, a series of
children's books that will be published by Bantam Books in
1992 and a companion novel for "The Last Elephant" movie.
John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. is publishing a series of "Audubon
Perspectives" books that will cover the society's
high-priority issues and include sections on what readers can
do to get involved.
