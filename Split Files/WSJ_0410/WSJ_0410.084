   DALLAS -- Greyhound Lines Inc. filed a $30 million federal
racketeering suit accusing Amalgamated Transit Union and
various union officials of trying to "extort wages and
benefits from Greyhound through violence, disruption of
interstate commerce and threats."
   The litigation came amid an escalating war of nerves
surrounding the bus company and its striking workers. As the
walkout by 9,300 Greyhound drivers, mechanics and clerks
entered its fifth week, the company refused to return to the
bargaining table until a week passes without violence.

   The suit was filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations law, which is being employed more
and more by companies with labor troubles.
   In a statement, union President James La Sala again
decried the violence surrounding the strike, referring to the
perpetrators as "common criminals." But Mr. La Sala also
condemned the company's charges against his union as
"outrageous" and said management was using the violence as "a
smokescreen to avoid its legal and moral responsibility to
negotiate in good faith."
   Greyhound filed its RICO suit in federal court in
Jacksonville, Fla., which was the site of a March 11 sniping
incident that injured seven Greyhound passengers. Since the
strike began March 2, more than 30 Greyhound buses and
terminals have been hit by gunfire, and the company has
received 80 bomb threats.
   The company previously obtained individual court orders
against union violence in 20 cities. But in an interview, P.
Anthony Lannie, Greyhound executive vice president and chief
labor negotiator, said that strategy has failed to stem the
violence. "Perhaps they will stop it if the court is imposing
liability on them for doing so," said Mr. Lannie, adding that
the company hopes to obtain a nationwide injunction through
the RICO suit.
   The court filing lists more than 100 incidents of alleged
violence, harassment and intimidation nationwide and contains
specific allegations of incidents in Florida and Alabama
involving alleged death threats and assaults aimed at
replacement drivers, intimidation of passengers and
destruction of company property. The suit also alleges that a
cartoon appeared on certain union bulletin boards depicting a
replacement driver being shot by man with a rifle.
   Despite numerous statements by union officials condemning
the violence, the lawsuit also alleges that union leaders
haven't acted to halt the attacks and that people engaged in
such activity have continued to receive union strike pay.
   Named as defendants in the suit were Amalgamated Transit;
its bargaining unit, Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local
Unions; and locals in Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C. Several
Amalgamated Council officials were also named, including
President Edward M. Strait and the presidents of the two
locals.
   The suit claims the defendants' actions have cost the unit
of GLI Holding Co. at least $10 million and seeks treble
damages, court and attorney fees and unspecified punitive
damages under Florida law. In addition, Greyhound asked the
court to appoint receivers to take over the two locals,
described by Mr. Lannie as "the two most closely linked to
the violence."
   Meanwhile, at least one union offical named in the suit
hinted that he might file a countersuit against Fred Currey,
Greyhound chairman and chief executive. "I hope he can prove
all that," said Rafael Rivera, president of the Atlanta
local. "He's been going around the country calling union
officials `terrorists.' As far as I'm concerned, he's damaged
my reputation, and he's going to have to answer for that
somewhere down the road."
   Mr. Rivera also said an increasing number of drivers and
union officials would rather drive the current Greyhound
ownership, led by Mr. Currey, into bankruptcy and hope for
new ownership or perhaps an employee buy-out. "Even if there
is a contract, I don't think we could live with him anymore,"
said Mr. Rivera. "The only way this bus line can survive is
for Currey to be gone."
   Greyhound officials said the company isn't for sale.
