   PARIS -- A development bank for the East bloc, with $12
billion of capital, will be set up shortly, following a
two-day meeting that resolved U.S. concerns about Soviet
borrowing and the institution's capital.
   The 42 shareholders -- including the U.S., European
nations, the Soviet Union and Japan -- have finally agreed on
all articles of the constitution of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, according to Jacques Attali,
special adviser to French President Francois Mitterrand. At a
news conference here late yesterday, he said that the
shareholders plan to sign the articles on May 30.

   By that date, the group expects to have decided on the
bank's location and its president, he added. Mr. Attali and
former Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding are leading
contenders for the job. And as many as 10 countries,
including the Netherlands, Britain, Denmark and Austria, have
expressed interest in having the development bank based
there.
   The U.S. wanted -- and obtained -- strict limits on Soviet
borrowing from the bank. It also sought -- and ensured --
that it could subscribe its own capital contribution in
dollars. Under a formula worked out in the talks here,
capital contributions can be made in either European currency
units, dollars or yen. The so-called ECU, which represents a
basket of European currencies, is worth about $1.20.
   "All our major objections have been addressed," said David
Mulford, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs
and the U.S. negotiator, after the meetings ended. As the
U.S. has argued, the bank also "will have a private-sector
emphasis and be focused on the transition to market-oriented
economies," he said.
   "This was the breakthrough meeting," said Mr. Mulford, who
has visited Paris several times this year to discuss the
bank, which began as a French idea, was later embraced by the
entire European Community, and is now becoming a broadly
international organization.
   The U.S., with a 10% share, will be the largest single
shareholder. Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany
will each have shares of 8.52%. Altogether, European nations
will hold a majority stake in the bank.
   The U.S. has been eager to ensure that it is the largest
shareholder and has significant influence over the new
institution. There was a row in the Bush administration when,
in complex negotiations, the U.S. share temporarily dropped
to 8.5%, although Treasury officials have strenuously denied
this. A large role is important to the U.S. goal of ensuring
a strong private-sector orientation for the bank.
   The Soviet Union's role in the bank also has been
controversial. Some shareholders opposed strict limits to
Soviet borrowing. But after long negotiations, the Soviets
wrote a letter setting out a compromise that includes
considerable borrowing restraint, negotiators said.
   Under a compromise that was completed yesterday, the
Soviet Union will be a full member of the bank. But for the
first three years, it will be allowed to borrow only up to an
amount equal to its paid-in capital contribution.
Furthermore, Soviet borrowings will be limited to financing
technical assistance, the private sector and state-owned
companies that are "in the competitive sector," or that are
privatizing.
   The Soviet Union, with a 6% share in the bank, will have
paid-in capital of about $216 million. All of the
shareholders, including the Soviet Union, will pay in only
30% of their capital contributions. The rest of their capital
will be callable. After three years, an 85% majority vote of
the bank's shareholders will be required in order to expand
Soviet borrowing powers.
   Under the other main compromise reached yesterday, share
contributions, which will cover the bank's first five years,
may be made in dollars or yen as well as in ECUs The U.S. had
been unwilling to pay its share in ECUs partly because
Congress makes appropriations in dollars.
   Contributions in dollars and yen will be made at a fixed
exchange rate against the ECU, which will be calculated by
taking the average exchange rate for each currency over the
six months ending next September, the bank's member nations
said at a news conference yesterday.
