   NEW YORK -- CS First Boston Inc. said Archibald Cox Jr.
would join the firm as a member of senior management after a
two-year hiatus from investment banking.
   Mr. Cox resigned as a managing director and head of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.'s London unit in early 1988. He built the
London operation to 1,000 people in 1987 from only 25 people
when he began in 1977.

   For the past two years, Mr. Cox, 49-year-old son of former
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox, has been "dealing with
some family business," and has had two operations on his
right knee. His love of sports, particularly bicycling, also
led him to acquire most of the stock of Serotta Sports Inc.,
Middle Grove, N.Y., a closely held maker of racing bicycles.
   But now Mr. Cox says he is "anxious to get back into the
swing of things." His new job has him coordinating CS First
Boston's European operations with its Pacific unit and its
First Boston Corp. unit in the U.S. CS First Boston is
44.5%-owned by the parent company of Credit Suisse, the giant
Swiss bank.
   CS First Boston President John M. Hennessy has been
reshaping the firm by bringing in outside talent with
established reputations. In January, he shook up the firm's
bond-trading operations by hiring William J. Voute and four
other former top officials of Salomon Brothers Inc. The
Salomon officials, like Mr. Cox, had left their former firms
two years ago.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Hennessy's deputy William E. Mayer in
January was demoted from First Boston chief executive to head
a newly created merchant banking unit.
