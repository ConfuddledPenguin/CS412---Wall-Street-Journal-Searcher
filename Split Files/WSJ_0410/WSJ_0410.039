   AKRON, Ohio -- Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. will report
sharply lower profit for the first quarter, but expects
results to improve in subsequent quarters, Tom H. Barrett,
chairman and chief executive officer, said after the annual
meeting.
   "We made money" in the quarter, he said, but he declined
to make a specific estimate.

   However, Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald &amp; Co.,
Cleveland, who attended the meeting, said he expects the
company to report first-quarter net of between 25 cents and
50 cents a share. In the 1989 first quarter, Goodyear earned
$94.5 million, or $1.64 a share, on sales of $2.64 billion.
   First-quarter profit was reduced by lower tire demand from
auto manufacturers, which resulted in temporary plant
closings at Goodyear, Mr. Barrett said. "Severe pricing
competition in the North American and European replacement
markets" also cut into profit, he said.
   Mr. Barrett said he doesn't expect Goodyear to close
plants in the second quarter, barring a sudden cutback in
auto production.
   In addition, moves by the Brazilian government to brake
inflation in that country are hurting Goodyear's sizable
subsidiary in that country, he said. And the company is
incurring start-up costs on a tire plant in Canada.
   Furthermore, the company's oil pipeline whacked
first-quarter earnings by about 50 cents a share, he said.
The pipeline's losses weren't reflected in the 1989
first-quarter report.
   The pipeline will produce "a quarterly loss of
approximately 50 cents per share until it is more fully
utilized," Mr. Barrett said at the meeting. "The situation
won't get worse," he said, and "there is hope that it could
improve earnings substantially by 1992."
   The problem, Mr. Barrett said, is that offshore California
oil production isn't sufficient to fill the pipeline, which
was built to move crude oil from California to refineries on
the Gulf Coast.
   Mr. Barrett said after the meeting that Goodyear has
suspended efforts to sell the pipeline because there's no
market for it under present conditions. He said he is hopeful
that further drilling by Exxon Corp. and other producers will
provide additional offshore crude. Furthermore, some
producers, such as Chevron Corp., that currently use tankers
to move West Coast crude may be required to switch to the
pipeline, he said, because of the danger of tanker spills and
other damage to the environment.
   At the meeting he outlined a series of actions the company
has taken to make its tire marketing more efficient and more
effective, including introduction of lower-priced tires
carrying the Goodyear brand. "In the U.S. retail operations
alone, we have reduced our work force by about 800 people,"
he said.
