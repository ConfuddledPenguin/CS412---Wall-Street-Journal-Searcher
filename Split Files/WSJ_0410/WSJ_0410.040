   GOTTINGEN, West Germany -- Looking for a warm and cuddly
playmate for the kids? Elfriede Hesse has just the thing: an
East German guard dog.
   "This is a real family pet," says the Gottingen kennel
director, patting a cowering German Shepherd Dog named
Carina. "She's a little neurotic, but sweet as a puppy and
desperate for love."

   Until recently, Carina belonged to the 6,000-dog troop
patrolling the "death strip" between East and West Germany.
Along with machine guns, electrified fences and land mines,
the dogs were part of the intimidating machinery that
deterred East Germans from fleeing to the West.
   But in one of the many state secrets leaking out of East
Germany these days, it turns out the Communists' canine corps
was all bark and no bite. "Most of the dogs were just
decoys," says Ulrich Karlowski, an official with West
Germany's Society for the Protection of Animals. "They were
trained to do simple things like sit and run, not attack
people."
   In recent months, the animal society has taken custody of
400 East German border dogs, fearing they might otherwise be
destroyed. Ms. Hesse headed across the border in a convoy of
six cars -- one for each dog she intended to bring back --
because she assumed the animals would be hard to handle. But
the only snarls were from West German border soldiers, who
delayed the convoy so a veterinarian could examine the dogs.
   When their arrival here -- 10 miles from the border -- was
trumpeted in the local press, she was besieged with inquiries
from would-be dog owners. "They all wanted vicious guard
dogs," she says. "What they found were duds."
   Accustomed to being chained, some of the East German dogs
are reluctant even to give chase, preferring to walk in tight
circles. "They seem very frightened when the other dogs
bark," says Ms. Hesse, who so far has placed four of the East
German dogs with local families.
   She herself prefers a West German Rottweiler for guard
duty at the kennel. "Now he might give you a bite," she says
of the fierce-looking creature.
   Aspiring escapees from communism weren't the only ones
fooled by the dogs. An East German border guard named Georg
says he, too, assumed they could tear him to pieces. "I was
scared to walk near them on my patrols," he recalls. "Then I
noticed that none of them even barked at me. It was all just
a bluff."
