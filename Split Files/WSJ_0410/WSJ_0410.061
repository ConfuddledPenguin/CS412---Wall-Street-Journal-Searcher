   Is it coincidence?
   The nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island took
place at 4 a.m., with a crew that had just rotated from the
day shift to night work.

   The Chernobyl reactor exploded at 1:23 a.m.
   And it was shortly after midnight when shift workers at
the Bhopal chemical plant began the chain of errors that led
to the fatal poisoning of more than 2,000 people.
   That these industrial disasters all occurred in the wee
hours of the morning wasn't a matter of chance but, rather,
biology, according to a growing band of scientists known as
chronobiologists. These researchers -- physicians,
psychologists, physiologists and mathematicians -- study the
mysterious biological rhythms that govern everything from
alertness and sleep to hormone production and body
temperature.
   The chronobiologists' goal is ambitious: They seek the
ability to reset the human body clock, whenever work or
travel knocks it out of synch with its surroundings. Their
findings could help the important worker who can't afford to
doze off on the night shift and who doesn't want to spend
sleepless mornings staring at his bedroom ceiling, unable to
fall asleep. They could help the executive who flies through
six time zones one day and, two days later, snoozes at a
board meeting.
   "People are nodding off in the workplace, on the highways,
in the cockpits," says Martin Moore-Ede, the director of
Boston's Institute for Circadian Physiology, a nonprofit
research outfit that focuses on alertness problems of
shiftworkers. "It's a fundamental mismatch between man, who
sleeps at night, and a high-tech world that expects him to be
as alert at 4 a.m. as he is at 10 a.m."
   Though chronobiology has blossomed as a science only in
the past 10 years, its practitioners have already had an
impact. They have developed new ways of scheduling labor to
ease the demands of shift work in the petrochemical and
utility industries, in nursing and in police work.
Chronobiologists have found that administering anti-cancer
drugs at certain times of the day makes them far more
effective and increases a patient's tolerance for strong
doses. And they are working on new ways to improve the
disturbed sleep patterns of the elderly.
   Chronobiologists have even come up with a remedy for jet
lag. Harvard Medical School researchers last year were able
to show that the body clock is profoundly affected by light
and darkness and can be reset -- to any new time zone -- by
precisely timed exposures to bright light. The researchers
use high-intensity fluorescent lights, but they say airline
passengers can accomplish much the same thing simply by
spending certain hours in daylight at their destinations.
   The scientific work concentrates on a tiny group of nerve
cells just behind the eyes known as the superchiasmatic
nuclei (SCN), along with the pineal gland, a pea-sized organ
located a few centimeters deeper in the brain. Together, they
make up the biological clock, or, as the scientists call it,
the circadian pacemaker. (Circadian, from the Latin "circa"
and dies, means "approximately a day.")
   French philosopher Rene Descartes called the pineal gland
the seat of the soul. And until just a few years ago, no one
had a better idea of its function; physicians considered it a
useless, vestigial organ. Now it has become fashionable, the
subject of textbooks and conferences. The pineal receives
information on the day-night cycle from the eyes, via the
SCN, and at the appropriate time pours a sleep-inducing
hormone called melatonin into the bloodstream. The change
from light to dark, or the reverse, is a time cue. Darkness
starts melatonin production; bright light shuts it off.
   It turns out the human clock is a poor timekeeper, running
at a rate of 25 hours a day in most people. Accordingly, it
must be reset daily by strong time cues such as the
light-dark cycle, or by other, weaker cues -- meal time,
periods of activity, regular social interaction. The body
accomplishes this resetting readily -- unless a worker should
happen to be trying to stay awake at 2 a.m. when all the time
cues tell him he should be in bed. Or unless a jet setter has
just flown nonstop from New York to Tokyo and knocked his
body clock out of synch with his surroundings.
   The natural, 25-hour "day" helps explain a curiosity
noticed by nearly all frequent fliers: Less sensation of jet
lag flying west than flying east. Heading west lengthens the
day, or retards the body clock, which is already running late
on its 25-hour cycle. But heading east shortens the day and
advances the body clock, fighting its natural slow-poke
tendency. Thus, on a trip west it is easier to stay up late
the first day, go to sleep at the local time and then adhere
to local schedules. East-bound fliers, on the other hand,
find it difficult to fall asleep earlier than their body's
normal sleep time and hard to function the next few mornings
at an hour when they would normally be sleeping.
   A 1988 survey of 800 long-haul air travelers conducted by
Upjohn Co. found that 94% suffered symptoms of jet lag, with
48% describing them as severe. They feel sleepy during the
day, are sleepless at night; they concentrate poorly and have
digestive upsets. The group fought jet lag by avoiding
alcohol on the flight (28%), adopting the sleeping hours of
their destination before embarking on the trip (18%),
exercising daily after arrival (21%) or resting a few days
after arrival (26%).
   Chronobiologists don't quarrel with trying the first three
tactics, but resting is a mistake, they believe. Recent
research in Canada suggests that exercise acts as a time cue
to resynchronize circadian rhythms. Better yet, the experts
say, get the exercise during daylight -- in the midmorning
when you have flown east, in late afternoon or early evening
for a westward flight. Light in the mornings of the new time
zone stops melatonin production, advancing the body clock for
eastward travel; light in the afternoon or early evening
delays the onset of melatonin and thus retards the clock for
a westward trip.
   "The secret is to be immediately active in the new time
zone and to be outside at the right time," says James
Waterhouse, a chronobiologist at England's University of
Manchester. "Strengthen every time cue you can find."
   Direct sunlight isn't necessary for resetting the body
clock; outdoor light no brighter than that found an hour
after dawn will do the job. But what happens if light is
needed after the sun goes down?
   Artificial light is an obvious answer, and
chronobiologists are looking to find practical and economical
ways to deliver it to the body clock. Fluorescent-light boxes
already are widely used to treat a type of winter depression
called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. They're about the
size of suitcases -- not exactly something one would take
along on a business trip. One possibility: more-compact boxes
and light-delivering goggles that could aim light into the
periphery of the retina while the wearer is reading or doing
paper work.
   Another approach under study is to put the lights in
airplanes or in hotels or conference centers. Harvard Medical
School Prof. Charles Czeisler, considered to be at the
forefront of bright-light research, says he is talking with
two airlines about installing light units.
   Further in the future is a possible jet-lag pill
containing the melatonin hormone itself. Josephine Arendt, a
chronobiologist at the University of Surrey in England, has
been publishing research since 1984 showing that melatonin,
which has no known adverse side effects, alleviates many of
the symptoms of jet lag and helps reset the body's sleep-wake
cycle to new time zones. Recently she started administering
melatonin to men at Britain's Antarctic research base, where
the sun disappears for three months every winter, disrupting
everyone's circadian rhythm.
   Some other chronobiologists have reservations about oral
melatonin; they feel it might improve sleep patterns simply
because it is a soporific. They agree it could use more
study.
   Jet-lagged travelers and shift workers whose schedules
keep changing suffer from the same problem -- out-of-phase
body clocks -- but shift workers are much worse off. The
standard shift rotation in the U.S. is to work a week of
days, followed by a week of nights, then a week of evenings.
In between, rotations usually entail having a few days off --
and, then, workers naturally try to get back on the same
sleep-wake schedules as their families and friends. It is
like spending a week in Denver, a week in Paris and a week in
Tokyo, says Dr. Moore-Ede of the Institute of Circadian
Physiology, adding, "We're talking perpetual jet lag."
   Studies show that shift workers -- at last count some 21
million in the U.S. -- are far more prone than day workers to
heart attacks, ulcers, depression and serious sleep
disorders. On average, they also perform much more poorly on
the job, sometimes drifting off into what researchers' jargon
calls "episodes of microsleep."
   Changing the direction of shift rotation is one
improvement recommended by chronologists, and it is catching
on fast in industry. They suggest switching to a clockwise
rotation, or day-evening-night, from the more-usual
counterclockwise rotation of day-night-evening, thus taking
advantage of the biological clock's natural drift to later
hours. Surveys at companies that have made the change suggest
that workers adapt 50% faster to clockwise-rotating shift
changes, and that productivity rises while accident rates
fall. Specialists also recommend that workers stay on a
particular shift for more than a week at a time, so as to
give their circadian rhythms more time to stabilize.
   But the hottest research in chronobiology today is in
seeking ways to rearrange the circadian rhythms of
night-shift workers by using pulses of bright light. This
differs from bright-light treatment for jet lag, where the
goal is to synchronize a traveler's circadian rhythms to a
new local time. For workers, the idea is to move the
circadian low point -- the trough of body temperature and
alertness that normally occurs between four and five in the
morning -- to a time when workers are off duty and trying to
sleep. That would keep people more alert on the night shift
and also help them get to sleep during the day.
   Several teams of chronobiologists are developing so-called
bright-light work stations. These might be banks of
wide-spectrum fluorescent bulbs clustered around the gauges
or video monitors a control-room operator must watch by
night. A four-hour pulse of bright light on the first
night-shift could well be enough to move the circadian low
point into the daytime hours -- and keep it there until the
worker is back on day shifts. During the light treatment, a
worker could do his usual job, or catch up on paper work. "It
wouldn't be much different from reading a book outdoors,"
says a researcher.
   This sort of bright-light treatment would be practical
only for the minority of shift-workers who have sedentary
jobs, such as monitoring a factory-control panel. But, the
scientists point out, that is just the sort of employee who
is in a position to cause, or prevent, a meltdown.
