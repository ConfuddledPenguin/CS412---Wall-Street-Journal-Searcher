   With proxy fights proliferating, takeover defense lawyer
Martin Lipton has a new idea for companies worried about
their directors being voted out of office: don't let
shareholders vote as often.
   Mr. Lipton, a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz,
suggests that directors ought to be elected to terms of five
years, instead of one or three, in what he calls a
"quinquennial system." Under his proposal, the annual meeting
would be eliminated, and shareholders would only meet every
five years.

   Currently, most companies either elect all their directors
annually, or have staggered boards, with one-third up for
election each year. Staggered boards came into widespread use
early in the 1980s as an anti-takeover defense.
   "We need to strike a balance," Mr. Lipton said in a memo
to clients. "A balance that facilitates long-term planning by
corporations but does not entrench bad management." With such
a system, he added, "directors would run on the corporation's
record for the past five years and the corporation's
strategic plan for the next five years."
   However, Mr. Lipton acknowledged the idea would require
changes in state laws, federal securities laws and stock
exchange rules.
