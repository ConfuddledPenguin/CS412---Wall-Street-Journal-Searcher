   International Business Machines Corp. is discussing plans
to back Go Corp., a closely held maker of innovative "slate"
personal computers, industry executives indicated.
   The exact nature of the backing couldn't be learned, but
the executives indicated that it will likely include
financial support, and may extend to licensing of IBM's
advanced handwriting-recognition technology. IBM, Armonk,
N.Y., may also consider reselling Go's computers to its own
customers.

   IBM and Go declined to comment on the arrangement, sketchy
details of which were reported yesterday in PC Week, an
industry newspaper.
   Go, based in Foster City, Calif., is developing a
hand-held computer that users control with an electronic
"stylus" rather than a keyboard. Instead of typing in data
and commands, users write with the penlike instrument on the
computer's display.
   This type of "slate" computer is being touted as the ideal
tool for workers on the move -- delivery people, sales
representatives, and insurance adjusters, for example.
   Grid Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Tandy Corp., Fort
Worth, Texas, already makes a slate computer. Several
Japanese companies have introduced slates that recognize
Japanese characters, and are expected to enter the U.S.
market soon.
   Sony Corp., for example, last month announced a 2.8 pound
book-size slate that it said would create a new computer
market in much the same way the Walkman, its miniature
cassette player, revolutionized the personal entertainment
industry in the early 1980s. For now, the product is
available only in Japan.
   But Go, founded in 1988 by executives from Ashton-Tate
Corp. and Lotus Development Corp., has caught the imagination
of many in the computer industry. That interest has
translated into investment dollars and software promises, and
has also attracted some high-powered talent, such as Dan'l
Lewin, recently lured from Next Inc.
   IBM's involvement will likely enhance Go's ability to set
standards in this emerging industry segment. "If it's true,
it's a real good business decision for both companies," said
Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter.
