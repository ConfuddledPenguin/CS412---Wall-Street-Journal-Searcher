   Kinburn Corp., an Ottawa industrial holding company, said
it was forced to give up its control of SHL Systemhouse Inc.,
a major Canadian computer-systems integration company.
   Kinburn previously had announced it wouldn't be able to
repay 831 million Canadian dollars (US$713.1 million) of
loans outstanding, which became payable yesterday. The loans
included about C$415 million due to BCE Inc., a
Montreal-based holding company.

   BCE, which owns 12.4% of Systemhouse shares, had an option
to acquire 49% of Kinburn between 1993 and 1996. Kinburn said
discussions between Kinburn and BCE broke down Friday.
   Kinburn owns 50.1% of Systemhouse through its subsidiary
Kinburn Technology Corp. Kinburn Technology had guaranteed
the loans that were made to its parent, pledging its
controlling interest in Systemhouse as well as other assets.
