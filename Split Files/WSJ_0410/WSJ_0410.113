   NEW YORK -- The two-hour movie that introduced Capital
Cities/ABC Inc.'s dramatic series "Twin Peaks" blew away the
competition Sunday night. In A.C. Nielsen Co.'s overnight
ratings from 23 markets, "Twin Peaks" pulled in a 22% rating,
while CBS Inc. had a rating of 11.3%, General Electric Co.'s
NBC had a 10.8% rating and the Fox Broadcasting Co. network's
rating was 10.4%. A rating point equals 921,000 households.
   The first television series by movie director David Lynch
got rave reviews for its surreal mood and lurid images, but
some ABC insiders were worried that "Twin Peaks" might be too
weird to be popular. "There was certainly concern about
mainstream appeal," said an ABC spokeswoman. "We're gratified
by the response, but we're waiting to see how it does in its
regular time period." Starting this Thursday night, "Twin
Peaks" will be up against tougher competition: NBC's popular
"Cheers."
