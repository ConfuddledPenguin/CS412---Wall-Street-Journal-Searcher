   USAIR GROUP Inc.'s fleet includes 193 aircraft classified
as the quieter Stage 3 jets, or 43.8% of the airline's total.
In yesterday's edition, a chart provided by Avmark Inc.
incorrectly placed USAir's Stage 3 share at 175 planes and
39.4% of its fleet.

   INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES Corp. clarified a growth
estimate it made in yesterday's edition. The company expects
revenue from its Personal System/2 business, not its
personal-systems business, to grow by a percentage in the
midteens or better, a spokesman said. The personal-systems
business includes both PS/2 personal computers and
workstations.
