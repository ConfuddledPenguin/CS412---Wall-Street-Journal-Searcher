   China has fallen silent. After the killings at Tiananmen
Square last June, the corrupt Communist Party, bankrupt of
ideas and hated by its people, has opened a new era of fear.
   When China is quiet, outsiders only learn much later the
details of secretly inflicted sufferings endured by China's
people. In "Legacies: A Chinese Mosaic" (Knopf, 245 pages,
$19.95), Bette Bao Lord has gathered personal histories of
friends and families as they were caught in the machinery of
past political crackdowns. Their biographies make an
appalling dossier, but this catalog of gently told horror
stories is all the more painful because new pages are being
added in China as we read it.

   Mrs. Lord, author of the best-selling novel "Spring Moon,"
and her husband, Winston, a former U.S. ambassador to China,
were staunch supporters of Deng Xiaoping's China until
Tiananmen Square. Now, they are among the few prominent
Washington-connected China experts who have protested
President Bush's eagerness to overlook Tiananmen's bloodshed
in the name of geopolitics. Mrs. Lord's "Legacies" forcefully
underlines the irrationality of a White House that gloats and
blusters about the importance of freedom in Panama and
Lithuania, but turns its back on China's people and beds down
with China's tyrants.
   What makes Mrs. Lord's tales of Communist Party-ordered
suffering especially horrible is that they demonstrate how
successfully the system has inspired the Chinese people to
suspect and betray one another.
   Children shun parents. Wives sell out husbands. Production
units ostracize individuals.
   In 1985, when the Lords arrived in Beijing to start his
ambassadorship, China appeared to have changed. Mao Tse-tung
was increasingly forgotten. Reform was under way. China was
rejoining the world economy. Chinese could speak more freely
to foreigners. Deng Xiaoping was Time magazine's Man of the
Year. Optimists like Mrs. Lord believed the Communist Party
could be reformed from within.
   Three-and-a-half years later, Mrs. Lord -- no longer an
optimist -- left Beijing just days before the People's
Liberation Army opened fire on the people last June 4. Her
book ends with voices speaking after the killings from new
pressure chambers of fear. "Here there is no air," says one
man who even before Tiananmen had spent the best years of his
life in prison. "There are no words to describe to innocents
the mysterious density of terror."
   Innocence in Communist China has been the belief that
better times will last. Instead, repression has followed each
relaxation.
   The Chinese who gave Mrs. Lord their tape-recorded
histories all lost their innocence one way or another.
"Legacies" skillfully mixes their tales with a narrative of
Mrs. Lord's experience. She keeps her tone level, but leaves
a reader a legacy of sadness and outrage.
   A scholar, now 87 years old, once dared to criticize the
pre-Communist government. He also made the mistake of
studying abroad. For these errors he has never been trusted.
No one has hired him. "You can't imagine what it has been
like for me. Three degrees, three summa cum laudes from three
famed universities, and never any responsibilities, never]
The boredom. The monotony."
   An actress remembers turning against her father when she
was seven years old because the Communist Party branded him a
"rightist, third class."
   She was ashamed of him. Her mother divorced him. He was
sent to work among peasants, was tortured and committed
suicide. "My daughter, do not despise me," he asked in a
final note.
   "Peace has yet to come to me," the actress says at the end
of her tale. "Perhaps it is because when I was very young I
shouldn't have understood that politics is all, but I did."
Sooner or later, the Communist Party has forced everyone to
understand that politics -- as defined by the party -- is
all.
   Pain is inflicted in strange ways. A cadre learns from his
interrogator that it was his wife who betrayed him. A man is
made to wear women's clothes in prison. A work unit forces a
couple to divorce.
   A man spends two years on death row, awaking each morning
to listen as someone else is taken away to be killed.
Inexplicably, he isn't chosen. Equally inexplicably, he is
freed.
   "Legacies" has a few saccharine passages, notably when
Mrs. Lord presents some impressions of the U.S. brought home
by traveling Chinese. Believe it or not, she quotes a New
York undercover policeman explaining that he won't arrest
prostitutes working Times Square unless they directly solicit
him because: "Better all go free than for me to jail one
innocent girl."
   But for the most part, Mrs. Lord writes with quiet
precision. She speaks Chinese, having left China for the U.S.
at the age of eight, and she got close to her subjects.
   They clearly trusted her. She has rewarded that trust by
making readers understand the forces that have caused so many
Chinese to fall victim to the tyranny of their Communist
rulers.
