   ATLANTA -- In the process of kicking a bad habit, Kenneth
Beverly and Nate Mack found a role in the business of
treating drug and alcohol addiction.
   Mr. Beverly, 41, and Mr. Mack, 33, both black and admitted
former drug-abusers, met by chance at a Narcotics Anonymous
meeting here in 1988 and found they were concerned about the
same problem: the large numbers of black alcohol and drug
addicts for whom traditional rehabilitation programs just
didn't seem to stick.

   The result is Coalesce, a for-profit partnership that Mr.
Beverly and Mr. Mack formed with health-care professionals
last May. Coalesce specializes in "culturally specific"
therapies for black substance-abusers.
   A close look at Coalesce -- whose name is meant to suggest
a uniting of the black community to fight addiction -- shows
that even severe personal problems can be transmuted into a
promising business. Coalesce is attracting patients -- and
their money -- by regarding blacks as special while most
substance-abuse centers treat members of all races
identically. On the basis of their firsthand experience as
blacks with drug problems, the founders think their approach
will work better.
   Other substance-abuse professionals agree. Peter Bell, the
founder and former executive director of the Institute on
Black Chemical Abuse in Minneapolis, says standard treatment
programs in this country -- which number more than 2,000 --
have been most successful with those blacks "who either don't
come from the black community or don't return to it" after
therapy. But most black substance-abusers, authorities say,
do return to a black community.
   In treating blacks differently, Coalesce is on the cutting
edge of a trend in drug and alcohol treatment. A. Thomas
McLellan, a psychologist and scientific director for the
Philadelphia Veterans Administration Center for Studies of
Addiction, says several "culturally specific" programs have
emerged in recent years -- for such groups as American
Indians, Hispanics, pregnant women, even night-shift (as
opposed to day-shift) workers. Mr. McLellan cautions that
although such programs "make sense," the jury is still out on
whether or not they actually get better results than
conventional approaches.
   To serve blacks, Coalesce has contracts with three
Atlanta-area hospitals -- Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Decatur, and
Ridgeview Institute -- that use its program to supplement
their own treatment of black patients. So far, there have
been about 300 Coalesce patients, some from as far away as
Michigan and New York. About nine of every 10 are insured or
otherwise able to pay the $13,000 fee for the program's
required 30 days of hospitalization and 90 days of outpatient
care. Mr. Mack says that a portion of revenue is set aside
for the remaining 10% that cannot afford the treatment.
   About 20% of the Coalesce patients are treated only for
alcoholism, another 20% only for drug addiction; some 60% are
treated for "cross-addiction" to both. Three of four patients
are male. Most, but not all, of the patients are black.
   Once in the hospital, the Coalesce patient meets regularly
with a black therapist in both one-on-one and group sessions
directed at discovering the extent to which the patient's
experience as a black person influences addiction and
recovery.
   In that setting, Mr. Beverly says, blacks are more likely
than in conventional treatment programs to talk freely about
such personal issues -- which, if pent up, are thought to
contribute to substance-abuse -- as low self-esteem or sexual
problems. He recalls one man who had been in a standard
treatment program without success, but who made progress
after Coalesce got him to talk about having been raped in
prison. Says Mr. Beverly: "Incest, homosexuality? Most blacks
aren't going to bring those issues up around white people."
   Bringing out such issues is an important part of the
Coalesce approach. "We have to evaluate whether there is
racial self-hate and create a forum for our patients to be
able to process these feelings, which may be suppressed but,
if not resolved, make people relapse," Mr. Beverly says.
   Another aspect that distinguishes Coalesce from many other
programs is its strong emphasis on involving the addict's
family in treatment. Counselors visit family members and
others close to the patient and make an extensive evaluation
of the home environment. Family members are included in a
counseling process that begins before the patient enters
treatment and continues throughout both the hospital stay and
outpatient period.
   "Too frequently, black patients go back into communities,
neighborhoods and families that are drug-infested," Mr. Mack
says. "We evaluate the families and the home situation."
   So far, Coalesce is getting good marks from its client
hospitals. "I've seen a change in attitude among blacks in
treatment: They feel more a part of the program," says Rick
Nelson, director of rehabilitation programs at Decatur. "For
a long time, we used to downplay differences and emphasize
similarities. For some specialty groups that hasn't worked in
the long run for us."
   Tom Douglas, director of adult and chemical dependence
services at Ridgeview, says it is premature to judge
Coalesce's long-term effectiveness. But he says: "At this
point, it looks good. Their staff seems very knowledgeable
and dedicated."
   In a tough industry, Coalesce will need all that and more.
Rehabilitation specialists say demand for for-profit,
inpatient care seems to be ebbing. They cite recent declines
in the number of people abusing drugs and alcohol, employer
cutbacks in employee health benefits, and a trend favoring
outpatient treatment. But Mr. Beverly and Mr. Mack wax
optimistic, with talk of expanding Coalesce to other cities.
Recently, they leased eight three-bedroom apartments here
that they plan to use as residences for patients needing
extended care.
   Before founding the business, Mr. Beverly had worked for
15 years in clinical and administrative positions with drug
and alcohol treatment programs, and Mr. Mack had years of
sales and marketing experience with a British pharmaceutical
company, but the duo lacked capital. A third partner, Loul
Asfaw, provided the start-up financing. (Coalesce won't
disclose the amount.) And recently, Coalesce obtained a
$50,000 line of credit with Trust Co. Bank of Georgia.
   The founders expect to profit eventually, though they say
Coalesce, which projects $1.5 million in revenue for the
year, is only at the break-even point for now. The company
has a staff of 18 that includes certified counselors, a
nutritionist and a recreational therapist.
   Even without proof that "culturally specific" programs get
better results for patients, Coalesce's pitch to blacks is
clearly a draw for some people who might otherwise avoid
treatment. Says Michael Ford, chief executive officer of the
National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers,
"Anything that helps people get into, complete and be
successful in treatment is great."
