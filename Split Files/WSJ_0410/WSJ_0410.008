   A small U.S. computer maker plans to turn the tables on
NEC Corp. by cloning the giant Tokyo company's most popular
personal computer and selling it to the computer-hungry
Japanese, at lower prices. AST Research Inc. plans to unveil
tomorrow in Tokyo a computer that mimics NEC's PC-9801, a
machine that has captured more than half of Japan's
personal-computer market, which is the world's second
largest, after the U.S.
   The Irvine, Calif., company's move is radical, and risky,
because it centers on a product that is made purely for the
Japanese market and so won't be sold in the U.S. While many
Japanese companies take that tactic -- NEC and others peddle
personal computers in the U.S. that they don't sell at home
-- no foreign company has so directly assaulted NEC's
near-monopoly of the Japanese market. NEC's machines have
become de facto standards in Japan's booming
business-computer market, much as International Business
Machines Corp.'s personal-computer architecture is a de facto
standard in the U.S.

   The AST machine also could become a test of how open the
Japanese market really is for competitive U.S. products.
Japanese trade officials often complain that U.S. companies,
including computer makers, don't make products that match
Japanese shoppers' buying patterns. Among U.S. computer
manufacturers, only IBM has managed to garner even a fraction
of the Japanese personal-computer market. Apple Computer
Inc., which sells a Japanese-language version of its
Macintosh computer, has only a minuscule share. NEC software
won't run on either of those company's machines.
   A U.S. Commerce Department official will accompany AST at
the unveiling to show official support, says Joan McEntee,
deputy undersecretary for export at the department. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher "feels very strongly that it's a
good example of a product meeting the Japanese on their own
ground," she says. "It's a good test of the supposed new
openness of the Japanese market."
   AST says it has consulted with NEC about its cloning plans
and that NEC isn't opposed to the new competitor entering its
turf. AST expressed confidence that patent questions won't
arise.
   An NEC spokeswoman in Tokyo said, "We do know AST is going
to make an announcement, but we're not too sure what kind of
machine it will be." She added, "I don't think we would
comment on other companies' strategies."
   Only one company, Japan's Seiko Epson Corp., has cloned
the NEC machine. While unabashed about copying U.S. computer
technology, the Japanese have politely shied away from
mimicking each others', leaving a rare, nearly uncontested
Japanese market.
   "It's one of those huge, untapped markets for aggressive
overseas companies," says Safi Qureshey, AST's president and
chief executive officer.
   Copying another bit of Japan's export strategy, AST plans
to undercut NEC's pricing while offering more features. And
in an unusual reversal, it will offer the machine for sale
under Japanese brand names, much as Japanese TV makers sell
sets to U.S. vendors for sale under American labels. AST says
it is negotiating with several concerns, including
consumer-electronics giant Sharp Corp., that are interested
in selling the machine.
   The new AST machine, called the AST Dual SX/16, will run
the thousands of software packages written for the NEC
computer as well as programs written for the IBM personal
computer. The machine uses Intel Corp.'s 80386SX
microprocessor, a set of chips made by Japan's Kawasaki Steel
Corp. and some internal software written by a small Japanese
company named Tomcat Computer Corp.
   The move comes from a scrappy company that has been
pushing heavily overseas as the U.S. personal-computer market
grows more crowded. AST runs Russian-language advertisements
in the Soviet Union and pushes overseas sales in India and
other foreign markets that are largely ignored by many U.S.
personal-computer companies. AST, with sales of $456.6
million in the year ended June 30, 1989, expects the Japanese
machine to become a major revenue contributor.
