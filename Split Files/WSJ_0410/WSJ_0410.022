   PITTSBURGH -- Equimark Corp. said it expects to report a
first-quarter net loss of between $13.5 million and $15.5
million, or $1.21 a share and $1.38 a share.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Equimark earned $5.7 million,
or 50 cents a share.

   Separately, Equimark said it agreed to sell most of its
credit-card receivables to Banc One Corp. in Columbus, Ohio.
Terms weren't disclosed. The sale includes about $350 million
in Equimark accounts. Equimark will keep about $113 million
in noncredit-card revolving credit receivables.
   Equimark indicated in January that it would sell the
credit-card business because consolidation in that industry
makes it increasingly difficult for smaller credit-card
issuers to compete.
   The diversified financial services company has been
selling certain assets to help finance its federally assisted
acquisition of ailing National Bancshares of Texas, based in
San Antonio.
   For the latest quarter, Equimark's projected loss is due
to a "significant increase" in the company's provision for
possible loan losses and to losses related to the sale or
write-down of certain nonperforming real estate.
   Equimark said its reserve for possible loan losses at
March 31 is projected to be about $6 million higher than the
year-end 1989 balance of about $42 million. The loan loss
reserve is also projected to cover about 75% of the total
nonearning assets at the end of the quarter, as compared with
63% at the end of 1989.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Equimark closed at $9.375, unchanged.
