   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Barron Hilton has checked back
into Hilton Hotels Corp.
   Mr. Hilton says he's left the auctioneer's stand
permanently to reclaim his seat as chairman, chief executive
officer and largest shareholder of the hotel and casino
company.

   "I have no plans to put the company back up for sale," he
says.
   The venerable Hilton name could stand some burnishing in
the aftermath of the frustrating 10-month auction. The
company faces tough times in the domestic lodging market and
unprecedented competition among Nevada casinos. But even
before he gets back down to business, the 62-year-old
executive must persuade everyone that the company is no
longer on the block.
   Persons close to Hilton bidders Alfred Checchi, Frederic
Malek and Gary Wilson say that the NWA Inc. owners are still
trying to obtain financing to salvage a deal for Hilton
Hotels. People close to Chicago-based JMB Realty Corp. say
they might consider picking up the pieces of their proposal,
valued at about $76 a share or roughly $3.7 billion.
   But according to Mr. Hilton, that won't happen. "We have
no interest in that," he says. "We are off the market."
   Hilton's stock, which peaked at $115.50 during a
speculative frenzy last August, came down to earth when the
negotiations were spiked March 7. But it still reflects a
healthy takeover premium as die-hard market players and
others load up. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Monday, Hilton's stock closed at $52.875,down 12.5 cents.
   Despite rumors on Wall Street, Hilton apparently doesn't
have any debt-financed special dividends, restructurings or
single-property sales in the works. Although many investors
and Wall Street observers accuse Hilton's board of scuttling
the negotiations through their indecisiveness, the company
doesn't seem willing to appease them by piling on debt or
making other drastic moves.
   Mr. Hilton says the company isn't considering a share
buy-back, although the company may consider that from time to
time. Nor does he seem anxious to part with crown jewels such
as the 50%-owned Hilton Hawaiian Village, which he deems
irreplaceable, or New York's famed Waldorf-Astoria.
   But Hilton faces a pitched battle to maintain its ranking
as a top operator. On the hotel side, aggressors such as
Marriott Corp. and Hyatt Hotels Corp. have muscled in to
challenge Hilton's traditional dominance of the domestic
upscale hotel segment. Others, such as Promus Cos., have
gotten off to a fast start in other segments, such as
all-suite properties.
   Mr. Hilton says his company plans to ride out the
much-publicized overbuilding in the domestic market by
moderate growth in its all-suite and franchised CrestHil
hotel lines. Last year, Hilton completed a $1 billion-plus
renovation of its classic properties, including the Waldorf
and Chicago's Palmer House.
   Hilton's future seems inexorably tied to the international
market. Although overseas investors didn't want to pay top
dollar for its assets, foreigners have a real taste for
Hilton accommodations that the company wants to exploit to
the fullest.
   Foreign guests accounted for 22.2% of total occupancy at
Hilton's top 15 destination hotels in the U.S. in 1989, up
sharply from 12.8% in 1985. Hilton says it expects that trend
to continue, with international travelers accounting for more
than 30% of total occupancy by 1995.
   Hilton also boasts extraordinary consumer recognition. A
recent independent study of world-wide consumer product brand
recognition ranked Hilton as the 12th most esteemed brand in
the world.
   The company is expanding its overseas hotel unit, Conrad
International Hotels, to tap that visibility and snare its
share of global travel growth. One rub that analysts forsee,
though, is getting customers to realize that Conrad hotels --
named for company founder Conrad Nicholson Hilton -- are
indeed Hilton properties. The company sold off the Hilton
International chain years ago, and is prohibited from using
the name overseas.
   The Conrad hotels expansion, engineered in part by Barron
Hilton's brother, Eric, will take some time to reach the
"critical mass" deemed necessary to establish a hotel chain,
analysts say. Mr. Hilton says the unit currently is in
discussions on several possible projects, some of which may
play off of its casino expertise.
   The Nevada gambling business is anything but a sure bet
these days, even for old hands like Hilton. Las Vegas is in
the midst of explosive growth amid huge expansions and
splashy new resorts such as Golden Nugget Inc.'s Mirage and
Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.'s Excalibur.
   Competitors and Wall Street observers say the lengthy sale
negotiations so distracted management last year that the
casinos made some uncharacteristic slips. Hilton admits that
O'Shea's, its new budget-gambler's mecca along the Las Vegas
Strip, was opened before it was ready last year, and that
construction at the Flamingo Hilton next door took its toll.
Those factors, as well as bad luck at the gaming tables,
caused the casinos' operating income to slide to $102.6
million in 1989 from $128.6 million in 1988.
   Hilton has launched a new marketing program for its
Flamingo casinos, and is slated to open a new 2,000-room
Flamingo Hilton casino in burgeoning Laughlin, Nev. this
summer. The company expects stronger gambling results this
year now that most of the extensive remodeling and
construction are completed.
   Outwardly, Hilton and its business plan appear untouched
by the recent corporate drama. But one imponderable will be
the long term effect on Hilton's reputation and investor
confidence, both of which were bruised.
   In hindsight, Mr. Hilton recognizes the problems with
timing and approach. "I'm the first to admit that we missed
the window," Mr. Hilton says. "Had we had a crystal ball, we
would have targeted a strategic buyer" instead of opting for
the auction process.
   Even so, he adds, the company would probably have been
criticized by observers questioning whether the company got
the best price by negotiating exclusively with one bidder.
The bids the company did receive were contingent on financing
and licensing, he says, which posed a risk the board finally
deemed unacceptable.
   Mr. Hilton is still smarting from the barbs over the
potential for increasing his net worth, as he owns 24.5% of
Hilton's stock outright. "Some analysts said Barron Hilton
can't afford not to accept an offer for this company," he
says with a trace of anger. "A lot of people thought I'd go
for the money. I felt a responsibility to our shareholders
not to sell in an unfashionable climate."
   Business climate, like investor confidence, has a way of
coming around in better times. Most experts say foreign
investors' appetites for hotels and real estate eventually
will rebound. So might Hilton sport another for-sale sign in
the near future?
   "I'm staying in the saddle," Mr. Hilton responds.
