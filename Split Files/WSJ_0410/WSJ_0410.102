   Oil prices plunged again on new worries of a glut.
   The declines were world-wide -- and the price erosion that
had begun a few days ago and dropped U.S. crude futures more
than $1 a barrel last week appeared to be accelerating. Crude
futures were down yesterday to some of the lowest levels
since last summer.

   West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery fell 71
cents a barrel to settle at $18.44 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The June crude contract was down 61 cents to
$18.95. Futures prices of fuels also were off sharply, with
the May contract for unleaded gasoline down 1.22 cents a
gallon.
   Prices of petroleum outside the futures market also
continued to slide. U.S. refiners yesterday generally reduced
the prices they pay for West Texas Intermediate crude in the
field by 75 cents a barrel, to $17.50.
   Meanwhile, bearish sentiment swept through European spot
markets. North Sea crudes declined between 45 cents and 60
cents a barrel from Friday's closing prices.
   Analysts agree the reason for the sell-off was further
evidence of a surplus of crude oil. They said it's due to two
factors: The seasonal slackening in demand for oil at this
time of the year -- underscored by the large number of
refineries that are buying less crude because of maintenance
schedulings -- and the continued high production by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The Middle East Economic Survey is the latest industry
publication to cite high OPEC output. It reported that OPEC
produced nearly 24.1 million barrels of crude oil a day in
March, the highest monthly output since 1981.
   But more oil analysts are beginning to look for a price
recovery before the end of the second quarter, which is
traditionally a sluggish oil-demand period.
   At the least, "the declines in prices should slow down by
the second half of the quarter," said George F. Friesen, oil
analyst with Deutsche Bank Capital Corp., New York. By then,
he said, most refineries will have completed their spring
maintenance and will be back in the market for crude.
   Also, some oil analysts expect OPEC soon to try to do
something about the price fall. "OPEC overproduction has
begun to hurt, but not yet enough to bring back production
discipline," said Fereidun Fesharaki of the Resource Systems
Institute of Honolulu's East-West Center.
   He looks for an $18 West Texas Intermediate price next
month to trigger a heated OPEC conference when the oil
ministers meet May 25. "We see a sharp rebound after the OPEC
meeting for the month of June," he said.
   Philip K. Verleger Jr., an oil-price authority at the
Washington-based Institute for International Economics, also
sees prices rebounding within a few weeks to $20 or $21 a
barrel for West Texas Intermediate -- but for a different
reason. He said it's very profitable for refiners to build
crude inventories at today's prices and then sell futures.
"It's a great hedging market for the refiners," he said.
"Crude prices will be stronger between now and the end of the
second quarter," he added.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices fell from Friday's gains and ended
near the low of the day. The May contract settled at $1.1670
a pound for a loss of 4.40 cents a pound, slightly above the
day's low of $1.1650. London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks
of copper last week fell to 55,225 tons, down 3,900 tons, the
lowest level since May 1988. But analysts said the figure was
a disappointment to traders who had expected a decline of
between 7,000 and 8,000 tons. Another price-depressing
development, analysts said, was a Reuter news-service report
that quoted Codelco, the Chilean state-owned copper company,
as saying it would produce almost 1.3 million tons of refined
copper this year, a 3.8% improvement from last year. The
company also was reported as saying that 1991 output would
total 1,350,000 tons. Chile is the world's leading copper
producer. Meanwhile, analysts said striking miners and
smelter workers of Southern Peru Copper Corp. rejected the
company's latest offer, continuing the strike that began on
March 12. Peru is the world's sixth-largest copper producer.
Traders seemed to ignore the development, analysts said. One
analyst observed that despite the market's action,
price-supporting underlying factors remain in place. The drop
in London supplies still indicates tight inventories, and the
continuation of the Peruvian strike is also bullish, he said.
At the moment, technically inspired selling appears to
prevail. The analyst noted that the May futures price on
Friday dipped below $1.19 a pound before recovering at the
close, and then fell sharply below that yesterday and failed
to rebound. Another analyst said he felt that traders still
hadn't recovered from the sharp drop that followed
Wednesday's incorrect report that the Peruvian strike had
been settled. "It took some wind out of potential buyers'
sails, and they've remained cautious," he said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold-futures prices declined on the
perception that the dollar will continue to remain strong,
despite expressions of concern about the yen by the major
developed nations after their meeting in Paris during the
weekend. June-delivery gold was off $4.80 an ounce, to
$380.40. May silver fell 6.2 cents an ounce, to $5.1280. July
platinum slipped 90 cents an ounce, to $481.70. European
central banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve yesterday
intervened to support the yen, an analyst said, but traders
regarded this action as mostly aimed to give credibility to
the Group of Seven nations' concern over the Japanese
currency, and it didn't really create gold demand. Another
analyst observed that the G-7 meeting failed to produce
anything concrete that would stem the firmness in the U.S.
currency, "so the dollar is expected to continue to rise."
Some of the selling was by producers, he said. Among
price-depressing factors: The dollar firmed later in the day
and oil prices were sharply weaker. Peter Cardillo,
futures-trading adviser for Josephthal &amp; Co., New York, said
that, with the negative factors currently prevailing in gold,
"there could soon be a test of the $367.00 life-of-contract
low of the June contract."
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Price action remained subdued and
trading volume light ahead of this afternoon's release of two
Agriculture Department reports. The department's report on
world crops is likely to be read especially for its comments
on the soybean harvest in Brazil, a major U.S. competitor in
the export market for soybeans. Another report will detail
U.S. crop supply and demand figures as of April 1. Wheat
futures for May delivery slid 4.5 cents a bushel to close at
$3.6075 a bushel, and May soybean futures declined 3.75 cents
a bushel to close at $5.9175 a bushel. Corn futures for May
delivery gained 0.25 cent a bushel to close at $2.6950 a
bushel.
