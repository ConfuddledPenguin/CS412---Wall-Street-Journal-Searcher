   The future face of affirmative-action policy may be coming
into focus in Pasadena, California. Southern California is
home to tens of thousands of people of Armenian heritage, and
a special Pasadena survey has determined that at least 6,850
of them reside in that town. The $98,000 poll was done
because some in the local Armenian community, which includes
a few highly placed city officials, suspected discrimination
in the broader city work force. So Armenians, at 5.8% of the
population, will be added to the traditional categories --
black, Hispanic, Asian -- in setting quota targets for
hiring. It wouldn't appear, however, that this is a
particularly disadvantaged class -- the same survey placed
the average Armenian household income at $39,000. Also, one
of the Armenian minority, George Deukmejian, is Governor of
the nation's largest state.
