   LANGREO, Spain -- Thanks to taxpayers in France, Germany
and the rest of Europe, towns all around here are getting a
big makeover.
   There's the new $10 million industrial park, for instance.
There is a bridge over the Nalon River, a series of new
roads, a $20 million garbage dump and even a new campsite.
It's all on Europe's tab.

   The wellspring of this largess is the European Regional
Development Fund, a once little-known offshoot of the
European Community's plan to remove most internal trade
barriers by the end of 1992. To smooth out economic
differences among regions -- and get poorer members to agree
to the 1992 single market plan -- the EC doubled the fund's
budget to $68 billion over the next four years. The goal:
Improve lagging infrastructure, like that here in Spain's
Asturias region, to allow more businesses to create more jobs
in areas of chronic unemployment.
   But this money, now fully a quarter of the EC's central
budget, could be just the beginning. As the EC moves beyond
its 1992 program to a more encompassing plan for economic and
monetary union, poorer countries like Spain are demanding
that the development funds be doubled again, to a potentially
budget-busting $140 billion over four years.
   "The 1992 program and the economic and monetary union each
have two parts: the single market and social cohesion," says
Laureano Lazaro Araujo, a Spanish Economics Ministry
official. "If they want to go further, they're going to have
to pay" for the political cooperation of poorer countries
such as Spain.
   EC officials are beginning to acknowledge this fact. While
a recent EC Commission study on the likely impact of a single
European currency predicted more prosperity for everybody,
Bruce Millan, the commissioner in charge of regional policy,
said the effect "will be unequal across regions, even though
it will benefit the community as a whole." The gap between
rich and poor would widen, according to Mr. Millan, and
therefore more money would have to be spent in poorer areas.
   The huge scale of this transfer of wealth has caught the
eyes of the European Community's poorer neighbors. Hungary,
Poland and other Eastern European countries now want
desperately to join the EC, especially if they can also grab
some of the development dollars sloshing around. "From
Hungary we see the gap (in development) increasing between
members and nonmembers," says Ferenc Bartha, former head of
Hungary's central bank. "We want to know the steps and
conditions for us to join, so we can enjoy this aid before
the gap gets too big to ever close."
   Rich non-EC countries, meanwhile, aren't all that thrilled
with the development fund. Switzerland and Sweden, for
example, want closer ties to the European Community and even
contemplate joining one day. But so far they have hesitated,
partly because joining means shelling out huge contributions
to the regional development fund, which wouldn't much help
them. Some EC officials also concede the development projects
don't always live up to expectations and have, on occasion,
turned into an organizational mess.
   But in Spain the EC development funds are vital to a
country running full tilt to secure its place in Europe. The
isolation of the Franco years left Spain with obsolete
industries and never-developed regions. To help redress the
balance, the EC is giving Spain the single biggest percentage
-- 32.6% -- of the money spent in poor regions. Spain is also
getting a fifth of the money spent on redeveloping older
industrial regions (the ravaged north of the United Kingdom
will get 38% of this money).
   Even though the EC funds add up to less than 1% of Spain's
gross national product, they represent 5% to 10% of its
capital spending budget, and for a region like Asturias close
to 13% of all government investment. "This money lets us do
many things we'd never have done, and do the things we would
have had to do anyway, such as roads and sewers, in half the
time," says Vicente Sanchez Alvarez, economic counselor to
the regional government. "But the psychological effect is as
important as the money to convince people that we're not
alone with our future."
   A visit to Asturias shows they indeed aren't alone. Nearly
every highway and construction project is adorned with a sign
bearing the EC's blue and gold flag, signifying an EC
contribution. There's such a sign at the gates to the modern
new garbage dump under construction outside Oviedo, the
region's capital. Santiago Fernandez, an industrial engineer
in charge of garbage hereabouts, proudly shows off the narrow
wooded valley that within 25 years will be entirely filled
with treated refuse from miles around.
   One part of the valley floor is being carefully leveled by
bulldozers before two layers of heavy plastic, with
leak-detecting sensors in between, is laid down to receive
toxic industrial waste. In another part of the dump Mr.
Fernandez shows off a little house filled with computers that
monitor the production of methane gas from household garbage.
The gas powers a turbine and will soon generate enough
electricity for the dump and eventually for nearby homes and
businesses.
   Down the road, another EC billboard stands near the new
bridge over the river Nalon in the mining town of Langreo.
The bridge, and an adjacent new road, will finally end the
hour-long traffic jams that afflict downtown Langreo. They
are part of a broader plan to clean up the Nalon, which at
Langreo runs nearly as black as the coal dug from nearby
hills. "People here claim that 20 years ago there were fish
in this river," says Manuel Gomez, a road engineer. He thinks
that in another 10 years they might be back.
   "Since the coal industry declined, towns like Langreo
really have nothing," explains Belen Menendez Banuelos, a
local government official. "The road and the bridge is at
least something for them."
   Infrastructure improvements like this will also help lure
industry to the blighted area, or so the EC hopes. Jose Luis
San Miguel Cela, director of the Regional Development
Institute in Oviedo, says the region's 12 big companies and
2,000 small ones have long suffered from poor roads, aging
ports and inadequate railroads. Already, the EC projects,
along with local industrial incentives, have drawn investment
to the region from Du Pont Co. of the U.S., Thyssen AG of
Germany and others.
   However, Mr. San Miguel, a big booster of private
development, worries that the EC's efforts can be
counterproductive "if they lead to uncoordinated, slow
decisions on projects that have to be fitted into inflexible
programs decided on in Brussels, not Oviedo." Ideally, he
says, the EC money "will enable private industry to come here
and create real, lasting jobs."
   That's exactly what Jose Manual Perez Diaz is trying to do
at the new $10 million Valnalon industrial park in Langreo,
right next to an EC-funded project to rehabilitate the local
railway line. The project is a classic EC-type development:
It is taking the shell of the old steel mill, which was
founded in 1857 and closed in 1983, and turning it into a
complex for light manufacturing and service companies.
   In one of the building's shed-like workshops two men are
putting the finishing touches on a new, custom-built coal
mining tractor. Upstairs workmen are installing a dozen metal
screens that will house welding workbenches. Down the hall a
sophisticated factory automation training center is already
operating.
   But the Valnalon project also illustrates how costly such
development is: Even after pouring in a billion pesetas ($10
million) over the next few years, the site will employ at
most 2,000 people, less than half the 4,500 steelworkers who
toiled at the old mill at its peak. That's little comfort for
the 10,000 coal miners in Langreo, many of whom will probably
lose their jobs in coming years as more mines close.
   Still, Valnalon, like many EC projects, is a start, says
Mr. Perez. In addition to its other functions, the industrial
park will nurture -- partly through below-market rents -- a
number of small companies that otherwise might never have
been launched. And that, he says, can only benefit Langreo,
Spain -- and Europe.
