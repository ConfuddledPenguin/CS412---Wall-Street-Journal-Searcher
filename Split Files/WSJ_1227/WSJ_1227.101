   Lee A. Gay, an ex-director of Builders Transport Inc.,
said he was advised on Nov. 30 that the board rejected his
request for advance approval to buy 15% or more of Builders
Transport stock.
   Builders, located in Camden, S.C., is a trucking-services
holding company. Mr. Gay holds a 5.2% stake in the company.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Gay said that in the Nov. 30 letter the board said that
it may wish to reconsider the issue if Mr. Gay's holdings
draw near the 15% threshold.
   Mr. Gay responded with a Dec. 21 letter to David C.
Walentas, the chairman of Builders Transport, asking that the
board reconsider his request. Mr. Gay states that "as a
concerned stockholder of BTI, I am of course concerned that
the board act in the best interest of all stockholders."
