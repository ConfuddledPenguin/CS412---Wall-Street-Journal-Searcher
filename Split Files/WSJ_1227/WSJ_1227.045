   DETROIT -- Nissan Motor Corp.'s U.S. sales arm, its
profits pressured by a weakened dollar, raised the base
prices on its 1991 cars and trucks for the second time in
four months.
   The latest increase leaves the base prices on some Nissan
models about 12% higher than in September, the last month of
the auto industry's 1990 model year. The company raised
prices of both Nissan and Infiniti brand models.

   A spokeswoman for Nissan's Infiniti division attributed
the price increase to the weak dollar, which hurts profits on
vehicles Nissan imports from Japan. Though Nissan builds cars
and trucks in Tennessee, it imports most of the vehicles it
sells in the U.S., and also imports major parts for the
vehicles it builds in America.
   "Nissan as a whole continues to watch the yen-dollar
relationship," the spokeswoman said. "Just when you think
it's stable, the needle moves up and down."
   Nissan's price increase follows similar moves by Honda
Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. Those two Japanese auto
makers last month announced their second price rise of the
1991 model year.
   In September, Nissan appeared to be taking a moderate tack
on 1991 price increases. Most of its 1991 models had
base-price increases of 1.7% to 2.7% over the 1990 versions,
although there were exceptions. The Sentra subcompact, which
had been overhauled and given a peppier engine, had a
base-price increase of $600, or 8.1%.
   But the latest increase means that the cheapest version of
the new Sentra will start at $8,290, up $891, or 12%, from
the price of the 1990 model. It's an aggressive move by
Nissan, because the Sentra is in the most competitive and
price-sensitive segment of the car market.
   The new base price for Nissan's Maxima sedan, the
company's best-selling model in the U.S. this year, stands at
$19,375, an increase of $1,276, or 7%, from the 1990 model.
Previously, Nissan had raised the price of the 1991 Maxima by
only 1.7%, to $18,399 from $18,099 on the 1990 model.
   Nissan's luxury-car Infiniti division raised the price of
its Q45 to $40,000. That's up 2.6% from the initial 1991
price of $39,000, and an increase of 5.3% from the 1990-model
price of $38,000. An Infiniti spokeswoman said about $500 of
Q45's increased base price reflects the imminent increase in
the federal "gas guzzler" tax on cars that don't meet minimum
fuel-economy requirements.
   Infiniti also raised the price of its G20 compact sedan to
$17,750, up 1.4% from the initial base price of $17,500 when
the car was launched last spring.
   Infiniti buyers will have to pay more than just higher
base prices. Nissan said it's raising the standard dealer
destination charge on all Infiniti cars to $385 from $350.
   Nissan has struggled in the U.S. car market this year.
While archrivals Honda and Toyota Motor Corp. have increased
their U.S. sales and market share, Nissan's total U.S. car
sales in the first 11 months of the year dropped 12.3% to
423,370 vehicles. The company's share of the car market also
shrank, to 4.9% from 5.3%. Nissan has, however, increased its
truck sales in the U.S. by 9.4% to 156,779 vehicles.
