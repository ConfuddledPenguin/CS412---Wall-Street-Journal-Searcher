   Paramount noted the biggest individual theater receipts
were in several cinema houses in the Los Angeles area, one in
New York and others in Washington, Chicago and Honolulu. But
the biggest single gross was in San Jose, Calif., with more
than $41,000 for a day's showings.
   The first two movies in the trilogy, "The Godfather"
(1972) and "The Godfather Part II" (1974), were among the
biggest money-makers in movie history. Each film won the
Academy Award for best picture.
