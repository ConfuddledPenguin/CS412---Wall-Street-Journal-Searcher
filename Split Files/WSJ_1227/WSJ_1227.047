   NEW YORK -- Hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf helped
spark a strong Treasury bond rally yesterday, although
trading volume was very light.
   Recovering from a severe four-day slump, prices of
long-term Treasury bonds jumped nearly a point, or almost $10
for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bonds fell to 8.28% from 8.36% on Christmas
Eve.

   But corporate bond prices were little changed.
Mortgage-backed bonds rose slightly, and municipals finished
mixed in sluggish trading.
   Short-term interest rates also were mixed. Rates fell
slightly on short-term Treasury bills, while rates soared on
bank certificates of deposit in the secondary, or resale,
markets. Traders said some Japanese banks were paying high
rates to attract short-term money over the next few days to
dress up their balance sheets.
   Many short-term rates may surge even further over the next
few days, traders say, because of a phenomenon known as
"year-end window dressing." This refers to the scramble by
banks and other financial institutions to raise cash in the
money markets to make their balance sheets look more
impressive to investors, depositors and regulators.
   For example, the rate on federal funds, or overnight loans
between banks, sometimes soars around year-end, only to drop
back down shortly after the new year begins. On the final
trading day of 1985, the funds rate jumped to 40% at one
point late in the afternoon. And on the last day of 1986, the
funds rate jumped to 38% at one point, averaging 14.35% for
the day.
   In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues
began surging early in the morning mainly because of Middle
East press reports that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is
preparing a new initiative to present to U.S. officials, and
that a meeting could come soon, several traders here said.
The rally continued even though U.S. officials repeatedly
have said no meeting date has been set.
   Traders also said the rally was bolstered by unexpectedly
strong demand from investors for a record $12.51 billion sale
of new two-year Treasury notes. The average annual yield was
7.32%. Some traders had feared the huge note sale, coupled
with today's auction of new four-year Treasury notes, might
weigh heavily on the markets, driving down bond prices.
   "A surprisingly well-bid auction of two-year Treasury
notes gave a boost to the bond market," said John Lonski,
senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. The
Treasury received bids totaling $38.88 billion for the notes,
or 3.11 times the amount it purchased. He said this figure,
often referred to as the "cover ratio," was up from 2.85 at
the previous auction in November.
   Part of the growing demand for two-year Treasury notes
"can be traced to the increased unwillingness on the part of
banks to lend funds through mortgage and business loan
channels," Mr. Lonski wrote in his daily market summary.
"Unusual bank sensitivity toward credit risk," he wrote, has
led banks to buy short-term Treasury securities, rather than
making some types of loans.
   Traders said the size of yesterday's bond rally was
exaggerated by the lack of trading volume. Many investment
managers already have closed their books for the year.
Trading also was sluggish in the corporate and municipal bond
markets.
   Persian Gulf peace rumors began to fly yesterday after an
Israeli newspaper reported that a date has been set for early
in January for a meeting between Secretary of State James
Baker and Saddam Hussein. After the U.S. State Department
denied that report, Treasury bond prices fell slightly. But
they later climbed again on reports of possible progress in
resolving the crisis.
   "The possibility of war now seems a little less likely
because it seems we may be a little closer to negotiating
with Iraq, and that is what lifted bond prices," said Stuart
G. Hoffman, a vice president at PNC Financial Corp. in
Pittsburgh.
   Some traders called yesterday's rally mainly a technical
rebound, following the sharp four-day drop. During that
period, prices of some issues plunged about 3 1/4 points.
   A government report this morning on November durable goods
orders is widely expected to provide further evidence of the
economy's weakness, leading to further declines in interest
rates next year. According to the average estimate of
economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the
report will show a 2.2% drop in durable goods orders. That
would follow a 3.6% increase in October.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices surged, erasing part of their hefty
losses in the previous four sessions.
   The government's benchmark 30-year bonds, the 8.75% issue
due in 2020, rose to 105 3/32, to yield 8.28%. That was up
sharply from Monday afternoon's price of 104 8/32, where the
yield was 8.36%. The markets were closed Tuesday for
Christmas.
   Treasury bill rates fell, partly reflecting heavy demand
by banks to spruce up their year-end balance sheets. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills declined to 6.48%
from 6.54% late Monday. The bondequivalent yield sank to
6.66% from 6.72%.
   Meanwhile, the difference, or spread, between rates on
Treasury bills and 90-day commercial paper has widened
recently. "Worry over the fortunes of banks and other
financial institutions with substantial exposure to the
troubled real estate sector may partly account for the
greater risk premium now being assessed on commercial paper,"
according to Mr. Lonski of Moody's.
   Mr. Lonski said that in mid-December, the rate on 90-day
prime commercial paper was 7.57%, or about 3/4 of a
percentage point over comparable Treasury bills at that time.
Yesterday, the commercial paper rate was about 8%, or around
1 1/2 percentage points above comparable Treasury bills.
   Demand was brisk yesterday for the new two-year Treasury
notes. The notes, auctioned yesterday by the government at an
average annual yield of 7.32%, were quoted late yesterday in
when-issued trading to yield 7.27%.
   Today, the Treasury is scheduled to sell a record $8.5
billion of new four-year notes. In when-issued trading late
yesterday, these notes yielded 7.67%.
   Here are details of the Treasury's sale of two-year notes
yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated Dec. 31, 1990 and mature Dec. 31,

   Corporate, Junk Securities
                                                                                                       

   Corporate bond prices barely budged yesterday.
   Most investment-grade corporate bonds ended unchanged as
did high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. Trading was extremely
thin as many corporate players were away for the Christmas
holidays and the New Year's celebration.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., in a recent issue of its fixed income
weekly, contended that corporate bonds are looking
increasingly attractive.
   "This quarter, corporate spreads have widened to
compensate investors for the credit risk associated with a
downturn in the business cycle," wrote Thomas Sowanick, chief
fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch. "But, in many
sectors, spreads have reached levels that . . . overstate the
credit and economic risk."
   The spread, or gap between U.S. Treasury bonds and
corporate bonds is a key gauge of investor confidence. In
recent months, as concerns about the economy have grown,
spreads for corporate bonds have widened.
   But Patricia Zlotin, a senior vice president at
Massachusetts Financial Services Co. in Boston, said she
thinks it's too early to buy corporate bonds. "I think
{yields on} a lot of sectors haven't widened out enough to
make them attractive," she said.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Prices of municipal bonds finished mixed in tired trading,
with some issues off as much as 1/4 point and others up as
much as 1/2 point.
   Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 finished 3/8 higher at
98 5/8, with the yield unchanged at Monday's closing level of
7.26%.
