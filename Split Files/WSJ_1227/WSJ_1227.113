   SAN FRANCISCO -- A survey of 250 U.S. manufacturers shows
that while most think the economy is in a recession, an
unusually high percentage nonetheless expect modest profit
growth or at least no earnings decline next year.
   The survey indicates that U.S. manufacturers prepared well
in advance for the economic slowdown, according to the firm
that commissioned the poll, Grant Thornton, a San Francisco
based audit, tax, accounting and management consulting
conern.

   Companies reduced inventories and receivables, started
programs that promised high-yield or short-term paybacks and
invested cautiously, Grant Thornton said. As a result, four
of ten companies expect increased 1991 profits. Another
group, consisting of more than one-third of the respondents,
said they expected earnings about the same as 1990. Only
one-fourth said they expected declining earnings.
   About two-thirds of the companies said the country is in
recession, while another 20% said the nation hasn't yet
entered a downturn but is headed for one in the coming year.
Only eight percent said the likelihood of a recession next
year was dim.
   Manufacturers seem more concerned with the possibility of
inflation cutting into profits than the general downturn.
Four of ten respondents said a higher inflation rate was
likely, while nearly 50% said the rate won't change over the
year. Only 13% said the inflation rate will drop in 1991.
   The telephone survey was conducted between Nov. 26 and
Dec. 4 by the Wirthlin Group, a national opinion research
organization in McLean, Viriginia. The group polled a random
sample of U.S. manufacturers with annual sales between $10
million and $500 million. The firm said the survey has a
margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.
