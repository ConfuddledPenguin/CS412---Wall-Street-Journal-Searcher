   "The Godfather Part III" has been constructed as a formal
ceremony, a reverential homage to its predecessors. The
picture's elegiac mood, its rigorous adherence to the
dictates of pomp and circumstance, make the entire enterprise
seem not so much a movie as a religious service.
Unfortunately, like many religious ceremonies, the content of
this one falls far short of the somber beauty of its physical
surroundings.
   The first two movies in the "Godfather" series deservedly
hold a special place in Hollywood film history. The pictures
potently combined and altered two mainstays of popular
American culture -- the gangster film and the family
melodrama. The director Francis Ford Coppola found in these
stories of the evolution of the Corleone clan the perfect
outlet for his emotional, operatic sensibility. He presented
the Corleone saga as the darkest side of the classic American
success story; the successful immigrants who made good by
doing evil.

   Now, 16 years after "The Godfather Part II," Mr. Coppola
has tried to complete the story with a Shakespearian
flourish. Michael Corleone, the idealistic child of the Mafia
who ultimately became more ruthless than his father, is a man
in his 60s. He's spent the past several years trying to
reconstruct himself as a good man, to leave behind a false,
noble legacy to his children. He's divorced himself from the
underworld and has channeled his money into legitimate
businesses and charities. But he can't escape his past; the
film makers punish him for his sins with stern Old Testament
justice.
   This scenario, devised by Mr. Coppola and his
co-screenwriter, Mario Puzo, is exactly the right way to
conclude the Corleone legend. And Al Pacino's haunted
portrayal of Michael Corleone's confrontation with his past
bristles with a raw honesty. He is a tragic figure; a great
man who devoted his passion and energy to evil and hypocrisy.
Looking haggard and tired, Mr. Pacino brings a powerful,
quiet despair to this portrayal of a wicked person whose
conscience has been reawakened by closer proximity to death.
   Unfortunately, the script betrays its idea and Mr.
Pacino's performance with weak dialogue and ill-conceived
scenes that either play too long or shouldn't have played at
all. The picture feels bloated. Mr. Coppola lays out a series
of lushly conceived settings whose richness only accentuates
the hollowness of the words and actions that take place in
them.
   The beauty of "Godfather II" lay in its originality. It
was a continuation of "The Godfather," but also a textured
movie all on its own. This new "Godfather," however, has all
the weaknesses of the typical sequel. The characters
frequently seem to be explaining what they're doing -- and
how what they're doing relates to the past. Characters from
the earlier movies show up to lecture Michael or to haunt
him. The occasional new and interesting character -- Bridget
Fonda as a reporter, Joe Mantegna as a publicity-hungry
mobster -- are dispensed with all too quickly.
   The "Godfather" series has been particularly compelling
because of the connecting dramas between the Corleone family
and the other family, the Mafia. By the time Part III begins,
the Corleone line has been severed because Michael's own son
has disowned him. So the film makers brought in the
illegitimate son of Sonny, Michael's dead brother, to serve
as heir to the throne. As Vincent the bristly charmer, Andy
Garcia injects some much-needed energy into the mix. However,
even his part is diminished by the script, and more
critically, by a sad casting error.
   Winona Ryder, the young actress who was supposed to play
Michael's daughter Mary, dropped out of the movie and was
replaced by Mr. Coppola's own daughter, Sofia Coppola. This
substitution has a disastrous effect on a crucial moment in
the film's final tragedy, which turns on Michael Corleone's
disapproval of the romance between Mary and Vincent, her
first cousin.
   Ms. Coppola's awkwardness and lack of conventional beauty
might have come off as a bit of charming realism if she were
a gifted actress, or even a competent one. Unfortunately, she
is so uncertain and clumsy that it is impossible to believe
for an instant that a slick operator like Vincent would even
notice her, much less be infatuated with her. When Ms.
Coppola looks at Michael Corleone and says, "Dad, how could
you do this to me?" the line takes on an unintended note of
comedy.
   The picture is, nonetheless, an ambitious undertaking.
Messrs. Coppola and Puzo reshape the Banco Ambrosiano scandal
to forge a link between the Corleone family and the Vatican
in scenes that are satisfactorily portentous. But too often
"Godfather III" is labored and tedious and preachy, like an
old man boring the relatives at a holiday gathering with his
falsified version of his life story.

   After that endlessly sobering experience, it's a pleasure
to indulge in a smart little piece of froth like Woody
Allen's "Alice." The picture's subject matter doesn't sound
like much fun: midlife crisis, adultery, guilt and the moral
erosion brought on by great wealth. But Mr. Allen has
maneuvered through all these things by means of one of the
more likably nondescript movie heroines to come along in a
while.
   Mia Farrow pulls off a marvelous comic turn as Alice, a
rich man's wife who's thoroughly bored and ashamed of her
dull, pampered life. Mr. Allen's sly portrayal of the very
rich in New York is amusing, as is Alice's loopy journey to
self-awareness.

   VIDEO TIP: All the "Godfather" freaks out there have
probably already prepared for Part III by watching either the
separate or the combined versions of the first two chapters.
To complete the picture, take a look at "The Freshman" when
it comes out on video a month or two from now. Marlon
Brando's self-parody of his Don Corleone is priceless.
