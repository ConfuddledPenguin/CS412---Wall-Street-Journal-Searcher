   NEW YORK -- Can the stock market keep climbing on interest
rate cuts?
   Last week, when the Federal Reserve knocked the discount
rate it charges on loans to financial institutions down to
6.5% from 7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average immediately
leaped 33 points. But for the rest of the week, the Dow
industrials were only able to add six points. The stock
market's response to recent rate cuts has been muted, at
best.

   Further interest rate cuts are likely to result in one-day
boosts in stocks. But investors can't count on a broad,
extended stock-market rally based on rate declines alone,
analysts say. For stocks to rally, investors will have to be
convinced that interest rate cuts will get corporate profits
growing again.
   Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu in New
York, agrees with most analysts that short-term rates are
headed lower; he says the bellwether federal funds rate that
banks charge each other on overnight loans could drop to 6%
by July from the current 7%. But the Fed will reduce rates
further because of surprising weakness in the economy, he
says.
   Mr. Fabbri continues: "I think this recession is going to
be fairly deep, and the normal response {in the economy} to
interest-rate cuts may be more muted this time. That means it
will take longer to get things moving again and thus deeper
rate cuts than you might expect."
   That kind of economy won't be a favorable environment for
either corporate earnings or stock prices, he says. "In the
kind of weak economy I'm talking about, a drop in short-term
rates to 6% from 7% won't generate much in the way of
corporate profits, and therefore the outlook for stocks isn't
very good."
   Typically, a rate reduction by the Federal Reserve has an
immediate impact on stock prices. When yields drop on
money-market investments and bonds, stocks become relatively
more attractive. Earlier this year, when the Fed attempted to
engineer an economic "soft landing" (moderating inflation and
declining interest rates) by lowering interest rates, the Dow
industrials climbed to nearly 3000.
   But after the Fed cuts short-term rates, a guessing game
begins. What impact will rates have on consumer spending?
What impact will lower rates have on corporate profits six
months from now?
   For one thing, Mr. Fabbri cautions investors to look
beyond just short-term interest rates, which are the only
ones that the Fed can directly influence. "When you think
about stocks, you have to think about both short-term and
long-term interest rates," he says. "Short-term rates provide
liquidity and credit and are a sign of what the Fed is trying
to do, but long-term {bond} rates provide an alternative
investment to stocks."
   He thinks because of concerns about the Middle East,
yields on long-term Treasury bonds won't be falling nearly as
fast as short-term rates, thus making bonds a more attractive
investment option than stocks.
   Indeed, asset allocators -- who switch big pools of money
between stocks, bonds and cash -- say that stocks are not
cheap relative to bonds, but only fairly valued at current
prices. And many of these investors are not buying stocks
aggressively because they are afraid of bad earnings
surprises that can torpedo stocks.
   "We think stocks and bonds are relatively equal, but the
risk is that earnings could be revised" lower still, says
Michael Leavy, investment analyst at QuantiLogic Asset
Management Co., an asset allocation firm. The firm's $1.4
billion in investments has about 25% less stocks than normal.
   Overseas investors, meanwhile, may shy away from stocks
because of continued worry about the dollar's weakness.
Midland's Mr. Fabbri thinks these global investors won't be
much interested in owning either U.S. stocks or bonds. That
would eliminate a key source of demand for stocks that could
help to bolster prices.
   Like the asset allocators, however, Mr. Fabbri thinks
stocks are about fairly valued currently.
   "I would argue that we might not go up from here, but we
probably won't go down a lot either," he says. "A big drop
would depend on some worsening of the Middle East situation
or some worsening of the financial problems being exposed at
banks and insurance companies."
   Not everyone thinks the outlook for stocks is stagnant.
Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
says investors should ready their buy list for stocks
sometime in early spring.
   Sure, corporate profits are going to get worse from here.
Merrill Lynch is forecasting a 16.1% decline in average
earnings per share for the stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index in the first quarter of 1991, compared to the
year-earlier period. Earnings for the second quarter of 1991
should be down 28.3%, Merrill Lynch says.
   But by the end of the second quarter, lower interest rates
will begin to take effect, the firm says. Merrill Lynch is
forecasting an 11.5% increase in earnings for S&amp;P 500 stocks
in the third quarter.
   "I think earnings are going to hit a trough in 1991 in the
second quarter," says Mr. Straszheim. "The history is that
the equity market has turned up at least four months prior to
the trough," which means investors should look for the stock
market to turn up in early March, he says.
   Edward S. Hyman, vice chairman of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell, is so convinced that stocks need lower interest
rates that he has argued for years that "good news" about the
economy is really "bad news" for stocks.
   That's why when he arranges various newspaper clippings on
the front of his weekly strategy newsletter, Mr. Hyman puts
items about rising unemployment and plunging retail sales on
the "good news" side. Articles about rebounding factory
orders and moderating wholesale prices go on the "bad news"
side. He thinks that the stock market "is better served by
the economy getting weaker, resulting in further lowering of
interest rates."
   Mr. Hyman's views on what is and isn't good for stocks
harks back to the economic rebound that began in 1988. "The
economy came back and really started to go up," he recalls.
"Federal funds began a march to 9 3/4% from 8%. The better
the economy got, the worse it was for stocks. Higher interest
rates were more than offsetting any good feeling you got from
earnings."
   Now, of course, the federal funds rate has marched right
back down past 8%, as the Fed has been pushing down
short-term rates.
   That isn't to say Mr. Hyman hasn't been tempted to change
his view of what's good for stocks. After all, at some point
bad news becomes bad news.
   What ultimately will get stocks launched on a big rally,
he says, is for conditions to get so bad that the Fed opens
the monetary floodgates to get the economy back on its feet.
"What really gets the stock market going is when the Fed
injects reserves into the system," he says. "So far, they've
just been holding reserves steady."
