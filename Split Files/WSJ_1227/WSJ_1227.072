   After months of negotiations, Concurrent Computer Corp.
said it reached an agreement with the majority of its bank
lenders toward a restructuring of senior debt.
   The Tinton Falls, N.J., company said it is also in
negotiations with bondholders to restructure its subordinated
debt.

   The provider of high-performance computer systems said it
will reduce its principal owed by $1.9 million, part of a
payment due last September. In turn, the banks agreed not to
take any action to enforce payment owed before Feb. 1. The
company said its banks have committed to working closely with
it to achieve a debt restructuring agreement before the Feb.
1 deadline.
   Company officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   Concurrent has been involved in negotiations with its bank
group after it missed two payments due Sept. 15 and Sept. 28.
