   Donald Trump is running out of money again, but he's not
particularly worried about it.
   The $65 million his bankers lent him in August is almost
depleted. Trump Organization as a whole isn't making any
money, and plenty is leaving it to pay for Mr. Trump's life
style and employee salaries.

   Unless there is a cash infusion by midspring, Mr. Trump's
advisers and bankers say, he will once again have no money to
keep his operations going.
   "He either files for bankruptcy or makes another deal with
his banks," says a banker from one of Mr. Trump's largest
lending institutions. "So far, it's not clear which way it
will go."
   Mr. Trump's 1990s setbacks haven't put a dent in his
1980s-style self-assurance. He has confided to associates
that he is certain the banks will lend more money, since his
bankruptcy still would be worse for them than for him. He
speaks of deals about to happen that will get him out of his
debt trap, much as he boasted in April, right before banks
came to his rescue, that he planned to become "the king of
cash."
   "Mark my words," he said in a recent interview. "In 12
months I will be worth more than I was two years ago."
   To reach that goal, a series of events bordering on
miracles would have to transpire. By June 15, Mr. Trump faces
the probability of having to restructure the bond debt of
both the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza Atlantic City casinos.
He is in default on $245 million in bank debt secured by his
Trump Shuttle airline, and could lose that asset any time the
banks choose to fight him for it.
   He is in default on a bank loan secured by his Trump Plaza
of the Palm Beaches project, and is fighting with the New
York state attorney general to prevent dozens of purchasers
of his $220 million Trump Palace condominium from rescinding
their contracts; associates say Mr. Trump has even discussed
removing his name from the building.
   And, contrary to what was forecast under his bank rescue
last summer, he has not sold a single major asset. His yacht
has sailed from port to port in the Far East to Europe,
searching to no avail for a buyer. Mr. Trump continues to
speak about selling a half-share in New York City's Plaza
Hotel for $800 million.
   In short, 1991 is shaping up as every bit as difficult as
1990 was for Mr. Trump. His nagging problems stem from the
fact that while the banks gave him some time, they didn't
forgive a penny of the $2 billion in principal he owes them.
Of that amount, about $800 million is personally guaranteed;
if he sells an asset for less than he paid for it, he will
continue to owe his lenders whatever the shortfall is.
   Although the personal guarantees weigh down his ability to
recover, there are a number of scenarios under which Mr.
Trump could recoup his lost wealth. His advisers are working
on a complex refinancing of the Trump Shuttle under which Mr.
Trump would be released both from his $245 million equity and
his $135 million unsecured loans. Both were made from
Citibank, which then syndicated them to other lenders.
   Trump Organization is also working toward getting expanded
zoning to develop 72 acres of rail yards on Manhattan's Upper
West Side. That project has been fought tooth and nail by
local residents, and is almost certain to be fought in the
courts for years to come. If the zoning is approved, "the
site becomes worth a billion dollars," Mr. Trump says. "In an
up real estate market, it's more like 1.5 billion."
   If Mr. Trump sounds as though he is still immune from the
laws of financial gravity, he has his reasons. On more than
one occasion over the past year, he has proved his critics
wrong by snatching victory from the jaws of bankruptcy.
   In August, after his lenders were stunned to learn Trump
Organization had a projected negative cash flow of over $100
million, close to 90 banks signed off on a deal to give him
money and time to work out his problems, and deferral of
interest payments on half of his $2 billion in bank debt.
   And last month, after Taj Mahal bondholders vowed not to
let Mr. Trump keep control of the casino after he defaulted
on the debt, he persuaded them to do just that.
   His business brinkmanship has coincided with disruptions
in his personal life. He's been divorced, and is now
photographed frequently with a variety of dates on his arm.
He's added some pounds -- associates say he has a weakness
for a chocolate cake from Cakemasters -- and a few gray
hairs. But he also spends many evenings alone, eating dinner
in bed, watching television and talking to associates on the
phone.
   When he does appear in public, he is still treated like a
star, a fact that isn't lost on his bankers and bond holders.
"From our side, we have no idea whether this guy is the
greatest thing since sliced bread or an Edsel," says Robert
Miller, an attorney with Berlack Israels &amp; Liverman who
represents Taj Mahal bond holders. "But you would be amazed
at the celebrity value of this guy's name, even today."
   But, having invited the public spotlight in happier times,
he now says he wishes the media would turn it toward other
targets. "I'm a private guy. The newspapers shouldn't be
doing a story a day on Donald Trump," he says. "There are
other developers out there, and they're getting killed much
worse than I am."
   But while others have fallen over the past year, few have
dropped from as high a perch as Mr. Trump. Gone are the days
when Mr. Trump could walk into a bank office and receive a
$100 million line of credit on a personal guarantee, as he
did in December 1988 with Bankers Trust. Even as late as
April, after news of Mr. Trump's financial troubles were
widely reported, he drew down the final $25 million of the
Bankers Trust loan.
   Gone, too, are the days when Mr. Trump could make a
purchase based on nothing more than a gut feeling. That's
pretty much what happened in 1986 when Mr. Trump learned of a
twin-tower luxury condominium project in West Palm Beach
whose developer had defaulted on $94 million in obligations.
   As he toured the property, an aide suggested that
purchasing the twin-tower development, even for the price of
$41 million, might not be the best idea, given the cost
overruns and its distance from Mr. Trump's home base in New
York.
   Then, according to a version told by two people close to
Trump Organization, Mr. Trump held up his hand magisterially
and knocked on the sheet rock walls. "Don't tell me about
construction," he said. "I know great construction when I see
it and this is great construction."
   As it turns out, the building wasn't constructed
particularly well. Nor did the project, which came to be
known as Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches, sell particularly
well. Last week, Mr. Trump was forced by project lender
Marine Midland Bank to auction 35 apartments at as little as
40% of their asking prices.
   Despite such setbacks and the likelihood that tough
financing negotiations lie ahead, Mr. Trump sounds as though
he could go another 12 rounds with his bankers and not even
work up a sweat. "It's in the genes, I really believe that,"
he says. "A lot of guys would have gone into a corner and put
their thumbs in their mouths. I'm a fighter."
   Says his chief financial officer, Stephen Bollenbach: "If
he gets buried by mountains of debt, and keeps shoveling and
nothing happens, it seems to me that he could lose heart at
some point."
   But, Mr. Bollenbach adds: "So far, he hasn't."
