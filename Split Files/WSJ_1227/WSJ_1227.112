   SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Telesis Group will reserve $60
million against fourth-quarter earnings to offset losses it
expects as it sheds its real estate holdings.
   The reserve equals 15 cents a share. For 1989's fourth
quarter, the telecommunications company reported net income
of $322 million, or 79 cents a share, on $2.48 billion of
revenue.

   In March, Pacific Telesis's PacTel Corp. subsidiary said
it no longer would invest capital in PacTel Properties, its
real estate unit. And recently, Pacific Telesis announced a
reorganization under which it said it would slash staff
overhead in its domestic cellular operations and position
itself to respond more readily to wireless communication and
home entertainment opportunities world-wide.
   Pacific Telesis said it will shed PacTel Properties'
portfolio, consisting of properties in California and
Florida, over the next few years.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pacific Telesis shares rose 12.5 cents to $45.75.
