   PATEEKA, Pakistan -- The battalion minivan skids to a stop
on the edge of a roadside cliff above the Neelum River,
surging with white water hundreds of feet below. Four
Pakistani soldiers bound out of the van with folding chairs,
binoculars, maps and soft drinks.
   It's time for the "Indian aggression" briefing. Capt.
Shahid Ahmed, company commander in Pakistan's 7th Northern
Light Infantry, points across the river and says, "Their
chaps opened fire from those bunkers, hitting five of our
chaps."

   Capt. S. Qasim Shah, an army public relations officer,
doesn't like what he hears. He didn't bounce for three hours
over a mountain road from Muzaffarabad to hear the enemy
referred to as "their chaps." He interrupts: "The enemy shot
and badly wounded five innocent Pakistani civilians. It was a
bloody act of totally unprovoked Indian aggression."
   Indian aggression, be it theoretical or actual, is
important to Pakistan. It is pivotal to Pakistan's sense of
self-importance and relevance in the region, a sense that has
been shaken in recent months by the suspension of U.S. aid
and the Soviet-U.S. agreement to cut off arms and money to
neighboring Afghanistan's warring factions. For more than a
decade, Pakistan served as a funnel through which the U.S.
poured $300 million annually in arms and aid to Moslem
guerrillas fighting the Soviet-supported Afghan government.
   Without the Afghan war, Pakistan needs another role.
Leaders in Islamabad see their nation as a key player in any
Persian Gulf post-crisis peacekeeping. In the meantime,
Pakistan does its best to focus attention on its 43-year-old
conflict with India.
   That has never been easy. Over three wars, in 1947, 1965
and 1971, India and Pakistan have reminded the world that
their mutual 1,200-mile-long border is a cut that won't heal.
They were on the verge of war again last spring, this time
with each country, as local journalists like to put it,
within "a screwdriver turn" of having nuclear weapons. That
got everybody's attention, but Saddam Hussein snatched it
away on Aug. 2 by invading Iraq.
   Mammoth India never fades long from consciousness. But
Pakistan is another story. It has a new prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif, who defeated Benazir Bhutto in an election this fall,
and he has his hands full trying to govern 110 million
people, three out of four of whom can't read or write and
most of whom are landless laborers earning less than $400 a
year.
   But these days men like Capt. Qasim have the toughest jobs
in Pakistan: He and men like him have the increasingly
quixotic task of garnering the world's attention, sympathy
and support for a nation that spends 52% of its national
budget on defense, fuels violence in adjacent India and works
tirelessly to develop nuclear weapons. The U.S. Congress
recently froze $573 million in military and economic aid over
reports of Pakistan's continued persuit of the atomic bomb.
   Capt. Qasim escorts visiting journalists to one of the
world's great flashpoints: the cease-fire line between India
and Pakistan in Kashmir. It is known officially as the Line
of Control. It divides Azad Kashmir, a semiautonomous
Pakistani state, and Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian state. The
Iron Curtain has melted away with the Cold War. But this
line, older and longer than the demilitarized zone that
divides Korea, remains, a symbol of hate and intransigence.
   The message here is simple: Pakistan is still important in
a world that doesn't seem to be paying attention; Pakistani
jawans, enduring hardships, fend off Indian army hordes.
After high-altitude artillery duels in September, the
Pakistan army announced success in "shattering Indian
arrogance."
   Before 1971, Pakistan was considered important on grounds
of size alone. It was the world's fifth most-populous nation.
But in a war with India that year, it lost East Pakistan and
dropped to ninth in the population standings, right behind
Bangladesh, the nation created out of territory it lost.
   During the Cold War, Pakistan positioned itself as a
pro-Western bulwark "squeezed between two militant neighbors,
superpower Russia to the north and India, an aspirant to that
status, in the east," in the words of one writer. Today both
India and the Soviet Union are preoccupied with internal
disintegration.
   The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 put
Pakistan on the map again. With U.S. and Saudi Arabian
billions, it funneled military hardware to Afghan mujahideen
insurgents. But the Soviets left almost two years ago,
Afghanistan is being called the forgotten war, and the
Pakistan funnel is drying up.
   From November 1988 to last August, Pakistan was notable
for being the first Islamic state to have a female prime
minister. Benazir Bhutto was popular in the West, too --
being young, female and educated at Harvard and Oxford. She
also was unusual for heading one of only four elected
governments in Pakistan's history-military dictators have
ruled Pakistan for more than 25 of its 43 years.
   Capt. Qasim has the task of telling visiting journalists
what Pakistan isn't doing. The Pakistani military isn't
fueling the uprisings in the Indian side of Kashmir and the
Punjab, he says. And it has no connection, he says, to the
two main Kashmir liberation groups with headquarters in
Muzaffarabad, where he also lives. Diplomatic sources say
Pakistan has withheld support to the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation
Front, which seeks independence, and supports the Hezbul
Mujahideen, which wants all of Kashmir to be part of
Pakistan.
   "Hezbul is our fighting force," says Sheikh
Aqeel-ur-Rehman, a 34-year-old lawyer and president of
Jamati-e-Islami in Muzaffarabad. Not only doesn't it get help
from the Pakistan military, it has had big trouble getting
ammunition for its fighters, he says, adding: "We appeal to
all freedom-loving peoples and peace-loving countries in
helping us with ammunition."
   Sheikh Aqeel says Hezbul's goal is to turn Kashmir into
the next Afghanistan and he says his group looks forward to
welcoming the Afghan mujahideen to fight alongside them. "It
is possible we may capture some parts of Kashmir by force,"
he says. The Afghan mujahideen want to send guns, ammo and
fighters "but the Pakistan government doesn't allow."
   Also in Muzaffarabad is Amanullah Khan, 57-year-old
chairman of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. His house is
guarded by young men with machine guns and full of young
Kashmiris and their sleeping bags. "Refugees," he says with a
wink. "All right, we do it," he says when asked about border
crossings. Weapons smuggling? "We do it."
   Sometimes, even Pakistan's friends are bad for its image.
The secretary-general of the India-Pakistan Friendship
Society is Satish Kumar, a college professor in New Delhi,
India's capital. The organization promotes friendship between
the two countries, but that doesn't mean it has to play down
Pakistan's faults.
   "Over the years of prolonged military rule, an entrenched
group of officers has developed deep interests in the
economy," says Prof. Kumar. "Granting licenses for drug
trafficking is most lucrative for them. This business is very
directly protected by the military establishment."
   Pakistan aid for Kashmir is "low-cost troublemaking," he
says. "They don't want to end it. It doesn't cost much."
