   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- More than 600 state employees were to
put in their last day of work yesterday as the Cuomo
administration went ahead with layoff plans to help eliminate
an estimated $1 billion deficit in the state's $50 billion
budget.
   Included among the 619 employees to be fired were about
300 prison guards and 300 other prison workers.

   James Flateau, Gov. Mario Cuomo's spokesman on criminal
justice issues, said yesterday that no problems had been
reported at the prisons because of layoffs.
   On Christmas Eve, the leadership of Council 82, the prison
guards' union, met with Corrections Commissioner Thomas
Coughlin to discuss the layoffs amid speculation that guards
were considering a strike or some other protest.
   Union President Thomas Kennedy said no strike had been
called.
   While he was reluctant to talk about union sentiment
regarding some form of protest to the guard layoffs and other
cost-cutting actions, he warned that anxiety among guards was
running high. He called for intervention by Mr. Cuomo.
   "The last time we saw this type of dissatisfaction. . . .,
there was a strike in 1979," Mr. Kennedy said.
   At that time, then-Gov. Hugh Carey called the National
Guard to run the prisons during a 16-day strike by prison
guards upset over negotiations for a new contract.
   "We've done everything possible to avert these layoffs,
but nobody is listening at the (state) Capitol," Mr. Kennedy
said after the Monday meeting.
   Mr. Flateau said yesterday that Mr. Cuomo has been
involved in layoff discussions. "It's disingenuous to say the
governor has not been involved," Mr. Flateau said.
   Other state workers putting in their last day yesterday
included 12 employees at the state Division of Parole and
seven Commission on Correction employees.
   In all, 2,000 state workers are to be laid off by the end
of the fiscal year on March 31. Mr. Cuomo has promised to
eliminate 4,000 additional jobs through attrition and early
retirement incentives. Next year, the governor has said, he
may have to eliminate 12,000 more jobs.
   The state has more than 200,000 employees.
   Twenty-three more layoffs will take effect Jan. 2. Those
cuts are at the Division of Criminal Justice Services, the
Division of Military and Naval Affairs and the Department of
State, said a spokeswoman for the Governor's Office of
Employee Relations.
