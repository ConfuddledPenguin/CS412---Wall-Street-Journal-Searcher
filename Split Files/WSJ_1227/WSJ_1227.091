   Bidermann Industries Corp. said its Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co.
unit sold the "Colours by Alexander Julian" license and
existing business to Collection Clothing Corp.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but Bidermann, based in New York,
said Collection Clothing would get the U.S. rights to
production and distribution of the licensed sportswear,
outerwear, dress shirts and neckwear designed by Alexander
Julian. Guido Petruzzi, Bidermann's president, said the sale
was part of a plan to focus on Cluett's shirt business.

   Bidermann said Collection Clothing is a joint venture of
Alexander Julian and Aeneas Venture Corp., an affiliate of
Harvard Management Group. Bidermann, major maker and
distributor of apparel under various brand and designer
names, is a unit of Bidermann S.A. of France. It acquired
Cluett for $350 million last March from distressed investor
William Farley, who needed to sell assets of West
Point-Pepperell Inc. after he acquired the textile company in
a leveraged buy-out.
