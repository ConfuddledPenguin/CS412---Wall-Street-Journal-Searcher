   The first time V.S. Naipaul went to India, in 1962, he was
just 30 years old, a writer not yet famous, not yet
financially secure.
   His trip resulted in "An Area of Darkness," a dazzling
travel book of acute observation and sharp-edged comment,
colored by the shock and disappointment that the
Trinidad-born writer felt in the country of his ancestors. In
a nation that many Westerners and even greater numbers of
privileged Indians believed possessed of a spiritual light
deserving respect from less-enlightened parts of the world,
Mr. Naipaul found darkness. The book outraged those devotees
of the cult of India's spiritual superiority -- all the more
so because it awakened others to the prevalence of cant and
cruelty in the land of Gandhi and Nehru. The enormous impact
of "An Area of Darkness" greatly enhanced Mr. Naipaul's
reputation.

   That first encounter was much in Mr. Naipaul's thoughts
when he set out in 1988 on another long visit to India. His
timing was good because since independence in 1947 India has
never been so prosperous, nor so troubled. On the one hand,
India has left behind its early beggarly dependence and
created a large middle class that, in turn, is the engine of
a consumer-spending boom. On the other, violence is rising
from Kashmir to Assam and only the Soviet Union faces more
separatist challenges to central government control.
   It seems a perfect moment for Mr. Naipaul's latest report.
But, "India: A Million Mutinies Now" (Viking, 521 pages,
$24.95) disappoints. Mr. Naipaul is no longer a young writer
on a tight budget. He stays in the best hotels and travels
with hired car and driver. Something also has changed in Mr.
Naipaul's nonfiction.
   His new book on India follows "A Turn in the South," his
unoriginal, shallow look at the southern U.S. Mr. Naipaul now
seems uninclined to edit his material or allow others to do
so. As a result, the distinguished writer crams "India" with
overlong portraits of one Indian after another -- some
interesting, some not. Often he includes his questions as
well as the answers as though every word were important. At
its worst, "India" is like reading the transcripts of Bill
Moyers dialogues -- including the outtakes. It is earnest,
respectful, high-minded, but to no purpose.
   For almost four-fifths of this lengthy book, Mr. Naipaul
is content to keep his tape recorder running while his mind
idles. Once in a while he slips it into gear and, as one
would expect, out pops an arresting insight. But as he
travels through Bombay, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Calcutta he seems
determined not to explain what he thinks all his interviews
add up to.
   It's an old joke in journalism to hand an editor an
overlong story with the explanation: "I'm sorry, I didn't
have time to write it short." The point is that to write
short you have to know what your story is about. To write
clearly, you have to know what you think. For hundreds of
pages, Mr. Naipaul tempts the reader to conclude that he no
longer knows what he thinks about India.
   A murmur of apology runs through "India." The shock and
humiliation that the young Naipaul felt upon first
encountering the land that had long been so important in his
imagination has given way to a mellower view in the mind of
the middle-aged man. His youthful attitude he now calls "old
nerves" and seems to reproach himself for having been in 1962
"a fearful traveller." His disappointment, he writes now,
resulted from his having naively cherished "the idea of the
family of India." Indians didn't share such an illusion, he
knows now. The idea of an all-inclusive fellowship of man is
mocked daily in Indian life by caste, clan and religious
clashes.
   Today, Mr. Naipaul argues that the last 90 years of
British rule (after the mutiny) and the 40-plus years of
India's independence have been a time of regeneration in
which the idea of freedom has reached all Indians, bringing
self-awareness and strength.
   At last, when Mr. Naipaul reaches Lucknow, the Punjab and
Kashmir in the final sections of his book, he slips his mind
into gear and writes with some of the provocative keenness of
vision found in his earlier works. But his analysis leads him
to a dubiously wishful conclusion.
   Although separatist tendencies make headlines today, and
although India may not be the family of his youthful dreams,
he argues it has become a nation. The million little mutinies
of his subtitle are not cause for great alarm, only symptoms
of the rage that accompanies a liberation of the spirit, he
writes in words that would have saved him so many brickbats
had he written them in 1962. "The Indian Union was greater
than the sum of its parts; and many of these movements of
excess strengthened the Indian state, defining it as the
source of law and civility and reasonableness," he adds.
   The mutinies, like those in which Moslems and Hindus kill
each other in Kashmir or Sikhs and Hindus kill each other in
Punjab, are seen as a positive phenomenon: "They were part of
the beginning of a new way for many millions, part of India's
growth, part of its restoration."
   It would be nice to think Mr. Naipaul is right.
