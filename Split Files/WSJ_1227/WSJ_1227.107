   Analysts' estimates that Wet Seal Inc. will earn 80 cents
a share for the fiscal year ending Feb. 2 "may be overly
optimistic by as much as 10 to 12 cents," president Ken
Chilvers said.
   Mr. Chilvers said lackluster holiday sales, particularly
in southern California, required the Irvine, Calif., retailer
of women's apparel to mark down merchandise earlier than
planned.

   In the year-earlier period, before the company's initial
public offering, Wet Seal earned $5.9 million on sales of
$78.7 million. For the 39 weeks ended Nov. 3, the company had
net income of $6 million, or 56 cents a share, on sales of
$79 million.
   Despite the disappointing holiday results, Wet Seal plans
to build 20 new stores during 1991, mostly in Florida, Mr.
Chilvers added. He noted that the company's five existing
stores in Florida, which opened this year, "have continued to
exceed sales projections."
