   One hundred years after the death of Heinrich Schliemann,
another German archaeologist is leading an international team
of 50 archaeologists, scientists and historians in a new
campaign to answer the fascinating questions raised by
Schliemann at Troy. He became famous as the man who
discovered and excavated the Homeric cities of Troy and
Mycenae between 1870 and his death in December 1890, and
became the father of Aegean prehistoric archaeology.
   In this anniversary year, Prof. Manfred Korfmann of
Tubingen University in West Germany, who is 48 years old, as
was Schliemann when he started digging at Troy in 1870, has a
Turkish permit to excavate the many levels of habitation at
Troy that span nine major periods carbon-dated back to about
3000 B.C. This fabled fortress lies six hours southwest of
Istanbul by bus or car at the southern entrance to the
Dardanelles on the Aegean coast of northwest Turkey.

   Under Mr. Korfmann's direction, German and Turkish
archaeologists are concentrating on Bronze Age remains of the
walled citadel of Troy from about 3000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.
(Troy I through VII). A team of American archaeologists led
by Stella Miller-Collett and Brian Rose of the University of
Cincinnati are digging outside the walls for remains of
classical and Hellenistic Greek reoccupation of Ilion from
about 700 B.C. to 85 B.C. (Troy VIII), and Roman imperial
rebuilding of Ilion from 85 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Troy IX). There
are also British, Austrian, Mexican and Danish scientists and
scholars working at Troy.
   In addition to the traditional archaeologists and ancient
historians, there are geologists and chemists core-drilling
in the plains and bays below Troy to map the ancient contours
of the coastline; there are geologists and physicists with
magnetometers mapping the streets and walls of the
unexcavated city outside the citadel of Troy; and there are
scientists using thermoluminescence to analyze the dates and
the chemical content of clay pottery, and the nature of food
or wine or oils stored in that pottery.
   There are paleozoologists studying bones found at Troy,
man and mammal; physical anthropologists studying human
skeletons; numismatists looking at coins; epigraphers
studying inscriptions; architectural historians drawing maps
of ancient buildings and streets; and computer experts trying
to organize all this new information in a computerized data
bank.
   I visited Troy just before the third year of current
excavations got under way in June. Mr. Korfmann, who got
hooked on archaeology during a postgraduate motorcycle tour
of the Middle East, enthusiastically explained some of the
old controversies he and his colleagues hope to find
archaeological evidence for or against.
   1. Is Homer's eighth century B.C. epic poem about a
10-year war between Mycenaean Greeks and Trojans a
magnificent myth, or is it based on historical events of the
Bronze Age 13th century B.C.? There is considerable
archaeological evidence for Mycenaean Greek activities and
some settlements on the Aegean coast of Turkey in the 15th to
13th centuries B.C., but no proof that the Trojan War of the
Iliad took place or ended with the destruction of Troy. The
exact date is even more elusive.
   2. Is Homer a historical person? Did he create the 24
books of the Iliad and the Odyssey himself, or collect and
recite stories told by traveling poets for 500 years before?
Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the essential historic
truth of Homer's story of the Greek siege and destruction of
Troy in the Iliad; and the founding of Rome by Aeneas, one of
the few surviving nobles of Troy, as told by Virgil in the
Aeneid. These stories were part of a classical education in
antiquity. In fifth century B.C. Greece and later in
antiquity, Homer was believed to be a blind Ionian poet,
perhaps from Smyrna or the Island of Chios, who composed the
story of the Iliad in about 730 B.C. and the Odyssey later,
around 700 B.C. Today, he is considered part of an oral
tradition of many poets reciting from memory the first great
epic of Western literature.
   3. Is the high mound of Hissarlik on the fertile plains
south of the modern Turkish town of Canakkale the site of the
"horserich," "windy" Troy described by Homer? Most scholars
think it must be Troy because it fits Homer's description
well and has so many stratified levels of habitation and
pottery. In antiquity Troy must have been 66 feet high from
bedrock -- "steepwalled" to be sure. This summer, the
German-Turkish team excavated two palatial buildings of Troy
II -- about 2500 B.C. -- built of two-foot-long mud bricks
and large square wooden beams. Atop the citadel of Troy, they
suggest this was an important power center more than 1,000
years before the Mycenaeans came from Greece.
   4. Where did the fabled 1,030 ships of the Greek fleet led
by Agamemnon of Mycenae land when they began the siege of
Troy, if they did what Homer tells us in the Iliad? Mr.
Korfmann's excavations from 1982 to 1987 around Besik Bay on
the Aegean coast southwest of Troy have convinced many
scholars that the Greek fleet would have drawn up its ships
on the flat, sandy beaches of what was in the 13th century
B.C. a much deeper bay, closer to the fortress of Troy, about
3.4 miles away. The previous assumption was that the Greek
fleet of the Iliad landed at the mouth of the Skamander River
directly north of Troy, inside the southeast entrance to the
Dardanelles in what was a bay with a river delta. Mr.
Korfmann argues persuasively that the strong five-knot
southward current of Black Sea water funneling through the
mouth of the Dardanelles near Troy, and the steady northwest
winds averaging 10 miles an hour down the straits of the
Dardanelles, would have made it very difficult for Mycenaean
Greek ships to sail up into the Dardanelles to the mouth of
the Skamander. They were fitted only with oars and sails and
had no deep keels needed to sail against the wind.
   5. How extensive were the streets, houses, shops and
temples of the Lower City outside the walls of Troy in the
13th century B.C., at the time of the Trojan War (the
so-called late Troy VI and VII)? How large was the new city
of Ilion, built and inhabited from the 12th to eighth
centuries B.C., through the Dark Ages to the Archaic Period
around 700 B.C. (Troy VIII)? And how much more prosperous did
Ilion become as a trading center and sacred site under the
patronage of Romans from 85 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Troy IX)?
   American classical archaeologists led by Ms.
Miller-Collett and Mr. Rose are exploring the fields south of
the citadel of Troy with magnetometric sounding and mapping,
and digging test trenches that are revealing a larger
settlement in later Greek and Roman times than was previously
suspected. This is breaking new ground, raising new questions
and hopes for answers to some of the riddles of Troy. This
summer, Ms. Miller-Collett cleared a sanctuary in the Lower
City with altars showing more religious activity and
continuous habitation from 1000 B.C. to the birth of Christ
than was previously imagined. Mr. Rose uncovered part of a
large Roman villa or glass factory of the fourth century A.D.
with painted walls, colored marble floors and a small marble
head of the god of health, Asclepius.
   Beyond the digging and publishing of their discoveries in
a new journal, Studia Troica, the Troy Commission of scholars
is making this celebrated site safe from tourist destruction
but also making it accessible to the 300,000 annual visitors.
New walking paths have been built through the site, and a
tourist information center with wall posters explaining the
history of Troy was opened to the public this summer.
Information signs throughout the site explain what you are
looking at each step of your way around the acropolis of
Troy. The biggest surprise for a first-time visitor to Troy
is a huge 60-foot-high dark wooden "Trojan Horse" at the
entrance, so big you can climb a ladder into the horse's
belly and imagine that you are Odysseus or one of his chosen
band waiting for the doomed defenders of Troy to drag your
horse into the citadel, where the Trojans were celebrating
false victory.
