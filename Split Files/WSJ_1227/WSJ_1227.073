   Reading &amp; Bates Corp. postponed to Jan. 23 a special
stockholder meeting scheduled for tomorrow, to allow more
time to complete and distribute proxy materials.
   The meeting of the Houston offshore drilling and
engineering concern will vote on a pending recapitalization
plan.

<TEXT>
   The plan would eliminate some $280 million of senior debt
and lease obligations and cancel contingent debt of $50
million in exchange for about 192 million shares of common.
As a group, senior creditors currently hold nearly 60% of
common equity, and the recapitalization would boost that to
nearly 90%.
   The company said that all but one of its senior creditors
involved in an earlier restructuring have signed commitment
letters relating to the latest recapitalization. It said the
remaining senior creditor has agreed to defer until Jan. 31
an interest payment due next Monday.
