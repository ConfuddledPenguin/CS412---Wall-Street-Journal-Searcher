   KUALA LUMPUR -- In the wake of India's caste riots, Sri
Lanka's civil war and Fiji's political mess, one might expect
Asian policy makers to have wised up to the dangers of racial
number-crunching. That is not the case.
   In Malaysia, in particular, the arithmetic of race is
calculated in education, in business and in every part of the
political system. The country's wide-ranging efforts of
social engineering have only widened ethnic divisions and
damped economic growth. They have also undermined any chance
of creating a national identity to which all Malaysians can
claim a connection. Malaysia is a lesson with implications
for any society tempted to believe that racial formulas can
be allocated with justice and imposed without rancor.

   The occasion for this review is the completion of the
20-year term of Malaysia's New Economic Policy. Formulated
after 248 people died in race riots in May 1969, the NEP had
two goals for this nation of Malay, Chinese and Indian
ancestry: to eliminate poverty, and "to reduce and eventually
eliminate the identification of race with economic function."
   The NEP's seemingly neutral language was directed at the
Chinese, who constitute 32% of Malaysians, and who did and do
dominate much of the private-sector economy. The government
decided to try to tip the balance by promoting Malay economic
interests through employment and educational quotas, loans,
subsidies, licensing preferences, and the creation of "trust
agencies" -- government-owned enterprises that acquire equity
in the name of the "Bumiputras." "Bumiputras," Malay for
"sons of the soil," are a classification that includes ethnic
Malays and other indigenous groups. Bumiputras constitute 58%
of the population.
   The NEP was a social engineer's dream. Political elites,
by pulling the right policy levers, would generate an
increasingly competitive Bumiputra entrepreneurial and
professional class. And because the economy would be growing
madly all the while, the Chinese wouldn't mind much. (The 10%
Indian minority was left out of all this.) "The NEP is the
economic foundation for Malaysian society," reiterated the
government in 1985 in an official report. "The achievement of
the NEP targets will provide a firm and lasting foundation
for national unity."
   But 20 years on, even the NEP's defenders agree that
national unity is as distant as ever. No race riots have
rocked the country since 1969, but racial tensions are close
to the surface. "The government says it's one Malaysia, we're
all Malaysians, but that's something of a farce," says an
embittered Chinese high-school teacher in Penang. "It's
really Bumi or non-Bumi. Rightly or wrongly, they are called
sons of the soil. But I was born here and so was my father."
   The teacher, whose son is studying at his own expense at
an Australian university, singles out education preferences
for Bumiputras as a particular sore point. The preferences
work in several different ways. First, major institutions
have quotas to maintain a roughly 55%-45%
Bumiputra/non-Bumiputra composition. Second, the MARA
Institute of Technology, which gives out more than 20,000
degrees a year, allots only 5% of its places for
non-Bumiputras. Third, about 80% of all scholarships go to
Malays. And finally, says a professor at a Kuala Lumpur
university, Malays are graded more leniently in the
classroom.
   In Malaysia there are not enough places to go around; the
country sends only about 6% of its students on to local
higher education, compared with 59% for the U.S., 20% for
Thailand and 38% for the Philippines. That explains why
Malaysia's Chinese and Indian students, according to official
figures, are twice as likely to study abroad as Bumiputras.
   The combination of entrance and scholarship preferences
makes a double bind. Admissions quotas shut out some
qualified non-Bumiputras, who therefore must go abroad to
study but can't always afford to because scholarships for
them are limited. It is hard to know how many children of
Indian pedicab drivers and Chinese day laborers get squeezed
by this Catch-22. But it is certain that the effect is a rise
in resentment and a fall in academic standards. "While the
numbers game may have been won" regarding Bumiputra
enrollment, "the institutionalization of mediocrity is a
by-product of the 1970 NEP restructuring targets," concluded
Kamal Salih of the independent Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research in December 1988.
   Higher education quotas and scholarships have not
benefited poor Malays as much as the Bumiputra elite. These,
of course, are the people who run the government and have
decided that the nation can't live without extending the NEP.
   Advocates of the NEP can point to some progress. Malaysia
has averaged about 6.5% growth a year since 1970 and the
poverty rate has dropped. By official reckoning, the
Bumiputra equity share has risen from 1.5% to about 20%;
other estimates put it higher. Malaysians of every race agree
that since 1969 a visible Bumiputra professional class has
emerged.
   The question is how much credit should go to the NEP. When
the economy slipped into recession in the mid-1980s, the
government loosened NEP restrictions; the obvious implication
is that growth would have been higher without them. And in
terms of changing employment patterns, urbanization and a
changing economy were likely greater factors than an
overblown affirmative action plan.
   Considering all this, the Malaysian authorities could well
declare the NEP a success and have done with it. But because
the NEP has been presented to Bumiputras as living proof of a
benevolent and protective government, not extending the NEP
would be interpreted as a rejection. "Letting the NEP die was
never a prospect," says Noordin Sopiee, director of the
Malaysian Institute for Strategic and International Studies.
   Another major reason for keeping the NEP is that the way
it has been put into practice has bolstered the power of the
ruling coalition, the Barisan Nasional, which is dominated by
the United Malays National Organization and its two junior
partners, the Malaysia Chinese Association and the Malaysian
Indian Congress.
   Because Malays are more or less guaranteed political power
through UMNO, which has ruled since independence in 1957, the
temptation has been to use the political system to advance
ethnic goalsand, eventually, personal ones. Many people, said
then-Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam in the early 1980s,
"had joined {UMNO} to acquire more wealth." This desire fit
hand-in-glove with the NEP's restructuring goals, which
required massive government intervention in the economy.
   In the name of the Bumiputras, government and party now
control much of the mining, plantation and finance
industries, and are an increasing presence in construction
and the media. "The ruling elites, in assuming the role of
trustees, have emerged as a cartel," writes economist Ozay
Mehmet. "They have effectively cornered economic planning and
decision-making to enrich themselves while paying lip-service
to poverty eradication."
   A classic example of how the government uses the NEP to
justify its self-aggrandizement was the awarding in 1987 of
the country's largest public-works contract. The contract to
build a 550-mile road from Singapore to Thailand -- worth
more than $1.8 billion -- went to United Engineers (Malaysia)
Bhd., a company that "had never built any roads and has a
dismal record in many other respects," as the Gerakan Party,
a member of the ruling coalition, pointed out in a letter to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. The company did, however,
have one crucial qualification -- it was controlled by UMNO.
   By awarding the contract to United Engineers (Malaysia),
the government could claim progress on the NEP, because the
company's main shareholder was considered a "Bumiputra"
company. It could also pat itself on the back for
"privatization," since the government per se would not build
the road and collect the tolls.
   How all the finagling that marked this deal helped the
average Bumiputra catch up economically is unclear. More
corporate equity may be in nominally Bumiputra hands, but the
real winners are a few, mostly UMNO-connected businessmen.
How the deal helped UMNO is obvious. One reason the
government gave for granting the project to United Engineers
(Malaysia) is that the profits would help pay for the World
Trade Center, a sleek skyscraper in downtown Kuala Lumpur
that is home to the UMNO party headquarters.
   The fundamental problem with the NEP is that, combined
with the constitutional provisions that make Islam the
official religion and Bahasa Malaysia the official language,
it reinforces the idea that Bumiputras are the only real
Malaysians. Members of the Chinese and Indian minorities, for
example, are commonly referred to as "immigrants," even
though most can trace their Malaysian origins back at least
three generations. Why should there be different degrees of
citizenship just because one's great-great-grandparents were
not born on what is now Malaysian soil?
   There is no sensible answer to this question. But as long
as the powers-that-be swallow most of the NEP's benefits,
they have little incentive to address its abuses. Until that
changes, the NEP subverts its goal of providing "a firm and
lasting foundation for national unity."
