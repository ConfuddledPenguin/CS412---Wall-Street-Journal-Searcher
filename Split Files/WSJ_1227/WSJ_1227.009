   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- H&amp;R Block Inc. said it signed an
agreement to sell Path Management Industries Inc., its
business skills training subsidiary, to the American
Management Association, New York.
   The tax-preparation company said the sale price of its
subsidiary was $20 million in cash and notes. "We concluded
that Path Management Industries no longer fits in the
strategic plans of H&amp;R Block," said Henry W. Bloch, chairman
and chief executive officer of H&amp;R Block.
