   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. bondholders are
holding up approval of a debt-for-equity swap, saying they
want assurances from federal regulators that the ailing bank
won't be seized prematurely.
   The assurances are the main condition bondholders are
seeking before approving the proposed swap, which would give
Bank of New England breathing room by raising desperately
needed capital. Many analysts say that the bank won't be able
to survive for long if the swap isn't completed.

   Bondholder representatives, who tentatively agreed last
week to swap $706 million in debentures for 92% ownership of
the bank's common stock, said they are planning to meet with
officials at the office of the comptroller of the currency
early next week. They plan to discuss whether the bank's
preliminary year-end earnings report, which has been given to
regulators but not disclosed publicly, indicates an imminent
seizure. Bondholder wariness was first reported yesterday in
American Banker.
   "No one is going to swap into mostly equity if the
institution is about to be seized," said Gregory Kiernan,
chairman of the subordinated bondholders committee. "We'd
look like fools. It'd be tantamount to bondholder suicide."
While bondholders have some contractual rights to a bank's
assets if it is seized, stockholders get wiped out.
   The bondholders' minimum demand, according to a committee
member, is that the bank not be seized unless it becomes
insolvent -- generally defined as the moment when a bank's
capital has disappeared.
   "That's not a problem -- we almost never seize banks
before they actually become insolvent," said Ellen Stockdale,
a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office. "But if the
bondholders want a guarantee that we're not going to close
the bank in the near future, they're not going to get it. We
just don't offer those kinds of assurances. If regulators
feel the bank is under water and getting in deeper, they'll
want to close it and not be constrained by some agreement."
   The swap requires board and stockholder approval, and both
groups are expected to clear it. The board, which met
yesterday to discuss the matter, will "continue its analysis
and deliberations in early January," a spokesman said.
   "I think they'll iron out the details and the swap will
happen before the bank goes insolvent," says Gerard Cassidy,
a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony and R.L. Day in Portland,
Maine. "Of course, even a successful swap will only buy them
time for a few quarters. And unless they get a grip on
nonperforming assets and stop the losses, it will only mean a
lease on life until the summer or early fall."
   If the board approves the swap, the bank must receive
regulatory clearance and then mail an offering to
bondholders. Bondholders will have 21 days to respond. Only
if 90% of the bonds are tendered will the deal proceed to its
final stage: shareholder approval of a vast, new issue of
stock to be swapped for the debt.
   The problem is that all this takes time -- a commodity in
short supply these days at Bank of New England. The bank had
a loss of $123 million in the third quarter, shrinking its
capital to a thin $255 million, only 1.1% of total assets of
$23 billion.
   With the weakened real estate market worsened by a
sluggish New England economy, Bank of New England was
struggling under $2.84 million of nonperforming assets,
mostly soured commercial real estate loans, as of Sept. 30.
Carrying costs for that amount of bad assets is about $250
million a year for the bank, which had a $203 million loss in
the first nine months of this year.
   After the Bank of Boston Corp., which had a loss of $255
million in the third quarter, announced last week that it
would report "substantial losses" for the fourth quarter,
analysts began predicting fourth-quarter losses of between
$100 million and $200 million for Bank of New England. Such
losses would push the bank precariously close to insolvency.
   The proposed swap, if successful, would boost Bank of New
England back to safer ground. By getting rid of $706 million
in debt, the bank will save about $60 million a year in
interest payments, and will push its total capital to nearly
3% of total assets, a level regulators ordered the bank to
reach by last spring.
   To be swapped for the $706 million in existing debt would
be $606 million in special preferred stock which soon would
become common stock, and $100 million in new debt that would
require no interest payments and could be redeemed in five
years for cash or equity.
   Of the numerous terms hashed out between the bank and
bondholder representatives in almost six months of
negotiations, only two relatively small provisions remain for
the board's approval, according to officials involved in the
negotiations. One involves the issuing of the $100 million in
new debt. The bank had originally agreed to only $40 million
of such specialized debt, which gives bondholders some
contractual claims on the bank's assets if it is seized or
purchased. The other provision involves releases for the
bank's board members from legal liability if the bank fails.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of New England shares slipped 6.25 cents to 68.75 cents.
