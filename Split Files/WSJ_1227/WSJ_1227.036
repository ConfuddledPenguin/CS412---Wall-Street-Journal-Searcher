   NEW YORK -- Good cheer spread through the stock market
yesterday, fulfilling expectations for a traditional year-end
rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added a solid 15.84
points to close at 2637.13.

   But traders were wary of reading too much into the
market's strength, noting that activity was relatively
lighter than even during Monday's truncated session.
   About 54 million shares had changed hands by 2 p.m. EST
yesterday, less than the 57 million shares that had traded by
the same time Monday when the market closed two hours early.
Nearly 79 million shares traded all of yesterday.
   With three trading sessions remaining in 1990, the
industrials remain more than 116 points below where they
started the year.
   Stocks and bonds both got a lift from an Israeli news
report that a meeting between Secretary of State James Baker
and Iraq's Saddam Hussein had been set for Jan. 9 in Baghdad.
   The State Department denied that a date had been set,
however, and said no behind-the-scenes negotiations with the
Iraqis were taking place. And while persistent reports of
back-channel talks between Washington and Baghdad have raised
some hopes that war can be avoided, rising oil prices told of
continuing concern in some quarters. Crude oil for February
delivery rose $1.30 to $27.22 a barrel.
   Nonetheless, the stock market held its early gains and
rose through the session, largely on seasonal factors.
   Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns, says much
of the buying came from year-end window dressing by portfolio
managers who have lots of cash remaining on their books.
   Other market watchers said some traders are buying shares
now to catch the wave of new money that many expect to flow
into the market from pension funds after the first of the
year. That new money typically drives share prices higher
during the first week of January.
   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.95 to 330.85;
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.59 to
180.60; and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.84 to
306.55.
   Big Board advancers led decliners, 774 to 639, with 545
stocks unchanged.
   The major oil companies gained along with oil prices.
Chevron gained 2 to 73 1/4, Texaco jumped 1 3/4 to 60 1/2,
Mobil added 1 1/8 to 58 1/4, and Atlantic Richfield added 1
7/8 to 124 3/8. Pennzoil, up 1 3/8 to 65, said it raised its
stake in Chevron to 9.4%.
   William M. LeFevre, market strategist at Advest Inc.,
notes that the market is close to having retraced half the
drop from its July highs to its October lows.
   He says stocks may pull back once they have reached that
level, but he doubts that the Dow Jones Industrial Average
will fall further than the low 2500s.
   Many money managers missed the rally from the October lows
and now are waiting for share prices to drop so they can get
back into the market, he adds. But that eager money will
cushion any market declines and keep sell-offs shallow.
   "I think we've seen the bear market's low," says Mr.
LeFevre.
   Tiffany tumbled 4 3/8 to 37 1/4. The retailer said that
while its world-wide holiday sales rose 8% from last year,
U.S. holiday sales were below expectations. The company said
the weak domestic sales justified a downward revision in
earnings estimates for the fourth quarter ending Jan. 31.
   According to Zack's Investment Research, five analysts
surveyed expected Tiffany to earn between $1.02 a share and
$1.22 a share in the quarter. Tiffany said it still could
reach $1.02 a share, which is what it earned in the year-ago
quarter.
   Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber added 3/8 to 17 7/8, and Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber rose 3/4 to 18 1/8. Despite yesterday's uptick
in oil prices, both companies will benefit from the recent
decline in the price of crude oil from its high above $40 a
barrel.
   UAL rose 2 to 115 but said it didn't know why the stock
was moving. UAL's gain is all the more surprising given
yesterday's surge in oil prices. Rising oil prices generally
depress airline stocks as investors anticipate higher fuel
costs.
   Pan Am picked up 1/8 to 1 3/8, just as merger talks with
Trans World Airlines hit snags. TWA's owner, Carl Icahn, said
Tuesday that Pan Am officials pulled out of a scheduled
Monday meeting concerning his proposal to acquire Pan Am.
   Mr. Icahn also questioned the seriousness of Pan Am's
interest in merging, after learning through news reports that
Pan Am is considering a $150 million offer for its lucrative
shuttle from PacifiCorp, which was down 1/8 to 22 1/8. NWA
Inc. would operate the shuttle. A Pan Am spokesman retorted
that Mr. Icahn had yet to offer a definitive proposal.
   AMR dropped 3/8 to 48 7/8. The airline holding company
said pilots at its American Airlines unit are staging a
sickout over stalled contract talks and have contributed to
flight cancellations. The pilots' union denied it organized a
protest.
   Nacco Industries fell 3/8 to 29. The company expects to
take a one-time charge of $10.3 million, or $1.16 a share, in
the fourth quarter, due primarily to restructuring and plant
closings from recently acquired businesses.
   Blockbuster Entertainment eased 3/8 to 25 7/8. The
video-store chain is preparing a massive data base of the
movies its 30 million customers rent and plans to sell
information from the data base next year to direct mailers.
   Some financial stocks rallied. First City Bancorp. jumped
1/2 to 3 1/2, CalFed added 5/8 to 4 3/8, and Baltimore
Bancorp rose 1/4 to 4 1/4.
   Global Natural Resources edged up 1/4 to 6. Noel Group
raised its stake in the company to just above 25%.
   Lamson &amp; Sessions rose 1/4 to 4 3/8. Investor Mario
Gabelli increased his stake in the company to just past 5%.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.40
to 304.99.
   Go-Video dropped 5/8 to 3 1/4 after filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for a 1.5 million-share
offering.
   American Stock Exchange volume totaled 7,969,745 shares
compared with 4,668,910 Monday. Decliners outnumbered
advancers 278 to 233, with 315 unchanged.
