   NEW YORK -- Tiffany &amp; Co. said earnings estimates for its
fiscal fourth quarter are too high based on holiday sales
results, which rose but were below expectations.
   William R. Chaney, chairman of the jewelry retailer, said
U.S. sales were sufficiently below targeted increases to
justify a downward revision in estimates for the quarter
ending Jan. 31, 1991. Analysts' estimates had ranged from
per-share net income of $1.10 to $1.28. Mr. Chaney indicated
that profit could still reach approximately the level of the
year-earlier quarter, when Tiffany earned $15.9 million, or
$1.02 a share.

   After yesterday's announcement, Tiffany fell $4.375 to
close at $37.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Tiffany said world-wide net sales rose 8% for the
eight-week period from Nov. 1 through Dec. 25, compared with
the year-earlier period. Mr. Chaney said sales in the U.S.
increased modestly but were below expectations, reflecting
consumer concern about the economy. However, international
retail sales growth continued to be strong. The company said
international retail sales rose 28%; U.S. retail sales rose
2%; and direct marketing sales rose 1%, based on preliminary
unaudited figures.
   Although some U.S. jewelry companies had been urging
customers to buy before the end of the year to avoid the
scheduled federal tax increase on luxury goods, a spokesman
said, "We didn't sense any impact on our holiday sales."
   Mr. Chaney said the company "will enjoy a record level of
sales and earnings in 1990. Although we are disappointed with
the results of the holiday period in the U.S., we recognize
that widespread economic concerns have affected consumer
spending at every level. We are encouraged, however, that the
number of customer purchases in Tiffany's U.S. stores
increased over the 1989 level, although the average customer
purchase declined somewhat. It demonstrated continued strong
customer loyalty."
   He said the company's strong financial position will
enable the company to aggressively pursue its expansion plans
in 1991. "While the current U.S. consumer spending slowdown
is, no doubt, affecting us, we believe our longer-term
opportunities are as bright as ever."
   The company expects to report results in early March.
