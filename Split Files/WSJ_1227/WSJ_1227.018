   NEW YEAR'S EVE galas still beckon despite economy; but are
they last hurrahs?
   The Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles is booked for a New
Year's Eve dinner costing $180 a person, up from $175 a year
ago. "As good as last year," it says of the reservations.
Chicago's Crowne Plaza Hotel does better than last year, when
some accommodations went begging. This year it sold out a
package costing $179.91 a couple that includes an overnight
room, dinner and open bar. Tatou, a New York supper club that
sells out a party costing $192 a person on the main floor and
$125 upstairs, thinks it could have done just as well at $50
more.

   But some hosts sense economic jitters. Roxbury, a Los
Angeles club that has sold out a dinner costing $75 each,
rejected a more elaborate offering, worrying a recession
"could have some impact on the way people are willing to
spend money." Pratos in Carlstadt, N.J., complains "economic
uncertainties are holding down business."
   Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel sees this as "a last chance
to celebrate, what with the uncertainty of 1991."
                                                                                                       

   MARKETING NIRVANA: Getting someone to pay to promote your
wares for you.
   With its first product, Gemstar Development Corp.,
Pasadena, Calif., seems to have found the path to every
drummer's fantasy. It is getting several dozen newspapers and
TV Guide to help create a market for Gemstar's VCR Plus+, a
hand-held remote device selling for $59.95 that lets viewers
easily set their home VCRs to tape any TV show. The
publications, including the Los Angeles Times and New York
Times, are running code numbers for each program that enable
VCR Plus+ to do its thing.
   Willard Colston, director of development at the Los
Angeles Times, says the paper pays Tribune Media Services "a
reasonable amount" to add the numbers to the TV listings that
the paper buys. And, for the exclusive use of the numbers in
its circulation area, the Times promises Gemstar to promote
VCR Plus+ for two years and then start paying a cash fee. For
its investment, says Mr. Colston, the Times gets a service it
hopes will keep readers happy and draw new subscribers.
"We're very pleased," Mr. Colston declares. And so, too, is
Gemstar. Louise Wannier, a vice president, says sales have
been running at an annual rate of more than three million
units, triple the company's original first-year goal.
                                                                                                       

   ROUGH WATERS: Recreational boating industry battens down
for squall.
   Unit sales of pleasure boats, which sank 15% in 1989, are
"off in excess of that in 1990," the National Marine
Manufacturers Association says. "People don't buy
discretionary durables when they don't feel good," a
spokesman explains, contending that consumers haven't had
much to feel good about lately, with the weak economy, tight
credit, the Persian Gulf crisis and, starting next Tuesday, a
10% luxury tax on the cost of new boats over $100,000.
Norwalk Yacht Sales in Connecticut confirms the tough sales
environment: "We do a lot more chasing" to find buyers, it
says.
   Brunswick Corp., which has been cutting production for two
years to bring inventories in line with sagging demand, saw
marine sales continue to drop in the third quarter, off 6%
from the 1989 pace. Still, says CEO Jack Reichert, "we're
doing OK; we made money." Also cutting production has been
Outboard Marine Corp., whose sales slumped 21% in the year
ended Sept. 30. But that's stronger than the industry's
performance, asserts CEO James Chapman. "We picked up market
share," he says.
   Exports are bright spots for many builders. They sell more
boats abroad than foreign makers sell here.
                                                                                                       

   UNMODEL BEHAVIOR: The Federal Trade Commission cracks down
on model agencies that allegedly entice substantial fees from
prospects but do little in return.
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER SCAM: Citicorp Mortgage warns customers that some
"unauthorized companies" are telling borrowers to send
monthly checks to a new mortgage servicing firm that then
pockets the money.
                                                                                                       

   ONE-SHOT cost-cutting can cause more harm than good,
consultant Sibson &amp; Co. says, with a survey that shows most
companies instead properly direct their efforts to improving
customer service and management quality.
                                                                                                       

   IN SELLING, nice guys can finish last, product knowledge
isn't all that vital.
   What counts is trust, asserts Jack Snader, president of
Systema Corp., a Northbrook, Ill., consultant. "Don't
automatically teach `people-chemistry' skills. Don't spend
countless hours having your salespeople learn every technical
gizmo. Rather, ask customers how they want to be treated, and
do it that way," he says.
   Salespeople rated tops in technical proficiency by their
managers can be seen as technical incompetents by their
clients. Similarly, great personalities often are bested by
people with fewer social skills. But "over 200,000 customers
say they must be able to trust the salesperson to do what he
says he will do," he advises.
   There can be little trust, he says, if customers believe
sales reps are just trying to meet a quota.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Fair warning] Gaston &amp; Snow, a Boston law firm,
marks envelopes carrying a newsletter: "The enclosed
materials are considered `advertising' under Supreme Judicial
Court Rule 3:07." . . . Sin-tax error: A federal judge
sentences a Cincinnati man to five years in prison for
selling counterfeit computer chips and sending money abroad
in violation of IRS rules.
