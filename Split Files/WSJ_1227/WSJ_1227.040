   NEW YORK -- Stocks gained and bonds rallied on reports
that Iraq and the U.S. are preparing for talks on the Mideast
crisis. The dollar closed mixed in quiet trading.
   An Israeli newspaper reported that U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III will likely meet Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein in Baghdad on Jan. 9. The State Department denied a
date has been set, however.

   Still, bonds and stocks rose on the news, ignoring a sharp
gain in crude oil prices. Long-term Treasury bonds gained
nearly a point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.84 to 2637.13.
   But many investors say they are wary of any stock-market
gains until the Mideast conflict is resolved and the
minefield of fourth-quarter earnings reports is traversed.
   The rout in Tiffany &amp; Co.'s stock yesterday showed that
the bad news bears were wide awake on a slow day. Tiffany
said sales during the holiday shopping period rose, but not
as much as expected. Tiffany stock fell 4 3/8 to 37 1/4, a
decline of 10.5%.
   "Most people are anticipating a number of poor"
fourth-quarter earnings reports in January, said A. Marshall
Acuff, strategist at Smith Barney. "A lot of people are
clinging to the sidelines and taking a wait-and-see
attitude."
   Government bond traders said the Mideast conflict is the
most significant question currently facing bond investors.
"The Fed has made its move" to lower interest rates, "so
basically we are hanging around waiting for Iraq," one trader
said. Short-term rates are expected to drop further as signs
of weak consumer spending proliferate.
   Japanese banks were bidding aggressively for
dollar-denominated short-term investments, helping to support
the U.S. currency against the yen. But with U.S. interest
rates trending down, traders have no confidence that a
sustained rally is in store for the dollar.
   The dollar slid against the German mark and other European
currencies on profit-taking following its big advance late
last week after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's
resignation raised fears about stability in the U.S.S.R.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks rose. Advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners
774 to 639 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled
78,730,000 shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bonds advanced. The yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond fell to 8.28% from 8.36% on Dec. 24.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar finished mixed. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.5368 marks, and 136.25 yen, compared
with 1.5440 marks and 136 yen late Monday.
