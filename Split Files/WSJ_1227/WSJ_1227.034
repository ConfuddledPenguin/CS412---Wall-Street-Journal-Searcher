   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
approved the transfer of control of WKYC-TV in Cleveland to
Multimedia Inc. from National Broadcasting Co.
   The transaction, proposed last spring, had been challenged
by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
and the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians. The agency dismissed the two unions' claims. The
unions argued that the transaction would be anticompetitive
and against the public interest, and that NBC would continue
to influence and control the station.

   Multimedia agreed to pay $65 million and assume a $36.7
million note in exchange for 100% of the voting stock,
representing 51% of the equity, of a new corporation, WKYC-TV
Holdings Inc. The new company will control the license of
WKYC, Channel 3. NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., will
receive nonvoting, convertible stock representing 49% of the
equity. NBC has the option of converting its shares into
voting stock a year after the transaction.
