   HOUSTON -- Two Pesos Inc. said its president and chief
executive officer, Ghulam M. Bombaywala, exercised his option
to purchase 250,000 shares of the company's common stock from
an affiliate of Marno M. McDermott Jr., chairman, for
$375,000.
   The option was the first installment of an agreement that
permits Mr. Bombaywala to exercise options on up to one
million shares of Two Pesos common held by Mr. McDermott in
250,000-share increments every six months. Mr. Bombaywala now
owns 2,250,000 shares, or 27.8%, of Two Pesos common, all
purchased from Mr. McDermott. He also controls another
1,732,679 shares of the Mexican-style restaurant chain's
stock through a voting agreement with Mr. McDermott.
