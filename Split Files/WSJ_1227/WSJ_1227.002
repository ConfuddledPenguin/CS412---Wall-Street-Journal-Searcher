   The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction it isn't. But it does rival
the Nobel Prize for Literature.
   At least the monetary reward does -- $500,000. It's The
Turner (as in Ted) Tomorrow Award, to be given next June to a
work of fiction that's set in the near future (1991-2021) and
incorporates themes "ensuring the survival and prosperity of
all life on our planet."

   But you better hurry up: The deadline is midnight Monday.
   Mr. Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. are
sponsoring the competition, which was announced in November
1989. But Selmer Bringsjord, an assistant professor of
philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and colleague
David Porush just got started writing their entry last month.
"We write very fast," says Mr. Bringsjord.
   Their novel, "The Second Coming," is about a band of
forgotten SETI (Search For Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)
pioneers sent out by the world to search for
extra-terrestrial life. They've returned to a dying Earth
with desperate solutions to the world's problems, says Prof.
Bringsjord.
   And why are these authors entering the contest? "The money
is staggering," he acknowledges. (The novel is taking some
time away from Mr. Bringsjord's real-life project: developing
a computer software program to write fiction for adults.)
   Mary Jane Batson, manager for Turner Publishing Inc., says
more than 1,000 manuscripts -- of 50,000 to 100,000 words
each -- have been submitted, and the New York processing
office is "inundated with bags and bags of mail." Turner has
mailed about 25,000 entry kits world-wide. "I do think we'll
go beyond 2,000," she says. But that would still be far below
the 10,000 to 15,000 entries originally projected.
   Besides the grand-prize winner, four $50,000 "merit"
prizes will be announced next June 3. Turner Publishing will
publish the books and promises to spend $50,000 apiece
promoting them. The authors get royalties, but Turner gets
film rights. Ms. Batson insists the competition wasn't
established as a moneymaking venture.
   The judges who will read the 30 to 40 finalists include
well-known authors Wallace Stegner, Ray Bradbury, William
Styron and Carlos Fuentes.
   And how does Prof. Bringsjord's band of adventurers
propose to solve the world's travails? Their message, he
says, is: "You're on your own, you're your own salvation,
cultivate your garden."
