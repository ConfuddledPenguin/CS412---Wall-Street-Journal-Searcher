   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Perini Investment Properties Inc.
said it hired Lazard Freres &amp; Co. as its financial adviser to
help the company explore a possible restructuring, merger or
sale. A Perini spokesman declined to elaborate.
   Earlier this year the real estate investment trust
suspended its dividend, noting a cash flow decline.
