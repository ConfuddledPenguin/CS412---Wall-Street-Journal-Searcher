   Radio Liberty's Soviet/East European Report recently noted
a curious exchange between a leading Soviet philosopher,
Andranik Migranyan, and the eminent British philosopher Karl
Popper. About two years ago, some 100 Soviet philosophers
boycotted a speech to the World Congress of Philosophy by Mr.
Popper, author of "The Open Society and its Enemies." A year
before that speech, Mr. Migranyan made one of the earliest
calls for creating a genuine civil society in the Soviet
Union. Now, he told Mr. Popper in an interview, the country
needs an "iron hand" because "it's impossible to pass over
from totalitarianism to democracy at a moment's notice."
   No doubt some would sympathize with the notion that the
Soviet government has to regain control of its disorderly
society. However, it's difficult to understand Mr.
Migranyan's logic. The Soviet Union is disorderly because the
bureaucracy's thousands of iron hands won't let go of what
they once held. Giving them more "control" will likely choke
the newborn life out of Soviet civil society.
