   Among forest products companies, the 1980-1982 housing
slump is widely viewed as having produced the industry's
biggest losses since World War II.
   Soon, that slump may look like a romp in the woods.

   Consider:
   More sawmills have been closed in timber-rich Washington,
Idaho and Oregon so far this year than during any 12-month
period in the history of the industry, according to
consultant Paul F. Ehinger. Nearly 100 mills, or about one
for every four in the region, have been idled at some point
during the year. Many will never open again. That compares
with 54 mills lost during all of 1980-1982.
   Slack business has cut deeply into the industry's work
force. Some 8,450 workers have been laid off at some point
this year because of the mill closures, and permanent job
losses already are at 40% of losses seen in the previous
bust.
   Industry profits are sinking fast, with the top five
producers reporting an aggregate 46% decline in earnings for
the third quarter, and forecasting more bad news for the
fourth quarter. Further, analysts expect the cracks that are
showing up in the industry's foundations will widen next
year, and possibly beyond.
   "Collectively, there's more damage being done (to the
industry) than has ever been done before," said Mr. Ehinger,
a former president of the American Plywood Association.
"There's something about this slowdown that seems to drain
the vitality out of the whole system. It's hard to put into
words, but there is a difference."
   One difference is that companies are being hit from both
sides: high raw material prices, reflecting environmental
restrictions on logging, and plummeting prices from low
demand for building products, reflecting rapidly weakening
residential construction activity.
   Despite raw material shortages, prices of plywood and
other structural wood products have fallen 20% to 33% since
January. In real terms, prices still are above the level they
were in the 1980-1982 period, but perhaps not for long.
   Multifamily housing construction is at a post-war low, and
single-family home starts, while still above levels of the
early 1980s, are falling fast. Shopping mall, hotel and
office-building construction, depressed for three years,
shows no signs of a revival. Compounding the mess is a
growing credit crunch affecting developers, reflecting the
thrift debacle and evolving concerns about the health of the
nation's banking system.
   By contrast, in the last downturn from 1980-82, there were
exceptions in the economic drought. Some companies had large
work orders under contract, others survived by cutting prices
and making deals on short-term sales. Such flexibility no
longer exists, prompting widespread closings and other moves.
   Early this month, Bohemia Inc., a midsized wood products
concern based in Eugene, Ore., said its board approved a
restructuring that includes selling its California
operations, which accounted for about 24% of sales in the
latest fiscal year. The company, started in 1916, also said
it was considering closing some or all of its Oregon
operations.
   Pope &amp; Talbot Inc. recently reduced its work force at its
Port Gamble, Ore., mill by 44%, and reduced lumber production
there to 350,000 from 800,000 board feet per day. The mill
processed lumber primarily for the suddenly weak California
housing market, said Reed R. Trull, sales manager at the
mill. "We're going through a liquidity crunch that could put
us in worse shape than we saw in 1981-1982," said Mr. Trull.
   Pope &amp; Talbot Inc. said weak lumber markets caused by the
construction recession would result in "near break-even"
fourth-quarter earnings for the Portland, Ore., wood products
company. The company earned 84 cents a share for 1989's
fourth quarter and posted earnings of 30 cents a share for
the third quarter.
   The biggest players also are being affected.
Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said it expected flat fourth-quarter
earnings as it closed all of its 22 operations in California
for the Thanksgiving week, an unprecedented closure. The
projection surprised analysts who had been anticipating
earnings increases. Weyerhaeuser Corp. recently reduced its
work force by 290 employees, or about 50%, at a big mill in
Springfield, Ore.
   For owners of small logging concerns and their workers,
time and patience are at an even lower ebb.
   "Rose Logging has work until about the second week in
January and that's it," says Duane Grange, office manager for
Rose Logging Inc., based in Springfield. He says the company
currently has 21 people working two logging sites; that
compares with 104 people on 14 or 15 sites in midsummer.
"You're either out of business or you're shut down hoping the
spring will bring work."
   And the spring doesn't look good.
   "Springtime is the traditional start of the season and an
increased demand," said Sherman Chao, an analyst at Salomon
Inc. But "it didn't happen this year and I don't expect it
will happen next year," he said. He is predicting a 20%
decline in industry profits for 1991.
   "Making a forecast for the housing sector assumes that the
money for building will be there," Mr. Chao said, "but until
the financial sector is on solid ground, it is difficult to
even discuss the return of the housing industry."
   Certainly, many furloughed workers aren't waiting for a
turnaround. Loggers and millworkers are entering federal job
retraining programs at colleges and universities around the
region. At the Oregon Office of Economic Development, state
officials are looking to create such jobs as cabinet and
furniture makers in the secondary markets as primary wood
jobs are lost.
   Jon E. Fair spent 21 years working in mills in Washington
and at the Pope &amp; Talbot sawmill in his hometown, Oak Ridge,
Ore. "From the time I got out of high school I worked at the
mill," said the 40-year-old Mr. Fair. "Everything I did was
to further myself in the woods industry, but not anymore." He
was laid off in July 1989.
   Today, he studies aviation mechanics at Lane Community
College in Eugene, and runs into former co-workers in the
campus cafeteria. He says there are people in Oak Ridge who
believe the traditional logging economy will return, but he
thinks those days are gone. "I'll have to leave Oak Ridge and
head for San Diego, New Mexico or maybe even Texas or
Florida," said Mr. Fair.
