   JPS TEXTILE GROUP Inc. (Greenville, S.C.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded the credit ratings
of JPS, citing the company's plan to restructure under a
"pre-packaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing. About $460
million of the company's long-term debt is affected, the
rating firm said. The ratings downgraded to Ca from Caa are
variabe-rate notes, senior subordinated notes, subordinated
debentures and senior subordinated discount notes. The rating
of the company's preferred stock remains at Ca, Moody's said.
JPS Textile, the successor company to much of J.P. Stevens &amp;
Co., declined to comment on Moody's downgrade. In a
pre-packaged Chapter 11 reorganization, a company wins
creditors' approval before making its filing in bankruptcy
court. Such filings, in theory, can be resolved much more
quickly than ordinary bankruptcy law cases. In Chapter 11, a
company gets court protection against creditor lawsuits while
it attempts to come up with a plan to pay its debt. Odyssey
Partners, a New York investment banking firm, led a buy-out
of the textile company in late 1988.

   NIPPON TELEGRAPH &amp; TELEPHONE Corp. -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. assigned a triple-A rating to Nippon's offering
of 6.8% bonds due 2001. The issue totals 50 billion yen ($370
million). Moody's said it based its rating on NTT's "dominant
market position and solid financial profile." But it noted
that NTT revenue and profit growth are slowing because of
increased competition in its markets and price erosion. While
Moody's expects NTT's competitors "to make gradual but
limited increases in their shares of the market," the agency
said NTT has increased capital spending, which "should enable
the company to maintain service levels and also permit the
introduction of new services." As a result, "NTT will
maintain a strong balance sheet, generate improved earnings
and increase its coverage of fixed charges," Moody's said.

   TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER Co. (Tucson, Ariz.) -- Moody's
Investor's Service Inc. downgraded the securities rating of
this utility's first mortgage and secured pollution control
issues to Single-B-3 from Single-B-2. About $500 million of
securities is affected. Moody's attributed the downgrade to
two adverse Arizona state court decisions that could force
the company to take up to $350 million in pretax write-downs,
"adding to the continued deterioration of an already weakened
financial condition," the agency said. Moody's said it did
not change the company's ratings on unsecured pollution
control issues at Caa and preferred stock at Caa. A spokesman
for the company declined to comment.
