   NEW YORK -- Memberships of four major New York commodities
exchanges approved, as expected, a relocation of their
trading floors to a new site just north of the World Trade
Center in lower Manhattan.
   Voting by the members -- which followed approval by the
four exchanges' boards on Nov. 29 -- was completed late last
week. Final tallies were made yesterday, a spokeswoman for
the exchanges said.

   The four exchanges are the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange
and the New York Cotton Exchange. The New York Futures
Exchange, a unit of the New York Stock Exchange, which rents
space from the Cotton Exchange, is also expected to move to
the new location.
   The relocation issue has been closely watched because of a
battle that ensued between New York and New Jersey over which
state would get the exchanges, which currently operate side
by side on one floor of the World Trade Center but need more
space. The new trading facility is scheduled to be available
for occupancy by the exchanges in 1994.
