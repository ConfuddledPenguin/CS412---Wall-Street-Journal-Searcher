   LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp. said it discovered natural gas
in a wildcat well on its Hanson Prospect in Kalkaska County,
Mich.
   In a test, the well produced at a rate of about nine
million cubic feet of gas a day through an 18/64-inch choke,
with a flowing tubing pressure of 4,145 pounds a square inch,
at depths of between 10,890 and 10,950 feet. Unocal
calculated the absolute open flow rate at 91 million cubic
feet a day.

   Unocal operates and holds a 39.3% working interest in the
well. Shell Western Exploration &amp; Production Inc., a U.S.
unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, holds the remaining 60.7%.
   Separately, Unocal said it successfully tested gas in two
geological areas on Block 12/27 in the Gulf of Thailand. The
Moragot No. 1 well was drilled to a depth of 11,120 feet, and
gas flowed to the surface. The Pailin No. 2 well was drilled
to 11,572 feet and tested a combined rate of 14.8 million
cubic feet of gas and 189 barrels of condensate a day through
a half-inch choke. Unocal's Unocal Thailand unit holds a 35%
interest in the block. It expects to drill four more
exploration wells in 1991.
