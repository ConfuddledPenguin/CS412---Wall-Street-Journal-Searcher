   SHANGHAI, China -- It is 2 p.m., and Yang Huaiding,
China's biggest stock player, is scheming. Known as
"Millions" Yang, he huddles with aides in the nerve center of
his financial empire -- a seedy coffee shop in a converted
movie-house balcony in Shanghai's former French quarter.
   It may not be the Trump Tower, but for mainland China the
trappings are impressive. A female assistant leans over his
shoulder and deferentially plops energy-giving ginseng root
into his tea. Other assistants report in by beeper calls as
their boss directs them in stock trades. Mr. Yang keeps extra
packs of Marlboros just to distribute to gangsters who come
nosing around to check him out.

   "He's a real operator," says a Chinese economist, speaking
of Mr. Yang. "If he lived in Taiwan or Hong Kong, he would be
very, very rich." Shan Weijian, a professor of management at
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, exclaims,
"He is incredible. He makes money from the government's
shortcomings while advocating change through financial
markets."
   Yet like Wall Street investors, Mr. Yang is encountering
harder times.
   Since the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in
June 1989, this country's basic economic line has undergone
major revision -- from "To Get Rich Is Glorious," to
"Wholeheartedly Rely on the Working Class." Mr. Yang, a
working-class man who got rich, is now caught in the middle
between changing propaganda campaigns.
   In the 1990s, it seems, arbitragers are no more welcome in
China than they are on Wall Street. But the 40-year-old Mr.
Yang, an ardent believer in freer markets, is not giving up.
He declares, "We are planning a stock market revolution]" And
in fact, if he can last long enough, time may be on his side.
   Orthodox Marxists may try to twist China back to central
planning, but the long-term outlook doesn't look promising.
Some 60% of state industries already are in the red, the
government is going broke, and China's grizzled leaders are
too unpopular to bail the government out through their usual
practice of force-feeding state bonds to workers.
   As a result, some government bankers and economists say,
the government sooner or later may have to be rescued by
people like Mr. Yang -- no matter how ideologically out of
step they may be. "These kinds of players are absolutely
essential to give the markets liquidity, I keep telling the
government," says a Beijing economist with government
connections.
   But until capitalism makes a comeback, the story of how
Mr. Yang got the nickname "Baiwan," which means millions, and
cornered the Shanghai stock market, is a tale of how China's
reformist past is haunting its regressive present.
   In just over two years, Mr. Yang used his ninth-grade
education and trading tips from financial books to transform
himself from a $400-a-year steelworker into a savvy
securities trader who averages $100,000 a year in investment
gains.
   Not that being rich in China is much fun these days. At a
time when ostentation invites political peril, Mr. Yang, with
a thick mop of uncombed hair, several days' stubble on his
chin, and painfully bad teeth, prudently looks as if he had
never left the factory floor. Officially, he is unemployed.
He lives in a tiny apartment with his wife and five-year-old
son, wears worn-out polyester clothes and buys next to
nothing. He says he pours all of his profits back into the
market. For now anyway, authorities familiar with his
reputation choose to leave him alone.
   Essentially, Mr. Yang got rich the easy way: by
capitalizing on confusion as his country lurched toward
capitalism without any securities laws.
   The stage was set for Mr. Yang's success by Zhao Ziyang,
the reform-minded former premier and Chinese Communist Party
secretary-general who was deposed by conservatives after
troops mowed down pro-democracy demonstrators on June 4 last
year.
   In 1981, Mr. Zhao began issuing government treasury bills
to put the savings of China's masses to use in rebuilding the
country's tattered economy. He also encouraged local
governments and state-owned enterprises to start selling
stocks and bonds. Before long, the haphazardly regulated
experiment proved chaotic. By the time the government pulled
the plug on it in the spring of 1988, 61 cities had been
approved to start markets for bonds. And more than a
half-dozen cities had set up their own rudimentary stock
markets.
   Mr. Yang kept a close eye on this process. Born the year
after Mao Tse-tung's Communist guerrillas toppled Chiang
Kaishek's Kuomintang, he knew nothing but communism. But he
squirreled away his salary and looked for opportunities.
   He became a financial planner in the steel factory. He
studied translations of Western financial books. And so when
China backtracked on economic reforms in 1988, Mr. Yang found
opportunity staring him in the face.
   Out in the rural provinces, workers no longer wanted their
experimental bonds, many of which they had been forced by the
government to buy through payroll deductions. But in Mr.
Yang's native city of Shanghai, which had been the most
robust stock market in Asia before the revolution, more
sophisticated investors understood the interest-paying
coupons' value.
   In May 1988, Mr. Yang gathered his $8,000 savings. Every
other day, he hopped trains to the countryside. After buying
the bonds cheap from local banks, which were prohibited by
law from selling them across provincial borders, Mr. Yang
then brought them back to Shanghai, where investors eagerly
snapped them up.
   Each trip brought Mr. Yang a $5,000 profit -- quite a sum
in China, where per capita income averages about $350 a year.
But a couple of months later, the government lifted the ban
on banks' trading bonds with one another across provincial
borders, and Mr. Yang lost his edge.
   He then switched to stocks -- a market even more confused
than the bond market. In late 1989, the government gave a
green light to resurrect dormant stock exchanges in Shanghai
and Shenzhen, a special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong.
   Shenzhen exploded in a frenzy of trading. The speculation
grew so unruly by July that the Chinese government
reconsidered its open-mindedness. It slapped restrictions on
the amount the market could rise or fall each day, and
imposed fines and jail terms on violators. Some 200
frustrated speculators jumped on planes and trains for the
only remaining active stock market in Shanghai. The market
here recently centralized its business (mostly a bond market)
in new quarters, one building in which to clear trades that
previously had been handled by trading counters around town
that kept in touch by phone.
   Mr. Yang was waiting for the speculators. He used his bond
earnings to corner shares on the tiny stock market, in which
only seven companies are listed. Although no official records
are available in China, economists here believe Mr. Yang
quickly bought up enough shares to control prices, which
soared. In early July, the Shanghai market's composite index,
called the Jingan Index, was hovering just above 100 points.
Shortly after the speculators arrived, it cracked 150.
   Trading got so heated that Mr. Yang went into hiding.
Every time he got near a securities house, crowds of
speculators would surround him. He took refuge in the
converted movie-house balcony.
   As the index neared 180 points on Aug. 13, the government
put its anti-capitalist foot down in Shanghai, too. It
imposed 3% up-or-down daily limits on all shares. It also
ordered that stocks traded outside the exchange be
confiscated.
   Now, Mr. Yang waits for the government to see the error of
its ways. It isn't an entirely unpleasant or unprofitable
wait. With a steady 3%-a-day upward march, the Jingan index
currently is at about 400 points. "I can just sit back and
watch my stocks go up," he concedes. Lately, however, he is
said nevertheless to be doing trading of some sort out of a
small room off a back alleyway. So he isn't just twiddling
his thumbs.
   Mr. Yang takes the long view. He has had business cards
printed with the title he gives himself, "Professional Stock
Investor," and this slogan: "Willing to be the stone that
paves the road for the development of China's stock and
securities industry. Learn from the courage of those who dare
to eat crab, and conduct risky personal investment."
