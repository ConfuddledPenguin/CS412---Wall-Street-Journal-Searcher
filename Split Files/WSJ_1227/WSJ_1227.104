   Citrus growers and county agricultural officials in
central California's tri-county citrus belt urged county
officials to declare the region a disaster area after a week
of record low temperatures ravaged the navel orange crop.
   The declaration of a local disaster is the first step
toward seeking state and federal disaster relief.

   Growers also encouraged state agricultural officials to
lobby the state legislature to place a moratorium on the sale
or shipment of all San Joaquin Valley citrus produce this
year, similar to past practices in Texas and Florida, in
order to protect the reputation of citrus fruit produced in
the area.
   More than 65 growers, shippers and county officials
gathered in the County Agricultural Building to share horror
stories about what the coldest week since 1913 had done to
the 125 square miles of prime citrus groves at the base of
the Sierra mountain range.
   Carl A. "Skip" Pescosolido, 54 years old, a co-owner of
Sequoia Orange Co., in Exeter, Calif., which farms 5,000
acres of groves in the region, estimated the loss to the
company at $16 million. By the end of this week about 310, or
60%, of the 520 employees will be given work furloughs, he
said. Next week there will be more layoffs and job
reassignments, he added.
   "Somebody said it must be the greenhouse effect," said Mr.
Pescolido. "If anyone mentions the word greenhouse to me
again they're going to get a crooked nose."
   A spokesman for the California Citrus Mutual Association,
which represents about 800 growers in Fresno, Kern and Tulare
counties, said regional citrus crop damage estimates are
between $300 and $400 million.
   In Tulare County, the largest citrus-growing county in the
region, county agricultural officials said about 75% of the
navel orange crop was left on the trees and preliminary
estimates place losses at between $200 and $250 million.
   At the meeting, county officials and independent and
corporate growers planned to establish guidelines for
inspection of freeze-damaged fruit and to try to assess the
widespread damage to citrus crops.
   Fresno County agricultural officials said that 90% of the
county's annual $70 million citrus crop was still on the
trees when temperatures dipped to the mid-teens last week.
Across the region, growers attempted to flood groves, warm
roots with smudge pots and blow warm air in an attempt to
save crops and young trees, which also have reportedly been
damaged by the sub-freezing temperatures.
   "Old-timers haven't seen temperatures like this since a
similar cold spell in 1937, and baby-boom generation growers
have never experienced it," said Joel Nelson, the president
of the growers association, which is based in Visalia, Calif.
   Across the state, lemon, avocado, and valencia orange
crops have been damaged. Ventura County agricultural
officials place losses from lemon and avocado crops at $100
million, and Los Angeles County, though not as hard hit by
the bruising temperatures, places losses at $3 million.
