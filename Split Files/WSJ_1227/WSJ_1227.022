   CHICAGO -- After more than a week of price declines, grain
futures markets rallied on mildly encouraging news out of the
Soviet Union.
   Soybean futures led the rally, with a 4 3/4 cent increase
in the price of the March contract, which settled at $5.825 a
bushel. The corn contract for March delivery rose 1 3/4 cents
to $2.35 a bushel and the wheat contract for March delivery
rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.66 a bushel.

   Some grain futures prices had dropped to new contract lows
Friday and Monday, largely in response to the resignation of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and threats by
the head of the KGB that a crackdown might be necessary to
maintain order in the country. Traders worried that these
events might cause the Bush administration to balk at
granting the Soviets credit to buy U.S. grain.
   Yesterday, however, traders noted that the KGB had
softened its stance and the Soviet Congress had granted Prime
Minister Mikhail Gorbachev new powers, giving an indication
of some stability in the country. "It looked like Gorbachev
was at least still in charge," said Anne Frick, soybean
analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York. "I think that's
reassuring to the grain markets."
   The Bush administration has pledged to provide as much as
$1 billion in credits for food purchases by the
shortage-plagued Soviet Union and conceivably might grant
more credits early in the new year. Analysts say any retreat
to authoritarian rule in the Soviet Union might persuade the
U.S. to change its policy.
   Part of yesterday's rally was chalked up to a "technical
correction" after dramatic grain sell-offs last week.
Following six consecutive sessions of declines for soybean
futures, the market was due for a rally: "Price drops just
don't go forever with no correction," Ms. Frick said.
   Analysts said grain markets will be choppy and somewhat
aimless in the next few days, driven partly by continued news
out of the Soviet Union. Trading likely will be light through
the holiday season and leading up to Jan. 11, the day the
U.S. Agriculture Department will release a major crop report
that will include winter wheat planting figures, a grain
supply and demand report and the government's final crop
estimate of the season for soybeans.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum product prices rose in
extremely light trading. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude oil for February delivery ended at $27.22 a barrel, up
$1.30 from Friday. The Merc was closed Monday and Tuesday
because of the Christmas holiday. Yesterday's rise was
largely a catch-up response to action Monday on London's
International Petroleum Exchange, where Brent crudes rose
about $1 a barrel. Some aggressive war talk in the Middle
East contributed to yesterday's increase, as did technical
factors at the close of trading. Traders said heating oil
rose sharply, in part because cold weather finally hit the
East Coast. January heating oil finished at 81.26 cents a
gallon, up 2.32 cents. Gasoline rose in sympathy, with the
January contract up 1.90 cents to 68.14 cents a gallon.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. February delivery
gold gained $3.10 an ounce to $387.40. March silver advanced
seven cents an ounce to $4.1580. April platinum edged up 20
cents an ounce to $412.40. Uncertainty in the Persian Gulf,
which boosted crude oil prices, continued to create support
for gold, analysts said. That uncertainty, and light demand
for the metal, is likely to hold February gold at about $380
and over, one analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices advanced, with the March
contract rising 2.05 cents a pound to $1.1995. Some traders
bought contracts on reports that a surge of cold weather that
has moved into the Northwest part of the country may move
toward Florida more than a week from now, one analyst said.
The analyst added that the concerns were far-fetched, but
were stimulating demand anyway.
