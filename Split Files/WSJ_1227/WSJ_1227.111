   GORBACHEV CHOSE a conservative party bureaucrat to be his
vice president.
   Soviet legislators sat stunned when the president
announced his nominee, Gennady Yanayev, because many had
expected a choice calculated to smooth over the nation's
problems. Instead, Yanayev -- an opponent of radical economic
reform -- represents a thoroughly conservative voice.
Gorbachev defended Yanayev with irritation against a series
of charged questions from the lawmakers. The appointment was
Gorbachev's first in a new government structure that the
Congress of People's Deputies approved yesterday.

   THE CENSUS BUREAU ADDED 3.8 million more people to its
1990 headcount.
   Revising an earlier total from the summer, the bureau said
its almost-final tally from the 1990 census is 249,632,692
people, 10.2% more than the 1980 census found. But critics
complained that the bureau is still missing millions of
people. The new count will result in a shift of 19 seats in
the House of Representatives. California is the big winner,
adding seven seats, while New York will lose three seats.
   In the past decade, the population of the West has grown
by 22%, while the South grew by 13.5%, the Northeast by 3.4%
and the Midwest by 1.3%.

   The State Department ordered all "nonessential" U.S.
government employees, and all dependents of government
employees, to leave Jordan and Sudan. It urged all other
Americans to leave the two countries, whose governments
sympathize with Iraq, "well before" Jan. 15.
                                                                                                       

   Saddam Hussein said in Baghdad that the American army

on its side." In the Arabian Sea, meanwhile, U.S. sailors
boarded an Iraqi ship and were involved in a fracas with the
crew and international peace activists aboard the vessel.

1989 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini.

   Some Israeli lawmakers accused the government of risking
U.S. aid for the absorption of Soviet immigrants by erecting
new apartments in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But in
Washington, U.S. officials said Israel has assured them that
no immigrants will be directed to settle in new housing
projects in the disputed territories.
                                                                                                       

   Israel freed three Jewish guerrilla leaders after they had

Palestinians in the West Bank. Their supporters celebrated
outside the prison near Tel Aviv but critics staged a
protest, contending that Arabs routinely serve longer
sentences for lesser crimes committed against Jews.

brokered to reconcile the warring factions in Lebanon.

parliamentary elections in February.
