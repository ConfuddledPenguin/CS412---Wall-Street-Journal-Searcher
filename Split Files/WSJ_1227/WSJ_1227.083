   Nacco Industries Inc. said it expects to take a one-time
charge of $10.3 million, or $1.16 a share, in the fourth
quarter, due primarily to restructuring and plant closings
involving recently acquired businesses.
   Nacco, a fork-lift producer and consumer products and
mining concern, said in Cleveland that it expects to report a
modest profit for the quarter. In the year-ago fourth
quarter, net was $18.9 million, or $2.13 a share.

   Nacco said about $7.6 million of the charges reflect
restructuring at the company's 97%-owned Hyster-Yale
Materials Handling unit. The subsidiary is shutting a plant
in Brunswick, Ga., and relocating certain operations to a
North Carolina facility.
   The remaining charges stem from Nacco's 80%-owned Hamilton
Beach/Proctor-Silex unit, including charges for restructuring
operations.
