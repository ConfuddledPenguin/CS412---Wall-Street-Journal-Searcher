   PARIS -- The French unemployment rate rose to 9.0% of the
work force in November from 8.9% in October, according to
seasonally adjusted data from the Labor Ministry.
   The number of French job-seekers grew 0.5% to 2,535,500 in
November from 2,522,400 in October, the Ministry said. The
figure was also up 0.5% from November 1989.

   On an unadjusted basis, the number of job-seekers fell
0.2% to 2,582,500 in November from October, while the
unadjusted figure was up 0.2% from a year ago.
   The Ministry said the rise in job-seekers reflected
reduced hirings as economic growth slowed. The increase in
job-seekers also comes despite a 0.4% decline in the rate of
new entries in the job market and a 7.2% drop in the pace of
individuals returning to the work force after a prolonged
absence.
