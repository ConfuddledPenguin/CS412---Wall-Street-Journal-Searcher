   CHEVY CHASE, Md. -- Citing "fundamental differences"
between the company and shareholders, Greater Washington
Investors Inc. announced the resignation of several top
executives.
   Stephen W. Ritterbush, president and chief executive
officer, and Richard P. Whitney, senior vice president, have
resigned as officers and directors of the company. A group of
directors also resigned, comprising John E. Gray, David T.
Krausman, Hilliard W. Paige, Henry M. Ross, Charles Henry
Smith Jr. and Edmund W.E. Stein.

   GWI, the nation's second-oldest venture capital firm, said
that David L. Chandler, chairman of the board, will serve as
chief executive officer on an interim basis until a new
president is found. Mr. Chandler said the resignations were
the result of fundamental differences between the resigning
directors and the three remaining directors: himself, Rainer
H. Bosselmann and D. Irving Obrow, all of whom are associated
with Johnston Industries Inc.
   Johnston Industries, an operator of textile mills, is
GWI's largest shareholder; Mr. Chandler also is Johnston's
chairman and chief executive. In a Dec. 5 filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Johnston Industries said
it boosted its stake in GWI to 36.9% of the common shares
outstanding. At the time, Johnston didn't give a reason for
boosting its holdings.
   A spokeswoman for GWI declined to comment further on the
resignations or the differences between the outgoing
management and the shareholders, saying: "We've been
instructed not to comment."
