   Jay H. Shidler and Robert W. Holman Jr., two Honolulu real
estate investors, said they may propose various restructuring
alternatives for Grossman's Inc.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the
investors also said they might launch a proxy fight for the
board at the 1991 annual meeting of the Braintree, Mass.,
home-improvement retailer.

   Grossman's officials couldn't be reached for comment.
Earlier this year, the Shidler-Holman group launched an
unsuccessful bid to unseat Grossman's board.
   The group also said it has been in discussions with
Grossman's senior management about gaining representation on
Grossman's board. The filing said the board indicated that it
would agree to one representative of the group being
appointed if the group would enter into a long-term
standstill agreement. The group, feels, however, that the
board's position is not in stockholders' best interest.
