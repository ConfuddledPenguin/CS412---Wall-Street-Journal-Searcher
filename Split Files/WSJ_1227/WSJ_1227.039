   There were holiday seasons back in the 1930s when the
atmosphere was much gloomier. Men were standing on street
corners selling apples for a nickel and finding buyers not so
much because the buyers were charitable as because they were
hungry. Ice-cream cones and, in some farm areas, even quarts
of milk sold for a nickel, a coin that had a real value in
those unhappy days.
   There is gloom now, of course, but perhaps even more
apprehension. The apprehension, moreover, has been strong for
nearly five years. The economy slowed sharply in early 1986,
and the inflation-adjusted gross national product actually
declined in the second quarter of that year.

   The Federal Reserve stepped on the monetary accelerator
for a while, but it soon became worried as inflation heated
up. A return to tight money may or may not have contributed
to the stock market crash of October 1987, but the crash
convinced many people that the recession was upon us. The Fed
calmed the panic by easing for a time, but soon it was on its
new track of gradual restraint.
   The economy was going almost nowhere through 1988, 1989
and 1990. Any quarter with a GNP growth rate of more than 1%
began to be regarded as a relatively robust period.
Businessmen, expecting growth to become even slower, cut back
on hiring and stepped up layoffs.
   Companies watched their inventories more closely, too.
Many began reducing borrowing and trying to pay off some old
debts, trying to get their balance sheets into better shape.
This made individual companies look better, but it didn't
stimulate a lot of economic growth.
   If a recession now is under way or about to start, U.S.
business this time has developed an unusual way to approach
it. "In the past," says Stephen Roach, a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
economist, "businesses have been slow in coming to grips with
the reality of recession -- waiting until the weakening of
demand was in full swing before biting the bullet on
layoffs."
   For example, manufacturing employment typically has risen
more than 2% in the final year of an expansion. In the past
year, by contrast, factory jobs have decreased 2%.
Manufacturers' efforts at cost-containment were also spurred
by their determination to become more competitive with
foreign firms.
   Hanging on to employees until the last minute in prior
recessions had meant that manufacturing productivity usually
declined in the recession, hurting U.S. competitiveness. The
different approach this time has meant that manufacturing
productivity rose 3.9% in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, a
period many analysts think will include the latest cyclical
peak in the U.S. economy. After juggling the figures a couple
of times, the Commerce Department now says inflation-adjusted
GNP rose by only 1.4% in the third quarter. Mr. Roach has
decreased his estimate for the current quarter; he now
expects real GNP to fall at a 3.6% annual rate, compared with
an earlier forecast of a 2.6% decrease.
   The strong productivity growth in manufacturing is one
reason Mr. Roach expects the recession to be fairly mild,
with real GNP declining at an annual rate of only 1% in the
first half of 1991 and then picking up smartly in the third
quarter, rising at an annual rate of 3.7%.
   Unfortunately, the services industries aren't likely to be
much help. Services kept the economy growing through much of
the 1980s, while manufacturing was struggling to make headway
against foreign competition. But service productivity, never
very good, has gotten worse as the economy as weakened.
   The major reason for services' poorer performance shows up
in hiring patterns. Service industries slowed their hiring in
the year before the assumed business cycle peak in the 1990
third quarter, but not nearly as much as manufacturers did.
The services slowdown, says Mr. Roach, "was totally
insufficient to generate any measurable improvements in
service-sector productivity. Thus, services remain trapped in
a quagmire of inefficiency."
   This could mean that the recession will be America's first
white-collar slump, with manufacturing continuing to do
fairly well. The recession also could put pressure on service
industries to do more to improve their productivity.
   The slowdown in service employment growth in the past year
has been mainly in managerial and professional positions.
There has been little change in the hiring pace in technical,
sales and support occupations. "From the standpoint of
productivity enhancement," Mr. Roach says, "this result
remains puzzling -- especially for services, where intensive
reliance on the labor-saving potential of information
technology should have been more successful in reducing the
back-office content of its white-collar work force."
   So we've been expecting this recession for nearly five
years and manufacturers have done a reasonably good job of
preparing for it. Now if someone could figure out a way to
make service companies more efficient, maybe we would do a
better overall job of dealing with downturns.
