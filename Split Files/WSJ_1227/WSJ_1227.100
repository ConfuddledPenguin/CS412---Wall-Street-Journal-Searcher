   A group including Heine Securities Corp. of Short Hills,
N.J., and Michael F. Price said it asked Society For Savings
Bancorp Inc. to add individuals who aren't members of
management to the board.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group
said it reserves the right to take action to obtain board
representation if it is not otherwise offered.

   The filing said the group met with the new chairman of
Society For Savings on Dec. 19 to reiterate its view that the
company could enhance shareholder values by spinning off its
consumer finance subsidiary, Fidelity Acceptance Corp.
   Society for Savings, Hartford, Conn., couldn't be reached
for comment.
