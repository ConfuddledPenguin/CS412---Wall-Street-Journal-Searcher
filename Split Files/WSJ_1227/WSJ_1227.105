   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- County Bank named Roy G. Green,
its president and chief executive officer, to the additional
post of chairman, as part of a management and financial
reorganization of the savings bank.
   Mr. Green succeeds William J. Levy, the company's largest
shareholder with a more than 25% stake. Mr. Levy along with
business partner Roy Millender, who holds about a 9% stake,
resigned from the board but will retain their ownership
interests in the bank, and intend to buy shares in a coming
preferred stock issue, the company said.

   "It has become increasingly clear to me that, in this
demanding environment, it makes sense that County be led by
an experienced banker with Roy Green's background and
skills," Mr. Levy said. Mr. Green joined County Bank in 1987
after serving as president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas.
   County Bank also said it completed the conversion of
$22.15 million in long-term subordinated debt to preferred
stock, "a move which significantly improved the bank's
current core capital position to 2.3%," the company said.
County said it submitted a new capital plan to the Office of
Thrift Supervision last month that includes a "significantly
higher" level of reserves, more conservative real estate
valuations and a higher core capital goal of 5%.
