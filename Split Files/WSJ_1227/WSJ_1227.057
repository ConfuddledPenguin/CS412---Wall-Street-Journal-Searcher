   NEW YORK -- Total short interest in over-the-counter
stocks moved down in the latest month after leaping in the
prior month to record levels.
   Short interest among the largest OTC stocks fell back 2.3%
for the month through mid-December, and the level among
smaller issues fell 5.4%. Combined short interest for large
and small OTC issues was nearly 329 million shares, down from
the record volume of 342.5 million originally reported for
the prior month.

   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been
purchased for return to lenders.
   First Executive Corp. led the list of companies showing
short interest, with nearly 5.8 million shares. But short
interest in the insurance company's shares actually declined
5% from November. First Executive invested heavily in junk
bonds over several years, and has been struggling with a weak
portfolio.
   Significant increases in short positions occurred in
several computer and technology issues -- Oracle Systems
Corp., Adobe Systems Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. Short
interest in Apple shares had doubled in the mid-November
month, as investors feared a bad earnings report. But more
recently the stock had rebounded; the past month's increase
suggests further betting on another slide in the shares.
Semiconductor and disk-drive issues generally have been under
selling pressure.
   The biggest single volume increase was in Medco
Containment Services Inc., a provider of prescription-by-mail
services for pharmaceuticals. It saw short interest climb to
2.3 million shares from 1.2 million the month earlier. Also,
New England Critical Care Inc.'s short interest rose to 1.4
million shares from 834,000 a month earlier. The company
provides home-based therapy services.
   Some stock fund managers have been trimming their
portfolios of health-care stocks, but they still see these
kinds of companies as a relative haven in hard economic
times.
   Among issues with decreasing short interest volumes, MCI
Communications Corp. led with an 875,000-share drop to a
total of 1.3 million. The company's stock has fallen
substantially in recent months, and analysts see some
bottoming-out of the decline.
   Although a substantial short position reflects heavy
speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors
consider an increase in short interest bullish because the
borrowed shares eventually must be bought back.
   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade
on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.
   The NASD reported that short interest in 2,258 National
Market System issues, the largest OTC stocks, totaled 292.6
million shares at mid-December, down from a revised 299.4
million in mid-November among 2,267 shares.
   Short interest in 1,181 smaller securities traded on
Nasdaq declined to 36.3 million shares for December from a
revised 38.3 million for November among 1,197 issues.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-December fell to 3.12 from 3.29 a month earlier, while
the short-interest ratio for other OTC issues declined to
1.29 from 1.51 a month earlier.
   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.
