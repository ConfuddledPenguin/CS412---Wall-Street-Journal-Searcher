   RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Patrick Williams knew the downturn
had arrived when his business jumped 50% last month from a
year earlier.

   "We're filing more claims now than we ever have before,"
says Mr. Williams, whose lobby has been so crowded lately
with laid-off construction and factory workers that his staff
is processing them in groups rather than individually.
   Growing unemployment lines may be commonplace in much of
the country, but they are shocking to California's
fastest-growing region, the self-proclaimed "Inland Empire"
of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Here, population
soared an astonishing 60% in the past decade as Los Angelenos
migrated eastward in search of reasonably priced housing, and
jobs followed. With 2.5 million people now living in the
region, the phone company is considering giving it its own
area code.
   Rapid growth has driven California out of -- or even
around -- past slumps. But this time, the growth engine is
stalling.
   "I'm not so sure we can rely on the Golden State's golden
past to carry us through this recession," says Riverside
County Supervisor Kay Ceniceros, who worries that the local
economy has become too dependent on a single industry,
construction.
   Although building is slumping throughout California, the
effects of the slide are most pronounced in the Inland
Empire, which was transformed almost overnight into
sprawling, tile-roofed suburbias replete with strip malls and
drive-through restaurants.
   The region's roots were in agriculture. The navel orange
was developed in Riverside, and California's first vineyard
was in nearby Ontario. The area also was known for its
transportation arteries: The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe cut
through here, and famous Route 66 winds through San
Bernardino on its way to Chicago. The Hollywood set helped
establish the Inland Empire as a weekend spot, with sunning
in Palm Springs and skiing in the mountain resorts of Lake
Arrowhead and Big Bear.
   But not until the 1980s, when the price of much California
real estate shot into the stratosphere, did the Inland Empire
take off. Just as Orange County blossomed in the 1970s as a
bedroom community of Los Angeles, this area mushroomed in the
1980s. Moreno Valley, a suburb east of Riverside with 116,000
people, had scarcely any inhabitants a decade ago.
   About 10% of the workers in the Inland Empire -- some
71,000 people -- are in construction, and they are suffering
the most. The number of building permits for new houses has
dropped more than 30% from 1989, and home sales have fallen
an equal amount. Layoffs in construction and related
industries helped lift the region's unemployment rate to 7.1%
in October, well above the statewide rate of 6% and above the
national rate as well.
   "I remember going to meetings of office-park developers in
other parts of the country and hearing how bad things were
going. But we just didn't see it," says Willard W. "Skip"
Morris, president of a Chevron Corp. unit that has been
transforming the old Ontario Motor Speedway into a business
and housing development. "It wasn't until the early part of
this year that we saw we'd have many of the same types of
problems here."
   Joseph L. Borrie, a Riverside bankruptcy attorney, has
been sought out by more and more small-business owners in
recent weeks. "I just had four separate furniture stores file
within a week and a half of one another, and they were all
established businesses," he says. "I think there's going to
be a horrible flood of filings after the holidays."
   Growth in the Inland Empire hasn't stopped, of course; it
has just slowed down. In fact, economists say the region is
probably the best-positioned in Southern California to
weather a recession. "Compared with the rest of the state and
the nation, the outlook for the Riverside-San Bernardino
metropolitan area is highly positive," says Phillip Vincent,
a First Interstate Bancorp economist.
   Wages here are well below those of Los Angeles and Orange
counties -- as much as 35% lower, according to one survey --
and that, along with the ample supply of jobseekers, will
keep new businesses coming in. With the average home price of
$146,255 in November -- compared with $225,600 in Los Angeles
and $239,671 in Orange County -- growth will eventually pick
up again. Even with the drop in construction, some 25,000
single-family homes were built here this year, more than in
any other metropolitan area in the nation.
   "The Inland Empire will be the last area to go into the
recession and the first to come out," boasts Inland Empire
Economic Council President Steve Pon-Tell.
   Nonetheless, the prospect of being first out offers little
comfort to people now caught in the undertow.
   "Basically, the name of the game is survival," says Donald
Billetts, who has slashed the staff at his J.D. Trim
finished-carpentry firm in Chino to 45 from 70 in the past
year to cope with a 50% drop in new business. "My banker
asked what my bottom line will be this year. I told him if
I'm lucky, it'll be zero."
   Peter Olah has laid off more than half the staff of his
excavation company in Upland and briefly considered closing
down temporarily. Steven Alexander, executive vice president
of Superior Electrical Contractors in Redlands, had to slash
his staff to 45 from 150 and is moving his headquarters to an
old house to save on rent. And Paul Friedman had to stop
building a 462-unit housing tract in Lake Elsinore when
financing dried up.
   "Of our four lenders, one was taken over by the RTC {the
federal Resolution Trust Corp.}, one filed for Chapter 11,
the third went out of business just as they were processing
our loan, and the fourth was taken over by another company
that wouldn't lend," Mr. Friedman complains.
   Without the $4 million needed to start construction, his
projected community is nothing more than rows of graded lots
gouged out of a lifeless hillside. Mr. Friedman also is
having trouble paying subcontractors. "We normally pay them
in 30 days or less," he says. "Now we're double that. And
we're some of the good guys."
   Like shockwaves from the San Andreas fault, which bisects
the region, the homebuilding slump has jolted the local
economy, leveling some businesses while sparing others. "A
disproportionately large percentage of the economy is being
affected by the slowdown in construction, whether you sell
drapes, build cabinets or do landscaping," says Stephen
Albright, president of a nonprofit company that tries to
bring employers into the Riverside area.
   The downturn has been particularly hard on the Deleo
family. Joe Deleo makes clay roof tiles at a small factory in
Lake Elsinore. Business "stinks," the gruff, 76-year-old
family patriarch says. He has fired his sales staff and may
have to idle one of the plant's two kilns. Fifteen miles up
the road, Mr. Deleo's son and grandson are watching their
Corona Clay Co. crumble. Brick and pipe makers have stopped
ordering clay, contractors are failing to pay for orders
filled months ago, and the company laid off about 20 workers.
   Surprisingly, retailers here don't seem to be suffering
nearly as much as those elsewhere in the country, partly
because new shopping centers haven't been added as fast as
the population has grown. Harris Co., a San Bernardino
department-store chain with eight locations, is still posting
"healthy increases" in sales, says Geoff Engel, a vice
president.
   In addition, companies that specialize in heavy
construction, such as San Bernardino-based Kasler Corp., are
benefiting from much-needed additions to local roads and
similar projects. And industrial and commercial developers
haven't been as hard hit as homebuilders. Sales and leasing
of industrial space in the third quarter totaled 4.3 million
square feet, up from 2.8 million a year earlier.
   Demand is still strong for the lowest-priced homes, which
sell for under $100,000 in Victorville and Adelanto, some 90
miles from downtown Los Angeles. H. Lawrence Webb, who
oversees Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp.'s activities in the
Inland Empire, says that although move-up housing is a tough
sell, "affordable housing is selling well."
   However, not all those buying cheaper housing are
first-time buyers. Robert Chamberlain, relocation coordinator
for Associated Van &amp; Storage in San Bernardino, says, "People
are downgrading their homes, moving from a $200,000 house to
a $150,000 house." He says business has been brisk lately
because "our busiest times are during recessions. It's kind
of sad, but that's the way it is."
   Manufacturers here are also feeling the pinch. The Inland
Empire is a center for recreational-vehicle and mobile-home
manufacturers, which have been suffering from a sales slump.
Riverside-based Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., which employs
2,000 people here, is cutting its workers' hours and giving
them "a little more time off" during the holidays, after
earnings in its Oct. 28 quarter fell 50%. Other RV firms are
laying off hundreds of employees.
   Defense and military workers have it tough, too. General
Dynamics Corp. will lay off 2,800 missile-plant employees in
the area over the next year. Other defense contractors are
considering cuts, and newer plants in the Inland Empire could
be hit harder than older ones in Los Angeles and Orange
counties, First Interstate's Mr. Vincent says.
   Looming on the horizon, the Air Force plans to close
Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino and George Air Force
Base near Victorville by mid-decade, wiping out as many as
12,000 civilian and military jobs. And that doesn't include
the three local jobs that economists say could be lost for
every one at the bases.
   The blow could be softened if the Air Force selects March
Air Force Base in nearby Moreno Valley for its Space Systems
Division, bringing in 7,500 jobs and allowing another 2,500
employees to keep working at Norton. Last summer, moreover,
Lockheed Corp. agreed to locate part of its
commercial-airplane maintenance business to a hangar on the
base.
   Local officials hope that, with retraining, some laid-off
aerospace workers can find other manufacturing jobs. "We
still have new companies moving in," says John Mooney,
director of Ontario's Employment Training Agency. Among the
newcomers is Exquisite Form, a brassiere maker that plans to
offer 100 jobs. However, he concedes that machinists used to
making missiles for $20 an hour aren't likely to become bra
makers for $5 an hour.
   Just how bad the area downturn looks depends on one's
perspective. Ralph Menga, deputy director of Riverside's
Development Department, left a Little Rock, Ark., development
firm to move here last year. Compared with Little Rock, where
"six of the seven lending institutions in the city were
either bankrupt or in the hands of the federal regulators,"
the Inland Empire seems to be upholding the California myth
of a recession-proof economy, Mr. Menga says. "Things are
certainly slowing here, but it's nowhere near as bad as
around the rest of the country," he adds.
