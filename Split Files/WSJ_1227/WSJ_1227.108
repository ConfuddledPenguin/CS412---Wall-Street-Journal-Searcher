   For the year, the Salt Lake City-based company said net
income, on the strength of an agreement with a hospital chain
in Northern California, rose to $377,000, or one cent a
share, compared with a loss of $1.7 million, or seven cents a
share, a year ago.
   The company, which provides data processing systems and
computer software equipment for the health-care industry,
said annual revenue increased 43% to $12.8 million from $8.9
million.
   A spokesman said the increased yearly sales represent a
data system and software package accepted for use at 14
Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers in Northern California. The
medical centers are units of Kaiser Foundation Hospital.
