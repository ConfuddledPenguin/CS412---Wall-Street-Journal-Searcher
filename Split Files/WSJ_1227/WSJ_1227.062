   NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Board approved an alliance
between Swiss Bank Corp. and the big Chicago options firm,
O'Connor Partners.
   The alliance between Triple-A rated Swiss Bank and
O'Connor marks another entry into the highly profitable
business of creating customized futures and options on
stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies for investors.

   Swiss Bank will tap O'Connor's trading talent and
technology, while O'Connor, a secretive proprietary trading
firm, will gain exposure to new clients through Swiss Bank's
franchise.
   The new unit will be called SBC/OC Services L.P., and will
be jointly owned by Swiss Bank and O'Connor Partners.
   The Federal Reserve Board announced the approval late last
week.
