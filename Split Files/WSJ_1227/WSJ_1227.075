   CHICAGO -- The hard-knocks recession that has been
squeezing New York's securities industry all year is
producing much less pain in Chicago's financial district.
   The Windy City's financial fortunes are based on futures
and options trading, rather than on stocks and bonds,
investment banking and corporate takeovers. And these days,
with the U.S. economy sinking and war clouds building, that
is a crucial difference. Indeed, the bad economic news is
attracting some investors to the futures markets. The two
biggest futures exchanges are in Chicago.

   As Wall Street brokerage houses limp along on low profits,
laying off brokers and slashing year-end executive bonuses,
some Chicago futures firms are expanding. "The health of the
Chicago futures industry at the moment is considerably better
than the health of Wall Street," declares Perrin Long, an
analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. who watches
the securities industry.
   Unlike many on Wall Street, futures traders haven't curbed
their spending habits. Traders still flock to Chicago's East
Bank Club when the futures markets close, and new club
memberships are selling briskly at about $2,000 a year. At
Carlos, a French restaurant on Chicago's posh North Shore,
more traders, not fewer, are ordering $100 dinners. "When we
call to confirm reservations, we can hear the roar of the
trading pits in the background," a manager there says.
   Futures trading volume has surged this year --
particularly in contracts based on long-term interest rates,
foreign currencies, the stock market and oil. At the Chicago
Board of Trade, more than 150 million contracts have changed
hands this year, an unprecedented total at this or any other
futures exchange. Last year's volume was 138 million
contracts. At the New York Mercantile Exchange -- the third
largest futures market, where petroleum futures are traded --
volume is up 9% to nearly 42 million contracts this year from
38.5 million in 1989.
   Futures contracts are designed for use in risk-management
strategies known as hedging, and the need to ward off
financial risk tends to increase when the economy goes south.
This demand for futures benefits both the companies that help
investors manage risk and speculators, who try to make money
by guessing which way futures prices are headed and then
riding the wave. For these gunslingers, volatility created by
an uncertain economy can provide opportunity for big scores.
   Consider, for example, a Friday afternoon shortly after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Surging oil prices were unnerving
traders already wary of recession. At the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, prices of futures contracts based on the stock
market were plummeting. Then, a news service reported that
Iraq had pledged to withdraw within days, and suddenly stock
prices bottomed out. While most traders were still
frantically selling stock-index futures, traders for Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. started buying. Ten minutes later, everyone was
buying: Stock-index futures prices jumped by about $5,000 a
contract, and Bear Stearns made a killing.
   Of course, the futures industry isn't escaping recession
entirely. The Chicago Merc's trading volume actually is down
about 2% from 1989's record, and the Merc has announced it
will eliminate 52 staff jobs through attrition in 1991. One
likely explanation: The Merc's biggest contract -- the
Eurodollar future -- is designed to hedge against risk of
unfavorable swings in short-term interest rates. Short-term
rates, economists note, haven't been as volatile this year as
long-term rates. As a result, some of last year's Eurodollar
business has moved down the street to the Board of Trade,
where contracts based on long-term interest rates are traded.
   In addition, despite increased demand for futures
contracts from big investors, profits have been shaved
somewhat by commission competition among the companies that
help investors manage risk. "You've got very bright money
managers and institutional managers out there looking for the
best deal," says John Danguard, president of the Futures
Industry Association.
   Nevertheless, for most futures firms based in Chicago,
business is good. This fall, while New York brokerages were
handing out pink slips, the managing partner of Chicago-based
Rosenthal Collins Group decided the time was right to expand.
In October, with his request for $50 million in loans from a
Dutch bank granted despite the slowing economy, Leslie
Rosenthal opened a new futures company called Quantum
Financial Services Inc.
   "We obviously would have some trouble if this becomes a
deep, lasting recession and (investors) pull in their horns,"
Mr. Rosenthal says. "But if it's relatively short, it will
help us a lot."
   Robust futures operations also are helping some Wall
Street firms offset weakness in other areas. Among these
firms, analysts say, are Merrill Lynch, with a large
institutional hedging business; Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., with
big profits in both hedging and arbitrage; Salomon Inc., with
its Phibro Energy unit, which helps clients hedge against
oil-price swings; and, to a lesser degree, Bear Stearns.
   Richard L. Sandor, a key figure in developing the first
financial futures contract, says recession hurts futures
markets less than other segments of the financial industry
because futures contracts themselves cover a broad range of
financial activity.
   "An industry with 50 to 100 different products is less
vulnerable to the general level of economic activity than a
specialized market," says Mr. Sandor, president of Indosuez
International Capital Markets. "If equities are weak, you may
have strength in energy. If bonds are weak, there may be
demand for currency contracts."
   Even so, demand for memberships on futures exchanges --
which entitle their owners to do their own trades, and which
are bought and sold at fluctuating pricesis somewhat
sluggish. Of the three biggest futures exchanges, only the
New York Merc's membership prices are higher than they were
six months ago, rising to about $310,000 this month from
about $200,000 in June.
   At the Chicago Merc, seats that sold for about $490,000 in
June are now selling for about $375,000. At the Board of
Trade, seat prices have declined less sharply, from about
$325,000 in June to about $315,000 this month.
   One reason for the sluggish demand for exchange
memberships is that institutional investors who use futures
to hedge don't necessarily need to do their own trading. "The
institutions already know how to use the markets," says the
Futures Industry Association's Mr. Danguard. "They clear
their trades through someone else."
