   YOUGHAL, Ireland -- Content, as many nonbelievers are, to
spend at least one day a year going through the motions of
religious observance in a church, I spent an hour on
Christmas morning in St. Mary's, reflecting upon tolerance
and the injuries inflicted by fanaticism.
   The stones of St. Mary's Collegiate Church here in this
old town, halfway along Ireland's south coast, speak
eloquently enough on the topic of toleration and its absence.
The church was founded in the 11th century, re-edified by
Thomas, eighth Earl of Desmond in 1468, then pillaged by his
descendant, the 16th earl, in the Geraldine revolt in 1579.
The 16th earl, insurgent against the Norman occupiers,
supposedly stabled his horses in the church, though this
could well have been Norman propaganda.

   In 1649 Oliver Cromwell, subduing Catholic Ireland,
quartered his army in Youghal and was greeted by the prudent
townsfolk with the same enthusiasm with which they
subsequently welcomed the return to the throne of Charles II.
When I was growing up the Protestant congregation was sparse,
mustering under a hundred even at Christmas, in a place that
could hold over a thousand.
   As I listened, this Christmas morning, to triumphant
recitations from scripture about the birth of the Christ
child, my thoughts were mostly on a triumph scored not by
Christianity but by Islam.
   On Christmas Eve came news that seemed to suggest that the
fatwa, or sentence of death decreed by the late Ayatollah
Khomeini against the novelist Salman Rushdie for blasphemy,
had taken its toll.
   In Britain Hesham el Essawy, chairman of the Islamic
Society for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance, announced
that "Salman Rushdie has now embraced the Islamic faith for
the first time. That means that under Islamic law the slate
must be wiped clean and his past sins forgiven." Mr. Essawy,
a dentist by profession and critical of the fatwa, was
careful to add that "some people are suggesting that Mr.
Rushdie has issued such a statement now to save his skin, but
I know that he is a man whose arm cannot be twisted. What he
says is what he believes. I also know that his conversion was
not accomplished yesterday but two months ago."
   In telephone interviews after this announcement, Mr.
Rushdie was quoted by the Times of London for Dec. 26 as
saying (in the reporter's words) that he "accepted that there
is no God but Allah and that Mohammed was his last prophet."
Mr. Rushdie said he would not be publishing a paperback
version of "The Satanic Verses" -- the novel that caused
offense in the first place -- and said (in his own words)
that "I declare that I do not agree with any statement in my
novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any of the characters
who insult the prophet Mohammed or who cast aspersions on
Islam or upon the authenticity of the Holy Koran or who
reject the divinity of Allah."
   It was not clear the day after Christmas whether the
mullahs in Teheran would say it was fine for Mr. Rushdie to
come out of hiding, but they must be feeling satisfied by his
protestations.
   All in all it was a good couple of days for militant
Islam, since French soldiers serving in the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia were unable to conduct
public Christian devotions for fear of offending the Saudis.
British soldiers wanting to partake in Christian services had
-- for similar reasons -- to go to Bahrain to do so.
Apparently the American cantonments were sufficiently large
to permit secluded and furtive religious celebration of
Christmas without affront to Islamic propriety.
   My gloom at the toll taken in these instances by the
forces of superstition was deepened by the lesson at that
point being read from the lectern in St. Mary's. It was taken
from one of St. Paul's distasteful letters in which the
precepts of a presumptively historical, humane and human
Jesus were perverted into intolerant doctrine. I was reminded
of a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to John Adams:
   "Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him {Jesus}
by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination,
correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and
others, again, of so much ignorance, of so much absurdity, so
much untruth and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible
that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same
being. I separate, therefore, the gold from the dross,
restore to him the former, and leave the latter to the
stupidity of some and the roguery of others of his
disciples." Jefferson rightly called Paul "the first
corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus."
   The profile of Jesus I've always found alluring is that of
the human character drawn by Moncure Conway, in his 1906
memoir "My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East." Conway
came to the conclusion, after much scholarly study of
Christian texts and their precedents in Buddhist and
Zoroastrian writings, that the Jesus of the Gospels and of
St. Paul masked a very different historical character:
   "He whom Church traditions have without scriptural warrant
represented as a sort of peasant surrounded by peasant
disciples, was on the contrary a gentleman of local
distinction, enjoying the friendship of high personages,
including Pilate and his wife, and that he gathered around
him a number of anti-sacrifice reformers large enough to
protect him in driving the animals out of the temple." Conway
emphasized that in its original version, Christ's attack on
the moneychangers in the temple ("a legitimate business") was
in fact an assault on the crudities of animal sacrifice. For
Conway, Paul "corrupted the morals of the religious
movement." Paul's "immeasurable crime" was to restore in the
form of Jesus himself the sacrificial victims Jesus drove
from the temple: "It is due to Paul that Christianity rests
upon a human sacrifice."
   Were the narratives about Christ read as though dug up in
Persia and related to Zoroaster, Conway wrote, "we should
find in them a gentleman, traditionally of high birth,
educated, and in the best sense a man of the world. He eats
and drinks with personages of rank, admires the Greeks,
exalts cosmopolitan Solomon and the `Gentile' Queen of Sheba
above the provincial sectarians of his time, and repudiates
priesthood, sacrifices, sabbath, and pharisaic morality. His
familiarity with refined and polite social life appears in
poetic parables and metaphors . . . a lost pearl, masters of
fields and vineyards, wedding garments, royal ambassadors,
precedence at feasts, the fine robe and ring, and the fatted
calf."
   The civilized individual portrayed by Conway was
transmuted into an accouterment of a religion that has
brought untold suffering upon the world, with cruelties
inflicted in the name of Christian love that far outstrip
horrors done in the name of Islam. In this perspective
Christmas Eve did not seem an entirely inappropriate day for
Mr. Rushdie to have made his penitential march to the Islamic
equivalent of Canossa. In truth, as the poet Lucretius wrote,
"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum." How great are the
evils that religion has managed to inflict]
