   Forget about Eastern Europe, "personalized" marketing and
Japan's emergence as an international advertising force.
   Those hot topics on Madison Avenue during 1990 will move
to the back burner as we ring in the new year. The hottest
issue in 1991: surviving the "Big R."

   Top ad agency executives, gazing into their crystal balls,
say the recession not only will slash companies' ad
expenditures and agency staff levels. It also will spark an
ad-industry crackdown on slow-paying clients, a rise in
client defections and an expansion of hard-sell marketing
techniques.
   "We're dealing with a very tough marketplace out there,"
says Carl Spielvogel, chairman of Backer Spielvogel Bates
Worldwide, a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi unit. Stanley Katz, chairman
and chief executive officer of Foote Cone &amp; Belding's New
York operation, concurs: "Everything is going to get tougher,
not better. If there's a danger sign ahead in 1991, it's an
overreaction to that" by agencies and clients.
   Here's how ad-industry leaders see the recession fallout
shaping up:
                                                                                                       

   Agencies will get tougher with their clients, curbing
generous credit terms for financially shaky companies and
shunning low-paying new accounts.
   During good times, agencies paid scant attention to how
slowly some clients paid their bills. No longer. With profit
margins squeezed, "agencies will watch their receivables like
they have never watched them before," says William Weithas,
chairman and chief executive of Lintas: Worldwide, an
Interpublic Group unit. "No businessman wants to take the
risk of doing business with either insolvent or low-rated
companies," he explains.
   For example, WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson relinquished
Health &amp; Tennis Corp.'s $50 million media account last month
after the unit of financially troubled Bally Manufacturing
refused to pay cash up front for media buys.
   In another sign of today's glum times, several major
agencies refused to bid for Trans World Airlines' $45 million
ad account this fall because the airline offered unusually
low compensation. Will agencies spurn TWA-type deals again?
"You can bet your life" they will, Mr. Weithas says. Ad
people "aren't going to give (their services) away."
                                                                                                       

   More jittery advertisers will dump their agencies,
snowballing this year's flurry of account switches.
   "Historically, more clients jump ship in bad times because
they get harder-nosed and say, `I want results,'" observes
Foote Cone's Mr. Katz.
   The greatest movement likely will come from industries in
the deepest trouble, such as retailing, financial services
and cars. Earlier this month, Montgomery Ward dropped Saffer
USA in favor of the Chicago office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp;
Bowles for its estimated $25 million to $30 million account.
Similarly, Chase Manhattan named Wells, Rich, Greene its lead
agency for more than $35 million in ad billings -- largely
forsaking Scali, McCabe, Sloves, the WPP Group unit that had
handled the majority of the account.
   Agency heads say they're hustling more aggressively for
new business because of the threat of defections and because
so many existing clients have trimmed their agency fees or ad
budgets.
                                                                                                       

   A stronger push for results will tilt the ad-spending
pendulum more toward promotions and spur advertisers to be
less daring in their campaigns.
   An expected slowdown in spending on coupons, contests,
sweepstakes and other short-term promotions never
materialized this year. Instead, companies worried about the
sour economy will keep shifting bucks away from traditional
media advertising because they can measure results faster
with promotions. Clients "feel they can't take any chances.
They need to get sales now," says Burton Manning, chairman of
J. Walter Thompson.
   Direct-mail expenditures, for example, should climb 6.5%
during 1991, a faster clip than any other ad category and
less than the scant 4.6% for all U.S. ad spending, predicts
Robert J. Coen, a McCann-Erickson senior vice president and
the ad industry's leading agency forecaster.
   The recession also will breed caution. Clients are
abandoning wildly creative ads and flighty corporate-image
drives in favor of "tried-and-true" techniques such as ads
focused on price cuts. "There will be a temptation to do a
lot more `me-too' advertising," notes JWT's Mr. Manning. He
and other agency chiefs find this strategy flawed. An
unexpected, startling or controversial ad is "the stuff that
sells the merchandise," he insists. But clients' interest in
unconventional approaches, he admits, "goes away in a
recession."

   STAFF MEETING: Banc One Corp. plans an unusual "staff
meeting," a 60-second spot to be aired on national TV on New
Year's morning. The Columbus, Ohio, bank holding company is
mailing memos to its 29,000 U.S. employees urging them to
tune in. During the ad, to be broadcast on CBS during the
Cotton Bowl Parade, Chairman and Chief Executive John B.
McCoy will discuss a new marketing effort. Details will come
Jan. 2 at the company's 747 offices. A Banc One spokesman
said the spot also may serve as a teaser for a related ad
campaign, scheduled to break at the end of January. Martin
Agency, Richmond, Va., created the ad.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: The American Arbitration Association named
Alden Group, New York, to handle its new ad account. Billings
weren't disclosed. The New York-based association, which
mediates disputes, has done little advertising in the past.
