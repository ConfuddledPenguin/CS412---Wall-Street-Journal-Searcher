   Federal regulators cleared CenTra Inc., a closely held
Warren, Mich., trucking and transportation concern, to
acquire as much as 24.9% of Citizens Banking Corp.
   Citizens said the ruling allows CenTra to be a passive
investor in the bank holding company but restricts the amount
of influence the trucking company can wield.

   CenTra agreed, among other things, "not to exercise, or
attempt to exercise, a controlling influence over the
management or policies of Citizens or its bank subsidiaries,"
the Flint, Mich., company said.
   CenTra, a longtime investor in Citizens, said it is
interested in the bank strictly as an investment. CenTra owns
nearly 10%, or 664,000, of Citizens' 6.6 million shares
outstanding. Citizens shares closed unchanged at $18.625 in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
