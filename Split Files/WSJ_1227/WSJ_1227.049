   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and the Chicago Board
Options Exchange resolved a squabble over a licensing
arrangement covering S&amp;P stock indexes.
   S&amp;P, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., sued the CBOE in
November, charging the options exchange with breach of a
ten-year licensing pact, signed in 1983, under which the CBOE
was granted exclusive right to use the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500
indexes as the basis for exchange-traded options.

   The CBOE, however, had recently been asserting that its
license to the indexes was broader.
   The dispute began last summer, when the underwriters
withdrew what was to have been an offering of $110 million in
five-year notes, at an interest rate linked to the
appreciation of the S&amp;P 500 index over the life of the bonds.
S&amp;P said at the time that the underwriters withdrew the
offering -- by the country of Denmark -- "apparently due to a
legal disagreement between S&amp;P and the CBOE" over whether the
Chicago exchange has the right to exclusively market any
security with a return based on movement of the indexes.
   S&amp;P and the CBOE said yesterday that they have "signed a
new agreement to extend CBOE's license to trade put and call
options" on the two stock indexes. In addition, they said
they have "agreed to terminate" the litigation that began in
November, under which S&amp;P asked the court to terminate the
1983 contract, or, alternatively, to rule that the pact
doesn't extend to financial instruments other than the
options spelled out in the original agreement.
   An S&amp;P spokeswoman said the new agreement extends CBOE's
rights to use the popular S&amp;P 500 index through 1998. As to
the exchange's perception that its license was broader than
that stated in the original pact, the "mutually satisfactory"
new agreement "did clarify" the relationship, she said. She
declined to elaborate.
