   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- In a move that could improve
Chrysler Corp's. strained labor relations, the auto maker
said it will delay until next May the closing of a St. Louis
assembly plant it had scheduled to shut in November.
   The United Auto Workers union, which is currently
bargaining with Chrysler for a new three-year contract to
cover its 60,000 members who work for Chrysler, applauded the
move. But the union said the gesture still fell short of
satisfying their demands for strong job guarantees.

   "It's a move in the right direction, but it doesn't solve
the issue of job security," said Roy Wyse, the union's top
official in the St. Louis region.
   Chrysler officials said they delayed the closing because
the company needs additional capacity at the plants that were
scheduled to take over production of the Dodge Daytona and
Chrysler LeBaron models currently assembled at the St. Louis
No. 1 plant.
   Chrysler plans to move production of Daytonas to its
Sterling Heights, Mich., plant. That plant currently builds
the Dodge Shadow and the Plymouth Sundance subcompact cars.
LeBaron production was scheduled to move to Chrysler's
Newark, Del., facility, where it builds the compact Dodge
Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim cars.
   But yesterday, Chrysler said it needed the production
capacity in the two plants to meet potential increased demand
for the Spirit and Acclaim and the Sundance and Shadow
models.
   Yesterday's decision marked the second time Chrysler has
delayed the closing of the St. Louis facility since February,
when the company announced it would close the facility this
month. In May, the auto maker extended the closing date until
November.
   Chrysler had planned to begin retooling its Sterling
Heights and Newark plants in December. But yesterday the auto
maker said those plans have been put on hold.
   The news of more work at Chrysler in St. Louis brought a
positive development to the company's talks with the United
Auto Workers, which have been tense since they got under way
in July. The union announced last week that it will set the
pattern for the next three-year contract in negotiations with
General Motors Corp. Thus, talks at Chrysler have been pushed
to the back burner.
   The union's Mr. Wyse said the extension will give the
union more time to press Chrysler to keep the plant open
permanently. Union officials said earlier the plant closing
would figure prominently in their negotiations with Chrysler
this year. They also are angry that Chrysler closed a plant
in Detroit earlier this year.
   Chrysler, whose U.S. automotive profits have been battered
by a sales and market share slump, is seeking to cut benefits
for its UAW employees. Thus far, union leaders have insisted
that Chrysler workers be compensated virtually the same as GM
and Ford workers, who are unlikely to agree to concessions.
