   LOS ANGELES -- Citing "outrageous government misconduct,"
a U.S. District Court judge dismissed mail fraud,
racketeering and other charges against independent record
promoter Joseph Isgro and two others, aborting a highly
publicized trial and a four-year-old investigation into
"payola" in the record industry.
   Mr. Isgro, who for years was retained by most of the major
record companies to promote their releases, was on trial on
charges of giving money and cocaine to radio station
employees in California and Texas in return for air play.

   Judge James M. Ideman threw the 57-count case out of court
"with prejudice," meaning that prosecutors may not retry the
case unless they can get a higher court to overturn the
judge's order. He tonguelashed the prosecutors for
"intentionally" withholding evidence because "they feared
(its) devastating effect" on their case.
   As Mr. Isgro's supporters were rejoicing, government
prosecutor William S. Lynch would say only that he found the
ruling "regrettable," and that he would recommend that the
government appeal the verdict.
   Donald M. Re, Mr. Isgro's attorney, and Gerson Horn,
representing co-defendant Jeffrey S. Monka, contended that
grand jury testimony by former tax accountant Dennis Di Ricco
was tainted by contradictory testimony given in an earlier
trial. Mr. Re and Mr. Horn said it was this testimony that
prosecutors withheld from them. Defense attorneys contended
all along that the case against Mr. Isgro hinged on witnesses
who were offered deals by the government.
   The U.S. Attorney's office apparent gaffe seemed even more
striking given the fact that the government had deployed Mr.
Lynch, a Justice Department senior litigation counsel from
Washington, D.C.
   Mr. Lynch, according to defense attorney Mr. Horn, let
slip in judge's chambers a remark indicating he was aware of
Mr. Di Ricco's testimony. Mr. Horn had finally tracked down
copies of the testimony in San Francisco. When Mr. Horn
procured it, he says he found no less than 74 instances where
the testimony of Mr. Di Ricco contradicted the later grand
jury testimony.
   Mr. Di Ricco was important to the government's case
because he told the grand jury he had participated in a drug
money-laundering scheme and delivered cash to Mr. Isgro's
bodyguard that would be used to bribe radio station
personnel.
   After Mr. Di Ricco was convicted of obstruction of justice
and tax conspiracy last year, he agreed to cooperate with
prosecutors as other drug charges were dismissed. The defense
had argued that much of the government's case was based on
testimony of witnesses who had made similar deals.
   When Judge Ideman first indicated that government
misconduct might have occurred last week, he mentioned that
it wasn't the first time the government had engaged in such
conduct in connection with the payola case. Last year,
charges against Valerie Tashjian, wife of Isgro associate
Ralph Tashjian, were dismissed because U.S. District Judge
Pamela Ann Rymer objected to the prosecutors' conduct,
accusing them of coercing the defendants.
   In opening arguments, the prosecution had indicated that
they wouldn't be going after the major record companies. But
industry observers had wondered whether Mr. Isgro, if
convicted, might have implicated record company officials.
Also on trial was one former CBS Records executive, Raymond
Anderson, accused of taking kickbacks from Mr. Isgro.
