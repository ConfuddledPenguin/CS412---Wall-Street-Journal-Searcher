   Search Exploration Inc. said it filed an amendment to its
multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Sonat Inc.'s Marshall
Exploration Inc. subsidiary to include charges under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute.
   The amended complaint, filed in state court in Dallas,
charges that Marshall and related defendants "have engaged in
a systematic pattern of mail and wire fraud for more than six
years." According to the complaint, Marshall, an oil and gas
exploration and production company, overcharged investors for
its services and issued "often misleading, deceptive and
ultimately fraudulent" assessments of wells it managed.
Search, a Dallas-based exploration and production company,
added that "this wrongful conduct extended to numerous wells
and injured tens if not hundreds of investors."

   A spokesman for Sonat, a Birmingham, Ala.-based
diversified energy company, called the Search complaint
"totally without merit."
