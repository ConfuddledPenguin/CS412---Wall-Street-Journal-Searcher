   A hangover of slow holiday trading prevailed in the
Treasury market yesterday. But even though trading was light,
higher oil prices helped government debt prices slip lower.
   "Nobody is making new decisions," said John Burrus,
president of CRT Government Securities Ltd.

   Bond traders and investors are watching developments in
the Mideast, waiting for the important August payroll report,
and trading under the influence of oil prices in the
meantime.
   Yesterday, crude oil prices for October delivery closed
$1.80 higher at $29.12 a barrel. The 30-year Treasury bond
fell nearly $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, pushing the
yield up to 9.01%.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its
index of business activity declined in August to 47% from
47.4% in July, but that was in line with expectations and
failed to move the market much.
   The debate facing Treasury bond investors and traders
concerns the timing of another interest-rate cut from the
Federal Reserve, and what the Mideast tensions might mean for
federal budget negotiations. The market is also keeping watch
for further signs of economic weakness, traders said.
   "The market is two different worlds right now," said
Donald Allison, managing director at Carroll McEntee &amp;
McGinley Inc. "Short-term securities are trading off weakness
in the domestic economy and the hope that the Federal Reserve
will ease. Long-term securities are being battered by the oil
market and pessimism about a meaningful budget compromise."
He said the dollar's recent weakness has also contributed to
declines in the bond market because it has kept foreign
investors' money home or in other markets.
   Friday's report on August employment could be an important
catalyst for a move to lower short-term rates by the Fed,
traders think. Louis vB. Crandall, economist at R.J.
Wrightson &amp; Associates, says inflation and employment are
high on the central bank's list of important economic
signals. But he says that the Fed must also ease at a time
when the dollar is stable against key currencies.
   "The fact that we are seeing some trading range for the
dollar enhances the possibility of a rate cut," Mr. Crandall
said. "The Fed would prefer not to disrupt the foreign
exchange market." A renewed plunge in the dollar would roil
the stock and bond markets, possibly making it difficult for
U.S. companies to raise capital, he added.
   Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, says the Persian Gulf conflict makes
deficit negotiations tougher. He says a tax on energy and
defense spending cuts, two important proposals for deficit
reduction, are bound to be reconsidered by Congress.
   "We had been looking for a $50 billion deficit-reduction
package for 1991," said Mr. Platt. Now, he has scaled back
his estimate to $35 billion to $40 billion.
   White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday that
despite the Gulf crisis and a possible economic downturn, the
administration still hopes to cut the budget deficit by $50
billion in fiscal 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury note and bond prices moved lower in thin, calm
trading. One dealer said many investors and traders were
still on vacation.
   The 8 1/8% two-year note closed unchanged at 100 3/32 to
yield 8.05%. The 8 3/4% 10-year note slipped 5/32 to 99 4/32
to yield 8.87%.
   The Treasury sold $18.45 billion of short-term debt
yesterday at its weekly auction. The average discount rate on
three-month bills was 7.39%, down from 7.49% at last week's
auction. The average discount rate on the six-month bill was
7.36%, down from 7.48% last week.
   The average yield on the three-month bills was the lowest
since the average of 7.23% at the auction on Aug. 6, 1990.
The yield on the six-month bills was the lowest since the
average of 7.31% at the auction on Aug. 13, 1990.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated Sept. 6, 1990. The 13-week bills

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   International bond traders were jolted when the West
German finance ministry rejected all bids for the second part
of a German Unity bond sale. The funds are being raised by
the government to help finance unification with East Germany.
   The government had sold 2.5 billion marks of the 10-year,
8.75% bonds Monday to a consortium of West German banks at a
discounted price of 99.20 to yield 8.88%. The second part of
the sale was offered yesterday in a tender auction to a
select group of banks.
   To the surprise of dealers, the West German government
said the bids offered for the bonds in the auction were too
low, and yields too high, for the finance ministry's liking.
"We would like to finance at a lower cost," one official
said.
   A finance ministry spokesman would only say that the
interest yields sought by the bidders were all "above the
market" and thus unacceptable.
   "Our suspicion is that the 8.75% bond was not in great
demand," said one U.S. dealer in London. "I believe that if
they had an urgent need to fund things they would have not
drawn back from the allocation." He said 9% is an attractive
spread for domestic buyers in Germany where the cost of money
is now at about 8%.
   The Unity Fund issue was quoted late in Frankfurt at
98.30, up 0.05 point, to yield 9.01%.
   Among other issues, Bonn's 8 3/4% issue due in 2000
slipped 0.07 point to 99.43 for a yield of 8.99%. The latest
issue, the 8 1/2% Bund, or bond, due in 2000 shed 0.01 point
to 96.80 to yield 9%.
   "International investors are still very reluctant to buy
Bunds because estimates on the cost of unification are still
so hard to find," said one dealer. "And domestic customers
are starting to think that yields around 9% are what they
should be going for."
   In London, government bonds finished higher in thin
trading. The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% of 2003/2007 was
quoted at 100 16/32, up 23/32 from late Monday, to yield
11.67%.
   The Japanese government bond market ended weaker, weighed
down by rising oil prices, the yen's erosion and continued
high costs of short-term funds. The benchmark No. 119 4.8%
coupon due in 1999 ended at 82.98, down 0.04 in price.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues

   The corporate bond market, including high-yield junk
bonds, finished unchanged to slightly lower.
   Among the noticeably weaker issues were the junk bonds of
Itel Corp. Its 13% senior subordinated notes, maturing in
1999, fell two points to 83.
   Itel's bonds have been depressed recently because of
concerns that the company's plan to repurchase common shares
will squeeze its already tight cash flow.
   Dirk Van Doren, a high-yield analyst at McCarthy Crisanti
&amp; Maffei Inc., said that the overall downturn in the
junk-bond market, combined with Itel's report last month of
weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings, have
contributed to the pressure on the bonds.
   "In the face of weakening numbers, their cash flow is
already spoken for," Mr. Van Doren said.
   Junk bonds of USG Corp. edged lower on heightened concerns
that a fragile home-building sector will threaten the
company's wallboard business. USG's 13.25% senior
subordinated debentures, due in 2000, shed one point to end
at 48.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were unchanged to 1/4 point lower in
extremely light dealings.
   "We really don't have much direction," one municipal
trader said.
   New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due in 2018
were unchanged at 98 1/2 to yield 7.31%. Florida Board of
Education's 7 1/4% issue maturing in 2023 was off 1/8 point
at 97 1/2, yielding 7.42%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The mortgage-securities market ended modestly lower.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issues
for September and October delivery were each down 7/32 at 98
11/32 and 98 6/32, respectively.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue for
September delivery was off 6/32 at 97 30/32, while the
October delivery Gold PC 9 1/2% issue was down 6/32 at 98
17/32. Federal National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issues
for September and October delivery were each 6/32 lower at 98
15/32 and 98 9/32, respectively.
   Other actively traded secondary issues showed declines of
as much as 1/4 point.
