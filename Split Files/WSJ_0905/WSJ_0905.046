   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Portec Inc. said a federal appeals
court in Denver reduced a judgment in a lawsuit against it to
$1.2 million from $2.2 million.
   Portec, which makes engineered products for various
industries, including railroads, said the judgment resulted
from a jury trial in 1988, in a suit by the British Post
Office. Portec said the suit claimed that certain of its
manufacturing operations weren't properly licensed.

   Portec said that if the British Post Office refuses the
judgment reduction, the case would have to be retried.
