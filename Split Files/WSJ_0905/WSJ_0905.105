   The world's appetite for petroleum seems to be rising on
fears of a Middle East war, despite already sharply higher
prices and sluggish economies.
   People and companies concerned about potential shortages
are suddenly "topping off" their tanks, oil economists say.
That is putting more upward pressure on prices, the
economists add. Also, if there are going to be any oil
shortages from the Middle East crisis, such buying could
trigger them prematurely.

   Consumers aren't using more oil, just purchasing it now
and storing it instead of buying it later when they normally
would need it. Such demand is "borrowed" from future months
and simply moves fuel out of primary commercial inventories
and into so-called secondary and tertiary storage. Many
European apartment dwellers are filling their fuel oil tanks
in these final days of summer, for example, rather than
waiting for winter to approach.
   "Nothing is really changing, except whose tank holds the
oil," said Paul Mlotok, an oil economist with Morgan Stanley
Group. However, "an acceleration of demands on commercial
inventories could cause an apparent tightening of supplies
and a rise in price faster than would occur otherwise," he
says.
   Fuel and crude oil prices, paced by gasoline, surged again
yesterday. In U.S. futures trading, unleaded gasoline for
October delivery jumped 8.34 cents a gallon to settle at
94.52 cents. Heating oil rose 5.83 cents a gallon to 82.39
cents. October crude oil, similar to West Texas Intermediate,
increased $1.80 a barrel to settle at $29.12. Also, several
refiners raised their field postings for the benchmark WTI
crude by $1.75 to $27.50.
   The trend in demand is similar to one that developed
during the 1979 Iranian revolution. Large volumes of oil were
closed down then, similar in size to the 4.3 million barrels
a day that Iraq and Kuwait exported before global sanctions
were imposed. In 1979, oil demand was artificially stimulated
by precautionary inventory building -- some called it
hoarding -- and surged to nearly 52 million barrels a day as
prices doubled.
   Petroleum demand only recently has again reached the 1979
level. Many estimates for current demand range from 52
million to 53 million barrels a day.
   Demand normally begins to rise at this time of year,
hitting its annual peak during the fourth and first quarters.
But there is evidence that demand is suddenly spurting well
ahead of this time a year ago. In the four weeks through Aug.
24, U.S. petroleum demand is estimated to have averaged 18.2
million barrels a day, up nearly 6% from the year-earlier
period.
   Many oil forecasters are drawing up new demand projections
for the third quarter -- even though it is two-thirds over.
These replace some predictions made only a month ago to take
into account the unexpected surge.
   The International Energy Agency will report this week that
its new estimate for third-quarter demand has been revised
upward by 500,000 barrels a day from its forecast of 52.6
million barrels a day made a month ago. On the other hand,
the Paris agency will revise its estimated demand for the
fourth quarter downward by 800,000 barrels a day from the
month-earlier forecast of 55.3 million barrels a day.
   "There has been movement of demand forward from the fourth
quarter to the third," said an IEA official.
   Withdrawals from commercial inventories and higher
production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are expected to provide adequate supplies through
October. The IEA's new figures would suggest that chances of
any real tightening of supplies should ease later in the year
because of the anticipated slackening of fourth-quarter
demand.
   Nonetheless, IEA officials are concerned that supplies
could become tight during the winter months. At that time,
inventories will be drawn down and demand will be at its
seasonal highest. Inventories "don't have infinite staying
power," said an IEA official. One potential offset to that
scenario is an actual weakening of consumption brought on by
what would then be months of high petroleum prices.
   For next year's first and second quarters, the IEA will
report new demand estimates of 54.3 million and 51.4 million
barrels a day, respectively. These are down 1.2 million and
one million barrels a day, respectively, from the IEA
forecasts made a month ago.
