   Allergan Inc. said the U.S. District Court for northern
Texas upheld its patent for the use of its Ultrazyme
proteolytic enzyme product with hydrogen peroxide to clean
and disinfect contact lenses.
   The lawsuit, filed by Alcon Laboratories Inc. of Ft.
Worth, Texas, had sought to invalidate the patent, and
alleged that Allergan had violated antitrust laws. The court
ruled that Alcon had failed to prove those claims. Allergan
said the court's decision will allow the company to
exclusively market Ultrazyme for use with hydrogen peroxide
in the U.S. through May 2005.

   Separately, the Irvine, Calif., eye-care products maker
also announced a plan to buy back as many as 1.2 million of
the company's 67.6 million common shares through two stock
repurchase programs. One program consists of purchases of its
stock made periodically in the open market, through Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co.
   The second, to be established later, will involve the
purchase of common stock held by stockholders who own less
than 100 shares each. The stock buy-backs will be available
for use under the company's employee benefits program.
