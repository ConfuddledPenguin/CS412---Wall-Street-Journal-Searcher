   BRUSSELS -- Jessi, the much-heralded European program
intended to bolster the continent's lagging semiconductor
industry, has started to fall victim to the shakeout hitting
Europe's electronics industry.
   Participants in Jessi, an acronym for Joint European
Submicron Silicon Project, are considering whether to expel
the British computer maker International Computers Ltd.
because of the company's acquisition by Fujitsu Ltd. of
Japan.

   Meanwhile, N.V. Philips, the troubled Dutch electronics
giant, confirmed yesterday that it would pull out of a key
Jessi program involving research in advanced memory chips.
Philips said it would stop developing one-megabit static
random access memories, or SRAMs. That and its decision to
reduce participation in Jessi are among the first concrete
steps under a cost-cutting program announced by Philips in
July that involves elimination of 10,000 jobs and
restructuring costs of 2.7 billion guilders ($1.51 billion).
The company expects a loss of two billion guilders for 1990.
   Officials were adamant that the Philips pullout doesn't
signal the death of Jessi. "The withdrawal of one of the
major players in one of the larger (Jessi) projects is a
cause of concern," said an official at Eureka, the agency
overseeing Jessi and other research and development programs
in 18 West European countries and Turkey. The memory-chip
project accounts for one-fifth of total Jessi spending.
   Siemens AG and SGS Thomson, Philips' partners in the
memory-chip project, said they will continue joint research
despite Philips's decision, Jessi officials said. But
Philips's decision strikes at the very heart of Jessi,
because the entire Jessi program started in 1989 as a result
of joint efforts by Philips and Siemens to develop advanced
semiconductors.
   Philips played down its move by pointing out that its
involvement in the memory chip program accounted for only 7%
of total spending planned by all Jessi participants. It
accounted for about a third of the one billion guilders that
Philips expected to plow into Jessi research, company
officials said.
   The Dutch company said it remains involved in many other
Jessi projects, including logic semiconductors,
chip-manufacturing technology, chip materials, computer-aided
design and chips to be used for high-definition television.
   Meanwhile, Jessi's board met yesterday to consider the
implications of Fujitsu buying control of International
Computers on the British company's participation in several
Jessi projects on computer-aided design. The $4 billion Jessi
program wasn't created "to support Japanese companies," said
Jessi program coordinator Michael Gruenewald in Munich. "We
probably will have to come up with a decision (on whether to
expel International Computers) in the very near future," he
said.
   Jessi's board, which represents the companies involved in
the program, hasn't made a final decision. But it agreed to
study "the political issue and strategic issue" connected
with International Computers, said Jessi Office Manager Hans
Meyer.
   International Computers' officials expressed surprise that
Jessi was considering ending the company's participation in
Jessi. Company officials said that a lower Jessi committee
agreed last week to recommend to the board continued
International Computers participation.
   Fujitsu's agreement in July to acquire an 80% stake in
International Computers from STC PLC has fueled question at
other European R&amp;D programs. International Computers is also
a major participant in Esprit, a $1.6 billion program of the
European Community to finance research in information
technology. Mario Pandolfi, the EC Commissioner in charge of
technology and research, has said that it's up to the
companies participating in Esprit to decide whether they want
to continue working with International Computers or not.
