   WASHINGTON -- The manufacturing economy deteriorated for
the second consecutive month, according to the National
Association of Purchasing Managers.
   The group's index, which charts orders, production,
employment and other indicators of manufacturing health, fell
to 47% in August, below July's index and its lowest since
January. The association says that when the index drops below
50% it generally indicates that the manufacturing economy is
contracting.

   The group surveys purchasing executives in only about 300
companies around the country, but many economists and,
especially the financial markets, watch their index closely
because it is usually the first published report of economic
activity for any month.
   Analysts are particularly hungry for data on the economy's
performance in August, since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait
sent oil prices soaring and cast new uncertainty on the
nation's economic outlook.
   Manufacturing has been anemic for months. The Federal
Reserve's efforts to fight inflation by maintaining high
interest rates has hurt makers of automobiles and other types
of large, costly machinery and appliances that often are
purchased by borrowing.
   The purchasing managers' index, however, had recently
indicated that manufacturing was picking up from its slump,
by registering above 50% for three consecutive months in the
second quarter. But in July it slipped beneath that
threshold, to 47.4%.
   According to the survey responses, production declined for
the first time since January. New orders were down for the
second straight month, and manufacturing employment declined
for the 18th consecutive month -- at the fastest rate since
January.
   Export orders, however, continued to grow, the report
said, though at the slowest pace since February.
   In a separate economic report yesterday, the Commerce
Department said that construction spending in July increased
0.4%, the first rise in four months. Spending on private
construction grew 0.6%, but the gain was entirely in spending
on business and other nonresidential construction, which
jumped 2.5%. Private residential construction slipped 0.4%.
   Overall construction spending amounted to a $442.20
billion annual rate in July, the department said.
   The numbers in both the purchasing managers and Commerce
Department reports were adjusted for normal seasonal
fluctuations.
                                                                                                       

   Here are the Commerce Department's figures for
construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally
adjusted annual rates.
