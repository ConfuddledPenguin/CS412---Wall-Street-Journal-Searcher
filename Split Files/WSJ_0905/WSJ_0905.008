   When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, the U.S. government
halted trade with Iraq and sent out troops. Ten thousand
Westerners in the Middle East discovered they were hostages.
Americans began bracing for a recession -- or war.
   And Jeff Gonzer and Mike Coleman started writing songs.

   Mr. Gonzer, the host of the morning show at Boston radio
station WZLX, thought he might try his hand at parody. He
jotted down some lyrics. He showed them to the station's head
of production, Mike Coleman, who wrote some more and set them
to some familiar music. A few days later a new song -- to the
tune of Paul Simon's "Me and Julio Down by the School Yard"
made its debut:
                                                                                                       

   Well we're on the way
   American troops are coming
   We're on the way
   Not takin' our time so goodbye Saddam
   King of Baloney, we'll clean your corona
   Seein' me &amp; Hussein down by the oilfield
                                                                                                       

   Listeners in Boston have also been treated to such
standards as "Please Mr. Postman" -- as the Marvelettes
probably never envisioned it:
                                                                                                       

   Oh yes wait a minute Mr. Hussein
   Kuwaaiit isn't yours Mr. Hussein&amp;
                                                                                                       

   Messrs. Gonzer and Coleman are part of a time-honored
tradition. For as long as wars have threatened nations,
people have longed to, well, lighten up a little. The
Gonzer-and-Coleman idea hasn't yet reached the mighty status
of a "trend." But Iraq parody is definitely catching on. The
folks at Dallas's Magic 102.9 FM, a soft-rock station, are
treating listeners to "Hussein Is Crazy," an opus based on
last year's Fine Young Cannibals hit, "She Drives Me Crazy":
                                                                                                       

   Hussein is crazy, ooh, ooh
   He's making news, ooh, ooh
   Hussein is crazy, ooh, ooh
   Worse than the 2 Live Crew, ooh, ooh
   It would be nice to get Hussein
   Wait 'til the time he meets his fate
   Cause Noriega's getting lonely
   He could use a new cellmate
                                                                                                       

   To be sure, America's radio stations aren't
underestimating the gravity of the situation. New York's
top-40 Z100 FM has played the national anthem at 9 every
morning since the invasion. "Coach" Mike Opelka, Z-100's
producer, says this is the station's "salute to the men and
women serving in the Middle East as well as for their
families back home in the States." Even the patriotic Coach,
though, is indulging in a bit of humor. His parody,
"Iraqity-Raq," is based on "Yakety Yak" by The Coasters:
                                                                                                       

   He's got his tanks and guns and planes
   And he is totally insane
   And his name is Saddam Hussein
   Invading countries is his game.
   Iraqity Raq, don't shoot back.
                                                                                                       

   Listeners, for their part, have called the stations from
all over the world -- including the Middle East -- with
requests for tapes of the parodies. Americans are the kind of
folk who appreciate this type of thing, says Peter Zipfel --
known to fans as "Zip" -- in Phoenix. He and Drew Lane do the
morning show on Mix 101 FM there, featuring their version of
"Horse With No Name" by America:
                                                                                                       

   Now we're sittin' in the desert cursin' Saddam Hussein
   He got too much sun, fried his brain
   In the desert, you know you could go insane,
   When you use mustard gas and your name is Hussein
   Allah, la, la la la . . .
                                                                                                       

   Songs may do fine for now, but fertile DJ-brains all over
America are already expanding their war effort. WZLX, the
Boston station, has already sponsored "Iraqnophobia Day,"
distributing gasoline to listeners for $1 a gallon. Magic
102.9 in Dallas constructed a Texas-sized greeting card.
Citizens spent one enthusiastic Saturday afternoon at the
local mall signing it. "We're thinking about the guys, but at
the same time we're having fun," said Garry D, of the
station's late-night show. As he spoke, the three-piece card,
filled with signatures and messages for the troops, was
already winging its way to our men and women in Saudi Arabia.
