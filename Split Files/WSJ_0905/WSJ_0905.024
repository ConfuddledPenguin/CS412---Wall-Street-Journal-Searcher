   Sonia A. Boyar's Aug. 21 letter to the editor dismisses
the national honor of the Ukraine on the basis of the welcome
given to the invading German army of World War II. Such
dismissal ignores the most critical component of Ukrainian
nationalism, namely the view that the Ukraine was a nation
occupied by Russian imperialism. It is worth remembering
that, prior to Operation Barbarossa, the Russians had
subjected the Ukrainians to severe repression during the
agrarian uprisings, at an estimated cost of more than three
million lives.
   With this history, even a Nazi convoy could be mistaken
for a troop of white knights, under the presumption that the
Ukrainians were being liberated from their Soviet captors.
When this proved to be a false hope, the Ukrainian partisans
put up a heroic fight to expel the Germans.

   As evidence of Ukrainian fickleness, Ms. Boyar relies on a
single reference to how some Ukrainians acted under the
pressures of concentration-camp life. As one who has never
been subjected to those horrors, I would not judge the
morality practiced by those victims -- and neither should Ms.
Boyar. After all, even the Jewish camps had their kapos.
