   Now, just as the key administration and congressional
budget negotiators are heading for seclusion to shape a final
deficit-reduction package, political forces are gathering on
Capitol Hill to jettison deficit reduction completely. The
advocates of abandoning deficit reduction argue that the
slowdown of economic activity that has already occurred and
the risk of even greater weakness in the future make it
inappropriate to reduce overall demand further by cutting
government spending and raising taxes. I believe that
argument is incorrect.
   The economic slowdown doesn't mean we should abandon
deficit reduction, but we should alter the pace of its
introduction. A reliable multiyear program of deficit
reduction is now more important than ever.

   The economic argument against deficit reduction in a slow
economy is only an excuse for some members of Congress. There
are Democrats who don't want a budget deal because they think
that President Bush has not endorsed a tax increase publicly
enough and loudly enough. There are Republicans who are so
opposed to any tax increase under any circumstances -- for
either political or economic reasons -- that they welcome the
chance to scuttle the whole deficit-reduction process. And
some members of Congress simply don't want to vote for either
higher taxes or reduced benefits in an election year.
   But the economic argument against deficit reduction in the
current economic circumstances is a serious one that deserves
a response. The key fact is that achieving substantial
deficit reduction would raise economic growth over the next
three years and beyond and is compatible with continued
expansion in the nearer term. Even with our relatively weak
economy, Congress should therefore enact a package of $50
billion of deficit reductions for fiscal 1991 and $500
billion of deficit reductions over the next five years.
   It is true that the pace of economic growth has slowed
over the past 12 months, but we still have an unemployment
rate below 5.5% and a capacity utilization rate of more than
83%. Both of these measures reflect relatively tight labor
and product markets. Unemployment is lower now than it was
for any year from 1974 to 1987. And capacity utilization has
been as high as it is today in only six of the past 20 years.
The recent slow rate of expansion reflects the Federal
Reserve's policy of limiting demand to bring down the rate of
inflation. The roughly 1.5% rate of increase during the past
six months has been in line with the Fed's implicit goal for
the current year.
   The rise in the price of oil will reduce growth during the
coming year but is not likely to push the economy into
recession. The current oil price hike is much smaller than
the increases of the 1970s, and the economy starts from a
much more modest overall rate of inflation. Unlike the 1970s,
the Fed is not tightening credit in response to the current
rise in oil prices. If the Fed sticks to its goal of keeping
overall nominal gross national product rising at about 6%
over the coming year, the oil price rise is likely to mean
only about a 0.5% decline in next year's growth and a
temporary 0.5% rise in the price level. Real GNP and
employment should continue to expand.
   The current expansion is, however, a lopsided one in which
output and employment in construction and in many
manufacturing industries are stagnant or declining. These
interest-sensitive industries are the ones that would be
particularly helped by the fall in interest rates that would
follow a substantial reduction in the budget deficit.
   The simplistic Keynesian analysis that argues against
deficit reduction ignores the favorable effect of deficit
reduction on interest rates and interest-sensitive spending.
Instead it reckons that a package of spending cuts and taxes
aimed at slicing $50 billion from the 1991 deficit would
simply cut real GNP by nearly as much, dragging real growth
to zero or even into a slight decline.
   But the Keynesian direct impact on GNP of higher taxes and
reduced government outlays is only part of the story. A cut
in current and future budget deficits would mean lower
interest rates and therefore more spending on construction,
business investment and other interest-sensitive goods. Even
without help from the Fed, medium-term and long-term interest
rates would fall as financial-market participants recognize
that less government borrowing means a reduced demand for
funds both now and in the future. And Alan Greenspan signaled
in testimony earlier this summer that the Fed would actively
assist that decline in rates by increasing the money supply
more rapidly and cutting the short-term money market rates.
   The increase in spending on interest-sensitive goods and
on construction would not only help those industries but, for
the economy as a whole, could fully offset or even more than
offset the contractionary effects of the other spending cuts
that result from higher taxes and reduced government outlays.
Lower interest rates would also help to make the dollar more
competitive, giving a boost to our exports and making
domestic products more competitive with imports. If interest
rates drop far enough in response to the budget package,
total demand and real GNP could be higher in 1991 than they
would have been without a cut in the deficit.
   The size of the interest-rate decline will reflect the
market's expectations of the magnitude of deficit reduction
over the next several years. The bigger the cumulative
reduction in the deficit is expected to be, the greater will
be the fall in interest rates. It's important therefore to
enact a deficit package that specifies credible deficit
reductions over the five-year budget horizon.
   The best way to make those out-year deficit reductions
credible to a financial market that has become skeptical
after years of phony budget projections is to have a
first-year deficit reduction that is both substantial and
real. Scaling back the 1991 reduction from $50 billion and
using accounting gimmicks and temporary changes to meet the
target would reduce the credibility of the entire package.
But a $50 billion deficit reduction for 1991 and an
explicitly articulated set of deficit reductions for the
following four years could bring interest rates down sharply.
   Timing is important in the pacing of the first year of the
deficit-reduction package. Experience shows that lower
interest rates and a lower dollar expand demand only after a
delay of about six months. It takes that long for the fall in
interest rates to be translated into new housing starts,
increased production of investment goods and increased orders
for exports. In contrast, reductions in government spending
and hikes in taxes on households drain demand from the
economy immediately.
   It would be best therefore if the magnitude of the deficit
reduction increased during the year, starting at less than a
$50 billion annual rate in the first few months and rising to
more than a $50 billion annual rate by the end of the fiscal
year. That should be easy enough to engineer by legislating
that the excise-tax increases and some of the other changes
begin part-way through the fiscal year.
   Although the economic debate about cutting the deficit now
may focus on the impact on overall demand and economic
activity during the coming year, the real reason for deficit
reduction is its favorable effect over the years ahead.
Shrinking the budget deficit by $500 billion over the next
five years will give us a balanced budget by mid-decade and
will add more than a trillion dollars to the nation's capital
stock by the end of the decade. That means a stronger economy
and a higher standard of living.
   A political decision to postpone deficit reduction for yet
another year would run the risk that the financial-market
participants will give up hope of ever seeing a fall in
government borrowing. They may well conclude that if
President Bush's willingness to cut defense outlays and raise
taxes is not enough to get a budget deal, nothing ever will
be. If the hope of deficit reduction is lost, the result
could be a sharp rise in long-term interest rates and a
collapse of interest-sensitive spending and of exports.
Abandoning the process of deficit reduction at this time thus
runs the serious risk of pushing the economy into a recession
induced by higher interest rates.
   It would, of course, have been better to start cutting the
deficit several years ago when the economy was growing much
more rapidly. The increase in capital formation and the
reduction in interest rates that would have followed an
earlier deficit reduction would have given us higher
productivity and a stronger economy today. But we cannot turn
back the clock. We can only hope that common sense will
prevail before time runs out.
