   Regarding your comment on Actors' Equity's initial
decision to bar Jonathan Pryce from playing the role of a
Eurasian in "Miss Saigon" because it would be an affront to
the Asian community ("Banned on Broadway" editorial, Aug. 9),
I cannot help but think that somebody has gotten something
mixed up. A Eurasian is a person of both European and Asian
ancestry. Hence, if it is wrong for Mr. Pryce, a European, to
play the role, it is equally wrong for an Asian actor to do
so.
   By Actors' Equity's definition, the role should have been
open only to someone of mixed European and Asian ancestry.
