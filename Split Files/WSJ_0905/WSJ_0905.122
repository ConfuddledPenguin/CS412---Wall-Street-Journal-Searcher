   Millicom Inc., New York, said its subsidiary, Millicom
Technologies Corp., formed a joint venture with SCS Mobilecom
Inc., Port Washington, N.Y., to develop a design to test its
personal communications network.
   Millicom, an international telecommunications company, has
been working on developing PCNs -- the latest generation of
wallet-sized wireless telephones -- to compete with existing
cellular technology.

   In May, the Federal Communications Commission granted
Millicom a license to test PCNs in Texas and Florida. But in
order to proceed, Millicom needs a frequency to test the
network on, as well as handsets that can incorporate the new
technology.
   In teaming up with SCS Mobilecom, Millicom gains access to
SCS's expertise in spread spectrum technology, a signaling
technique that allows a radio communication system to operate
over several frequencies without interfering with other
signals. Millicom says it is talking with various
manufacturers but has yet to select one to produce the
handsets.
