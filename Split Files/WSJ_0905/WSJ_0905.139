after falling at a 2.2% rate in the first period, the Labor
Department reported.
   The increase in productivity -- output per hour of work --
stemmed from a rise in production at a 1.6% annual rate while

   The report covers all corporations doing business in the
U.S. except banks, stock and commodity brokers, and finance
and insurance agencies.
   In addition to the new figures for nonfinancial
corporations, the government also issued revised productivity
statistics for other categories. Productivity of all U.S.
businesses increased during the second quarter at an annual
rate of 1.7%, compared with an original estimate of 1.9% and
a first-quarter decline at a 1.5% annual rate.
   The increase in productivity among nonfarm businesses was
revised to a 1.5% annual rate from 1.6%. Nonfarm productivity
also rose at a 1.6% annual rate in the first quarter.
Manufacturing productivity rose at a revised rate of 4%, up
from the earlier estimate of 3.7% but down from the first
quarter's 5.1% pace.
   The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.
