   On Aug. 10, your page-one Washington Wire column reported
that the Washington Institute for Near East Policy had
predicted that the 1990s oil market would be characterized by
"stable or decreasing prices."
   I hope that this Washington Institute for Near East Policy
has no influence on Washington's Near East Policy.
