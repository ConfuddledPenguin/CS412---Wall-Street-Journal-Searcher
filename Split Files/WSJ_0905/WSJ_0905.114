   Quayle Has 'Em Laughing
   All the Way to the Bank

   VICE PRESIDENT Dan Quayle may be doing more for small
businesses and the economy than most people think.
   Entrepreneurs selling everything from wristwatches to
calendars that poke fun at Mr. Quayle say interest is still
strong nearly two years after the election. "I saw the
writing on the wall when he was elected," says John Wade, a
conservative Republican and T-shirt merchant in Lenexa, Kan.
His top seller: a T-shirt with the logo, "President's Prayer
Club -- Keep George Healthy."
   In Arlington, Va., entrepreneur Walton Sullivan gets about
40 orders a week for another hot T-shirt: It shows a ghoulish
black and white screaming face taken from Edvard Munch's "The
Scream," along with the words, "President Quayle."
   In Chicago, Computronics Discount Radar Detectors' $29.50
Dan Quayle watches boost profits. Mr. Quayle's tie makes up
the hour and minute hands amid misplaced watch-face numbers.
   Another popular item: a $9 record by the Capital Steps, a
political-satire group in Washington. One ditty, sung to the
tune of "Has Anybody Seen My Gal," goes: "Five-foot-10, hair
like Ken, looks like TV weathermen. . . Teeth of white, very
bright, twice as smart as Vanna White. . ."
   Quayle-bashers haven't had much material to work with
recently -- and some fear sales may peter out. "He's been on
a very short leash lately. . . . He stays with the prepared
text," says Deborah Werksman, co-founder of the Quayle
Quarterly, a $12-a-year periodical of humorously biting
articles, letters and cartoons on the vice president and his
wife.
   As for Mr. Quayle, a spokesman notes: "The vice president
admires entrepreneurship in all forms."
                                                                                                       

   Franchisers' Mergers
   Creating More Strains
                                                                                                       

   RISING MERGER activity will probably add to tensions
between franchisers and their franchisees.
   People in the industry say mergers among franchisers are
rising. In the past 18 months, for instance, Ponderosa merged
with rival steakhouse chain Bonanza, Mr. Donut and Dunkin'
Donuts joined forces, and Popeye's acquired competing
fried-chicken purveyor Church's.
   The mergers result in part from intensifying competition
that is driving weak firms into the hands of stronger
partners. "There are so many companies out there that are
technically very sound but don't know how to sell franchises
or build the business," says Don Dwire of Dwire Group, a
Waco, Texas, franchise holding company.
   For franchisees, relations with new owners can be severely
strained. Sometimes franchisees end up disfranchised when a
new owner converts old franchisees to a new system. Hardee's
Foods Systems failed to convert all 650 Burger Chef
franchises when it acquired that chain.
   A Hardee's spokesman says, "There was some falling out,
but it was minimal." Hardee's is now converting the 640-unit
Roy Rogers chain it bought this year.
   New owners also can alter a franchiser's strategy. Erik
Wulff, a Chicago franchising lawyer, says Pillsbury angered
Haagen Dazs store franchisees after it bought the franchiser
by emphasizing sales of the ice cream in grocery stores. But
relations have improved, the company says.
                                                                                                       

   Small Factories Aren't
   Big on Modernization
                                                                                                       

   THE SMALLER the factory, the less likely the owner will
invest anytime soon in automation, finds a recent survey of
more than 600 metal-fabricating firms. Executives at only a
fifth of fabricators with sales under $5 million said they
invested in factory automation in the past five years, and
only 17% intend to do so in the next three years.
   In contrast, more than half of those from companies with
sales exceeding $20 million have invested in factory
automation. And half say they plan to begin or continue
modernizing.
   The survey -- commissioned by McGladrey &amp; Pullen,
Minneapolis-based accountants, and the Fabricators and
Manufacturers Association -- indicates the smallest
fabricators have done far less to take advantage of many new
technologies, such as bar coding, sales forecasting,
just-in-time inventory techniques, statistical controls,
computer-integrated manufacturing, and lasers.
   Though respondents weren't asked why they balk at new
technology, interviews with small-factory owners suggest they
often consider it too costly. They compete by being creative
with machinery they already have.
   Bill Meyer, part-owner of a precision sheet-metal
fabricator in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., avoided spending as much
as $100,000 for a large milling machine by stretching the
limits of his small one. He is using his machine to make
robot tables for a customer by working on each table in
sections, rather than all at once, as a large machine would.
The tables support assembly-line robots.
   H. Blaine Fluth, president of a small metal-tube shaping
concern in Minneapolis, says he used his machines to
successfully develop new products in ways considered
impossible by the salesmen who sold him the machines.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   FRANCHISEES of Canadian Tire shops in British Columbia
provide a novel incentive to keep people in boring jobs
longer: They pay up to $3,000 to send employees through
college while they work. Employees quit their jobs upon
graduation. . . . People are the top cause of productivity
problems for small manufacturers, says a recent survey by
Grant Thornton. Over half -- 56% -- blamed people for
productivity snafus; 27%, technology, and 16%, plant and
equipment.
