   TULSA, Okla. -- Kinark Corp. said its previously announced
accord to sell its Camelot Hotels to Wilmae Inc. for $12
million was terminated.
   Paul Chastain, Kinark's co-chief executive officer, said
closely held Wilmae, of Santa Rosa, Calif., "had delays in
obtaining financing" and failed to make a required $50,000
deposit. He added that Wilmae will forfeit an earlier $50,000
deposit.

facilities, said it plans to continue efforts to sell the
hotels.
