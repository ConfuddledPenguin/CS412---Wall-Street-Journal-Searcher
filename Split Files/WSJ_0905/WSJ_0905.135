   Hewlett-Packard Co., of Palo Alto, Calif., said it reduced
U.S. list prices on its top-of-the-line HP Vectra personal
computers by as much as 24%, a move analysts said may be
designed to combat slow sales.
   The reductions, which became effective Saturday, range
from $300 to $4,600. The price of the HP Vectra 486 Model
670, for example, was lowered to $14,899 from $19,499. Also
reduced up to 36% were Hewlett-Packard's 330-megabyte and
670-megabyte, enhanced small-device interface, or ESDI, disk
drives.

   Pradeep Jotwani, the company's North American PC marketing
manager, said the price declines were driven by lower
manufacturing costs for ESDI hard-disk drives and by lower
costs for components.
   Timothy R. McCollum, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York, said the main factor behind the price
decreases was that Hewlett-Packard had trouble selling the HP
Vectra line since the top models were introduced in January
1989.
