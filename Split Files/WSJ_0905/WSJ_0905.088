   DWG Corp., which has been ruled by Victor Posner, the
iron-fisted Miami Beach financier, agreed to yield some
control of the company by adding three independent directors
to its 13-member board, in a settlement with Granada
Investments Inc.
   DWG owns such enterprises as Arby's Inc. and Royal Crown
Cos. and is the crown jewel of the 72-year-old corporate
raider's shrinking empire.

   Granada, a New York-based investment firm, sued DWG's
board in April 1989, charging, among other things, that DWG's
directors shirked their fiduciary responsibility by not
seriously considering a $22-a-share, or $572 million, offer
that Granada had made for DWG in March 1989. The suit also
attacked the high salary and other perquisites of DWG
Chairman Victor Posner.
   DWG, in a countersuit, claimed that Granada's bid was
never a serious offer, but rather a scheme intended to
manipulate the market for DWG shares and allow Granada to
benefit from the increase in the stock's price when the
company was in play.
   The settlement -- which covers DWG, Granada, and certain
third-party defendants, including Granada's chairman, New
York attorney Andrew N. Heine -- is subject to approval by
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas D. Lambros, who has presided
over the court battle in Cleveland. DWG is incorporated in
Ohio.
   Leonard A. Pelullo, a Miami Beach hotelier who was a
member of the Granada group but withdrew, isn't a party to
the settlement.
   According to Martin Rosen, an attorney for DWG, the
settlement calls for the judge to pick three candidates who
will be added to DWG's slate of directors. As usual, the
directors will be voted on by shareholders.
   The settlement also provides for the independent directors
to be named to DWG's key committees, including its
compensation committee, which ponders issues like Mr.
Posner's controversial and hefty pay; the
intercorporate-transactions committee, which controls
business dealings within the Posner empire; and the audit
committee. One of the independent directors will become
chairman of the audit committee, Mr. Rosen said.
   Of the three independent directors, two will succeed
Martin Posner, who is a nephew of Mr. Posner, and Brenda
Castellano. The third will fill a vacancy on the board.
   Terms of the pact also call for the judge to determine how
much DWG should reimburse Granada for fees and expenses
associated with the litigation, up to a maximum of $5.5
million. "It's been a long, hard and bitter fight," said Mr.
Rosen, who called the agreement to foot the bill for
Granada's costs "a common thing."
   Neither Mr. Heine nor other Granada officials could be
reached for comment.
