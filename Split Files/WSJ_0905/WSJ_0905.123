   WASHINGTON -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. won a $140 million
contract to build 40 F/A-18 Hornet jet aircraft for the
government of Kuwait, the Defense Department said.
   The contract covers equipment purchases that were worked
out several years ago under the foreign military sales
program, the Pentagon said. But the agreement was just
recently signed with Kuwait's exiled government, which fled
the country after the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraq.

   The sale is proceeding because "the government of Kuwait
still exists," and the U.S. hopes the exiled government will
regain its territory from Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman said.
   The F/A-18 performs both fighter and attack roles. The
contract, which is to be completed in September 1993,
involves two versions of the aircraft, 32 F/A-18Cs and eight
F/A-18Ds.
   A separate contract, also being awarded to McDonnell
Douglas, covers a $5.4 million order for technical
publications for the Kuwaiti F/A-18s.
                                                                                                       

   In other Pentagon awards, Vitro Services Corp. got a $34.5
million Army contract for operation of the development test
center range.
                                                                                                       

   Charles Stark Draper Laboratories Inc. won a $29.5 million
Air Force contract for missile technical support.
                                                                                                       

   Boeing Co. received an $18.3 million Air Force contract
for radio sets.
                                                                                                       

   Ocean Line of Azores Inc. was issued a $13.1 million Navy
contract for cargo transport.
