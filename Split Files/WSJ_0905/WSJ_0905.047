   ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Around the corner and down the street
from Maxine Clark's row house in this poor section of town,
three teen-agers are hanging out on a sunny afternoon. Two
prepare for the Labor Day weekend by fixing their bicycle
tires. The third is otherwise engaged. He has two cellular
telephones, the favorite tool of the drug trade, one in each
hand.
   Just another day in a rough neighborhood, except that this
is a neighborhood with a difference. Black community leaders
here worked three years to get an anti-loitering law to help
the police nab drug dealers. Ms. Clark, a public-school
teacher and head of an area civic group, hopes the law will
help close down several open-air drug markets. She says one
of these is in the parking lot of the local McDonald's, whose
Help Wanted signs are ignored as neighborhood youths count
their profits as foot soldiers in the drug trade.

   The law, passed in April, hasn't been tested yet. It must
first withstand the obligatory legal challenge by the
American Civil Liberties Union -- which still supports drug
legalization -- joined by the local branch of the NAACP.
Alexandria will defend the constitutionality of its law in
federal court on Friday.
   Virginia law requires that the police actually see drugs
before making an arrest, which is why drugs are passed in
envelopes, often by couriers. Police say an anti-loitering
law would be easier to enforce.
   The ordinance on Loitering for Purposes of Engaging in an
Unlawful Drug Transaction details seven rather convoluted
factors that must be present before a policeman can justify
an arrest: The person must be in the same general location (a
750-foot radius) for 15 minutes, during which time and in a
public place he has two or more face-to-face contacts with
others, contacts that last no more than two minutes, involves
actions or movements "consistent with an exchange or money or
other small objects" where there is an "effort to conceal" an
object appearing to have been exchanged and where the contact
terminates shortly after the completion of the apparent
exchange.
   The reason the statute is drawn so narrowly -- will police
officers have to carry stopwatches to mark two minutes? -- is
that the Supreme Court breezily struck down earlier
anti-loitering laws as overly vague and subject to abuse. In
a 1972 case, Justice William Douglas praised "loafers or
loiterers" and cited Vachel Lindsay's poem "I Want to Go
Wandering." Justice Douglas said the "implicit presumption in
these generalized vagrancy standards -- that crime is being
nipped in the bud -- is too extravagant to deserve extended
treatment." This assertion didn't faze drug dealers who were
not out for a stroll when they made street dealing
commonplace after anti-loitering laws disappeared.
   The one good reason to invalidate these laws was that as
late as the 1960s, some police forces did use anti-loitering
laws selectively, as a way to harass blacks. The ACLU suit,
however, does not explain why many black leaders support this
law. The group's main claim is that innocent activities would
come under the law.
   One example the ACLU gives is that lawyers would violate
the law if they "have business cards which they give to
persons whom they may meet on the street." Aside from the
rarity of lawyers so modest that they act furtively when they
hand out their cards, this objection ignores the law's
specific intent requirement. The seven factors are necessary
conditions to an arrest, but not the only conditions. The law
tells the police to get an explanation of suspicious behavior
before making an arrest. There won't be any convictions on
loitering for drug sales if the only contraband is a business
card.
   "A person who stands around for prolonged periods in a
public space and has frequent and fleeting encounters with
different individuals with whom he exchanges small objects in
a furtive and surreptitious manner is likely engaged," the
city's lawyers say, "either in drug trafficking or in an
effort to simulate drug trafficking."
   The ACLU's kind of endless but what if? arguments look
especially absurd in contrast to the explosion of street
crime that followed the invalidation of anti-loitering laws.
"Come on, guys, give us a break," Ms. Clark says of the ACLU.
"The ACLU is stuck in a time warp. They don't see that drugs
are a problem where the black community is being destroyed
from within, not from Jim Crow or bigoted sheriffs."
   Ms. Clark has spent the past decade getting more cops for
her neighborhood, organizing the removal of abandoned cars
and arranging more garbage collections. Now she worries what
will happen if the anti-loitering law unravels. "We need this
law to send a message that we are not going to put up with
drug use."
   Jesse Jennings, another neighborhood resident, recalls
"with great anger and resentment" how the police harassed him
for loitering when he was younger. Like others sick of drug
dealers on the front lawn, Mr. Jennings says the
anti-loitering law is needed to stop "a condition in areas
where large numbers of blacks live, a condition which would
never be tolerated in a predominantly white community."
   This legal battle may indicate a realignment under the
heading of civil rights. Ms. Clark says her community group
is "all Democrats, all blacks," but delighted with its allies
in the case. These include Roger Conner of the ACLU-dogging
American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, the
Washington Legal Foundation and Hager Sharp publicist Steven
Hofman, a former senior Republican staffer. Key Alexandria
legal briefs were written by lawyers donating their efforts,
including former Reagan Justice Department aide Charles
Cooper of the Washington firm Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp;
Trowbridge and lawyers at Washington's Wilmer, Cutler &amp;
Pickering.
   "The idea was in vogue in the 1960s that anything liberals
did was to save the black folks," Ms. Clark says. "They did
play a role then, but we've got different problems now."
Today's choice is this: Will Ms. Clark prevail over blacks'
self-appointed legal guardians at the ACLU? Or is fighting
anti-loitering laws the next symbol of the liberal-plantation
mentality?
   When Congress returns, President Bush will decide if he'll
veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990, more accurately described
as the Racial Quota and Lawyers Enrichment Act. If he does,
he might instead urge laws to empower black communities. Atop
this list would be anti-loitering laws to help protect people
such as Maxine Clark from drugs and crime in their
neighborhoods.
