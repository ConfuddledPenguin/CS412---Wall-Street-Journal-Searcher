   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan installed two of its
own executives at the helm of its struggling Subaru of
America subsidiary, succeeding Harvey H. Lamm, who resigned
as chairman and chief executive officer.
   Masaharu Masumitsu, a former Fuji official who this year
became Subaru's vice chairman, gets the additional post of
chief executive. Takeshi Higurashi, who began his career at
Fuji in 1954 and most recently served as managing director in
charge of Fuji's Subaru Overseas business, becomes chairman
of Cherry Hill, N.J.-based Subaru. The actions come less than
a week after it completed its acquisition of Subaru for about
$208 million.

   Mr. Masumitsu is 54 years old, while Mr. Higurashi is 59.
Thomas R. Gibson, 47, remains Subaru's president and chief
operating officer.
   In a statement, Mr. Lamm said he resigned because of a
"desire to provide a clear path" for the integration of the
manufacturing, product development and sales and marketing
arms of Subaru and Fuji, which makes Subaru cars. Mr. Lamm,
54, is one of the founders of Subaru, which previously had
been an independent distributor of Fuji's cars in the U.S.
   Fuji also said that Marvin S. Riesenbach, executive vice
president and chief financial officer of Subaru, will take
early retirement Oct. 31. Mr. Riesenbach, 59, said he is
leaving to "pursue other interests." A company spokesman said
Fuji plans to fill the position with an American.
   As Subaru's sales continued a three-year slide early this
year, Fuji moved to acquire the 50.4% of Subaru that it
didn't already own.
   Subaru's sales peaked in 1986 at 183,242 cars, which
accounted for 30% of Fuji's total revenue. But sales began to
suffer as Subaru moved outside its four-wheel-drive niche to
challenge such mainstream auto makers as Honda Motor Co. and
Toyota Motor Corp. In 1989, sales dropped to 136,111 cars,
down 26% from 1986.
   Subaru's troubles have hit Fuji hard. The company posted a
net loss of 6 billion yen ($41.6 million) for its year ended
March 31, compared with 6.83 billion yen a year earlier.
Nissan Motor Co., which is Fuji's largest holder with a 4.3%
stake, recently installed one of its former executives at the
helm of Fuji in an effort to help rescue the smaller company.
