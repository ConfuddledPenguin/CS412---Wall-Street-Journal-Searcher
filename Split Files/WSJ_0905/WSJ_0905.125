   Kemper Corp. said five securities units merged into one
unit, Kemper Securities Group Inc. The five firms are Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards Inc.; Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi Inc.;
Boettcher & Co.; Lovett Underwood, Neuhaus &amp; Webb Inc.; and
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
   Each of the units has a seat on the New York Stock
Exchange. In Chicago, a Kemper spokesman said the company has
no plans to sell any of its Big Board seats, but he added,
"We're going to be assessing our needs. We're going to make a
determination on whether we'll need all of the seats."
