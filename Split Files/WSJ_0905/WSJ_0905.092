   RIALTO, Calif. -- The Souzas here have been in the
fireworks-display business for four generations. So have the
Rozzis of Loveland, Ohio, and the Zambellis of New Castle,
Pa. The Gruccis of Brookhaven, N.Y., trace their past to
before Lincoln's presidency.
   In an age when small businesses commonly don't outlast
their founders, the fireworks industry is a monument of
endurance, a throwback to a time when fathers handed their
craft to their children. The experience of these families
offers guidance on a vexing problem: how to get the next
generation ready and willing to take over the family
business.

   Some industries lend themselves to family succession,
consultants say. With an estimated $75 million a year in
revenue, the fireworks-display industry supports several
leading family firms and local concerns. But it isn't big
enough to attract large corporate players. Besides, there are
entry barriers. "There is no school to get a master's degree
in pyrotechnics. It is a thing you learn by apprenticeship
and experience," says Dale Miller of the American
Pyrotechnics Association.
   Of prime importance, the fireworks families get their
children involved and excited. Felix Grucci Jr. recalls as a
young child walking hand in hand with his father as the elder
Grucci set off fireworks at shows. "It was the greatest
thrill of my life," says Mr. Grucci, 39 years old and
president of Fireworks by Grucci Inc.
   James Souza, a director of his family's Pyro-Spectaculars,
says, "I can't remember not being involved in the business."
By the age of 12, he helped set up shows at fairs and
tinkered with designing small-scale sparklers. In his
grandfather's day, says the 38-year-old Mr. Souza, the family
would pack explosive powder into fireworks pieces while at
breakfast.
   The families have their own secret fireworks formulas.
George "Boom Boom" Zambelli, the 66-year-old president of
Zambelli Internationale Fireworks Mfg. Co., still uses the
black book, with formulas in Italian, that was given him by
his father a half century ago. He keeps it in a safe.
   Even vacations contribute. The Souzas have an annual
vacation that attracts as many as 30 family members.
Seventeen Gruccis gather every Sunday for dinner, and "the
topic is always fireworks," says Donna Grucci Butler, one of
eight family members working full time in the business.
During the peak season around July Fourth, up to 150 family
members come in to help. For any family business to last,
"there must be a sense of love and respect in the family,"
says Leon Danco, a Cleveland-based family-business
consultant.
   Many in the industry speak of a magic that attracts them
as children. After all, it's easier to hook a kid on a
business that fills the night sky with color than a business
that hauls toxic waste.
   George Zambelli Jr., the elder Mr. Zambelli's 42-year-old
son, says that through his family's shows he has met every
president since John Kennedy. Long before he was old enough
for a license, he drove the White House tractor to help set
up a show there. Many speak of being performers on a giant
scale. "You can have a whole city as your stage," says Mr.
Souza. For the golden anniversary of San Francisco's Golden
Gate Bridge in 1987, the Souzas draped the span in a
4,200-foot-long waterfall of fire. Mr. Souza was especially
proud because his great-grandfather was involved on the
bridge's opening day.
   Some considered other paths. John Rozzi says he once
thought of working outside the family's Tri-State
Manufacturing Co. "But I figured I would just get swallowed
up in some corporation," he says.
   Mrs. Butler of the Gruccis says she hated fireworks as a
child: "I couldn't stand the noise." But as she grew up, her
mother asked for help in the business, and Mrs. Butler
couldn't say no. Now, she adds, she wouldn't do anything
else.
   The ties must be strong, for fireworks display is a
dangerous business. In 1983, an explosion destroyed the
Grucci factory and killed two people, including Donna and
Felix's brother James. The family discussed quitting, but
decided to rebuild. "It's what my father would have wanted,"
says 26-year-old Felix "Phil" Grucci, one of James's children
and a vice president.
   Mr. Souza says his great-grandfather lost an arm in a
fireworks accident. The same thing happened to a Souza worker
when a shell prematurely exploded during a 1969 show in San
Francisco. Later in the same show another premature explosion
permanently injured his father Robert's fingers, says Mr.
Souza.
   Three years ago, says Mr. Souza, an unhappy worker
committed suicide at the company compound here by igniting
some 30,000 pounds of explosives stored in an underground
bunker. Though no one else was injured, the explosion
registered 1.6 on the Richter scale, says Mr. Souza.
   As this once empty stretch of scrubs some 50 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles begins to fill with subdivisions,
neighbors and officials are pressing the Souzas to leave. The
company is looking for a new site, says Mr. Souza.
   Not all conflicts come with neighbors. Earlier this year,
James Souza resigned as president of Pyro-Spectaculars after
a dispute with his father. He says he wants to sponsor
fireworks events rather than simply put on shows. Though
active in Pyro-Spectaculars, he has his own firm.
   But Mr. Souza has no doubts he would like to see his sons,
ages 14 and 12, become the fifth generation of Souzas to go
into the business. Already, he takes them to shows and asks
their advice on current music to use with the fireworks.
   The other families feel the same. For instance, the senior
Mr. Zambelli says two teen-age granddaughters recently told
him they planned to take over the business someday. "I loved
it," he says.
