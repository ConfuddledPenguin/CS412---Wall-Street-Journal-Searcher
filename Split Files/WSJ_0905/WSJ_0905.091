   The Soviet Union said it is inviting Western oil companies
to bid for rights to explore for and produce oil and gas in
two regions in the Republic of Turkmen.
   The areas cover about 90,000 square kilometers in the
South Caspian and Amu-Daria Oil and Gas Provinces. The Soviet
Ministry of Geology rated the areas as "highly prospective,"
and said there is existing major hydrocarbon production in
the area.

   In a statement, the Ministry of Geology and the government
of the Republic of Turkmen said invitations to bid will be
made available in November and December during a visit to the
U.S. by Soviet oil and gas officials. They said they will
then provide prospective bidders details on the potential of
the areas.
   The Soviet statement said that small tract competitive
bidding will be used to select participating companies,
similar to the bidding format used in the U.S. and some other
countries. In the past, Western oil companies have negotiated
directly with government agencies for the possibility of
joint ventures in large areas.
