   BOSTON -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency here
said AVX Corp., New York, agreed in principle to pay $66
million in one of the largest environmental cleanup
settlements to date under the federal Superfund program, a
program to clean up toxic waste sites.
   AVX, a maker of capacitors, was purchased earlier this
year by Kyocera Corp., a Japanese maker of electronic parts.

   The tentative settlement stems from a civil lawsuit the
federal government filed in 1983 against AVX and four other
companies charged with polluting the New Bedford, Mass.,
harbor with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Under the
settlement, AVX may have to pay more than $66 million if
total cleanup costs exceed $130.5 million, the EPA said. Part
of the AVX payment will go to the state of Massachusetts,
which is assisting in the cleanup.
   Tentative settlements with two other companies involved in
the case, Aerovox Inc. and Belleville Industries Inc., have
been reached but not yet announced, the EPA said. The
government will press its claims against the two remaining
concerns, Federal Pacific Electric Co. and Cornell-Dubilier
Electronics Inc., at a trial scheduled for March 1991, the
EPA added.
   EPA officials said estimated costs for the New Bedford
harbor cleanup, under various options being considered, range
up to $600 million. PCBs, chemicals formerly used in making
electrical insulation and products, can cause liver damage
and cancer. High levels of the chemicals were discovered in
fish and shellfish in the New Bedford harbor in the 1970s;
fishing has subsequently been banned in certain areas of the
harbor and a river estuary leading to it.
   Separately, Kyocera named Benedict Rosen president of AVX.
Mr. Rosen, 54, succeeds Charles Dill, who resigned to pursue
other business interests, the company said. Mr. Rosen takes
the helm after 19 years with AVX, moving up through various
management posts. He will report to AVX's chief executive
officer, Marshall O. Butler.
