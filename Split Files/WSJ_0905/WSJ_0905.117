   Arbitration in high-stakes commercial cases generally
saves companies money in legal fees but, surprisingly,
doesn't speed the process of resolving disputes.
   That's the conclusion of a four-year study by the Rand
Corp.'s Institute for Civil Justice of cases arbitrated in
North Carolina federal court.

   The study indicated that cases bound for trial -- rather
than arbitration -- are resolved just as quickly as
arbitrated cases because the trial-bound cases often are
settled before reaching the courtroom. In contrast, while
arbitration is a faster process than trial, arbitrated cases
more often run their course and don't result in prior
settlements.
   The study also showed that arbitration doesn't reduce the
court system's costs in disposing of civil disputes.
   In recent years, arbitration and other forms of
alternative dispute resolution have been touted as solutions
to a host of problems that plague the civil justice system,
including crowded dockets, slow administration of justice and
the high costs of litigation.
   But, concludes Deborah Hensler, research director for
Rand's Institute for Civil Justice, "Arbitration is not an
efficiency tool." Ms. Hensler adds that arbitration
nonetheless improves the quality of justice because "the
parties believe they get something out of a hearing" before
an impartial body.
   The institute studied the arbitration program in the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. As
in most state and federal courts, the North Carolina system
provided mandatory referral of civil cases to nonbinding
arbitration before a lawyer. The district was unusual,
however, in that it applied the arbitration program to
disputes with as much as $150,000 at stake, instead of just
to smaller claims.
   The study's author, E. Allan Lind, looked at corporate and
individual contract and civil injury cases. Of the 350 cases
he tracked, 210 went through arbitration. The arbitrated
cases took an average of 285 days to be concluded;
nonarbitrated cases took an average of 282 days. Many of the
nonarbitrated cases were resolved in out-of-court
settlements.
   The study estimated that litigants in arbitrated cases
paid an average of $19,972 in total legal fees and costs, and
litigants in nonarbitrated cases paid $25,047. The amount of
damages provided in arbitration was roughly equivalent to
that in cases originally slated for trial.
   Civil litigators for both plaintiffs and defendants say
the Rand study seems to parallel their experience.
   And Robert Coulson, president of the American Arbitration
Association, said the Rand study is "generally consistent"
with other studies of similar nonbinding arbitration systems.

   GAF CORP.'S BATTLE with estate of former chairman Jesse
Werner is revived.
   Justice Harold Baer Jr. ruled last week in Manhattan state
court that a fight between GAF and the estate of Mr. Werner,
who was GAF chairman for 18 years, may go to trial despite a
1987 arbitration ruling that appeared to have ended the
dispute.
   The battle centers on what GAF owed Mr. Werner, now
deceased, when he was ousted in 1983 after he lost a proxy
fight to a shareholder group led by current chairman Samuel
J. Heyman.
   Among other things, Mr. Werner, who died in April 1986,
claimed that the new board had illegally cut off his salary
and benefits and had denied him stock options. An arbitration
panel in 1987 awarded Mr. Werner's estate $2.8 million plus
interest out of the $7.6 million sought for the alleged
violations of his 1981 employment contract. Further, the
arbitration panel dismissed counterclaims filed by GAF.
   But both GAF and the Werner estate had also filed suits
against each other in state court. In its suit, GAF alleged,
among other things, that the former chairman and his board
had wasted corporate funds through excessive stock options
and prodigious pension and salary payments to Mr. Werner.
Meanwhile, the Werner estate alleged that GAF had improperly
interfered with Mr. Werner's stock options.
   Justice Baer ordered both sides to meet next Monday to
discuss a settlement or set a trial date. If there is a
trial, the justice is expected to combine the two pending
suits.

   DAVID SOUTER gets top American Bar Association
endorsement.
   The ABA's judicial selection panel rated Mr. Souter, the
Supreme Court nominee, "well qualified," the legal
organization's highest endorsement.
   The ABA's 15-member Standing Committee on the Federal
Judiciary voted unanimously for the certification. Mr.
Souter, a former member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court,
was nominated by President Bush in July to fill the vacancy
created by the retirement of Justice William Brennan. Mr.
Souter received a similar "well-qualified" rating from the
ABA earlier this year when he was nominated for a seat on the
First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.
   Republicans are likely to stress the ABA endorsement in
pushing for Mr. Souter's confirmation by the Senate. Some
liberal Democrats may use the occasion to question the
criteria the ABA uses in its judicial evaluation process. The
Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin hearings on
the Souter nomination Sept. 13.
   One member of the ABA panel is William Brennan III, a
lawyer in Princeton, N.J., who is Justice Brennan's son.

   IRAN-CONTRA prosecutor Lawrence Walsh asked a federal
appeals court panel to reconsider its 2-1 decision that set
aside the three felony convictions of former White House aide
Oliver North. Mr. Walsh addressed his petition to the
three-judge panel but suggested a rehearing by the full
12-member U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. In its July 20 ruling, the three-judge panel
ordered a witness-by-witness examination of the testimony
against Mr. North to determine whether the trial was unfairly
tainted by references to testimony the retired Marine
lieutenant colonel gave Congress under a limited grant of
immunity. Chief Judge Patricia Wald dissented, saying that
Mr. North received a fair, though not a perfect, trial.

   A FORMER TAKEOVER LAWYER at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
&amp; Flom and a former money manager pleaded innocent to insider
trading charges. But lawyers involved in the case said that
both defendants could change their pleas to guilty later this
month if an appropriate plea bargain is worked out. The
government filed the criminal charges last month against
Steven L. Glauberman, a former Skadden Arps associate, and
Peter H. Jeffer, who headed Jeffer Management Corp. Eugene
Propper, who is representing Mr. Jeffer, said the parties
need more time to work out an acceptable plea bargain. Martin
Perschetz, an attorney for Mr. Glauberman, declined to
comment.

   MCKENNA, CONNER &amp; CUNEO announced that it split into two
firms effective Sept 1. McKenna &amp; Fitting, with 65 attorneys
in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., will
emphasize its financial institutions and business litigation
practices. McKenna &amp; Cuneo, with 201 lawyers in Washington,
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver, will concentrate on
regulatory and government contracts work, as well as
environmental and international law. McKenna Conner was
formed in a merger of Los Angeles and Washington firms in
1980. The current division back into two firms "is based
primarily on practice specialties and not along geographic
lines," said Charles E. Yonkers, managing partner of McKenna
&amp; Cuneo.

   TERMINATION CASE DISMISSED: A federal judge threw out a
suit brought by an ex-partner of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby &amp;
MacRae, a New York law firm. In the suit filed last year in
federal court in Manhattan, Alison Clapp, 38 years old,
accused the firm of violating federal employee-benefit laws
as well as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
law by terminating her as a partner in 1989. In court
documents, the law firm said it dismissed Ms. Clapp because
it was dissatisfied with her work in its tax department. Ms.
Clapp's lawyer, Daniel J. O'Callaghan, said she will appeal.
