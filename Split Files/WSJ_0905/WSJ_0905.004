   LONDON -- Even in a country that loves a good whodunit,
the House of Lords seems an unlikely site for a poisoning.
Consider, then, the case of Baron Hooson, distinguished Welsh
barrister and politician.
   On the afternoon of May 5, 1988, the baron lunched on a
salmon-and-mayonnaise sandwich in the members-only Bishops
Bar at the House of Lords. "I was amazed the next day when I
felt very ill," he recalls. Suffering from severe nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea, Lord Hooson managed to travel home to
Wales by train. "It took me three weeks in all to recover,"
he says. "I lost a stone {14 pounds} in less than a week."

   Telephoned by sheepish Westminster officials, the baron
learned he was one among some 120 peers poisoned at the House
of Lords. The culprit: "Salmonella enteritidis," contained in
the eggs used to make mayonnaise in the Lords' kitchen. "I
was astounded," Lord Hooson says.
   The baron may be a peer of the realm, but his experience
is all too common. Scarcely a month seems to pass in Britain
without a new food-poisoning scare. Over the past two years,
a series of outbreaks -- some resulting in deaths -- has made
many here wonder if anything is safe to eat.
   Red meat? "Mad cow disease" has scratched beef off many
menus. Chicken or eggs? A huge outbreak of salmonella in
poultry led to the slaughter of more than one million
infected hens. Soft cheese? Listeria poisoning from
unpasteurized varieties has been linked to miscarriages.
Don't eat the shellfish from Britain's sewage-contaminated
North Sea coast. And don't drink the water in Hampshire: It's
infested with tiny shrimps, some of them alive.
   In the old joke, hell is where the chefs are British. But
British food has gone one step beyond the merely bad. Now, it
is dangerous.
   "We've got our just deserts," declares Richard Lacey,
professor of microbiology at Leeds University and an expert
on food poisoning. British food, he says, "is cheap and nasty
-- it's basically unsafe."
   Last year, England and Wales reported nearly 30,000 cases
of salmonella, including 61 deaths. The U.S., with a
population nearly quintuple that of England and Wales, had
about 40,000 reported cases.
   A recent survey of 5,000 eateries in England and Wales
found that nearly one in eight presents a "significant or
imminent health risk." Fish-and-chip fanciers should take
particular care; 19% of "takeaway" restaurants posed a health
hazard. Oxford University's Keble College recently was fined
$1,900 for selling food deemed unfit for human consumption.
   All this isn't so surprising, given that Britain has never
protected its citizens from their own worst food habits.
Loath to coddle tummies, the Nanny State has no national
equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   The result is a catalog of lackadaisical management from
farmyard to dinner plate. Pigs and poultry are given feed
made from ground-up carcasses of other, possibly diseased,
animals. Once in stores, food isn't always properly
refrigerated. Some items languish on open shelves; others sit
in "chill cabinets" with temperatures as high as 68 degrees
Fahrenheit. Restaurants aren't licensed. They aren't even
inspected before opening.
   Stung by its record on food safety, the Thatcher
government just passed a new law aimed at tightening
regulations. David Maclean, the government minister in charge
of food safety, insists the law will give health inspectors
"all the powers they need" to fight food poisoning. "We'll
not let any filthy, scruffy little takeaways damage the
reputations of our excellent restaurants," he says.
   Of course, this being Britain, the food scares also have
been fodder for merriment and finger-pointing. When soft
cheese was implicated in listeria poisoning, tabloid
newspapers dubbed the uproar "listeria hysteria" -- and
blamed the French.
   At the height of the salmonella-in-eggs scare last fall,
nuns at a rural convent in the Midlands refused a government
order to slaughter their infected flock. Led by their
82-year-old Mother Superior, six sisters locked themselves in
their henhouse for three hours while a government
veterinarian hammered on the door.
   But it was the death of Max that really caused a stir.
Last May, this five-year-old Siamese cat from Bristol
succumbed to the ravages of mad cow disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which makes cows' brains go
spongy and causes the animals to stagger and foam at the
mouth.
   The government insists there isn't any proof humans are at
risk from eating contaminated beef; yet Max had been fed
beef, and his demise prompted fears that BSE can, indeed,
pass among species.
   British beef consumption plunged 25%. Italy, West Germany
and France banned imports. To bolster confidence, members of
Parliament staged a televised tasting of steak tartare (raw
beef and raw egg), and Agriculture Minister John Selwyn
Gummer was photographed coaxing his 4-year-old daughter to
eat a hamburger. Eventually, import bans were lifted and beef
sales rebounded. But the European boycott cost the beef
industry $57 million.
   Beginning in January, the food-safety rule will, for the
first time, require training for anyone who handles food. It
will strengthen inspectors' powers to close flagrant
offenders. Food outlets will have to register their existence
with local officials.
   As a borough health inspector, Samy Sinniah has seen the
food horror-show up close. For seven years, he has waded
through the grime of middling restaurants. During one recent
inspection, he found such basic problems as food kept in open
cans, an uncovered garbage pail and a food-storage shed that
wasn't "vermin-proof."
   On his scale of one-to-10, with 10 being the best, the
place merited a five. "Six is bad," he says. "I give a lot of
sixes." Though Mr. Sinniah can bring flagrant or persistent
violators to court, his powers generally fall short of health
inspectors in the U.S., who can close unsafe restaurants
faster.
   Even under new laws, food premises won't be licensed, so
health officers can't prevent a scuzzy place from opening.
"It's crazy," says Bob Tanner, a former public-health
official. "It's like taking a car onto the highway and saying
to the authorities: `Look, guys, I'm driving this thing now;
if you want to catch up with me later to see if it's safe, do
so.'"
   Britons have now faced up to the fact that nothing sacred
is free of taint -- not the House of Lords, not Oxford
University, not the henhouse of a religious order. Even
home-cooking is suspect.
   One problem here is that women have joined the work force,
and they, like many other workers, want easy-to-prepare
dinners. In Britain, these are found on "chill displays" at
grocery stores. These displays are stacked with prepared
potato salads doused in mayonnaise, vivid orange and green
cole slaw, creamy "roule" cheeses, as well as Indian-style
chicken kabobs and Italian-style lasagna.
   Often these foods aren't chilled -- or they are just kind
of chilled, making them breeding grounds for germs. New
government regulations will require shops to lower the
thermostats.
   But that isn't enough to save British consumers from their
own ineptness, say British food experts. They fear Brits
can't be trusted to properly cook the "chill display" items
that need to be reheated. Says Mr. Lacey, the professor:
"It's all part of the convenience revolution, and the use of
microwave ovens. Food is reheated, but never cooked through.
The food industry is producing what it thinks the public
wants -- instant meals -- and the public is not cooking them
as thoroughly as they should."
   Quite a change from days of yore, says Stephen James, head
of chemical engineering at the Institute of Food Research in
Bristol. "Ten years ago in England, everyone went home to a
roast cooked by a housewife," he says. "There's very little
danger in something cooked for four hours in a 200-degree
Celsius oven. But it's a different attitude altogether now."
