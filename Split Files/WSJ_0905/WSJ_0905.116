   CHICAGO -- Wheat prices continued to slide toward the
depressed levels of 1987 while soybean prices rose amid signs
that the Southeast drought is worsening.
   Prices of wheat futures contracts fell in the wake of
reports that Canada and the European Community are arranging
shipment of large amounts of low-priced wheat to countries,
such as China, Egypt and Japan, traders said yesterday.

   Canada, for example, is rumored to be selling 1.3 million
metric tons of wheat to international exporters, which would
then sell the grain overseas, said Robert Lekberg, an analyst
at Farmers Grain &amp; Livestock Corp., Chicago.
   The sales are taking potential business away from U.S.
wheat exporters, whose business has been lackluster for
several months. U.S. wheat exports so far this summer have
been running about 30% below the summer of 1989, traders
said.
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the futures
contracts for delivery of soft red winter wheat fell to new
life-of-contract lows. The wheat contract for September
delivery dropped 6.25 cents a bushel to settle at $2.5625 a
bushel.
   The world wheat trade is extremely competitive this year
because good growing weather across much of the Northern
Hemisphere is increasing stockpiles. That has allowed some
major importing nations to become more self-sufficient at the
same time that some major exporting nations have more grain
to sell.
   All this is a rapid change from earlier this year. Two
years of drought had reduced U.S. stockpiles to their
tightest level since the early 1970s.
   Those stockpiles began rebuilding after strong harvests
from the Southern Plains to the Midwest. According to the
Agriculture Department, U.S. wheat stockpiles in 1991 should
climb about 52% from this year. Meanwhile, stockpiles outside
the U.S. are expected to climb about 9%.
   So far, moves by the U.S. government to buttress U.S.
wheat prices seem to have had little impact. Last month, the
Agriculture Department announced that it would refill a
special wheat reserve that is used to provide emergency food
aid to developing countries. The government also plans to
require wheat farmers enrolled in its price-support program
to idle between 10% and 20% of their wheat acreage.
   Some analysts are speculating that President Bush might
offer credit to the Soviet Union to use for grain purchases
when he meets Sunday with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The Soviets have expressed interest in $2 billion in
credits, but to qualify, they would first have to gain
most-favored nation status from Congress. To do that, the
Soviets are moving to liberalize their immigration law.
   Most grain analysts doubt that the Soviet Union would buy
any substantial amount of U.S. crops until at least next
month without some sort of incentive.
   Soybean prices increased amid speculation that hot and dry
conditions will reduce yields in the Mississippi Delta and
the Southeast. Although growing conditions have been poor in
those areas through the summer, the weather there hasn't had
much impact on U.S. crop prices until now. Most of the
nation's soybeans are produced in the Midwest, where growing
conditions are generally good.
   In June, much of the Georgia corn crop was lost when hot
and dry conditions hit during the crucial pollination period.
The weather moderated in July.
   But in August, the soybean growing region of Georgia
received only 25% of normal rainfall, according to Mike
Palmerino, senior agricultural meteorologist at Weather
Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass.
   In central Mississippi, some cities received only 3% of
normal August rainfall, he said.
   It is difficult to project the amount of damage done to
the soybean crop already. The soybean plant generally
survives drought conditions better than corn, in part because
it can reflower.
   Most corn prices rose slightly.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed and little
changed. December delivery gold ended with a gain of $1.30 an
ounce at $390.50. December silver was off 4.3 cents an ounce
to $4.8250. October platinum rose $2.10 an ounce to $486.40.
Gold prices advanced slightly in early trading when it was
reported that U.S. Navy units had stopped an Iraqi ship in a
search for arms, an analyst said. The concern faded when the
ship was found to contain tea, the analyst said. A comment by
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker that a diplomatic
settlement of the Mideast crisis was premature contributed
underlying support, said the analyst. However, a somewhat
stronger tone to the dollar may be limiting gains in gold, he
said. The December silver contract was particularly weak,
falling to a life-of-contract low of $4.7850 before partially
recovering. The major price-depressant in silver is that
demand for its bullion is almost nonexistent, the analyst
said. As a result, another analyst said, the gold-silver
ratio has widened to 81 to 1 in favor of gold, compared with
a more normal 45 or 50 to 1. "What this tells me is that the
ratio can continue to widen regardless of the direction of
the market," he said. "If developments trigger a price rise,
gold is likely to advance more strongly than silver. In a
decline, silver will fall more than gold."
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices eased in quiet trading. The
December contract fell 1.05 cents a pound to $1.2375. London
Metal Exchange inventories of copper declined 525 tons to
132,550 tons, the exchange said yesterday. The Peruvian mine
strike, now in its third week, is expected to be resolved
soon, one analyst said. He noted that copper statistics
tended to reflect a slowing U.S. economy. U.S. brass and wire
mill consumption of copper for the first seven months of the
year was down slightly, compared with the year-earlier
period, he said. Consumer stocks of copper have risen 23%
from their low point in February, and, during the same time,
producer inventories of copper have increased by 77%, he
noted. Another analyst said that some selling of copper on
the London Metal Exchange was attributed to West German
dealers. He observed that European demand for copper has
slowed. The strong buying in Europe that took place during
the summer may have been purchases that normally occur in the
fall, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were slightly higher. The December
contract ended with a gain of 0.65 cent a pound at 72.84
cents. Trade and speculative buying helped prices recover
from early losses, according to one analyst. There is some
concern over the progress of the cotton crop in the northern
areas of the Mississippi Delta, such as northern Mississippi
and Arkansas, he said. The crop in those areas got off to a
late start due to wet weather but since then has suffered a
dearth of moisture, which could reduce yields, he noted. Also
contributing underlying support to prices is the continuing
low amount of cotton certified for delivery against futures
contracts on the Cotton Exchange, he said.
