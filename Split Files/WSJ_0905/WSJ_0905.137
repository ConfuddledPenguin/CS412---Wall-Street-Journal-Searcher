   SUFFIELD, Conn. -- Suffield Financial Corp. said the
president and chief executive officer of its Coastal Savings
Bank unit filed suit against Suffield Financial in Maine
Superior Court for attempting to dismiss them.
   Suffield Financial, a bank holding company, voted in late
July to negotiate, by mutual consent, the termination of
Richard Paige, the chief executive, and James McKay, the
president, of Coastal Savings.

   Unsuccessful in its negotiations, Suffield then voted to
remove the directors of Coastal Bancorp, a subsidiary of
Suffield Financial and parent of Coastal Savings, and replace
them with new directors. The new Coastal Bancorp board has
now called a shareholders meeting in order to consider the
removal of the directors of Coastal Savings.
   Suffield said it took such action because "a change in
Coastal's management would enhance the future profitability
of Coastal Savings." While Coastal Savings is "financially
sound," the bank hasn't been as profitable as it could be,
said Suffield Financial.
   Messrs. Paige and McKay, who are joined in their suit by
certain other directors of Coastal Savings, said in their
suit that the actions of Suffield Financial are "illegal and
invalid."
   Suffield has removed the lawsuit to the U.S. District
Court in Maine.
