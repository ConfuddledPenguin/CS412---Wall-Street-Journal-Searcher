   AmBase Corp. said it agreed to sell Commonwealth Insurance
Co., a Vancouver unit of its Home Insurance Co. subsidiary,
to Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., Toronto, for $49 million.
   An AmBase spokesman said the sale would have no impact on
previously announced agreements to sell Home Insurance or a
controlling interest in the company because Home Insurance
would retain proceeds from the Commonwealth sale.

   AmBase, New York, agreed to sell a 50.1% stake in the
company to an investor group a week after reaching a separate
agreement to sell Home Insurance to Vik Brothers
International. AmBase said it would proceed with both offers
until a definitive agreement is reached with one or the
other. Neither investment group could be reached yesterday.
   AmBase said Commonwealth, which has about 120 employees,
offers commercial property and oil and gas insurance in
Canada, the U.S. and overseas.
   Separately, Markel Corp. reached a tentative agreement
under which it would acquire Fairfax's 47.5% stake in F-M
Acquisition Corp. for $45 million cash, plus securities that
Fairfax valued at about $23 million. Markel, a Richmond, Va.,
insurance marketing concern, already owns about 42.5% of
closely held F-M Acquisition, a specialty insurer in
Evanston, Ill.
   The securities Markel would swap for F-M include about
850,000 subordinate voting shares, and 800,000 multiple
voting shares, of Fairfax. The shares, which Fairfax values
at about $16 million, account for about 23% of Fairfax's
equity and a 31% voting interest.
   The tentative agreement also calls for Markel to transfer
$7 million of preferred shares of Lindsey &amp; Newsom Claim
Services Inc., to Fairfax and transfer its 50% stake in
Lindsey &amp; Newsom to Morden &amp; Helwig Group Inc. for $8.3
million. Morden &amp; Helwig is a Toronto-based claims-management
concern 55% owned by Fairfax. Lindsey &amp; Newsom is a Tyler,
Texas, claims adjuster that already is 50%-held by Morden &amp;
Helwig.
   The transactions are subject to a number of conditions,
Fairfax said.
