   DALLAS -- The Amalgamated Transit Union will stop paying
striking Greyhound Lines Inc. employees $50 a week in strike
benefits as of Sept. 13, union President James La Sala said
in a letter to officers of the Washington, D.C., union.
   About 6,000 members of the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, an ATU bargaining unit, have been on
strike against the GLI Holding Co. unit since March 2.

   Mr. La Sala said the Greyhound strike benefits, totaling
about $300,000 a week, had depleted the union's strike fund
to about $2 million. Further payments would make it difficult
for the union to pay legal fees in connection with recent
efforts to negotiate a bid to buy the bus company, he said.
   Mr. La Sala said the termination of benefits wasn't a sign
that the union is abandoning the strike. "We intend to
continue this fight for as long as it may take until it is
won or the company is destroyed," he said in the letter.
   Battered by strike-related violence, Greyhound Lines filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code in June. The union is currently in
negotiations with Blackstone Group, a New York investment
banking firm, on a possible employee-led bid for the company.
