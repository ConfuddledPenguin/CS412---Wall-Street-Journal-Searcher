   In a move that shocked international bond traders, the
West German government turned down all bids from a group of
banks for 2.5 billion marks ($1.58 billion) of bonds.
   The rejection came after the banks, burned by an
underwriting of similar 8.75%, 10-year bonds on Monday, bid
lower prices for the new offering. Because bond yields move
in the opposite direction of prices, the banks' bids raised
prospective interest rates higher than the West German
Finance Ministry was willing to pay for its debt.

   Traders and analysts interpreted the banks' demand for
higher yields as a sign that global capital markets are
becoming saturated by the large volume of West German
government debt needed to finance the unification of East and
West Germany.
   "It also reflected a belief that inflationary pressures
associated with the merger of the two countries are building
and that interest rates are expected to climb further," said
Nicholas P. Sargen, a director of bond-market research at
Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
   "The capital market is being burdened like never before,"
said Gert Schmidt, an economist for Industriekreditbank AG in
Dusseldorf. "The question is, how much can it take before
interest rates go higher? It looks as if higher interest
rates are to be the price of unity and the price of not
raising taxes."
   On Monday, a consortium of West German banks and foreign
financial institutions that are licensed to do banking
business in West Germany purchased 2.5 billion marks of
10-year, 8.75%, so-called unity bonds at a discount of 99.20
to yield 8.88%.
   This was to be the first part of a two-part offering, the
second portion being yesterday's tender auction to the same
banking syndicate that underwrote Monday's sale. West German
bankers said yesterday's auction also was supposed to be for
2.5 billion marks.
   But after purchasing the initial 2.5 billion-mark segment
on Monday, the banks discovered yesterday that they couldn't
sell the bonds. "This morning {Tuesday}, there was
disappointment in the market, because it expected a 9%
coupon. The moment the market opened today, the price fell to
98.30," an executive at a big West German bank said. "So we
couldn't sell it {at a profit}. Because the {8.75%} coupon
was so low, it didn't even sell at 99.20, the price at which
we had underwritten it."
   He added that the bank syndicate then offered to buy the
second 2.5 billion-mark portion at 98.10. But "they didn't
accept this offer," he said. Only the Bundesbank, the West
German central bank, tendered on the government's terms,
taking 500 million marks on its books.
   West Germany first began using the two-step method of
selling 10-year government bonds -- an underwriting
syndicate, followed by an auction the next day -- last month,
when it sold six billion marks of unity bonds. Traditionally,
it has sold government debt through an underwriting syndicate
in the same manner as U.S. corporations sell debt to
investors. But traders said the new approach reflected an
evolutionary process that would eventually lead to a
competitive tender system similar to that used by the U.S.
Treasury.
   But traders criticized the two-part system as awkward. A
trader at a West German bank in New York groused, "It is
neither fish nor fowl."
   The problem is that investors who buy the bonds on the
first day can find that the securities have fallen in price
at the time of the second offering on the following day.
"That's what happened in this case; it was clear the issue
was under water," the trader said. "If you are an investor
and subscribe on day one, you are at risk, depending on the
bidding for the second half of the deal. It can go for you or
against you."
   Still, a banker in Frankfurt saw a silver lining in
Tuesday's debacle: "Maybe this was best thing. . . . What we
are moving towards is a full auction, which we do not have."
   Some analysts contended that yesterday's rejected bid
raised the odds that the Bonn government would have to raise
taxes to finance the rebuilding of East Germany, which it
estimates could cost 100 billion marks ($63.37 billion)
annually for the next few years.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel,
who hope to lead the first government elected by a united
Germany since the early 1930s after all-German elections
scheduled for Dec. 2, have firmly ruled out boosting taxes.
The Bonn government has argued that unification can be
financed by existing tax levels -- enhanced by West Germany's
strong growth -- and more borrowing.
   Nonetheless, Chancellor Kohl's opponent in the December
election, Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine, is insisting that
West Germany has no choice but to raise taxes. And some
private analysts agree.
   "I see tax increases after the elections," said Eckhard
Cornehl, an economist with Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt. At
the very least, analysts argue that Bonn will have to forgo
corporate tax cuts scheduled for next year.
   Meanwhile, the bond market is feeling the brunt of such
pressures. Ten-year West German government bonds closed to
yield 8.97% yesterday; and at one point in intraday trading,
they were yielding more than 9%. "Clearly the market has
established new higher levels," said John Lipsky, an
international economist at Salomon Brothers in London.
