   WASHINGTON -- The International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization (Intelsat) filed a counterclaim
against Martin Marietta Corp. seeking $400 million in damages
for the failed launch of a $150 million communications
satellite.
   The satellite, launched March 14 from a Martin Marietta
Titan III rocket, ended up in a useless orbit after the
system that separated the satellite from the rocket
malfunctioned. Martin Marietta later blamed the trouble on a
"wiring problem, undetected by the processes and test
procedures used in pre-launch checkout."

   The original claim by Martin Marietta and the counterclaim
are an important test of satellite launch contracts. Martin
Marietta said in its complaint that if its contract can't be
enforced, the company will have to boost the price of its
Titan III launches, which could make its commercial launch
business uncompetitive.
   Intelsat, an international consortium, argued that Martin
Marietta failed to live up to its contractual obligation and
that slip-ups by the company's management and employees
resulted in the launch failure.
   The claim, filed in federal court in Baltimore Friday,
responds to a complaint filed July 6 by Martin Marietta. The
giant defense contractor, anticipating a lawsuit from
Intelsat, asked the court for a ruling that under the launch
contract, Intelsat assumed the risk of loss of its satellite.
Intelsat, it said, was offered insurance against a launch
failure, but decided against buying it.
