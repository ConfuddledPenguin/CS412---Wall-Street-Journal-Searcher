   NEW YORK -- In the days immediately after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, with the stock market sinking like a
stone, Ken Lay, a director of Compaq Computer Corp., says he
decided it was "time to hedge my bets a little bit."
   Mr. Lay lightened his holdings of several stocks -- except
for energy issues -- including Compaq Computer, filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission show. He sold 5,000
Compaq shares, which represented 33% of his Compaq holdings,
for $270,000.

   "I was concerned about the overall tone of the market, and
about the Middle East," Mr. Lay said. While Compaq management
is doing "a superb job," he said, "even good companies, in a
downdraft like this, get hurt."
   Mr. Lay sold his shares for $54 each on Aug. 10. In New
York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Compaq closed at
$47.875, up $1.50. Now, Mr. Lay says, the stock represents a
buying opportunity -- and he says he plans to buy some as
soon as SEC rules allow.
   For officers, directors and other corporate insiders, the
stock-market turmoil resulting from the Middle East crisis
has been a test of faith. This is "the most important period
for insider filings since October 1987," when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average crashed 22.6% in a single day, said Robert
Gabele, president of Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., company
that compiles and analyzes the SEC insider data. In a period
of uncertainty such as the present, he said, "insider buys
are important as a sign of confidence."
   So far, fewer than one-third of the insider filings that
are due for August have come in (the deadline for them is
Sept. 10). But from the early returns, the news appears to be
good for the stock market. "The significant buys outnumber
the sells so far," said Mr. Gabele, even though sells
normally outnumber buys by 2-1.
   Still, he cautioned, insiders tend to report stock
purchases to the SEC immediately and not to report sales
until the deadline looms. Moreover, there has been no
evidence of "cluster buying" at companies immediately after
the invasion of Kuwait. In other words, while one company
official may have felt bullish enough to make a sizable
investment, there were few companywide insider-buying
initiatives.
   For John Deutch, provost of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Citicorp stock looked too good to pass up on the
day Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait. At $19.25 a share, the
stock was little changed from its $19.375 closing level of
the day before but was near the low end of its 52-week
trading range of $17.25 to $35.50.
   "I think it's a terrific stock to own, and every time the
price goes down . . . it's so attractive to me, I buy," he
said.
   Mr. Deutch, a director of the New York-based banking
giant, purchased 5,000 common shares Aug. 2 for $96,250. The
purchase increased his holdings 39%, according to SEC
filings. While Mr. Deutch has served on the boards of six
companies in the past decade, this was his largest purchase
of stock in several years, according to SEC filings.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Citicorp
closed yesterday at $18.375 a share, down 12.5 cents.
   Another large recent purchase was made by James Morrison,
a director of Lyondell Petrochemical Co., Houston. SEC
filings show he bought 9,000 shares for $156,420 on Aug. 3.
The purchase increased his holdings by 43%. He wasn't
available for comment.
   Mr. Morrison paid $17.38 a share. The stock closed in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday at $17.50, up
50 cents.
   Samuel Bodman, chairman of Cabot Corp., spent $326,000 on
Aug. 7 to buy the company's shares, SEC filings show. The
purchase increased his stake in the Waltham, Mass., energy
and chemicals concern by 5%, according to the filings. Mr.
Bodman wasn't available for comment.
   He paid $32.61 a share. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, Cabot closed yesterday at $28.375.
   In one of the largest stock sales of the week after the
invasion of Kuwait, Robert E. Wycoff, president of Atlantic
Richfield Co., sold 3,737 of its shares for $506,075. The
shares represented 10% of his holdings in the Los
Angeles-based oil company, according to SEC filings. The Aug.
8 sale came when some investment advisers were recommending
Atlantic Richfield stock.
   Mr. Wycoff wasn't available for comment, and the company
declined to comment. He received an average price of $135.42
a share, according to SEC filings. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Atlantic Richfield closed at
$135.625 a share.
   Steven C. Mendell, chairman of Xoma Corp., a Berkeley,
Calif., drug company, sold 17,281 shares on Aug. 3 for
$391,392, his first sale ever, according to SEC filings.
Company officials said he sold for "personal and tax
reasons."
   The shares represented 30% of his Xoma stock. Mr. Mendell
was out of the country and couldn't be reached for comment.
But the company said Mr. Mendell's stock holding alone
doesn't give a true picture of his stake in the company. In
addition to his 42,000 shares of Xoma, Mr. Mendell owns
options to purchase 257,800 shares, officials said. About
one-third of those options are vested and can be exercised at
any time, they said.
   Mr. Mendell received $22.65 a share for his holdings,
according to SEC filings. In over-the-counter trading
yesterday, Xoma closed at $19.
