   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc. said it
plans a two-step transaction under which it would acquire a
big gold-copper property in north-central British Columbia,
for about 260.8 million Canadian dollars (US$225.5 million).
   The proposed purchase of the Mount Milligan gold-copper
property would add about 6.2 million ounces of gold and
900,000 metric tons of copper to Placer Dome's existing
reserves. Vancouver-based Continental Gold Corp., which
currently owns 69.8% of Mount Milligan, expected to bring the
property into production by early 1993.

   Under terms of the transaction, Placer Dome said it agreed
to acquire BP Canada Inc.'s 30.2% stake in Mount Milligan for
C$78.8 million, subject to regulatory approval. Once
completed, Placer Dome said it then plans an offer to acquire
all of Continental's 9.1 million fully diluted common shares
outstanding.
   Placer Dome said it would offer C$20 or one Placer Dome
common share for each Continental share outstanding, for a
total indicated value of C$182 million. A group of
Continental insiders who hold a combined 30% stake in the
company have already agreed to tender their stock to Placer
Dome's bid, it said, provided the offer is made by Oct. 22.
   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Placer Dome's
shares closed at C$20.375 each, down 12.5 Canadian cents, and
Continental closed at C$19.625, up C$2.625.
   If successful, Placer Dome's purchase of Mount Milligan
would mark the second step by the big gold producer this year
to bolster its North American gold reserves. Earlier this
summer, Placer Dome acquired a minority stake in British
Columbia's rich Eskay Creek gold project.
   Placer Dome has been seeking to expand its holdings in
North America, where gold reserves tend to be more highly
valued than in regions that are viewed by investors as less
politically stable. A sizable chunk of Placer Dome's existing
reserves are in Papua, New Guinea.
