   PARIS -- Tuffier-Ravier-Py &amp; Associes, a French brokerage
firm that filed for bankruptcy in July, will be taken over by
Francis Lagarde, a businessman who is backed by state-owned
bank Credit Lyonnais.
   A Paris commercial tribunal cleared Mr. Lagarde's bid for
the brokerage firm under a complex deal that includes an
offer for all outstanding shares of the parent company,
Tuffier &amp; Associes, on the Paris bourse, a stock exchange
spokesman said.

   Under the terms of the operation as cleared by the
tribunal, Mr. Lagarde will pay 156 million francs ($29
million) for the brokerage firm, in addition to setting aside
135 million francs to help reimburse any clients whose losses
are not covered by the existing stock market guarantee fund.
He will also inject about 100 million francs to recapitalize
the brokerage firm and guarantee to maintain a staff of 129
people.
   Mr. Lagarde, who owns a credit lease operation in Nantes,
is backed by Altus Finance, a financial investment group
formerly owned by Thomson-CSF and now controlled by Credit
Lyonnais.
   Tuffier officials were unavailable for comment. Tuffier,
the largest independent brokerage firm in Paris, filed for
bankruptcy after running up heavy losses this year. Thierry
Tuffier, the group's chairman, blamed the group's troubles on
a sharp fall in commissions and a decline in trading volume
on the Paris stock market.
   Tuffier's demise raised fears that other independent
brokerage firms, which did not sell out to domestic and
foreign financial institutions after the 1988 Paris bourse
reforms, could suffer a similar fate.
