   THE WHITE HOUSE ASKED Congress to forgive Egypt's $7
billion military debt.
   The Bush administration, which is seeking to reward Egypt
for its support in the Mideast, also signaled it anticipates
having a long-term presence in the Persian Gulf even after
the current crisis ends. In the Gulf of Oman, the U.S. Navy
took its most direct action yet to enforce a U.N. embargo on
trade with Iraq as American sailors boarded an Iraqi-flagged
freighter. Twenty-five Americans were among nearly 300
Western women and children who arrived in Jordan's capital on
three Iraqi Airways planes.

   The Soviet president attended the opening of the Russian
Republic's Communist Party congress, where he was criticized
for his handling of ethnic clashes and food shortages. A
leader of the party's traditionalist wing said Gorbachev's
economic program is "on the brink of collapse."
