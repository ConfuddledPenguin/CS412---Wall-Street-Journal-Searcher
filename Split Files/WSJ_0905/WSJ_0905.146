   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. said it arranged for a $416 million
refinancing of its London office complex through Sumitomo
Life Insurance Co. of Japan.
   The New York-based bank holding company said it had
entered into an agreement with Sumitomo Life that would give
the Japanese insurance company a 52.5% stake on a structured
basis of Morgan Place, the office complex it is building at
60 Victoria Embankment.

   Under terms of the agreement, J.P. Morgan would receive a
25-year lease with renewal options for 50 years. The company
said no immediate gain would be realized from the transaction
and that the benefits would be realized over the 25-year life
of the lease.
