   CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Morgan's Foods Inc. said it will sell
an additional 600,000 of its common shares under a rights
offering.
   The operator of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants said
Whale Securities Co. will act as placement agent for the
shares and any shares not purchased through its previously
announced rights offering.

   The offering provides that each shareholder can purchase,
for $1 a share, one common share for every two shares owned.
Morgan's Foods has 11,848,000 shares outstanding.
   In addition, the company said Citicorp North America Inc.,
a unit of Citicorp, has agreed to refinance about $19 million
of its debt. The refinancing agreement is contingent upon the
accumulation by the company of at least $3 million in the
rights offering. The commitment also provides a $3 million
line of credit for remodeling or buying more restaurants.
