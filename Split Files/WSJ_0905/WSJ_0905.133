   MGM Grand Air said it signed a letter of proposal to buy
two Boeing 757-200s for more than $100 million as part of a
long-term plan to expand the small luxury airline.
   Charles L. Demoney, president and chief executive officer
of the Los Angeles-based airline, said the long-range
aircraft from Boeing Co. are scheduled to be delivered in the
mid-1990s. MGM Grand Air, a unit of MGM Grand Inc., is
controlled by investor Kirk Kerkorian.

   MGM Grand offers two daily flights between Los Angeles and
New York. Eventually, MGM Grand hopes to use the quieter and
more fuel-efficient 757s for international service to the
United Kingdom and the Pacific Rim.
   Last month, MGM Grand began offering an upgraded service
for standard coach-class fare on its newly configured DC-8
Super 62 aircraft. Those planes, which cost $55.5 million to
refurbish, seat 81 passengers and replaced an older fleet of
Boeing 727-100s that MGM Grand used to launch the airline in
1987.
   Currently, Mr. Demoney said, the airline's load factor is
less than 40% using the DC-8s, compared with 75% for the
smaller, all-first-class 727-200s. The new Boeing 757s
probably will seat about 80 passengers.
