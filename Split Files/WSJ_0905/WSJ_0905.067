   PROPERTY TAXES are on the rise -- but so too may be
revolts.
   Despite widely publicized tax rebellions in the late 1970s
and early 1980s, property revenues jumped in the 1980s,
growing 18.3% in 1987 and 1988 alone. One reason: Soaring
real estate values thrust up property assessments during the
long economic expansion. Also, cutbacks in federal aid to
municipalities forced local governments to increase property
taxes, writes Steven Gold of the Center for the Study of the
States.

   While some experts predict increasing federal budget
pressures will make property tax revenues more important to
states and localities, they also detect the seeds of some new
revolts. Oregon, South Dakota and Colorado all have ballot
initiatives this fall imposing some form of limitations on
property taxes, reports Scott Mackey of the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   The District of Columbia experienced the largest increase
in property taxes in the 1980s; Massachusetts, the biggest
decrease.
                                                                                                       

   HEALTH BENEFITS for an unmarried partner can be excluded
from income.
   But it depends on the state. The IRS, in a private letter
ruling for a city that recently extended its health plan to
so-called non-spouse cohabitants of employees, says the
recipients of such benefits must live in a state that
recognizes common-law marriages. Otherwise, they must fit the
definition of "dependent" under the Internal Revenue Code,
which requires that they receive over half their support from
the employee.
   The ruling "has much wider implications than health
plans," says Mary B. Hevener of the Washington law firm Lee,
Toomey &amp; Kent. A growing number of employers are offering an
array of benefits, such as retail discounts and dependent
care, to people with whom employees live outside of marriage.
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia recognize such
marriages, according to the Georgetown Law Center.
                                                                                                       

   SMALL BUSINESS hails a Rostenkowski tax incentive package.
   A bill recently introduced by the House Ways and Means
chairman gives a $5,000 tax credit for expenses that small
firms incur in providing access for disabled people. "This
was something we'd been working on for a long time," says
D.J. Gribben of the National Federation of Independent
Business, which had opposed the new Americans with
Disabilities Act, saying it would put a big financial burden
on small firms. The chairman's endorsement gives them
powerful support for the tax credit and increases the
likelihood that it will be included in a budget package this
year.
   But some small-business advocates are more reserved about
the bill. "We're not sure how it plays," says Todd McCracken
of National Small Business United, noting that the bill also
lowers to $15,000 from $35,000 a cap on deductions for
removing architectural and transportation barriers to the
disabled. And despite its support, the NFIB still may push
for changes, such as broadening the bill's definition of
small business.
   The bill also would extend permanently a 25% deduction for
health insurance costs of self-employed taxpayers.
                                                                                                       

   NICOTINE ISN'T ADDICTIVE. At least that was the premise of
an 11-year-old IRS ruling declaring that the costs of
stop-smoking programs aren't deductible as a medical expense.
Now, in response to requests that they reconsider in light of
new medical evidence about the effects of nicotine, IRS
officials are taking another look.
                                                                                                       

   TAX SHELTERS continue to dwindle. Largely because of
changes made in the 1986 tax revision law, shelter
registrations plummeted to 2,476 last year from 21,246
between September 1984 and the end of 1985, the Treasury
says. It is even suggesting eliminating a requirement that
shelters must register with the IRS.
                                                                                                       

   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE gather dust at the IRS. A General
Accounting Office study finds that uncollected tax bills
dating back more than one year have grown by $11.2 billion,
to $30.8 billion, between fiscal years 1986 and 1989. Cases
over one year old now comprise 55% of the agency's accounts
receivable, up from 46% in 1986.
                                                                                                       

   PRACTITIONER STANDARDS again engender debate.
   Four years ago the Treasury set off a furor with a
proposal to toughen the rules of conduct governing people who
advise and represent taxpayers before the IRS. One change
would require preparers to advise a taxpayer taking an
aggressive position of the possibility of incurring a
"substantial understatement penalty." Another said preparers
had to disclose an aggressive position on returns. After a
barrage of criticism from practitioners, the Treasury put off
further work on the proposal, waiting for Congress to enact a
penalty reform bill.
   But now that such reform has passed, the IRS has set up a
commissioner's advisory group to review the standards again.
And at a meeting of the group last week, practitioners
presented their own report. For example, they suggested
requiring disclosure of an aggressive position only if
preparers didn't believe there was a "realistic possibility"
of it being sustained.
   The advisory group will review the proposals, says Leslie
Shapiro, IRS director of practice.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Budget negotiators consider a revenue-raising plan
to delay for three to six months the increasing of tax
brackets with inflation. . . . An IRS advisory group member
worries that only half the tax forms sent out are returned;
the rest presumably add to the landfill problem.
