   Amdura Corp. said it received a new bid for its Amdura
National Distribution Co. unit from United Hardware
Distributing Co. that topped an earlier bid from Our Own
Hardware, setting up a possible auction in federal bankruptcy
court.
   Amdura, a Denver automotive and hardware distributor and
specialty manufacturer, declined to release terms of the bids
from the two companies, both of which are dealer-owned
hardware cooperatives based in Minneapolis.

   But an Amdura spokesman said the latest bid topped the
earlier one by at least $1 million, as specified by the
federal bankruptcy-court judge overseeing Amdura's
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
which gives the company protection from creditors. He added
that a hearing on the sale is scheduled for Friday, at which
time interested parties can submit higher bids.
   Amdura National, a wholesale hardware distributor that
serves Trustworthy hardware stores in the upper Midwest, also
is operating under bankruptcy-court protection.
