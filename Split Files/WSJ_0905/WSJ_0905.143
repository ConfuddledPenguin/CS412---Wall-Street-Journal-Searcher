   When Newsweek writer Charles Leerhsen accepted a lucrative
offer to write Donald Trump's second autobiography, he says,
a fellow reporter accused him of "prostituting his talents."
Did Mr. Leerhsen feel at all ambivalent?
   "Not at all," he says. "I felt rich."

   Publishing sources say Mr. Leerhsen received a fee in the
mid six figures, but no royalties. "Trump: Surviving at the
Top," by Mr. Trump "with" Mr. Leerhsen, recently hit the
stores, accompanied by extensive publicity and mostly
scathing reviews. The slender volume, which largely ducks the
issue of Mr. Trump's financial and marital woes, appeared
Sunday on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for
the first time at number five -- and it will be No. 1 on next
Sunday's list.
   The Trump/Leerhsen collaboration is the latest in a
growing list of ghostwritten autobiographies, including a
large number by business leaders. Publishers have been
grinding them out by the shelf full ever since Bantam Books
commissioned William Novak, an underemployed Newton Center,
Mass., free-lancer, to write the admiring "Iacocca: An
Autobiography" in 1984. It sold more copies than any other
nonfiction hardcover in history, except for a few reference
works, Betty Crocker's cookbook and the Bible.
   The demand for ghostwriters immediately shot up. From T.
Boone Pickens to cookie maker Mrs. (Debbi) Fields, from the
Mayflower Madam to Sonny Bono, any name that popped up in the
press merited a memoir. PepsiCo chief executive Roger Enrico
("with" Jesse Kornbluth) regaled readers with tales from the
"trenches of snack-food products management" in his book,
"The Other Guy Blinked: How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars." Drew
Barrymore of "E.T." told her "life story" ("with" Todd Gold)
at age 14.
   In the post-Novak years, ghostwriters have become visible
-- even glittery. They are getting bigger fees and their
names on the dust jacket. Mr. Novak even went on the lecture
circuit with "Confessions of a Ghostwriter."
   "Since Iacocca, it's not only acceptable to be a
collaborator, it's fashionable," says Bantam publicity vice
president Stuart Applebaum, who handled public relations for
"Iacocca." "These are not ghostwriters," he corrects. "These
are second authors."
   Publishers love these authorized products because they can
be turned out quickly and, while they have a short shelf
life, they sell extraordinarily well in a short period of
time. Many readers evidently love the intimate proximity to
their favorite celebrity the ghostwriter brings them: Five of
the '80s top 25 bestsellers were as-told-to autobiographies.
   Some of these works are respectable literary or historical
efforts such as Count Basie's "Good Morning Blues,"
ghostwritten by jazz scholar Albert Murray, or the granddaddy
of the genre, General Motors chief Alfred P. Sloan Jr.'s 1963
classic, "My Years With General Motors," for which
ghostwriter John McDonald spent years in the corporate
archives.
   But critics say most ghostwritten books tend to be poorly
written and self-serving. Many ghostwriters themselves report
that the experience often ranges from unsatisfying to
mortifying.
   "Ghostwriting?" People magazine writer Ken Gross says
wearily when asked about the trade he has plied for many
years. "`Victim' is my favorite title for it."
   "It's like marrying someone you've known for two weeks,"
says former Forbes writer John Merwin, whose literary wedding
to People Express founder Donald Burr dissolved unhappily a
year later, unconsummated by publication.
   Free-lancer Tony Schwartz, author of Mr. Trump's "Art of
the Deal," says the book "put the best face on his story.
There was nothing I wrote that on its face was false. But
there's a lot open to interpretation."
   Mr. Novak painted a heart-warming portrait of Mr. Iacocca
as corporate folk hero. Peter Wyden, author of "The Unknown
Iacocca," an unauthorized and tougher account that didn't
sell nearly as well, says: "I would call Novak's book fairly
incomplete to grossly incomplete." He says the book glossed
over many episodes in the life of the Chrysler chairman and
former Ford president, including his early opposition to air
bags and his involvement in the controversial Ford Pinto.
   Armand Hammer -- Occidental Petroleum's roving
industrialist and stage manager of four authorized life
stories (he's shopping around his fifth) -- said he wanted "a
complete, serious biography" when he commissioned Clay and
Joan Blair, husband-and-wife authors of military histories,
the couple recalls. "He said he had these huge archives. . .
, letters from Lenin and so forth," Mr. Blair says.
   But when the Blairs asked to see the archives, Dr. Hammer
presented them instead with a VCR and 50 videotapes about
Occidental -- "we-open-a-plant-in-West-Virginia types of
things," Mr. Blair recalls. When the Blairs submitted an
outline, Dr. Hammer "allowed as how we can't write any of
that," Mrs. Blair recalls.
   The couple canceled the contract. "We're not PR people,"
Mr. Blair says. (Dr. Hammer declines to comment.)
   Dr. Hammer finally hired Neil Lyndon, a British journalist
who produced a 544-page account, "Hammer," with plenty of
self-congratulatory contents. ("I was personally thanked by
Lenin." "`Well if anybody can do it,' Prince Charles replied,
`Dr. Hammer can.'") Yet the book sidestepped unflattering
episodes in Dr. Hammer's life, such as his guilty plea to
misdemeanors of concealing contributions to Richard Nixon's
campaign (he was later pardoned). The book was a best-seller.
   "A lot of sanitizing went on," Mr. Lyndon says, "which I
very much regret" -- most of it, he adds, at the behest of
Dr. Hammer's friends.
   To prevent Mr. Lyndon himself from saying anything
unsanitary, Dr. Hammer stipulated in their contract that the
writer not speak about him for 10 years without his
permission. "I've never violated it before," Mr. Lyndon says.
   But the more he thought about it, the more he came to view
the gag order as "probably a breach of the constitutional
First Amendment right of speech." Mr. Lyndon also sees Dr.
Hammer's silencing provision as itself "a very telling
indication of his general attitude, which is to be very
fearful of being seen in the world in ways that he doesn't
have control over."
   When bio subjects are honest, they often regret it -- and
by contract, they can usually eat their words. Doug Tompkins,
co-founder of apparel maker Esprit de Corp, quashed his
ghostwriter's first chapter after he found prominently
featured there his endorsement of sexual relationships in the
office. (Mr. Tompkins didn't return phone calls seeking
comment.)
   Esquire writer Elizabeth Kaye tripped over the honesty
problem, too, when attempting to write Peter, Paul &amp; Mary's
memoir, an experience she calls "writer's purgatory."
   When the music trio first hired her in 1986, they wanted a
book about them "as great participants in the great movements
of the '60s," Ms. Kaye says. (The group members, through
their manager, declined to comment.) When she discovered that
their activism added up to one march -- and the group
symbolizing harmony had bitterly splintered by 1970 -- she
suggested they switch from a political to a more personal
memoir. And the three musicians seemed happy to tell all.
   "They used me as a therapist," Ms. Kaye says. "Peter
{Yarrow} told me later that I was so successful as his shrink
that he switched from a male to a female therapist." But when
Mr. Yarrow read his confessions in the finished manuscript --
especially the part about his guilty plea to "indecent
liberties" with a 14-year-old girl -- he "had an absolute
heart attack," Ms. Kaye recalls. He got the other two to take
his side.
   Mary Travers, who had originally sent Ms. Kaye a note that
read "The book is strong and truthful and so are you," was
soon calling the book "too strong and too truthful," Ms. Kaye
says.
   Finally, the writer and group parted ways. "The saddest
part of my story," she says, "is that I learned what I knew
all along" -- a writer has no business "being a megaphone."
   Some ghostwriters say they get little emotional recompense
-- and much grief from their subjects.
   Mr. Trump dressed down his second ghostwriter, Mr.
Leerhsen says, after reading the first chapter. He dialed the
writer's house late on a Sunday night. "You've put words in
my mouth]" Mr. Leerhsen recalls him saying. The magnate was
apparently put out with a quip the writer had added. Mr.
Trump began "freezing me out," Mr. Leerhsen says.
   Mr. Leerhsen wrote the next chapter exactly as instructed.
"I got around to his way," he says. "And ever since then,
it's been great." He was rewarded with invitations to
star-studded parties on the yacht and a business trip to
Brazil, where his hotel suite was stocked with matchbooks
embossed with his name in silver.
   New York Times boxing columnist Phil Berger, the first of
Henny Youngman's two ghostwriters, says that the comic
demanded someone "to stroke him constantly. He wanted someone
who would have lunch with him 83 times a week."
   Henny Youngman complains of Mr. Berger: "He didn't dig me.
He didn't follow me around enough. I gotta get a guy who
laughs at my jokes."
   Well into the writing process, takeover artist T. Boone
Pickens fired free-lancer Joseph Nocera, the second of his
three ghostwriters. "Boone wanted Joe to dedicate every
waking moment to the project," says Warren Vieth, then Mr.
Pickens's communication manager. (Mr. Pickens declines to
comment.)
   Sonny Bono says he fired his first ghostwriter because the
author didn't capture "my humor." Zsa Zsa Gabor insisted that
her life story be told "from the point of view of her dogs,"
recalls Jim Bacon, one of Ms. Gabor's many ex-ghostwriters.
Mr. Bacon told her, "In that case, I bow-wow out."
   (Ms. Gabor says she's glad he quit: "Jim Bacon only wanted
me to talk about how I slept with JFK." Which she says she
didn't.)
   Other subjects are ghost-like themselves -- never
available, or when they are, monosyllabic. Chuck Yeager had
so little to say that his second ghostwriter, Mr. Leerhsen,
had to pad the pages with the retired test pilot's lists of
what to bring on hiking trips: "Plastic Garbage Bags: Many
valuable uses" and "Foot Care: Change socks each day."
   ("I look at things pretty factual," explains Mr. Yeager,
adding: "You'd be surprised how many people wrote in about
those checklists.")
   Comedian Jackie Mason volunteered little time and withheld
much information, including his age, ghostwriter Ken Gross
says: "You had to break him like a spy. I would say `Tell me
about your father' and he would say, `I dunno. Just make it
up.'"
   Mr. Mason's version: "That's a blatant, preposterous
idiotic lie. . . . So I didn't want to tell him my age. What
am I, married to him?"
   Mr. Iacocca granted his ghostwriter only brief
jacket-and-tie meetings in the office, kept his personal
papers to himself and never invited Mr. Novak to his home.
"It was a less intimate experience than I anticipated," Mr.
Novak says.
   When free-lance journalist Tony Schwartz took on Mr.
Trump's first autobiography, he says, "I thought we could sit
down a couple hours a couple times each week and in several
months I'd get what I needed. Except I couldn't get him to
sit down -- ever."
   Every time he tried, the restless Mr. Trump would bark
"Hurry]" or "Let's get it over with]" First, interviews were
forbidden during office hours; then, weekend sessions were
called off. After a while, they were only meeting in transit.
"Most of the interviews were in limos on the way to the
airport," says Mr. Schwartz.
   Says Mr. Trump: "I think he would have liked more time,
but it was what I wanted it to be."
   Mr. Trump took no active role until the manuscript was
completed, Mr. Schwartz says. Then, he made minor changes,
inserting a few paragraphs. Mr. Trump, who says he has
"always had an ability to write," was quoted in the
Manchester Guardian saying, "And I want you to know that I
wrote this book myself." He now says, "I wrote a lot of it. .
. . I dictated it exactly as I wanted."
   Once the books are completed, ghosts often find subjects
are tight-fisted with praise, and profits.
   Mr. Novak received little gratitude from Mr. Iacocca, only
a signed copy of the book with the inscription: "Many thanks
for putting up with me for two years. Without you, it
wouldn't have been much of a book." (Mr. Iacocca declines to
comment.)
   Publishing sources say Mr. Iacocca earned millions of
dollars in royalties, which he donated to a diabetes
foundation. Mr. Novak got no royalty cut, although he did
receive two bonuses from the publisher, amounting to $40,000.
   Mr. Novak has made out well with subsequent lucrative
assignments, including the autobiographies of Nancy Reagan,
Tip O'Neill and "Mayflower Madam" Sydney Biddle Barrows.
   When "Art of the Deal" was done, Mr. Trump threw a
$160,000 promotion party at Trump Tower. He demanded that Mr.
Schwartz pay half, reasoning that the writer should foot part
of the bill, as he was getting part of the royalties. "I
think that's reasonable, don't you?" Mr. Trump says now.
   Mr. Schwartz didn't think so. Eventually Mr. Trump
relented, on the condition that his writer donate a
"substantial percentage" of his book earnings to charity.
   To a reporter, becoming a ghostwriter is a risky ethical
venture that can create at least the appearance of a conflict
of interest. Reporters can find themselves celebrating the
same people they are covering in the press. And a positive
profile can lead to a pleasing book advance.
   In the Aug. 31, 1987, issue of Fortune, staff writer Peter
Petrie helped Thomas Watson Jr. of IBM write a flattering "in
his own words" essay that ran under the headline "The
Greatest Capitalist in History." Immediately after the story
ran, Mr. Petrie got the contract to ghostwrite Mr. Watson's
autobiography, which became a best-seller. "It was only at
the very end of that process that he and I sat down seriously
to talk about writing the book, and I didn't feel at any time
that there was a conflict," says Mr. Petrie.
   About a dozen business reporters from publications
including The Washington Post, Business Week and The Wall
Street Journal got into a three-month competition this summer
for a ghostwriting job for Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
Nearly all the journalists in the running report on the
computer industry; some also report routinely on Microsoft.
Several, in fact, wrote glowing features on Mr. Gates and his
company at the same time they were seeking the job, or
planning to do so.
   Microsoft complicated matters by soliciting writers the
very month of the company's biggest-ever product launch. Mr.
Gates says the timing was coincidental, and the reporters
involved say they avoided any conflict.
   Even when a tycoon subject is a nice guy, the ghostwriter
can wind up a loser.
   When Wall Street Journal reporter Eric Morgenthaler met
his subject, discount-store billionaire Sam Walton, the
legendary founder of Wal-Mart Stores pointed to a framed
motto in his office. "It was something about how the least
important word in business is `I,'" Mr. Morgenthaler recalls.
"I thought, `Oh, he doesn't believe that.'"
   Unfortunately, he did.
   "From the very beginning, he told me he didn't want to do
this book," Mr. Morgenthaler says. "Everybody wanted the book
but Sam."
   Mr. Walton feared he would sound boastful. He "hated the
first person," Mr. Morgenthaler recalls.
   Finally, seven months and three boxes of transcripts
later, Mr. Walton called off the project. A cancer diagnosis
a month earlier ultimately served as the catalyst.
Apologetic, Mr. Walton summoned the ghostwriter to break the
bad news. "Well, my friend," Mr. Morgenthaler recalls him
saying gently, "we've had a good time, haven't we?"
