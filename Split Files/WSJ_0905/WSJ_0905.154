   NEW YORK -- American Express Co. named Harvey Golub, the
president and chief executive officer of its IDS Financial
Services Inc. unit, as vice chairman of the parent company.
   In addition, Michael P. Monaco, senior vice president and
acting chief financial officer of American Express, the
travel and financial services giant, was named executive vice
president and chief financial officer.

   The 51-year-old Mr. Golub was recruited to IDS from the
consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. IDS, a Minneapolis-based
mutual fund, insurance and financial-planning concern, was
purchased by American Express in 1983 for $727 million.
   Mr. Golub also becomes chairman of IDS, a post that has
been vacant, and he will continue as chief executive. The
vice chairman's post at American Express also has been
vacant.
   Jeffrey E. Stiefler, 43, currently IDS's executive vice
president of sales and marketing, was named president of the
unit.
   A spokesman for American Express said yesterday's moves
didn't foreshadow a line of succession to James D. Robinson
III, chairman and chief executive of the parent. Mr.
Robinson, 54, who has been in his position for 13 years, "is
in no hurry to go anywhere," the spokesman said.
   Yesterday's appointments come 16 months after Louis V.
Gerstner resigned as president of American Express to join
RJR Nabisco Inc. Since then, the spokesman said, speculation
about who would succeed Mr. Robinson has increased. The
appointments of Mr. Golub and Mr. Monaco, 42, are part of a
plan "to give the board of directors the maximum number of
choices," the spokesman said.
   "The appointments . . . continue our program to broaden
and develop senior management," Mr. Robinson said in a
statement.
