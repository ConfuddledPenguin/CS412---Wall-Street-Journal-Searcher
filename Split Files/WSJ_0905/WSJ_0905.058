   PETROLEUM PRICES SURGED again, sparked by a jump in
gasoline. Unleaded gas for October delivery climbed 8.34
cents a gallon to 94.52 cents, while October crude gained
$1.80 a barrel to $29.12. In reaction, stocks were mixed and
bond prices fell. Petroleum demand appears to be rising on
fears of a Mideast war, spurring consumers and companies to
purchase supplies now, ahead of potential shortages.
