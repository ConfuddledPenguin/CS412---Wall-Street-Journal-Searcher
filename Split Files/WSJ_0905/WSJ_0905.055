   WASHINGTON -- K mart Corp. and its Taiwanese subsidiary
have agreed to pay a $6 million fine to settle a U.S. Customs
Service complaint that they evaded controls on textile import
quotas in the 1980s, the Customs Service announced.
   Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett described the
settlement as "one of the largest penalties we have ever
collected in a textile case." She said the amount represents
payments for underpaid duties as well as a "mitigated
penalty" negotiated by K mart, the Customs Service and the
Treasury Department. Mrs. Hallett identified the Taiwanese
subsidiary as K mart Taiwan Ltd.

   The Customs Service indicated that it is investigating
other instances of suspected manipulation of textile import
quotas by U.S. merchandising companies and their foreign
suppliers. "This case proceeds from a whole body of work out
there," a Customs investigator said.
   The K mart case arose from allegations that the Troy,
Mich., retail chain between 1982 and 1986 artificially
inflated prices of $24 million in textile goods from Taiwan
and South Korea in order to export more goods under a
"free-quota" system, in which the two Asian governments
provide additional quotas to companies that export
higher-value goods. During the same period, K mart allegedly
understated the value of other textile shipments to the U.S.
to make up for "excess payments," the Customs Service said.
   The Customs Service said this alleged manipulation
deprived the Treasury of more than $2.7 million in import
duties.
   The Customs investigation cast no blame on the Taiwanese
or South Korean authorities. The two countries operate the
free-quota system within the bounds of their bilateral
textile agreements with the U.S.
   A K mart spokesman said the company didn't intend
"wrongful or mistaken activity." He added that the company
has an otherwise "clean record" with the Customs Service.
Further, he said the allegedly violated rules are complex and
easily misunderstood. But he said the agreement by K mart
doesn't admit or deny breaking quota rules.
   A U.S. retail industry spokesman, while declining to
discuss the merits of the Customs investigation, said it
appeared to be strictly a question about duty payments. He
said the alleged manipulation couldn't have increased overall
shipments to the U.S. beyond what the Taiwanese and South
Korean quotas allowed.
