   NEW YORK -- Archibald Cox Jr. was named president and
chief executive officer of First Boston Corp., the latest
reshuffling of top management at the big U.S. brokerage firm
that has recently been stumbling.
   The move was announced yesterday by First Boston's
Swiss-controlled parent, CS First Boston Inc. It was seen on
Wall Street as a blow to CS First Boston's top executive,
John M. Hennessy, removing him from the day-to-day operations
of the brokerage unit.

   However, Mr. Hennessy, who assumed control of New
York-based CS First Boston last year, continues as its
president and chief executive.
   Mr. Cox, 50-year-old son of former Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox and a former international executive of Morgan
Stanley Group Inc., in May came out of retirement from the
investment banking business to join CS First Boston.
   At the same time, the firm yesterday named James R. Maher,
40, a veteran First Boston executive, vice chairman of the
brokerage unit. Both changes are effective tomorrow.
   Hurt by the collapse of the junk-bond market in which it
is a major player, First Boston has seen its once-hefty
profits dry up, and has been slipping in Wall Street's
underwriting rankings. Its CS First Boston parent earned just
$11 million last year.
   Executives inside the firm say that CS First Boston and
Mr. Hennessy have been under increasing pressure to bolster
earnings from the firm's controlling shareholder, CS Holding,
which is also the holding company of big Swiss bank Credit
Suisse.
   With capital of $1.78 billion at the end of 1989, First
Boston is the nation's seventh largest securities firm. It
has been paring back its world-wide staff of 6,000 by a few
hundred people this year.
   Mr. Hennessy's tough management style has upset some
executives at First Boston, and some at the firm say Mr.
Cox's more diplomatic manner will sit better with employees
there. Although Mr. Hennessy still runs CS First Boston, its
Swiss owners are trying to "rally the troops, stabilize
things, bring in a more orderly presentation" at First
Boston, says Perrin Long, senior securities analyst at Lipper
Analytical Securities Corp.
   The elevation of Mr. Cox means that Mr. Hennessy is freed
from various day-to-day responsibilities at the First Boston
brokerage unit. And it puts a strong potential successor next
to him at a time when CS First Boston has been stumbling.
   Mr. Hennessy was unavailable for comment. But in a
statement, he said: "These appointments will allow me to
spend my time running CS First Boston. Now, I will be able to
more effectively coordinate the strengths of our three
operating units. I'll also concentrate on developing new
business and building relationships with our core clients and
investors."
   In an interview, Mr. Cox denied that Mr. Hennessy has lost
any of his authority. "It's wrong to look at it that way," he
said. "For anybody to think that management of an
organization like this is put in the hands of one person is
simply unrealistic."
   Mr. Cox's promotion marks the third major change in top
management at CS First Boston this year. In January, William
E. Mayer was demoted as First Boston Corp.'s president and
chief executive and replaced by Mr. Hennessy. Mr. Mayer was
put in charge of a new merchant-banking subsidiary. In July,
Michael Duval, a senior executive who played a pivotal role
in negotiating First Boston's merger into a Swiss-controlled
unit two years ago, resigned to launch a small investment
banking firm.
   Two and a half years ago, Mr. Cox resigned as a managing
director and head of Morgan Stanley Group's international
operations's London unit, apparently because he saw limited
chances for further advancement at Morgan, where he spent 23
years. At the time, he was one of the best known and
longest-serving figures in the European financial markets.
   The 6-foot-7 New Englander is well known in London, in
part for his unusual habit of commuting on a bicycle. He led
Morgan Stanley's rise to the upper echelons of investment
banks in the Euromarkets. Mr. Cox was chief executive of
Morgan Stanley International, where he launched and ran the
firm's international operations out of London for more than a
decade.
   Mr. Cox joined First Boston this year after a short
retirement. His original assignment was to coordinate CS
First Boston's European operations with its Pacific unit and
its First Boston unit in the U.S.
   Mr. Maher joined First Boston in 1976 and has co-headed
its investment banking department as a managing director
since 1988. Mr. Maher joins William Voute as First Boston
Corp. vice chairman; since 1988, the brokerage unit hasn't
had a chairman post.
   Mr. Cox said one priority for First Boston is beefing up
its technological trading prowess, the sort of innovation
that has helped competitors such as Morgan Stanley. "Firms
have done better than we have in technology," Mr. Cox said,
"and that will be terribly important in this decade."
   He also said First Boston continues to try to pare its
nettlesome temporary "bridge" loans. First Boston currently
has about $700 million in bridge loans to clients, including
nearly half of a $450 million bridge to Ohio Mattress Co. In
March, First Boston sold about half the loan to its Swiss
parent.
   "We're making some progress in {the bridge loan} area,"
Mr. Cox said. "We hope that it wouldn't stay with us for too
long."
