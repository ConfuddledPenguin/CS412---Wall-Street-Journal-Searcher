   From Cobra's Bite

   You reported that many companies are being sued for not
complying with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Resolution Act
("More Companies Bitten by `Cobra' Lawsuits," Law column,
Aug. 2), but that'll never happen to Congress. Just as it has
with 16 other employee-benefit laws, Congress has exempted
itself from Cobra.
   A young man of our acquaintance was employed by a Southern
congressman to supervise his three district offices. In the
summer of 1989 this young man accepted a position in the
private sector just after he and his wife learned that she
had become pregnant. They didn't worry about health-care
costs because he had excellent insurance benefits with his
job and they assumed that he had the same rights as other
American workers under Cobra: His present coverage could be
continued for up to 18 months by his paying the premium
himself.

   But they were wrong] They soon found that Congress had
exempted itself from Cobra. His new employer's insurance,
while a good plan, would not cover the pregnancy because it
was a pre-existing condition. The couple became uninsured for
the pregnancy.
   Recently President Bush signed the widely acclaimed
Americans With Disabilities Act. Any complaints filed against
private employers under that bill can go into federal court
for a fair adjudication. But complaints by congressional
employees will be handled by the House and Senate Ethics
committees. Congress, as America's self-appointed privileged
class, will be both judge and jury for charges against its
members.
   In July. Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) offered an
amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1990 to give
congressional employees the same access to the federal court
system, but the Senate tabled the amendment, 63 to 26. That
vote, noted Sen. Grassley, "makes equal rights an illusion on
Capitol Hill. It will ensure that Congress will never live
under the same law that applies to the rest of America."
   The situation recalls the story of the Kentuckian
testifying before a hostile Senate committee. A senator
asked: "By the way, Col. Smith, are you a real colonel who
earned his rank while serving our country or are you just one
of those `Kentucky colonels'?"
   "You've got me," laughed the witness. "That `colonel' in
front of my name is just like `the honorable' in front of
yours -- it don't mean a damn thing]"
