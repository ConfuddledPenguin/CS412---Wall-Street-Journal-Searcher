   BRYAN MOUND, Texas -- In early May, as Phillips Petroleum
Co. moved a tanker-load of oil into a pipeline near here, a
dock employee scrawled an identifying label: "5-2-90 Basra,"
it said. Iraqi crude.
   Iraq might not be pleased with the disposition of that
shipment, but the U.S. is. Today it sits in a huge
underground cavern here, part of America's 590-million-barrel
insurance policy in a global crisis Iraq brought on.

   U.S. policy makers take comfort in the confidence that if
the crisis worsens and world oil supplies contract, this
Strategic Petroleum Reserve can be summoned at the stroke of
a presidential pen; its crude oil can be quickly and smoothly
distributed, refined and put to use fueling everything from
cars to home furnaces to factories.
   Or at least that's the theory.
   In practice, getting SPR oil into the hands of consumers
would be a formidable challenge. While strategists often talk
of the petroleum reserve as if it could be turned on like a
water tap, the reality is a vast and enormously complex
system. Nobody says the reserve wouldn't work, but the
current crisis is raising a host of practical questions about
how fast and reliably it could deliver.
   Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil, some of it in storage for
13 years, has been withdrawn and sold only once. That was a
10-week, million-barrel test auction begun in late in 1985
conducted under non-stressful conditions. This worries oil
executives such as Leighton Steward, chairman of Louisiana
Land &amp; Exploration Co. "If you had a potential weapon you
could use -- that's what the SPR is, a weapon -- you wouldn't
go to battle with it never tested," he says. Before there's
any turn for the worse in the Persian Gulf, he and others
suggest, maybe the government should tap into the SPR to "get
out the bugs."
   Among the bugs they see are these:
   -- Two-thirds of petroleum-reserve oil is the wrong kind
for many U.S. refineries. It is "sour" crude containing so
much sulfur that if those plants tried to turn it into
gasoline they could be ruined.
   -- Equipment and physical problems have dogged the reserve
since it was hastily set up in the mid-1970s. At one site,
certain pipes have corroded and ruptured. Another $90 million
facility may collapse inward as soon as oil is withdrawn.
   -- If the SPR is opened, anyone with enough money will be
able to buy its oil, including speculators who could hoard
it, defeating the reserve's purpose.
   -- Up to 10% of the oil can be allocated any way the
Energy Department sees fit, a rule that could spur a
political free-for-all.
   -- U.S. law says only American-flag tankers can move the
oil about the country. So heavy drawdowns could mean a
distribution bottleneck.
   Officials of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve express
confidence that they could handle such problems. Although
"it's predictable we'll have some operational difficulties,"
says the reserve's director, John Bartholomew, "the SPR
stands at its highest state of readiness ever." He says it
has been "exercised" more than 25 times in the past decade.
But Randy Suhl, a crude oil analyst for Lyondell
Petrochemical Co. in Houston, says, "The question is whether
they can pump it at the rate they say they can."
   At the moment, officials ranging from Washington
politicians to Middle East oil ministers are debating whether
or when the ocean of oil buried in the SPR ought to be
tapped. The Iraq-Kuwait crisis and world embargo has
sidelined four million barrels of daily oil production, and
while other producers promise to fill most of that gap, the
SPR could eliminate the rest. It could also offset any spot
shortages in the coming heating season, and some experts say
that release of even small amounts of reserve oil would calm
the volatile petroleum markets. But so far the
free-market-oriented Bush administration isn't buying these
arguments.
   The idea of a strategic oil reserve first popped up before
World War I when Winston Churchill converted the British navy
to oil from coal. But he never set one up, and neither did
the U.S. until after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. Congress
authorized the SPR a year later.
   The government began pumping oil into it in 1977, but it
took another oil crunch to spur serious buying. In 1981, with
prices soaring to more than $40 a barrel, SPR purchases hit a
one-year record of 122.5 million barrels. Unfortunately, in
that scramble the government bought a lot of the most
affordable oil, and that of course was the lowest grade.
   Now the SPR is heavy on "sour" crude, which is harder to
process than low-sulfur "sweet." It also yields less per
barrel of the most popular products, such as high-octane
gasoline. In fact, about 40% of the reserve is sour Mexican
crude. Some of that was bought for special reasons; a $1
billion oil purchase in the early '80s was part of a
financial rescue of that country.
   Many large refineries, such as Amoco's huge facility in
Texas City, Texas, can process both sweet and sour crudes.
But others can't: a Marathon Oil refinery in the same city
demands almost exclusively sweet crude. So do numerous other
major oil refineries from Odessa, Texas, to El Dorado, Ark.
Overall, about half the 6.9 million barrel-a-day refining
capacity on the Gulf Coast and 50% of Midwest capacity isn't
suited to sour crude, says Thomas Manning of Purvin &amp; Gertz
Inc., an oil industry consultant.
   "I've only found three crudes {in the SPR} we could even
run," says a worried official of the Indiana Farm Bureau
Cooperative. (The reserve contains eight types of crude in
all.) He fears supply problems for his 21,000 barrel-a-day,
1940-vintage refinery. "The metallurgy of our plant requires
a sweet crude. In a short time {sour crude} would eat up the
plant," he says. The co-op supplies 50% of the fuel used by
Indiana farmers.
   Mr. Bartholomew, the director of the petroleum reserve,
concedes that some refineries can't handle sour crude. But he
notes that many are changing equipment, and also says that
the SPR would never be the only source of oil, even in an
emergency. "Sometimes {refiners} think the SPR should be the
answer for anything," he complains.
   SPR oil is stored in Texas and Louisiana in five giant
salt domes and one abandoned salt mine. A typical cavern is
about 200 feet in diameter and 2,000 feet high, or taller
than the World Trade Center in New York. At the facility here
in Bryan Mound, 50 miles south of Houston, 20 caverns have
been hollowed out of a 10-mile-deep salt formation far below
the marshy surface. Engineers make the caverns by drilling a
hole and pouring in fresh water, thus dissolving some of the
salt, and then repeating the process to enlarge the cavity.
Oil, unlike fresh water, doesn't dissolve the salt walls.
   To retrieve stored oil, fresh water would be pumped in
through a pipe leading to the bottom of the cavern. Then oil,
which is lighter than water, would rise to the top and be
piped away. At Bryan Mound, it could be pumped 46 miles to a
terminal on the Houston Ship Channel or four miles back to
the Phillips docks. Currently, this site, like the rest of
the petroleum reserve, is on "Alert Level Two" and poised to
withdraw oil, says Neil Packard, Department of Energy site
manager. "It works beautifully," he declares.
   Apparently not all SPR sites are in such fine fettle. A
facility in Calcasieu Parish, La., was developed in such a
hurry that its three caverns are too close to each other and
to the edge of the salt dome. The first time water is pumped
in to extract oil is also expected to be the last. Though
officials say the oil will come out, they predict the walls
will collapse behind it. The Energy Department has been
hoping to move the oil elsewhere but can't until 1992.
   In fact, structural integrity is a long-term problem for
most of the other SPR caverns. Every time fresh water is
pumped in, it will dissolve more of their walls, too. By
contrast, commercial salt dome facilities that regularly move
oil in and out use brine, which doesn't eat away the salt
walls. But that is expensive and requires huge brine storage
capacity. While not an impediment to the immediate use of the
SPR, the fact that most caverns can only be emptied about
five times is one reason officials have been reluctant to
conduct a sustained test of the system.
   SPR employees are often waging war on corrosion. At Weeks
Island, La., the government pressed an old salt mine into
service instead of carving out a salt dome. Pumps and other
equipment there are deep in the mine, where salt and flooding
are threats, rather than above ground. A backup system is
planned for 1991.
   At a site in Cameron Parish, La., pipe used to carry off
brine formed as the caverns are created has corroded and
ruptured. The General Accounting Office of Congress contends
these failures "may be the forerunners of similar problems at
other sites."
   The SPR's Mr. Bartholomew, acknowledging the need to
constantly inspect and repair pipes and pumps, says part of
the problem was the "mad rush" to store oil in the early
days. "Pipelines were built and protective measures were made
later," he says. But corrosion is a common problem in the Oil
Patch, he says, and "I'm not aware of any corrosion that will
prevent a full-scale drawdown of the SPR."
   If the U.S. did draw down the oil, who would get it?
Energy Department rules permit anyone -- including traders
and speculators -- to bid for SPR oil so long as they can
demonstrate financial responsibility. That would probably
mean a certified check, a cashier's check or a letter of
credit for 5% of the potential contract amount. The buyer
isn't even required to refine the oil. Says Cambridge Energy
Research Associates: "SPR oil might just go from salt domes
to steel tanks."
   "There is essentially no restriction on buyers," agrees
Mr. Bartholomew. "Our job is to get the oil out." But he
doubts traders would bid if the SPR were tapped. "They can
{buy oil} any day they want to," he says, and storing oil
adds a carrying cost. Any such trader would be "running a
great deal of risk," he says. If speculation did become a
problem, presumably the Energy Department could halt it by
changing the rules.
   Others worry about politicians, not speculators. Under
existing rules, the Energy Department can allocate 10% of SPR
oil any way it wants. This could pit one part of the country
(and its politicians) against another in a scramble for
favors. "It could be a problem," says an Energy Department
spokesman, "given the large number of potential recipients
who all believe in good conscience that they are deserving of
it."
   Bharat Patel, for instance. He is an official of the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and he recently traveled to
Houston from Newark for a briefing on the SPR. People in the
Northeast "are the ones who will suffer the inordinate price
hike" in an oil shortage, he said, asking repeatedly about
the 10% special allocation. He finally concluded that "we
don't know how it works and neither do the feds."
   Pumping the oil and selling it aren't the only challenges;
scheduling and loading tankers and moving crude through an
intertwined pipeline system could prove daunting for oil
buyers. For instance, two oil pipelines initially hooked to
the SPR have since become natural-gas pipelines, making it
more difficult to reach the Midwest and other points north.
And there is no good way to get SPR crude from the Gulf Coast
to the West Coast except for the Panama Canal. "It's a really
complex network of distribution," says Margaret Felts, a
California energy consultant. "You can only move the oil so
fast."
   The 1985 test of the SPR required only two tankers. In an
emergency, most transportation experts say, there might not
be enough qualified ships to transfer oil around the U.S.
Under a 1920s law called the Jones Act, only U.S.-flagged
vessels can operate from one U.S. port to another. Last
winter, that kept some badly needed heating oil from getting
to the Northeast from Gulf Coast refineries.
   The Energy Department says it has an agreement with the
Maritime Administration that oil shippers can obtain waivers
of the Jones Act within 48 hours. The key would be the extent
of SPR use. At 500,000 barrels a day, "there should be enough
U.S.-flagged ships," says an Energy Department official. "At
one million it starts to get fuzzy. . . . At three million
there wouldn't be enough."
   A final question is whether the petroleum reserve, meant
to provide energy security, is itself secure. The GAO has
urged greater vigilance against sabotage, citing a 1987 drill
in which make-believe terrorists damaged or destroyed SPR
power substations, pipeline valves, an emergency operations
center and a bridge. The raiders had easily obtained
blueprints, engineering data and diagrams from a local
university. Worse, defenders took 53 "casualties" -- 50% from
friendly fire.
   SPR officials won't say what safeguards they're adding in
the current confrontation with a nation known for its ties to
terrorism. But their concern with security is evident to a
would-be visitor to the Bryan Mound salt domes, who, after
negotiating an unmarked road, is forced to slow to a crawl
and weave between concrete barriers to get to the gate --
only to be turned away by armed guards.
   So SPR officials are annoyed by criticism such as the
GAO's. In the exercise, the mock terrorists "didn't get
beyond the fence line," boasts Paul Plaisance, an Energy
Department manager in New Orleans. Besides, he complains,
"They used mortar attacks against us. That's World War III.
I'm not sure the SPR should be able to defend against World
War III."
