Treasury said Tuesday.
   This follows an underlying rise of $173 million in July

   Market economists had predicted a rise of $100 million to
$200 million during August.
   The underlying figure excludes official repayments and new
borrowing. Including these transactions, the reserves showed
a rise of $455 million in August, compared with a fall of
$172 million in July and a fall of $423 million in August
1989.
   At the end of August, Britain's reserves of gold, foreign
currency, special drawing rights (SDRs) and European Currency
Units (ECUs) stood at $39.297 billion, up from $38.842
billion in July and down from $43.208 billion in August 1989,
the Treasury said.
