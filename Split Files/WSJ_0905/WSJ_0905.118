   GE Aircraft Engines, a Lynn, Mass., unit of General
Electric Co., said the Italian Ministry of Defense selected
an engine the division co-developed to power new helicopters
for the Italian navy.
   GE Aircraft Engines and its Italian partners, units of
Fiat S.p.A., beat out French and British engine makers for
the bid, the company said. GE Aircraft Engines said it won't
know the contract's value until the Italian government
decides how many helicopters it will order. Once it places a
firm order, 30% of the engines will be produced by GE in
Lynn, and the rest in Alfa Romeo and Fiat facilities in
Italy, the GE unit said.
