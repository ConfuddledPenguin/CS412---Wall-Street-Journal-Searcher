   SAN FRANCISCO -- S.A. Megeath III announced his
resignation from the board of PLM International Inc. after
being stripped of the chairmanship and all other positions
except his directorship.
   In tendering his resignation, Mr. Megeath, 44 years old,
cited "intense" disagreement with the board over the
company's operations, policies and practices. In an
interview, he also complained that he had been kept in the
dark on company activity by management. But he declined to
elaborate on the substance of the dispute. PLM officials
didn't return phone calls.
