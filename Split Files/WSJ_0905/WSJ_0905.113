   PITTSBURGH -- Ailing Equimark Corp. suspended its
third-quarter cash dividend on the bank holding company's
common stock. Equimark had paid four cents a share each
quarter since the second quarter of 1988.
   The move will save Equimark $470,000. The company's chief
financial officer, Michael Jehle, said the board voted
against the cash dividend because of Equimark's earnings
decline. The bank had a $45.2 million first-half loss before
one-time gains.

   The announcement follows Friday's disclosure that the
Tisch family has acquired a 6.8% stake in Equimark. A
spokesman for the Tisch family company, FLF Associates,
declined to comment on the dividend cutback.
   In heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Equimark shares fell 67.5 cents to $5.
   Equimark said it will continue to pay the same dividends
on three series of the company's preferred stock.
