   This week, America gears up to face its stiffest
challenge. Not in the Persian Gulf. America isn't riding off
to face its future in a C-4 or a destroyer or an aircraft
carrier, but in a little yellow bus.
   All across the country this week, kids are heading back to
school. Unfortunately, their schools aren't making the grade.
Two hundred billion dollars a year is spent on them, but one
of three children will drop out before finishing. Maybe
that's why education has become TV's crisis of the week, with
a whole series of academic-related programming, including two
documentaries: "Learning in America: Schools That Work" (PBS,
tonight, 9 p.m. EDT), and "America's Toughest Assignment:
Solving the Education Crisis" (CBS, tomorrow, 9 p.m. EDT).

   Now there are some topics that television people refer to
as MEGO -- My Eyes Glaze Over -- and education is one of
them. Documentaries on schooling elicit the spinach response
from most of us ("maybe it's good for me, but thanks, I'll
pass"). But even if education isn't as sexy as drugs or
crime, what could be more important? After all, kids are the
future.
   When TV first tackled public schooling, the mode was doom
and gloom: Tragedy in the schools] The shame] The horror]
This time around, it's interesting to note that both CBS and
PBS have shifted tactics. Gone is the stern fingerwagging of
the past. Although a third of all high schools still are
flunking, today's documentaries are trying to accentuate the
positive, eliminate the negative. Today, we're treated to
less of "why Johnny can't read" and more of "here's what's
working for Johnny's friends and here's what Johnny could
try."
   Yes, there's still plenty of the old jargon, like
"sharing" and "empowering," and old lines like "learning,
imparted with energy and creativity, can be fun." But now we
get reports that are upbeat, peppy, even heartwarming. Both
PBS's "Learning," hosted by Roger Mudd, and CBS's
"Assignment," hosted by Charles Kuralt, are brimming with new
suggestions.
   "Learning" uses the case-study approach, focusing on four
successful schools, from Manhattan, Kan., to Lowell, Mass.
All of these schools are short on funds, but rich on
enthusiasm. Instructors use pizza-making to teach math --
"How many slices green pepper? how much pepperoni?" -- and
the kids, up to their elbows in mozzarella, are loving it.
More than that, they're learning fractions.
   In Lowell's "microsociety school," part of each school day
is spent in a complex reconstruction of a town, with each
elementary student earning (pretend) money, selling goods,
paying taxes, conducting trials, filling all the roles of
society. Some of the truly precocious are learning newspaper
publishing.
   More than any classwork, more than any curriculum, what
comes through in all these schools is an attitude: A lot is
expected of each child, but a lot is given to them. Most
important is a healthy dose of self-esteem, a frequent shot
of the message, "You can succeed." Correct answers are
applauded, and even when a child is struggling to add up
figures, the teacher praises him for not giving up.
   One incident shows a teacher nailing a little girl in
pigtails for daydreaming, telling her if she's not going to
pay attention, she should stay home. She looks stricken. But
later in the day, when the same student comes through with a
correct answer, the maternal teacher stops the class to say,
"You learned from your mistake . . . that makes you a winner
. . . Thank you for the improvement."
   Where the PBS special relies on case studies, CBS's
"America's Toughest Assignment" is organized more as a white
paper, delineating specific suggestions to improve the public
schools. Host Charles Kuralt grandly calls it "a map that
shows the way out of the education crisis." "Assignment" is
in fact an ambitious nine-point policy proposal. The show is
ambitious in its talent, too. Featuring Mike Wallace, Ed
Bradley, Meredith Vieira, Steve Kroft, Erin Moriarty, Harry
Smith, Paula Zahn and Lesley Stahl, it's "60 Minutes" meets
"48 Hours" meets the little red schoolhouse.
   "Assignment" does come up with some interesting proposals.
Several involve restructuring: Dividing big schools into
smaller subschools; combining grades one through four to let
fast starters and slow starters even out; and replacing the
rigid high school structure -- seven blocks of 45 minutes --
with a more free-form day, including interdisciplinary
topics, and shifting hours. (We're told the standard format
comes from a 19th-century "assemblyline" approach to creating
the model citizen.)
   The CBS special comes off as thorough, well-researched,
and, given the all-star lineup, surprisingly dry. Perhaps
because the networks talk so infrequently about education,
when they do, they tend to pontificate. In fact, in a curious
flip, the network program is more earnest and dull, but
packed with more specific suggestions, while the PBS piece is
livelier, yet vaguer on notions for improvement.
   On several key issues, however, both CBS and PBS are in
perfect agreement. First, the power has to be passed down --
from centralized bureaucracies to individual schools, from
principals to teachers and parents, and even from teachers to
students. The point is not to cram the teacher's knowledge
into the student's head, but to give even the youngest
students skills (learning what an index is, for example), and
let them do the cramming. "It's like they're coaches," says
one kid. "They coach us, but it's up to us to play."
   Of course, in the end, education all comes down to
teachers. CBS states that the average teacher comes from the
bottom half of his or her graduating class, which is a pretty
scary fact. But it just tells us what we knew all along: Here
in the land of the free, teaching doesn't rank too far above
garbage collecting when it comes to status. Better pay for
teachers would be a start, but it's really a question of
attitude.
   And that's the true value of these documentaries. They
remind us that in a country that admires commodities brokers
and lawyers and, yes, even newspaper columnists, there should
be no higher calling than teaching.
