   GENEVA -- Airlines plan to ask their governments for
authority to raise air fares 5% to 8% from Oct. 1 to help
offset higher fuel, insurance and operating costs.
   According to the International Air Transport Association,
which held a three-day conference here last week for some 80
of its 200 member airlines, the carriers agreed to boost
their international tariffs, pending government approvals.
Cargo tariffs will rise 7%.

   Over the weekend some carriers said they didn't know if
they would follow the pack. Others said they would begin
studying their routes to decide whether to apply a uniform
price increase or to vary it between regions.
   Still other carriers, acting independently, already have
raised their prices to cover higher jet kerosense and
insurance costs related to the Persian Gulf hostilities. Now,
some are separately seeking government permission to add
surcharges on flights to the Middle East. War-risk insurance
premiums on aircraft traveling in the region have soared
since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The conference was called because carriers have been
suffering for some time from rising fuel prices, increased
air-traffic control and landing fees and other cost
escalations. The events in the Gulf made the meeting more
timely.
