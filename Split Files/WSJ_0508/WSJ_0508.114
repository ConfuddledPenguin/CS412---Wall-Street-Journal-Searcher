   NCR Corp. said it unveiled a family of high-end personal
computers that are among the first based on Intel Corp.'s new
i486 chip.
   The family includes workstations that operate at 27
million instructions per second and are 32% faster than most
personal computers based on a slower version of the i486
chip, NCR said. The new computers are targeted for such
"computer-intensive" applications as economic and financial
modeling, computer-aided design, graphics and animation, the
Dayton, Ohio-based computer maker added.

   The new computers can use the UNIX, MS OS/2 and DOS
operating systems, NCR said. Prices start at $14,195 for a
desktop personal computer called the PC486/MC33 system.
Prices for a network and database "server" for multiple
users, called the S486/MC33, start at $16,195.
   The new computers will be available in July, NCR said.
