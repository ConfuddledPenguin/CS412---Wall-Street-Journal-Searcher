   MCA Inc., Universal City, Calif., said it withdrew from
its joint venture with Spectacor Management Group to operate
the Los Angeles Coliseum and Sports Arena.
   Philadelphia-based Spectacor, whose majority partners are
the Pritzker and Snider families, said it won't seek to
replace MCA in the venture and will continue to operate the
two sports facilities, home of the Los Angeles Clippers
basketball team and the Los Angeles Raiders football team as
well as teams from the University of Southern California.
MCA/Spectacor has managed the sites since 1988.

   Spectacor is trying to put together a $145 million package
to keep the Raiders in Los Angeles that would involve
privatizing and redeveloping the publicly owned Coliseum.
   Al Teller, chairman of MCA's Music division, said,
"Stadium development, as opposed to management, is not within
our current corporate and strategic goals." The two companies
will continue their association in marketing concert
merchandise.
