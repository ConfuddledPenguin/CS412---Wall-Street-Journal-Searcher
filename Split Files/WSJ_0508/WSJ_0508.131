   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund's
policy-making committee agreed to a 50% increase in the
multilateral institution's resources, officials said.
   The decision, which is likely to take up to two years to
implement, was reached at meetings of the IMF's powerful
Interim Committee late yesterday, according to U.S. and
Argentine officials who attended the sessions. It will raise
the resources of the IMF to about $180 billion from a current
level of about $120 billion.

   Members of the committee also agreed to a U.S.-backed
formula for sorting out close to $4 billion of payments
arrears to the IMF. Under the formula, 11 countries that are
deeply in arrears will be lent further funds by the IMF to
cover their overdue payments but might forfeit gold they
previously pledged to the fund if they fail to honor their
obligations as they work their way out of their difficulties.
   A U.S.-backed proposal to amend the IMF's articles to
allow the organization to suspend member countries that are
severely delinquent on their debts also was accepted by the
committee.
   The committee also agreed that it will next consider the
issue of replenishing the IMF's resources in 1993, a move
requested by several developing nations. The U.S. and other
industrial nations had proposed 1995 for such consideration.
The IMF gathers its resources by requiring its 152 member
nations to subscribe to quotas. In an exchange of assets,
member countries pledge some of their reserves to fulfill
their quotas.
