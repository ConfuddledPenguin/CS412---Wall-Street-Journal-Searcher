   WASHINGTON -- Manufacturing productivity showed a big
improvement in the first quarter, but it wasn't enough to
overcome sharp declines in other sectors of the economy, the
Labor Department said.
   While manufacturing productivity -- output per hour of
work -- jumped at a 4.1% annual rate, overall business
productivity dropped at a 0.5% annual rate, the department
said. When workers in the farm sector are excluded, giving
what many economists view as a better picture of underlying
economic forces, productivity fell at a 1% annual rate.

   Productivity is critical to maintaining the
competitiveness of U.S. companies, to keeping the economy
growing without accelerating inflation, and to raising the
standard of living. If workers produce more per hour,
businesses are able to increase wages without incurring
higher costs. That means they don't have to raise prices,
which would eat up the benefits of the pay increases.
   The report did contain some evidence that wage increases
are slowing, suggesting that some inflationary pressures may
be easing. Hourly compensation rose at a 3.9% annual rate in
the first quarter, far short of the 6% rate in the fourth
quarter and the 5.5% increase for all of 1989. At the same
time, the labor costs of a unit of production grew at a 4.9%
annual rate, trailing the 5.5% annual rate in the fourth
quarter but ahead of the 4.5% increase for all of 1989.
   The increase in hourly pay wasn't nearly enough, however,
to keep workers even with inflation. In fact, they were
making 3.9% less an hour in the first quarter than in the
fourth, after the effects of inflation were removed, the
report said.
   The drop in non-farm productivity reflected an increase in
output at a 2.7% annual rate and a rise in hours worked at a
3.6% annual rate. The jump in manufacturing productivity
stemmed from a 3.2% rate of decline in hours worked,
reflecting the sluggish economy, and a 0.8% rate of growth in
output.
   Lawrence Chimerine, an economic consultant in
Philadelphia, said the new productivity report "reinforces a
fundamental problem in this country -- that we are mired in
slow productivity growth."
   Mr. Chimerine and other economists said manufacturing
productivity probably isn't as good, nor service productivity
as bad, as the latest report suggests.
   Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board in New
York, said it wasn't surprising to see a surge in
manufacturing productivity during a slowing economy. "When
the economy slows down in growth, you wind up with fewer of
the resources in production, both in terms of labor and
capital," he said. "Presumably those people and machines
idled are the least productive."
   To make true, lasting gains in worker productivity, Mr.
Chimerine said, the country must improve its education system
and rate of investment.
   All the numbers in the report were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.
