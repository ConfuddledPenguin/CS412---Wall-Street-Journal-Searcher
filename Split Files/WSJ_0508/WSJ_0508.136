   CALGARY, Alberta -- Amoco Corp.'s Canadian unit said it
retained First Boston Corp. to sell a 5% interest in the
Syncrude Canada Ltd. oil sands plant.
   Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. owns 3.8% of Syncrude, whose
Fort McMurray, Alberta, plant last year produced about
148,000 barrels a day of synthetic crude, or roughly 10% of
Canada's oil output. The Amoco unit manages an additional
1.3% of Syncrude for Encor Inc., a Calgary-based oil and gas
producer.

   Amoco Canada didn't offer a value for its Syncrude stake.
The government of Alberta, which last year offered its 16.7%
stake in Syncrude for sale, said its interest has a book
value of more than 500 million Canadian dollars ($430.1
million).
   Amoco Canada said First Boston has already contacted
several prospective buyers. It didn't elaborate.
   Syncrude is owned by an eight-member consortium led by a
unit of Imperial Oil Ltd., with a 25% stake. Toronto-based
Imperial is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., New York.
