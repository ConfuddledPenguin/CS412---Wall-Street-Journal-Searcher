   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is launching a new
ad campaign aimed at reversing a sales plunge that has
mystified and mortified top executives.
   The ads, which begin today, claim Chrysler models are
superior to Honda Motor Co.'s much-touted Civic and Accord.
The campaign is based on recent tests with 200 car owners in
California, a market dominated by Honda and other imports.

   The targets for the new campaign are customers Chrysler
needs to survive long-term: younger, more affluent buyers who
currently own domestic vehicles but are considering switching
to an import.
   The head-to-head comparisons ("Meet the Americans that
beat the Hondas") are an aggressive, high-stakes gamble for
Chrysler, but it has few other options. The company, which
once seemed able to fend off every sales slump with a new
advertising program or incentive gimmick, has watched its
U.S. car market share dive almost three percentage points in
only four months. This has happened despite some of the
heftiest rebates in Chrysler's history.
   If current trends continue, Chrysler will wind up 1990 in
fifth place in U.S. car sales, behind Honda and Toyota Motor
Corp. as well as General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
Chrysler still leads its Japanese rivals in combined car and
truck sales, thanks to its Jeeps and minivans. But the
company's share of total vehicle sales barely equals its
share of car sales alone in recent years.
   One possible reason for the drop is that Chrysler, over
the past two years, has killed off some 20 nameplates,
including what once were its best-selling cars: the boxy
Omni-Horizon subcompacts and Aries-Reliant compacts. These
and other discontinued cars -- larger, rear-wheel-drive
models including the Dodge Diplomat -- appealed to Chrysler's
historical owner base of older, blue-collar consumers.
   Chrysler may have moved too fast with the cuts, alienating
its traditional buyers, acknowledges Bennett E. Bidwell,
chairman of the auto maker's Chrysler Motors unit. But, he
says: "How do you go from yesterday's lineup . . . to
tomorrow's lineup, and a change in your owner base and your
owner demographics, without some surgery? And surgery always
carries a little pain with it."
   Other factors could be contributing to the dismal sales.
One is possible consumer backlash over Chrysler Chairman Lee
A. Iacocca's controversial "board room" television
commercial, which ran for three weeks in March. In it, an
agitated Mr. Iacocca told a group of Chrysler executives that
consumers don't realize Chrysler and other American auto
makers are building better cars than the Japanese. "And
that's gonna change," he growled at the end.
   Some critics have complained that the ads are just the
latest in what they see as a long history of "Japan-bashing"
by Mr. Iacocca. Others say Chrysler appeared to be blaming
consumers for the auto maker's slow sales.
   But Chrysler has tested consumer reaction to the
commercial. Company officials say that market research, as
well as letters and calls to the company, show no evidence
that consumers have had too much of the outspoken Mr.
Iacocca. In fact, response to the board room ad has been
overwhelmingly positive, said John B. Damoose, vice president
of brand marketing at a news conference yesterday.
   So the new ads again feature Mr. Iacocca, who gives the
results of tests Chrysler commissioned from U.S. Testing Co.
Market Research Inc. of Wheeling, Ill. Two hundred owners of
GM and Ford cars who said "they either definitely or probably
would consider buying a Japanese import" were asked to
compare Chrysler products with those of Honda.
   Eighty-three out of 100 in one group judged Dodge Spirit
and Plymouth Acclaim "superior overall" to the Honda Accord
in styling, comfort, convenience, driving experience and
riding comfort. Seventy-six out of 100 in the second group
ranked Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow ahead of Honda
Civic on the same criteria.
   Chrysler officials acknowledged that the new ads may test
its credibility with some consumers, particularly the
comparisons with the Accord, which was the best-selling car
in the U.S. last year. "I got to tell you, we had no idea we
would win such a test so decisively," said Mr. Damoose. "It
was a shock to all of us."
   Honda declined to comment on the attack. It would be
"inappropriate," said Honda spokesman Kurt Antonius. "We
don't want to say anything until we see the commercial."
   At yesterday's news conference, reporters asked why
Chrysler didn't run the tests with current import owners. Mr.
Damoose replied that Chrysler mainly is aiming to attract
some of the more than 60% of American buyers who still own
domestic cars but who are inclined to buy Japanese the next
time around. He also noted that the tests were run in Los
Angeles, an area with extremely high import sales.
   Chrysler needs a boost from this campaign to offset the
anemic sales of some other vehicles. The auto maker added
several luxury models over the past year, for example, but
its luxury car sales overall are off some 30% from 1989
levels.
   And the Dodge Monaco, a derivation of the slow-selling
Eagle Premier, has proved to be a disaster. Chrysler has sold
only 928 of the cars during the first four months of this
year; at the end of March, dealers had enough Monacos to last
more than 400 days. Premier sales, never robust to begin
with, have bogged down even more this year, with deliveries
through April 30 down more than 60% compared with 1989.
   Chrysler officials point to other factors that have cut
into the auto maker's sales. Chrysler is buying some 50,000
fewer vehicles this year from Mitsubishi Motors Corp., its
Japanese partner, to concentrate on sales of vehicles it
builds itself. Chrysler also has chosen to to drop some fleet
business it believes isn't profitable, cutting sales by an
additional 50,000 to 70,000 vehicles.
   Mr. Bidwell believes Chrysler still can win a 13% share of
all U.S. car and truck sales this year, down from 13.5% in
1989. For the first four months of the year, Chrysler's share
was 12.4%, buoyed by the first-ever rebates on its minivans,
which produced record January sales.
   As Chrysler executives search for solutions to the sales
plunge, the one thing saving the company right now from real
disaster is its six-month-old, $1.5 billion cost-cutting
program. Chrysler executives, criticized for not watching
expenses over the past few years, surprised Wall Street by
running auto operations in the black in the first quarter.
The profit was just $5 million, but that success helped
Chrysler's stock rebound from the six-year low of $14.50 a
share it reached April 30. (In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Chrysler shares closed at
$16.50, up 12.5 cents.)
   But cost-cutting alone won't be enough to get the company
through what promises to be a rough few months -- and
possibly years. Chrysler will lose income later this year
when it closes its two minivan plants for a month to retool
for the 1991 versions. And the company doesn't have any new,
high-volume cars coming until 1992, when it is to introduce a
line of family cars code-named the L/H models.
   Mr. Damoose acknowledged that, even with the marketing
blitz Chrysler plans over the next few months, it will take
time to turn consumer perceptions around. "I think it's going
to be 90 days before you begin to see" any real impact on
sales, he said yesterday. Over the short-term, commercials
featuring such items as air bags, which Chrysler is heavily
promoting, won't "make people run into dealerships . . . but
long-term, they will."
