   HONG KONG -- Overseas Trust Bank, which was declared
insolvent and taken over by the government in 1985, settled a
negligence claim against accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the bank's auditor until the takeover.
   Overseas Trust alleged that Coopers &amp; Lybrand failed to
audit the bank's accounts properly, and therefore should take
at least some responsibility for the losses that caused the
insolvency and subsequent takeover.

   The settlement, announced Monday, involves a payment by
Coopers &amp; Lybrand to the bank, which remains under government
management. The amount of the payment wasn't disclosed.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the world's largest accounting
firms, isn't required to admit liability.
   Overseas Trust Managing Director David Turner said the
bank considers the payment a satisfactory settlement of the
lawsuit, which he described as "basically a negligence
action."
   Roderick Chalmers, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said
the firm continues to maintain its "denial of the
allegations" in the lawsuit as well as its "denial of
liability." In New York, Coopers &amp; Lybrand's in-house lawyers
weren't available for comment.
   After the government takeover, Overseas Trust announced a
consolidated loss totaling HK$3.05 billion (US$391.4
million), for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1985. Subsequent
police investigations led to fraud convictions and prison
terms for several senior bank executives and their business
associates.
   Coopers &amp; Lybrand wasn't implicated in the criminal
investigation.
