   The world sure can't look very bright from where Fidel
Castro sits. He has expanded jamming of Radio Marti to 24
hours a day in Havana, up from six. He is devoting
considerable resources to trying to get TV Marti off the
screens. He is even holding a special militia exercise
featuring such devices as spiked booby traps and Molotov
cocktails to stop the predicted invading Yanqui forces. His
commanders warn that this will be a "war of all the people,"
but Castro might be careful how many weapons get into the
people's hands. If there is fighting, it could also be a war
by all of the people and for all of the people.
