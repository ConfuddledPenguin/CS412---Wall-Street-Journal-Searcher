   BONN -- New orders to the West German manufacturing
industry rose a seasonally adjusted 2.9% in March from
February and were up 3.5% from a year earlier, the Bonn
Economics Ministry said in a preliminary report.
   The rise reflected a sharp 10.5% month-to-month increase
in foreign orders, which resulted from a few large orders
obtained by the nation's aerospace industry, the ministry
said. Domestic orders dropped 1.5% during the month.
