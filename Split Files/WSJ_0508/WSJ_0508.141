   NATO'S CHIEF REJECTED a call by Moscow for a neutral
united Germany. After conferring with Bush in Washington, the
Western alliance's secretary-general, Manfred Woerner, said a
reunified Germany mustn't only stay in NATO but also remain a
base for its nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union has insisted
on Germany neutrality, and Woerner said it appears that
despite weekend negotiations in Bonn over the future of
Germany, the Kremlin hasn't accepted the allies' plan for the
united German state to be a member of NATO.
   Officials in East and West Berlin set a July 2 target date
to eliminate all border controls and provide full free access
between the two sides of the city.

   LATVIA MOVED to assure Gorbachev that Soviet interests
would be respected. As Soviet tanks and other armored
vehicles rumbled through Riga, the Baltic republic's
legislature prepared a letter to the Kremlin leader saying
that despite its declaration of independence Friday, Latvia
would retain "current constitutional norms." The lawmakers,
who chose a new prime minister, also urged "a fruitful
dialogue." Gorbachev, without specifically mentioning Latvia,
said separatists were pursuing "an irresponsible policy
leading to deadlock."
   Lithuania's agriculture minister said the republic
intended to slash supplies of milk and meat to the Soviet
Union in retaliation for Moscow's sanctions.

   The FBI has arrested two Colombians accused of attempting
to purchase Stinger missiles to use against aircraft carrying
Bogota officials. The pair, who had claimed links to
Medellin-based cocaine traffickers, agreed to make a down
payment of $1 million in drug profits for a "substantial
number" of the anti-aircraft missiles.
                                                                                                       

   Colombian soldiers raided jungle drug labs and airstrips,
seizing more than 13 tons of cocaine in a three-day sweep.
The seizure was called the country's biggest ever.
