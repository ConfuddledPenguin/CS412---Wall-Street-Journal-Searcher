   We will do anything to help our country compete out there
in the cold, cruel world except read about it. Whenever our
line of sight intersects reading material entitled "U.S.
Competitiveness in the Changing Global Economy" or anything
close, our eyelids slam shut.
   This, in fact, was exactly what was happening the other
afternoon, and we would have been deep into Z-Land had
someone not dropped on our desk in the nick of time a
quarterly but riveting publication entitled "World's Fair."

   We immediately perked up because world's fairs always
remind us of Elvis. This is because the closest we ever got
to Elvis was at the Seattle World's Fair in the summer of
1962.
   Technically, it was called the Century 21 Exposition, with
exhibits from 48 countries, 9.7 million visitors and a
607-foot Space Needle. It was a Category B, or single-theme,
exposition, and we hitchhiked all the way across the country
with our friend Andy to get to it, carefully plotting our
route west and back so that we might set a record for college
freshmen setting foot in the most states in a single,
thumb-propelled summer expedition.
   Anyway, by the time we got to Seattle, it was late August
and Elvis's tracks were all over the place. He had been there
making a movie called "It Happened at the World's Fair." We
forgot exactly what happened, but we remember what that fair
proved. It proved that the U.S.A. was THE BEST. Castro had
Cuba, but we had Elvis and a Space Needle and we were the
world's Numero Uno.
   The other thing world's fairs remind us of is lying. This
is because the only other world's fair we've visited was Expo
'74 in Spokane, Wash., 289 miles east of Seattle. This was a
mini-fair, with exhibits from 11 nations and 37 corporations,
and a theme of "celebrating tomorrow's fresh, new
environment," which the organizers symbolized by dumping
exactly 1,974 foot-long rainbow trout into the Spokane River,
and which demonstrators saluted with a placard that read,
"Clean Up Our Environment, Impeach Nixon."
   The biggest exhibits in Spokane were from the governments
of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and they lied through their
teeth about pollution. The Soviets said, essentially, that
good socialists don't pollute, and they didn't have any
pollution. The U.S., at least, was honest enough to say it
had some.
   The U.S. pavilion contained, among other things, a huge
pile of junk. Once again, we got the message: The U.S. was
BEST, No. 1, although we admit spending less time near the
junk pile than around the pretty girls at the Philippines
pavilion's chicken adobo concession.
   Anyway, from our experience and study over the years we
have concluded, more or less, that world's fairs are
gatherings at which various nations strut their stuff and
then the good old U.S.A. walks away with the blue ribbon.
That's what happened at the first world's fair, the Crystal
Palace Exhibition of 1851 in London, and at the 1893
Columbian Exposition in Chicago. And on and on. It somehow
didn't seem, well, fair.
   So you can imagine how our eyelids popped open at seeing
World's Fair quarterly's front-page headline: "A Major
Embarrassment in the Making: Congress Refuses Money for US
Pavilion in Seville."
   Seville Expo '92 isn't going to be some rinky-dink
sideshow in the tacky, long-queued manner of financially
burdened Knoxville '82, or stealing-burdened New Orleans '84.
Seville is going to be a HUMONGOUS MOTHER. This is the fair
that celebrates the end of the Cold War, the coronation of
the European Community, the 500th Anniversary of Columbus's
discovery of America, and Spain's emergence as a modern
democracy. The organizers expect 103 nations to build
pavilions and 30 million to 40 million people to visit. The
1992 Summer Olympic Games will be going on in nearby
Barcelona, bikinis will be swarming the beaches at the nearby
Costa del Sol, and a Disneyland is opening in nearby France.
   Seville in the summer of 1992 is going to be the center of
the universe, and the United States of America has the grace,
maturity and generosity to stay home for a change and let
somebody else have the limelight.
   We had to find out why, so we phoned Alfred Heller, the
editor of World's Fair who lives in Corte Madera, Calif.,
which is in Marin County. He's a world's fair hardliner.
   "It all seems inconsequential and almost amusing now," he
told us. "But come 1992, and here is a major world event,
with more nations participating than ever before, during the
year of Europe when, perhaps, a good number of Eastern
Europeans could be traveling to the west for the first time,
and here is THE GREAT DEMOCRACY too preoccupied to
participate. It seems odd that we don't have a sense of our
own worth and importance to put ourselves forward at a great
gathering at a propitious time."
   But hey, we thought, just because we don't play doesn't
mean we've turned into a Couch Potato Country. We aren't
preoccupied, we're just being nice.
   But that's not what Marvin Stone told us. We called him up
in our nearby nation's capital because he is commissioner
general for the U.S. pavilion, which is part of the U.S.
Exhibits Service of the U.S. Information Agency.
   "We're potentially saying that our competitive spirit is
dying," he said, using the dreaded "C" word. He told us that
the seed money keeping the pavilion's architects busy runs
out this month, that the U.S. effort is about four months
behind, that he needs $14.5 million from Congress and an
additional $30 million from private enterprise and the
states, which are hesitant to kick in until Uncle Sam antes.
But Congress won't cough up the dough.
   You wanna know why, don't you? Well, we'll tell you why.
   Laos.
   That's right. Congress got extremely agitated when it
found out a while back that the USIA was stopping Voice of
America broadcasts in Laotian in order to save $2.9 million
to get the U.S. pavilion for Seville started. And we can
understand why. Relations between the U.S. and Laos are far
too sensitive these days for us to be turning off VOA
broadcasts and risk offending Laos. We could see people all
over Laos, people who absolutely cannot live without a daily
fix of Randy Travis and Ricky Skaggs on VOA, getting deeply
offended. Congress could rightly assume it would be flooded
with letters from distraught Laotians, and listeners in five
other languages -- Slovenian, Uzbek, Swahili, Greek and
Turkish -- the USIA also wanted to drop. Congress said no
way.
   Actually it was two courageous and frugal Democrats, Rep.
Neal Smith of Iowa and Sen. Ernest Hollings of South
Carolina, chairmen of the House and Senate subcommittees
responsible for what the world thinks of us, who are standing
up for the Laoses of the world and against those who want the
U.S. to hog all the glory in Seville. It's a lonely job, but
somebody's gotta do it.
