   DALLAS -- Fred Currey, chairman of Greyhound Lines Inc.,
said that the strike-hobbled bus company is "coming back
strong" and that a walkout by the Amalgamated Transit Union
has been effectively defeated. The closely held company is
struggling to stave off bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   "This national institution is being revived, this national
institution will be alive and well for the summer of 1990,"
Mr. Currey said at a news conference at Greyhound
headquarters.

   He said that Greyhound is serving locations that
contributed 98% of its pre-strike revenue and that by
mid-June route frequency would be the same as last year on
all major routes. The executive said the company needs to
achieve about 85% of pre-strike revenue to be profitable. He
said revenue currently is running at between 65% and 75% of
pre-strike levels.
   Because of strike-related first-quarter losses totaling
$55.8 million, Greyhound missed a $5 million April 30 lease
payment and won't make a $9.8 million interest payment May 15
on its 13% senior notes due in 1995. Because of the missed
interest payment, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded its
rating on the senior notes to triple-C-minus from
single-B-minus.
   Hoping to avoid a federal bankruptcy-law filing, the
company is negotiating with creditors and lenders on a major
financial restructuring.
   "We expect and we have received cooperation from all the
parties concerned," Mr. Currey said of those talks. He added
that the company has sufficient cash on hand to continue to
operate its business and to conduct a $4 million summer
advertising campaign. He declined to discuss details.
   The Greyhound chairman described the often violent
two-month-old strike by 9,400 ATU members as "irrelevant"
because, he said, the unit of GLI Holding Co. is close to
having sufficient new drivers and union crossovers -- about
4,000 in all -- to operate its sharply reduced system at or
near capacity during the peak summer travel period.
   Mr. Currey said that Greyhound would continue to negotiate
with the ATU but that even if a new contract is reached, the
company would have jobs for only between 500 and 1,000 of the
approximately 5,800 ATU drivers still on strike.
   "For all practical purposes, this event is effectively
concluded," he said of the walkout.
   Union officials reacted angrily. "They're almost fighting
words," said Jim Cushing-Murray, president of the ATU's Los
Angeles local. "They're almost the kinds of words you would
use if you wanted to provoke drivers' responses."
   Talks between the union and the company were suspended
indefinitely after a weekend bargaining session in which
Greyhound proposed a new contract that called for a four-year
wage freeze. The union, whose members took a 23% pay cut when
a group led by Mr. Currey bought the company in 1986, has
been demanding across-the-board pay increases totaling about
13% over three years.
