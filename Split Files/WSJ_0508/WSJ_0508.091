   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said that
first-quarter net income fell 22% but that operating profit,
exclusive of one-time items, rose 10%.
   The Los Angeles-based oil company -- periodically an
aggressive buyer of its own stock -- also said it repurchased
2.1 million common shares in the first quarter for $232.3
million.

   The repurchases reduced Arco's total stock and stock
equivalents outstanding to 166.2 million shares at March 31,
down 1.2% from 168.3 million at Dec. 31, 1989, and off 5.9%
from 176.6 million shares at Dec. 31, 1988.
   Net fell to $547 million, or $3.28 a share, from $704
million, or $4 a share, a year earlier.
   The latest period included a $323 million, or
$1.94-a-share, gain from a change in accounting for income
taxes, offset in part by charges of $233 million. The charges
included provisions for taxes, anticipated environmental
cleanup costs, and early debt redemption.
   The year-earlier period included a $634 million, or
$3.60-a-share, gain from the sale of stock in a subsidiary,
partly offset by $345 million in charges for future
environmental and other expenses.
   Revenue climbed 6.4% to $4.22 billion from $3.96 billion.
The number of average shares, on which the per-share profit
is calculated, fell to 166.9 million from 176.1 million a
year earlier.
   Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman and chief executive officer,
said operating profit rose to $457 million from $415 million
a year earlier.
   Mr. Cook attributed improved operating results to higher
crude oil prices, higher refined product prices, and to
increased natural gas sales.
