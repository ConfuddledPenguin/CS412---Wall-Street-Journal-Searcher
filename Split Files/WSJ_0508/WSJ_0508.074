   Karl Eller, who built Circle K Corp. into the nation's No.
2 convenience store chain before heavy debt and competition
took it to the brink of collapse, resigned as chairman, chief
executive officer and a director.
   Circle K, based in Phoenix, Ariz., said Robert A. Dearth
Jr., installed by directors as president and chief operating
officer in January, would manage the company with "oversight
from the board of directors acting through William A. Franke,
chairman of the executive committee." Mr. Franke, 53 years
old, led negotiations with Circle K lenders that last month
produced a seven-month moratorium on debt and interest
payments and staved off a filing under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code that the company had said it was
considering.

   During those negotiations, one board member had said Mr.
Eller's departure was likely to be part of any such
agreement.
   The company didn't name a new chief executive to succeed
Mr. Eller, the 62-year-old former builder of media companies
who took the helm at Circle K in 1983. It said Mr. Eller
resigned "to pursue personal business opportunities,"
although it didn't elaborate, and a spokesman said Circle K
and Mr. Eller wouldn't comment further.
   His stepping aside, Mr. Eller said in the Circle K
statement, gives directors "the latitude to establish new
objectives for the future."
   Mr. Dearth, 45, is said by some Circle K directors to have
eclipsed Mr. Eller, with the board's blessing, since coming
on board. Mr. Dearth previously was vice president and chief
administrative officer of United Brands Co., a food concern
controlled by Circle K's controlling shareholder, Cincinnati
investor Carl Lindner.
   The directors have said Eller critics on the board blamed
the chief executive in large part for building Circle K too
fast, taking on an unmanageable debt level and failing to
alert the board of operational problems when they arose.
Several board members, among them outside director John
Harbin, were especially critical of Mr. Eller's retaining of
Steve's Homemade Ice Cream Inc. Chairman Richard Smith as an
unpaid consultant making significant Circle K management
decisions.
   In an interview in March, Mr. Eller conceded that some
board criticism was "rightful," although he generally
defended his own management and said he had always kept the
board informed of Mr. Smith's employment and other matters.
   "I did the best I knew how. Somebody has to be the hero
when you're doing good, and the fall guy when things are
going bad," he said at the time. "I deserve all the credit
and all the woes."
   Mr. Eller, a self-described entrepreneur who has a
graduate school of management and an entrepreneurial center
at the University of Arizona named for him, certainly brought
good times to Circle K in his early years.
   Taking over a 12-state, 1,200-outlet convenience store
operation that dominated the Arizona market but few others,
Mr. Eller began an acquisition binge that helped add 3,500
stores in six years and allowed earnings to skyrocket to a
record $60.4 million for the fiscal year that ended April 30,
1988.
   Critics, however, said management of individual stores
suffered from lack of attention. Competition from stores
operated by oil companies, who could sell gasoline cheaper
than could Circle K, severely hurt both Circle K and
Southland Corp.'s industry leader, 7-Eleven, in recent years.
And debt from Circle K acquisitions swelled to more than $1
billion, from around $40 million when Mr. Eller took over in
1983.
   Losses began cropping up in the past year, and the
company's stock price plunged from a high near $16 a share
last year when the company, for a time, put itself up for
auction. It later took down the for-sale sign when no buyers
stepped forward.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Circle K shares closed at $1.75, up 25 cents.
   While Mr. Eller didn't give details of the personal
business plans he now intends to pursue, he said in the March
interview that he eventually could be interested in joining
the boards of companies in the media industry, which he
describes as his first love.
   Mr. Eller began his career building up an Arizona
outdoor-advertising, broadcasting and publishing company
called Combined Communications Corp., which was merged with
Gannett in the late 1970s. After losing a battle with
Gannett's then-chairman, Allen Neuharth, for the leadership
of that company, Mr. Eller eventually took a job at Columbia
Pictures Industries Inc., where he initiated the talks that
resulted in Coca-Cola Co. purchasing Columbia in the early
1980s.
