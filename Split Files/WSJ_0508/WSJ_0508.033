   Enimont S.p.A. reported 1989 net profit fell 21% to 750
billion lire ($614 million) from pro-forma net earnings of
945 billion lire in 1988. The profit figure was down
significantly from a forecast by former Chairman Lorenzo
Necci in January that the chemical venture, based in Milan,
Italy, would post net profit of 900 billion lire last year.
   Enimont also predicted net profit in 1990 would be around
450 billion lire, down sharply from Mr. Necci's 1988
prediction that the company would post earnings of 1.2
trillion lire in 1990.

   Enimont was formed at the beginning of 1989 by merging the
chemical interests of state energy agency Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi and private chemical group Montedison S.p.A.
   Hailed as a model of public-private cooperation, Enimont's
profitability has been badly damaged by fighting between the
two founders over strategy and investments, analysts agree. A
cyclical downturn in the chemical industry has also kept
pressure on earnings, experts said.
