   DALLAS -- Lomas Financial Corp., admitting that its
real-estate portfolio is far shakier than it had previously
estimated, said it took a $505.5 million special charge in
its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, resulting in a $500
million loss for the period.
   The big financial-services and real-estate concern said
about $286 million of the reserve, or 56%, stems from its
real-estate holdings, while an additional $74 million
reflects a write-down of the company's short-term
construction and development loans.

   Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
move -- which comes atop a similar $253 million special
charge last July -- reflects "the continuing weakening of the
country's real-estate markets" and a "severe" constriction of
loans available to real-estate investors. "Liquidity within
the industry is at one of its lowest points since World War
II," he added.
   Lomas said another $49 million of the total stems from the
estimated cost of completing the company's new mortgage loan
servicing system and related write-offs, while the remaining
$97 million covers, among other things, investments in
discontinued subsidiary operations. The company added that it
also took a "normal" quarterly provision for possible losses
of $7.7 million.
   Analysts were divided on whether even such a massive hit
will be enough to clean up Lomas's tarnished balance sheet.
Some investors have accused the company, which is operating
under federal bankruptcy-court protection from creditors, of
overpaying for certain assets it acquired during an expansion
binge a few years ago, and then exaggerating their true worth
in financial statements.
   Leigh Walzer, an analyst with R.D. Smith &amp; Co., which
trades securities of troubled companies, said the write-off
was "in the right ballpark" and should dispel market concerns
about disparities between the company's book value and market
value.
   But Jay Lustig, an analyst at Drake Capital Securities
Inc., Santa Monica, Calif., disputed Lomas's estimates. "In
my opinion, I think they've got at least another $500 million
to go as far as total asset write-downs," he said.
   Mr. Lustig added that he expects holders of Lomas's
subordinated debt to "probably wind up with something less
than 10 cents on the dollar," and for equity holders to be
wiped out.
   The news, which came out after the close of trading,
didn't affect the price of the company's securities. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lomas stock
closed unchanged at 56.25 cents. Meanwhile, subordinated debt
traded at about 26 cents on the dollar.
   Mr. Hay said that, despite the bad news, "I continue to
believe that we're going to emerge with a viable, profitable
operation" focusing on mortgage loan servicing. He said the
company hopes to complete a reorganization plan in late June.
   In the fiscal third quarter, revenue fell 16% to $67.8
million from $80.7 million. In the year-ago period, the
company reported a net loss of $12.4 million. For the latest
nine months, Lomas reported a net loss of $651.4 million on
revenue of $220.1 million, against net income of $5.7 million
on revenue of $256.8 million a year before.
