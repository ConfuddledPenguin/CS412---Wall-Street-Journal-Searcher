   NEW YORK -- The Conference Board reports that total
help-wanted ad volume fell one point in March, but a rebound
is expected.
   The Help-Wanted Advertising Index, a seasonally adjusted
indicator of hiring plans, fell from 140 in February, to 139,
the lowest point in three months. That figure is 11 points
lower than the year-ago level of 150.

   First-quarter economic activity was strong enough to stop
a further decline. Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board
economist, said growth in the second and third quarters is
expected to be slightly faster.
   Ad volume, measured in 51 major U.S. newspapers, declined
in six of the nine major regions of the country. The West
North Central region recorded the steepest drop -- 11%. And
the East South Central and East North Central regions showed
increases of 4.5% and 2.5% respectively. Mr. Goldstein said,
"Hardest hit areas continued to show improvements, although
at an anxiety-inducing slow pace."
