   SAN FRANCISCO -- In a potentially devastating blow to
proponents of Proposition 103, a hearing officer interpreted
the insurance-overhaul initiative in a way that would
probably kill the prospect of significant refunds to
consumers and considerably limit the authority of California
insurance regulators to keep down future rates.
   Administrative law judge William Fernandez held that
individual insurers needn't comply with a one-time 20%
rollback provision of Proposition 103 if they can show that
the rollback would deprive them of a 13.2% rate of return. He
also recommended limits on certain expenses in computing
returns and that returns be based on a broad measure of a
company's California earnings, rather than on specific
product lines. But the rate is more generous than an 11.2%
rate urged by state insurance regulators and consumer
advocates during recent hearings before the officer, and some
observers believe it will doom rollbacks under the
initiative.

   "Under this decision, it is unlikely that California's
ratepayers would see a dime of the rollbacks to which they
are entitled," said state attorney general John Van de Kamp.
   "Some people thought the possibility of rollbacks was on
life-support prior to this decision. Well, now the judge has
put his foot down on the air hose," said Steve Miller, who is
president of the Insurance Consumer Action Network, a
nonprofit Los Angeles public interest group, as well as a
consultant to the state insurance department. He added of the
officer's findings in general, "It is a much more
business-as-usual approach than we would have liked."
   In addition, the officer rejected consumer-group arguments
that Proposition 103 empowered state authorities to engage in
detailed, public-utility-styled regulation of the industry,
including mandatory ceilings on certain kinds of expenses.
Such caps would generally "result in imposing actuarially
unsound rates throughout the California insurance industry,"
Mr. Fernandez said. He also held that, for future
rate-setting purposes, insurers should be entitled to earn a
rate of return ranging between 11.2% and 19%, again a broader
range than consumer groups and regulators had urged.
   "The judge has recognized that there are many different
ways to set and regulate rates, and that so long as a rate is
economically and actuarially sound, then it should be
approved," said David Balabanian, a San Francisco lawyer for
Fireman's Fund Corp. "He has held that the department has no
authority to second-guess how an insurer operates its
business."
   The findings are merely a recommendation to the state
insurance department, which is to devise final proposed
regulations in the next few months. But some observers said
the findings would be hard to ignore and noted that the
department has had legal trouble when it has reversed
administrative-law findings in other Proposition 103-related
matters.
   "This is a farce. Between this and the decision last week,
it is as if Proposition 103 was never passed," said Harvey
Rosenfield, a Los Angeles consumer activist and organizer of
the initiative's November 1988 campaign drive.
   Last week, a Los Angeles judge invalidated a key state
insurance department regulation issued under Proposition 103
that would have limited the ability of insurers to use
customers' home addresses in figuring rates. Critics have
charged that such "territorial rating" results in unduly high
rates for drivers in congested urban centers as well as
discrimination against the poor and minorities.
   Mr. Fernandez, accepting the arguments of insurers, held
that regulating insurers like public utilities would be
inappropriate because insurers don't have a "natural
monopoly" on the services they provide. Consumer groups had
argued that insurers effectively had such power because state
law requires motorists to purchase coverage.
   The hearing officer did urge that certain expenses,
including political contributions and legal judgments, be
excluded in determining rates, although some insurance
lawyers said they saw an escape hatch through which such
costs might still be included. He also rejected an
insurance-department attempt to impose generalized caps on
expenses and establish broad "efficiency standards," saying
that the initiative didn't give the department such
affirmative power.
   The attempt to divine appropriate rates of returns for
insurers was necessitated by a state supreme court ruling
last year that basically upheld Proposition 103, but held
that it couldn't be implemented in such a way as to deprive
insurers of a "fair and reasonable rate of return," which the
court failed to further define.
   Under state law, the state insurance commissioner has
until mid-August to render a final decision, although most
observers believe she won't wait that long. Some lawyers in
the case expect all issues relating to Proposition 103 to be
set for trial in July, with an appellate court ruling due
roughly around the two-year anniversary of the initiative in
November.
   Mr. Fernandez has been a somewhat controversial figure.
Recently, Mr. Van de Kamp asked that the officer disqualify
himself from the matter because his wife is an insurance
industry lawyer, among other grounds. Yesterday, Mr.
Fernandez dismissed the request to step aside, denying any
conflict and saying that his disqualification at this point
would be "irresponsible," coming after five months of
hearings.
