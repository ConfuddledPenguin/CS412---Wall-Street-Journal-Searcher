   With the growing enthusiasm for investing overseas,
securities investigators report a surge in
international-investment scams.
   "International swindles appear to be the fastest-growing
category of investment fraud that state securities regulators
are now dealing with," says Robert Lam, chairman of the
Pennsylvania Securities Commission.

   Yesterday, Mr. Lam's office made public a cease-and-desist
order it issued last week against an allegedly fraudulent
Paraguayan cattle investment program. Investors were
solicited to purchase "beef shares," with the promise they
would receive U.S. government bonds in an amount equal to the
purchase price of the shares at no additional cost, the
Pennsylvania Securities Commission said in its
cease-and-desist order. According to investigators, investors
never got the beef shares or the bonds.
   The case shows how convoluted an international investment
fraud can be, Mr. Lam says. "The promoters were in Panama,
the cattle farm in Paraguay, the investors' funds went
through Deutsche Bank, and the sales agent was in
Pennsylvania."
   The sales agent, Earl S. Horne, a Pittsburgh restaurant
manager, denies any wrongdoing. "When I found out it wasn't
legal, I quit selling it," he said in an interview yesterday.
   Like traditional investment frauds, international scams
are usually fashioned on legitimate investments -- including
foreign-currency plays, commodities and futures options,
single-country mutual funds and stocks. Typically, the scam
artists make extravagant claims about possible returns and
often use words like "guaranteed": the investments are sold
via advertisements in leading national and local
publications, by financial planners and insurance agents and
by boiler-room brokers.
   "International investments are hot, and con artists have
really picked up on investor interest in investing overseas,
says Scott Stapf, spokesman for the North American Securities
Administrators, a state securities regulators' group.
   Many crooks are counting on the complexities of
international investing to lull otherwise skeptical
investors. "Many people who invest overseas shut down their
critical faculties; they figure it's supposed to be
confusing," says Mr. Stapf.
   Last fall, for example, state securities regulators closed
down Heritage Financial Asset Management of La Jolla, Calif.,
which claimed to offer certificates of deposit from
Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. Advertisements that
appeared in retirement publications said that not only would
investors enjoy high money-market rates offered in those
countries, but they would benefit from favorable
currency-exchange rates that would boost returns to 18% or
more. Further, the ads claimed, the investment was "100%
guaranteed by the U.S. government."
   William McDonald, chief of enforcement at the California
Department of Corporations, says that investors received
phony certificates with the names of major banks, including
Citibank, and periodic "interest" payments, but that little
or none of their money was invested. The founder, Jack
Backer, committed suicide last September, he says.
   In January, regulators shut down Eurogold Exchange Ltd., a
purportedly Swiss-based company with an office in Westlake
Village, Calif., that the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission alleges was offering illegal commodity-options
contracts. The investments were sold by financial planners
and insurance agents as a vehicle for tax-deferred income,
says Dennis O'Keefe, CFTC's assistant director of
enforcement.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, at about the same
time, charged Eurobond Exchange Ltd., purportedly a
subsidiary of Eurogold, with fraud. Eurobond sales literature
described in the SEC's complaint said that investor funds
were to be invested in bonds issued by various countries,
including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain and the U.K.
   The president of Eurogold, Gerald Rogers, was sentenced to
10 years by a California court in March for unrelated
activities, and is currently incarcerated in Colorado
awaiting trial on separate charges. He couldn't be reached
for comment.
   "You have to be doubly prudent with international
investing because the problems of enforcement and civil
actions are much more difficult," says Mr. McDonald of
California's Department of Corporations.
