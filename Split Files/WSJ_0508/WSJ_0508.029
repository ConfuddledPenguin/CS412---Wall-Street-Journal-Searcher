   WARSAW -- Henryk Poddany is anxiously gazing out his
window at a parking lot full of tractors. Where, he wonders,
can he sell 1,500 tractors quickly? Mr. Poddany (pronounced
Poh-DAH-nee) is the managing director of the Foreign Trade
Office for Ursus, the Polish tractor company. Mr. Poddany
knows that understanding the market in the next few months
will be critical to his company's future.
   For 45 years, Ursus sold tractors mainly within the
protected Polish market. On Jan. 1, however, the Polish
government withdrew virtually all protection. It converted
Poland into a free market country with the stroke of a pen.
Ursus, though still state-owned, is suddenly operating on its
own, without subsidies or other government assistance.

   The challenge to Ursus goes beyond the overnight
transition to capitalism; Poland is also suffering from a
drastic recession, the consequence of the rapid shift to
world market prices. The problems Ursus's management faces
are representative of those of every company in the country.
Ursus is carrying $20 million in short-term debt. It had
hoped to finance its debt through sales, but the recession
has depressed revenue. Tractor exports are up 80% over 1989
levels but from a small base. Ursus cannot afford to
refinance through Polish banks because interest rates are
currently 8% a month (down from 35% a month in January). A
bank loan with a grace period is not likely to be available,
nor is the Polish government going to intervene.
   Ursus is hoping to sell its accumulated inventory to a
foreign buyer. The company's stockpile of finished goods and
raw materials is probably worth more than $20 million. "In
the past, we carried large inventory because vendors were
unreliable and interest rates were low," says Stanislaw
Barczewski, the company's deputy director of technical
development. "Since January we've been able to buy most of
our raw materials on short notice. But we were not prepared
to cut the accumulated inventories so quickly."
   Ursus could also sell equity, perhaps through a joint
venture with foreigners -- several Western companies have
already approached Ursus. Alternatively, Ursus could sell
shares domestically. Management and workers alike are
interested in privatizing the company. Privatizing such a
large company, however, would require months, because of the
need to recast financial statements according to world-wide
standards, to value the company and to build a secondary
market for shares in Poland.
   Once management has found the cash to continue operating,
it will have to focus immediately on other problems. The
company has two main possibilities: to focus on making
complete tractors or to emphasize components.
   Mr. Poddany believes that in the domestic market, Ursus
can continue to sell whole tractors. "Our products are
well-suited for this market, and our prices are unbeatable.
Also, we are the only company with any infrastructure in
Poland." But in the near term, Ursus must sell outside
Poland, where people have money to buy its products. And that
may mean selling components, instead of whole tractors:
"Tractor dealers do not buy from many manufacturers and they
rarely change suppliers," Mr. Poddany says. "Because we are
new to the market, foreign dealers might consider us risky,
despite a discount of about 25% relative to imports from
Japan and Korea."
   So Ursus has to sell itself before selling its parts.
"Foreign companies need to know that we have good equipment,
years of manufacturing experience including some exports, and
average wages of 60 cents per hour, including benefits and
payroll taxes," says Aleksander Burnowicz, Ursus's commercial
director. Exports of components are up 300% over last year's
levels.
   Low wages, however, are not enough to make Ursus
competitive. "We don't know our costs by product," says Lech
Kuczmowski, one of the company's systems analysts. "Our
standard costs are obsolete. We've continued many operations
over the years because we couldn't rely on outside vendors in
the communist system. We are sure to be uneconomical in some
areas."
   Financial accounting is probably the weakest functional
area at Ursus. Historical financial statements are almost
irrelevant since they do not contain market prices and they
incorporate large subsidies. Finance personnel have
historically occupied themselves with the management of a
steady and predictable flow of money.
   Ursus might focus its cost-reduction efforts on materials.
Materials account for 70% to 80% of total cost in most Polish
manufacturing companies. Labor and benefits typically
represent less than 10%. Ursus believes it can reduce
material costs through better purchasing, for example by
importing some inputs. Unfortunately, the company does not
have a world-wide supplier list. "How could we have one?"
asks Mr. Kuczmowski. "Until three months ago we had almost no
dollars with which to import."
   Ursus may also be able to use materials more efficiently:
"We inspect raw materials," Mr. Kuczmowski explains, "but
generally we don't send rejects back to the vendors. This
practice is a legacy of the communist era when the most
difficult aspect of manufacturing was getting inputs."
   The prospect of making all these changes quickly is a bit
daunting. Not surprisingly, Ursus management is interested in
collaborating with foreign partners soon. The Ursus parking
lot continues to fill up with tractors intended for the
domestic market. Management has decided it will temporarily
halt production for the domestic market if local sales do not
pick up soon. Only workers producing for export would stay on
the payroll.
   Similar problems confront virtually all of Poland's 8,000
state-owned enterprises. There is an urgent and widespread
need to make business connections outside the East bloc and
to reshape Polish companies accordingly. Finance Minister
Lescek Balcerowicz, in Washington today for talks with the
State Department, is acutely aware of the need for real
restructuring at the factory level. He has made it a top
priority to see that Polish companies learn Western
managerial procedures and get information about prospective
customers, suppliers, and partners outside Poland. The easy
way out -- subsidies and easy credit -- is not regarded as a
solution.
