   Apple Bancorp Inc. said it will give nonpublic information
to Stanley Stahl, if the New York real-estate investor agrees
to a two-year confidentiality and standstill accord.
   Through a spokesman, Mr. Stahl declined to comment on the
announcement, made in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing by the New York parent of Apple Bank for Savings. The
agreement would require that for two years, Mr. Stahl refrain
from buying more Apple shares or making an offer for the
company without approval from the bank's directors.

   Mr. Stahl, who controls 30.6% of Apple, in late March
offered $38 a share, or about $121.6 million, for the rest.
The bank has rejected the bid. Apple also said last week that
it would provide nonpublic data to investors, other than Mr.
Stahl, who have indicated interest in taking over the holding
company.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Apple shares fell 50 cents, to close at $43.75.
