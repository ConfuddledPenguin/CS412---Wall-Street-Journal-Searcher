   NEW YORK -- The dollar slipped further against the mark
yesterday, still hurt by Friday's U.S. employment data. The
mark also benefited from a more positive market assessment of
German reunification.
   Negative reaction to the April jobs report, which the
market interpreted as the death knell for a short-term
tightening of U.S. interest rates, carried the dollar lower
against nearly all other major currencies.

   Sunday's Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers and
central bankers in Washington generally was dismissed by
participants, due to a lack of new initiatives announced by
the G-7 officials.
   The failure of G-7 monetary officials to voice strong
support of the yen added to the yen's weakness, traders said.
G-7 monetary officials reaffirmed that the low value of the
yen is a problem, but declined to take action in support of
the Japanese currency.
   The yen closed marginally higher against the dollar but
lower against the mark and pound.
   At the same time, statements yesterday by Bonn monetary
officials that reunification with East Germany won't
seriously burden West Germany's economy served to reassure
traders.
   "The {West} Germans are now addressing concerns that the
market had about inflation . . . . They've come a long way
since they first began talking about a 1-to-1 conversion
rate" for all East German marks, said Gabriele Schmitt, a
trader at Bank of New York.
   Earlier yesterday, West German central bank President Karl
Otto Poehl said it is "realistic" to assume that
reunification and the plan for replacing the East German
currency with the mark won't intensify inflationary pressures
on the West German economy.
   In the same positive vein, West German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel said the country's capital markets won't be
strained by the restructuring of the East German economy
along Western lines. He added that stability of the mark and
of government finances is assured.
   Mr. Waigel's comments yesterday paralleled those he made
at the weekend G-7 meeting, where monetary officials agreed
that German monetary and economic unification will contribute
to "noninflationary" growth in the global economy.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6558 marks, down from 1.6662 marks late Friday, and at
158.19 yen, down from 158.25 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6685, up from $1.6630 Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 158.10 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 157.80
yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6560 marks.
   A labor settlement announced Friday between employers and
the large IG Metall workers union in the Stuttgart area
bolstered the mark for the second trading day in a row,
participants said. The settlement reduced market worries that
the 2,680,000-member union might launch a nationwide strike,
they said.
   The yen lost ground against most other units amid a lack
of news, especially about any Japanese interest-rate rise,
which the market still deems necessary for the yen to recover
from its doldrums.
   The mark capitalized on the yen's weakness, rising to
95.52 yen late yesterday in New York from 95.02 yen late
Friday. Sterling finished the day at 263.87 yen, up from
263.33 yen.
   While this week's auctions of Treasury debt aren't
expected to move currency markets, Tokyo dealers said demand
for the dollar against the yen may increase when secondary
trading in the new issues gets under way.
   Japanese institutions interested in taking part in the
primary auctions of the debt are seen as having largely
finished making their dollar purchases, according to dealers
in Tokyo.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $371.90 an ounce, up $1. Estimated volume
was a light 1.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $372.30 an ounce.
