   NEW YORK -- Stocks closed higher for the sixth consecutive
session, with technology shares leading the market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11.26 to 2721.62,
a rise of 0.42%. Among the broader averages, Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index added 2.14, or 0.63%, to 340.53, and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite index gained 1.07, or
0.58%, to 186.45.

   Volume totaled 132,760,000 shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, where advancing issues led decliners, 943 to 571.
   Motorola's report yesterday on April orders for
semiconductors and other electronic equipment was greeted
with cheers by analysts, according to the Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. April orders were up sharply
from March, according to analysts who spoke with the company.
A spokesman for the company said that Motorola's
semiconductor business in particular was showing signs of
continued strength. Motorola gained 1 7/8 to 72 1/2 on nearly
one million shares.
   Investors jumped into other technology issues: Digital
Equipment gained 1/2 to 88 1/2 on 1.2 million shares, while
Compaq Computer rose 3/4 to 104 1/2.
   Terry Mogil, technology analyst at Chancellor Capital
Management, said the group may be due for some profit-taking
soon, however. "A good economy or new products can override"
a summer sell-off on technology shares, but it is not clear
that important products or strong economic growth will be
forthcoming, she said.
   John C. Maxwell III, technology analyst at Dillon Read,
said the technology group is benefiting from investors' focus
on earnings growth. "People are looking at the relative
earnings growth in these stocks compared with the S&amp;P 500 and
they look cheap," he said.
   Investors also bought consumer products shares. Procter &amp;
Gamble gained 1 1/2 to 75 and Colgate-Palmolive rose 1 1/8 to
59 1/4. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing rose 1 1/8 to 80.
   The first leg of the Treasury's $30.5 billion refinancing
starts today, and many stock traders think rates could rise a
bit and cause some investors to sell stocks.
   "Breadth has improved but there are only a handful of
stocks that you can make money in," said Jack Solomon,
technical analyst at Bear Stearns. "After six days of run-up,
it's time for a pause."
   Despite the recent broadening of market strength, other
analysts also doubt that big stocks can sustain gains without
an accompanying advance in smaller stocks. Chester Pado,
director of technical research at Jefferies &amp; Co. in Los
Angeles, said it is likely that the industrial average and
other market barometers will fall back in line with the
broader market.
   "The pattern is almost always resolved by the averages
coming down, rather than the bulk of the market moving up,"
Mr. Pado said.
   But Heiko H. Thieme, consulting investment strategist for
Deutsche Bank and portfolio manager of the American Heritage
Fund, is more hopeful.
   If interest rates come down, which he says they should,
the broader market may very well catch up and even propel the
averages higher.
   Many observers hailed last week's report that employment
in April had grown less than expected, signaling some relief
from the inflationary pressures that have kept interest rates
high. The bond market rallied, and the apparent interest rate
relief sent stock prices climbing.
   But Mr. Pado remains unconvinced. There's no resolution
yet "as to whether we still have an inflationary battle on
our hands, or whether rates have peaked here," he said.
   National Semiconductor led the most active list, gaining
1/4 to 7 1/8 on volume of more than two million shares.
   Oil stocks ended mixed along with prices in the crude oil
futures market. Exxon closed unchanged at 46 1/2. Mobil was
up 1/2 to 60 1/4 and Chevron added 1/4 to 67 3/8, while
Texaco dropped 1/4 to 58 3/8. Exxon, along with Mobil and
Chevron, was forced to halt offshore Louisiana crude oil
production in some fields after a Texaco pipeline that serves
the fields was shut down because of a leak.
   Ames Department Stores slid another 3/8, to 2 5/8. Today,
Manhattan's Federal Bankruptcy Court will rule on Ames's
request for interim financing to keep the company operating
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   PepsiCo lost 3/8 to 67 7/8. TW Holdings, one of the
nation's largest food services companies and the largest
franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems, said it was dropping
Pepsi-Cola products from its 465 Hardee's restaurants but
will continue providing Coca-Cola, according to Investor's
Daily. The blow to Pepsi comes days after Burger King dumped
Pepsi for Coke, after more than six years. Coca-Cola Co.
added 1/2 to 78 3/4.
   Symbol Technologies rose 1/4 to 9, adding to Friday's
3/4-point gain. On Friday, the company said a federal court
had upheld Symbol's basic patents on hand-held laser scanners
for reading bar codes. The court ruled that the Japanese unit
of a closely held American concern, Opticon, had infringed on
the patents. Symbol is coming off a 52-week low of 6 5/8.
   General Motors edged up 1/2 to 46 1/4. The company
received a favorable mention from Dean Witter Reynolds mutual
fund manager Paul Vance, who picked GM as his favorite stock.
Meanwhile, GM's Canadian unit said its joint venture with
Japan's Suzuki Motor will double production of its subcompact
passenger cars.
   Rorer Group fell 1 5/8 to 63 1/8. Rhone-Poulenc said it
successfully completed its tender offer for Rorer by
accepting 21.6 million shares for payment on a pro rata basis
at $78 a share. The proration factor is about 51%, Rorer
said.
   Munsingwear eased 1/8 to 1 7/8. A shareholder has filed
suit to block Irwin Jacobs's offer to buy 80% of Munsingwear
for $2 a share.
   Media companies fared well. Time Warner added 5/8 to 94
1/2, Capital Cities/ABC advanced 3 to 562 and CBS gained 1 to
183 3/4.
   IMO Industries surged 2 1/2 to 18. Late Friday, the
company said a federal court had ordered a "substantial"
reduction in the amount of damages claimed against IMO by
Long Island Lighting. Before the order, Lilco's claim for
damages amounted to $271 million.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.60
to 347.33. Volume totaled 11,770,000 shares.
