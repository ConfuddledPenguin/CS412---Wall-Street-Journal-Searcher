   HOBART, Australia -- Australian businessman Edmund
Alexander Rouse, former chairman of the ENT Ltd. media group,
which owns radio stations in California, was jailed for three
years for offering a bribe to a politician.
   Mr. Rouse was also fined 4,000 Australian dollars
(US$3,022) for the bribe offer, which was made to a Tasmanian
state politician.

   Mr. Rouse had pleaded guilty to one charge of offering a
bribe to a politician in June last year, and another count of
improperly using his position as an officer of ENT. He
resigned as chairman of ENT last June, after he was charged
with the bribery offense.
   In sentencing Mr. Rouse, the court said he had tried to
nullify the democratic process by offering A$110,000 to an
Australian Labor Party politician to cross the floor of
Parliament and vote with the Liberal Party on a key issue.
   The move was aimed at saving the Liberal State government,
which was then ruling Tasmania with a minority government,
and to protect Mr. Rouse's business interests.
   In addition to the seven California radio stations, ENT
also owns three Australian television stations and the
Launceston Examiner daily newspaper, and has interests in
motels and cinemas in Australia.
