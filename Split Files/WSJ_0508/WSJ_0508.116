   Tongyang Nylon Co., South Korea's largest nylon maker,
said its plan to issue $50 million of convertible bonds, or
bonds that can be converted into stocks, will be postponed
indefinitely.
   The bonds were to be sold in European capital markets.

   Tongyang is a flagship of Hyosung Business Group. A
company official said the recently poor performance of the
local stock market is partly responsible for the postponement
of the issue. Several South Korean firms are delaying the
issue of equity-related overseas bonds, fearing the bearish
stock market would result in cool acceptance by international
investors.
   Early last week, the local stock market fell to the lowest
level in about 19 months on investors' concerns about a
faltering economy and social and political unrest.
   Share prices have recovered since last Tuesday because of
the government's pledge to support the market. However, the
market's key index is still about 10% down from the beginning
of the year.
