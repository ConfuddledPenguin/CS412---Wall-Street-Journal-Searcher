   SAN FRANCISCO -- AIDS activists angered by federal travel
restrictions are mounting an effective boycott of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS to be held here in June and
calling for demonstrations.
   The politicization of the conference contrasts with the
first such gathering six years ago in Atlanta. With each
year, the epidemic has grown and its social impact has loomed
larger on the conference agenda.

   The trend seems headed toward a climax June 19 with a
battle over the U.S. policy that blocks people infected with
the human immunodeficiency virus from entering the nation
unless they get a waiver from current visa requirements.
   In response to criticism of the policy, the Bush
administration has whittled a series of compromises,
culminating in creation of a special 10-day visas that will
allow foreigners to attend designated conferences without
having to declare on an immigration form whether they are
HIV-positive. The gesture was tepidly received.
   Dana Van Gorder, conference spokesman, says the action may
even exacerbate the problem. "Clearly, no one would choose to
get a 10-day visa unless they were infected," he says;
requesting one becomes an act of self-exposure.
   And it's not only activists who oppose the travel
restrictions. The U.S. policy has been criticized by the
World Health Organization and by the European Parliament,
which urged the conference be moved to a country that doesn't
discriminate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, noting
that AIDS isn't casually transmitted, proposed a broad change
in immigration policy, removing AIDS and other sex and
bloodborne ailments from the restricted list.
   The administration contends that because Congress added
AIDS to the contagious disease list, it's up to Congress to
take it off.
   More than 85 groups now plan to boycott the conference,
including the International Red Cross, International Planned
Parenthood, the government of Switzerland, the French
Ministry of Health, the state of Hawaii, the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, and the Gay Men's Health Crisis of New
York City. The first scientist to isolate the virus, Luc
Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, has hinted he
may stay away in protest. So far there are 6,000 registered
participants -- less than half the attendance of last year's
conference in Montreal.
   "We'd love to go and make a presentation, but morally we
can't," says Robert Bray, spokesman for the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force. He predicts "a showdown" by WHO over the
administration's policy, as well as "confrontations at the
conference steps."
   He questions the president's refusal to attend a meeting
traditionally opened by heads of state. "The first person to
boycott the Sixth International AIDS Conference was George
Bush. If he can go to Medellin, amid violent drug cartels,
why can he not come to San Francisco?"
   Martin Delaney, the head of San Francisco-based Project
Inform, plans to attend the meeting to give a speech, but
proposes demonstrations. "I'm urging civil disobediance at
ports of entry, to shut down customs at Kennedy Airport and
San Francisco International airport," he says.
   Conference organizers say they're trying to locate space
near Moscone Center, the conference site, where demonstrators
could be isolated to prevent them from blocking traffic.
   "Moscone Center will be a miniversion of a police state,"
predicts Larry Kramer, a New York playwright and a founder of
the activist group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. In an
editorial entitled "A Call to Riot" that was syndicated in
gay newspapers around the country, Mr. Kramer has called for
major disruptions at the meeting.
   Mr. Kramer acknowledges that the article was "hyperbolic."
But in an interview he said, "It hurts me to say I think the
time for violence has now arrived." He adds: "I don't
personally think I'm the guy with the guts to do it, but I'd
like to see an AIDS terrorist army, like the Irgun which led
to the state of Israel."
   ACT UP officially repudiates such talk. "Our policy is
nonviolent, peaceful demonstrations. We may be noisy, but we
won't throw things or push people," says a spokesman Alan
Beck. "We may stage sit-ins to stop proceedings, but we'll
have nothing to do with {rioting}."
   Violence is shunned by almost every other AIDS
organization. "Our group upholds principles of nonviolence
put forward by Martin Luther King Jr.," says Mr. Bray of the
task force. Moreover, he adds, "Violence isn't pragmatic. We
decry it."
   "Riot would be unfortunate," says Jean McGuire, executive
director of the AIDS Action Counsel, a Washington-based
lobbying group. "I believe the past combination of street
theater, juxtaposed with quiet lobbying behind the scenes has
been a help. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. But anger
only goes so far."
   Paul Volberding, a San Francisco AIDS researcher and
conference organizer, predicts, "The conference is going to
be a good one. It's not a convention, but a scientific
conference, with new material to convey."
   "Those who disrupt the proceedings are doing the world of
AIDS a disservice," he says. "It would be hard to understand
if the groups claiming to represent people with AIDS didn't
allow the exchange of information. They should want to hear
it too. It could save lives."
   June Osborne, head of the National Commission on AIDS and
dean of the University of Michigan's School of Public Health,
is lobbying for an end to travel restrictions. Dr. Osborne
says she holds out hope for a bill introduced by Rep. Roy
Rowland (D., Ga.) removing AIDS from the list of diseases
barring entry to the U.S.
   "I understand the frustration," she says. "Science doesn't
just mean those people with research grants. Progress demands
a blending of traditional voices, with those of people with
with HIV disease."
   However, Dr. Osborne declares it is "incongruous to attack
a scientific meeting" over a policy set by bureaucrats. "It's
awful to see the anguish of {conference organizers} that
their meeting could be desecrated."
