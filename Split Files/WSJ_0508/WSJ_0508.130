   Della Femina McNamee WCRS's French parent is negotiating
with three midsized U.S. shops in a bid to expand its U.S.
empire.
   Jerry Della Femina, Della Femina McNamee's garrulous
chairman, confirmed the discussions and said all three
agencies bill in the $250 million to $350 million range. He
declined to identify them but said all are based in New York
and Della Femina's French parent, Eurocom, might buy as many
as two of them. The agencies would become part of Eurocom
WCRS Della Femina Ball, or EWDB, the Eurocom unit that owns
Della Femina.

   Eurocom last year bought 60% of EWDB from WCRS Group in
the U.K., which retains a 40% stake. Industry executives
believe Eurocom ultimately will try to buy 100% of the agency
group. Eurocom executives couldn't be reached.
   Some industry executives questioned whether Eurocom would
have the resources to pursue agencies in the $250 million to
$350 million range. Its most recent approaches have been on a
smaller scale, such as discussions, since ended, to buy Los
Angeles-based Keye/Donna/Pearlstein's tiny New York office.
   Mr. Della Femina, though, said Eurocom was intent on
expanding its agencies through both internal growth and
acquisitions. He recalled a recent speech he gave in France
in which he brashly proclaimed that EWDB would become one of
the top five agencies in the world within three years. After
the speech, Eurocom's top executive, Alain de Pouzilhac,
"corrected me. He said you're wrong -- we're going to be in
the top three."
   Mr. Della Femina's agency could use a billings boost from
acquisitions right now. Its New York office has won some
accounts this year, including business from Ramada Inns and
Schering-Plough. But the merger of its Boston office with
sister agency HBM/Creamer was rocky, culminating with the
defection of the $22 million Parker Bros. toy account. Mr.
Della Femina said that, depending on which agency is
acquired, it would either become a division of Della Femina
or remain independent under the EWDB umbrella.
   Eurocom's shopping spree comes at a particularly
acquisitive time for French ad agencies. British agencies,
long the acquisition champions, dropped the ball in the past
year. They've fallen out of favor with British investors in
the wake of severe financial problems at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi,
and their low stock prices have made raising money for
acquisitions all but impossible. The French, on the other
hand, are riding high in their home territory, making raising
funds that much easier.
   "It's their turn," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with
PaineWebber. Added Mr. Della Femina: "It's definitely the
beginning of the French period of advertising. The French
star is rising in this business, and the British star is
starting to descend."
   Just last month, French agency group Boulet Dru Dupuy
Petit agreed to buy 40% of ad agency Wells, Rich, Greene,
whose clients include IBM and Hertz. In recent years,
Publicis, another French ad agency, forged an alliance with
Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications. And Eurocom itself has
been on the prowl, and not just in the U.S. Aside from buying
London-based WCRS's ad operations, it has been rumored in
recent months to be acquiring a stake in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
   It wasn't clear which agencies Eurocom has contacted here.
Several midsized shops said they hadn't been approached,
including Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss; Griffin
Bacal; Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor; and Korey, Kay &amp;
Partners. Frank Ginsberg, president of Avrett, Free &amp;
Ginsberg, said Eurocom approached his agency several years
ago but not recently.
   In any case, Eurocom clearly isn't the only French agency
scouting around on these shores in an attempt to become an
international presence. "There are so many American companies
interested in the European market today, and vice versa,"
said Kenneth Olshan, chairman of Wells, Rich, Greene, which
just forged the link with France's BDDP. He added, "The
French have very quickly realized the importance of the EEC
and have taken the lead in viewing themselves as a European
agency, not a French agency. BDDP has done that, and some of
the others are too."
                                                                                                       

   Bill of Rights Bicentennial
                                                                                                       

   Philip Morris Cos. today introduces "Phase II" of its ad
campaign celebrating the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights.
   The New York-based food and tobacco giant kicked off the
campaign late last year with TV and print ads touting themes
of liberty and freedom of expression. Although criticized by
anti-smoking activists as disguised tobacco advertising, the
campaign isn't designed to have any special appeal for
smokers, Philip Morris says.
   With "Phase II," Philip Morris has cast famous Americans
in print ads sharing their modern-day thoughts about the Bill
of Rights. Ads feature actor Charlton Heston, choreographer
Judith Jamison and Benjamin L. Hooks, executive vice
president of the NAACP, among others.
   The print campaign, like the earlier TV ads, was created
by WPP Group agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Ads will appear in
newspapers and magazines.

   EARNINGS: Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications, Chicago,
reported first-quarter net income fell 41% to $1.34 million,
or 13 cents a share, from $2.3 million, or 23 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period. Revenue dropped 7% to $72.2
million from $77.3 million in the first quarter of 1989.
Foote Cone said net was off in part because of lower income
from U.S. operations and interest expense relating to its
alliance with France's Publicis. The revenue drop, it said,
was due to the sale of its Golin/Harris public-relations
subsidiary.

of JWT West, the arm that directs J. Walter Thompson's Los
Angeles and San Francisco operations. Mr. Lane was previously
co-executive creative director at the agency's New York
office. Jim Agnew, executive vice president and general
manager of Thompson's Los Angeles office, yesterday denied
industry reports that he plans to the leave the agency.
Thompson is a unit of WPP.
