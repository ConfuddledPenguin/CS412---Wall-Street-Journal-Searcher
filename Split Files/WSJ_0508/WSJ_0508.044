   Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia -- "On your left, ladies and
gentlemen, is the prison where we hung the Australians," the
tour guide told us over a crackly microphone on the tour bus.
   In Malaysia, a country famous for putting foreigners to
death for drug-trafficking offenses, it is the year of the
tourist.

   Malaysians, at the prime minister's request, are taking
extremely seriously their "responsibility" to be polite to
guests.
   The country's tenacious strongman, Mahathir Mohamad (who
has called Vietnamese asylum-seekers "scum"), wants the red
carpet rolled out for legal, paying guests in an attempt to
emulate neighboring Thailand's successful Visit Thailand
campaign three years ago.
   Malaysia's international campaign aims to attract 4.2
million visitors, most of whom have never heard of the
country. Its local campaign focuses on the proper etiquette
for entertaining foreigners.
   In typical Malay fashion, the domestic campaign is
straightforward and guileless. Television advertisements and
billboards urge citizens to open their homes, say "thank
you," promote cleanliness and smile.
   When the domestic airline recently overbooked a flight to
Australia, the stranded passengers were put up in private
homes. Local newspapers ran page-one photos of tired tourists
perched on the edge of living room sofas with their smiling
hosts.
   An American pauses to admire a typical store-front altar,
and within seconds an older Malaysian man hobbles up and
begins explaining local customs.
   It's charming, but all this gushing over tourists can go
too far. A newspaper article complains about "unsightly"
homeless people and beggars whose presence may offend
tourists. But some tourists are more offended by the efforts
to sanitize the "tourist areas."
   "It's a lovely country," says Jonathan Miller, an American
visitor. "But I feel guilty when I read an article like that;
it's too much."
   "Malaysia's biggest problem is its image. It has none,"
says Martin Prey, a tourism consultant with Peat Marwick.
   Mr. Prey and other tourism experts say Malaysia has great
potential as a tourist destination. Although it lacks the
dramatic allure of some of its neighbors, it has a simple
beauty of its own: miles of white sand beaches and unspoiled
jungle; clean hotels; pleasant people; and delicious Malay,
Chinese and Indian cuisine. English is widely spoken, and
service facilities such as banks, taxis and the telephone
system are well-maintained and efficient.
   Malaysia is well-positioned between Singapore and
Thailand, two of Southeast Asia's most-visited destinations.
The December coup attempt in the Philippines, which trapped
hundreds of guests in their hotels and closed the airport for
days, could benefit Malaysia.
   The country's self-conscious promotion focusing on
"exotic" Malaysia doesn't reflect the country's strongest
selling points: It is a pleasant and gracious developing
country where travel is cheap and comparatively
annoyance-free.
   Granted independence from the British in 1957, Malaysia
has followed a moderately insular policy concerned with
maintaining racial harmony among Malays, Chinese and Indians,
and industrialization aimed at broadening a prime commodity
export-based economy.
   Although there is racial tension, the three communities
live together in peace, albeit without a great deal of
integration. As for the second goal: The export of electronic
components now outpaces the export of oil.
   Tourism, however is a relatively new concept.
   "For a long time there was no political will to develop
the industry," says Malaysia's current Minister of Culture
and Tourism, Sabbaruddin Chik. He says the recognition of
tourism as one of the biggest industries in the world
prompted the government to establish his ministry just three
years ago. Since 1987, the number of hotel rooms in the
country has been expanded, resorts have been built and
transportation systems improved.
   Tourist arrivals are up, and many visitors comment on the
sincerity and courtesy of the Malaysians. But not all
Malaysians are noticing the economic windfalls of tourism. In
fact, the man on the street may see the opposite.
   "I'd like to invite you to my home," said a friendly man
selling post cards. "But I served dinner to some American
tourists who were looking for a restaurant last night, and
I'm broke today."
