   MADRID -- Spanish state-industry official Miguel Aguilo is
expected to be named soon as chairman of Iberia, Spain's
national air carrier.
   Company officials confirmed that Iberia's current
chairman, Narcis Andreu, will leave shortly to become
chairman of the Belgian subsidiary of state-controlled Banco
Exterior de Espana.

   Sources at Instituto Nacional de Industria, or INI, the
state holding company that owns Iberia, said Mr. Aguilo is
expected to be appointed to the Iberia post later this month.
The changeover is expected to take place after an Iberia
shareholders' meeting in June.
   Mr. Aguilo, 45 years old, has run INI's shipbuilding
division for the past three years, boosting orders
substantially and helping to cut the division's losses to 23
billion pesetas ($220 million) last year, a 25% narrowing
from 1988.
   Known as a competent manager with a gift for teamwork, Mr.
Aguilo is close to Spain's ruling Socialist Party. Before
joining INI, he held various posts in enterprises run by the
Madrid regional government, including the chairmanship of the
Madrid water company, Canal de Isabel II.
   At Iberia, he will have to tackle the challenges posed by
increased competition in Europe's aviation market at a time
of weakening demand for tourist flights to Spain.
