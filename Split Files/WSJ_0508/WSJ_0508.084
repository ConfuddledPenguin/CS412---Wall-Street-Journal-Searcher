   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. said it will
develop a future version of its best-selling 1-2-3
spreadsheet to run with Microsoft Corp.'s next version of
Windows.
   Analysts viewed the announcement as acknowledgment by
Lotus that the Windows program of archrival Microsoft is
becoming popular with customers. "It's a concession by Lotus
that the groundswell for Windows is pretty strong," said
David Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.

   Lotus had previously downplayed the role of Windows, a
program that allows many different programs to work together
in a single computer and share some features such as
pull-down menus of instructions. But Microsoft is expected to
unveil its next version, Windows 3.0, on May 22 in New York
and many customers who have seen the product are raving about
its power. Windows has a graphical user interface, like Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, that includes icons and
overlapping windows to make the computer easier to use.
   Lotus also introduced a new version of its existing 1-2-3
Release 3.0 product called Release 3.1 that provides improved
capabilities for printing out spreadsheets and also offers
many graphics features. The new version, which will be
available in the third quarter, will work with Windows, but
won't take advantage of all of Windows' capabilities.
   Frank Ingari, a Lotus vice president, said that the
decision to add the Windows version sometime in the future
reflected requests from Lotus customers. However, he
predicted that Release 3.1 will become the standard product
for users who want advanced spreadsheet capabilities.
   Analysts were impressed with the printing and graphics
technology of Lotus's new Release 3.1. Lotus acquired it from
Aleph 2, a Paris software developer. Terms weren't disclosed.
"My guess is that Lotus users will adore this product," said
Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, a Watertown, Mass.,
newsletter.
   However, "I see the market being a little confused," by
all the different 1-2-3 products, said Richard Sherlund, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs. And Robert Therrien of
PaineWebber Inc. said that "there's so much hype surrounding
the productivity gains from using Windows that this will be
greeted by a lot of people as ho hum."
   Analysts said that Release 3.1 should sell better than its
predecessor, the long-awaited Release 3.0 that went on sale
last June. Partly due to its limited printing capabilities,
Release 3.0 has accounted for only about 25% of Lotus 1-2-3
sales since then. Release 2.2, a more limited version that
has better printing ability, costs $100 less and is usable on
smaller personal computers, has been Lotus's big seller since
last summer.
   Release 3.1, like Release 3.0, will sell for $595.
Existing Release 3.0 users can upgrade for $35.
