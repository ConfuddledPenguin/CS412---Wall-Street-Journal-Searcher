   A partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder of La
Jolla, Calif., said it notified Pic 'N' Save Corp. of its
intention to nominate four candidates to the company's
seven-member board at its annual meeting June 20.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Girard Partners L.P. said its nominees include Mr.
Batchelder, Robert J. McNulty, Arthur B. Laffer and James J.
Zehentbauer. Girard holds a 6.6% stake in the company. Pic
'N' Save, a discount retailer based in Dominguez, Calif.,
declined to comment.

   Previously, Girard said it was seeking to reduce the
company's board to five from seven members, with three of
them being Girard appointees. Girard also has said it is
seeking access to the company's nonpublic financial and other
information to make a bid to acquire the company.
