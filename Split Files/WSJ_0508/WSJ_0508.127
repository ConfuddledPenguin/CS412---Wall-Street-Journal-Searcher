   New Line Cinema Corp. reported it swung to a profit in the
first quarter, helped by the release of two motion pictures,
"House Party" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
   New Line, a New York-based independent producer and
distributor of movies, earned $739,000, or 11 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $287,000, or four cents a share,
a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled to $29 million from
$11.1 million.

   New Line credited the results to the first 23 days of
"House Party," which opened March 9; and the first two days
of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," which opened on March 30.
To date, "House Party" has grossed more than $22 million, and
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" has grossed more than $100
million.
   New Line expects the bulk of theatrical distribution
revenue for the Turtles movie to be recorded in the second
quarter. The company expects both movies to provide
additional revenue as they are released in ancillary markets.
   In trading on the American Stock Exchange, New Line closed
Monday at $10.375, up 25 cents.
