   CHICAGO -- Robert Mosky had a bad habit while working as a
futures trader in the Swiss franc pit at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange: He liked to boast about his big trades.
   While not a crime itself, that flaw may land Mr. Mosky in
jail. His bravado was secretly tape-recorded by an undercover
federal agent posing as a futures trader in 1988. And some of
it allegedly is incriminating.

   The tapes will be a central feature in the first trial in
the government's broad probe of the Chicago futures pits. The
trial is scheduled to begin today in federal court here.
   The government charges that the 34-year-old Mr. Mosky and
two other traders, Danny Scheck and David Zatz, "regularly"
stole thousands of dollars worth of customer trading profits
in the Merc's Swiss franc futures trading pit.
   This trial will provide the first detailed look at the
government's top-secret sting operation in the trading pits
of the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. It may also
hasten calls for reform of futures trading regulations if, as
expected, prosecutors paint a picture of dishonest traders
rarely being detected or punished by the exchanges.
   "If the government allegations are true and the tapes are
representative of exchange activity, we have a serious
problem" with futures industry regulation, said G. Robert
Blakey, a University of Notre Dame law professor.
   Following a two-year undercover operation on the floors of
Chicago's free-wheeling markets, the government last year
charged 47 traders and a clerk with a variety of infractions
that allegedly looted profits from their customers. Two more
trials of indicted traders, one group from the Merc's
Japanese yen futures trading pit and another from the Board
of Trade's soybean futures pit, are scheduled for September.
   For the embattled futures industry, Mr. Mosky's trial
comes at a bad time. Guilty verdicts would provide
high-powered ammunition for the futures industry's Washington
critics, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and
Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, who in recent months have advocated steps that
would tighten regulation of the futures markets.
   Says Congressman Edward Markey (D., Mass.), an advocate of
financial market reform: "To the extent that these trials
graphically portray the failures in the surveillance and
enforcement record of our regulators, the need for the
strongest possible unified regulatory scheme will be
reinforced."
   The futures exchanges say that the indicted traders
represent only a small fraction of the few thousand members
of each exchange who collectively make millions of legitimate
trades each year. The exchanges also toughened certain
trading rules following the indictments.
   Defense attorneys for the traders contend their clients
are innocent, and that the indictments reflect the
government's ignorance of the inner workings of the futures
markets. The attorneys say they will argue that the
government's undercover agent often didn't understand what
was going on in the frenetic atmosphere of the trading pit.
The attorneys also are likely to assert that many of the
allegedly fraudulent trades are examples of widespread -- and
unpunished -- bending of exchange rules practiced by traders
in most Merc pits to help each other execute orders in the
often frantic trading atmosphere.
   But that may be a difficult sell. If, as the government
alleges, "brokers were avoiding liability for errors by
getting another trader to bail them out, and they were taking
money away from customers, that falls within the traditional
ballpark of fraud," says John Coffee, a Columbia University
law professor.
   The first trial is critical because the government would
like to use a guilty verdict to pressure other traders it has
indicted. These traders could then provide evidence against
still others to garner more guilty verdicts.
   There is continued pressure on the government to broaden
its case and win more indictments. Grand jury indictments
against 48 individuals doesn't justify a probe of the trading
pits that cost millions of dollars and already has done
substantial damage to the reputation of the exchanges and
their members, critics of the investigation claim.
   Sixteen individuals, including two Swiss franc traders,
William Walsh and Mark Fuhrman, have already pleaded guilty
and will provide evidence against defendants during the
trials.
   Justice Department procedures are also on trial in this
case. The government was harshly criticized last year for
charging several traders, including Mr. Mosky, with
racketeering -- a charge usually reserved for organized crime
figures. If traders are found guilty under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, statute, they
could forfeit hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets and
trading profits, as well as face stiff jail terms.
   Bob Mosky wasn't worried about tape recorders or
racketeering laws two years ago. The Chicago native, who
declined to be interviewed for this story, was having his
best year ever in the pits. By the end of 1988, the
studious-looking accounting major would make roughly $300,000
as a broker buying and selling Swiss franc futures for what
were then some of the biggest "houses" in the futures
business: Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Refco Group Ltd. and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., among others.
   Traders say Mr. Mosky didn't let the money go to his head.
While other pit denizens quickly traded up to condominiums
overlooking Lake Michigan and imported sports cars, Mr.
Mosky, his wife and two children lived in a three-story house
on a quiet street. He drove a Mercury Sable, his wife drove a
Chrysler. Mr. Mosky was also quick to lend a clerk $20 until
his next paycheck arrived, and give generously to charities,
traders said.
   But his crowing about winning trades apparently attracted
the attention of undercover FBI agent Randall Jannett. For
most of 1988 the agent posed as a "local" trader -- or one
who traded for himself and didn't handle customer orders --
named Randy Jackson in the Swiss franc pit.
   The government alleges in court filings that the Swiss
franc traders conspired to help each other stay in business
at the expense of customers: "Mosky, Walsh and other brokers
regularly solicited accommodating local traders {including
Zatz, Scheck, Fuhrman, undercover agent Jannett and others}
to absorb losses caused by order-filling errors, or
outtrades, and repaid such locals through the illegal
manipulation of other customer orders in their possession."
   By February 1988, Agent Jannett was frequently trading
with Mr. Mosky and stood near him in the octagonal trading
pit. Close by stood Messrs. Scheck and Zatz, who are charged
with 20 or fewer fraud counts and violations of commodity
trading laws each compared with Mr. Mosky's RICO conspiracy
charge and 78 charges of fraud and violating federal
commodity trading laws.
   On Feb. 16 Agent Jannett bought an extra contract from Mr.
Mosky to help him complete a customer's sell order, according
to a document filed to support the government's conspiracy
allegations. To repay the favor, Mr. Mosky sold the agent
nine contracts belonging to a customer at a price lower than
that prevailing in the pit at the time, the document says.
The trade essentially guaranteed that the agent would make a
profit by reselling the contracts at the higher market price,
and then pocketing the difference that should have gone to
the customer.
   "Good things happen to those who help out," Mr. Mosky told
the agent, according to the government document, which
doesn't specify when the agent tape-recorded conversations
and when he wrote them down later in his daily reports.
   Two months later Mr. Mosky bought Swiss franc futures from
an unnamed trader at a price above the market price,
effectively overcharging his customer. Then he told the
trader, "ain't I a nice guy," the document said.
   The government says it has numerous other examples of
fraudulent trades made by Mr. Mosky either with Agent
Jannett, or observed by him or the two cooperating traders.
   Since he was indicted last August, Mr. Mosky has been
trading as a marked man on the Merc floor. He has complied
with exchange requests that indicted brokers not handle
customer orders. Instead, he has been trading for his own
account to make ends meet.
   Sentiment on the Merc floor runs strongly in favor of the
indicted Swiss franc traders, who are seen as victims of a
federal witch hunt. Many traders, while aware that the
government and the Merc may be watching their every move
(there may still be government undercover agents on the
floor), have tried to help Mr. Mosky.
   "The guys have been taking care of him. They have been
feeding him trades when they could," said a currency futures
trader.
