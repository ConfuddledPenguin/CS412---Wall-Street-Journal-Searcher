   DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. -- God is acknowledged at
ServiceMaster L.P. That alone would set this international
manager of support-service workers apart from most of
corporate America. But the company credo's devotion to
serving Him is turned toward humanistic ends in trying to
counter alienation afflicting so much of the U.S. labor
force.
   ServiceMaster promises dignity to the janitors,
groundskeepers, launderers and others under its management.
It does so out of a belief, as Chairman and CEO C. William
Pollard puts it, that "every individual is created in the
image of God and has worth." That's why, in the wooden model
that sits on its officers' desks, ServiceMaster has a symbol
for the Deity supporting and balancing blocks representing
profit, achievement and personal growth.

   If that sounds like a mixture of Tom Peters and Sunday
school, don't dismiss it. The firm grew sixfold nominally in
the 1980s, combining contracts to supervise support personnel
at hospitals, schools and factories in the U.S. and abroad
with a growing line of care and maintenance services. Margins
on $1.6 billion in operating revenue also have risen, and
though share price has declined since the 1987 crash,
analysts are bullish on it.
   Work force stratification is a common morale problem in
U.S. companies, but ServiceMaster tries to minimize it.
Managers must spend time in their charges' shoes, having
their eyes opened to drudgery and insensitivity. "It's not
uncommon, for example, for the person who's doing the
housekeeping function to never be identified by {even a}
first name, to almost be part of the woodwork," Mr. Pollard
observes. "The doctor comes in to the patient room and talks
to the patient, the nurse comes in . . . they just walk by
them. Unless something goes wrong. Then it's `Pick it up] Get
that spill over there]'"
   Mr. Pollard, 51, tells of his own experience on a
custodial crew. "I'd be working in a busy corridor and I'd
hear people talking about me -- `He looks like a nice man. I
wonder why he's doing this kind of work.' Like I wouldn't be
hearing them."
   A dose of good manners would help, but Mr. Pollard has a
broader notion of the training technique. "We might
categorize it under that broad term empathy." It seems to pay
off in good business, but are the workers happier? The
company says it doesn't keep figures on turnover except at
the manager level (where it's 14% annually), but when Journal
reporter Michael J. McCarthy sought out some on the line two
years ago, they voiced contentment.
   ServiceMaster expects managers to weigh developing of
people along with the company at every turn, and "if they
don't see how they can balance those, then they're maybe not
ready to make that decision," says Mr. Pollard. He admits
fretting over firings can be a problem: "We might be
criticized for delaying our people decisions too long."
   Does this approach work as well in the different cultures?
In all of them, Mr. Pollard says, success "comes down to
basic principles: Most people want to do a good job. If
they're helped in determining what the job is, given the
right tools, recognized for and praised for performance,
they're going to respond. Whether they're in the Bronx, or in
a suburb here, or in Tokyo or Karachi or London." The trick
is to find the right words to get the simple message across
to assorted ears.
   ServiceMaster strives to raise esprit de corps by infusing
the mundane with the humane. "It's not how you mop that
floor, but how you're relating to the patient in bed," says
Mr. Pollard. For instance, a cardiologist might be called on
to express how a tidy and sanitary room enhances recovery
prospects. Soon, "we have housekeepers relating to their task
and saying, hey, I've got something to do with that person
being well. . . . It goes back to saying that person wants to
contribute. That person has value and worth. And that person
really will work better when they understand the value of
their contribution."
   That mantra seems to be effective at the low end. But what
of the middle class, whose anxieties in a corporatized and
computerized economy have been the subject of powerful essays
in recent years by commentators from the left and right? Mr.
Pollard refers to this as the "knowledge worker phenomenon"
and admits, "I'm not sure we've fully identified it." He
recently visited a Memphis call-in center for the company's
termite-inspection business. "That's an intense job]" he
recalls; an on-site supervisor observed that part-time
workers do better at it.
   Work-hour requirements figure also in managerial ranks.
Mr. Pollard has photos of about 150 key associates on a wall
map, a reminder of who "I need to travel with, have to touch.
If you look at that board, there are always four or five in
some kind of crisis." There are also few women. He knows time
demands of those jobs are a major reason, but can offer no
out.
   Home life obviously shapes the whole person, and Mr.
Pollard says he wrestles with how far he ought to intrude.
His wife is pressing him to offer marriage counseling to
employees.
   Mr. Pollard stresses that the credo notwithstanding,
ServiceMaster is not affiliated with evangelical
Christianity. He won't ask everyone on the payroll to live by
the 10 Commandments, and in fact says, "I don't think any of
us can obey" all of them resolutely. Pressed on the matter of
who is held to what standard, he responds that managers --
comprising a third of the 19,000 employees, because they
often supervise non-ServiceMaster workers -- are not free of
obligations off the job. As he puts it, "If a person is
conducting their life in such a way that it's inconsistent
with the right treatment of people -- the person is not
treating his spouse rightly -- it's pretty hard to trust him
in being responsible for people in the company."
   Bad acts, not bad apples is how Mr. Pollard views
problems, however. "Character's not a given in my judgment,"
says the one-time Wheaton College official. "A person isn't a
particular way. They may act a particular way, but the way
they act is a cumulative amount of experiences. The way
they're acting today doesn't have to be the way they act
tomorrow."
   Sometimes pride, though a biblical sin, is a help. "It is
difficult to serve unless they have first succeeded at
something," he says. Recognition isn't necessarily part of
service, and "if that's a hurdle that's been crossed, {they
have the} ability to serve humbly."
   Mixing spiritual and commercial aims is awkward, one
reason why so few big corporations try it. ServiceMaster
encourages an ethic while avoiding a specific moral code to
support it. Going even that far, and designing an
organization that rewards service performance, breaks ground.
As Peter Drucker, high priest of management and an adviser to
Mr. Pollard, puts it in the current annual report,
"ServiceMaster provides a purpose and ultimate objective for
the worker and his or her work, and therefore contributes to
that essential ingredient of dignity that has been lacking in
the past."
