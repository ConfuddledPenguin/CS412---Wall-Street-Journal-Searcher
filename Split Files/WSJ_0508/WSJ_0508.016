   DETROIT -- An association of 260 Detroit-area car dealers
is launching a direct-mail weekly publication that will
compete with local newspapers and television for a slice of
the $75 million dealers spend advertising their stores.
   The Detroit Auto Dealers Association is betting that its
paper, called Auto Dealer Direct, will appeal to dealers
turned off by the sharp rise in rates that followed the
partial merger of Detroit's daily newspapers, Gannett Co.'s
Detroit News and Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Detroit Free Press, an
official of the association said yesterday.

   Auto Dealer Direct will be mailed to about 1.4 million
households in Detroit and the surrounding suburbs, starting
Saturday, May 12. The tabloid, planned at a minimum 12 pages
per issue, will feature a page of auto-related news, a weekly
sweepstakes contest, and at least two four-color pages. It
also will offer dealers the choice of seven zoned editions.
   Detroit's car dealers have pondered launching or buying
their own publication for several years, but decided to do it
after the partial merger late last year of the once hotly
competitive News and Free Press sent local ad rates "sky
high," said Carl Fischer, head of the dealer association's
"alternative media" committee. Mr. Fischer said Auto Dealer
Direct's zoned editions will offer dealers prices as low as
$1,300 a page for 200,000 households. A full-run, one-page ad
will cost about $9,000, he said, about $1,000 a page less
than the rates charged by the metro dailies.
   The Detroit dealer group has hired Troy, Mich.-based
Media, Marketing and Promotion Inc. to produce the paper.
