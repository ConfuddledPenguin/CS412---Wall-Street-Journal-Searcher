   WASHINGTON -- The White House said President Bush will
veto a bill that would force employers to give workers time
off to care for babies or for other family health reasons.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu told business lobbyists about
the administration position at a closed meeting. The White
House later confirmed his comments.

   The "family leave" legislation is expected to come up for
a vote on the House floor this week. It would require
employers of 50 or more employees to give their workers
unpaid time off to care for newborn or adopted babies; for
seriously ill children, spouses or parents; or for personal
health problems.
   The bill, which the Senate Labor Committee also has
approved, is vigorously opposed by business groups. They say
it would be too costly, and they object to legislation that
mandates employers to provide time off.
   The White House has said Mr. Bush would veto a bill
mandating such benefits, but it hadn't pledged specifically
to veto the current bill. The administration maintains that
the government shouldn't dictate the specific benefits
employees receive, arguing that "employers have a better
sense" of what should be offered, said Deputy White House
press secretary Alixe Glen.
