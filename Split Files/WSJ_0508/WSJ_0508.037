   SINGAPORE -- Singapore's gross domestic product grew by
10.1% in the first quarter, the republic's Ministry of Trade
and Industry said.
   Official estimates are calling for a GDP growth of 6% to
8% in 1990, compared with 9.2% in 1989. The first-quarter
growth compares favorably with the 9.6% rate registered in
the first quarter of 1989 and the 8.9% recorded in the last
quarter of 1989.
