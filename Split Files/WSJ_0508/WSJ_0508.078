   In other management changes, all of which a spokesman said
were expected and "not an upheaval by any means," Charles O.
O'Brien, 61, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, and Jack Schneller, 62, senior vice president, will
retire at year end.
   Effective Jan. 1, the company said, it will add the
following to its board: Leo Bontempo, president, agricultural
division; Harold Kinne, president, additive division; Vernon
Lemaster, president, dyestuff and chemical division; Dr. Rolf
Meyer, vice president, finance and information systems; and
