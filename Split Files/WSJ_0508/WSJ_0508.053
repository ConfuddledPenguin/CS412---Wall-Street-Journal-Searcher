   With Excess Capacity Set the Agenda

   GENEVA -- In OPEC these days, some oil ministers are more
equal than others.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that
whirled through here last week for an emergency meeting is
markedly different from the one that hovered over world oil
markets for three decades. Not long ago, ministers from the
tiniest of the 13 member-nations could be found in
acrimonious eyeball-to-eyeball debate, and their dissent
could stall talks for days.

   Now, a handful of oil superpowers increasingly sets the
agenda for and determines the outcome of such meetings, with
much of the negotiating taking place before meetings.
   "Those with the excess capacity have the power," says
Lawrence Goldstein of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation
based in New York.
   Only four countries ringing the oil-rich Persian Gulf --
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- plus Venezuela command
the reserves and pumping ability that will be needed to
address long-term world demand. That group, founding members
of OPEC, alone accounts for more than 60% of the world's one
trillion barrels of proved oil reserves. Except possibly for
the United Arab Emirates, also on the Persian Gulf, the rest
of OPEC is believed either to be already pumping at or near
capacity, or likely to reach that stage soon.
   "We've reached a point where eight or nine countries have
factored themselves out of the decision-making process" in
OPEC, says Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister.
   Certainly, the clout of OPEC's bit players is diminishing
as the top producers call the shots more than ever before.
Consider the just-concluded meeting here:
   Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister, checked into
Geneva's Intercontinental Hotel largely ignored and carrying
his own suitcase. As he did at the previous meeting in Vienna
last March, he spent a lot of time in his hotel room alone
while ministers from OPEC's major producers huddled in huge
suites down the hall.
   Mr. Tamariz concedes that he doesn't have much of a role
in such strategy sessions anymore; his oil production of less
than 300,000 barrels a day is just too small. Ecuador, ranked
12th, pumps barely more than 1% of the total 23.5 million
barrels a day recently being produced by all 13 members of
OPEC.
   At least he was here. Gabon and Qatar, two other
small-scale members, didn't even send their oil ministers
this time -- or last. This is a major turnabout for OPEC's
smaller producers who only a few years ago were among the
cartel's pricing leaders. For example, Libya was the first to
break the $30-a-barrel level and others followed.
   Even more telling were the behind-the-scenes negotiations
leading up to the session.
   With prices skidding 25% this year, the oil markets wanted
a signal that OPEC would corral output, which by some
estimates had been running 1.5 million barrels a day above
its self-imposed ceiling and two million above demand. In a
significant move, Indonesian minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita,
a respected and frequent mediator in OPEC affairs, concluded
a full ministerial meeting wasn't needed. He sent a facsimile
message to Saudi Arabia asking oil minister Hisham Nazer to
simply work out a solution to the crisis with other Persian
Gulf nations.
   Mr. Ginandjar's logic was sound. After all, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and United Arab Emirates, among OPEC's largest
producers, had sparked the price decline by producing beyond
quota and flooding the market. And the three responded with a
quick meeting in Jeddah last month, where they promised to
adhere to their assigned quotas. But oil prices continued to
slide.
   With much of OPEC in a near panic, the acting president,
Sadek Boussena of Algeria, hastily called an urgent meeting
of all the ministers and drew up a script that would make
OPEC appear swift and decisive. But Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
maintained a grip on the process because its success or
failure depended on their willingness to cut output. In the
end, they endorsed a plan that, on paper at least, would
erase nearly all the overproduction. The meeting lasted less
than two days -- one of OPEC's shortest ever.
   Appropriately, the same two cartel heavyweights pledged to
shoulder almost 60% of the cut, effectively taking on
responsibility for the price of oil for the near future.
   The concentration of OPEC's future production ability and
pricing power within a few nations doesn't automatically
spell trouble for oil consumers. Though OPEC accounts for 45%
of consumption by the non-Communist world, the leading
producers are launching multibillion-dollar programs to
further expand their huge capacities even as the oil fields
of others play out. Moreover, the current glut suggests that
the large producers are still more interested in gaining
market share than in working in concert to force higher and
higher prices.
   Within OPEC, of course, the potential implications of a
majority of members running out of oil are enormous. In time,
OPEC meetings could become meaningless or even disappear. The
Persian Gulf powers -- the only producers with real growth
potential -- could divide up the market in informal talks,
perhaps at most asking other ministers to rubber-stamp each
newly cut bargain.
   Some oil ministers insist that it's only a matter of time
before national production quotas -- necessary in recent
years of excess capacity -- disappear just because most
members will be physically unable to pump more oil. "After
three or four years, the problem will be prices, not the
quotas," says Fawzi A. Shakshuki, Libya's oil minister.
   Already, some members are accepting the notion of running
out of oil. Indonesia so openly acknowledges it has bumped up
against its production limits that its minister, Mr.
Ginandjar, last November broke a logjam by surrendering some
of Indonesia's allotment to others. Last week he again
volunteered output cuts to break an impasse. Others are
having reality imposed on them.
   At the November meeting, a request by Mr. Shakshuki that
Libya be granted production parity with Kuwait as part of
that meeting's pact faced great resistance. In the end, he
finally had to sign onto the settlement, winning nothing.
"Who cares what Libya thinks?" one delegate said.
   If nothing else, OPEC's meetings are losing their cache.
Short-and-sweet gatherings are replacing the drawn-out combat
of the past. In bygone days, chaos ruled when OPEC gathered
at the Intercontinental Hotel here. As many as 600 reporters
and scores of traders, economists and investors jammed the
lobby and hallways, nursing coffee and drinks and watching
ministers openly scrap. The crowd, rabid for the slightest
scrap of information, would pounce on any official who
strayed by. Fewer than 100 people monitored last week's
meeting, filling less than one-third of the lobby.
   The shrinking of OPEC's unused capacity to five million
barrels a day from the 10 million or 11 million barrels of
less than a decade ago is prompting some to question the
future role of the organization.
   "Why should we limit ourselves only to oil?" asks Felix P.
Rossi-Guerrero, a Venezuelan ambassador-at-large. "We could
hold meetings on agriculture. We could talk about trade and
the environment," he says. Mr. Nazer of Saudi Arabia, which
boasts one-fourth of the world's total oil reserves, also
sees new roles for OPEC, such as oil-related training and
technical assistance.
   Still, it's unlikely that OPEC anytime soon will hold a
meeting and no one will come. "The big brothers need the
shield of the small fry" so they can retain their claim as
defender of the Third World and avoid becoming known as a
rich man's club, says one former oil minister. And the small
fry need the superpowers for price protection, bargaining
leverage and political prestige. Without the OPEC umbrella,
small producers say they would never have been able to
nationalize their oil fields or develop them on favorable
terms with the international oil companies.
   Many, therefore, will struggle to preserve their status,
however humble, within the group. That's already happening in
Mr. Tamariz's Ecuador, where gasoline taxes have been boosted
to discourage domestic consumption and maximize the amount of
oil available for export. As a result, bicycles and public
transportation are carrying more and more workers in Quito,
the capital, to their jobs.
