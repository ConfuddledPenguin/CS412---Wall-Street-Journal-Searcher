   CHICAGO -- Playboy Enterprises Inc. said it plans to
convert its thinly traded common stock into separate voting
and nonvoting classes, a move that would allow it to issue
more shares while preserving founder Hugh Hefner's control of
the company.
   The move will provide management with additional financial
flexibility, the publishing concern said, by permitting
Playboy to use equity for possible future acquisitions,
financings, and employee benefit plans -- without diluting
the voting power of Mr. Hefner's 71% stake.

   The plan would also enable the 64-year-old former chairman
and chief executive officer to retain voting control of the
company while disposing of up to three-quarters of his
Playboy holdings.
   All stockholders, "including Mr. Hefner," notes a consent
solicitation being mailed to shareholders, will get
"increased flexibility to dispose of a portion of their
equity interest in the company and otherwise determine the
extent of their equity ownership without necessarily
affecting their relative voting power."
   The document also says Playboy "is not aware of any
current intention by Mr. Hefner to dispose of any portion of
his equity interest in the company." Mr. Hefner is more
likely to dispose of his nonvoting shares than his Class A
stock, "over time," the solicitation says.
   Mr. Hefner, who suffered a stroke in 1985, married a
26-year-old former Playmate last year. His daughter, Christie
Hefner, assumed the chairman and chief executive jobs in late
1988 after serving as president. A spokeswoman noted that Mr.
Hefner has previously made it clear that "it is his intent to
have Christie continue to run the company."
   Dual-class arrangements aren't rare in the publishing
business: founding families of New York Times Co., Dow Jones
&amp; Co., and Washington Post Co., for example, all maintain
voting control through special classes of stock.
   Playboy's recap plan calls for it to carry out a 1-for-2
reverse split of its current shares, reducing the number of
common shares outstanding to 4.7 million from 9.4 million.
Those shares will then be "reclassified" as Class A stock,
each having one vote. The Class A shares will then each pay a
dividend of three shares of non-voting Class B Playboy
shares, which the company will seek to have traded on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Playboy said it and financial adviser Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. believe that the two classes of stock "should
trade at approximately equal prices." Playboy's plan includes
a "minority protection" feature designed to deter would-be
raiders from taking control of the company on the cheap by
purchasing only the voting stock: Any person acquiring more
than 10% of the voting stock must offer to acquire Class B
shares proportionate to their voting-class holdings.
   Although Mr. Hefner's support of the deal appears to make
it a sure thing, holders of record on May 16 will be eligible
to vote on the plan, with implementation scheduled for June
8. The Big Board has advised Playboy that the issuance of
nonvoting stock wouldn't violate restrictions on dual-class
stocks the Big Board adopted in 1988.
   Because Playboy certificates once attracted interest as
potential collectors' items, the company has historically had
a higher-than-average number of single-share stockholders. In
a move Playboy expects to save about $100,000 annually in
servicing costs, those holders won't receive fractional
shares in the reverse split, but will receive a cash payment
based on the price of the stock in the days preceding the
conversion.
   In an interview, Ms. Hefner said she expects the
conversion will enhance the stock's liquidity, and spark
increased interest from institutional holders, who have
largely avoided the thinly traded stock because of its small
"float." Use of the stock in management-benefit plans also
will help attract top executives, she said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Playboy closed at $12.785 a share, up 12.5 cents.
