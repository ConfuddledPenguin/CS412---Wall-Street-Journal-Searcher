   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Siliconix Inc. said it is in direct
negotiations with International Rectifier Corp. with regard
to an April 9 patent infringement ruling.
   A federal judge ruled in April that the semiconductor
maker had infringed on certain patents related to
International Rectifier's power transistor technology. Partly
as a result of the adverse judgment, Siliconix subsequently
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.

   Siliconix said it has met with International Rectifier
several times since the court ruling, and added that it hopes
the parties can reach an agreement soon to resolve the
four-year-old dispute.
