   NEW YORK -- In 1978, "The Stand" was Stephen King's first
best seller, selling fewer than 100,000 copies in hardcover.
A new, longer version of the novel is now for sale at nearly
double the price, and publisher Doubleday has printed one
million copies.
   The original "Stand" hit the New York Times best seller
list at 15th place and climbed no farther than No. 13: The
new version of the novel will start on the New York Times
list Sunday, in first place. A signed, limited edition of
1,250 copies in black leather stamped with gold is sold out
at $325 each; book collectors have offered the publisher as
much as $1,200 for a copy.

   Reflected in this episode are the vast changes in the
market for hardcover books over the past decade, but the
principal factor is the singular phenomenon of Mr. King's
popularity. Also, Doubleday, a division of Bertelsmann AG's
Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc. subsidiary, has
pulled out all promotional stops to incite the fans.
   In addition to the deluxe edition, Doubleday got
bookstores across the country to take "reservations" for the
book (which sometimes resulted in a discount) and set up a
special "Stand Hotline" with the details of what's included
in the book. About 200 people a day still call the hotline,
though the book has arrived at most stores in recent weeks.
   When Mr. King approached Doubleday in the mid-80s about
re-issuing the novel, the publisher was skeptical, despite
Mr. King's record for the most best sellers of the past
decade. Doubleday had originally cut about 400 pages from the
book because production costs would have mandated a hardcover
price of $12.95, which seemed too high in 1978 for a
non-best-selling author. "You had an already monstrous book
(823 pages)," says Peter Schneider, Doubleday's director of
marketing. "It's a tremendous story, but would people buy it
again?"
   Bookstore managers say they'll be surprised if Doubleday
can move one million copies of "The Stand: The Complete and
Uncut Edition" in hardcover. But they do expect it to sell
many times better than the original version, which is
extremely rare. In the odd instance when an updated version
of a book is issued, it generally sells far fewer copies, as
when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's book "August 1914" was
re-issued 17 years later with 80% new material. (Exact sales
figures aren't available.)
   "So far, it isn't doing quite as well as a new Stephen
King, but it's awfully close," says Tom Simon, vice president
of merchandising for the Waldenbooks subsidiary of K mart
Corp. "The big question is the staying power: Is this just a
flurry, or will it stay No. 1 for several months, like most
of his books?"
   One reason for Doubleday's optimistic print run is the
basic change in the hardcover market: While only the hottest
best sellers sold above 75,000 copies in the '70s, best
sellers now routinely sell above 300,000 in hardcover. The
rapid growth in the bookstore chains, along with the more
recent growth in warehouse stores and discount clubs, has
spread books into hundreds of new outlets, most of which
offer substantial discounts to the cover price. The
perception of hardcover books as a splurge has moderated:
Retail price for "The Stand" is $24.95, high even for a major
author, but buyers can find it discounted up to 40%.
   Booksellers say that if this ploy works, Mr. King deserves
the credit. "Danielle Steel, for one, has a huge following,
but I don't think you could re-release one of her back
titles," says Gary DelVecchio, president of Doubleday Book
Shops (no relation to the book's publisher). "Stephen King is
in a class by himself. He's got almost a cult following."
   Not only are his first editions the most prized of
contemporary authors' to collectors, but Mr. King himself is
the subject of more books than he's written, says George
Beahm, author of "The Stephen King Companion." And "The
Stand," with a complicated, fantasy plot about good and evil
and the end of the world, is considered his best book by
fans. "It's ironic," says Mr. Beahm, "that what was once
considered this book's weak point, its length, is now touted
as its strong point."

   DOUBLEDAY, a unit of Bertelsmann AG's Bantam Doubleday
Dell Publishing Group Inc., has so far printed more than half
a million copies of "The Stand: The Complete and Uncut
Edition" by Stephen King. Yesterday's edition misstated the
number of copies that has been printed.
