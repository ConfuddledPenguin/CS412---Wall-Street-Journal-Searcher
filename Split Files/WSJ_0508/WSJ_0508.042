   Hanif Kureishi's first two produced screenplays, "My
Beautiful Laundrette" and "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid," brought
him wide attention as a perceptive chronicler of immigrant
life in London, the man who could portray what it was like to
be the object of "Paki-bashing," the great sport of England's
Skinheads.
   Not only are his movies messages about racism and life on
the underside of Thatcher's England, they also deal frankly
with sex -- both straight and homosexual.

   I don't know when Mr. Kureishi began to write his first
novel "The Buddha of Suburbia" (Viking, 284 pages, $18.95)
but it is set in the 1970s and reads as though it was an
early treatment of his experiences as a young man of
non-English heritage growing up in Kent outside London.
Perhaps it was put aside in favor of the 1985 "Laundrette"
and 1987 "Sammy and Rosie."
   The novel covers the same terrain of racism, class
tensions and sex, but in more overtly autobiographical,
coming-of-age style. It is awkward and uncertain where the
films seemed confident.
   Like Mr. Kureishi's movies, "Buddha" has an array of
interesting characters and subplots, but without the dramatic
power of visual images, the novel seems rambling and
inconsequential.
   The Buddha of the title is an Indian immigrant working as
an insignificant clerk in Britain's civil service, commuting
quietly from the Kent suburb where he has installed his
English wife and two sons.
   As the novel opens, he is embarking on adultery with a
somewhat more affluent suburbanite who encourages him to give
evening recitations of half-baked mystic pronouncements to
rapt living room audiences.
   Adultery and punditry liberate him, and he takes the
narrator, his 17-year-old son Karim, with him when his new
love moves her menage to London.
   The potential humor of the charlatan mystic and his
gullible flock is quickly pushed aside in favor of Karim's
own tale of leaving school and struggling to begin an acting
career.
   Even more unfortunately, Mr. Kureishi also relegates to
the background his most interesting characters, the
politically and sexually active young woman Jamila and her
mail-order husband, Changez.
   Mr. Kureishi finds some of his richest material in the
intersections of South Asian and British traditions. He is
drawn to the follies of English women who will take as a
Buddha a fat civil servant. In Jamila, he creates a liberated
woman who has smashed to smithereens the behavior patterns of
her immigrant Moslem parents.
   What weapon does her father have to bend Jamila to his
will? Gandhi's weapon, of course. So, in suburban London,
above his shabby little grocery named Paradise Stores,
Jamila's father fasts to force her to accept the husband his
brother in India has selected for her. His fast takes him
close to death before she caves in.
   But even after she agrees to marry, she will have no
physical contact with the deformed, obese Changez. This, in
turn drives Changez into the play-for-pay arms of a Japanese
woman with whom he can try out the sexual positions and toys
he reads about in his ever-growing collection of paperback
fiction.
   The novel's funniest moment comes when the now-regretful
father, infuriated by Changez, attacks him with a cane and
Changez defends himself with a just-purchased sex aid. The
father is hospitalized; Karim and Jamila dub Changez, in the
manner of his favorite fiction, "The Dildo Killer."
   Mr. Kureishi's films are funny, charming and (mildly)
shocking by turns. He seems to be aiming for the same effects
here. He has a talent for description. When Mr. Kureishi
describes the facades lining a street, you could build the
movie set.
   But, the first-person narration is weak. Karim is a naive
teen-ager when the novel opens and he seems awkward and
adolescent to the end. He observes, but never becomes an
emotionally engaging character.
   At times Karim is unintentionally funny. "Life had offered
these people its lips, but as they dragged from party to
party, seeing the same faces and saying the same things night
after night, I saw it was the kiss of death; I saw how much
was enervated and useless in them," he tells us of a wealthy
London crowd.
   His attempts at literary allusion fall flat: "The ceremony
of innocence was well drowned as far as they were concerned,"
he says of a group of sexually precocious female schoolmates.
(Peace, W.B. Yeats)
   Karim's thoughts on sex, a major preoccupation, are no
more interesting. Both sexes attract and please Karim,
prompting him to attempt a simile: "I felt it would be
heart-breaking to have to choose one or the other, like
having to decide between the Beatles and the Rolling Stones."
   Karim-in-love is as unconvincing as Karim-brokenhearted.
Because he generally takes sexual partners as casually as
others would choose their music, the novel fails when it
attempts to portray two sexual episodes as major turning
points in his life. Even group sex and masochism seem
uninflected in "Buddha's" listless narration.
   Karim drifts from experience to experience, and the novel
drifts with him, lacking focus, lacking a point of view.
"Perhaps in the future I would live more deeply," Karim tells
us on the last page.
   Let's hope.
