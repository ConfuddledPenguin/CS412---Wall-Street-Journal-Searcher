   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. received a five-year
contract valued at $40 million from Pan American World
Airways Inc. for computer and network systems.
   New York-based AT&amp;T will install personal computers and
local area network systems for managing the airline's
reservations and baggage-handling operations in about 100
locations world-wide.

   The contract, the second-largest commercial computer
contract ever received by AT&amp;T, also calls for the company to
maintain computer equipment used by the airline from other
suppliers.
   The idea, said Robert O. Wagner, Pan Am's vice president
of information services, is to create the "airport of the
future" where ticket issuing, baggage handling and boarding
are automated.
