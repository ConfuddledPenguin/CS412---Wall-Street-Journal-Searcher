   Leggett &amp; Platt Inc. extended its $2.50-a-share tender
offer for Dresher Inc. to May 9 from May 4, because antitrust
regulators haven't yet cleared the proposed $11.4 million
acquisition.
   Leggett, a Carthage, Mo., maker of furniture and bed
parts, began the offer for the maker of brass beds early last
month. But on April 19, it disclosed that the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division had requested additional
information. Leggett warned at the time that the offer might
have to be extended.

   As of the original May 4 deadline, Dresher said, about
2,544,000 shares, or 56% of Dresher's outstanding common, had
been tendered or guaranteed for delivery.
   Leggett &amp; Platt and Dresher said they both "continue to
believe" that the proposed acquisition of Dresher "will not
violate the antitrust laws."
   Leggett's extended offer expires at 11:59 p.m. EDT May 9.
