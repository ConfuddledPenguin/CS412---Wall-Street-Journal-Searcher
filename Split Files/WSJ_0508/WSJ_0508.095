   TORONTO -- Toronto's city council last night began a
debate that could hamper Canadian Pacific Ltd.'s 750 million
Canadian dollar (US$645 million) spinoff of its real estate
unit, Marathon Realty Co.
   A resolution before the council calls for changing the
zoning of about 200 acres of prime undeveloped land -- some
of which is owned by Marathon -- footsteps away from
Toronto's financial district. The motion seeks to reduce by
as much as 75% the amount of commercial building space
permitted for the site, where 15 million square feet of
commercial building space is currently permitted. Also, the
number of housing units on the land would be doubled.

   Marathon owns about 35 acres of the affected land in a
parcel called Southtown, and it plans to develop, among other
things, as much as six million square feet of office space
over the next 10 to 15 years.
   Canadian Pacific is spinning off 80% of Marathon through a
share distribution to CP's shareholders. CP will retain the
other 20% of Marathon. Upon distribution, Marathon would have
about 99 million shares outstanding, making it Canada's most
widely held public real estate company. Marathon's shares are
expected to begin trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange
within the next two weeks.
   Donald King, president and chief executive officer of
Marathon, said in an interview that a vote supporting the
motion to revise the zoning of the undeveloped land would
jeopardize the company's current plans to develop its 35-acre
site. Analysts said that could depress the company's stock
price, making it a potential takeover target.
   Fred Ketchen, vice president of equity trading at
Toronto-based Scotia-McLeod Inc., said there has been
substantial interest in Marathon stock by both buyers and
sellers since "gray-market" trading began April 25. In
gray-market trading, investors promise to buy or sell the
stock at certain prices when the stock is listed.
   More than 2.1 million Marathon shares traded in the gray
market Friday as the stock closed down 12.5 Canadian cents to
C$7.38. Marathon rallied in gray-market trading yesterday and
by late afternoon was at C$7.63 to C$7.75 in brisk trading.
   "There is an increasing likelihood that someone could take
a run at Marathon, especially if the stock continues trading
at an obscene discount to net asset value," said Brad Smith,
analyst at Toronto-based Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.
   Mr. Smith estimates that Marathon has a net asset value of
C$20 to C$21 a share, in large part due to hidden values in
strategic land assets such as its downtown Toronto property.
Like its parent, Marathon has a shareholder rights plan that
would distribute additional shares to shareholders if a
concern other than Canadian Pacific obtains 15% of the
outstanding shares.
   But few analysts agree on Marathon's asset values or
appropriate share price, given the uncertainty over the
future of its Southtown property and the hazards of a
softening Canadian real estate market.
   "I think takeover speculation is overdone in light of
current circumstances," said Frank Mayer, analyst at
Toronto's BBN James Capel Inc.
   Mr. Mayer said a renegotiation of zoning on the downtown
Toronto lands, which could take years and could get mired in
lawsuits, could depress Marathon's stock price by more than
C$1. He said the stock currently is trading on a takeover
premium, although there isn't any indication that an investor
or other Canadian real estate concern is accumulating shares.
   Mr. King agreed with analysts that institutional investors
or large Canadian real estate concerns could be interested in
acquiring Marathon shares up to the 15% threshold permitted
by its rights plan. He also acknowledged that there are some
selling pressures on the stock. U.S. shareholders of Canadian
Pacific may be pressed to sell their Marathon stock because
the distribution of Marathon shares to Canadian Pacific's
U.S. shareholders is taxable. In Canada, the distribution
isn't taxable. About 30% of Canadian Pacific shares are held
outside Canada. Also, certain Canadian Pacific shareholders
may not be interested in holding a pure real estate stock,
Mr. King said.
   As for Marathon's outlook for the current year, Mr. King
said he expects continued growth in the company's assets and
cash flow, but he cautioned that 1989 was an "exceptional
year." In 1989, Marathon had cash flow of C$135.8 million, or
C$1.37 a share on pro forma basis, compared with C$70.4
million or 71 Canadian cents a share in 1988. Land sales
contributed a substantial chunk of 1989 cash flow. Mr. King
said he expects that the second half of this year will be
better than the first half. Cash flow in the 1990 first
quarter was C$17.9 million or 18 cents a share.
