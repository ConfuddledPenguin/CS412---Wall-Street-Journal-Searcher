   WASHINGTON -- The Justice and Commerce departments
proposed legislation offering companies involved in joint
production ventures reduced risk of antitrust action by the
government.
   The bill would require the courts to consider such
economic benefits as reduced production costs and increased
competitiveness with foreign industries before concluding
that joint ventures violate antitrust laws. It also would
reduce antitrust liability to single damages from treble
damages for companies involved in such cooperative ventures,
provided the companies clear the joint ventures in advance
with the government.

   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the legislation
would be especially helpful to high-technology industries,
although he declined to cite any examples. "It's going to
work across the broad spectrum," he said. Mr. Mosbacher added
that the bill would help U.S. industries battle foreign
competition, especially from Japan and Europe.
   In 1984, Congress reduced antitrust liability for
companies involved in joint research and development
projects. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), a co-author of
that legislation, said that extending the protection to
manufacturing carried the approach too far. He added that the
new proposal "would do little to improve America's
competitiveness and would do much to undermine the laws that
promote competition."
