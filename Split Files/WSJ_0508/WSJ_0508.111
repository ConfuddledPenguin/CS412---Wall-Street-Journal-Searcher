   The Soviet Union is buying U.S. corn at a near-record
pace, but there are nagging concerns about its ability to pay
bills.
   The Agriculture Department confirmed that the Soviets had
purchased 1,750,000 metric tons of corn. But grain experts
speculate that the Soviets needed Japanese credit to pull off
the deals, another sign of Moscow's eroding reputation as a
reliable and savvy trader.

   Last fall, the Soviet Union took the unusual step of
asking for short-term credit to buy U.S. crops; it
traditionally had paid cash. Then this spring, it began
having problems providing collateral to back the credit, and
some U.S. grain merchants temporarily stopped taking new
business. New York-based Continental Grain Co., for example,
stayed on the sidelines during the bidding on one shipment of
wheat to the Soviets.
   Around three weeks ago came the first reports that the
Soviets had to turn to Japanese trading firms for credit to
finance U.S. purchases. More recently, there have been
widespread reports that the Soviets are falling behind on
payments to Western companies for everything from steel to
wool.
   According to U.S. grain industry officials, Soviet buying
is being hampered by internal confusion over the
restructuring of the Soviet bureaucracy and economy. Moscow
also has been pinched by flat prices for oil and gold, two
commodities it sells as a source of currency for importing
goods.
   The Soviet cash crunch might get worse in the wake of
Moscow's announcement that it is boosting the price it pays
to Soviet grain farmers an average of 50%.
   The move is intended to boost domestic production, which
would reduce its dependency on foreign grain, but in the near
term the Soviet budget deficit would balloon.
   Last fall, tremors rippled through the world grain markets
when Moscow unveiled an unusual program to reward Soviet
wheat farmers who exceed production goals. Traders were
worried that the Soviets might have to trim spending on
imports in order to finance the domestic wheat-growing
incentives. Because of inefficient growing practices and
staggering losses due to spoilage, the Soviet Union is one of
the largest importers of food.
   The Soviet Union still carries considerable clout. It is
one of the biggest buyers of U.S. crops, and most grain
industry officials and traders insist on anonymity when
discussing the Soviet Union's murky financial woes.
   Indeed, the Soviet problems so far haven't had a
noticeable effect on grain prices in the U.S. The Japanese
credit is probably enough to allow the Soviets to finish
their grain purchases before the summer, which is when Soviet
grain imports dwindle as its own crops matures, said Bill
Biedermann, director of research at Allendale Inc. in
suburban Chicago.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, prices of corn futures
contracts for May delivery rose 3.5 cents a bushel to settle
at $2.9075 a bushel. Prices of soybean and wheat futures
contracts also rose sharply amid heavy buying by commodity
funds and futures brokerage firms.
   Despite its payment problems, the Soviet Union is managing
to keep pace with last year's hefty level of corn purchases.
Since October, Moscow has agreed to buy roughly 15.6 million
metric tons of U.S. corn. The Soviet record is roughly 16
million metric tons, purchased in the year ended Sept. 30,
1989.
   The Soviet credit problems, however, are strengthening
calls for the U.S. to grant it most-favored-nation trading
status, which would make it eligible for preferential
treatment and credits from Washington.
   The severity of the Soviet credit problems isn't clear,
but they are affecting many of its imports. The Soviet Union
is reportedly asking the major wool-producing nations of
Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Uruguay to extend
credit on purchases.
   The New Zealand Council of Wool Exporters said its members
halted shipments to the Soviets because of unpaid bills
totaling $30 million. The Australian Wool Exporters Council
said the Soviets owe its members more than 100 million
Australian dollars (US$75.6 million) for wool that has been
shipped and another A$50 million for wool that has been
ordered.
   The group said it received a telex from Novoexport, the
Soviet Union's import agency, requesting an extension of
credit.

   SUGAR: Futures prices were mixed in light activity, in
part because London markets were closed for a bank holiday.
The soonest-to-expire July and October contracts, which have
no trading limits and fell more than one cent a pound Friday,
recovered slightly. The July contract rose 0.16 cent a pound
to 14.60 cents and October advanced 0.06 cent to 14.56 cents.
More deferred contracts, however, whose declines were
restricted Friday by trading limits of 0.50 cent a pound,
continued to fall and were off 0.28 cent to 0.30 cent.
Friday's shakeout reflects growing pessimism that world
demand won't be sufficient to cause shortages of sugar,
according to Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,
New York. "Such concerns come after a long absence of buying
from China and India, both of which had been expected to have
substantial import needs earlier in the year," Ms. Kaul said.
She noted that news reports cited ample supplies of sugar in
China and expectations of record production in India. These
reports further fueled pessimism about prices, she said.
However, Chinese officials still cited the need to import
about two million tons of sugar, but no purchases have been
made, Ms. Kaul said. In India, officials have yet to rule out
the possibility of imports, as even with record output only a
small surplus will remain at the end of this season, she
noted. Ms. Kaul said that in her view, "the timing of such
reports in the wake of Friday's sharp break indicates these
potential purchasers may be trying to push prices down to
even lower levels before making purchases." Separately, the
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange said that Friday's trading
volume in the world sugar contract amounted to a record
81,320 contracts, topping the previous record of 59,989
contracts, set on July 6, 1989. Shearson's Ms. Kaul observed
that the total open interest, or the number of contracts
outstanding that remain to be liquidated by either an
opposite trade or delivery of the commodity, fell only 7,431
contracts to 178,026 contracts. She said this indicated that,
while some fresh buying may have been attracted by the
decline, many traders liquidated long positions and went
short, or sold contracts in anticipation that prices will go
even lower. This situation could set the stage for a
potential rebound if these short sellers have to cover, or
buy back, their positions, Ms. Kaul said.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose, largely on news that a
major pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico was closed down as a
result of a leak. West Texas Intermediate for June delivery
rose 29 cents a barrel to close at $18.27 in trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Already, production of 95,000
barrels a day has been halted from platforms owned by several
major U.S. energy companies, according to a spokesman for
Texaco Inc., which operates the pipeline. It's unclear how
much of an impact the spill from the pipeline, which has a
capacity of 125,000 barrels a day, will ultimately have on
pricing. Texaco says that it doesn't yet know how long the
pipeline will be shut down. Divers were on their way to the
scene to try and determine where the break might have
occurred. Texaco said that about 900 barrels of crude oil
have spilled into the Gulf's waters. Early indications
suggest that the 20-inch pipeline is the source. The pipe
serves 36 production platforms in the area. Texaco has
accepted responsibility for the cleanup and as of late
yesterday there was one skimmer ship on the scene. Others
were expected to arrive within hours. The spill covers an
area at least five miles wide by 20 miles long.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices eased in quiet trading. The July
contract fell 1.60 cents a pound to $1.0965. The softer tone
to the market reflected the return to work of Southern Peru
Copper Corp. employees in Peru, said Fred Demler, metals
economist for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. The miners and
smelter employees resumed work Friday in compliance with a
government order that threatened them with the loss of their
jobs if they didn't return, Mr. Demler noted. However,
management and unions will resume their negotiations
tomorrow, he said. A three-day sympathy strike by Peruvian
miners was scheduled to start yesterday, but as the Southern
Peru employees have returned, the strike was canceled,
according to Mr. Demler. Bullish factors in the market, he
noted, are that inventories of copper still remain low,
world-wide demand for the metal continues strong, and labor
contracts with U.S. and Canadian copper companies are
scheduled to expire at the end of June. The approach of
negotiations and the possibility of strikes are likely to
create concern about production disruptions, Mr. Demler said.
