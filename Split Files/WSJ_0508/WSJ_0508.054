   Valvoline Inc., one of the oldest sponsors of auto racing,
is waving a yellow flag. Its favorite sport is getting too
expensive, too fast.
   At the Indianapolis 500 later this month, the motor-oil
company's name probably will be seen on just 17 cars, about
half as many as it sponsored a decade ago. Valvoline used to
be able to cover the track with its marketing dollars, says
John D. Barr, president of Valvoline, a unit of Ashland Oil
Co. "But the price has escalated so rapidly, we can't do that
anymore."

   For Valvoline, along with other longtime racing sponsors
such as Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Quaker State Corp., the
marketing appeal of the track is fading, even as the
popularity of the sport explodes. Car racing, they say, is
suffering from sponsor overload. Spark-plug makers, motor-oil
producers and other auto-related companies once had the track
to themselves. No more. Sponsors have poured in, bidding up
the price tags on winning teams and increasing the clutter of
brand names on wheels. These days, race cars are sponsored by
everything from Tide detergent to Secret deodorant to Hanes
garments. Wedging into this year's Indy races for the first
time will be Snickers candy bars, McDonald's, Panasonic,
Target Stores and Gillette.
   "Every car you look at is a traveling billboard,"
complains Leo Mehl, director of racing for Goodyear.
   The number of sponsors for Indy-style racing this year has
climbed to 165 from 90 in 1985, while spending has soared 90%
to $95 million, according to Championship Auto Racing Teams
Inc., or Cart, the sanctioning group for Indy car racing.
   To get their brands displayed on a top race team's cars,
sponsors have to shell out fees ranging from $50,000 to $5
million a year, depending on the size of decals and other
factors, such as endorsements in ads. On top of that,
sponsors also usually provide fuel, uniforms and other
support materials. Companies also say that for each
sponsorship dollar, they spend another $1 to $3 on related
promotions and advertising, such as billboards and
sweepstakes.
   Racing enthusiasts and professionals say sponsorship mania
and the resulting climb in prices stem directly from the
growing interest in all types of auto racing, whether rural
drag strips, the Indy races or stock-car racing. Expanded
television coverage on broadcast and cable networks, along
with aggressive promotions, have helped build interest in the
sport, especially among women, who now make up half the
audience at some races. Awareness is likely to increase even
further this summer with the opening of "Days of Thunder," a
car-racing movie starring the popular actor Tom Cruise.
   As popularity increases, there's competition to get
display on the best team's cars, so "now you've got to spend
more money to get bigger visibility," says Don Dixon,
chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Marketing Services. Racing
experts say Philip Morris Cos. paid an estimated $35 million
in a three-year pact to sponsor two cars. (A company
spokesman declines to comment on terms of the deal.)
   Valvoline spends about $10 million a year on motor sports
sponsorships. That's three times what it spent in 1980, so
the company now is trying to be selective to hold the line on
costs. Racing has been religion at Valvoline for nearly three
decades, so dropping some programs isn't popular. "It's the
most sensitive issue in the company," Mr. Barr says.
   Spending has shifted to focus on where the brand's name
will get the best exposure. At various tracks, there will be
fewer billboards featuring the Valvoline logo. In some cases,
the company is sponsoring events, rather than teams. For a
fraction of what it costs to support a team for a year,
Valvoline nows sponsors the Detroit Grand Prix, which is
billed as the Valvoline Detroit Grand Prix.
   There's no fully sponsored Valvoline car in the National
Association of Stock Car Racing circuit. The company couldn't
strike a deal with a top team. If the company does link up
with a good team, some other ad spending may be cut to
compensate. "It might be worth more exposure than 10
television commercials," Mr. Barr says. Valvoline still has
one fully sponsored Indy car, driven by Al Unser Jr. To
support that team, Valvoline is running a sweepstakes that
awards free trips to next year's Indy 500.
   Anheuser-Busch is trying to use its clout as a heavy
advertiser to "keep the cash payments {to teams} in line,"
says Mark Lamping, director of sports marketing. "We have to
be careful we don't reach a point where you price yourself
out of a sponsorship."
   Already some companies have bailed out. Quaker Oats Co.'s
Gatorade unit doesn't sponsor a car in Nascar, the stock-car
circuit, anymore. Instead, it awards prize money to drivers
at a variety of races. This year Stroh Brewery Co. won't be a
sponsor of any national events, just a few minor regional
races. Quaker State has reduced its sponsorships, too.
   Even some of the nontraditional sponsors who signed up in
the early 1980s are rethinking the costs. Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.'s Crisco shortening had sponsored a car in Nascar races
since 1986, but it discontinued the program this year. The
consumer products company is also reviewing its contract on
its Secret deodorant car in the Trans Am circuit. "These
programs are very expensive," a P&amp;G spokeswoman says. "Other
programs are more cost effective" for Secret. For instance,
P&amp;G says it's "very happy" with the brand's sponsorship of
women's golf tournaments. (P&amp;G's Tide and Folgers brands
still sponsor race cars.)
   Race organizers say there's always turnover among
sponsors. "There are fewer players qualified from a budget
standpoint, but there's not a shortage of people who want to
get in," says William Stokkan, Cart's chairman-elect, who
plans to recruit more international brands as sponsors.
   Team owners say some sponsors don't know how to make the
most of their investment. "You can't go in, give a million
dollars and not take advantage of it," says Rick Galles,
co-chairman of Galles Kraco Racing, which has been racing at
Indy since 1983. Mr. Galles recommends heavy promotional
tie-ins.
   He does concede there's a danger in the rising costs.
"We've got to do more things that will raise income for the
team, but not increase the costs to the point where the
sponsors will get out," Mr. Galles says. He suggests more
merchandising, such as a line of clothing endorsed by
drivers, or more world-wide television packages.
   One solution seen by many sponsors such as Valvoline is to
spend more money at small local tracks where racing is still
valued more for sport than for big business. "That's where
the Valvoline brand evolved," says Mr. Barr.
   It may be too late for even that. Genesee Corp., a
Rochester, N.Y., beer maker, says it can no longer afford to
sponsor racing at the local track in Watkins Glen, N.Y.
"They've gotten spoiled by the large checks," a spokesman
says. "What we did for a couple cases of beer and a paint
job, they now want $25,000."
