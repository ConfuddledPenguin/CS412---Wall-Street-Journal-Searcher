   Investing in Spinoffs
   Offers an Advantage

   VENTURE capitalists seeking safer investments may have
more corporate spinoffs to consider.
   Elron Electric Industries Ltd. says it is negotiating to
raise $14 million from international venture funds to finance
some small high-tech companies and projects it has been
developing in the U.S. to spin off.
   The companies include Rosh Intelligent Systems Inc., a
Needham, Mass., designer of artificial intelligence software,
and Chip Express Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif., start-up
planning to exploit chip design technology developed by
Elron, a holding company based in Haifa, Israel.
   The capital will "ensure the continued funding of these
ventures and also allow investments in newer projects," says
Uzia Galil, Elron's chairman.
   Companies are turning to spinoffs because they make sense
for both sides. Corporations get a new source of equity and
the investor gets a safer investment. The parent company has
already paid for most of the research, development and
testing, says Mark Radtke of Advent International, a Boston
venture-capital firm. "The technology and financing risks
have been drastically reduced. You can see what you're paying
for."
   Advent recently invested in Biotage Inc. of
Charlottesville, Va., an Aluminum Co. of America Inc. spinoff
that makes equipment for pharmaceutical and biochemical
companies. "We felt the technology could be better brought to
market by an independent company that focused solely on this
business," Mr. Radtke says.
                                                                                                       

   Magnetic Cards Attract
   Small-Business Owners
                                                                                                       

   SMALL COMPANIES are charging into the magnetic card
business.
   Payment Systems Development Corp. of Fairfax, Va., is
launching a prepaid electronic card allowing users to make
purchases at specially equipped vending machines and
fast-food outlets. The credited amount is paid in advance;
the balance decreases as purchases are made.
   The card's users -- initially University of Maryland
students and professors -- get discounts from some vendors,
as well as credit-card convenience.
   "The business already has proven itself in France and
Japan," says Greg Gregory, president of Payment Systems.
   Smart Card Solutions Inc., Atlanta, is introducing its
version of a card for Murray State University in Murray, Ky.
   Sophisticated magnetic cards in combination with advanced
data-processing techniques are providing other business
opportunities for small firms.
   In Sarasota, Fla., Automated Shipping Machines Inc. has a
machine allowing consumers to ship letters and packages
without having to trudge to a remote shipping outlet or post
office. Users choose how fast to have a package delivered and
get their magnetic credit cards to charge the transaction.
The machine dials the card issuer for authorization,
processes the transaction and calls the appropriate shipper
to arrange the pickup.
                                                                                                       

   Recession Is Unlikely,
   Entrepreneurs Say
                                                                                                       

   SMALL COMPANIES -- which are believed to be most sensitive
to economic shifts -- don't see a recession looming.
   More than 55% of small-company owners surveyed by Cicco &amp;
Associates Inc., a Murrysville, Pa., consulting group, say
they don't expect a recession within the next 12 months.
   Nearly 30% say they expect some sort of recession, and
about 15% say they are uncertain.
   "It looks like the strength of the economy is running
deeper than previously thought," says John Cicco Jr.,
president of the consulting concern. "If a recession is
coming, small companies aren't picking it up."
   But two groups are significantly less optimistic than
others: owners of companies with 20 or fewer employees, and
female owners. Both were evenly split on the likelihood of a
recession.
   The survey also indicates where small companies would cut
spending in case of a recession: Of 14 industries that serve
small businesses, the hotel and investment industries would
be the most affected, followed by the office equipment,
credit card, airline, car rental, telecommunications and
advertising industries. Accounting firms would feel the least
effect.
                                                                                                       

   Two Executive `Clubs'
   Stop Their Wrangling
                                                                                                       

   THE END has come for a squabble between two national
associations of small-company executives.
   Officials of the two New York groups -- the American
Management Association and the Center for Entrepreneurial
Management Inc. -- say they settled a legal tussle over a
membership list. Last year, giant AMA sued tiny CEM in a
local state court to bar it from alleged wrongful use of the
list naming 2,000 executives in the AMA presidents group.
CEM, formerly part of AMA, has 350 members in its Chief
Executive Officers Club. The court had temporarily banned CEM
from using any confidential list or trade secret of AMA. CEM
then filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code to
protect itself against further legal costs.
   But AMA drew criticism for its legal attack. Daniel
Pecora, president of a Chicago brush company, says: "I don't
see the need for a big organization to stomp on a small
organization." He got out of the AMA. Thomas Horton, AMA's
chairman, concedes some members deserted over the issue.
   Joseph Mancuso, CEM's president, says his group expects to
emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings now that the dispute has
been resolved. Mr. Mancuso denies any wrongdoing by CEM.
