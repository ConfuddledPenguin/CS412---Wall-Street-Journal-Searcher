   CARMEL, Calif. -- Landmark Land Co. said the Office of
Thrift Supervision is objecting to its plans for financing
the sale of a major part of its real estate and resort
holdings for nearly $1 billion.
   The move casts doubt upon nearly $500 million in expected
pretax profit from the proposed transaction.

   The planned sale of the company's premier golf, tennis and
development properties to California developer Barry G. Hon
for $967 million called for Landmark's Oak Tree Savings Bank
unit to finance the sale.
   However, in a supervisory objection letter the agency
expressed "concern we'd have too high a percentage of our
assets, about 20%, tied up in one borrower," said Gerland G.
Barton, Landmark's president. "I'm surprised, since we're
getting about 25% down and we'd have a first mortgage on the
property," Mr. Barton added.
   Landmark and Mr. Hon are attempting to restructure the
proposed transaction to address the agency's concerns.
   Inability to recast the deal to the agency's satisfaction
would kill the sale, Landmark said, and cancel out an
expected $470 million in pretax profit that would have
resulted from closing the transaction.
   Moreover, Landmark said it had hoped the sale would help
it satisfy all capital requirements of the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act.
   Landmark's Mr. Barton said Mr. Hon, the owner of Hon
Development Co., of Laguna Hills, Calif., was seeking
alternative financing for the planned purchase. He "is coming
back with a proposal he anticipates will be acceptable," he
said.
