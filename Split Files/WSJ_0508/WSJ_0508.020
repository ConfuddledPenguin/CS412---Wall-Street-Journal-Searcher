   The time has come for full-time mothers to go on the
offensive. That is the lesson of the student protest
(ironically, just in time for Mother's Day) against Barbara
Bush's invitation to speak at this year's Wellesley
commencement.
   The Wellesley protesters are angry for two reasons. First,
they believe that Mrs. Bush was invited only because her
husband is the president of the U.S. Second, they apparently
do not consider Mrs. Bush a suitable role model for young
women because she has not pursued a career of the sort to
which most Wellesley women no doubt aspire.

   Both of these are bad arguments. The first objection
assumes that because Barbara Bush's husband is more famous
than she is, she cannot be an interesting and important and
appealing person in her own right -- that she must be a mere
appendage. With the second objection, the Wellesley
protesters are endorsing the view that if a woman puts her
children first, she is all but wasting her life.
   I can attest that Wellesley women are not alone in their
disdain for women who choose to care for their children
full-time. I am the product of an exclusive and expensive
education -- Barnard College and Yale Law School -- and I
have done my time in the practice of law. My husband is a law
professor, and we have two children. For the past three
years, I have chosen to devote all my time to the care of our
children and community service.
   At gatherings of professionals, the flow of conversation
seems directed around rather than toward women who make the
choice that I have. Their husbands are evidently fascinating
people -- they have "real" careers -- but those women who
devote their time to their children are all too often met
with little more than an "Oh, that's nice."
   And yet, when my husband took a semester and a summer to
be at home full time with our first child, his decision was
greeted with admiration and respect. His time was not being
wasted; he was not boring. It was oh, so wonderful, this man
at home with a child in the Connecticut suburbs while his
wife commuted to New York to pursue her career. And as I
think about the Wellesley protest, I cannot help wondering
whether a man who made the choice to stay at home and care
for his children would be acceptable to Wellesley students as
a graduation speaker.
   I suspect that he would, and if I am right, then the
Wellesley protest amounts to discrimination against women by
women. Only men are to be free to make the lifestyle choice
to stay at home and raise children without being criticized,
trivialized and marginalized. If women do it, they are poor
role models who are betraying the forces of progress.
   This says little that is good about the Wellesley
students' understanding of feminism, an ideology I had always
thought was supposed to enhance women's choices. It says even
less that is good about the value that some future leaders of
America who happen to be women place on child care as an
activity and on children themselves.
   According to the Wellesley protesters, caring for children
is not an important enough endeavor for those of us who have
had the best education money can buy to spend much time on
it. Our talents are not appreciated or valued unless we apply
them outside of the home.
   But no one deserves the benefits of our talents more than
our children do. It is our job to be forceful advocates for
our children and for our right to care for them free from
pressure to conform to someone else's vision of how women
ought to do.
   Like most college seniors about to embark on a journey
through real life, the Wellesley protesters have a lot to
learn. Mrs. Bush could teach them something about the dignity
that can come from being comfortable with one's self and the
choices that one makes. In time the students will learn even
more than that: that there can be value in giving and that
there is great value in working for children. The Wellesley
protest shows little respect for those of us who have made
and acted on the free and open decision that nothing is more
important to us than our children. And it is those children
finally that the Wellesley protest devalues.
