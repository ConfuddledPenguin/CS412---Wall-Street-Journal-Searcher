   WHO AND THE PLO

   The World Health Organization began its annual meeting
yesterday in Geneva facing fresh controversy over moves by
the Palestinian Liberation Organization to gain membership.
   Fathi Arafat, brother of PLO leader Yasser Arafat, will
spearhead new PLO efforts to secure an upgrading of its
present observer status to full membership in the 167-nation
health group. Fathi Arafat, head of the Palestinian Red
Crescent volunteer emergency health service, attended the
opening session of the two-week World Health Assembly.
   The U.S., which provides over a quarter of WHO's annual
budget, has threatened to stop its contributions if the PLO
bid, due for discussion Thursday, is successful. A similar
bid last year failed following strong Washington opposition.
   China's Health Minister Chen Minzhang told the opening
session that global economic problems threatened the health
of large population groups. "In many countries there have
been cuts in health budgets and living standards have
deteriorated," said Mr. Chen, the assembly's outgoing
chairman.
                                                                                                       

   UNDELIVERED GERMAN MAIL
                                                                                                       

   Strikes at West Germany's post office and printing presses
spread yesterday, leaving mail boxes empty, telephone offices
abandoned and many newspapers cut down to skeleton editions.
More than 10,000 postal workers are on strike across the
country to back demands that their hourly work break should
be extended from six to 10 minutes. The strike started last
week. In Hamburg alone, a quarter of a million letters were
left undelivered, the postal workers' union said.
                                                                                                       

   SAVING PERU'S TREASURES
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. has barred importation of archaeological
treasures from Peru in a bid to cut into the illegal sale of
such artifacts, the White House announced. "The United States
believes that the illegal trade in cultural property does
immense damage to our hemispheric cultural heritage," White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He said the ban was
imposed to help curb looting in the Sipan region of Peru,
following a request from the Lima government.
                                                                                                       

   SETBACK FOR ITALY'S COMMUNISTS
                                                                                                       

   The Italian Communist Party suffered a severe setback in
regional elections, its first nationwide test since the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Early projections
showed the party's vote falling to 23.5% in the elections
Sunday and yesterday -- its worst showing for more than 30
years -- from 28.6% during European elections last year and
30.2% in the last regional election in 1985.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ZEALAND MERGER
                                                                                                       

   MCI Communications Corp. of the U.S. and Bell Canada
Enterprises Inc. are merging their New Zealand
telecommunications joint ventures. Last year, MCI formed a
company with New Zealand Railways Corp. and Todd Corp., a
closely held industrial and investment concern. Bell Canada's
Bell Canada International unit set up a separate venture with
Television New Zealand. The new companies were formed after
New Zealand deregulated the telecommunications market to
allow competition with Telecom Corp., the state-owned
telephone company. The government is selling Telecom as part
of a program to raise funds to repay debt.
                                                                                                       

   TURKEY ABANDONS A PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   Turkey abandoned a plan for a Japanese-led consortium to
build a $1 billion thermal-power plant on the Aegean coast.
Turkish enviromentalists had actively opposed the project
since last October, when the consortium was awarded a
contract to build the 1,000-megawatt plant in Aliaga. The
consortium was led by Japan's Electric Power Development Co.
and also included Turkey's state-owned Electricity Authority.
Yesterday's decision came after a major demonstration by
environmentalists in Aliaga.
                                                                                                       

   HONG KONG'S CAPITAL OUTFLOW
                                                                                                       

   Hong Kong's capital outflow surged after the bloodshed in
Beijing June 4, to 22.39 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$2.87
billion) for 1989, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
estimated.
   If that rate persists, local economic growth will be
slowed, the bank said in its April economic report. The bank,
Hong Kong's largest, said there has been mild private capital
outflow since 1984 but that it picked up significantly after
Beijing's bloody suppression of the Chinese pro-democracy
movement last June.
   The bank estimated 1988's outflow to be around HK$2.034
billion and put 1984's at HK$8.949 billion.
   The bank concluded that before the local confidence crisis
is resolved, the capital flight will continue and the
draining of funds from the local economy will continue to
hamper growth.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   West German Nazi-hunters paid $310,000 for information
that led to the capture of Josef Schwammberger, who was
brought back to Germany from Argentina last week and faces
trial on charges of murdering Jews at several camps in
Poland. The bounty, paid to an anonymous informer, is said to
be a record. . . . Two Norwegian skiers reached the North
Pole last weekend after a 500-mile trek that was the first
without dogs, motorized vehicles, or supplies delivered en
route, Norwegian news reports said. Their trip began March 8.
