   Immunex Corp. said one-time licensing and option fees from
two major business partners boosted the company to a
first-quarter profit of $5.1 millon, or 54 cents a share.
   The Seattle-based biotechnology concern recorded a
year-ago loss of $1.1 million, or 14 cents a share.
First-quarter revenue more than doubled to $15.3 million,
from $6.9 million.

   The performance resulted largely from the repurchase by
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of an Immmunex option to manufacture
the protein IL-2 for sale by Roche in the U.S. Immunex also
cited the licensing by Behringwerke AG of manufacturing and
marketing rights in Japan to a package of Immunex receptor
products.
   In addition, Immunex said, first-quarter performance
improved due to an increase in sales to collaborators of
products for clinical trials. The products were
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and
interleukin-4.
   Stephen A. Duzan, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that despite the quarterly profit, the company expects
to record a loss for the 1990 year due to planned increases
in spending for scientific, clinical and marketing
activities.
