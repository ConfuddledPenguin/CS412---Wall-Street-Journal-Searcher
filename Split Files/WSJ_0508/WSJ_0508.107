   LOS ANGELES -- H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent company of Home
Savings of America, said it has reduced its recourse
liability on $6.2 billion of mortgage loans it previously
sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association.
   The recourse provision required Ahmanson to compensate the
mortgage agency if certain losses occurred from foreclosures.
The affected mortgages had to be backed by more capital under
a risk-based weighting used by regulators. Ahmanson removed
the recourse provision by buying financial guarantees to
replace its obligation to Fannie Mae. The move comes as part
of the thrift holding company's program to increase its
capital ratios as required by federal regulations governing
the operations of the nation's thrifts.

   "Home Savings of America exceeds by an ample margin all
current capital requirements imposed by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989
(FIRREA)," said Richard A. Diehl, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   He added that along with the company's acquisition of Home
Savings Bank of New York, the action will help the company
meet the new regulation's fully phased-in capital requirement
as soon as possible.
   Effective with the reduction of recourse liability, Home
Savings' risk-based capital ratio will increase to 7.57% from
7.11%, effective with the move. Its tangible capital ratio
remains unchanged at 3.51%, and its core capital ratio
remains at 4.37%.
