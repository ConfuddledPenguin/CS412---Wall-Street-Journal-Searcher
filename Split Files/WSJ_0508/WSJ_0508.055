   FINDLAY, Ohio -- New York investor Carl Icahn lost his bid
to force USX Corp. out of steel. But the bitter battle
ultimately may prod the company to sell at least part of the
core business.
   Mr. Icahn's failure to win enough support for his plan to
spin off at least 80% of USX's steel business means the
company will remain for now the nation's largest steelmaker.
But the proxy battle, which culminated with yesterday's vote
by USX shareholders here, also gave management an earful of
shareholder dissatisfaction.

   "As shareholders, we're the owners of USX. Let's start
acting like them," said a disgruntled Nick Rossi, whose
family holds 3,250 shares and supported Mr. Icahn's plan.
   Even holders who voted with management voiced concern over
what they consider to be a lackluster value for USX shares.
As a result, the proxy battle has increased the likelihood
that at some point in the next few years USX will take steps
leading to the partial or full divestiture of steel, a
business the company virtually founded with its creation in
1901 by J.P. Morgan.
   Recent "strategy has always been to do something with the
steel business," said one director. "I think something will
happen there." During the roughly two-hour meeting at
Findlay's Central Junior High School Auditorium, USX Chairman
Charles A. Corry said: "This is a corporation that has
changed and will continue to change. That is inevitable."
   Although the final tally won't be known for at least
several days, people on both sides of the contest indicated
privately that the outcome was not in doubt and that the
proposal had been defeated.
   Mr. Icahn said he had no more than about 80 million
certain shares, including his own 34 million backing his
proposal. That represents only about 40% of the 200 million
or so shares that were expected to be cast, indicating that
no more than one in three shares other than his own endorsed
the spinoff of steel.
   "Whether we win or lose, we have made a statement here. A
lot of shareholders have spoken," Mr. Icahn said. He said
that he had apparently lost the support of five or six "key"
institutions that had voted with management, but only after
some had written to Mr. Corry urging major changes at the
company.
   The investor, who has been a USX shareholder since 1986
and owns 13.3% of the company, vowed to retain his holding
until the stock value appreciates. He said yesterday's vote
wouldn't be his "last stand."
   Ever since USX -- then U.S. Steel Corp. -- got into the
energy business with its purchase in 1982 of Marathon Oil,
based here, the issue of USX's stock valuation has dogged
management. Pittsburgh-based USX paid $5.8 billion, and for
several years after the market value for both Marathon and
its steel business was considerably less than the purchase
price. That undervaluation drew Mr. Icahn to invest in the
company and agitate for higher values.
   His on-again, off-again battle with USX management
climaxed March 8, when management agreed to submit to
shareholders his non-binding proposal to spin off the steel
business as a special dividend. Mr. Icahn contended that
doing so would increase the value of USX stock to $48 a
share, with Marathon alone valued at $39 a share and U.S.
Steel at $9. USX stock fell 50 cents yesterday to close at
$33.50 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   At the heart of his unprecedented shareholder resolution
is the future of the steel business. Mr. Icahn argued that
the profits and cash flow of Marathon propped up what is an
inherently labor-intensive and capital-draining steel
segment.
   "Why should we jeopardize the future of the oil business?"
Mr. Icahn asked the roughly 600 shareholders who attended the
meeting. He likened it to asking the smartest child in a farm
family to work in the fields rather than go to medical or law
school.
   Mr. Icahn argued that even the much-improved USX steel
business -- bolstered in recent years through the shutdown of
unprofitable facilities and the furlough of tens of thousands
of steelworkers -- effectively acts as a "poison pill." He
said potential buyers of Marathon's lucrative oil assets
wouldn't touch USX because of past and future liabilities
related to its steel business.
   In fact, he believes Marathon Oil alone would trade higher
than USX's current trading value. "The North Sea {where
Marathon has extensive holdings} would be a dream come true
to some of these foreigners," Mr. Icahn said. He refused,
though, to identify any potential buyers who, he asserted,
approached him.
   It was the prospect of Marathon's strength to counter
steel's down cycle that initially attracted management. That
was in 1982, ironically the last time USX and Marathon
brought shareholders together here.
   USX apparently convinced the bulk of shareholders that its
strategy of having two businesses complement each other
proved correct in recent years, when steel operations
outperformed Marathon Oil, hurt by low crude-oil prices. The
company also apparently persuaded shareholders that splitting
the two businesses would only increase costs by creating more
administrative, insurance, and borrowing expenses, and
wouldn't add more than $10 a share to USX's stock price, as
Mr. Icahn suggested.
   But perhaps the most convincing argument that USX put
forward was that its management isn't opposed to change and
would continue its current program of selling assets to
reduce debt and buy back stock. W. Bruce Thomas, USX vice
chairman-administration and chief financial officer, said
investors seem to back that program and haven't indicated a
clear mandate to change that direction. Mr. Thomas has also
said the company considered as recently as 1988 selling about
20% of the steel business to the public in a stock offering,
and that management would likely revisit that proposal when
the steel market rebounds, possibly within two or three
years.
   While Mr. Corry was cautious not to predict the outcome of
the vote, he said he felt the company was "successful
generally" in arguing against the spinoff. "The board and
management will do all we can to reshape the company
intelligently and in a constructive manner based on the
interest of all shareholders," Mr. Corry said.
   However, one area that apparently hasn't gone as well as
planned is the sale of USX's Texas Oil &amp; Gas reserves. Mr.
Corry had hoped to sell those reserves for about $1.5 billion
in the first quarter. But the reserves couldn't be sold in
one piece and had to be parceled. And some of the parcels
failed to attract a premium price and will be retained for
now.
