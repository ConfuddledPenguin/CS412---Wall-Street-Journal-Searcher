   Ameritech, emerging from a recent restructuring program,
plans to concentrate on developing international markets and
expanding non-telephone operations.
   "We've been looking for growth opportunities . . . and
domestically, current restrictions limit us," said William L.
Weiss, chairman and chief executive officer. "We're looking
carefully in all parts of the world to take our skills and
find opportunities to grow."

   The Chicago-based Bell company is getting a late start.
The six other regional Bell companies already have developed
substantial business operations overseas.
   "It wasn't that we were afraid to move out," explained Mr.
Weiss in an interview. "But, we stayed because the core
business is very good."
   Ameritech now views foreign countries as untapped markets
for all its services, particularly telephone, cellular and
information service. The company currently is concentrating
on the Eastern Bloc countries, Europe and Latin America for
various telecommunications opportunities.
   Recently, Ameritech competed for a cellular franchise in
West Germany and a Mexican system, although unsuccessfully.
"We competed very aggressively for the German cellular system
and we came within a hair's breadth. We will continue to
compete as various opportunities come up," Mr. Weiss said,
adding that Ameritech's cash flow is in a very "good
position."
   At the end of last year, Ameritech had $520.2 million in
cash and temporary cash investments. Total assets were $2.8
billion and cash flow totaled $3.1 billion.
   Ameritech's cellular and telephone units are "very active"
in looking for opportunites in international markets. Bruce
DeMaeyer, president of Ameritech Mobile Communications Inc.,
said the unit is discussing the possibility of cellular in
New Zealand and Australia.
   On the domestic front, Ameritech is launching aggressive
plans to build rings of fiber-optic cable in major
metropolitan areas in its five-state territory.
   Robert L. Barnett, president of the Ameritech Bell Group,
said the company initially plans to invest $100 million to
build the rings in Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee,
Indianapolis, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Mich., and Columbus,
Ohio. To date, Ameritech has installed more than 230,000
miles of fiber.
   "Fiber rings should be set within the next 12 months,"
said Mr. Barnett, conceding that "part of our plan to build
these fiber rings is in response to competition."
   Ameritech and other regional telephone companies have been
losing important chunks of corporate business to fiber-optic
upstart companies, which are building optical-fiber networks
in almost every major U.S. urban hub.
   Mr. Barnett said the company's telephone business is
growing overall at a healthy rate. He said television and
radio campaigns marketing additional phone lines are believed
to have resulted in increased customer-line growth. Phone
lines had been growing in the 2% range, but last year
increased 2.9%.
   He expects the marketing campaign and other factors to
increase phone lines at least 2.9% this year. At the end of
1989, the company had 15.8 million customer lines.
   Minutes of access use are expected to increase at least
5%. Minutes of use last year totaled 43.6 billion. Toll
messages, which numbered 1.4 billion, should grow between 6%
and 10%.
   Telephone operations also should begin to benefit from new
regulatory programs and cost-cutting measures. Illinois and
Michigan have adopted "incentive" regulatory plans that
should give the company greater earnings flexibility.
Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana are looking at similar
arrangements.
   In addition, the company is paring its telephone work
force and consolidating operations. At the end of 1989, about
850 manager positions were eliminated in Michigan. The
company this year has cut 1,300 slots in Illinois and
Michigan and will be slashing an additional 700 positions
when it consolidates 14 data centers, which house mainframe
computers, to four regional branches.
   "We expect to see some substantial savings in labor
costs," Mr. Barnett said.
   Separately, revenue from non-telephone operations is
expected to grow about 10% to 15% over the next few years.
Last year, non-telephone revenue was $1.1 billion, or 10% of
total revenue.
   Cellular operations, one of the largest contributors in
the group, continue to grow at a robust pace. New cellular
customers, which numbered 242,000 in 1989, are expected to
increase 50% this year. In addition, William P. Vititoe,
president of the Ameritech Enterprise Group, said Ameritech
is shopping for acquisitions to bolster the cellular division
in the five-state territory.
   Ameritech's Tigon unit, which provides voice-messaging
services to corporations, is experiencing 40% growth in new
customers and now is looking into opportunities in the
residential and small-business markets.
