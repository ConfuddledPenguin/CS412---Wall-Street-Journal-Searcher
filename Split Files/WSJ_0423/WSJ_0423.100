   CINCINNATI -- Omnicare Inc. said it has decided to sell
its disappointing medical and industrial oxygen business,
resulting in a first-quarter charge of $2.5 million, or 28
cents a share.
   The health care company said it's negotiating to sell a
major portion of the assets of its Bunn/Xorbox Group, which
had an operating loss in the first quarter of $341,000, or
four cents a share. Those operations were classified as
discontinued in the latest quarter.

   The company reported a net loss of $2.2 million, or 25
cents a share, including the charge and loss from
discontinued operations. Profit from continuing operations
totaled $624,000 in the latest quarter.
   In the year-ago first quarter, the company earned
$973,000, or 10 cents a share. Last year's results include
profit from discontinued operations of $410,000, from the
company's hospital pharmacy management business, which was
sold in August 1989.
