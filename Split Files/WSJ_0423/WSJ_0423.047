   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Tourists are returning to Sri
Lanka's palm-fringed beaches and foreign investment is rising
as this island nation cautiously climbs out of seven years of
ethnic violence.
   The foreign investment, bedrock of the island economy, is
on the upswing with the apparent end of armed rebellions by
Sinhalese nationalists and Tamil separatists.

   And the return of the tourists to its Indian Ocean resorts
has triggered hope of a rebound in the largest foreign
exchange earning industry, which has been slumping after
seasons of empty hotel rooms.
   "There has been an economic turnaround," said Neelan
Tiruchelvam, a lawyer and respected political analyst. "The
balance of payments has improved considerably and the stock
market is buoyant."
   The Colombo Stock Exchange reported April 12 that its
all-share index had reached 326, its highest level ever. The
index has risen 154.5 points since the beginning of the year.
   There were no official figures for the country's balance
of payments, which reached a staggering 5.8 billion-rupee
($146.2 million) deficit for the first six months of 1989.
   But analysts say the deficit had been curtailed by
increased remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad, better
trade and an increase in the prices of tea, one of the
country's principal exports.
   Last year, an uprising by Sinhalese extremists derailed
the country's economy. Officials and diplomats agree
privately that the government of President Ranasinghe
Premadasa was close to being overthrown before a wave of
reprisal killings crushed the militants.
   The government said strikes and attacks on economic
targets by militants of the pro-Sinhalese People's Liberation
Front cost Sri Lanka at least 14 billion rupees, or 5.5% of
its gross domestic product.
   The north and east of the nation, dominated by the Tamil
minority, appears to be shrugging off the effects of a
seven-year war for independence by Tamil rebels.
   The militants and the government agreed to a cease-fire
last summer, and the guerrillas almost immediately began
speaking of plans to put the region's mostly agricultural
economy back on its feet.
   Revenue was lost because the rebellions frightened off
tourists and investors.
   "We were beginning to worry," said Terrence S. Coldham,
managing director of Nunan Sapphire Ltd., an Australian
mining firm that is setting up a sapphire processing plant
with an investment of $455,000.
   "Our commitment in Sri Lanka hadn't changed either way,
but we were afraid we wouldn't succeed," he said.
   But now, Mr. Coldham said, the situation on the island has
undergone a vast change. "The improvement in the whole
country is fantastic," he said. "It's in the air. Even the
streets are cleaner."
   "We get about 20 inquiries a day," said Bandula Fernando,
a senior executive in the Greater Colombo Economic
Commission, the regulatory body for foreign investment in Sri
Lanka. "Of course, very few translate into projects, but the
interest is tremendous."
   Mr. Fernando said the major attractions for a foreign
investor were the low cost of labor, the wide use of English
and Sri Lanka's location on major sea routes linking
Southeast Asia with the West.
   "Ultimately the investor decides on his balance sheet, so
we are trying to give him all the incentives we can," he
said.
