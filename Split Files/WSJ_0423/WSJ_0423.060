   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank said it approved
a $13.1 million direct loan to finance equipment for a pulp
and paper mill project in Thailand.
   In 1987, the Ex-Im Bank approved a $62 million loan for
the same project.

   The new loan will cover 85% of the cost of paper-handling
equipment to be supplied to Panjapol Paper Industry Co., by
Black Clawson Co., Middletown, Ohio, and other U.S.
companies. The $226 million paper mill project is being
engineered by Beloit Corp., of Beloit, Wis. The plant is
slated for completion in December 1992.
