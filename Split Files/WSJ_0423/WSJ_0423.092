   LONDON -- As a specialist in bailing out problem
companies, David James is used to looking for trouble. On the
morning of March 27, he knew he'd found it.
   Mr. James, chairman of U.K. conglomerate Eagle Trust PLC,
phoned Peter Mitchell, the manager of his company's
engineering unit. "He sounded odd," recalls Mr. James. "I
said, `Are you all right, Peter?'" His employee replied: "A
chap called Gerald Bull has been murdered. His company is
handling our orders to Iraq."

   "Jesus Christ]" Mr. James responded.
   Mr. James knew from media reports that Mr. Bull was an
American ballistics expert with strong ties to the arms trade
-- a man described by colleagues as both a dark genius in the
mold of Dr. Strangelove and a meek, rumpled theorist with
space-age dreams. For 30 years, he had collaborated on
advanced weapons research with the U.S., South Africa,
Israel, China and most recently, Iraq.
   What Mr. James says he hadn't realized was that his own
company had become an unwitting player in Mr. Bull's global
arms game. British officials confirmed Mr. James's fears last
week, announcing that huge steel tubes supplied by British
manufacturers -- ostensibly for an Iraqi petrochemical
project -- were in fact pieces of the world's biggest gun.
   Police are still searching for the professional killer who
used a silenced pistol to shoot Mr. Bull five times outside
his Brussels apartment. Robbery has been ruled out as a
motive; the scientist was found carrying $20,000. Seizing
steel pipes still on British docks and stopping trucks in
Greece and near Turkey's border with Iraq, British officials
appear to have stymied Mr. Bull's grand project.
   But while the scientist and his "supergun" dream are gone,
Mr. Bull's death leaves a trail of mystery and military
debris stretching from an abandoned missile range in Vermont
to the arid hills of Iraq. Arms experts are baffled by the
precise purpose and workings of Mr. Bull's "Doomsday Gun."
Strong evidence suggests that Margaret Thatcher's government
winked at the gun's manufacture, breaking its own rules on
weapons shipments. And there is widespread suspicion that
agents for Israel, or possibly Iran, killed Mr. Bull.
   "The only man with the answers was last seen with five
bullets in his head and his pockets stuffed with cash," says
Christopher Foss, a U.K. weapons expert and military editor
of Jane's Defense Weekly.
   The strange career of Mr. Bull was as fast and high-flying
as the weapons he created. Born in Ontario in 1928, he became
at the age of 20 one of Canada's youngest-ever Ph.D.
graduates. Four years later, Maclean's magazine dubbed him
Canada's "Boy Rocket Scientist." In 1966, Mr. Bull's work on
a joint U.S.-Canadian ballistics project lofted him into the
Guinness Book of World Records, which cites the High Altitude
Research Project (HARP) for "the greatest range ever attained
by a gun." The 112 mile-high firing hasn't been surpassed.
Mr. Bull's work was considered so vital that Sen. Barry
Goldwater helped push through a special act of Congress to
grant U.S. citizenship to the Canadian.
   "He was a very intense, very charismatic, very charming
person," says Charles Murphy, who worked with Mr. Bull on
HARP and is now chief of the launch and flight division of
the U.S. Army's ballistic research laboratory at Aberdeen,
Md. He was a "von Braun type, who would work for anybody,"
says Mr. Murphy, noting that Wernher von Braun worked on
rocket programs for the Germans during World War II and later
for the Americans to achieve his goal of sending a rocket to
the moon. Mr. Bull's dream was to use guns rather than
rockets to launch payloads cheaply into space.
   The stocky, temperamental scientist's obsession with his
space gun -- and his willingness to work with anybody --
eventually got him into trouble. The U.S. and Canada cut
funding for HARP in the late 1960s, in part because of a
decision to pursue conventional rocketry. Embittered, Mr.
Bull continued testing at a missile range straddling the
Vermont-Quebec border, with venture capital provided by
Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman, and the
Boston-based research and consulting firm Arthur D. Little.
The occasional cannon blasts "sounded like a little
roadwork," recalls Harold Haynes, a real-estate agent in
North Troy, Vt.
   To the South Africans and Israelis, it sounded like a
promising way to boost the range and accuracy of their field
artillery. In the 1970s, the Israelis integrated his research
into their own designs, which had proved inferior in the 1973
Yom Kippur War. South Africa brought Mr. Bull to Pretoria to
help develop a new cannon. The G5 howitzer is still
considered the world's best and proved decisive during
fighting in Angola, as well as becoming a major export earner
for South Africa.
   "Bull was a man who could carry around all these intricate
calculations in his brain -- just the man we were after,"
says Piet Marais, who met often with Mr. Bull as head of the
Armaments Corp. of South Africa, a government agency. He
remembers the scientist as an "absent-minded professor" who
had "absolutely no ability at managing a business or actually
putting his theories into practice."
   Mr. Marais says the South Africans often advanced Mr. Bull
money to overcome personal financial problems. They also
listened politely to "his endless fantasies about big guns.
You could only use 25% of what he said. The rest was dreams."
His biggest vision: a giant gun that could destroy satellites
by exploding projectiles in their path. From what he's heard
of the Iraqi supergun, Mr. Marais says, "it sounds like Gerry
Bull never let go of his dream."
   In 1980, Mr. Bull pleaded guilty in a federal court in
Vermont to smuggling arms, shells and testing equipment to
South Africa between 1976 and 1978. The material was acquired
from the U.S. Army under the authority of a letter from the
State Department's Office of Munitions Control, and
intermediaries in the deal included an agent of the Central
Intelligence Agency and a state-owned Israeli weapons
producer. From congressional inquiries and the accounts of
Mr. Bull's colleagues, it appears that the scientist was
trying to finance his research through arms deals that he
thought had the tacit approval of the U.S.
   Before serving four months in a Pennsylvania prison, Mr.
Bull spent eight weeks in a Connecticut psychiatric facility.
"His world just collapsed on him," says Mr. Murphy, his HARP
colleague. "He had four or five companies that went down the
tubes."
   Mr. Bull's imprisonment intensified the disillusionment he
experienced after the abandonment of his HARP research.
Colleagues say the mild-mannered professor emerged from jail
an enraged man who felt he had been betrayed and made a
scapegoat. "I would call him two different people," says a
Montreal scientist who worked closely with Mr. Bull for many
years. "In the 60s his goal was scientific and technical. In
the later years it's hard to tell what was driving him --
revenge, bitterness."
   Released from prison, Mr. Bull set up shop in Belgium and
began peddling his expertise to anyone willing to bankroll
research and buy arms. He became scathingly critical of the
U.S., believing that it was on the wrong side in most of its
foreign policy, which he once reportedly termed "gutless and
confused." And increasingly, he turned to Third World clients
such as China and Iraq.
   Although the details of Mr. Bull's work with Baghdad
remain murky, he is believed to have helped Iraq develop
long-range artillery in the closing stages of its war with
Iran -- work which may have culminated in the launch last
December of a missile with a range of 1,200 miles. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein recently hailed Mr. Bull as a
scientist "sympathetic to Arab causes," adding cryptically
that he had "helped Iraq in one thing or another."
   The two men's interests meshed perfectly; Mr. Bull, with
his lifetime dream of a big gun, and Mr. Hussein, a dictator
with big bucks, a Babylon-sized ego and enemies on three
flanks: Iran, Israel and Syria. The world's biggest gun --
immobile, easy to spot and difficult to fire -- would
nonetheless represent another impressive arrow in Iraq's
bulging quiver.
   "If you're looking for a logical rationale here, I don't
think you're going to find it," says Martin Navias, an expert
in missile proliferation at King's College in London. He
says, though, that the development of such a weapon fits
"Iraq's shotgun approach to arming itself -- an `I'll try
anything' attitude."
   April 1988 was the turning point for Iraq in the long
Persian Gulf war, as Baghdad began to push the Iranians back
from territory they had earlier overrun. Meanwhile, far away
in the British midlands, independent steel companies such as
Eagle Trust's Walter Somers Ltd. unit were fighting battles
just to stay in business. It was also in April 1988, while
trying to drum up new contracts, that the company put an
advertisment in a trade magazine, Metals and Materials,
showing off its high-pressure presses.
   A response came almost immediately from a Brussels-based
businessman then working for Mr. Bull's Space Research Corp.
He told Somers that he wanted heavy-duty steel tubes for an
Iraqi petrochemicals plant. Somers didn't have the capacity
to fill the large order, so another plant, Sheffield
Forgemasters, took on the lion's share.
   In June, specifications for the tubes arrived, and Rex
Bayliss, then Somers's managing director, didn't like what he
saw. An expert metallurgist who had served in the Royal Navy
and filled numerous contracts for the British Ministry of
Defence, he felt that the toughness required in the steel
jibed more with military jobs than with a standard
oil-industry specification. British law bans arms sales to
Iraq and Iran and requires licensing for any "large calibre
armament" export.
   Mr. Bayliss called a local member of Parliament, Sir Hal
Miller, who immediately alerted the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Ministry of Defence and a third party, which he
identifies only as "a security agency." The company offered
three options: It would withdraw from the order, undertake it
and allow the pipes to be traced, or simply carry on. The
government said to go ahead.
   In 1989, the company received orders for hydraulic
equipment, supposedly destined for the same petrochemicals
plant. "No use was identified for it, but that isn't
unusual," says Mr. James, the Eagle Trust chairman.
"Engineers just work from specifications. If you gave them a
specification for a monster garden gnome, they'd fill the
spec," he says. Now, Mr. James thinks the equipment may have
been part of a gun's recoil mechanism.
   Late in 1989, Somers received inquiries about a metal
device capable of swinging a pipe through a wide arc. The
week of Mr. Bull's murder, the company got an urgent
communication from the Iraqis saying they wanted the new
device manufactured as soon as possible.
   In the wake of the killing, an alarmed Mr. James once
again outlined the company's concerns to the British
government. Two days later, customs officers raided the
premises of Somers and Sheffield Forgemasters, as part of
"Operation Bertha," named for the huge World War I guns used
by the Germans to shell Paris. British officials say 44 of
the 52 pipes ordered by Iraq already have been delivered. A
smaller-bore prototype of the supergun may have been
test-fired in Iraq, though officials are unsure which
countries have provided the breech and other parts.
   Sheffield Forgemasters never seems to have been troubled
by the doubts that beset Somers. The company continues to
assert that to the best of its knowledge, the pipes for Iraq
were to be used in making polyethylene. It even made a
15-minute promotional video entitled "Technology in Tube
Making" to show off its work on the giant pipes.
   Parliamentarians are now questioning whether Mrs.
Thatcher's government knowingly broke its own arms embargo.
Just as the U.S. government tilted toward Iraq in the final
stages of the war to fend off an Iranian victory, the British
government may have allowed the shipments to proceed as a
back-door way of helping Iraq's war effort. Now, with an
increasingly belligerent Mr. Hussein threatening to "scorch
half of Israel," shoring up Iraq's military with a giant gun
might not seem such a good idea.
   "There is no artillery piece in the world like this.
Period," says Mr. Foss at Jane's Defense Weekly. The
completed weapon would be 130 feet long with a barrel
diameter of 39 inches -- four to five times the size of any
gun in the arsenal of either NATO or the Warsaw Pact. It
could deliver conventional, chemical or nuclear warheads over
a distance of 1,000 miles, or possibly launch a satellite or
anti-satellite device into space.
   Mr. Foss, like most arms experts, isn't exactly sure how
the gun would be used, or whether it would work at all. But,
he adds: "Gerry Bull was a pioneer, and he came up with very
few losers."
   As it turned out, Mr. Bull never got the chance to see if
his supergun would have been a winner. On March 22, an
assassin shot him as he stood at the door of his apartment in
a fancy Brussels suburb. Neighbors heard nothing, and the
police don't appear to have any strong leads. Agents for
Israel, Iran or possibly Syria -- all foes of Iraq -- are the
leading suspects.
   Avraham Bar-David, an Israeli artillery specialist who met
several times with Mr. Bull while Israel was assessing the
scientist's work, expressed sadness but no surprise at news
of his death. "This is the way this business works," he says
of the scientist's turn to arms-dealing with the Arabs and
eventual assassination. He added that the murder was
undoubtedly "correlated to the Iraqi gun." As to allegations
by Mr. Bull's son that Israeli intelligence carried out the
killing, Mr. Bar-David responds: "Maybe he knows what he's
talking about. I don't know."
   Whoever the killer may be, the murder achieved its
apparent purpose of ending Mr. Bull's work. Last Thursday,
Space Research Corp. closed its doors, citing the death of
Mr. Bull and "security reasons." Company sources say every
engineer at the Brussels-based firm has received death
threats in recent weeks.
   Michael Bull, the scientist's son and a managing director
of the company, continues to deny any link to the Iraqi gun,
adding that the British are using the company as an "alibi"
in its anti-Iraq campaign. "We're just a little pawn in that
game," he fumed. "Our reputation has been tarnished by the
British in a disgusting way. They are the worst scum that
ever existed on earth."
   Iraq also continues to deny the existence of the supergun.
But by comparing calculations made by British officials with
those of Mr. Bull, the mysterious weapon bears a striking
resemblance to the one he began developing almost 30 years
ago.
   A piece of that dream can still be found in North Troy,
Vt., hard by the Canadian border, on the site of the missile
range Mr. Bull abandoned in 1980. A 106-foot-long cylinder
lies beside a snow-fed brook. Six smaller gun barrels are
strewn nearby, amid alder and scrub maple trees. All that
remains as evidence of its potentially deadly use is a faded
red sign warning: "Danger Explosif."
