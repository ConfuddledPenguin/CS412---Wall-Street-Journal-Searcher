   LISBON -- Portugal's center-right government has changed
its mind.
   After four years of boosting state spending to fuel fast
growth in one of Western Europe's poorest economies,
officials have decided it's better to be cautious than to
overspend.

   So they have begun to slash the nation's huge budget
deficit in an effort to curb inflation fast -- a move
prompted largely by pressures from the European Community's
steady move toward financial and monetary integration.
   Miguel Beleza, just four months at the helm of the Finance
Ministry, said Wednesday that as a first step he would cut 40
billion escudos ($270 million) from state spending budgeted
for this year -- and he warned there could be more cuts to
come. "It's time to demand some sacrifices from the public
sector in the name of the fight against inflation and of
European integration," said Mr. Beleza.
   The move comes amid growing concern that inflation of
nearly 13%, fueled by runaway public spending, might cause
Portugal to be left behind in a unified Europe.
   Although small, the cuts signal a strengthened commitment
on the part of the government of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
Silva to curb the weight of the state in the Portuguese
economy.
   "This is a tiny but encouraging step," Pedro Ferraz da
Costa, president of the Portuguese Confederation of Industry,
said about the dent in the budget deficit, which is projected
to hit 600 billion escudos this year. That is equal to 7.4%
of the nation's gross domestic product, or total amount of
goods and services minus income from abroad.
   Mr. Beleza, a staunch free-market advocate and former
central banker, also vowed to accelerate Portugal's
privatization drive launched last year.
   He detailed plans for the next five sell-offs: 51% of
shipping company Transinsular S.A.; 51% of the brewer Unicer
S.A. and bank Banco Totta &amp; Acores S.A., both partially
privatized last year; all of brewer Centralcer EP; and
one-third of Portugal's largest commercial bank, Banco
Portugues do Atlantico EP.
   He said insurance firms Tranquilidade S.A. and Alianca
S.A. and cement company Cimpor EP would follow.
   "Privatizations will be carried out as fast as possible,
but safely," said Mr. Beleza. He stressed the government's
wish to let Portuguese investors retain control of the
companies. Bankers expect the first five concerns to go on
the block before the end of the year. They predict the state
might set a minimum bid price of about 200 billion escudos
for all eight sales, but the final price is likely to be much
higher.
   Economists welcomed the announcements. They said that by
delaying privatizations and economic liberalization in the
past, the government had jeopardized Portugal's
competitiveness.
   "Unless state intervention is reduced, Portuguese firms
will have greater trouble preparing for the single market,"
Jorge Braga de Macedo, director of national economics at the
EC Commission, wrote recently.
   Yet at first sight, the Portuguese economy seems healthier
than ever. Official data show the economy grew 5.4% last
year, boosted by EC aid totaling about 4% of GDP.
Unemployment stands at 4.9%, one of the lowest rates in the
EC.
   The current-account deficit was $550 million last year.
That was more than offset by direct foreign investment, which
multiplied sevenfold since 1986 to 219 billion escudos. The
current account is made up of trade in goods and services and
certain unilateral transfers.
   But analysts say the elation over rapid growth is blinding
the country to dangers looming ahead.
   They say that without price stability, allowing full
freedom of capital flows -- a cornerstone of the European
single market -- is a highly risky proposition; inflation hit
12.8% last month, about seven percentage points above the EC
average. Mr. Cavaco Silva repeatedly has said that high
inflation will make it difficult for Portugal to join the
European Monetary System of fixed exchange rates before the
end of 1991.
   Local economists consider EMS membership crucial for
attracting foreign investors and trading partners because of
the expectations of economic stability it carries. "Portugal
cannot afford to remain outside the EMS," says Alfredo de
Sousa, head of a credit-rating agency.
