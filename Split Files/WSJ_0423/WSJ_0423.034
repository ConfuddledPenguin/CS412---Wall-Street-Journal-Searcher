   NEW YORK -- An agreement negotiated by Avon Products Inc.
to sell its 60% stake in Avon Japan for $450 million has
apparently collapsed.
   The proposed sale, to Friends of Freesia Co., Tokyo, and
Veji Sasaki, president of Freesia, was to have originally
closed on March 30. Mr. Sasaki later asked to extend the
closing to Friday and last week requested that the closing be
postponed until June.

   Avon declined, and executives of the direct-marketing
company now believe the transaction won't go through. If
talks aren't completed by Friday, Mr. Sasaki and his company
will forfeit $6.3 million in an escrow account.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Avon's
stock fell 12.5 cents a share to $35.875.
   Avon Products sold a 40% stake in its Japanese subsidiary
to the public in December 1987. Avon Japan has 2,000
employees, 350,000 independent sales representatives and
boasts a significant directmail business. The company sells
the traditional Avon product line of gifts, fashion
accessories and cosmetics.
   "We aren't sure what went wrong," said a spokesman for
Avon. "It doesn't appear to have anything to do with the
value of Avon Japan's stock, which has remained strong. There
are a number of other Japanese companies interested in buying
the business, and after the 27th we'll start talking to
them."
   The Japanese press speculated, however, that with the
recent rise in interest rates and the falling of the stock
market, Friends of Freesia was facing problems raising the
capital for the purchase.
   A spokesman for Friends of Freesia denied that the company
was having problems financing the purchase, but said it was
concerned about the recent instability within Avon
management. "We want to watch the condition of Avon in the
U.S. for the time being," the spokesman said.
   Avon told shareholders it would use the proceeds from the
sale of Avon Japan to pay down its debt. Total debt is
currently $695.9 million, compared with $1.13 billion at the
same time last year.
   Wall Street analysts said that the failed sale was a
reversal for Avon management, which is currently under
pressure from its largest shareholder, Chartwell Associates
L.P.
   "This sale was going to generate a huge amount of cash,"
said Alice Beebe Longley, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. "There's a good chance they'll
eventually find a buyer, but probably at a lower price."
   "It's a disappointment," added Diana Temple, an analyst
with Salomon Brothers. "They are under pressure to find a
buyer. They have to reduce their interest payments, and Avon
Japan is their largest remaining asset that they can sell."
   Robert L. Renck Jr., managing partner in the brokerage
company R. L. Renck &amp; Co., said the $450 million price
represented an outstanding value for Avon.
   "Considering what is going on in Japan today, I think they
will have to work real hard to get that price again," said
Mr. Renck. "I'm not thrilled. I'm also unhappy with
management's suit seeking to prevent Chartwell from acquiring
{more Avon stock}. I don't see how that suit enhances
shareholder value."
