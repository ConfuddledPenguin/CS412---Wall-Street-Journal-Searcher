   Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a Los Angeles-based health
maintenance organization that has been operating under
bankruptcy-law protection for 13 months, said it received an
unsolicited acquisition offer from rival PacifiCare Health
Systems Inc.
   "The offer is complex; it's about 15 pages and includes a
number of components, including cash," said a Maxicare
spokesman. Members of Maxicare and PacifiCare management and
their advisers will meet next week to discuss it, he said.
However, the offer formally expires at the close of business
today.

   The offer had been expected after PacifiCare said Thursday
that it was preparing an acquisition proposal. Maxicare,
which issued a statement Thursday saying that the company
wasn't for sale, moderated its response after the offer
arrived the next day.
   "We will seek to determine if this offer is in the best
interests of our enrollees, our health-care providers, the
creditors and shareholders, and our employees and
management," said Peter J. Ratican, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Maxicare said it plans to proceed with a scheduled public
hearing set for today in bankruptcy court in Santa Ana,
Calif., to discuss the company's previously filed
reorganization plan. Under terms of the plan, shareholders
would receive $102 million in cash, $67 million in notes and
newly issued common shares and warrants.
   Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare chief financial officer, said on
Thursday that the Cypress, Calif.-based company would submit
a "serious" offer and that the company believes Maxicare
would make an "excellent strategic addition." Roughly 40% of
Maxicare's 320,000 members are in California, where
PacifiCare has a strong presence. Maxicare also has
operations in six other states, including Indiana, Illinois
and Wisconsin.
   At its peak a few years ago, Maxicare was the nation's
largest publicly traded HMO with more than two million
members. The company fell on hard times after it went deeply
into debt to acquire two other HMOs. In the nine months ended
Sept. 30, 1989, Maxicare had a $22.3 million loss on revenue
of $412.3 million. Maxicare shares are traded in the pink
sheets.
   PacifiCare said that 70% of its 636,000 members are in
California. The HMO also owns and operates HMOs in Oregon,
Oklahoma, Texas and Washington and an insurance subsidiary
licensed in 33 states. In the year ended Sept. 30, PacifiCare
posted net income of $10.9 million on revenue of $650.2
million.
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, PacifiCare
shares closed unchanged at $19.75. The acquisition proposal
was announced after the end of trading.
