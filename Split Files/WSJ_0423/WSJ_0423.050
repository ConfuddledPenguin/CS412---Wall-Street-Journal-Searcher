   So Michael Milken has agreed to plead guilty to crimes
carrying a $600 million fine and a jail sentence of perhaps
five or six years. Ivan Boesky got three years and $100
million for trading suitcases of cash and bribing fiduciaries
to forsake their duty. We will be fascinated to learn
precisely what were Mr. Milken's transgressions.
   In preparation, let us puzzle over the crimes of Robert
Freeman, sentenced to four months and $1 million for being on
the other end of the phone line when someone said "your Bunny
has a good nose." With Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor, Mr.
Freeman was one of the Giuliani Three, arrested spectacularly
and released to seemingly perpetual limbo. In the end Mr.
Freeman agreed to a plea bargain confessing only the "Bunny"
count. Prosecutors' attempts to sentence him for other crimes
with no conviction or even indictment were dispatched by
Judge Pierre Leval.

   At the sentencing, Judge Leval expressed some sympathy for
Mr. Freeman's situation. But he said a jail sentence was
needed as a warning to other players in the market. He said,
"It has astonished me to read in the press that conduct,
illegal conduct, criminal conduct, of the nature that is
before me now should be condoned or accepted as a trifle
because it is done every day, because this is how the market
for arbitrage functions."
   The facts were these: Mr. Freeman, chief arbitrager for
Goldman Sachs, had acquired Beatrice stock and options,
betting that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would complete its
leveraged buy-out. In his job of keeping up on the news, Mr.
Freeman called Henry Kravis, who he recalls didn't say much
but was "very abrupt and appeared anxious." Thinking this
over, Mr. Freeman began to unload his Beatrice position the
next morning.
   Then he got a call from another arb, Bernard Lasker, known
as Bunny, who said he'd heard rumors about problems with the
deal. Mr. Freeman made other calls, including one to KKR
investment banker Martin Siegel to ask about the rumors. At
one point Mr. Siegel said, "Your Bunny has a good nose." By
the time this conversation took place, Mr. Freeman had
already sold two-thirds of the Beatrice stock he sold that
day.
   We confess, Judge Leval, that to us it looks a lot more
like "the way the market for arbitrage functions" than it
looks like "criminal behavior." No one alleges that the
conversation with Mr. Kravis was criminal, since he was a
principal and not a fiduciary. The case turns on the meaning
of Mr. Siegel's "Bunny" remark.
   Just what did this mean? Prosecutors hoped to prove it
meant, "Good guess, make a bundle, and you owe me a good tip
on the next transaction where you're an insider." This would
indeed be a serious matter, but prosecutors could not prove
it. To us, the remark means, "We're both adults, and
obviously we can't talk much about this, but there's no point
in my lying to you about what you already know." Is this a
crime?
   Upon hearing the "Bunny" remark, the theory apparently
goes, a bell should have gone off in Mr. Freeman's head that
his initial intuition had crossed the line into "inside
information," and that he should therefore cancel his selling
program. While this seems a stretch, maybe the SEC should
send him a letter saying don't do it again. But if it's a
reason to jail someone, or even put him out of the securities
business, legitimate information-seeking will become a
dangerous game, and the efficient pricing in markets will
suffer.
   As Judge Leval said, it was "a matter of a temptation, an
indiscretion, all of which took place so far as I can see in
a manner of minutes." In other words, there was no
premeditated intent, no bags of cash or quid pro quo. Mr.
Freeman was not Mr. Boesky. Indeed, we find it doubtful his
confessed transgressions would have been of any interest to
prosecutors had they not bungled the initial case and tried
to save face through maximum pressure.
   Mr. Milken's confessed crimes, we're told, include neither
the maximum-pressure RICO counts nor "insider trading." So we
wait to see whether they're like Mr. Boesky's bribes or like
Mr. Freeman's hypertechnical transgressions.
