   LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said it established $19.7
million in first-quarter reserves to cover weather-related
losses in its reinsurance and property-casualty insurance
segments.
   The reserves will result in an after-tax charge to net
income of $13 million, or 27 cents a share. In the year-ago
period, the insurance and investment services concern had net
income of $80.8 million, or $1.37 a share, including $10.6
million in profit from discontinued operations.

   Recent violent wind and rainstorms in Europe will affect
the company's reinsurance segment. And winter-related storms
in the Midwest had an impact on Kemper's property-casualty
operation, the company said.
   Kemper also said that a restructuring under way at its
brokerage firms will contribute to an anticipated loss from
that operation, which is also plagued by trading losses and
lower volume. Business "improved in March," however, and the
company said its securities brokers "will have a
substantially smaller loss in the first quarter of 1990" than
they suffered in the fourth quarter of 1988.

   KEMPER CORP. expects to report that its securities
operations had a "substantially smaller" loss in the first
quarter of 1990 than the operations incurred in the fourth
quarter of 1989. In yesterday's edition, the comparison was
misstated.
