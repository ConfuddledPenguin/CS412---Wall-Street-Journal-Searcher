   "What then is the American, this new man?" a French
immigrant asked two centuries ago. Hector St. John de
Crevecoeur gave the classic answer to his own question. "He
is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient
prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode
of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the
new rank he holds. . . . Here individuals of all nations are
melted into a new race of man."
   The conception of America as a transforming nation,
banishing old identities and creating a new one, prevailed
through most of American history. It was famously
reformulated by Israel Zangwill, an English writer of Russian
Jewish origin, when he called America "God's crucible, the
great melting pot where all the races of Europe are melting
and re-forming." Most people who came to America expected to
become Americans. They wanted to escape a horrid past and to
embrace a hopeful future. Their goals were deliverance and
assimilation.

   Thus Crevecoeur wrote his "Letters from an American
Farmer" in his acquired English, not in his native French.
Thus immigrants reared in other tongues urged their children
to learn English as speedily as possible. German immigrants
tried for a moment to gain status for their language, but the
effort got nowhere. The dominant culture was Anglo-Saxon and,
with modification and enrichment, remained Anglo-Saxon.
   The melting pot was one of those metaphors that turned out
only to be partly true, and recent years have seen an
astonishing repudiation of the whole conception. Many
Americans today righteously reject the historic goal of "a
new race of man." The contemporary ideal is not assimilation
but ethnicity. The escape from origins has given way to the
search for "roots." "Ancient prejudices and manners" -- the
old-time religion, the old-time diet -- have made a
surprising comeback.
   These developments portend a new turn in American life.
Instead of a transformative nation with a new and distinctive
identity, America increasingly sees itself as preservative of
old identities. We used to say e pluribus unum. Now we
glorify pluribus and belittle unum. The melting pot yields to
the Tower of Babel.
   The new turn has had marked impact on the universities.
Very little agitates academia more these days than the
demands of passionate minorities for revision of the
curriculum: in history, the denunciation of Western
civilization courses as cultural imperialism; in literature,
the denunciation of the "canon," the list of essential books,
as an instrumentality of the existing power structure.
   A recent report by the New York State Commissioner of
Education's task force on "Minorities: Equity and Excellence"
luridly describes "African Americans, Asian Americans, Puerto
Ricans/Latinos and Native Americans" as "victims of an
intellectual and educational oppression." The "systematic
bias toward European culture and its derivatives," the report
claims, has "a terribly damaging effect on the psyche of
young people of African, Asian, Latino and Native American
descent" -- a doubtful assertion for which no proof is
vouchsafed.
   Of course teachers of history and literature should give
due recognition to women, black Americans, Indians, Hispanics
and other groups who were subordinated and ignored in the
high noon of male Anglo-Saxon dominance. In recent years they
have begun belatedly to do so. But the cult of ethnicity,
pressed too far, exacts costs -- as, for example, the current
pressure to teach history and literature not as intellectual
challenges but as psychological therapy.
   There is nothing new, of course, about the yearnings of
excluded group for affirmations of their own historical and
cultural dignity. When Irish-Americans were thought beyond
the pale, their spokesmen responded much as spokesmen for
blacks, Hispanics and others respond today. Professor John V.
Kelleher, for many years Harvard's distinguished Irish
scholar, once recalled his first exposure to Irish-American
history -- "turgid little essays on the fact that the
Continental Army was 76% Irish, or that many of George
Washington's closest friends were nuns and priests, or that
Lincoln got the major ideas for the Second Inaugural Address
from the Hon. Francis P. Mageghegan of Alpaca, New York, a
pioneer manufacturer of cast-iron rosary beads." John
Kelleher called this "the
there's-always-an-Irishman-at-the-bottom-of-it-doing-the-
real-work-approach to American history."
   Fortunately most Irish-Americans disregarded their
spokesmen and absorbed the American tradition. About 1930,
Kelleher said, those "turgid little essays began to vanish
from Irish-American papers. He added, "I wonder whose is the
major component in the Continental Army these days?" The
answer, one fears, is getting to be black, Jews and
Hispanics.
   There is often artificiality about the attempts to use
history to minister to psychological needs. When I encounter
black insistence on inserting Africa into mainstream
curricula, I recall the 1956 presidential campaign. Adlai
Stevenson, for whom I was working, had a weak record on civil
rights in America but was a champion of African nationalism.
I suggested to a group of sympathetic black leaders that
maybe if Stevenson talked to black audiences about Africa, he
could make up for his deficiencies on civil rights. My
friends laughed and said that American blacks couldn't care
less about Africa. That is no longer the case; but one can't
escape the feeling that present emotions are more
manufactured than organic.
   Let us by all means teach women's history, black history,
Hispanic history. But let us teach them as history, not as a
means of promoting group self-esteem. I don't often agree
with Gore Vidal, but I liked his remark the other day: "What
I hate is good citizenship history. That has wrecked every
history book. Now we're getting `The Hispanics are warm and
joyous and have brought such wonder into our lives,' you
know, and before them the Jews, and before them the blacks.
And the women. I mean, cut it out]"
   Novelists, moralists, politicians, fabulators can go
beyond the historical evidence to tell inspiring stories. But
historians are custodians of professional standards. Their
objective is critical analysis, accuracy and objectivity, not
making people feel better about themselves.
   Heaven knows how dismally historians fall short of their
ideals; how sadly our interpretations are dominated and
distorted by unconscious preconceptions; how obsessions of
race and nation blind us to our own bias. All historians may
in one way or another mythologize history. But the answer to
bad history is not "good citizenship history" -- more bad
history written from a different viewpoint. The answer to bad
history is better history.
   The ideological assault in English departments on the
"canon" as an instrument of political oppression implies the
existence of a monolithic body of work designed to enforce
the "hegemony" of a class or race or sex. In fact, most great
literature and much good history are deeply subversive in
their impact on orthodoxies. Consider the American canon:
Emerson, Whitman, Melville, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Mark Twain,
Henry Adams, William and Henry James, Holmes, Dreiser,
Faulkner. Lackeys of the ruling class? Agents of American
imperialism?
   Let us by all means learn about other continents and other
cultures. But, lamentable as some may think it, we inherit an
American experience, as America inherits a European
experience. To deny the essentially European origins of
American culture is to falsify history.
   We should take pride in our distinctive inheritance as
other nations take pride in their distinctive inheritances.
Certainly there is no need for Western civilization, the
source of the ideas of individual freedom and political
democracy to which most of the world now aspires, to
apologize to cultures based on despotism, superstition,
tribalism and fanaticism. Let us abjure what Bertrand Russell
called the fallacy of "the superior virtue of the oppressed."
   Of course we must teach the Western democratic tradition
in its true proportions-not as a fixed, final and complacent
orthodoxy, intolerant of deviation and dissent, but as an
ever-evolving creed fulfilling its ideals through debate,
self-criticism, protest, disrespect and irreverence, a
tradition in which all groups have rights of heterodoxy and
opportunities for self-assertion. It is a tradition that has
empowered people of all nations and races. Little can have a
more "terribly damaging effect on the psyche" than for
educators to tell young blacks and Hispanics and Asians that
it is not for them.
   Belief in one's own culture does not mean disdain for
other cultures. But one step at a time: No culture can hope
to ingest other cultures all at once, certainly not before it
ingests its own. After we have mastered our own culture, we
can explore the world.
   If we repudiate the quite marvelous inheritance that
history has bestowed on us, we invite the fragmentation of
our own culture into a quarrelsome spatter of enclaves,
ghettos and tribes. The bonds of cohesion in our society are
sufficiently fragile, or so it seems to me, that it makes no
sense to strain them by encouraging and exalting cultural and
linguistic apartheid. The rejection of the melting pot points
the republic in the direction of incoherence and chaos.
   In the 21st century, if present trends hold, non-whites in
the U.S. will begin to outnumber whites. This will bring
inevitable changes in the national ethos but not, one must
hope, at the expense of national cohesion. Let the new
Americans forswear the cult of ghettoization and agree with
Crevecoeur, as with most immigrants in the two centuries
since, that in America "individuals of all nations are melted
into a new race of man."
