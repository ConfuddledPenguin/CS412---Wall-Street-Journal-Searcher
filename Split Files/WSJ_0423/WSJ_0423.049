   CHICAGO -- Inland Steel Industries Inc. reported a 62%
drop in first-quarter earnings as a result of lower volume
and prices.
   In the quarter, the steelmaker earned $18.7 million, or 37
cents a share on revenue of $992.5 million, compared with
$49.4 million, or $1.38 a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion
in the year-ago quarter. Steel shipments dropped 10% to
1,153,000 tons.

   The latest quarter includes operating profit of $30.6
million, including a one-time $8.7 million utility rate
refund from the company's steel segment and $9.8 million from
the service center segment.
   While disappointing, the company noted that first-quarter
results were higher than the fourth quarter of 1989, when the
company earned only nine cents a share. The company
attributed the recent improvement to higher shipments and
reduced operating costs. However, it also noted that volume
remained disappointing, indicating continued inventory
reductions in automotive and service center sectors.
Moreover, steel prices seem to have stabilized slightly below
the fourth quarter.
