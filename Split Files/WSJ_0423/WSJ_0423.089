   WASHINGTON -- House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt wants
the U.S. government to help develop some promising commercial
technologies. Vice President Dan Quayle says he would rather
cut back on "unnecessary" regulations.
   Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, wants the government's
top economic officials to sit on the National Security
Council; the Republican Mr. Quayle would rather think about
changing antitrust laws. And while Mr. Gephardt wants more
federal support for U.S. exports, Mr. Quayle wants to clamp
down on liability suits.

   The two fair-haired men of their respective parties agree
that the U.S. faces a big problem with something called
"competitiveness," and they both want to do something about
it. But they have been charting very different approaches to
the nation's economic challenges.
   Competitiveness is a topic that will continue to be
debated as the U.S. increasingly moves away from
preoccupation with Cold War issues to concern about economic
strength and foreign competition. While the two men certainly
aren't the only participants in this debate, they have become
important spokesmen for their respective parties and
ideologies: Vice President Quayle through his chairmanship of
the Bush administration's Council on Competitiveness, Rep.
Gephardt through his leadership post in the House and his
continued outspokenness on the trade issues that he stressed
in his 1988 presidential bid.
   Not surprisingly, there's an important political dimension
to the debate between the ambitious young Midwesterners with
presidential aspirations. "It's a very good issue for
Gephardt," says Brookings Institution analyst Stephen Hess.
"It may be at the cutting edge of the issues the Democrats
need to insinuate themselves back into the White House: more
protectionism, playing to union `Buy America' support and
concern about the Japanese."
   On the other hand, Mr. Hess adds, competitiveness is more
of a defensive issue for the Republicans. "They're in power
and have got to be more restrained. Whatever Quayle does is
either going to have to be very modest or very circumspect
and very responsible."
   But there could be dangers for Democrats, too. An overt
protectionist message "runs counter to some basic American
instincts," cautions Democratic political consultant Greg
Schneiders. Noting the failure of Mr. Gephardt's presidential
bid, Mr. Schneiders says that if a program "begins to look or
sound like any kind of management of the economy, I think
people will shy away from it."
   The two sides begin by framing the issue in similar terms:
The country isn't in a crisis, progress is being made on the
trade deficit and other problems, but some serious policy
questions remain nonetheless.
   "Some of the concerns {about competitiveness} are
overstated," stemming from Americans' anxieties about
recession, the dollar and the burgeoning trade and budget
deficits of the last decade, says Burton Pines, a vice
president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think
tank here. "What isn't overstated is the potential threat.
Are we competitive? Yes, we are. But could we do more to
enhance our ability to compete? Yes, we could."
   In some ways, the vice president's task is more
challenging than Rep. Gephardt's: How to articulate a
positive strategy without violating his president's longtime
abhorrence of government intervention in the private sector.
"My role," Mr. Quayle says, "is to look at the question of
how do we take the burdens off our private sector, the
burdens we impose ourselves," as well as keeping up the
president's drumbeat on cutting the capital-gains tax. "What
we have to do is get consistency and continuity within our
own playing field."
   So far, the Competitiveness Council's main project has
been supporting a bill by Sens. Robert Kasten (R., Wis.) and
John Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) to impose some federal limits on
liability lawsuits and to curb some big product-liability
judgments, a major complaint of businesses in the wake of
escalating insurance and litigation costs. Strongly opposed
by trial lawyers and some consumer groups, such legislation
has been stalled for a decade.
   But the sponsors hope the added push from the
administration's support will enable the bill at least to
clear the Senate by year end. By then, the council hopes to
have proposals on two other issues: advancing the
commercialization of biotechnology research and modifying
antitrust laws to allow more corporate mergers.
   Ironically, some of the vice president's natural allies in
the business community and the conservative movement are
disappointed in his performance on the competitiveness issue.
"Quayle's got to do more on that. That's an area where he
could really do something," says the Heritage Foundation's
Mr. Pines.
   Among his suggestions: Mr. Quayle and the council should
develop a "nice, easy" definition of competitiveness that
stresses certain conservative principles, such as freedom of
choice. A Heritage working group also has suggested that
proponents of new regulations be required to come up with a
"competitiveness impact statement" that would detail the
economic consequences of their proposals. Heritage also calls
for a stronger push on areas such as antitrust, saying the
laws are outmoded in an era of strong foreign competition and
substantial cooperation between Japanese and European
companies.
   Others say that while the projects undertaken by the
council are fine as far as they go, the scope remains too
small. "Overall, I wouldn't give them {council members} very
high grades," says Paul Huard, a vice president with the
National Association of Manufacturers. "They're not really
serious, as near as we can tell, about doing something about
the high cost of capital. They talk about doing something
about research and development, about depreciation. They talk
about it, they're studying it, but basically there isn't much
forward motion."
   Mr. Quayle's staffers defend his approach, saying he's
limited in part by his role, since other departments have
specific responsibilities for issues such as addressing the
budget deficit. They also point to Bush
administration-sponsored increases in the research and
education budgets as evidence of serious commitment. But even
more important, according to Mr. Quayle's chief of staff,
William Kristol, "our first task has been to knock down all
the bad ideas by Democrats on the Hill."
   Some of those "bad ideas" he refers to come from Rep.
Gephardt, whose comprehensive legislation -- a Trade and
Technology Promotion Act introduced last fall -- will be
closely reviewed by several committees in the next few weeks.
Among Mr. Gephardt's key proposals: to require that the
president's commerce, Treasury and trade advisers be given
seats on the National Security Council, a move he says is
necessary to raise the profile of economic issues and give
them parity with foreign policy and national security. He
also wants to develop a new agency that would help foster
research and application of so-called "emerging
technologies."
   "The Republican view, the conservative view, is that the
government has no role -- that the government simply
deregulates and the private sector will take care of the
rest," says the St. Louis Democrat, whose district includes
suppliers to the Big Three auto makers, a leading aircraft
manufacturer and numerous other manufacturing concerns.
   "I think the better view is that we're up against
competition, which in some cases benefits from close
cooperation with the government. While we can't emulate that
entirely," Rep. Gephardt says, "government needs to create a
better environment in which our private sector can develop
and market its products."
   To criticisms from conservatives that his approach would
be too interventionist, Mr. Gephardt responds that he doesn't
see that at all, noting that the government has previously
aided the development of some defense-related technologies.
He also contends that better coordination is needed among the
different agencies. What good does it do, he asks, for the
U.S. trade representative to push to open markets that don't
offer the largest long-term opportunities for U.S.
businesses? And while product-liability and antitrust
measures may "have merit," he argues they aren't aggressive
enough steps to aid U.S. companies.
   Neither the vice president's nor the House majority
leader's approach is likely to be adopted in the near term,
but advocates for both men say they look forward to
opportunities to explain their differences. "The issue of how
to keep America strong is a major issue," says Mr. Kristol.
"I think we'll increasingly help to define the differences
between the administration and the Democrats," especially, he
added, "as the fall campaign heats up."
