   PARIS -- Michael Whiteman is angry with Source Perrier
S.A. But he says he nevertheless will be offering its water
again this week at the Rainbow Room, a New York dinner and
dancing spot his company manages.
   Mr. Whiteman's ambivalence reflects a deeper dilemma
facing Perrier this week as it begins its long-awaited
relaunch in the crucial U.S. market, its biggest market
outside France. A few bottles will be available in New York
as early as today, although Perrier says it will be the end
of May before it is present again in 90% of the U.S., and
then in limited volumes.

   The good news for Perrier is that beverage analysts, many
of them bearish about the company's U.S. future when it
recalled its water two months ago, now are turning cautiously
optimistic. They say most consumers are surprisingly relaxed
about the benzene contamination of Perrier's mineral water
shipments world-wide, disclosed early in March.
   Tom Pirko, president of Los Angeles-based beverage
consulting firm BevMark Inc., at first expected Perrier to
lose 15% of its gross sales. Now, he says that if the
relaunch goes smoothly sales should fall no more than 5% and
may eventually even surpass previous performances.
   The bad news for Perrier is that things may not go
smoothly. Perrier's handling of the crisis has deeply
disturbed a small number of its most wealthy and influential
former fans. They feel Perrier betrayed a trust by failing to
explain properly how small amounts of benzene, a suspected
carcinogen, got into its high-priced water.
   Some, such as Charles Fisher, a New York caterer for big
banks, law firms and securities houses, say they'll never
sell or drink the stuff again. John Dingell, the powerful
Democratic congressman from Michigan, is threatening to hold
hearings next autumn on accusations that bottled water makers
in general, and Perrier in particular, mislead consumers in
their labels and advertising. The Food &amp; Drug Administration
required Perrier to modify its label before allowing it back
in the U.S., in order to remove suggestions that Perrier's
bubbles occur naturally. (Most of the bubbles, which Perrier
says come from a natural source, are added to the water at
Perrier's bottling plant.)
   "If that kind of news hits TV and radio, that stops
Perrier dead in its tracks," maintains Mr. Pirko.
   The U.S. relaunch will be the company's biggest and most
complex since it began offering its water again in France.
The water now is available in most of Europe, although
supplies remain limited. But the U.S. relaunch is complicated
by sheer geographic size and by health and quality issues.
   Perrier, for example, has become the object of a dozen
class-action lawsuits in the U.S. Because of that kind of
worry, the Paris brokerage firm, Sellier S.A., which follows
Perrier closely, published a study last month urging clients
to sell Perrier shares.
   Officials at Perrier Group of America Inc., Perrier's U.S.
subsidiary, say they intend to "aggressively relaunch Perrier
throughout the country," as Kim Jeffery, sales and marketing
senior vice president, puts it. The aim is to regain
Perrier's former U.S. market share of 14% of all sparkling
waters, and 6% of all bottled waters. Perrier is tripling its
U.S. ad budget to $18 million this year, and will spend an
additional $7 million on promotions. That is far more than
any competitor will spend.
   Mr. Jeffery says he believes Perrier ads and labels have
been fair and accurate. Perrier officials insist that any
health hazard from the benzene contamination, which appears
to have lasted from May of last year until this March, was
minuscule.
   Perrier attributes the contamination to improper
filtration of its carbon dioxide gas, which naturally
contains small amounts of benzene. The filters apparently
became overloaded after Perrier switched to a new gas source
that had different levels of impurities. Perrier has improved
its filtration process and Food and Drug Administration
officials say tests show Perrier no longer is contaminated by
benzene.
   After a New York ceremony on Thursday, Perrier plans a
series of giveaways, television ads and talk-show appearances
around the country.
