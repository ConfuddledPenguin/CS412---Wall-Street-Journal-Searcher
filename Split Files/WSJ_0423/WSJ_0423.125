   AAR Corp., Elk Grove Village, Ill., said that it expects a
"modest gain" in earnings for the fiscal year ending May 31,
but that it has a "cautionary view" of the fourth quarter.
   The company said the outlook was given by its chairman,
Ira A. Eichner, during a presentation at a conference last
week. On Friday, AAR issued a statement in response to recent
inquiries about the trading activity in its common stock. The
company said it believes that the activity resulted from
comments during the presentation.
