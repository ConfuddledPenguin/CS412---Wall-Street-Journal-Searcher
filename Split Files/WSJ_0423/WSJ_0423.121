   Phoenix Technologies Ltd., Norwood, Mass., reported a
fiscal second-quarter net loss of $4.6 million, or 46 cents a
share, compared with year-earlier net income of $2.3 million,
or 21 cents a share.
   The loss for the quarter ended March 31 was slightly less
than Phoenix forecast last month when it warned investors
that the second quarter would show a deficit.

<TEXT>
   Revenue slumped to $8.7 million from $17.6 million a year
earlier.
   Phoenix late last year changed its revenue-recognition
policies, booking business as it is paid for rather than when
products are shipped. The company has said the new policy
will build a "solid, predictable revenue stream" after a
period of adjustment.
   The second-quarter results include a $1 million charge for
reducing its head count and streamlining operations, Phoenix
said.
   The company said bookings of new business, particularly in
the software-publishing area, increased strongly.
