   LONDON -- British Coal Corp.'s pension funds are together
to bid 191 pence ($3.14) a share for the 66.2% of Globe
Investment Trust they don't own after the funds purchased a
further 5% of Britain's largest investment trust.
   The bid by the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme
and the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme would value the whole of
Globe at #1.02 billion ($1.68 billion).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bid was prompted by the funds' purchase of 26.8
million Globe shares at 191 pence, which raised the funds'
combined holdings in Globe to 33.8%.
   Under United Kingdom law, any company that acquires more
than 29.9% of another must make an offer to buy the remaining
shares of that company at an equivalent price.
