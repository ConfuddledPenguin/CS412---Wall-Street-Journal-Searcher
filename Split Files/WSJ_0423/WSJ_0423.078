   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- La Quinta Motor Inns Inc. expects to
report that its net loss for the first quarter was "about the
same" as the net loss of $673,000, or five cents a share, in
the year-earlier quarter, Chairman Sam Barshop said.
   Still, Mr. Barshop in an interview described the overall
picture for the motel chain's first quarter as "excellent,"
citing significant increases in revenue, operating profit and
occupancy and room rates.

   La Quinta's first-quarter revenue rose to around $52
million, a 15% increase from $45.2 million in the
year-earlier period, said Fran Bissaillon, La Quinta senior
vice president, administration and treasurer.
   He noted that the net loss recorded for the first quarter
in 1989 included a $1.8 million capital gain from the sale of
inns to a master limited partnership. In the just concluded
quarter, the company "replaced that $1.8 million of capital
gains with operating profit which is much superior," he said.
   Mr. Bissaillon also said the company expects to report an
increase in operating profit of "between 40% and 45%" from
the $6.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. He said
operating profit was wiped out by non-operating expenses,
which rose more than 12% from the $9.4 million recorded in
the year-ago quarter.
   Mr. Bissaillon said non-operating expenses had risen
because funds, which had been drawing interest that offset
interest payments on debt, had been used to build three new
motels. The company's improved operating results also led to
increased payments to minority interests "in the $1 million
range," Mr. Bissaillon said.
   "But all of our costs have been increasing at a rate much
less than our revenues have been increasing," said Mr.
Bissaillon, who noted that occupancy rates had increased to
64% from 60% during the quarter and average room rates rose
5%, to $39.84 from $37.91.
   The first quarter is traditionally a slow time in the
hospitality industry, said Mr. Barshop, who called La
Quinta's results "a pleasant surprise." He attributed them to
an improving Texas economy, a newly computerized reservation
system and the remodeling of more than 180 La Quinta
properties over the past three years.
   La Quinta operates 207 motels, about half of them in Texas
and surrounding states.
   "We felt that the Texas turnaround would come," said Mr.
Barshop, who estimated that La Quinta occupancy rates within
Texas have risen to about 69% from 63% a year ago.
   Mr. Barshop said the new computer system links La Quinta's
own reservation system directly with travel agents and
airline reservation desks. Largely because of it, both call
volume and the number of confirmed reservations increased by
about 25% during the quarter, Mr. Barshop said.
   In addition, Mr. Barshop said the chain, which has
traditionally focused on the budget-minded business traveler,
has also begun marketing its services to tour groups, bus
companies and auto clubs.
   "We're marketing to different groups than before," Mr.
Barshop said. "We're seeing more and more tourists discover
us."
   As previously reported, La Quinta and AEW Partners L.P., a
Boston-based investment fund, have established a $150 million
acquisition fund to be used to purchase as many as 50
distressed hotel properties for conversion into La Quinta
motels.
   Although the new partnership already has made bids on 10
properties, Mr. Barshop said he didn't expect the new
partnership's activities to have a substantial impact on La
Quinta's operating results for the remainder of 1990.
   While declining to provide an estimate on earnings for the
rest of 1990, Mr. Barshop said he expected La Quinta's
results for the next three quarters to reflect what he sees
as the "continued strong improvement" of the Texas economy.
   "I think tourism in Texas is going to be very strong this
summer and I think lodging is going to be very strong," Mr.
Barshop said. "And I think we will be leading the pack as far
as lodging occupancy goes in this state."
