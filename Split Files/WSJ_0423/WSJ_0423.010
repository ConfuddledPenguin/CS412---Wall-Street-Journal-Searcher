   IRVINE, Calif. -- National Education Corp. posted a
first-quarter net loss of $8.4 million, or 28 cents a share,
reflecting continued problems at its Applied Learning
subsidiary, which has had troubles with customer credits.
   The company indicated that the loss for the quarter could
be even greater once it finalizes a wrongful-termination
settlement with its former chief executive officer, David
Bright. That settlement would be charged against latest
first-quarter earnings, which will be restated. A recent
arbitration decision found that the termination of Mr. Bright
wasn't "for cause" as defined by his contract. National
Education declined to estimate the amount of the settlement,
but said it could be "material." The exact amount will be
determined at an arbitration hearing next month.

   In the year-earlier first quarter, the vocational training
company had net income of $7 million, or 24 cents share.
   Revenue fell 14% to $85.4 million from $99.5 million.
   Separately, National Education said it elected J.W.
Cwiertnia, its 48-year-old president and chief operating
officer, to the additional post of chief executive officer,
succeeding David C. Jones, 68, who remains chairman. Mr.
Cwiertnia resigned as president of National Education in
March 1989 to become chief operating officer of another
company, but returned in July after Mr. Bright left.
   The company also said its lenders agreed in principle to
grant it a 90-day extension on a requirement that it raise
$10 million in additional capital by April 30. National
Education said the lenders agreed to the extension because it
had positive cash flow in the latest first quarter. Mr.
Cwiertnia said the company is exploring "several options" to
raise the capital.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
National Education shares closed at $4.625, off 12.5 cents.
