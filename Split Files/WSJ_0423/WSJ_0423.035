   NEW YORK -- As last week's 55.85-point slide in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average made clear, rising interest rates
and weak earnings are troubling the stock market again.
   Question is, will these familiar worries cause a market
correction like the 267-point, 9.5% dive the industrial
average took in about one month during the first quarter?

   A correction, yes, but not as bad, analysts predict. The
reason is that investors now are more interested in some
second-tier stocks of companies whose fortunes are tied to
the economy's growth. Last week, for example, PPG Industries
climbed 5.8% while the market sank, partly because the
company raised its dividend. With such stocks in favor, the
market's correction will be muted, they say.
   There's little chance of avoiding one, though, analysts
believe. The yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond has climbed to just under 9% from about 8% since
December. Higher interest rates both threaten to slow the
economy and to make bonds more attractive investments than
stocks.
   Meanwhile, first-quarter earnings disappointments are in
full parade: Of 734 companies that have reported quarterly
earnings so far, out of more than 4,000 tracked by Zacks
Investment Research Inc., 52% announced disappointing results
and only 39% had better-than-expected results. At that rate,
aggregate earnings of the 500 companies in Standard &amp; Poor's
index will be down 9% this year, says Ben Zacks, executive
vice president of the research firm.
   The next question is, will a correction most hurt the
blue-chip stocks that have resisted this year's market
decline, or the secondary and tertiary issues that so far
have borne the brunt of investor selling?
   The divergence between these two groups of stocks is
glaring, and many analysts think this correction will somehow
bring them back into line. As of Friday, the industrial
average was down 2.1% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 was off
5.2% and the Nasdaq composite index had lost 6.4%.
   Another measure of the gap between the biggest stocks and
the broad market is the increase in declining New York Stock
Exchange issues relative to advancing ones. Subtracting Big
Board losers from winners each day and charting the
cumulative difference produces an advance-decline line that
has been sagging since late August -- even as the Dow
industrials kept climbing, eventually hitting a record high
of 2810.15 on Jan 2.
   Some investing buffs say this split reminds them of the
stock market of 1972-1973. That divergence was resolved in
the bear market of 1974, during which the industrials dropped
a colossal 48%.
   But a bear market isn't necessarily in the cards for 1990,
says Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons. He declares, "The current divergence between
the Dow industrial average and the broader measures is a sign
that the market is operating intelligently."
   Mr. Goldman elaborates: "The outlook for the market is
uncertain, and therefore we should have a selective market
where you pay a premium for companies that have definable
earnings prospects." Neither bull nor bear, the market is in
a trading range between 2500 and 2850 in the industrial
average, Mr. Goldman asserts. Investors will make money by
picking stocks, not by catching a ride on the market's
overall direction.
   The Dow shot higher in the early 1970s because investors
flocked to a small cadre of growth stocks. Then, as now, the
economic outlook was uncertain, and growth stocks -- shares
of companies with unique products and a proven record of
earnings growth -- are again a favorite investment theme.
   Among the "nifty 50" stocks of the early 1970s were
Eastman Kodak, International Business Machines, Procter &amp;
Gamble, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Schlumberger,
Polaroid and Xerox, to name a few. All but Polaroid,
Schlumberger and Xerox are in the industrial average.
   The attraction of these big stocks 15 years ago is the
same as now, namely enough size to weather economic storms
and the benefit of multinational operations. "One reason
people are buying big stocks today is that multinationals are
doing relatively well," says Michael Cosgrove, principal of
the Dallas-based economic research firm, The Econoclast.
"Growth in Europe and Japan is faster than in the U.S."
   What sent the stock market into the soup in 1974 was a
series of inflation shocks. Oil prices skyrocketed; labor and
food costs soared; the dollar tumbled, making imports more
expensive. Investors owning big stocks were partially
protected, but eventually even large companies couldn't
withstand the poisonous combination of slow economic growth
and high inflation. By late 1974, the industrial average
closed at a low of 577.60. Xerox was trading around $50, down
from about $150 a year or so before; Polaroid tumbled to
under $8 from $74 in the nifty-50 days.
   Inflation isn't a minor threat today, Mr. Cosgrove warns.
Stubborn inflation pressures are being caused by factories
running full tilt and by low unemployment. And that's another
argument for owning big stocks today, he thinks. "Big
companies can pass along price increases; a smaller company
isn't able to do that," Mr. Cosgrove says.
   With many investors seeking safety and earnings
predictability, big stocks may continue to outperform the
broad market for months, says Gail Dudack, market analyst at
S.G. Warburg Securities. She considers the divergence between
the big stocks and the broad market ominous, however. Sooner
or later, she says, some of the Dow stocks will hit the
skids.
   "This market has hurt you, but the Dow doesn't reflect
that," says Ms. Dudack. Secondary issues will continue to lag
behind big stocks for a while, she believes. "Secondary
stocks will fall harder but bounce better" when the eventual
turnaround materializes, Ms. Dudack says.
   Meanwhile, the higher the climb of consumer nondurable
stocks -- such as Coca Cola Co., Procter &amp; Gamble, and Philip
Morris -- in the Dow average, the harder they'll fall later,
Ms. Dudack predicts. Investors will dump these stocks, which,
together with financial issues that are out of favor already
because of rising interest rates, constitute about 45% of the
industrial average. Investors will buy cyclical stocks, she
says, but they make up only 39% of the average.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices tumbled Friday for the third consecutive
session as nervousness about the banking sector added to the
market's woes.
   Bank issues fell across the board in the wake of Moody's
Investors Service's decision to place the debt ratings of
Citicorp, the largest U.S. bank holding company, under review
for a possible downgrade.
   Further weakness in the bond market and worries about the
inflation outlook -- stemming from last week's disappointing
news of a 0.5% rise in March consumer prices -- also kept
stocks under pressure.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 15.99 to 2695.95
Friday. For the week, the average of 30 blue-chip stocks fell
55.85 points, or 2%. Broader averages took a harder fall for
the week: Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.7%, while
the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.5%. The
Dow Jones Equity Market index finished the week off 3.1%.
   Late buying related to the expiration of April stock-index
futures and options helped stocks close well above session
lows, traders said. The industrial average was off as much as
39 points during the session. Declining issues swamped
advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1079 to 401. Big
Board volume reached its highest level since March 22 as
174,260,000 shares changed hands.
   Citicorp fell 1/2 to 23 3/8 on 1.6 million shares. The
possible Moody's downgrading would affect $31 billion of the
company's securities, increase its short-term cost of funds
and dent its prestige.
   Among issues of other major banks, Chase Manhattan fell
5/8 to 27 on 1.3 million shares, Manufacturers Hanover
dropped 1 3/8 to 32, Chemical Banking lost 5/8 to 23 1/4 and
J.P. Morgan slid 3/8 to 33 5/8. First Chicago, which reported
first-quarter earnings about 45% below the previous year's
quarter, slipped 1/2 to 30 3/4.
   MNC Financial dropped 3/4 to 16 3/8 after reporting that
its first-quarter earnings were down 89% from a year earlier.
Other regional bank issues that posted sharp losses included
Bank of Boston, which went down 1 to 11 3/8 on 1.1 million
shares; Shawmut National, down 3/8 to 13 3/8; Wells Fargo,
down 1 1/4 to 68 3/4; Sovran Financial, down 1 1/8 to 30 1/2
and Citizens &amp; Southern, down 1/2 to 23 7/8.
   Insurance stocks also were weak, including Marsh &amp;
McLennan, which dropped 1 3/8 to 70 1/8 after its
first-quarter earnings failed to meet analysts' expectations.
Its net income for the period was about 7% higher than a year
ago.
   Elsewhere in the group, Cigna lost 5/8 to 48 3/8; Aetna
Life &amp; Casualty dropped 1 1/2 to 46 7/8; Lincoln National
fell 1 3/4 to 52 3/4 and General Re dropped 2 to 83 1/8.
American General eased 1/2 to 37 1/4; the company noted that
insurance regulators in Texas and two other states have ruled
that Torchmark's solicitation of proxies in its fight for
board seats violates state law.
   General Motors, a standout performer amid last week's
market decline, added 1/8 to 46 3/4 on 2.1 million shares. GM
has boosted prices for options, which could increase the cost
of some of its cars and trucks by as much as $100, despite
sluggish consumer demand.
   Commonwealth Edison lost 1/2 to 31 5/8 on 1.4 million
shares and traded as low as 30 3/8, a 52-week low, after
reporting that its earnings dropped 38% in the first quarter
from a year earlier. Recent analyst projections had called
for stronger earnings.
   Texas Utilities gained 3/8 to 33 1/2 as 1.6 million shares
changed hands. The staff of the Texas Public Utility
Commission recommended an annual rise of $422 million, or
9.78%, in the company's revenue.
   Caterpillar added 5/8 to 60 1/2. Although the company's
first-quarter net income dropped nearly 30% from a year
earlier, the results were better than most analysts had
expected.
