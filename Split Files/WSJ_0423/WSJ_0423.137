   These are excerpts from the dissent in last week's case on
the judicial power to tax. Supreme Court Justice Anthony
Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia. A related editorial
appears today {see: "REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial) Judge
George III" -- WSJ April 23, 1990}.

   The {Kansas City, Missouri, School District} plan adopted
by the Court provided that "every senior high school, every
middle school, and approximately one-half of the elementary
schools in the KCMSD will become magnet schools by the school
year 1991-92." . . .
   It comes as no surprise that the cost of this approach to
the remedy far exceeded KCMSD's budget, or for that matter,
its authority to tax. A few examples are illustrative.
Programs such as a "performing arts middle school," a
"technical magnet high school" that "will offer programs
ranging from heating and air conditioning to cosmetology to
robotics," were approved. The plan also included a "25 acre
farm and 25 acre wildland area" for science study. The Court
rejected various proposals by the State to make "capital
improvements necessary to eliminate health and safety hazards
and to provide a good learning environment," because these
proposals failed to "consider the criteria of suburban
comparability."
   The District Court stated: "This `patch and repair'
approach proposed by the State would not achieve suburban
comparability or the visual attractiveness sought by the
Court as it would result in floor coverings with unsightly
sections of mismatched carpeting and tile, and individual
walls possessing different shades of paint." Finding that
construction of new schools would result in more "attractive"
facilities than renovation of existing ones, the District
Court approved new construction at a cost ranging from $61.80
per square foot to $95.70 per square foot as distinct from
renovation at $45 per square foot. . . .
   The power of taxation is one that the federal judiciary
does not possess. In our system "the legislative department
alone has access to the pockets of the people," The
Federalist (J. Madison), for it is the legislature that is
accountable to them and represents their will. The authority
that would levy the tax at issue here shares none of these
qualities. Our federal judiciary, by design, is not
representative or responsible to the people in a political
sense; it is independent. Federal judges do not depend on the
popular will for their office. They may not even share the
burden of taxes they attempt to impose, for they may live
outside the jurisdiction their orders affect. And federal
judges have no fear that the competition for scarce public
resources could result in a diminution of their salaries. It
is not surprising that imposition of taxes by an authority so
insulated from public communication or control can lead to
deep feelings of frustration, powerlessness, and anger on the
part of taxpaying citizens. . . .
   Perhaps it is good educational policy to provide a school
district with the items included in the KCMSD capital
improvement plan, for example: high schools in which every
classroom will have air conditioning, an alarm system, and 15
microcomputers; a 2,000-square-foot planetarium; greenhouses
and vivariums; a 25-acre farm with an air-conditioned meeting
room for 104 people; a Model United Nations wired for
language translation; broadcast capable radio and television
studios with an editing and animation lab; a temperature
controlled art gallery; movie editing and screening rooms; a
3,500-square-foot dust-free diesel mechanics room;
1,875-square-foot elementary school animal rooms for use in a
Zoo Project; swimming pools; and numerous other facilities.
   But these items are a part of legitimate political debate
over educational policy and spending priorities, not the
constitution's command of racial equality. Indeed, it may be
that a mere 12-acre petting farm, or other corresponding
reductions in court-ordered spending, might satisfy
constitutional requirements, while preserving scarce public
funds for legislative allocation to other public needs, such
as paving streets, feeding the poor, building prisons, or
housing the homeless. Perhaps the KCMSD's Classical Greek
theme schools emphasizing forensics and self-government will
provide exemplary training in participatory democracy. But if
today's dicta become law, such lessons will be of little use
to students who grow up to become taxpayers.
