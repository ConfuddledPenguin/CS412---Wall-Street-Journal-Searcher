   Merck &amp; Co. proposed to make its prescription drugs
available at lower prices to Medicaid patients, but it isn't
clear that the plan will deflect federal and state pressure
to force the pharmaceutical industry to bring down drug
costs.
   Drug companies generally have refused to give price breaks
to Medicaid programs even while granting discounts to other
volume buyers. In the face of budget deficits and rising
prescription prices, legislators and health-care officials
are taking steps to control Medicaid spending on drugs.

   The Merck plan could be both a political and marketing
coup for the nation's leading drug company, and it could save
Medicaid programs nationwide a total of $30 million a year,
based on Merck's current sales. "Merck has taken an important
step away from the policies of greed and unfairness that
unfortunately characterize today's drug companies," said Sen.
David Pryor (D., Ark.), who is drafting legislation aimed at
reducing drug costs for Medicaid and Medicare recipients.
   But it is far from certain that Merck's proposal will
placate regulators or lead other companies to offer similar
plans. For one thing, in a number of states, the offer would
be good only if certain restrictions on Merck drugs are
removed.
   In addition, for the proposal to fend off federal and
state efforts to lower drug prices for the poor, other
companies would have to offer similar discount plans -- and
these would be more costly to competitors because they offer
steeper discounts to bulk purchasers than Merck does. Other
drug companies were studying the plan and hadn't any comment.
   The U.S. and the 50 states share the $50 billion annual
cost of providing medical care to the nation's 23 million
eligible poor. About 7% of Medicaid budgets, or $3.5 billion,
pays for prescription drugs, according to Merck. To control
costs, a dozen states, including California, which accounts
for about 10% of the U.S. prescription drug market, have
adopted formularies, or lists of approved drugs that qualify
for Medicaid payment. Doctors treating poor patients must
prescribe medicines from the formularies, or in some states,
seek special authorization to deviate from the list. Such
policies deny the poor access to many medicines available to
the rest of the country, Merck says.
   With Merck's plan, physicians can "prescribe what they
think is best for their poor patients, just as they do for
patients in the general public," said John L. Zabriskie,
president of Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme, the Rahway, N.J.,
company's U.S. prescription drug unit. Medicaid currently
accounts for 8% to 10% of Merck's estimated $3 billion of
U.S. sales.
   Under the program, states will get the best price Merck
offers to any customeras long as the state doesn't restrict
access to any Merck drugs. "If they limit access to any of
our products, they won't get the best price on any of our
products," Dr. Zabriskie said.
   Merck's biggest discounts, currently offered only to the
Veterans Administration and a few other federal agencies, are
about 7% to 13% less than Merck's regular wholesale prices,
according to industry estimates. That difference is one of
the lowest in the industry, thus savings from the discount
will be modest at best.
   Sanford Lugar, a pharmacist with New Jersey's Medicaid
program, said it was too early to tell how much Merck's plan
would save his state, but it is "a positive step," he said.
   "We're studying it," said Richard Iniguez, a top official
for MediCal, California's Medicaid program. "But of all
companies to present this {type of} proposal, Merck would
have the least to lose. If, for instance, Pfizer were making
this proposal, we'd have a little more interest."
   Many companies give 30% to 50% discounts on some drugs to
the VA, hospitals, health maintenance organizations and other
bulk pharmaceutical buyers, Mr. Iniguez said. For instance,
MediCal pays $27.83 for 30 tablets of Merck's Pepcid, an
ulcer drug, while the VA pays $24.26, about 13% less, says
Victor Walker, a MediCal pharmacist. By contrast, MediCal
pays $54.77 for 100 of SmithKline Beecham PLC's Tagamet ulcer
pills while the VA pays $27.65, a difference of nearly 50%.
   Drug companies haven't extended discounts to the poverty
programs in part because unlike the VA or big hospitals,
Medicaid doesn't take delivery of the medicines. Generally,
the programs reimburse pharmacists who order and dispense the
products. "Most Medicaid programs pay top dollar for their
drugs," says Mr. Iniguez.
   The California Legislature begins hearings this week on
several bills that would change the state's formulary. One
bill has points similar to those in the Merck proposal;
others would strengthen the hand of state officials in
negotiating prices and adding or removing drugs from the
formulary.
   Mr. Iniguez said that while the state uses its formulary
to control costs, drug companies consider the formulary an
important marketing tool for patented drugs and include the
notation "Approved by MediCal" in ads in medical journals.
"The competition to get your product on the formulary can be
quite intense," he said. "It opens up a market well beyond
MediCal."
   Merck's Pepcid is on California's formulary; Mevacor, a
cholesterol-lowering drug, isn't. Under Merck's plan, the
state would get a discount on both drugs as long as it lifted
restrictions against all Merck products. That would mean
California's poor would have easier access to Mevacor and it
probably would boost sales of the drug as well. The plan, Dr.
Zabriskie asserts, "is fair to the patient, to the states and
to us."
