   ("Annual golf-course maintenance is at a record of $27,744
a hole. . . ." -- WSJ news item)
                                                                                                       

   It seems like a lot of money
   To take care of a piece of earth,
   But for the time spent on each hole
   I am getting my money's worth.

collated and stapled them]
