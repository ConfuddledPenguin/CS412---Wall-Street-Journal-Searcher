   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said it will idle its Lorain,
Ohio, assembly plant for a week starting next Monday, citing
a shortage of orders for the Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar
cars built there.
   The auto maker said it already had factored the temporary
closing into its previously announced, second-quarter
production schedules. A Ford spokesman said the market for
midsized, sporty two-door coupes, such as those built in the
Lorain plant, has been weaker than the car market in general
this year.

   The Lorain plant has about 2,700 hourly employees and
produces 5,600 cars a week, using two shifts.
   Separately, Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan confirmed that Ford
reduced by 6,000 the number of cars it will order from
Mazda's U.S. assembly plant, in Flat Rock, Mich., in May.
Mazda builds the Probe model there for Ford, as well as Mazda
MX-6s and 626s. The plant produced 19,344 cars last month,
down 8% from a year earlier.
   Mazda said the reduction won't result in layoffs for any
of the 2,900 hourly employees at the plant. But the company
said it is uncertain whether it will continue to employ
temporary workers there. Mazda won't specify how many
temporary employees it has, but union officials have put the
number at about 100.
   Mazda said it plans to meet the production cut by
operating the line fewer hours. While the assembly line is
idled, the Mazda workers will participate in additional
training programs.
