   Racial segregation inside school buildings creates
inferior opportunities for black and Hispanic students to
learn mathematics and science, according to a new study by
Rand Corp.
   The study, one of the largest-scale reports on separate
instruction for separate ability groups, found that
disproportionately high numbers of blacks and Hispanics are
assigned to low-ability mathematics and science classes,
while few minorities gain entry to high-ability classes. In
addition, the study said low-ability classes are taught by
less-qualified teachers and receive fewer resources, such as
laboratory equipment.

   Aside from the potential social damage alleged in the
study, the findings could also bode ill for the economy. By
the year 2000, the U.S. Labor Department says, minorities
will grow to about 26% of the labor pool from 20% currently,
while employers will need more people with sophisticated
mathematics and science training. The study by Rand, a Santa
Monica, Calif., public-policy research center, suggests that
many future workers won't have this training.
   Racial discrepancies in advanced and slow-track classes
have produced controversy on the local level, notably in
Selma, Ala. There, supporters of a black superintendent
charged that his efforts to reduce the segregative effects of
ability-grouping, or tracking, helped lead to the non-renewal
of his contract by a white-majority school board.
   Using a National Science Foundation survey of 1,200
schools and 6,000 teachers, researchers at Rand found
tracking in science and mathematics to be pervasive
nationally, with potentially wide-scale damage to black and
Hispanic learning. Between kindergarten and sixth grade, Rand
found 65% of math and science classes are classified as
fast-track, medium-track, or slow-track, with only 35%
containing students of mixed abilities. From seventh through
12th grade, single-ability classes were 80% of the total.
   "This is the Selma story -- but everywhere in the
country," says Jeannie Oakes, one of the authors of the
study, who previewed a portion of the work at a conference in
Boston on Friday. "The differences we found are not efforts
to fine-tune instruction to meet the needs of kids, but gross
differences in the allocation of school resources."
   At elementary schools that are 90% to 100% minority, the
study found that low-ability classes account for 28% of
science and math courses, with only 9% of classes classified
as high-ability. Conversely, for grade schools that are 90%
or more white, only 7% of classes are low-level and 11% are
high-level. In high school, the differences are even more
striking, with advanced classes making up 34% of heavily
white schools' math and science curriculum; at heavily
minority high schools, only 12% of the science and math
offerings are advanced classes.
   At mixed-race schools, blacks and Hispanics were also
over-represented in low-level classes when compared with the
schools' total racial makeup, and under-represented in
high-level classes. In two out of three slow-track high
school classes, the minority enrollment was higher than that
of the school as a whole. The figures were based on
educators' actual counts of students, but Rand didn't release
the exact numbers.
   Middle schools and high schools have traditionally offered
students at the same grade level courses of different
difficulty, with one of the classic choices being first-year
algebra or a simpler arithmetic course in ninth grade.
Assignments or teachers' steering of students at this level
are often based on past grade and test records. But Ms. Oakes
says it was "astonishing" to see the high level of tracking
and racial differentiation even in kindergarten through sixth
grade classes, when an academic track record is much less
established. Stratification in these years, she said, seems
much more likely to be based, consciously or unconsciously,
on a student's race.
   The bulk of research on ability grouping suggests that
more intelligent students may achieve slightly more in the
long run when they are separated from slower students, but
slower students' achievement suffers significantly. Surveys
of teachers have shown they support ability grouping for
several reasons, especially because it reduces their need to
repeat certain lessons for slower students when brighter
students are ready to move on.
   But the practice is growing more controversial. Although
there have been few successful lawsuits alleging
discrimination via ability grouping, Norman Chachkin, an
attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, says the Office of
Civil Rights of the U.S. Education Department has brought
several administrative actions against districts where racial
patterns are pronounced at differing ability levels. However,
critics have found it hard to convince courts that placements
are being made on racial grounds, and not on the basis of
demonstrated ability.
   One area where the Rand report may add fuel to the dispute
is in resources. For some time, a general shortage of math
and science teachers has meant that instructors uncertified
in these fields have been permitted to teach them. But Ms.
Oakes and her colleagues found that only 39% of teachers of
low-ability classes at largely minority secondary schools had
certification or bachelor's degrees in math or science,
compared with 84% for advanced classes at schools with white
majorities. Availability of science laboratories and
equipment was also scarcer at schools with more low-track
classes.
   "This is institutional discrimination," Mr. Chachkin says.
"The consensus among educators for some time has been that
the disadvantages of tracking outweigh the advantages, yet
the practice remains tremendously resilient to change."
