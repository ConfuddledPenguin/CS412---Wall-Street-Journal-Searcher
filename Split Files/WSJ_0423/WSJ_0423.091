   NEW YORK -- GTE Corp., tightening the phone industry's
grip on cellular communications, agreed to buy Providence
Journal Co.'s cellular properties in the Southeast U.S. for
$710 million in cash.
   GTE is the nation's fifth-largest cellular operator, with
licenses covering 23 million potential subscribers -- POPs in
industry jargon -- in 34 metropolitan markets. The Providence
Journal's operations will add 3.5 million POPs in 12 markets
in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Virginia and
about 40,000 actual subscribers to GTE's current base of
263,000 customers.

   "This will add a nicely clustered, nice demographic region
in the Southeast" to GTE's Southeast operations in Florida,
said Terry S. Parker, president of GTE Mobile Communications
Group, which runs GTE Mobilnet, the cellular company, and
AirFone, an operator of phone service on airliners. GTE's
other regions of coverage are the Midwest, Southwest and
West.
   At the Providence Journal, Jack C. Clifford, vice
president of the company's broadcast and cable television
properties, said the company decided to sell the Southeast
cellular properties, "primarily because we're a media-based
company . . . and feel more comfortable in those businesses."
The proceeds, he said, will probably be used to expand the
Providence Journal's already considerable newspaper and cable
TV operations and perhaps buy new ones.
   GTE's purchase marks the first time it has purchased
another company to expand its operations. It probably won't
be the last time, either, said Mr. Parker. "We're not
committed to anything else yet, but if anything comes up we
might do it," he said.
   The takeover also strengthens the role of local phone
companies in the cellular business. While McCaw Cellular
Communications, an independent cellular operator, is the
nation's largest, with 53.9 million POPs, local phone
companies dominate the business in terms of total licenses.
In fact, with this acquisition, local phone companies now
hold slightly more than two-thirds of the cellular licenses
in the U.S.
   Mr. Parker said the purchase will be financed by
short-term borrowings and won't have any impact on GTE's
earnings this year and probably only about a 3% dilution in
1991. The corporation posted net income of $1.4 billion on
revenue of $17.4 billion in 1989.
   "We're so big that this is kind of a little hump for our
finance people," said Mr. Parker.
   That says a lot about the state of cellular industry
takeover action and property values. The market for creative
financing such as junk bonds -- which many smaller players
used to get their start and expand in the business -- has
grown tight. And, as GTE's all-cash agreement indicates, the
tight credit market enables big players such as GTE and the
regional Bell companies to flex their financial muscle and
pick up potentially lucrative properties without overpaying.
   "The industry fundamentals remain spectacular . . . {but}
prices for properties have stalled because of the {current}
bank environment," said Dennis H. Leibowitz, analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Nonetheless, GTE paid about $207 per POP for the
Providence Journal's business, including $57 million in
network facilities. That's almost as much as Contel Corp., a
midsized regional, paid per POP for potentially more
lucrative properties in the Southeast owned by McCaw Cellular
Communications in a $1.3 billion deal last February.
   "The industry should feel very good about this deal.
You're getting better-financed, stronger players," said
Haynes Griffin, president of Vanguard Cellular Systems Inc.,
Greensboro, N.C., a rival bidder for the Providence Journal
business and an owner of cellular licenses from New England
to Florida.
   While Mr. Clifford declined to comment, industry sources
said other bidders for the Providence Journal properties
included BellSouth Corp., the Atlanta-based Baby Bell;
Philadelphia-based Comcast, a cable TV operator; and Metro
Mobile CTS Inc., a Manhattan-based independent cellular
company.
   Mr. Clifford did say that the Providence Journal's
cellular properties "overall weren't profitable," but he
declined to provide revenues and income figures.
   GTE Mobilnet had revenue of $224.3 million in 1989, a 39%
increase from 1988's $161.6 million. The company doesn't
break out profit numbers, but Mr. Parker said it has been
profitable since 1988. A GTE spokesman said that if sales of
cellular phones are subtracted, service revenue grew 64% last
year, about in line with the industry. And GTE's subscriber
base, excluding the customers it serves as a reseller in some
markets, hit 232,000 in 1989, an 82% increase, almost 20%
better than the industry average compiled by the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association.
