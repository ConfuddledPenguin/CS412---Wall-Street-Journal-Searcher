   SURAT THANI, Thailand -- For more than a year, Thai
officials have been pursuing a plan to create an
international trade route across the country's isthmus -- a
plan that is remarkable for both the scope of its ambition
and the degree of skepticism it has aroused.
   The Southern Seaboard Development Program, approved by the
Thai cabinet in early 1989, would involve building a
180-kilometer "land bridge" of high-speed rail and highway
links, pipelines and ports to transport crude oil and
containers across the isthmus. Industrial estates on either
side of the isthmus would produce and assemble goods for
domestic and international trade. Offshore pipelines from
wells in the Gulf of Thailand would be used for gas-related
industries.

   The land bridge would run from Krabi on the Andaman Sea to
Khanom on the Gulf of Thailand and is meant to cut hundreds
of kilometers off shipping routes between Middle Eastern and
Far Eastern ports. Planners speculate that the Southern
Seaboard would cost $10 billion and probably take through the
end of the century to complete.
   Government officials, who decline to comment on the cost,
think the project will further Thailand's aspirations to over
take Singapore as a regional center for oil refining, trade
and industry, as well as draw traffic from Indonesian sea
lanes.
   "This project means the internationalization of Thailand,"
says Savit Bhotiwihok, the director of a cabinet-level
committee overseeing the proposal. "We can't afford not to do
this kind of planning. It is engineerable, it is
financeable."
   There have been signs in recent weeks that the proposal is
shifting out of the abstract planning stage. But some
observers argue that even if the Southern Seaboard starts to
attract solid private-sector commitments, it could still fall
victim to the bureaucratic delays, confusion and infighting
that have plagued other Thai projects.
   Moreover, Mr. Savit says that the government expects
private enterprise to bear a good deal of the infrastructural
cost. "This is not like having the government provide
infrastructure, then waiting around for people to use it," he
says.
   But some observers in the shipping, oil and construction
industries believe the project represents the triumph of
political fancy over commercial reality. The lukewarm
response makes it questionable how many companies will join
the project.
   "I think most of us feel the money and resources should be
spent on the Eastern Seaboard," says a container-shipping
executive.
   The Eastern Seaboard Development Program has been under
way for seven years and involves natural-gas plants,
industrial estates, telecommunications facilities and a
deep-sea port about 120 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. The
complex is close to completion, much nearer to Thailand's
urban areas, and, businessmen say, much more practical as a
site for multinational assembly plants.
   Skeptics note that the Southern Seaboard project would
require carving two entirely new cities out of what is now
undeveloped rural terrain at a time when the money would be
better spent by both government and private enterprise on
fixing infrastructure problems, affecting highways,
telecommunications, rail lines and ports, that are close to
strangling Bangkok.
   Some businessmen also question how much time or money
would be saved by shortening the sea lanes for shipping
concerns and the goods they haul. A Bangkok-based
oil-industry executive whose company studied the feasibility
of the project says that as far as transporting crude, any
savings in time and money attributable to shortening the sea
route from the Middle East to Japan would be largely offset
by the extra handling costs of unloading and reloading the
oil on either side of the isthmus and by the pumping time
required to move crude through a 180-kilometer pipeline.
   In addition, a company using the pipeline would have to
contribute toward its construction costs, which the executive
estimates at $60 million.
   "It's not attractive to go in as an investor on a
pipeline," the executive says.
   Nor do container-shipping executives see any additional
benefit. The land bridge and container ports would run up
against the efficiency of the Port of Singapore Authority,
which in 10 hours can unload a ship hauling 1,000 containers.
Singapore expects to expand to a new, second container port
with five full berths and four feeder berths by 1992, a Port
Authority spokeswoman says, giving the Thais tough
competition long before the land bridge is even begun.
   "It is probably more attractive to continue to move cargo
via the Malacca Strait," says the Bangkok-based managing
director of a Western container-shipping line. "You're not
cutting a large amount of voyage time {by crossing Thailand's
land bridge}, and you would need significant additional
capital investment. I would be surprised if cutting off that
much time or mileage saved anything at all."
   Environmentalists and tourism executives also are
concerned that the project, with its harbors, oil tankers and
assembly plants, could befoul some of Asia's most popular
tourism destinations -- the islands of Phuket, Phi Phi and
Samui and the beach at Krabi. Tourism, the country's largest
single source of foreign exchange, brought in an estimated 95
billion baht ($3.7 billion) in 1989, according to Bangkok
Bank.
