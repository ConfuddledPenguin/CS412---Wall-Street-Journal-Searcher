   WASHINGTON -- The best piece of evidence for the case that
the economic glass is half full, rather than half empty, is
the unemployment rate. At last tally, the jobless rate was
5.2%, near a 15-year low. And it has been at about that level
for more than a year. Yet, manufacturers have let nearly
250,000 workers go in the past year and enough retailers are
in trouble to hold a spring convention in bankruptcy court.
What goes on?
   Sure, the economy has escaped a recession so far, but its
growth has slowed enough to cause computers at the
forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill to predict an upturn in
the jobless rate by now. Likewise, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan has been anticipating greater unemployment
with the sluggish economic growth.

   The low jobless rate partly reflects the economy's
continuing expansion, of course. But the unexpectedly low
level may also reflect long-term forces at work within the
economy. Unrelated to the business cycle's periodic ups and
downs, these forces include slowing labor-force growth, a
shrinking economic role for manufacturers and harder
productivity gains -- along with skill or luck at the Fed.
                                                                                                       

   The impact of demographics on the labor force can be seen
in a few statistics. With the youngest baby boomers turning
26 this year, fewer young people are looking for their first
adult jobs. In the past 12 months, the labor force -- those
working or looking for work -- grew only 1.3%, down from 1.7%
a year in the 1980s and 2.4% in the 1970s.
   "We don't have to create so many jobs just to stand
still," says Janet Norwood, U.S. commissioner of labor
statistics.
   Remember candidate George Bush's pledge to create 30
million jobs during his presidency? He doesn't talk about it
any more. The latest Economic Report of the President instead
calls for more immigration to ease an anticipated labor
shortage.
   The jobless rate could edge up a few tenths of a percent
at any time, of course -- or more if a bona fide recession
develops. But if the economy continues at its current
plodding pace, as most forecasters expect, the jobless rate
is likely to remain low.
   Roger Brinner of DRI/McGraw-Hill figures the economy need
grow only 2.5% a year to keep the rate steady. "Back in the
'60s, you needed 4 1/4% growth," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Not only is the labor force growing more slowly, but
productivity growth is lagging, in part because productivity
gains normally come hardest in service jobs, whose
labor-force role keeps expanding. If productivity were to
grow faster, employers could get by with fewer workers -- and
unemployment would be higher.
                                                                                                       

   The low unemployment rate seems especially strange when
headlines tell of manufacturing layoffs. But manufacturing
may get more attention than it warrants nowadays. In large
measure, this is because the numbers spinning from
Washington's statistics mills are overweighted with data
about the factory economy, whose role on the business scene
has diminished over the years.
   A glance at Pittsburgh is instructive. Like much of
manufacturing, steel is in a slump. Yet, the Pittsburgh
area's unemployment rate is below the national average and
has risen only slightly in recent months. The explanation is
that only 3% of the area's jobs are still tied to steel. In
fact, manufacturing of all kinds accounts for less than 14%
of the area's jobs, down from 25% a decade ago.
   While factories across the country have cut payrolls, the
rest of the economy has created more than 2.7 million jobs in
the past year. The ups and downs of interest rates or the
dollar may trouble many manufacturers, but such movements
generally mean less to hospitals or fast-food outlets.
   As an indicator of overall economic conditions, the
unemployment rate is far from perfect. It counts only people
looking for jobs and ignores those who have lost hope of ever
finding work or have been forced to retire early.
                                                                                                       

   Right now, moreover, the numbers are unusually muddled.
The Labor Department's monthly survey of households, from
which the jobless rate is calculated, found 1.25 million more
people with jobs in March 1990 than in March 1989. But
employers report that they added almost twice as many in the
same 12 months. Even allowing for a big increase in
moonlighting -- which swells the employers' tallies without
boosting the count from the household survey -- the
discrepancy is a mystery.
                                                                                                       

   The national unemployment rate is, in addition, an average
that masks high joblessness in some regions. But as long as
weakness in New England, say, is offset by improvement in
Texas, the overall jobless rate may not change, and the Fed's
stated strategy is to achieve just such a balance.
   A low rate of unemployment, it should be added, can make
the Fed's job somewhat easier, since if joblessness is low,
the Fed is usually under less political pressure to push down
interest rates.
