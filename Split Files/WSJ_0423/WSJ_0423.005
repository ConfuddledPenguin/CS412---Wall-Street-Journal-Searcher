   For Iraq's Saddam Hussein, there's no such thing as a
"peace dividend."
   Although it is 20 months since Iraq concluded a ceasefire
with Iran, an estimated one million Iraqis remain in uniform,
and the khaki-clad president continues a weapons-buying spree
unmatched by any other world leader.

   Iraq has been the world's largest importer of arms during
the past five years, accounting for more than 9% of
world-wide arms purchases. The shopping list ranges from
advanced combat aircraft to experimental missile technology
and an apparent attempt to join the ranks of nuclear-armed
nations. All this from a nation that still hasn't signed a
peace treaty with Iran, that remains technically at war with
Israel, and that is playing out a long-term feud with Syria
through proxies in Lebanon's civil war.
   "The lesson that Iraq learned as the {Gulf} war progressed
was that toughness paid," says a Western ambassador who
served in Baghdad during the fighting. "It didn't matter that
it used methods seen as ungentlemanly in the West -- it
didn't forfeit Western standing."
   Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran and its own
Kurdish citizens, raising little Western ire. It has a vast
stockpile of such weapons, which it has threatened to use on
Israel if that state launches a strike on Iraq's military
industries.
   "If an insect tries to advance towards Iraq or wage
aggression against it, we will cut its tail from the back,
its head from the front and leave only its middle," Mr.
Hussein recently declared, in an apparent reference to
Israel.
   Iraq lobbed long-range missiles on civilian targets in
Iran and says it is developing a missile with a range of
1,250 miles -- bringing all of its enemies within reach. It
also has more than 700 combat aircraft, including the
most-recent Soviet fighter planes, according to Zeev Eytan, a
specialist on the Middle East's military balance at the
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv. It wants to
buy the Mirage 2000, a plane comparable to the U.S. F-16.
   In 1981, an Israeli air strike on an incomplete Iraqi
nuclear reactor stalled what may have been an early attempt
to acquire nuclear weapons. However, Iraq still has enriched
uranium supplied by France, and last month's British and
U.S.-coordinated seizure of krytrons -- possible nuclear
detonators -- indicates renewed efforts to build a nuclear
bomb.
   What a dictatorship on such a spree probably is trying to
do is skirt international weapons-sales restrictions, says
John Simpson, an arms-control expert at the University of
Southampton in England. "If you can't get X, well then, buy Y
and Z when it comes along," he says. Such an approach takes
advantage of sales competition among industrial countries,
who aren't collaborating to prevent a prohibited system being
pieced together from a range of scattered parts.
   Gerald Bull, an American ballistics expert with strong
ties to the arms trade, may have peddled his "supergun" to
the Iraqis as "a prestige weapon" -- the biggest, and
something the West doesn't have, says Mr. Simpson. (On March
22, Mr. Bull was shot five times outside his Brussels
apartment. His killer hasn't been found.)
   Such a sales pitch would be particularly appealing to
Hussein Kamil, the Iraqi president's son-in-law and minister
in charge of the country's vast military industrialization.
"The more exotic the technology, the more Kamil is
interested," says a former state department official who
follows Iraqi affairs. "If you take a character like {Gerald}
Bull with a fixation . . . and put him together with Hussein
Kamil who seems to share this fascination with exotic weapons
and has the funding for it, it makes sense that you come up
with something like this" enormous gun.
   Avraham Bar-David, project manager for the Israeli
artillery specialists, Soltam Ltd., says such a gun gets
around Israel's air superiority, is simpler than missile
technology and easier to protect.
   While such a gun clearly would be immobile, much of it
would be concealed below ground and wouldn't require the
cumbersome pre-launch preparation that gives a target nation
warning of an impending missile attack. Loaded with a
chemical or nuclear warhead, a single firing could do vast
damage.
   Asked how a country could defend against such a weapon,
Mr. Bar-David replies: "Prevent it being installed."
