   ISLAMORADA, Fla. -- President Bush proposed to ban
shipping from a wide swath of the southern Florida coast to
protect sensitive coral reefs from pollution and ship
groundings.
   Mr. Bush made the announcement as part of his observance
of Earth Day during a Florida fishing vacation. His proposal
would establish an "area to be avoided" approximately 10
miles off the Florida coast and five miles off the reef. The
measure would ban vessels larger than 50 meters in length, or
those carrying oil or hazardous materials, from entering the
area. The area extends from Key Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas.

   The administration's proposal must be forwarded to the
International Maritime Organization for approval. While the
measure doesn't carry the rule of law, adoption by the body
indicates that 128 member nations intend for ships registered
to those countries to abide by the guidelines. International
accord is necessary, according to officials, because the reef
line lies five to seven miles off the shoreline, beyond U.S.
domestic shipping jurisdiction.
   The action follows three ship groundings off the reef line
last fall. No hazardous materials were spilled, but the ships
caused extensive damage to the reefs, which Mr. Bush called
"one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world and a unique
national treasure."
