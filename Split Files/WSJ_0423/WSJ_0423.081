   GOLDEN, Colo. -- Spurred by an increase of nearly 30% in
beer shipments, Adolph Coors Co. posted its highest
first-quarter earnings since 1983, despite a large charge in
its non-brewing businesses.
   For the 12-week period ended March 25, the nation's third
largest brewer reported net income of $7.7 million, or 21
cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.8
million, or 13 cents a share. The latest earnings include a
charge of $7 million, or 12 cents a share, for costs relating
to staff reductions at the company's ceramics unit. Sales
totaled $394.3 million, up 22% from $324.1 million a year
ago. Coors Brewing Co., the company's brewing unit, shipped a
first-quarter record of 3,980,000 barrels, up 30% from the
year-earlier period.

   The company said gains were paced by its Coors Light
brand, which continued to show double-digit increases, and by
hefty sales of Keystone, the popular-priced brand introduced
in the fall. "Coors is on a roll," said Emanuel Goldman,
analyst for PaineWebber Inc., San Francisco.
   The generous increase in sales indicates a turnaround for
the company, which ran into tough times during the 1980s. It
was nearly disastrously slow to pick up on the marketing
slugfest initiated by Miller Brewing Co. and Anheuser-Busch
Cos. In addition, the company's flagship Coors brand lost its
marketing niche and its mystique as the company rolled it out
nationally, expanding its market from 11 Western states.
Increased shipping costs and marketing costs eroded margins.
   The first quarter generated a host of good news for Coors.
The best news, Mr. Goldman said, is that Keystone apparently
isn't cannibalizing sales of Coors or Coors Light, as some
had feared. While the flagship Coors beer continued to
decline, the drop has apparently slowed, according to
analysts and a company spokesman.
   The large increase in a virtually flat market means that
Coors's growing brands are stealing drinkers from other beer
companies. G. Heileman Brewing Co. and Stroh Brewery Co. have
both been losing market share in recent years and much of the
increases may be coming at the expense of those brewers. But
recent extremely competitive price cutting by Anheuser-Busch
may indicate that even the tough No. 1 brewer sees the
possibility of erosion of its market share.
   In addition, Coors's significantly higher sales volume
cuts the company's fixed costs per barrel, which has been
higher than the industry average because it brews its beer
longer than other brewers. The increased sales volume will
help fund the big marketing expenses required to compete in
the highly competitive beer market, especially at a time
Coors is engaged in the price-cutting war in many major
markets with Anheuser-Busch, the nation's largest brewer, and
the second-largest beer maker, Miller Brewing Co., a unit of
Philip Morris Cos.
   But the gains also raise concerns. The huge increase in
shipments, for example, is straining the company's capacity
at its single brewery in Golden. Last year, the brewery came
up against its capacity constraints of 20 million barrels a
year when it shipped 17.7 million barrels. This year, the
company may have trouble producing enough beer to meet
traditionally heavy second quarter demand.
   "We're stretching, let's put it that way," said a company
spokesman. Coors attempted to buy Stroh late last year, which
would have given the company some additional plants, but the
deal fell apart when the companies apparently disagreed on
price.
   The company said all of its businesses, including the
brewery, Coors Technology Cos. and Coors Ceramics Co.,
started picking up in the second half of last year, and
continued in the first quarter. Golden Aluminum Co. and
Graphic Packaging Corp., units of Coors Technology, posted
"particularly strong results for the quarter," the company
said. Segment results aren't available. Coors Ceramics
reported record sales, but the unit posted a loss because of
the charge for early retirement and voluntary severance
incentive programs intended to shrink its payroll.
