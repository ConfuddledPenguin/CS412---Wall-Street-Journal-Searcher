   SEOUL -- Disgruntled stock investors, shouting "Down with
{President} Roh Tae-woo," demonstrated Friday to protest the
lack of government measures to boost the sagging South Korean
market, witnesses said.
   Police said they arrested eight protesters.

   At least two people were injured when about 200 investors
began hurling stacks of papers, booklets and chairs at
several stock trading offices in Seoul, the witnesses said.
   The composite index, the main measure of the Korea Stock
Exchange, has been falling sharply in the past several days,
dropping to 767.45 Friday, the lowest level since November
1988.
   Analysts blamed the market's decline on the sluggish
economy. Exports, on which the Korean economy depends
heavily, fell nearly 3% in the quarter ended March 31 from a
year earlier.
   Despite the gloomy economic outlook, the government ruled
out any short-term measures to boost the market.
