   New York -- "The Piano Lesson" opened at the Yale
Repertory Theater in the fall of 1987. In reviewing the
production in December of that year, I praised both the play
and its author, August Wilson. "The Piano Lesson," I wrote,
"shows a sure instinct for drama. Mr. Wilson's ear for the
speech of black Americans is unfailing: his rhythms,
inflections and vocabulary capture perfectly not only the
regionalisms but the rich verbal lore of his characters. He
also has his own special brand of humor." Referring to his
other plays, "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," "Fences" and "Joe
Turner's Come and Gone," I concluded that "The Piano Lesson"
would "take its place alongside his other works in this
remarkable series of plays about the black experience in
20th-century America."
   Now, 2 1/2 years later, "The Piano Lesson" has been
declared the winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for drama;
four days after the Pulitzer announcement, the play opened on
Broadway. The two events, coming so long after the play's
initial production, underscore the bizarre nature of the
Pulitzer drama award, especially as it affects regional
theaters.

   In the late 1970s and early '80s, I served several times
on the Pulitzer committee that recommended a best play of the
year. In two of those years, when I was chairman of the
committee, officials of the Pulitzer Prize came under intense
pressure from regional theaters and from critics on
newspapers outside New York City to make plays produced in
regional theaters eligible for the prize. (In the past, the
award had been given to the best play opening in New York
City during the year.) While I was very sympathetic to the
argument, I pointed out the impracticality of putting it into
effect. It's true that the Pulitzer is a national award, but
theatrical productions, unlike music, which can be heard on
tape, must be seen to be judged properly. To be fair to the
many new plays produced at professional theaters across the
country the three-person drama committee would have to spend
365 days a year on the road, making certain it saw every play
that was eligible.
   The problem went deeper than that, however. The prize is
not actually awarded by the various committees in the arts,
but by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which consists of 16 voting
members, most of them publishers, editors and the like, who
do not feel obliged to follow the recommendations of their
committees. To be scrupulously honest, these 16 men and women
also would have to crisscross the country to see every single
production of a new play mounted by a regional theater.
   My conclusion was that though it smacked of provincialism,
the least unfair way of judging the best play was to stick
with those produced in a given year in New York City. While
it was admittedly not an ideal solution, it was at least a
forthright one, not leading to the hypocrisy of suggesting
that both the three-person panel and 16-member board had
actually given a full and fair hearing to each new play that
opened in the U.S. My argument did not prevail, and ever
since there has been the pretense that productions nationwide
are given equal consideration.
   Now comes this year's award. I hasten to say that I am not
for one moment questioning the choice of "The Piano Lesson"
as a play worthy of the prize; after all, I saw great merit
in it in 1987. But in which year should it have been eligible
for the award? According to the Pulitzer board's policy of
including regional-theater productions, it should have been
1988. Or has it decided to make this a floating contest,
making a play eligible in whatever year the board whimsically
chooses? And is this fair to plays actually opening that
year?
   After its initial production at Yale, "The Piano Lesson"
was given professional productions in Boston, Chicago, San
Diego, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. It could have been
eligible, therefore, not only in 1988, but in 1989; for that
matter, if it had not won this year, why not in future years
when it is produced in other regional theaters across the
country? The arrangement whereby the Pulitzer board asks
experts in the arts to make recommendations and then reserves
the right to ignore them has always been a bit supercilious,
but with this latest development in drama, the process enters
the realm of the absurd.
   As for "The Piano Lesson," through more than two years and
six major productions it has remained much the same, with its
many strengths as well as a few weaknesses. The theme of the
play is beautifully dramatized. Boy Willie and Berniece are a
brother and sister whose forbears were slaves in Mississippi.
At one point in the family history, a mother and her son were
traded by their owners to another family in exchange for a
piano, but a later ancestor, a woodcarver, reclaimed the
piano as an important reminder of the family heritage. To
create a lasting memorial, he carved the faces and figures of
family members into the front panels and legs of the piano.
   The play takes place many years later, in 1936 in
Pittsburgh, where Berniece has moved to live with her uncle
Doaker (Carl Gordon), a railroad conductor who owns a house
there. With her, Berniece has brought her daughter, Meretha
(Apryl R. Foster), and the piano. Berniece's brother, Boy
Willie, has remained in Mississippi as a farmer, but now he
has a chance to buy a farm of his own -- from the family on
whose land his ancestors have always worked. Boy Willie has
come North with his friend Lymon (Rocky Carroll) to sell the
piano and take his half share so that he can buy the farm,
but Berniece refuses to sell: The piano is an icon, a family
emblem.
   It is a classic dilemma: Boy Willie, portrayed with
super-charged energy and mesmerizing charm by Charles S.
Dutton, is certain his father would want him to sell the
piano to look to the future; Berniece, played with calm
determination and assurance by S. Epatha Merkerson, is
convinced it would be desecration against the past to do so.
No playwright working today can create confrontations such as
those between Boy Willie and Berniece, or such tender love
scenes as one between Berniece and Lymon, or such comical
love scenes as one involving Boy Willie and a lady of the
evening (Lisa Gay Hamilton) with more authority and stage
magic than Mr. Wilson. As with his previous plays, the actors
are expertly guided by director Lloyd Richards.
   As to its weak points, the play still is too long, and a
ghost that appears at the top of the stairs remains a
problem.
   A final note: "The Piano Lesson" is the first occupant of
the former Ritz theater, now grandly restored and renamed
after Walter Kerr, the well-known drama critic. Its owners,
the Jujamcyn Organization, say they are dedicating it to new
American plays. The policy has made an auspicious debut with
"The Piano Lesson."
