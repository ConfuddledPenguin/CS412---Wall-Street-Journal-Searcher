   TAIPEI -- Export orders for Taiwanese products increased
to $5.93 billion in March, up 18% from February but down 5.2%
from March 1989, the Economics Ministry said.
   The ministry said the higher number of working days in
March contributed to the monthly gain. Furthermore, March
usually is a big month for export orders, it said.

jumped to $1.43 billion in March from $1.12 billion in
February, while orders for shoes rose to $417 million from

   For the quarter ended March 31, export orders fell to
$15.88 billion from $16.35 billion a year earlier.
