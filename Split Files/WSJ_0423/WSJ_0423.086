   A federal judge in Anchorage expanded the liability of
ship owners and operators in Alaskan pipeline oil spills. The
ruling is the first to interpret whether the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline Act of 1973 superseded a 19th century law that
limited a shipper's exposure to the cost of a vessel and its
cargo.
   U.S. District Court Judge H. Russel Holland dismissed a
claim brought by Trinidad Corp., a St. Louis shipper that
hired the S.S. Glacier Bay, which struck a rock and spilled
almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet Bay in
Alaska on July 2, 1987. Commercial fishermen and fish
processors filed suit in federal court asking for more than
$104.8 million from Trinidad Corp. and British Petroleum PLC,
which had hired Trinidad to ship its oil.

   The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act provides that the owner or
operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay
plaintiffs the first $14 million in damages. After that, the
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Liability Fund, which is funded by oil
companies, is obligated to pay the next $86 million in
damages. Both the shipper and the fund are liable for the
damages.
   But it was unclear whether a negligent shipper would be
liable to plaintiffs for additional damages or whether the
fund could recoup the $86 million from a negligent shipper.
   Trinidad filed a complaint with the court arguing that the
19th century law limited its liability under a negligence
claim to no more than $6.55 million, the cost of the vessel
and the cargo.
   In a rare partnership, the plaintiffs and the oil
companies filed to have Trinidad's complaint dismissed.
   "Judge Holland's order is the pivotal ruling in the
Glacier Bay litigation," says plaintiffs' attorney Gerard M.
Nolting of Faegre &amp; Benson in Minneapolis. "The shipping
industry will have great difficulty in the future in limiting
its liability in oil spill litigation in cases arising out of
Trans-Alaskan oil spills and others governed by statutes
similar to the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Act."
   Trinidad declined to comment.

   JUDGE RULES that actuaries' relationships with their
clients aren't privileged.
   The decision means that information from a partner at
Kwasha Lipton, an actuarial firm in Fort Lee, N.J., can be
used in a suit against West Point-Pepperell Inc., owned by
investor William Farley. Fruit of the Loom Inc., also owned
by Mr. Farley, is a big client of Kwasha. Kwasha had argued
that use of the information posed a conflict of interest for
the firm. In the case, a former official of a company
acquired by Mr. Farley is suing for compensation.
   In what U.S. District Judge Kenneth Conboy in Manhattan
called an "extraordinary proposition," the Kwasha partner
asked to withdraw an affidavit he had voluntarily submitted
in the case. The actuary said he didn't know at the time that
the case was against a company related to one of his firm's
clients.
   Kwasha claimed that actuaries have a confidential
relationship with their client that must be protected just as
attorney-client relationships are protected. Actuaries
provide services such as calculating statistics for insurance
and pension plans.
   But Judge Conboy rejected the request. "It is clear that
the New York courts and legislators have not thought that the
benefits of protecting the confidences between an actuary and
a client or an accountant and a client are great enough to
create a statutory or common law privilege," the judge said
in his ruling. The judge said that if New York law recognized
a privilege between accountants and their clients, it would
be feasible that the same protection could be extended to
actuaries.
   Kwasha officials declined to comment. Attorneys for West
Point-Pepperell couldn't be reached for comment.
   Robert Krumme, the former official who filed the suit,
worked at Cluett Peabody &amp; Co. from 1969 to 1986, when it was
acquired by West Point-Pepperell.

   SURVEY SAYS 1989 legal fees rose sharply in directors' and
officers' liability cases.
   Wyatt Co., a consulting firm, studied 1,333 corporations
and found that the cost of defending D&amp;O suits last year
averaged $541,000, up 61% from $336,000 in 1988 and more than
three times the 1980 figure of $162,000.
   "That's the largest percentage increase we've ever shown,"
said Kenneth S. Wollner, a consultant in Wyatt's Chicago
office.
   Not surprisingly, litigation was the highest expense, with
1989 legal expenses averaging more than $818,000 per claim,
compared with an average of $514,000 spent on claims that
were settled. Even claims that were dropped cost an average
of $203,000, the annual survey reported.
   More increases are coming, the study said. It projects
that defense costs for D&amp;O claims brought in 1989 will
average $1.3 million by the time they are completed. "There's
a tremendous escalation in the cost of defending D&amp;O claims,"
said Mr. Wollner.
   He attributed the climb to increasingly complex D&amp;O suits
brought by shareholders, noting in particular a surge in the
cases that arise out of corporate mergers or reorganizations.
About 50% of the claims reported in the Wyatt survey involved
a shareholder action. Employee suits accounted for about 20%
and customer claims about 17%. Directors and officers of
companies involved in mergers, acquisitions or divestitures
are twice as likely to get sued as other executives, Wyatt
reported.
   Among the survey's other findings: recently adopted state
statutes designed to narrow the potential liability of
executives are having mixed results. They apparently are
discouraging some types of D&amp;O claims, particularly against
private companies.
   But the statutes are having little impact on suits brought
by shareholders and government agencies against executives of
public concerns.

   MAYTAG IS SUED for deceptive trade practices involving
microwave ovens.
   The Alabama attorney general filed suit in federal court
in Montgomery, Ala., alleging Maytag secretly reconditioned
defective microwave ovens at its Magic Chef Co. division
plant in Anniston, Ala., altered their serial numbers and
sold them as new.
   In Newton, Iowa, Janis Cooper, vice president of corporate
communications for Maytag Corp., said the company is
reviewing its procedures at the plant, where all Magic Chef
microwaves are made. "We take a great deal of pride in our
products and our name -- both Maytag and Magic Chef -- and we
consider the trust of our customers very important," she
said.
   The suit seeks to halt the practice, which it claims has
been going on for several years. It also asks for a recall of
all units involved and a fine of up to $2,000 for each
violation.

   FIRST WOMAN DEAN of Ivy League law school to step down.
   Barbara A. Black, dean of the Columbia University School
of Law, will leave her post at the end of the 1990-1991
academic year after 5 1/2 years. She says her term was
scheduled to end six months later but that she didn't want to
bring in a new dean in the middle of an academic year. Ms.
Black, 56 years old, supervised an overhaul of the school's
first-year curriculum and introduced new courses in legal
thought and economics and law.
   She said she plans to return to several legal history
books she is writing about 17th century Massachusetts
colonial law and to teaching at Columbia. A successor hasn't
been appointed.
