   LONDON -- Investments by United Kingdom institutions in
British ordinary shares during the fourth quarter rose to #1
billion ($1.65 billion) from a net disinvestment of #374
million in the fourth quarter, the Bank of England said.
   The figure is down from the #3.2 billion invested by
institutions in U.K. shares in the year-earlier fourth
quarter.
