   British &amp; Commonwealth PLC officials were aware of the
full extent of the financial troubles at its computer leasing
subsidiary more than a year before the London-based company
made them public, the chief executive of the subsidiary said.
   The brief statement issued Friday by Atlantic Computer
Ltd.'s David McCormick contradicts remarks by B&amp;C officials
Tuesday that they had only learned of the depths of
Atlantic's problems a few days before announcing the
write-off of the division's assets.

<TEXT>
   The write-off of B&amp;C's #550 million ($912 million)
investment in Atlantic led the company Tuesday to request
that its shares be suspended indefinitely and to the
indefinite postponement of its results for the year ended
Dec. 31.
