   MIAMI -- International Recovery Corp. expects to report
that net income more than doubled in the fourth quarter ended
March 31.
   Ralph R. Weiser, chairman, said the company estimates net
climbed to $1.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from $615,000,
or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue more than
doubled to about $50 million from $19.9 millin.

   For the fiscal year, the environmental and
aviation-services company expects to post net of about $4
million, or 87 cents a share, up 82% from $2.2 million, or 62
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $140 million
from $64.5 million.
   Mr. Weiser said the increases in per-share earnings came
on top of the company's issue of about 900,000 additional
common shares last spring.
   Two strategic acquisitions that the company made last year
have fueled the growth. To expand its aviation fueling
operations at foreign airports, the company in October
acquired certain assets of JCo Energy Partners Ltd. of
Houston for about $5.5 million. The acquisition places
International Recovery's Advance Petroleum subsidiary, which
services commercial aircraft, at 300 airports outside the
U.S.
   The company also acquired Cherokee Group Inc. of
Hollywood, Fla., to bolster its underground storage-tank
business. "It was a natural fit with our other environmental
services businesses," Mr. Weiser said. The company is also
involved in soil clean-up, and storage and disposal of used
oil and hazardous waste.
   Together, the acquisitions added about $55 million to
revenue for fiscal 1990.
   Mr. Weiser said International Recovery now plans to expand
its aviation business internally. The company diversified
into aviation fueling services, which now contribute about
50% of profits, to insulate its oil-recovery business from
the uncertainties of the oil market.
   The company is still in the market for further
acquisitions to integrate into its slower-growing
environmental business, Mr. Weiser said. "We're fortunate to
be involved in two growth businesses," he said, adding that
every major purchase of new aircraft by an airline puts more
used aircraft into the markets International Recovery serves
-- such as the fast-growing air-cargo industry.
   He said, however, that the company still has no plans to
declare a dividend, as long as it is in a "growth mode."
