   Garbagemen could soon become an endangered species.
   Waste Management Inc. said it plans to introduce this year
what it calls the nation's first fully automated
garbage-collection system in about 100 American communities.
The Oak Brook, Ill., waste-services firm said its system,
developed with Germany's waste-disposal giant Edelhoff
G.m.b.H., is more efficient than existing three-man trucks
and can be adapted for recycling without additional manpower
or equipment.

   "Waste Management has managed to cut labor costs while
improving equipment utilization. Technologically, this is a
very forward-looking system. It should give them a real leg
up in marketing," said Marc H. Sulam, environmental and
wasteservices analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Essentially, Waste Management has borrowed the concept of
containerization from the transportation industry. Without
leaving the cab, a driver can swivel his truck's
front-mounted arm lifts from side to side, thereby picking up
a garbage can that's been placed at the curb and raising it
above the cab. The trash gets dumped into the container,
where it's compacted.
   When a container is full, it can be automatically stood on
its end on the ground, and an empty container substituted.
Three fully loaded containers then can be mounted on a truck
chassis and driven directly to a landfill, thus eliminating
the need for a transfer station. Such stations are disliked
by people who live near them because they can cause air
pollution, excessive noise and road wear.
   To convert from garbage to recycling requires simply using
different containers.
   Waste Management officials acknowledge that their new
system probably won't work well in big cities because of the
difficulty in navigating a truck down city streets. Rather,
they say the system is geared for suburban and rural areas,
with one truck picking up both residential and commercial
garbage.
   Mr. Sulam said that because Waste Management worked with a
leading German company, he expects the U.S. company to pitch
its new system in Europe, too, where American disposal firms
have recently been gobbling up their European counterparts.
   Addressing a Kidder, Peabody solid-waste conference in New
York last week, Harold Gershowitz, senior vice president of
Waste Management, indicated that the company will push hard
in Eastern Europe, too. "We intend to be on the ground, ready
to go," he said, adding that he expects East European
environmental business to boom starting around 1995.
