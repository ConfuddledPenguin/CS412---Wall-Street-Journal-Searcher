   PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted industrial
production index in February fell 1.8% from January but rose
1.1% from a year earlier, the National Statistics Institute
said.
   The February drop follows a revised January advance of
1.3%, initially recorded as a 1.1% rise. The February result
was far short of Paris economists' estimates of no change or
a rise of as much as 0.5% from January.

   The index, in which the year 1980 equals 100, was 111.7 in
February, compared with 113.8 in January and 110.5 in
February 1989. It covers output in all sectors of the economy
except construction.
   Separately, the Bank of France said that its regular
monthly survey of business leaders suggests industrial
production recorded a small rise for March, and that capacity
utilization rates remained high.
