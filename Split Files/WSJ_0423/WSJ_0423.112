   NEW LONDON, Conn. -- NESB Corp. reported a first-quarter
loss vs. year-ago profit and, as a result, is in technical
default of certain loan covenants related to its 1988
acquisition of OmniBank of Connecticut Inc.
   The loss was $13.9 million, or $1.80 a share, compared
with net income of $2.5 million, or 32 cents a share, a year
earlier. The results include a $14 million provision for
potential loan losses and a $2 million provision for possible
losses related to real estate.

   The bank said the loss put it in default of covenants of a
$50 million long-term debt agreement with a group of
insurance companies. The money was used to finance the NESB's
$48 million acquisition of OmniBank. In February, OmniBank
was merged with New England Savings Banks, NESB's only
subsidiary.
   NESB said it has been negotiating with the insurance
companies about arranging waivers of the covenants, and
discussions are continuing.
   Robin Honiss, president and chief executive officer, said
the provisions reflected "escalating weakness" in the
southeastern Connecticut real estate market throughout the
first quarter. He said the bank expects further deterioration
in the real estate market in 1990 at "a more serious pace
than previously anticipated."
   The company's total assets declined to $1.35 billion as of
March 31, from $1.5 billion a year earlier.
