   Norton Co. said an unidentified bidder has expressed
interest in topping a $75-a-share, $1.64 billion offer by BTR
PLC.
   The disclosure adds a new twist to BTR's effort to gain
control of the Worcester, Mass., abrasives maker just before
Norton's annual meeting Thursday. It triggered a surge in
Norton's stock price Friday, which rose $2 a share to $77.50
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   BTR is waging a proxy fight to try to force Norton to
accept its bid, but only three of Norton's 11 directors are
up for re-election as a result of a new Massachusetts law
allowing companies in that state to create staggered boards
without shareholder approval. BTR is trying to oust those
directors as a first step toward gaining control.
   Norton said the new suitor was one of a number of third
parties that had expressed interest in acquiring a friendly
minority interest in Norton or in acquiring pieces of Norton.
Although Norton said it has held talks about such a
"white-squire" transaction, it said it hasn't held any talks
with the bidder about an acquisition because it wants to
remain independent.
   Some Wall Street sources said the late-inning disclosure
might represent an attempt by Norton to win votes at the
annual meeting or to have the meeting postponed.
   Takeover stock traders believe BTR is favored in the proxy
vote because holders of more than 62% of Norton's stock have
tendered their shares to BTR. Norton might hope that the
chance of a higher bid could undercut shareholder enthusiasm
for BTR in the contest.
   In response to the Norton announcement, a BTR spokesman
said: "Is the Norton Co. finally for sale after all the
statements to the contrary?"
   Meanwhile, BTR filed a motion in federal court in Boston
to dismiss Norton's claim that Norton shareholders who
accepted BTR's offer shouldn't be able to vote at Norton's
annual meeting.
   As previously reported, Norton argues that BTR has already
acquired the shares under a 1988 Massachusetts anti-takeover
law without complying with other provisions of that law.
   BTR, in its motion, said it "has yet to purchase {nor has
it accepted for purchase} a single share of Norton stock
pursuant to the offer. Indeed, all shares tendered in the
offer are subject to withdrawal rights under federal law
until the offer expires and the shares are accepted for
payment. Accordingly, until the offer is completed, the
tendered shares are beneficially owned exclusively by those
who have tendered them -- for purposes of {the anti-takeover
law}, federal law and otherwise."
