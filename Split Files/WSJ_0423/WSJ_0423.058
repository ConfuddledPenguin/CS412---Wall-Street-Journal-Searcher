   WASHINGTON -- El Salvador, site of one of the few
remaining guerrilla wars in this hemisphere, is also one of
the only foreign policy issues that still provokes partisan
bickering between Congress and the Bush administration.
   Since six Jesuit priests were killed last November by
right-wing death squads believed to be linked to the
Salvadoran military, pressure has been building in Congress
to cut aid to the Central American country. The White House,
fearing that could undermine the government of Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani, opposes the idea. It is
especially eager to avoid a confrontation with Congress over
the issue because that might reduce bipartisan support for
the aid it has promised to Panama and Nicaragua.

   But a showdown is coming. Some Democrats want to attach
their proposal to the same supplemental spending bill that
includes the proposed assistance for Panama and Nicaragua.
While the administration frets that Congress is dragging its
heels on that aid package, these legislators suspect
Secretary of State James Baker is stalling to keep any cut in
Salvadoran assistance off the bill.
   Their suspicions were aroused at a recent private session
with Mr. Baker. The secretary of state never goes into a
meeting unprepared. But when Rep. Gerry Studds (D., Mass.)
asked him what he thought of a proposal the Democrats sent
him two weeks earlier to withhold some U.S. aid to spur
human-rights reforms, Mr. Baker said he had been too busy
tending to pressing Soviet affairs to study the proposal.
   He did say he generally opposes cutting aid, and he
expressed hopes of forging a bipartisan approach to El
Salvador. But the lawmakers were annoyed at his refusal to
discuss specifics. "The administration is running out of
time," warns Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D., Conn.), who attended the
session. "Democrats are losing patience over this."
   Although Democrats want to use U.S. military aid as
leverage to prod the Salvador government to curb human-rights
abuses and negotiate with Marxist rebels, they don't want to
be blamed for abandoning the country's government. So their
plan would permit half the $85 million in this year's
military aid to go forward so long as the Salvador government
engages in serious negotiations. If the leftist rebels refuse
to bargain in good faith or launch another military
offensive, the balance of the aid would be released
immediately.
   The pressure to curtail aid is expected to increase. A
Democratic task force appointed last December by House
Speaker Thomas Foley is slated to issue its report within a
few weeks on the Salvador government's handling of the Jesuit
murders, as well as its human-rights record and judicial
procedures.
   According to a House aide, the report will praise efforts
by President Cristiani to investigate the crime, but will
state that he has only limited control over the military. It
also is expected to express doubts that the colonel accused
of supervising the soldiers who committed the murders -- or
any other senior officers who might be involved -- will ever
come to trial. Moreover, the report will note that
prosecution is difficult because under El Salvador's judicial
system, accused co-conspirators don't have to testify against
one another.
   "I think this will mean more pressure on Congress to put
conditions on any aid for El Salvador," predicts the House
aide.
   Mr. Baker maintains that this is the wrong time for the
U.S. to withhold aid. Negotiations between the Salvadoran
government and the rebels are set for next month, and putting
conditions on aid now might derail the process, his aides
warn. "As long as the threat of violent overthrow exists,
military aid makes sense," insists a senior U.S. official.
   But the argument that reform should take the back seat to
fighting communism doesn't carry as much weight in Congress
as it did "before the Berlin Wall fell" and communism began
to crumble, notes Robert Kurz, a Central America analyst at
the Brookings Institution and a former congressional aide.
   As a result, Mr. Baker may have to accept the Democrats'
approach to El Salvador, and over the next few weeks the
bargaining may switch from whether aid should be held back to
how much should be withheld.
