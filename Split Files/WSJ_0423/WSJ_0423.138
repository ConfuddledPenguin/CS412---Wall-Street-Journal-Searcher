   General Housewares Corp., Stamford, Conn., said it
completed the sale of one unit and accepted a management
buy-out bid for another, with combined proceeds expected to
be about $15 million.
   The Colonial Candle operations was sold to closely held
Blyth Industries Inc., based in Greenwich, Conn. Also,
General Housewares accepted a proposal from an employee
management group to acquire the Kitchen Textile Coordinates
business. Both units have been based in Hyannis, Mass.

   Kitchen Textile makes kitchen accessories, such as aprons
and place mats. It also markets canister sets and mugs. The
sale is expected to be completed around the end of June.
   General Housewares has said the proceeds would go to pay
down long-term debt, as the company concentrates on its
retail cookware business.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
General Housewares closed at $11.50 a share, down 25 cents.
