   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co.'s earnings declined for
the third straight quarter, but the company said it expects
full-year profit to exceed 1989's disappointing results.
   The company also announced it could make a decision soon
on a joint-venture cereal plant in the Soviet Union.

   Kellogg's earnings are being hampered by heavy promotional
spending efforts to regain U.S. market share. Last year,
Kellogg's share slipped to below 40% -- and earnings fell for
the first time in 37 years -- partly because competitors were
better able to cash in on oat bran's popularity.
   For the first quarter, Kellogg reported earnings of $96.3
million, or 79 cents a share, compared with $111.4 million,
or 91 cents, before an accounting change that made last
year's final net $159.5 million, or $1.30. Sales for the
latest period rose 6.6%, to $1.2 billion, from $1.13 billion.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William E. LaMothe
said the current quarter would be one of "very heavy
investment" on marketing as well as product development.
Thus, results may not match last year's earnings of $129.7
million, or $1.06 a share.
   The company decided to forgo short-term gains in favor of
long-term recovery, Mr. LaMothe said. He said he would be
pleased if Kellogg finished the year with a 40% market share;
now it's about 39.7%.
   Mr. LaMothe acknowledged that rival General Mills Inc.,
with its Cheerios line, was better able to capitalize on
oat-based cereals last year. Private-label cereals, which
sell at a discount, also hurt Kellogg, he said.
   Kellogg's psyllium-based Heartwise cereal, designed to
appeal to cholesterol-conscious consumers, is selling
"reasonably well," although the company reduced promotional
spending, pending Food and Drug Administration approval.
   The company also will seek to increase dominance overseas,
the chairman said. "The opportunity is about right" for a
plant in the Soviet Union, he said.
