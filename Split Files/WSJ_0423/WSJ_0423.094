   The Texas Public Utility Commission in a much-awaited
report concluded that a Texas Utilities Co. unit
"imprudently" spent $713 million on the long-troubled
Comanche Peak nuclear power plant.
   While the figure is sizable, it's several times smaller
than what many experts were anticipating. As a result, Texas
Utilities' stock price rose on the news, closing at $33.50,
up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Friday. More than 1,569,000 shares changed hands.

   "I am very shocked," said Edward Tirello Jr., a securities
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. "Wall
Street's expectations were somewhere between $1 billion and
$4 billion."
   Nonetheless, Texas Utilities said it considers the figure
high and will object. "Even though Wall Street estimates had
been more, $713 million is a lot of money," a company
spokesman said. "Anybody who says it's not needs a talking
to."
   The report came from an auditor, D. Nielsen-Wurster Group
Inc., Belmeade, N.J., that was hired by the state utility
commission to perform a "prudence review" of the Comanche
Peak project, run by the Texas Utilities Electric Co. unit.
The report is a preliminary opinion. A final draft is due May
25, after which public hearings will be held where Texas
Utilities said it plans to seek to have the sum reduced to
zero.
   Comanche Peak, about 75 miles southwest of Dallas, has
been dealt a series of setbacks that have pushed its costs to
about $9 billion. The project's licensing process was
suspended in early 1985, and only last week did it receive
approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Agency to operate one
unit at full power.
   The company said it expects to operate Comanche Peak Unit
1 at full power by late summer. It said Unit 2, still under
construction, is scheduled to begin full-power operations in
1993.
   The uncertainty of how much of the cost overrun would be
viewed as "imprudent" has depressed the stock price of
Dallas-based Texas Utilities. Friday's announcement of the
auditor's report, though still an early stage in the
regulatory process, removes much of the uncertainty,
according to analysts.
   Ultimately, any expense deemed "imprudent" would have to
be written down against earnings by Texas Utilities, the
company spokesman said.
   The audit covered all of Texas Utilities' expenditures on
Unit 1 and on facilities in common with Unit 2 through last
Feb. 19. It also reviewed all spending on Unit 2 through June
30, 1989.
   Meanwhile, the utility commission's staff recommended that
the company receive a 9.78%, or $422 million, increase in
annual revenue. Texas Utilities had sought a 10.2%, or $442
million, increase.
