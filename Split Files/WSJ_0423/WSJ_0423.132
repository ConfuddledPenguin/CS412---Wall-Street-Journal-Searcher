   Superpowers Lose
   Population Momentum

   THE U.S. and the Soviet Union have much in common
demographically.
   Census Bureau specialists Barbara Boyle Torrey and W. Ward
Kingkade report that in both superpower nations, the rate of
population growth is slowing, and the rate of labor force
growth is slowing even more. Writing in Science magazine,
they note that the U.S. population, which increased at an
annual rate of 1.1% in the 1970s, will grow only 0.7% a year
in the 1990s and only 0.5% annually in the first decade of
the 21st century. Over the same period, the Soviet annual
growth rate will have dropped to 0.7% from 0.9%.
   In both countries, the proportion of older people is
increasing sharply; the Soviet Union, long demographically
younger than the U.S., is now one of the world's
fastest-aging countries. The share of the U.S. population 65
and over will swell to almost 14% by 2010 from 9.8% in 1970.
Oldsters will account for 11.8% of the population in the
U.S.S.R in 2010, up from 7.9% in 1970.
   Since Americans can get Social Security as early as 62 and
Soviet women can retire at 55 and Soviet men at 60, the
pension-age population will bulk even larger. By 2010, almost
one out of six Americans and almost one out of five Soviets
will have reached retirement age.
   Naturally there are important demographic differences as
well. Life expectancy has been increasing in the U.S. but
dropped in the Soviet Union during the 1970s. And while the
fertility rate in both countries has remained relatively
stable in recent years -- around 1.8 or 1.9 children per
woman in the U.S. and around 2.3 or 2.4 in the Soviet Union
-- the disparity among ethnic groups is far greater among the
Soviets. In 1988, the U.S. fertility rate ranged from 1.7 for
white women to 2.7 for Hispanics. But the Soviet Union's
central Asian nationalities had fertility rates double those
of the country's European and Caucasian ethnic groups.
                                                                                                       

   Part-Time Work Is Fine,
   If It's What You Want
                                                                                                       

   ARE PART-TIME jobs good ones or bad ones? It all depends,
says a new analysis.
   Part-time employment has grown slowly over most of the
post-war period; more than 15% of all adults in non-farm
civilian jobs work less than 35 hours a week. About
one-fourth of all working women and not quite 9% of all
employed men are part-timers. Most work part-time
voluntarily, but one out of four female part-timers and
better than two out of five male part-timers do so because
they can't get full-time work.
   Part-time jobs are usually thought of as bad jobs, with
low wages and few fringe benefits. But in a contribution to a
Brookings Institution volume titled "A Future of Lousy Jobs?"
Northwestern University economist Rebecca Blank discovers
that although part-time hourly wages do average less than
full-time wages, the difference isn't all that great -- not
quite 8% less for women and 6% for men. She also finds
particular types of work -- many professional and managerial
jobs, for example -- where part-timers get even slightly
better hourly wages than full-timers with similar
qualifications.
   There are marked differences, however, in fringe benefits.
Ms. Blank reports that part-timers are only one-third to
one-half as likely as full-timers to have all-important
health insurance or pension-plan coverage.
   The overall conclusion: Because most part-timers work
fewer hours voluntarily, they presumably have personal
reasons that offset the negatives, and thus for them,
part-time work isn't too bad a deal. For part-timers who
can't find full-time jobs or single heads of families
prevented from working full-time because of child-care
responsibilities, a part-time job is indeed a bad one.
                                                                                                       

   Nursing Homes Factor
   Into More Futures
                                                                                                       

   NURSING-HOME stays loom large for future oldsters.
   Christopher Murtaugh and colleagues at the federal
government's Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
figure that more than half the women and almost one-third of
the men turning 65 this year will spend time in a nursing
home before they die. Assuming average risks for each spouse,
seven out of 10 couples now reaching 65 can expect at least
one partner to use a nursing home sometime before dying.
   The researchers base their estimates on a study of a large
sample of individuals dying between mid-1982 and mid-1984.
More than one-third had been in nursing homes at some point
after reaching 65. Not surprisingly, the older the dying
person, the greater the likelihood of a nursing home stay,
due partly to the longer life but also the increasing
probability of chronic illness as the person aged.
   "Because individuals now turning 65 have a longer
life-expectancy than the persons studied, they face a still
higher remaining lifetime risk of nursing home use," the
researchers explain. In the sample studied, women were almost
twice as likely as men to have been in a nursing home, and
whites far more likely than blacks.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SEATTLE IS the best city in North America for bicycling,
the editors of Bicycling magazine conclude, based on readers'
nominations. Two California cities -- Palo Alto and San Diego
-- are next best, while New York City, Orlando and Pittsburgh
are the cyclists' top horror spots. . . . An increasing
number of men and women in their 30s and 40s are entering
social work, making a career change for altruistic reasons,
according to Richard Edwards, a dean at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.
