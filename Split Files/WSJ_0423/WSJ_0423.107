   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Amgen Inc. said that a
joint-venture partner received commercial approval from the
Japanese government to market a gene-spliced drug developed
by Amgen for the treatment of anemia related to kidney
disease.
   Kirin Brewery Co. will market the drug, erythropoietin,
under the trade name Espo in Japan. Amgen obtained Food and
Drug Administration approval last June and sells the drug in
the U.S. under the trade name Epogen.

   Under terms of their 1984 agreement, Amgen and Kirin split
profits from their venture on a 50-50 basis, Amgen said. Espo
was approved for sale at about double the U.S. price of $10
per 1,000 units. About 80,000 Japanese suffer from anemia due
to kidney failure, Amgen said.
   Epogen costs the average U.S. patient $5,700 to $6,000 a
year, Amgen said. But the company cautioned against doubling
this amount to estimate costs for Japanese patients, who may
require lower doses of the drug because of generally lower
body weight.
