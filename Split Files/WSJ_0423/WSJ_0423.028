   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it will launch a new
information service, DowVision, that will deliver business
news and information through corporate computer systems
directly to desktops.
   The information package will include news from the Dow
Jones News Service (the "Broadtape"), Professional Investor
Report, Capital Markets Report, Dow Jones International News
Services and Federal Filings. Additional information will
come from PR Newswire and Business Wire, which carry
corporate news releases.

   DowVision is a product of Information Services, an
operating group of Dow Jones, which is publisher of The Wall
Street Journal.
   Software companies, so-called alliance developers, have
developed software at the user end that will receive the
material and manage it to customers' specifications. The
software will select the data the customers have specified
they want.
   The companies that will make up the alliance developers
include: American RealTime Services Inc., New York; Desktop
Data Inc., Waltham, Mass.; GESCAN International Inc.,
Research Triangle Park, N.C.; and Verity Inc., Mountain View,
Calif.
   In the future, DowVision will provide customers with
access to News/Retrieval's archive of business and financial
data bases -- but without the need to dial into the system
using a modem. DowVision's flat-fee pricing will eliminate
per-minute charges on all Dow Jones-proprietary information,
reducing a significant barrier to usage.
   Dow Jones also publishes Barron's magazine and other
magazines, community newspapers, and provides financial
market information through its Telerate Inc. subsidiary.
