   ISLAMORADA, Fla. -- The Bush administration is moving to
curtail an array of planned investment and trade assistance
to the Soviet Union in the wake of Moscow's efforts to crush
the Lithuanian independence drive.
   Although the administration hasn't specified what steps it
is prepared to take, officials traveling with President Bush
here over the weekend said the likely course will be to
backtrack on an extensive list of trade and economic
concessions urgently sought by Moscow to repair the faltering
Soviet economy.

   For the U.S., such minimal punitive measures could help
assuage mounting pressure, especially from U.S.
conservatives, for a harder line against Moscow, while
preserving the momentum toward arms-control agreements
important to both sides. The administration is eager to stay
on track with wide-ranging arms-control talks scheduled for
May, as well as to sign a conventional-forces reduction
agreement later in the year.
   Mr. Bush had proposed several trade measures in his
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last December,
including extensive technical assistance and an end to
certain legal restrictions on U.S.-Soviet trade, in an effort
to help the Soviet leader calm domestic discontent and show
concrete results from his aggressive moves on arms control.
   While increased trade with the Soviets would have little
initial impact on the U.S. economy, officials said the
measures are eagerly sought by Moscow after five years of
economic restructuring has failed to improve the average
Soviet's standard of living.
   The administration signaled its decision Friday after days
of noncommittal reaction to Moscow's campaign of intimidation
against the Baltic republic, a campaign that included the
cutting off of oil and gas supplies last week, the takeover
of a printing plant and reports of a halt of some food
supplies.
   After initially saying the White House would have no
comment on Lithuania, administration spokeman Marlin
Fitzwater issued a statement at midday Friday saying the
president is "increasingly concerned by news reports of an
economic crackdown" in the republic. "Although our
information is sketchy, we are disturbed that this signals
another unfortunate step in the pressure being brought to
bear on Lithuania by the Soviet Union."
   Mr. Fitzwater said the president has stepped up
consultations with the allies and expects to conclude them
early this week, when he will advise Congress of his
intentions. An administration spokesman said later that the
administration began sending cables to the allies as early as
Wednesday.
   Mr. Fitzwater also said that Mr. Bush wasn't planning to
coordinate a multilateral response to the crackdown, but was
merely advising the allies of his intentions. And he was
careful to reiterate that the U.S. wasn't planning to take
any military action in the region.
   Among the likely courses of action would be to withhold
U.S. support for observer status for the Soviet Union at the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the West's primary
trade-regulatory body. Mr. Bush could also withhold
cooperation on a broad agreement to liberalize trade, which
both sides had hoped to sign by the time the two leaders meet
for an arms-control summit May 30.
