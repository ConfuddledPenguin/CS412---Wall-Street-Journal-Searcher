   Two of the Japanese trading company C. Itoh &amp; Co.'s
chemical subsidiaries, C. Itoh Fine Chemical Co. and C. Itoh
InterChem Inc., both based in Tokyo, plan to merge businesses
on July 1.
   The new company, tentatively to take the C. Itoh Fine
Chemical name, will be capitalized at 300 million yen ($1.9
million) with 110 employees. Total sales are forecast at 100
billion yen for the initial year, and two trillion yen within
five years.

   One of the joint company's principal businesses will
involve efforts to develop resins for industrial use and the
raw materials used in making them, thus helping to build its
market share in the chemical industry.
   By combining both units' resources, the parent company,
one of Japan's Big Three general trading companies and a
member of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank group, hopes to strengthen
its presence in an increasingly competitive international
market, the company said.
