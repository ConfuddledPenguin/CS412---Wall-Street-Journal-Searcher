   NEW YORK -- Bairnco Corp. shareholders have filed a number
of lawsuits, charging the company with violating securities
laws in connection with its announcement that its insurance
coverage against asbestos-related litigation may be in doubt.
   In January, New York-based Bairnco said it planned to spin
off its Keene Corp., New York, subsidiary to stockholders.
Earlier this month, Bairnco affirmed that plan, but it
disclosed in its annual report that almost all of the $143
million of insurance coverage available to Keene at March 31
"is subject to litigation or dispute."

   The lawsuits, seeking status as class actions, have been
filed in the past couple of weeks in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. They name as defendants Bairnco and various
officers and directors and request damages. Bairnco declined
to comment on the litigation.
   The company's asbestos litigation stems from
Baldwin-Ehret-Hill, a company that Keene, a manufacturer of
heat-shielding devices, owned from 1968 to 1974. From 1968 to
1972, some of BEH's thermal insulation and acoustic products
contained asbestos.
   In one suit, shareholder William Steiner charges that in
its 1987 and 1988 financial statements, the company painted a
rosy picture of its outlook. The 1988 annual report
"reinforced the portrait of Bairnco as a successful, growing
company" with its "problems behind it," the suit says.
   The suit then charges that Bairnco failed to properly
disclose the financial impact of an October 1988 accident at
a production plant; the 1988 slowing of sales within its
shielding segment; and "the most devastating" problem: the
extent of its potential asbestos liability.
   Bairnco's actions "artificially" inflated and maintained
the company's stock price "to create the impression that the
company was healthy and continuing its growth. . . ." the
suit charges.
   Bairnco, which makes laminates and adhesives, shielding
systems, and cutting products, has said it expects to win the
fight for its asbestos-insurance coverage, but its stock
price has taken a hit. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Friday, Bairnco shares closed unchanged at $6.75.
