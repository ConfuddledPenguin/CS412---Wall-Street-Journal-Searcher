   McDonnell Douglas Corp., whose earnings a year ago were
artificially inflated by a one-time accounting adjustment,
posted a 98% drop in first-quarter net income, while
operating results rose meagerly and barely broke even.
   The biggest disappointment came at the aerospace company's
Long Beach, Calif., transport-aircraft unit, which registered
an $84 million loss for the period -- more than twice as wide
as the deficit of a year earlier. The company largely blamed
the poor performance on the fact that a lot of money is being
ponied up to develop and flight-test the MD-11 commercial
tri-jet, but revenue won't begin to be registered until the
plane is certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and
deliveries can get under way.

   But the problems in Long Beach run deeper than any one
project. In February 1989, the 45,000-plus employees at the
site undertook an extensive reorganization aimed at improving
efficiency and cutting costs. The first-quarter loss means
there is all the more pressure for the bottom line to display
improvement in the second half. It also underscores that
while McDonnell Douglas has the promise to make more money
than any other aerospace company, except for Boeing Co., it
has yet to realize that potential.
   The reshuffling in Long Beach is, in many eyes, a flop. In
the first quarter, the MD-80 aircraft line fell into the red
after two periods of steady gains. The company attributed the
slip to having to train and integrate new workers,
difficulties that were especially acute in the assembly of
MD-80 noses. Some industry experts also say that at least
some of the 25 MD-80s delivered by McDonnell Douglas during
the first quarter were sold at a huge discount to carriers,
especially Delta Air Lines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,
in an attempt to hang on to market share.
   "There's no way you can sugar-coat what happened," said
Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.'s Howard Rubel, who is considered one
of Wall Street's more upbeat analysts when it comes to
McDonnell Douglas. "The results are lower than they should
be.
   "But it shouldn't come as a shock that Douglas is still
suffering operationally," he added. "What it really does is
put the spotlight on the second part of the year."
   James Phillips, deputy general manager of the MD-80
program, maintained that the line is already positioned to
rebound. He said the section of the factory manufacturing the
plane's noses experienced congestion during the first
quarter, but it is now being equipped to handle extra
capacity. "We've added more people and more tools," he said.
"We expect the situation to be well corrected within the next
several months."
   Overall, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas posted net of
$2 million, or five cents a share, compared with $169
million, or $4.43 a share. Last year's figure includes a $179
million gain from the initial application of a new accounting
standard for taxes. Revenue, which jumped in every business
segment, increased 19% to $3.83 billion from $3.22 billion.
   The units that manufacture military products at McDonnell
Douglas, the nation's No. 1 defense contractor, turned in
mixed showings. The missiles, space and electronic systems
units collectively earned $13 million, down 68% from $41
million a year before. But the company's jet-fighter
operations, which had minor production problems during the
first three months of 1989 on the AV-8B Harrier aircraft and
in other areas, recorded a more than tripling of profits to
$104 million from $32 million. Improved margins on the F-15
Eagle and F/A-18 Hornet lines and lower costs on the Air
Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter helped in particular.
