   EXCHANGE RATE FEARS

   In a telephone survey carried out during a lengthy
television interview with West German central bank President
Karl Otto Poehl, a startling 86% of respondents opposed a
one-to-one exchange rate for East German marks into West
German marks.
   The East German government has demanded parity between the
two currencies because of fears by its citizens that their
purchasing power will plummet if their country unites with
West Germany and accepts a lower exchange rate. But West
Germans are concerned that the one-to-one rate would
destabilize their currency and lead to rapid inflation.
   More than 202,000 responses were recorded in last week's
survey by the television station ZDF, smashing a previous
record of 86,000. The station warned that the survey was a
random sampling that shouldn't be considered representative.
   But a central bank spokesman said that "the fact that such
a huge number of people responded gives the result a more
representative quality."
                                                                                                       

   MEXICAN NEWSPRINT
                                                                                                       

   The Mexican government lifted its control over newsprint,
a monopoly often criticized as an obstacle to press freedom.
In announcing the move at a gathering of newspaper editors
and publishers, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said
newsprint could now be freely imported, though a 15% tariff
would be levied. In past years, there were frequent
allegations that the government withheld newsprint supplies
to opposition newspapers and periodicals.
                                                                                                       

   JOBLESS POLES

   Unemployment in Poland reached nearly a third of a million
in mid-April, or about 2.4% of the work force, the Labor
Ministry said. Many state companies are slashing their labor
forces in order to survive as the government cuts subsidies
and attempts to inject competition into the stagnant economy.
                                                                                                       

   FREEZING OUT LITHUANIA
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Union has asked a Japanese consortium to change
its plans to build a refrigerator compressor plant in
Lithuania and instead locate it elsewhere in the Soviet
Union. The request was reported by Sanyo Electric Co., a
member of the consortium, which also includes trading concern
Nissho Iwai and Toyo Engineering Corp. Moscow is currently
applying economic sanctions against Lithuania to force it to
withdraw its declaration of independence from the Soviet
Union. Officials of the Japanese consortium say they haven't
decided whether to accept the Soviet request.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH AFRICAN DIPLOMACY
                                                                                                       

   South Africa opened a permanent mission in Budapest in a
move that could herald full diplomatic ties with Hungary. The
mission, short of a formal embassy, gives South Africa its
first diplomatic foothold in Eastern Europe. Hungary's state
news agency MTI said Budapest would open a similar office in
Pretoria within a month.
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE GROWTH
                                                                                                       

   Despite the recent decline in the yen as well as in stock
and bond prices, the Japanese economy will expand at a still
respectable, inflation-adjusted 4.3% pace in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1991, predicts a leading think tank. The
Wako Research Institute of Economics said strong personal
consumption and corporate investment in plant and equipment
will compensate for weaknesses elsewhere in the economy.
                                                                                                       

   BRAZILIAN COUCH BOOM
                                                                                                       

   President Fernando Collor de Mello's drastic economic plan
has Brazilian psychiatrists laboring overtime to give solace
to the nation's wealthy.
   "I've been working 14 hours a day since the plan was
announced. The rich feel a mixture of panic, astonishment,
anger and depression, and they want to talk about it," said
Flavio Gikovate, director of the Institute of Psychotherapy.
Other psychiatrists in Sao Paulo and Rio, the largest cities,
report sharp increases in the number of patients, most of
them affluent.
   Mr. Collor's plan, in effect since March 16, set an
18-month freeze on savings accounts of more than $1,200;
limited withdrawals from money market funds to $600, or 20%
of an account, whichever is greater; and froze about $115
billion -- 80% of all bank deposits.
   Most of Brazil's poor majority weren't directly hit
because few had savings. And with inflation drastically
reduced during the past month, many of the worst-off say
their salaries buy more.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   After months of protests against his government, Gabon's
President Omar Bongo agreed to end single-party rule and
permit democracy in the West African country. Opposition
parties will be allowed to form immediately to contest
legislative elections this year. . . . Beginning in June,
residents everywhere in the U.S. will be able to listen
round-the-clock to Japanese-language radio service. Most of
the programs will be from Radio 1 of NHK, the Japan
Broadcasting Corp., via a communications satellite.
