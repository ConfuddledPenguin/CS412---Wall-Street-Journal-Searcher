   NEW YORK -- A biography of Greta Garbo that's been locked
in a vault for more than a decade will be published in June
by Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.
   Written by Antoni Gronowicz, a Polish-born poet and
novelist, "Garbo" is said to contain many details about the
actress's childhood and personal life, including accounts of
love affairs with both men and women. A spokesman for Simon &amp;
Schuster said that the book is based on conversations over
many years between Ms. Garbo and Mr. Gronowicz, a
decades-long friend of the actress.

   The author sold the book in 1976, said his agent Morton
Janklow, getting an advance of "several hundred thousand
dollars." The price might have been higher, said Mr. Janklow,
but the author had demanded, out of respect for his
privacy-obsessed friend, that the book remain unpublished
until her death. Mr. Gronowicz died in 1985, but his wife and
son, who are living in New England, will receive the
royalties from what seems likely to be a best seller.
