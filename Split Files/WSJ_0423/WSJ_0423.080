   ROCHESTER N.Y. -- John P. White, head of Eastman Kodak
Co.'s newest and most ambitious business venture, isn't
easily daunted.
   Take the time he was giving a speech on electronic imaging
at a recent computer trade show in New York. A power outage
suddenly left the room pitch-black, but Mr. White continued
speaking, interjecting humorous anecdotes where slides were
supposed to be shown.

   That unflappable style, picked up during his days as a
Marine lieutenant, should help him as he faces one of his
most challenging tasks: turning Kodak's disjointed and poorly
performing electronic imaging business into a moneymaker. Mr.
White was brought in as vice president, integration systems,
late last year to integrate Kodak's computerbased products,
such as scanners and printers, which were marketed separately
by individual units.
   If Mr. White is successful, the payoff could be enormous.
By 2000, the electronic imaging industry is expected to
generate as much as $20 billion in annual sales. Moreover,
the company's revenue from the imaging market is expected to
surpass Kodak's traditional business in photographic film and
paper.
   The new marketing thrust is already paying off. Last
month, Kodak signed an agreement to provide International
Business Machines Corp. with imaging application software for
IBM's PS-2 computer system. Industry observers termed the
agreement a breakthrough for Kodak's electronic imaging
business.
   Unlike chemical imaging -- such as photographic film and
paper, which are based mostly on silver-halide technology --
electronic imaging uses electronic technology to store,
retrieve and send images; it will be used in a number of
fields, from medicine to education and office management.
   For the affable, 52-year-old Mr. White, a history buff who
seems more comfortable in jogging sweats than a business
suit, the task of opening new markets for an emerging field
comes after a long stint in government.
   As an assistant secretary of defense during the Carter
administration, Mr. White managed policies of the new
all-volunteer army, playing a key role transforming the
military from a draft system to a volunteer force. Also under
President Carter, he served in the Office of Management and
Budget as deputy director responsible for the Defense, State,
Treasury and Labor departments' budgets. Mr. White was
eventually awarded the Distinguished Public Service medal, an
annual award given by the president.
   He joined Kodak in 1988 after it acquired a Santa Monica,
Calif., computer firm he headed, Interactive Systems. "The
stakes are big in electronic imaging and that's another
challenge," he adds.
   To illustrate the emerging technology, Mr. White likes to
describe a future hospital in which a New York patient's
medical history, X-rays and charts are stored in a computer
electronically. They can be called up instantly on a display
screen and then transmitted to a Los Angeles hospital over
the telephone. "It's the next information revolution," Mr.
White asserts.
   But putting together an electronic system won't be an easy
task in tradition-bound Kodak, where departments and experts
in different areas were isolated from each other. "This
requires a lot more cooperation among business units than
they're used to," says Mr. White.
   Moreover, Mr. White is one of the few outsiders among
veteran Kodak executives. "It would have been harder if I
came in saying I understand photography," Mr. White says.
"But I came here with a computer industry view which Kodak
doesn't have much in the way of."
   Until now, "we've never had a central organization to
integrate these products," says Lawrence J. Matteson, general
manager of Kodak's imaging information systems. Jacques
Kauffmann, president of Imaging Management &amp; Consulting Inc.,
puts it more bluntly: "They were going all over the place."
   Although the photographic giant has developed some
innovative products in electronic imaging, such as a device
for digitizing microfilm and the world's biggest capacity
optical disk, it hasn't been able to put together a complete
system.
   That has contributed to the financial woes of the segment,
which has yet to show a profit. Kodak, noting that electronic
imaging is a "business opportunity for the 1990s and beyond,"
admits to letting individual units become too independent.
Counters Jack Ennis, who follows Kodak technology for Arthur
D. Little Co., "From a sales viewpoint, it's much more
attractive to market packages."
   Mr. White says Kodak, like other computer companies, is
learning that "the future is going to require a lot of
integration."
   The biggest hurdle in his new job will be explaining
electronic imaging to the average person, he believes.
"People don't quite know what it is," he says. "The exciting
aspect of it is the possibilities."
