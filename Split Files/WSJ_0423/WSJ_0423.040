   NEW YORK -- Borden Inc.'s first-quarter profit rose 6.9%
on 4.1% sales growth, with strong results in grocery and
specialty products more than offsetting lower profit in
snacks and international products.
   Also, Borden directors declared a 10.4% dividend increase
to 26.5 cents a share, payable June 1 to stock of record May
11.

   For the quarter, Borden reported net income of $63.1
million, or 43 cents a share, up from the year-earlier $59
million, or 40 cents a share. Sales climbed to $1.89 billion
from $1.82 billion.
   In the grocery and specialty products division, operating
profit improved 38%, led by the North American pasta
operations and such niche grocery products as Borden,
Lite-Line and Fisher cheeses, Cremora non-dairy creamer and
food-service products.
   Operating profit for snacks and international consumer
products fell 18% on an 11% sales increase to $454 million.
The company said profit was better in the European sweet,
baked snacks group, and in the Wise Foods and Humpty Dumpty
North American salty snack units.
   The dairy division posted a 12% drop in profit on a 7.2%
decline in sales to $490 million. The sales decline reflected
the absence of results from the company's former butter
business, which was shed in December. Borden said it expects
improved profit in the dairy division, citing declining costs
for milk.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Borden closed at $31.875 a share, unchanged.
