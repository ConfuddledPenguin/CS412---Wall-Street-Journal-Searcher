   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Ailing Tektronix Inc. said its
president and chief executive officer, David P. Friedley,
resigned.
   Robert Lundeen, chairman, will serve as interim chief
executive officer, and William Walker, a director, will serve
as interim president, until a permanent successor to Mr.
Friedley can be named, the company said.

   Tektronix didn't elaborate on Mr. Friedley's departure.
The maker of electronic measurement instruments has seen
earnings flag during the past four years owing to slow growth
and poor acceptance of new products.
   For its third fiscal quarter ended March 3, Tektronix
reported a net loss of $25.5 million, or 88 cents a share, on
revenue of $421.9 million. It had a profit of $6.4 million,
or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $434.1 million the year
earlier.
   The company has eliminated as many as 1,400 positions
since the beginning of the current fiscal year. Mr. Friedley,
who became president and chief executive in 1987, recently
said that he had hoped product introductions would provide
the company with renewed earnings growth but conceded that
results have continued to be disappointing. He said the
company's woes stemmed in part from a downturn in the defense
industry, a major Tektronix customer.
   On Friday, Tektronix shares closed at $13.375, up 50 cents
a share, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
