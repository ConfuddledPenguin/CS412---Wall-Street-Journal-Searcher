   WASHINGTON -- White House Budget Director Richard Darman,
sounding more optimistic about the political climate than he
has for some time, said it is "highly likely" that
deficit-reduction talks with Congress will begin within a
month.
   The Bush administration hasn't yet initiated negotiations
because "the mood wasn't right" and talks would have been
counterproductive, Mr. Darman told reporters. "The mood is
moving," he said. "It's moving slowly, but it's getting
there."

   The sticking points in any talks are likely to be how much
to cut the defense budget beyond what President Bush has
proposed, how to restrain growth in entitlement programs such
as Medicare, and what taxes to raise.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
said he favors a prompt start to negotiations only if all
sides display willingness to work toward a significant
package. "There's concern that a lot of hope could be raised,
but that talks only lead to another slide-by budget," he
said. He said the president's continued public opposition to
tax increases is an obstacle.
   Even before talks begin, the White House appears to be
losing control over the size and shape of cuts in defense
spending. Without a revised, long-term blueprint from the
Pentagon, lawmakers already are drafting plans for the most
fundamental changes in military spending in more than two
generations.
   Not only does the House Budget Committee seek to slash
Pentagon spending authority $24 billion below the
administration's fiscal 1991 request, but the Chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), is
now leading the fight to postpone or cut substantially some
of the military's most prized high-tech programs, including
the MX nuclear-tipped missile and the Trident submarine.
   In a long-awaited speech, Sen. Nunn, usually a strong ally
of the military, said he wants to keep actual Pentagon
outlays in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, at $297 billion,
only $1.5 billion higher than the House committee proposed
and $6 billion below the Bush budget.
   Mr. Darman insists that congressional appropriations
committees are unlikely to agree to such deep cuts, and he
predicted that many House members will object once they
realize how their own districts would be affected.
   Over five years, Sen. Nunn seeks to cut as much as $255
billion in budget authority from the Pentagon's wish list. He
envisions withdrawing nearly all front-line Army troops from
Western Europe by 1996 and eliminating most of the service's
heavy-tank forces; retiring hundreds of older helicopters and
surveillance planes; and mothballing dozens of ships and
reducing the Navy's traditional presence in every hemisphere.
   In sharp contrast to Pentagon plans to exempt most
training and maintenance accounts from deep cuts, Sen. Nunn
said the services could save billions by scaling back
training maneuvers and relying more heavily on simulators to
train aircraft and tank crews.
   Sen. Nunn, intent on increasing competition between the
services for funds, said the Navy could save $15 billion over
the next five years by modestly trimming the amount of time
its ships are at sea. More than twice that much could be
saved by slower replacement of U.S. long-range nuclear
forces, the Georgia lawmaker said, and cutting the
administration's ambitious plans to expand spending to deploy
a space-based antimissile system. He didn't specifically
detail the production cuts he intends to propose for the Air
Force's controversial B-2 Stealth bomber.
   Meeting with reporters Friday, Mr. Darman reiterated
warnings that the current economic slowdown is increasing the
amount of deficit reduction that must be achieved to avoid
across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   He now figures negotiators will need to find at least $45
billion -- about $8.5 billion more than the administration
originally calculated -- in lower spending or higher revenue
to meet the Gramm-Rudman target of $64 billion. If the
economy returns only gradually to the path that the
administration forecast in January, an additional $12 billion
in deficit reduction may be needed, he said. The precise
figure will be set by the revised economic forecast the
administration is to issue in July.
   Mr. Darman dismissed the budget plan approved last week by
the House Budget Committee as one that doesn't even meet the
standards set by Chairman Panetta. "It's a slide-by budget of
just the type that he has criticized and lamented," Mr.
Darman said.
   Rep. Panetta said all sides are now staking out bargaining
positions. Despite controversy over the defense budget
recommended by his committee, he expects the full House to
approve the panel's plan this week.
