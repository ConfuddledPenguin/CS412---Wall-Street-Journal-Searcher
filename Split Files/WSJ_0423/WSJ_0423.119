   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court's ruling that states may
outlaw the possession of child pornography in the home may
have broad consequences for the privacy of adults.
   The logic of the court's opinion last week, written by
Justice Byron White, has alarmed some legal experts. "This is
a whole new theory of censorship, never before applied by the
Supreme Court," says Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard
Law School.

   The 6-3 ruling upheld an Ohio law that makes it illegal to
possess nude photographs of children, even if they are used
privately in the home. A ban on private possession is
justified, the court said, because owning such material helps
perpetuate commercial demand for it and hence the
exploitation of the children who are involved.
   The possible effects of the opinion don't stop with
pornography. Under the court's logic, government could
intrude into the home any time a seemingly private activity
is thought to perpetuate a commercial market for actions that
exploit others. Justice William Brennan's dissenting opinion
suggested one such example: A state might make it illegal to
own or use products that were made by a company that violated
child labor laws.
   At the very least, the high court's 6-3 decision last week
suggests that the day may be approaching when the court will
uphold government bans on private possession of adult
pornography, as well as child pornography.
   To do that, the justices would have to overrule an
important 1969 decision, Stanley vs. Georgia, which said the
First Amendment protects possession of adult, obscene
material at home.
   Some legal experts say the court is poised to do just
that. "I predict that within three years, the court will say
we don't have any reason to distinguish between child
pornography and adult pornography," Mr. Dershowitz says.
"Clearly, they've cut back on Stanley vs. Georgia, and at
some point they may well overrule it," says Harvey Zuckman,
director of Catholic University's Institute for
Communications Law Studies.
   The decision may lead to new restrictions on adult
pornography, these experts argue, because there is an
increasingly widespread belief that adult pornography
exploits the women who are depicted. If the court accepts
that view, it may conclude that possession of adult
pornography perpetuates a market that exploits women. "The
theory is fully applicable to adult pornography," says
Georgetown University Law School Professor Michael Seidman.
   Of course, legal experts don't all agree on the impact of
the ruling. "It is not my view that this changes criminal law
doctrine in the field at all," says William Van Alstyne, a
Duke University Law School professor. He said the decision
upholding the Ohio law, which is similar to laws in 18 other
states, "was a foregone conclusion" from a 1982 ruling
upholding state laws that make it illegal to sell material
showing sexual performances by minors. The state laws were
based on the premise that children who are the subject of
pornography are more susceptible to lasting harm than adults.
   Last week's ruling also may have the effect of more firmly
entrenching a 1986 decision upholding a state law that made
private, homosexual activity between consenting adults
illegal. Although Justice White didn't directly address state
sodomy laws, his approach to the privacy of the home makes it
unlikely that the court will look more favorably in the near
future on homosexual conduct.
