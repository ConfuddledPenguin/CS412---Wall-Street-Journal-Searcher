   MUNICH -- Like many other West German manufacturers,
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG suddenly finds itself confronted
with its past.
   BMW's original car-making factory in the East German town
of Eisenach was taken over after World War II and turned into
a Soviet-style company making frumpy Wartburg cars.
Meanwhile, in West Germany, BMW turned its Munich aircraft
engine plant into a factory producing some of the most prized
and expensive cars in the world.

   After the Berlin Wall opened, the East Germans invited BMW
engineers to tour the Eisenach plant, hoping the West Germans
would be willing to take it back and spruce it up.
   The answer: a firm but polite nein, danke. BMW is likely
to say the same to the Czechs, who are looking for a Western
partner for their car maker, Skoda.
   Eberhard von Kuenheim, the longtime BMW chairman, said the
Eisenach plant doesn't come close to meeting West German
environmental standards; it employs four times as many people
as would a comparable BMW plant; and "the plant looks like a
picture of one of our plants in 1928, with no renovation
since."
   As for Skoda, he said, "I think it would be easy to
convince Skoda that BMW would be a good partner for them. But
up to now we aren't so convinced that Skoda is a good partner
for us. Besides the money you'd have to spend to take 50% or
whatever, you would have to bring a lot of money with you to
reshape factories and the product line." Skoda's main
attraction, the only real sales and dealership network in
Eastern Europe, probably isn't enough to persuade BMW to
invest.
   Instead, Mr. von Kuenheim said BMW will soon start pouring
money into relatively small start-up plants that make tools
and components, employing 200 to 300 people at a time in East
Germany, and then perhaps elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Mr. von Kuenheim said the main attraction of this approach
is its speed. "Big investments by big companies take a long
time, maybe three to five years, but these people need help
now," he said. "It's much easier and quicker to help these
people who suffered for 40 years by starting thousands of
small-business activities."
   This approach also offers maximum control, a vital feature
for a firm known for hands-on management style and exacting
technical requirements. Mr. von Kuenheim said BMW is leaning
toward starting its own small companies in the East, rather
than taking over existing ones. Then it can hire its own work
force and not have to prune a bloated payroll. And he doesn't
expect problems finding qualified, motivated East German
workers.
   Mr. von Kuenheim's strategy differs sharply from that of
his main West German counterparts, including Volkswagen AG
and Daimler-Benz AG, which have scrambled to take over East
German car and truck plants.
   But then, BMW's top executive has never felt compelled to
follow the pack. Mr. von Kuenheim took over the chairmanship
of BMW in 1970 at the age of 41. Many analysts said BMW
"matured" along with its chairman, achieving a record level
of production and profits, but they also accuse BMW of often
taking an overly cautious approach. During the 1980s, for
example, while many other car companies rushed to diversify
beyond their traditional production areas, BMW dragged its
feet.
   Now, with many auto companies finding it difficult to
integrate these diverse activities, Mr. von Kuenheim doesn't
try to hide the fact that he feels vindicated. "I prefer my
little problems instead of the bigger problems of other
people," he said.
   He takes the same confident view toward the new
opportunities in the East. Despite BMW's unwillingness to
jump into the region brandishing its checkbook, Mr. von
Kuenheim is confident that Eastern Europe will develop more
quickly than expected into a flourishing free market.
   Mr. von Kuenheim already has plenty of reason to be happy.
BMW last year sold a record 523,000 cars, up from 490,000 the
year before. Driven by the success of the redesigned series
500 and 700 cars, BMW group earnings jumped 21% in 1988 to
455 million marks ($271 million). Group figures for 1989 will
be released next month, when analysts say they expect another
"good improvement."
   More important than the numbers, however, is BMW's steady
advance on archrival Daimler-Benz. BMW now competes head to
head with Daimler in the top-of-the-line luxury classes. And
in April, BMW overtook Daimler for the first time in an
annual ranking of West German companies by Manager Magazin,
becoming the top-ranked company in the survey.
   Mr. von Kuenheim believes he can turn events in the East
to the company's longterm advantage. With the number of
vehicles per capita in Eastern Europe only one-fifth that of
the West, "this is a huge potential demand," he said.
   At first, perhaps, this demand will be more for Fiats and
Volkswagens. But Mr. von Kuenheim is patient and optimistic.
As entrepreneurs get rich in the East, he believes they'll
sooner or later turn up at a BMW dealer. "The quicker
everybody's income level moves up, the sooner they will
become our customers," he said. Eastern Europe will, however,
probably remain a parts supplier rather than a big market for
luxury cars for some years to come.
   But Mr. von Kuenheim already has a toehold. He said BMW
sells about 1,500 cars a year in Hungary, and it recently
made a small but symbolic sale in Czechoslovakia: President
Vaclav Havel's entourage now has three big BMWs in the Czech
national colors, red, white and blue.
