   Chuck DeCaro has developed a rare bird: a flying news
room.
   To some, it could be a dramatic breakthrough in
journalism. Stocked with satellite transmitters, radar,
telescopic cameras and an arsenal of high-tech studio
production equipment, the Lockheed L188C Electra can fly a
news team any time, anywhere and land on a short dirt runway.
It can produce and transmit fully edited television news
reports from the sky, allowing a network to scoop the
competition.

   Mr. DeCaro sees himself as the inventor of "the most
important news tool since the plume pen." Skeptics see him as
a quirky adventurer who stubbornly continues to push an
overpriced, impractical idea.
   "I don't know if he's Quixote or the next Ted Turner; I
just don't know," says Stephen Jacobs, senior producer for
CBS's special events unit.
   Whatever the case, Mr. DeCaro, 40 years old, is in the
tantalizing, perilous situation of many entrepreneurs
starting high-risk ventures. He has risked his life's savings
on his idea, but has yet to bring in the first penny from the
venture. And yet, the networks and other potential clients
have given him just enough encouragement to keep him
struggling at it.
   Concedes CBS's Mr. Jacobs: "We're giving it
consideration."
   In addition, big companies -- including Motorola Inc.,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s Panasonic Co. and Shell
Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group -- have donated or
lent more than $1 million worth of equipment to his cause,
often in exchange for stakes in the venture. Mr. DeCaro, in
turn, touts the interest as proof of others' confidence in
his idea.
   Mr. DeCaro has many cynics intrigued, if not amused. He
cultivates the aura of a soldier of fortune, brags of being
caught as a reporter in guerrilla mortar fire in Nicaragua
and eats an occasional dish of rattlesnake.
   His idea for Aerobureau Corp. was born during his headier
days as special assignment reporter at Cable News Network.
After a rather tortuous trip to Grenada in 1983 that
subjected him to gunfire, exorbitantly priced fishing-boat
rides and plenty of lost time, Mr. DeCaro decided there was a
better way to get the news.
   So he went about inventing a flying news room, which he
says would be perfect for breaking news stories such as the
Achille Lauro hijacking in the Mediterranean or the wreck of
U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland's plane in Ethiopia's mountains.
   For instance, in a disaster such as the Mexico City
earthquake, an Aerobureau crew would scramble from a hangar
in Tucson, Ariz. In only four hours, it could send live
camera feeds via satellite of the wreckage below in Mexico
City, Mr. DeCaro says.
   Three two-man news crews carrying cameras could be
deployed, with a collapsible helicopter stored onboard, as
well as an all-terrain vehicle. Live remote reports could be
shot from the ground in the sixth hour, with overhead shots
and commentary from a pilot-reporter in the plane.
   Besides beating the competition, the system would bypass
logistical problems of traditional reporting, such as finding
transportation and arranging for local satellite transmitters
during disaster situations.
   One might think such a stunning display of deadline flair
would certainly drive ratings-hungry news networks to a deal.
But there are some very big hurdles Mr. DeCaro must jump
before he can fly.
   For starters, Mr. DeCaro is asking $6.5 million for a
year-long exclusive contract. Yet all networks are suffering
budget cutbacks and corporate pressure on profits.
   "We don't have a lot of money to throw around, and we want
to make sure every penny is spent wisely," says Jay Fine, NBC
managing director of news production and technical services.
He echoes complaints of every other network Mr. DeCaro
approached -- ABC, CBS, CNN and Fox.
   "They're looking at price, not value," says Mr. DeCaro,
who says the plane could augment other regular news programs.
   Then there is the issue of reporters. Mr. DeCaro insists
his hand-picked, 10-person crew can deliver flawless news
reports, but networks oppose having anyone but their own
people reporting the news.
   Mr. DeCaro argues that his insurance won't cover any
passengers, the flight team would have to wait for a news
anchor and the plane, called the Amazin' Lady, would simply
be a "star vehicle."
   Mr. Jacobs has another concern: "I have trouble seeing how
his tool would be useful more than twice a year," he says.
   For all their objections, Mr. Jacobs and others concede
they're still considering the idea. And Mr. DeCaro remains
militantly resolute: "No matter how much they tell me no, it
will be yes. It has to work."
   The plane itself, leased from a Canadian airline, is
loaded with equipment for covering a crisis. An obsessive
techie, Mr. DeCaro rattles off acronyms of his beloved
equipment: SLAR, FLIR, SLOS (read: Side Looking Airborne
Radar, which gives a high-definition video map of 100 miles
on each side of the plane; Forward Looking Infrared, which
allows video during total darkness; and Stabilized Low-light
Optronic Systems, a stabilized telescopic camera with an
image intensifier.
   Even the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, not to mention some insurance
firms, are looking at the plane's capabilities to see if it
could also be used to assess damage in a disaster area.
   Mr. DeCaro, who got his pilot's license before his
driver's license, was always fascinated by flying and the
military. He entered the Air Force Academy in Colorado in
1969, but says he left two years later because he didn't make
the grades. "It was the heartbreak of my life," he recalls.
   As a special assignment reporter for CNN for four years,
he flew an F-14 into an inverted spin to illustrate a Navy
program to halt the loss of jets and pilots during
uncontrolled flight. He also camped in jungles in enemy
territory in Nicaragua to interview contra Commander Zero,
Eden Pastora. He has written for the "Army Times" and has
recounted more than one story in Gung-Ho, "the magazine for
the international military man."
   In 1986, the year before he left CNN, he sold everything
he owned for $150,000 to get his project off the ground.
Since then, free-lance journalism assignments and borrowed
money from family and friends kept him afloat. Last year,
Aerobureau was paid $25,000 in a contract to videotape a
trans-Atlantic balloon voyage, but the trip was scrubbed for
safety reasons.
   Today, Mr. DeCaro lives a spartan life in a shared house
in the woods near Great Falls, Va. "He's a cross between a
journalist and a soldier of fortune. He doesn't fit the
mold," says Ted Kavanau, Mr. DeCaro's former boss at CNN.
"But a lot of sober people have their high-tech stuff on the
plane."
   Indeed, Motorola supplied the plane's side-looking
airborne radar antennae. Panasonic lent nearly $250,000 worth
of editing devices, color cameras, video recorders and other
gear.
   Mr. DeCaro even wrangled the gas to fly the plane out of
Shell Oil Co., one of the largest suppliers of aviation fuel
in the country -- about 20,000 gallons valued at about 60
cents a gallon, or about $12,000.
   "He's doing this on less than a shoestring -- it's a
thread, says Ken Spalding, manager of aviation sales of Shell
Oil. "But everybody's sitting on the wing hoping like hell
it'll make it."
