   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration removed its leading
proponent of a strong federal role in commercial research,
signaling the end of its internal debate over industrial
policy.
   Craig Fields, the head of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, was told Friday by the Pentagon that he
would be fired if he didn't resign or accept a demotion.

   The action immediately provoked strong criticism from
Congress, where Mr. Fields's agency, commonly known as Darpa,
has enjoyed strong support in recent years. Robert Costello,
a former senior Pentagon official under President Reagan,
predicted a major row between the administration and Capitol
Hill. "It will be like a shootout in the OK Corral," he said.
   Mr. Fields's ouster is already causing friction within the
administration, particularly at the Commerce Department,
which has strongly backed the former Darpa chief and has
argued unsuccessfully for a greater government role in
ensuring the U.S. stays abreast of leading technologies. A
Commerce Department official criticized the move and said,
"he's getting canned because he was doing the right thing."
   The immediate cause of Mr. Fields's removal, congressional
staff members and Pentagon officials said, was Darpa's
decision earlier this month to invest $4 million in a small,
closely held company, Gazelle Microcircuits Inc., Santa
Clara, Calif. The officials said that Deputy Defense
Secretary Donald Atwood took offense at the investment,
claiming that it represented the type of intervention in the
economy that the Bush administration shuns. Mr. Atwood
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Underlying that dispute is a long-running debate within
the administration over how the government ought to invest
billions of dollars in research funds. Proponents of a strong
federal role say the money should go into areas that will
help commercial industry. Opponents say that if a technology
holds commercial potential, then it should be attractive to
industry without government intervention.
   In that debate, Darpa has been the odd man out in the
Reagan and Bush administrations. The Pentagon research
agency's $1 billion budget doesn't even rate a separate line
in the federal budget, but it has a big say in U.S.
technological development. It picks technologies it thinks
will be winners, and invests millions in the firms pioneering
those fields. While the investments are supposed to be
defense-oriented, even Darpa's supporters say the defense
rationale behind the agency's decisions sometimes is
strained.
   Mr. Fields has rankled the White House and some Pentagon
officials by leading the government in promoting a federal
role in the development of high-definition television,
advanced semiconductor manufacturing and a host of other
technologies with potentially big commercial payoffs.
   "There's an ideological battle going on that says it's OK
to drop $8 billion in a superconducting supercollider -- the
epitome of basic research," said Rep. Don Ritter (R., Pa.), a
former Lehigh University engineering professor who is a
member of the House Committee on Science, Space and
Technology. "But you can't touch anything that has to do with
American industrial competitiveness, because that's
considered industrial policy."
   According to Pentagon officials and congressional aides,
an official reporting to the Defense Department's Mr. Atwood
delivered an ultimatum to Mr. Fields Friday: resign, accept a
new job studying the Pentagon's laboratories, or be fired
soon for "insubordination." The Atwood aide then handed a
paper describing the new job to a stunned Mr. Fields. When
Mr. Fields asked if his deputy, Victor Reis, could replace
him, he was told "no", the officials said.
   Mr. Fields declined to comment. Colleagues said he spent
the weekend considering his situation, and is expected to
resign or take the new job briefly to wait and see if the
Pentagon changes its mind.
   Mr. Fields's removal could devastate Darpa, which, like a
high-tech company, must keep its specialized personnel in
order to explore emerging technologies. Two of the agency's
60 managers told friends over the weekend that they plan to
resign, and more departures are expected. "This has crushed a
lot of us," said one military technologist.
   For its part, the Pentagon put out a statement denying
that Mr. Fields is "being fired." Instead, it said it plans
to transfer him to the position of deputy director of defense
research and engineering, with responsibility for helping
streamline the Pentagon's labs. The Pentagon said Friday he
has 15 days to report to his new job.
   Mr. Fields's many admirers in Congress and industry say
they will press the Pentagon to reconsider. George Keyworth,
formerly President Reagan's science adviser, said he has been
calling officials within the Bush administration to push for
a reversal. Sen. Albert Gore, the Tennesee Democrat who
chairs the Senate science subcommittee, praised Mr. Fields as
a "farsighted, strategic" thinker, and castigated his
opponents as "narrow, shortsighted and driven by ideology."
   By all accounts, Mr. Fields is very independent. He has
pushed Darpa into a host of new fields, including super-fast
computers, lightweight satellites, and small rockets. The
43-year-old computer scientist took over as director last
year after working at the agency for 15 years. A driven man
who routinely works 80-hour weeks, he is married to a
language specialist at the Central Intelligence Agency. He
has been a master at balancing the sometimes opposing
interests of the administration and Congress. In the current
fiscal year, Congress approved 12% more for Darpa than the
administration requested, while cutting the total Defense
Department budget by 1%.
   But Mr. Fields appears to have pushed the administration
too far with the investment in Gazelle. That investment
represented the first time the agency had made use of a new
venture capital fund approved for Darpa last year by Congress
at the behest of Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam
Nunn (D., Ga.). Under the terms of the deal, Darpa won't take
a stake in Gazelle, which is designing computer chips out of
gallium arsenide, but it may collect royalty and cash
payments.
   Congressional staffers said that Darpa had worked with Mr.
Nunn's staff to write the legislation setting up the fund,
even though the idea hadn't been approved by the White
House's Office of Management and Budget. Then, Mr. Fields
awarded the contract without informing his superiors. "It was
like raising a red flag before a bull," a congressional
staffer said.
