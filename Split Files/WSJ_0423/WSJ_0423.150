   The Internal Revenue Service has some Nebraska charities
over a barrel, all because of a seemingly innocuous item
called a pickle card.
   Pickle cards are an old fund-raising device, indigenous to
the Middle West. An instant lottery-ticket with pull tabs,
the pickle card is so named because in the old days they were
often sold from empty pickle jars. For a dollar or so, a
player gets a card, pulls the tabs, and, if the symbols
underneath match, wins. Under Nebraska law, nonprofit groups
are the only ones that are allowed to sell pickle cards.

   For years, the revenues from the cards were regarded as
tax-exempt under federal law. Then came the Tax Reform Act of
1986. A single sentence in the act placed a federal tax on
profits from such devices as unrelated business income. But
many Nebraska nonprofit groups missed the four-year-old
change -- until a letter from the IRS pointed it out to them
this year.
   Now, a number of the 200 or so organizations that are
subject to the federal tax, including Catholic schools,
Little League teams, even the University of Nebraska football
team's booster club, are in a panic. About a dozen of them
are looking at potential six-figure bills for back taxes,
estimates Carl Patterson, an IRS official in Omaha.
   "It would wipe us out. We would be done. We would have to
sell off all our assets to repay it," says Ed Lehotak of
Gladiators Athletic Association Inc. in Omaha, a 20-year-old
athletics organization for boys and girls. "We don't like the
business {of selling pickle cards}, but it's the only way we
can consistently raise money year-round."
   Faced with this crisis, the organizations have turned to
Congress for help. The state's two senators, James Exon and
Bob Kerrey, and Rep. Peter Hoagland of Omaha have introduced
legislation that would retroactively repeal the tax.
   "The federal government has cut many social programs and
increased the need for private charitable resources," Sen.
Exon said in introducing the bill. "This is not the time to
send an IRS deficiency notice to the orphanage and the
church."
   No one seems to know what will happen if the legislation
doesn't pass. "You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip," says
Mr. Patterson, the Omaha IRS man. "If the money isn't there,
it isn't there."
