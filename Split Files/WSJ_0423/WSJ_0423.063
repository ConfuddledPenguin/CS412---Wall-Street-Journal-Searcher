   The Supreme Court decision that a federal judge can order
tax increases is probably the most important decision that
will be issued this term. As a matter of constitutional law,
the result is simply too preposterous to survive long as a
precedent for other cases. The decision should be viewed,
rather, as another byway in the court's and the nation's
tortured but valiant struggle with the issue of race.
   Missouri v. Jenkins is not likely to mean we have a new
rule of law that unelected federal judges may order tax
levies by local officials to pay for judicially preferred
social programs -- housing, welfare, environmentalism, higher
salaries for judges. Americans long ago gave a lesson in
Boston Harbor about what we think about taxation without
representation. Most federal judges will understand that
accepting an invitation to order tax increases risks the
nobility of the law and ultimately the independence of the
judiciary. In any event, with Chief Justice Rehnquist and the
three young Reagan Justices joining in an outraged dissent,
any Bush Justice is likely to be the swing vote back on the
next test case.

   What, then, to make of this opinion? As Justice Anthony
Kennedy noted in the dissent (excerpts nearby), this case
cannot be understood outside its facts. Federal District
Court Judge Russell Clark has spent a decade deciding how to
integrate the public schools in Kansas City, Missouri. The
frustrations of this kind of litigation invite blinkered,
prime-directive reasoning. Here, the directive was to create
racial balance in the schools, regardless of cost.
   When white flight left too few whites to make integration
possible, Judge Clark decided he had to lure whites back with
a magnet-school program. He demanded an estimated $500
million to $700 million to make the schools the best-endowed
public schools in the country. The voters disagreed,
repeatedly voting down taxes to fund the enticement of white
students with natatoriums, model U.N.s, aesthetically
pleasing carpets and 15 computers per classroom. Voters
dumped tea bags on Judge Clark's courthouse steps.
   The Missouri Constitution required a two-thirds vote to
raise property taxes, but over the half-dozen tax-levy
propositions, voters never went beyond a bare majority. The
local school board, which wanted the huge new budget, didn't
have the power to get around this limitation. So in 1987,
Judge Clark simply ordered that the local property tax be
doubled. By a 9-0 vote, the Justices agreed that he went too
far by directly ordering this tax.
   But by a 5-4 vote, they said Judge Clark could order the
tax indirectly by "authorizing and directing" -- that is,
ordering -- local officials to raise the tax, despite the
state Constitution saying they don't have the power. In any
case, if it was unconstitutional for Judge Clark to levy the
tax in the open, how can it be constitutional to do the same
thing behind a mask?
   In the final section of his dissent, Justice Kennedy
disclosed the most important single fact about the majority
opinion. He said it can be understood only as a special case
because the subject matter is race. "The historical record of
voluntary compliance with the decree of Brown v. Board of
Education is not a proud chapter in our constitutional
history," he wrote. "The judges of the district courts and
courts of appeals have been courageous and skillful in
implementing its mandate." But "while few ends are more
important than enforcing the guarantee of equal educational
opportunity," he wrote, good ends cannot justify
unconstitutional means.
   This nation can by and large be proud of its efforts to
deal with the racial issue; we can count considerable if
incomplete progress in an area where most societies have
failed or feared to tread. The courts have played an
especially important role; with other political institutions
unable to move, the judicial activism of Brown v. Board of
Education surely had a moral justification. But it
nonetheless carried a legal risk, inviting judges to try to
remove every blot on the body politic.
   Even on the issue of race, public sentiments have changed,
and the legislative and executive branches pass and enforce
civil-rights laws. It has become increasingly evident that
judicial fiat, not given to dealing with social complexities,
is not going to solve the remaining problems. This is
ironically illustrated in the Kansas City schools under Judge
Clark's jurisdiction.
   Black parents in Kansas City have sued because their
children have been denied admission to the local magnet
school. They were excluded because they would have upset the
court-ordered racial statistics. In other words, black
parents have decided that the best hope for their children is
quality education, not the company of white children. Yet
they are told they cannot attend the school of their choice
because they have black skins.
   If this is where we have arrived, surely it is time for
judges to back off from their activism. Certainly they should
not be rushing in to claim, of all things, the power of
taxation. Kings did not ultimately succeed in taxing
Americans without their consent, and neither will judges.
