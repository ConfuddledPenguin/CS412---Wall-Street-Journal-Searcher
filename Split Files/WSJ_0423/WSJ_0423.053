   PEORIA, Ill. -- Caterpillar Inc. said first-quarter net
income fell 30% to $99 million, or 97 cents a share, from
$141 million, or $1.39 a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 9% to $2.87 billion from $2.63 billion.

   The maker of heavy equipment said the decline in profit
reflected higher costs because of wage and benefit increases
for payrolls, including higher costs for health care, product
development, factory modernization and other company
programs. The company also cited higher material costs and
depreciation expenses. The effects of the weaker U.S dollar
also had an unfavorable effect on costs in Europe, the
company said.
   Caterpillar said its first-quarter sales were "somewhat
stronger than anticipated." The company attributed the
increase in sales to higher prices but only slightly higher
volume.
   Sales outside of the U.S. rose 12%, reflecting higher
machines sales in developing countries, particularly the
Pacific Rim region. The company also said demand rose in a
number of Latin American countries. In the U.S., Caterpillar
said machine demand was strong in petroleum and coal-mining
applications, but declined in the construction and forest
products, metals and nonmetals mining industries.
   The company said U.S. sales of engines were "well-below"
year-earlier because of continued weakness in demand from
truck makers.
