   CHICAGO -- First Chicago Corp.'s first-quarter profit, as
expected, fell sharply, mostly because of an increase in
troubled real estate loans, and the company denied that it
improperly told analysts about the problems before broadly
disclosing the information.
   The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago, with
$49.99 billion in assets, said net income for the quarter
tumbled 45% to $68.6 million, or 93 cents a share, from
$124.7 million, or $1.85 a share, a year earlier. Both
periods include a small amount of tax benefits.

   Meanwhile, Barry F. Sullivan, chairman and chief executive
officer, denied in a meeting with reporters before the
company's annual meeting that First Chicago had informed Wall
Street analysts about its looming first-quarter problems
before publicly disclosing the information. "Our people
categorically deny it," Mr. Sullivan said.
   Analysts on Wall Street have said they were told during
the middle of March about prospects for a first-quarter
profit decline. Increased real estate problems and
lower-than-expected trading and venture capital gains were
the reasons analysts have said they were given. Analysts'
profit estimates were trimmed, and First Chicago's stock came
under heavy selling pressure during that period.
   Friday, First Chicago shares dropped 50 cents to close at
$30.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. On March
29, First Chicago publicly disclosed that its profit for the
period would be cut by about half, citing those reasons. This
forecast was more specific than anything the analysts said
they were given.
   Since then, two lawsuits have been filed on behalf of
First Chicago shareholders, accusing management of failing to
promptly and fully disclose the problems. Mr. Sullivan
asserted Friday that the suits are without merit.
   Some analysts were contacted by staff members of the
Securities and Exchange Commission after the stock decline
and news accounts of the briefing of analysts by First
Chicago. James J. McDermott Jr., head of stock research at
Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. in New York, said he got such a
call from an SEC staff member in Chicago asking about his
discussion with First Chicago -- "a series of what looked
like form questions."
   Mr. McDermott said a First Chicago official volunteered to
him in mid-March that an increase in problem real estate
loans was coming, and further that "a big credit was going to
go on" nonperforming status, and that it was in Southern
California.
   Mr. McDermott said he was told by someone outside the bank
that the loan was on Los Angeles-area projects of VMS Realty
Partners, a troubled real estate concern. A bank official
confirmed the name for him, he said, and when he asked
whether it was $150 million or $250 million, "they
sympathized with the higher amount."
   Other analysts had similarly specific information.
   Mr. Sullivan said First Chicago hasn't heard from the SEC
on the matter. He wouldn't comment on VMS. Responding to a
question on the briefing of analysts, he added: "All your
observations are incorrect."
   Anita Nagler, associate regional director in the SEC's
Chicago office, wouldn't comment.
   The first-quarter figures would have been worse but for a
$52 million pretax gain from the partial settlement of a bank
unit's pension obligations.
   The first-quarter results included a $160 million
provision for loan losses, more than double the
fourth-quarter's $75 million provision. First Chicago charged
off $374 million of loans in the quarter, mostly loans to
lesser-developed countries on which reserves had been set up
in previous periods.
   Nonperforming loans rose 10% to $1.05 billion. The real
estate portion of that is $375 million, up from $172 million
at year end. Also, First Chicago has $217 million of real
estate assets it has repossessed or otherwise taken ownership
of.
   Mr. Sullivan said he expects the loss provision to return
to more normal levels in the remaining quarters of 1990,
calling the first period "an interruption."
