   LONDON -- Giddy from surging trading volume in oil futures
over the past few months, London's International Petroleum
Exchange is moving toward introducing a Middle Eastern crude
oil futures contract.
   Draft specifications circulating among traders contain
details of a 1,000-barrel Dubai crude contract that could
begin trading this summer, dealers say.

   It is a logical step following soaring volumes of North
Sea Brent oil futures and options, says Christopher Bellew,
head of the energy division at C. Czarnikow Ltd., London
commodity merchants.
   However, the market for Dubai crude is relatively small,
he points out. Dubai crude is produced at a rate of 350,000
barrels a day, Mr. Bellew says, which is equivalent to a
monthly tally of 19 cargoes, each containing half a million
barrels of oil. By comparison, the North Sea fields can
supply 40 cargoes a month.
   Dubai petroleum is similar to Iranian and other "sour," or
high-sulfide, crude oil that is produced in the Middle East,
Mr. Bellew says, so the contract should be popular.
   "OPEC won't be able to ignore the contract; it will be a
visible price for a key, Middle Eastern crude oil," says
Peter Gignoux, director of Shearson Lehman Hutton's
international energy department. He hopes that more Middle
Eastern producers will deal in London.
   Spot Dubai oil traded at $13.80 a barrel Friday, against
$17.90 for the "sweet," low-sulfide Brent oil and $17.95 for
West Texas Intermediate.
   The proposed new contract would make its debut following a
year in which volumes exceeded the most optimistic
expectations of the International Petroleum Exchange,
officials say. With prices volatile, Brent oil futures
averaged around 14,000 contracts a day this month, says Peter
Wildblood, chief executive of the exchange.
   This is double the daily average of last year and more
than three times the levels in 1988, the year in which the
contract was resuscitated, he says. Each Brent crude contract
is for 1,000 barrels, or about 42,000 gallons.
   Trading in heating oil has also soared, Mr. Wildblood
says, but a heavy fuel contract, which opened trade last
year, is disappointing; the exchange is looking for ways to
attract interest. Besides the Dubai contract, the exchange is
considering introducing a naptha or gasoline contract.
   Such has been the growth of the International Petroleum
Exchange that it is taking a growing share of the
international oil trade. Last year, for example, volumes in
Brent futures were only 8% of the dealings in West Texas
Intermediate on the much larger New York Mercantile Exchange.
In the past few weeks, the proportion has risen to around 14%
of New York's daily average of 100,000 contracts a day.
   Meanwhile, dealings in London's heating oil contract rose
to an average of around 8,500 contracts a day from 6,000 in
1988, the exchange says. Although it is a slightly smaller
instrument than its U.S. counterpart, its volumes are now a
third of the levels on the New York exchange, up from 25%
three years ago.
   Trading surged since the London exchange abandoned a
lunchtime break and extended trading hours until 8 p.m., Mr.
Wildblood says. Some dealers still complain about the longer
hours, he says, but most exchange members appreciate that
almost 40% of the London trade occurs from late afternoon
onward when the New York market is active.
   Increasing numbers of U.S. traders are making use of the
London market, Mr. Wildblood says, but better volumes are
also benefiting the New York Exchange. Such "Wall Street
refiners" as J. Aron &amp; Co., a division of Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., Phibro Energy, a unit of Salomon Inc., and Morgan
Stanley Group account for a high proportion of London trade,
dealers say.
   As a result of buoyant conditions, prices of seats on the
International Petroleum Exchange have jumped to around
$260,000 from $80,000 two years ago. There are now 42
"locals," or trading-floor speculators, at the exchange, Mr.
Wildblood says, although producers, refiners, professional
traders and distributors still account for 70% to 80% of
dealings.
   The Brent contract is attracting more European players
because it is an international benchmark crude, says Laurent
Chatenay, futures trading manager at ICI Chemical &amp; Polymers
Ltd. He says his firm is reducing dealings in U.S. oil
futures, which are more suitable for North Americans.
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Livestock and Meats
                                                                                                       

   Prices of cattle futures contracts might come under
downward pressure at the open of trading today in the wake of
a government report showing that the flow of young cattle
onto feedlots in March didn't slow as much as expected.
   After the close of trading Friday, the Agriculture
Department said that the number of young cattle placed onto
feedlots in seven major ranching states in March fell 4% from
March 1989. Livestock analysts had expected the department to
report a 10% drop. Feedlots fatten livestock for slaughter.
   The department reported that the number of cattle on
feedlots in the seven states rose 3% instead of the 2% rise
that had been expected.
   The department also released a quarterly survey of
feedlots in 13 states. The report was generally in line with
expectations, showing that the number of cattle on feedlots
on April 1 rose 1% from the same date in 1989.
   In the report, the department projected that sales by
feedlots in the 13 states to slaughterhouses could rise 1%
from the same 1989 quarter. The projection signals that the
slaughter could hit a record for any second quarter.
                                                                                                       

   Copper
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices fell sharply Friday, dropping 4.05 cents a
pound to $1.1255. Further declines are expected even though
new fundamental developments are lacking.
   Traders apparently viewed the return of striking workers
at one Peruvian mine as a sign that the separate six-week-old
miners' and smelter workers' strike in that country may soon
end. Statistics indicating the U.S. economy is more sluggish
than at the beginning of the year also are worrying traders,
analysts said.
   Traders will be keenly watching today's London Metal
Exchange's report on copper stocks. Estimates range for
increases of anywhere from 5,000 tons to as much as 12,000.
   Despite all this, Fred Demler, metals economist for
PaineWebber in New York, noted the Peruvian strike still
hasn't been settled and a major Chilean mine that recently
had a production disruption still is working at only 60% of
its capacity. Production losses may amount to as much as
25,000 tons of refined copper, as a result, he said. Chile is
the world's top copper producer.
   In the futures market, Mr. Demler noted, the price drop
hasn't been as severe as it might seem. "After all, the price
rose from below 95 cents in January to $1.25 in early April.
It's only given up about 10 cents or so of that in what has
to be regarded as a fair correction."
   Copper supplies are still tight and dealer prices in the
U.S., Japan and Europe remain high, he noted. Also,
soonest-to-expire months in London and New York futures
markets are higher priced than more deferred ones, he noted.
"If supplies were really more ample, the premiums in the cash
market would be sharply lower. In the futures markets, the
premiums would have disappeared," he said.
                                                                                                       

   Coffee
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices rose Friday but the prospect of increased
Brazilian shipments of coffee limited the advance and may
continue to weigh on the market.
   A major factor contributing to the price advance was the
rapid absorption of 1,054 notices to deliver coffee against
May contracts, analysts said. Friday was the first day for
the issuance of such notices.
   The quick acceptance of such a large number of notices by
dealers generated the perception that demand for immediately
available supplies of coffee remains very strong and futures
prices rose, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton, New York.
   However, Ms. Kaul noted, prices later partially fell back
and the general impression was that, with Brazilian exports
of coffee having resumed, supplies that have been backlogged
in that country will soon be finding their way on to the
world market.
