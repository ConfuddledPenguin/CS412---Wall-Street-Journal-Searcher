   Toronto's Reichmann family proposed, through its various
holdings, a complex reshuffling of energy assets that would
create Canada's biggest domestically owned oil producer, and
establish Canada's main oil pipeline as a separate public
company.
   The proposed transactions, announced by Reichmann-owned
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., 89.3%-owned GW Utilities
Ltd., and 74.3%-owned Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., would
result in the merger of Gulf Canada and Home Oil Co.,
creating a company with oil output of about 132,000 barrels a
day, and assets of five billion Canadian dollars (US$4.3
billion).

   Home Oil is a wholly owned unit of Calgary, Alberta-based
Interhome Energy Inc. The Reichmanns are in the process of
effectively gaining control of Interhome Energy.
   Interhome's other main asset, 100%-owned Interprovincial
Pipe Line Ltd., would form a separate public company under
the proposals. Interprovincial, with assets of about C$1.5
billion, owns a 2,300-mile oil pipeline extending from
Alberta to the U.S. Midwest and eastern Canada.
   Terms of the proposed transactions, which the Reichmanns
plan to present over the next few weeks to the boards of Gulf
Canada and Interhome, weren't disclosed.
   Pending shareholder and other approvals, a spokesman for
Olympia &amp; York said it hopes a merger of Gulf Canada and Home
Oil could be completed this summer, with the proposed spinoff
of Interprovincial to Interhome's shareholders to follow late
this year.
   The first step of the complicated corporate realignment
involves an agreement, also announced Friday by Gulf Canada,
that would effectively cement control of Interhome in the
Reichmanns' hands.
   Under its terms, Gulf Canada said it agreed, subject to
regulatory approval, to acquire Imperial Oil Ltd.'s 22.8%
interest in Interhome for C$54.50 a share, or a total of
C$492.4 million. Gulf Canada said it plans subsequently to
resell the Interhome stake for C$250 million to GW Utilities,
thereby increasing GW Utilities' stake in Interhome to 63.5%
from the current 40.7%.
   Toronto-based GW Utilities is itself expected to be taken
public later this year by the Reichmanns, who offered through
Olympia &amp; York in January to acquire the company's remaining,
minority-held shares.
   Imperial Oil, 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., said it plans to
use proceeds from the sale of its Interhome stake to help
reduce debt, which swelled with its recent C$4.96 billion
purchase of Texaco Canada Inc. Imperial Oil plans to shrink
debt to about C$2.5 billion by the end of 1991 from C$3.82
billion at Dec. 31, a spokesman said, partly through the sale
of some C$1.5 billion of assets. Imperial Oil doesn't see
Interhome as a "core" holding, he said.
   The planned sale of the Interhome stake is expected to
generate a net gain to Imperial Oil of about C$195 million,
or C$1.03 a share, the company said.
   Gulf Canada said it will fund the initial purchase of
Imperial Oil's Interhome stake by drawing on existing bank
credit lines. It said it will also immediately pursue asset
sales totaling as much as C$300 million, using proceeds to
cut debt from the Interhome purchase.
   Gulf Canada, which on April 12 had most of its debt
downgraded by Moody's Investors Service Inc., said the asset
sales will mainly involve nonproducing properties, including
its stake in Alberta's big Caroline gas field. It is also
expected to announce soon a buyer for its Asamera Minerals
Inc. unit, which owns 51% of a gold mine in Washington state.
   As reported, Moody's attributed its downgrade to what it
described as Gulf Canada's "weak" earnings outlook, its
dwindling production from low-cost conventional oil fields,
its heavy capital costs linked to frontier developments in
Canada's Beaufort Sea and elsewhere, and its hefty dividend
requirements.
   The criticisms echoed those of at least some analysts, who
for months have ruminated about a possible marriage of Gulf
Canada and Home Oil, whose steady oil output and C$188.3
million 1989 cash flow was generated mainly from low-cost
conventional fields in western Canada. Interhome, with its
ill-fitting oil, gas and pipeline legs, was also regarded as
an odd hybrid.
   "This is a good move for everybody," said Denis Mote, an
analyst with Toronto's Maison Placements Inc. "It's basically
a rationalization of Olympia &amp; York's oil and gas assets. And
if Gulf sells assets" as planned to fund its Interhome
purchase, he said, "they may not end up with any more debt
than they started with."
   Moody's confirmed its ratings on Gulf Canada Friday,
saying it would monitor, among other things, the amount of
debt the company ultimately absorbs from Interhome. Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp., meanwhile, placed about C$1.2 billion of Gulf
Canada and Interhome debt on credit watch surveillance, with
negative implications.
   As part of their proposed transaction, Gulf Canada and GW
Utilities said they would grant one another rights of first
refusal on any sale of their interests in Interhome. The
companies also said Interhome's 15-member board, which along
with Gulf Canada's will consider the Reichmanns' proposals,
will include eight inside nominees, and seven outsiders.
   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday, Toronto-based GW
Utilities closed at C$34 a share, up 25 Canadian cents;
Interhome closed unchanged, at C$47.50; Imperial Oil's Class
A shares closed at C$56.875, unchanged; and Gulf Canada's
shares fell 12.5 Canadian cents, to C$13.50.
