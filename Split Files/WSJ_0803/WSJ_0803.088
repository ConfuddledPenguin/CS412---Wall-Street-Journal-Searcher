   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said there have been politically motivated
attempts to influence the agency's decisions regarding
regulation of financial institutions.
   The FDIC chief, William Seidman, in testimony before the
Senate Banking Committee, said there have been "maybe two or
three instances where it would appear that people were trying
to push us to a decision" regarding "particular
transactions."

   In answer to a question by Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.),
Mr. Seidman said he had been subject to such pressure, but
that it had been "a very minor factor." He didn't explain
what form the pressure took, how he responded, or what
decisions or financial institutions were involved. Neither
Mr. Bryan nor any of his colleagues pressed the bank and
thrift regulator to elaborate on his response.
   The issue of political influence of thrift regulation has
been raised in recent weeks by the case of Arizona
businessman James Fail, who purchased 15 insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls
from the government in 1988. An investigation by a Senate
Judiciary subcommittee has revealed that Mr. Fail, who had a
number of previous legal problems, made the purchase under
extremely favorable financial terms after a former adviser to
then-Vice President George Bush lobbied regulators on his
behalf.
   In yesterday's hearing, Mr. Seidman admitted that in a
separate government sale to Mr. Fail of an Oklahoma bank,
federal regulators "didn't have all the information on him we
should have had."
   Mr. Seidman said the FDIC and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation were jointly reviewing Mr. Fail's purchases in
Texas for possible civil fraud and criminal violations. Mr.
Fail has previously denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Seidman
reiterated that the FDIC is reviewing a large number of
government sales of failed thrifts in the Southwest in 1988
and would consider trying to undo transactions found to have
been tainted by fraud. The regulator conceded that there were
opportunities for speculative and fraudulent profits in the
government's heavily subsidized sales of insolvent S&amp;Ls. "We
live in terror of what is going on out there," he said.
