   MIAMI -- A federal judge ruled that Eastern Airlines
couldn't give preferential treatment to pilot trainees over
returning strikers in filling permanent cockpit jobs.
   The narrow ruling, by U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis
of Miami, affects only about 180 replacement pilots who
hadn't yet flown paying passengers, not all 800 or so hired
to fly Eastern through an eight-month-long strike.

   An attorney for the Air Line Pilots Association, James
Linsey, said damages and back pay for the displaced union
pilots could total $100 million. Eastern, however, said it
would appeal, and didn't anticipate any immediate effect on
the airline or its pilots.
   At issue was the method Eastern used to fill its cockpits
after the pilots union struck Eastern in sympathy with
machinists in March 1989. Some striking pilots asked to
return to work last August, after Eastern had filled many
positions. Eastern then began keeping two lists, filling job
openings from its roster of newly hired pilots over those
pilots who crossed the picket line. After the strike ended,
Eastern continued to fill openings from its list of
replacement pilots, including those who were in its training
program at the time.
   Eastern had filed suit last August against the pilots
union to have the company's hiring of replacement workers
declared legal. But Judge Davis ruled that replacement pilots
flying regular, revenue-generating flights before the union
pilots offered to return can be accorded permanent status;
that status can't be extended to the trainees, he said.
