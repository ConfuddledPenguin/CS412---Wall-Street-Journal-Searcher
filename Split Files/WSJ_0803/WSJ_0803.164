   ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. -- Charles R. Shoemate, president
of CPC International Inc. was elected to the added post of
chief executive officer, succeeding James R. Eiszner, who
will continue as chairman of the board.
   Mr. Eiszner, who is 62 years old and has been undergoing
cancer treatment, said the change is part of the food
products company's "succession plan and is being made at this
time to continue the orderly transition of the company's
leadership."

   The appointment of 50-year-old Mr. Shoemate was widely
expected but not this soon, some analysts said, adding that
Mr. Eiszner's bout with cancer may have precipitated the
move.
   As the new chief executive, Mr. Shoemate isn't expected to
sway from Mr. Eiszner's business strategy. "The goals of CPC
are fairly well established," said Lawrence Adelman, analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds. "The focus is going to be on
developing its international packaged food business."
   CPC, with sales of $5.1 billion in 1989, sells brands such
as Hellmann's and Best Foods mayonnaise, Skippy peanut
butter, Mazola corn oil, Thomas's English muffins and Knorr
Soups. It also is a major corn refiner.
   In an interview yesterday, Mr. Shoemate said his challenge
will be to "keep CPC following the strategy that was set by
Mr. Eiszner." He referred to the transition as a "smooth
passing of the baton," and noted that Mr. Eiszner had been
steadily taking a less active role in the running of the
company.
   Mr. Shoemate, who, beginning in 1962, has spent most of
his career with CPC, rose through the ranks, eventually
heading CPC's Canadian operations in 1981. He served as
president of CPC's corn refining unit in 1987, before being
appointed president of the parent in 1988.
