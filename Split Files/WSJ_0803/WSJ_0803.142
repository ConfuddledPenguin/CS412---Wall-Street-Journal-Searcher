   Discount retailer S.E. Nichols Inc., which has been in
default on payment of interest on debt, said it filed for
protection from creditors in federal bankruptcy court.
   The New York company said that while operations of its 16
Pharm-House deep-discount drug stores have been
"encouraging," it faces serious financial problems in
handling its debt and covering heavy rental costs for unused
space. And the company said it has "encountered increasing
problems in obtaining adequate vendor support."

   A month ago, Nichols said it wouldn't make an interest
payment due on $18.4 million of 14 7/8% debentures; it also
has $10.5 million of a 15% series of debentures outstanding,
with a payment due Sept. 1.
   A copy of the filing wasn't immediately available. At May
5, the company's assets totaled $79.3 million and liabilities
$77.1 million. For the fiscal year ended Feb. 3, the company
had a net loss of $37.2 million, or $7.90 a share, on revenue
of $214.3 million.
