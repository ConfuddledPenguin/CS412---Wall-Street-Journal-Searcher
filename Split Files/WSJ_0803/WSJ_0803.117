   WASHINGTON -- Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of
the House Banking Committee, isn't tired of savings and loan
associations yet.
   The maverick Texan populist said he will hold hearings in
September to shed light on the role of government officials
in the late 1970s and early 1980s on the deregulation of
thrifts. Those called to testify include: former Treasury
Secretaries Donald Regan and G. William Miller, and former
top thrift regulators, including Richard Pratt, Edwin Gray
and Danny Wall.

   The hearings, which begin Sept. 12, occur as Congress, the
Bush administration and both political parties frantically
look for something or someone to blame for the mess, which
will cost more than $130 billion, without including hundreds
of billions of dollars more in interest and other costs.
Fraud has received the most blame, and Congress is winding up
the current session with legislation to punish future S&amp;L
looters more harshly.
   Less has been said about the culpability of
decision-makers, who deregulated thrifts while slashing
budgets of examiners who were to police the newly freed
institutions.
   "Today there is mass confusion and mounds of
misinformation about what did and did not contribute to the
savings and loan problem," Rep. Gonzalez said. "We have an
obligation to establish a clear record."
