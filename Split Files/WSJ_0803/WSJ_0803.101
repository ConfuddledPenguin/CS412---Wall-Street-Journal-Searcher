   Allianz AG agreed to acquire the Fireman's Fund Insurance
Co. unit of Fund American Cos. in a transaction with a net
value of $1.1 billion.
   The acquisition fulfills the Munich-based insurer's
long-held objective of gaining a major position in the U.S.
insurance market. Fireman's Fund, based in Novato, Calif.,
operates in all 50 U.S. states, specializing in
property/casualty insurance. The company is ranked 15th
world-wide in terms of premiums, which last year totaled $3.4
billion.

   Under terms of the agreement, Allianz will pay Fund
American $3.3 billion -- but will get back $2.2 billion of
the purchase price by spinning off non-insurance assets,
including its common stock portfolio, back to Fund American.
Allianz officials say the $2.2 billion will be plowed into
Fireman's Fund to strengthen the company.
   This unusual structure was devised because Allianz didn't
want to acquire the common stock portfolio, which contains
mostly oil and gas holdings. Allianz puts most of its
investment funds in bonds.
   The news of the sale sent Fund American shares soaring
$11.625 to close at $49.75 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday.
   Until now, Allianz operated in just 20 U.S. states through
six U.S. subsidiaries, including several life insurance
companies. But they represented only a tiny part of Allianz's
world-wide business.
   The Fireman's Fund acquisition "is a recognition that the
insurance market is a global one. Clients are branching out
internationally, so insurance companies and brokers have to
be there as well," said Ira Malis, an insurance industry
analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore.
   Jack Byrne, chairman of both Fund American and Fireman's
Fund, acknowledged that "too many of our clients were going
global and we couldn't follow them."
   In a statement, Allianz said the purchase will give it
"the desired strengthening of its strategic position in the
largest insurance market in the world."
   For Allianz, already Europe's largest insurer, the
acquisition of Fireman's Fund fits neatly into the firm's
global strategy. Since the early 1970s, when company
officials realized they could no longer expand inside their
home market because of West German antitrust restrictions,
the company has moved aggressively into new markets -- buying
or building up local companies in virtually every Western
European nation.
   Last month, Allianz sparked an uproar when it agreed to
purchase 51% of the East German insurance monopoly, Deutsche
Versicherung AG, thus assuring itself the same overwhelming
dominance in a unified German insurance market as it has in
West Germany.
   Allianz, which has 223 subsidiaries world-wide and posted
consolidated group net profit of 1.16 billion marks ($730
million) in 1989, is also pushing into other parts of Eastern
Europe. Earlier this year, the company bought a 49% stake in
Hungaria Bistozito of Hungary.
   Having conquered Europe, it was only a matter of time
before Allianz found a suitable U.S. partner. "What's
surprising is that they took so very long to finally get
their match," said a London-based insurance industry analyst.
   Indeed, this isn't the first time that Allianz has looked
at Fireman's Fund. Company officials acknowledge that they
made an offer to buy the U.S. company as early as 1985, when
it was owned by American Express Co. The Germans balked at
the price tag. American Express eventually spun off the
insurance firm to the public through a stock offering.
   This time, investment bankers at Lehman Brothers, a unit
of the American Express subsidiary Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., brought the two companies together. Serious talks began
in early June. "We didn't start talking about price until
last Thursday. We didn't arrive at a meeting of the minds
until Tuesday," said Fund American's Mr. Byrne, who
negotiated with the Germans. Fund American's board approved
the sale Wednesday.
   In the five years since Allianz first looked at Fireman's
Fund, the U.S. company has retrenched rather than branched
out globally. The company sold its operations in Asia in the
early 1980s. Since Mr. Byrne became chairman in 1985, he has
pumped $1.7 billion into the company's reserves for future
claims from old health-liability and general-liability
business written on its books in the early 1980s. Fireman's
Fund premiums and market share have declined in the past
three years because it refused to match its competitors'
aggressive price-cutting tactics.
   After the sale, Fund American will basically be a
closed-end investment company. It will hold some cash,
interests in a mortgage company and Municipal Bond Assurance
Corp., which insures municipal bond issues, and a stock
portfolio with sizable positions in oil and gas companies.
   After the closing -- probably in January -- Mr. Byrne said
he expects to distribute about $800 million to shareholders,
with the bulk of the remaining assets expected to be
liquidated within three to five years. "We're going to be a
melting ice cube now," he said. Analysts put book value of
the new company at around $60 a share. Fund American's book
value at the end of June was $35 a share.
   Fund American also plans to repurchase all 300,000 shares
of Fund American convertible preferred stock currently owned
by Ifint S.A., a Luxembourg corporation, for $434 million in
cash plus unpaid dividends.
   Some critics say Allianz is overpaying for a company that
will largely be stripped of many supporting assets. "I'm glad
I'm not an Allianz shareholder," says David Anthony, a senior
insurance industry analyst at Fox, Pitt &amp; Kelton in New York.
"The only people that will be happy after this is over are
the shareholders of Fund American."
   But other observers say the price compares well with
Allianz's other acquisitions and is in line with what other
U.S. insurers have sold for in recent years. In addition, the
weak dollar makes the price more attractive when calculated
in marks.
   Allianz shares dropped 35 marks to 2,910 marks on the
Frankfurt stock exchange yesterday. But trading had already
closed before the acquisition was announced.
   American Express, which acquired Fireman's Fund in 1968,
currently owns $342 million in Fireman's Fund preferred
stock, but it owns none of the common stock, having sold its
100% ownership of the company between 1985 and 1989. An
American Express spokesman said the company received about
$2.1 billion of pretax proceeds from the sale of Fireman's
Fund in various transactions. He said American Express
believes it received "comparable value" to the $3.3 billion
figure after considering American Express's ability to
reinvest the proceeds in the past five years.
   Separately, Fund American said second-quarter earnings
rose 62% to $73 million, or $1.41 a share, from $45 million,
or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said much of
the growth was due to an increase in realized investment
gains. Revenue rose 45% to $189.7 million from $131 million.
