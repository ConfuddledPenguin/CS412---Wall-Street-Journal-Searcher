   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt
&amp; Whitney aircraft engine unit, responding to Pentagon
spending cuts, said it would eliminate 4,000 jobs, or 11% of
its domestic work force, over the next three years.
   The cuts, to be split between operations in Connecticut
and Florida, are expected to be attained largely through
attrition. But some layoffs are probable, the company said,
including as many as 300 this fall in West Palm Beach, Fla.
The cuts will affect all categories of staff, from hourly
production workers to engineers to senior managers.

   "I do expect selective work force adjustments will be
required in some areas," James G. O'Connor, Pratt &amp; Whitney's
top executive, told employees in a letter yesterday.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
United Technologies shares closed at $56.875 a share, down
$1.625 a share.
   The company has a $20 billion backlog of orders for
commercial jetliner engines and the flow of new orders
remains strong, Mr. O'Connor said. But with deliveries spread
over the next decade, he added, "we do not see the commercial
workload sufficiently offsetting the decline in military
sales."
   About 35% of Pratt &amp; Whitney's $7.1 billion in revenue
last year came from military contracts. That percentage is
expected to shrink to 25% by the time the newly announced
cost-cutting plan is completed in 1993, a spokesman said.
   Many aerospace companies, including General Dynamics
Corp., General Electric Co., Lockheed Corp. and Northrop
Corp., have announced layoffs and other cuts in recent months
as the prospect of deep military spending reductions has
grown. In the largest such action, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
said last month it would eliminate up to 17,000 jobs, or 11%
of its work force, by year's end.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney last trimmed its rolls in 1988, when it
began a program to reduce its salaried staff by 2,600
positions.
   The company currently employs nearly 37,000 employees in
the U.S., with about 25,400 working in four Connecticut
plants and 8,400 based in a research and development facility
in West Palm Beach. Beyond those sites, the latest cuts will
also extend to smaller plants in Georgia and Maine; about
7,000 employees working abroad won't be affected.
   Already, about 150 positions in Florida have been trimmed
since January through attrition, and the company is counting
on a 6% companywide annual attrition rate to yield the
remainder of the new reductions. A spokesman said it's too
early to know how many layoffs would occur -- and what the
related costs would be -- if attrition alone doesn't work.
   The military squeeze is expected to hit hardest at Pratt &amp;
Whitney in early 1991, when company orders expire for the
F-404 engine, used in the F-18 fighter, and the J-52, which
powers the A-4. The company has also made engines for the
SR-71 reconnaissance plane, which the Pentagon has canceled,
the F-15 and F-16 fighters, for which demand has trickled,
and the new C-17 cargo plane, now the target of budget
slashing in Washington.
   To minimize layoffs, the company said it will train and
transfer some employees now doing military engine work to new
jobs within Pratt &amp; Whitney or in other United Technologies
divisions. A spokesman said the company hopes to help
compensate for the military cuts by expanding its engine
overhaul and repair business, pushing for more space program
contracts and boosting the use of its gas turbine engines to
generate electricity.
   A union official with District 91 of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which
represents 14,000 hourly Pratt &amp; Whitney employees in
Connecticut, pledged to work with the company to avert the
need for layoffs.
   "Now is not the time for either the country, or the
company, to abandon these fine workers," said Andrew
Romegialli, District 91's directing labor representative.
