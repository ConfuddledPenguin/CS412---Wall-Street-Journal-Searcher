   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it will expand and modernize its
Ivorydale bar soap plant in St. Bernard, Ohio.
   The project includes a 65,000-square-foot addition to the
existing bar soap plant. About 45 to 50 new jobs will be
added to the soap plant, which already employs about 750
people.

   The Cincinnati consumer-products company said there could
be further improvements at Ivorydale. Earlier this week, P&amp;G
won a tax abatement for up to $200 million in improvements at
that site. P&amp;G won't give details on this expansion, but a
company representative said it will cost less than $100
million.
   P&amp;G's Ivory brand soap has been made at this site since it
opened in 1886.
