   Southland Corp., Dallas, said the Securities and Exchange
Commission declared effective the company's registration
statement, which reflected the terms of its revised exchange
offers.
   The exchange offers, which are set to expire Aug. 15, are
the first step of a two-part plan in which Ito-Yokado Co. of
Japan and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. would pay $430 million for a
controlling stake in Southland, the troubled parent of the
7-Eleven retail convenience-store chain.

   Southland said the steering committee that represents its
public security holders supports the exchange offers, which
would give bondholders and preferred shareholders about 25%
of newly issued Southland common.
