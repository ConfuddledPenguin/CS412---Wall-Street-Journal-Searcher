   NEW YORK -- Far from the Middle East battle lines, the
front lines at the New York Mercantile Exchange's oil pits
got mighty rough yesterday.
   Traders, their arms flailing, bumped and bulldozed for
position as the closing bell capped one of the most volatile
days ever in the Merc's crude-oil pits.

   Most traders, hoarse and sweaty, were in no mood to gab as
they sized up their trading positions.
   "Your throat hurts, your feet hurt -- you take a real
physical pounding," said George Gero, a 20-year veteran
commodity trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   When the dust settled, the September crude-oil contract
had jumped $1.57 a barrel, to $23.11, after leaping as high
as $23.80. That's the biggest one-day rise since April 1989,
and the highest closing price for crude oil since January.
   Oil traders thrive on gyrating prices, and there was
plenty of that yesterday as the markets reacted to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. There is fear that world oil supplies
will be disrupted; the two countries are among the biggest
oil producers. Together, Iraq and Kuwait represent more than
20% of the output of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   But the Merc's rough-and-tumble local traders, who jump in
and out of the market trading for their own accounts, don't
keep their eyes glued to the newswires that flash above their
heads on electronic screens..
   "The best way to do it is to go with your instincts, to go
with the trading flow," says Lee Fader, a local trader at the
Merc. "You try to keep rumors out of your head," he says,
adding: "Rumors get you hurt."
   Some locals, for instance, trade on the basis of the price
spreads between oil contracts expiring months apart. Others
use byzantine technical charts to determine when they buy and
sell. Still others size up the feel of the trading pits for
clues, watching other traders' body language or facial
expressions to sense a change in price direction.
   Trading volume of 121,893 contracts at the Merc's
crude-oil ring fell far short of a record, however. That's
because many contracts quickly jumped the daily $1-a-barrel
limit; only the nearby September contract was free to move
more than $1. This means that many traders who had positions
in other contract months weren't able to wiggle out of them.
   On the elevator at the Merc, traders shook their heads and
sized up the damage. "I'm not a happy puppy," said one
glum-faced trader to his buddy. "Don't worry," chirped his
companion. "You're young."
   But oil wasn't the only hot spot in New York's commodity
pits yesterday. Gold prices, after surging more than $13
during the day, closed at $376.80 an ounce, up $3.50 at the
nearby Commodity Exchange here. Volume was a heavy 65,000
contracts.
   Many traders were betting that rising oil prices would
lead to higher inflation. And many people view gold as an
inflation hedge.
   "The first flight {by nervous investors} came into gold,"
says Prudential-Bache's Mr. Gero.
   What about tomorrow's trading? Look for somewhat lower
prices, some traders said, partly because oil and gold closed
well off their highs for the day. But no one was quite
willing to bet big on it yet.
   Says Mr. Fader, the local trader: "It's a crapshoot."
