   Hill &amp; Knowlton, the public relations giant that has made
a major push into lobbying, is trying to boost its Washington
presence by acquiring high-profile lobbyists Wexler,
Reynolds, Fuller, Harrison and Schule.
   The move plunges Hill &amp; Knowlton into grass-roots
lobbying, a particularly fashionable brand of
influence-peddling that is Wexler Reynolds's specialty.
Grass-roots lobbying basically involves organizing local
groups so that the lobbying firms' clients appear to have
widespread local support. Among Wexler Reynolds clients are
AMR's American Airlines, the Insurance Information Institute
and the Motion Picture Association.

   The merger doesn't involve cash or stock changing hands;
rather, Wexler Reynolds's staff simply will join that of Hill
&amp; Knowlton, said Robert Dilenschneider, the PR firm's
chairman and chief executive officer. He said Wexler
Reynolds, with billings of about $7 million, will boost Hill
&amp; Knowlton's Washington office to over $30 million, making it
the second-largest office after New York.
   "They're excellent in some specialties, one of which is
coalition-building. We see that as the future," Mr.
Dilenschneider said.
   Wexler Reynolds's principals hail from the Nixon, Carter
and Reagan administrations. Principal Craig L. Fuller, who
had been chief of staff to then-Vice President George Bush,
becomes president and chief operating officer of Hill &amp;
Knowlton's public affairs unit. He will report to Robert
Gray, the unit's chairman.
   Mr. Gray, who forged his political ties while acting as
communications director for the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign,
sold his own lobbying firm to Hill &amp; Knowlton in 1986.
   The acquisition comes as Hill &amp; Knowlton, a unit of
London-based WPP Group, is about to announce a major
reorganization. Today, the PR firm, the nation's
second-largest, expects to name Thomas E. Eidson, 46 years
old and currently president and chief operating officer of
U.S. operations, as president and chief executive of Hill &amp;
Knowlton International, a new unit responsible for operations
outside the U.S. He will be replaced by John D. Bergen, 47,
who had been executive vice president and head of the New
York office.
   The New York office, meanwhile, will be divided into three
different offices, headed by Peter Rae, 36; Kenneth Altman,
38; and Christopher P.A. Komisarjevsky, 45.
   Several executives outside the U.S. will also be
reshuffled, including David Wynne-Morgan, chairman of the
London office, who becomes chairman and chief executive of
European operations, succeeding Claudio Belli.
   Noting that the newly promoted executives, including Mr.
Fuller, are relatively young, Mr. Dilenschneider said, "We've
begun to put players in place who will have a run at running
the company over the next 10 years." At 46, though, Mr.
Dilenschneider isn't near retirement age himself.
   With the Wexler Reynolds affiliation, Hill &amp; Knowlton is
trying to reinforce its lobbying prowess. It isn't the only
PR firm to buy up Washington lobbyists; its sister WPP
company, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, has also been quite active,
acquiring, among others, Targeted Communications Corp., a
direct-mail firm, and a 30% stake in Charls E. Walker
Associates Inc. But Hill &amp; Knowlton is undoubtedly among the
most aggressive buyers.
   Already the company has built something of a lobbying
supermarket. It has traditional lobbyists who buttonhole
lawmakers. But it also has researchers, economists, political
analysts, publicists, graphic artists, speechwriters and
managers of campaign contributions. It even houses an
electronic broadcast studio, and produces radio and
television spots ranging from video news releases to
documentaries.
   The Wexler Reynolds merger gives Hill &amp; Knowlton even more
clout. Anne Wexler, a former Carter aide who founded the firm
10 years ago, is considered one of the most powerful
Democratic lobbyists in town. She will become vice chairman
of Hill &amp; Knowlton Public Affairs and chairman of the newly
named Wexler Group. Nancy Clark Reynolds, who had been close
to Nancy Reagan during the Reagan administration, will be
Wexler Group's vice chairman.
   Mr. Fuller said Wexler Reynolds decided on the Hill &amp;
Knowlton alliance after discussions with "three or four of
these large organizations." He said the 45-person firm is
merging in part because it's expanding the scope of its
business and working with some international clients that
could be helped by Hill &amp; Knowlton's 64 offices in 23
countries. The lobbying firm, for example, has been
representing American Airlines in its bid to get federal
approval to expand in Latin America, Europe and Japan.
American is also a Hill &amp; Knowlton client.
   Mr. Dilenschneider said that Wexler Reynolds had just one
client conflict with Hill &amp; Knowlton: Wexler Reynolds handled
Coke, which it had to give up because Hill &amp; Knowlton handles
Pepsi.
