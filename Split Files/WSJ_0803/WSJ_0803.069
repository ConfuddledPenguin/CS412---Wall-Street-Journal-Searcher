   WASHINGTON -- Citicorp said it is initiating a shelf
offering of as much as $2 billion in principal amounts of
notes and warrants to purchase notes.
   The New York-based bank holding company said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that notes will be
offered as a series on terms and prices to be determined at
the time of sale.
