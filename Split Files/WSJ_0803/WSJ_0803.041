   TOKYO -- Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.
agreed to establish a company to develop and market
engineering software, the two companies said.
   The joint venture, Toyota System Research Inc., will be
set up next month in Nagoya, with Toyota taking a 65%
interest and computer maker Fujitsu putting up the remaining
35% in the 300 million yen ($2 million) project, Toyota said.

   The venture would aim to match Fujitsu's basic knowledge
as a computer maker with Toyota's applied knowledge as a
computer user to develop software capable of responding to
technological advances in laboratory and factory automation,
artificial intelligence and computer-aided engineering, or
CAE, Toyota said.
   The company will initially focus on developing and
marketing software for the automobile industry, chiefly for
rapidly expanding CAE applications, Toyota said.
   Sales for the first year are targeted at 500 million yen,
with a goal of three billion yen annually after five years.
   Operations are tentatively scheduled to begin in November,
with a work force of 30 people. Over the next five years, the
number of employees is seen rising to 250.
