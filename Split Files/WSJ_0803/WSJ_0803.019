   WAIOTAPU, New Zealand -- For several hours now, beekeepers
have been turning their flatbed trucks off State Highway 5
headed for a clutch of tin sheds. On board are honeybees --
millions of them.
   The sheds are the first stop in a journey that will end
more than 7,500 miles away in Canada where the bees will
start a new life.

   Welcome to Russell Berry's bee farm, nestled in the
rolling green hills between Rotorua and Reporoa on a volcanic
patch of earth called Waiotapu.
   Not much more than a wide place in the road, Waiotapu
boasts four houses, a pub, a gaggle of geysers, boiling mud
ponds, and a population of 20, most of whom work at Mr.
Berry's Arataki Honey Ltd.
   It was the area's geothermal energy and its potential to
fuel his honey-processing business that drew Mr. Berry here
30 years ago. Steam belches from hot spots in the land around
the sheds. A whiff of sulfur is in the air. And bees are
everywhere.
   There are bees in the family car. Bees in the office. In a
nearby yellow brick farmhouse, there are bees in the
bathroom. Bees in the kitchen. Bees in the wash. "They are
always folded up where I can't see them," frets Annette
Berry, who is taking the laundry off the line in the backyard
and who has an unfortunate affliction for a beekeeper's wife:
She's violently allergic to bee stings.
   Mostly there are bees in the main tin shed known as the
honey house. They are pioneers in New Zealand's burgeoning
trade in live bee exports.
   Arataki Honey is one of the nation's largest bee
exporters. In fact, with 17,000 hives, the family-owned
company is the country's biggest beekeeper, about three times
bigger than its nearest rival. "We used to say we were the
biggest beekeepers in the British empire," says Mr. Berry.
But the empire isn't what it used to be, so now he bills
himself as the biggest beekeeper in the Southern Hemisphere.
   The honeybee itself is an import, brought to New Zealand
150 years ago by an English settler known in local bee lore
only as Miss Bumby. Over the years, New Zealand bees have won
a reputation for being good-tempered. Furthermore, their
isolation has kept them relatively free of such ailments as
mites that are a bane to bees elsewhere.
   They are the envy of apiarists around the world who have
been buying the country's queen bees for the past 15 years.
But in 1985, demand soared for whole hives of bees, or
packages of a queen and 9,000-odd worker bees, turning the
annual live bee trade into a thriving, albeit modest, NZ$1
million (about US$585,000) industry.
   What set the market off was a mite infestation in the U.S.
that began to close the bee border with Canada, cutting off
Canadian beekeepers' usual supply. Because it is costly to
keep bees during the cold Canadian winters, beekeepers
normally kill off their hives and start with new stock the
next year. "All of a sudden, there was a big panic about
where to get the bees," Mr. Berry says.
   He was unsurprised if a bit unprepared for the export
upturn. He had been eyeing North America for some time, but
he expected the demand to come later from the U.S., where the
Africanized bee has been heading from South America. Its
dreaded arrival could mean a bonanza for New Zealand's 6,700
beekeepers. They believe that as the sting-happy "killer
bees" infiltrate local hives, American beekeepers will
scramble for New Zealand's placid bees to temper the
onslaught.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Berry is busy polishing his bee-export
techniques, which can be trickier than the uninitiated might
think. The bees fly to Canada -- in the cargo holds of
regularly scheduled passenger flights. And they need special
attention. "Bees can't get too hot or too cold or too
hungry," he says. And they can't get too nervous.
   Putting bees in a confined area "is like putting a paper
bag over a claustrophobic" person, says Murray Reid, a New
Zealand government bee inspector. "They start to fan their
wings and generate body heat and quickly self-destruct." So
Mr. Berry perfected a bee case with 600 well-placed holes
that keep the air flow constant.
   Still, unexpected problems arise in transit. Like the
llama episode. It was Easter Sunday when the Berry family
arrived at Auckland International Airport with a truck full
of bees. The llamas were already there, waiting to go to
Canada -- on the same flight as the bees. When the Berrys
learned that the bees were to be unloaded in Honolulu while
the llamas were sprayed on board with insecticide, Mr. Berry
had visions of his bees succumbing to the spray's lingering
fumes. It took a dozen telephone calls over the next 12 hours
before Mr. Berry could turn the situation around: The bees
stayed on board, and the llamas were sprayed outside.
   To be packed for travel, the bees are quickly dumped out
of their hives into metal bins and rushed to a makeshift
packing area sheathed in a giant mosquito net. There,
shrouded workers bundle the bees into their travel tubes. In
goes the final touch, an inflight meal of a big sticky sponge
soaked in sugar water. By day's end, 704 tubes -- about six
million bees -- are ready for export. And as night falls,
they are loaded onto a flatbed truck.
   At the airport, the truck's driver stores the bees in a
refrigerated cargo room. Unsuspecting passengers check in for
the Sunday 1:15 p.m. flight, blissfully unaware that among
their fellow passengers on the 14-hour journey to Vancouver
are six million honeybees.
