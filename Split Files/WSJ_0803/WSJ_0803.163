   The U.S. Department of Education blocked several attempts
by a troubled student-loan guarantor to stop accepting
high-risk loans that later defaulted, the chairman of the
guarantee concern said.
   Richard C. Hawk, chairman and founder of Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, also said that pressures from
BankAmerica Corp. and the Education Department to settle the
bank's claims on HEAF for defaults in a $565 million loan
portfolio helped precipitate HEAF's financial crisis.

   It wasn't immediately clear how much exposure -- if any --
BankAmerica has as lender of record, as a result of HEAF's
inability to pay on the claims.
   Peter Magnani, a BankAmerica spokesman, said any
"suggestion that BankAmerica is responsible for HEAF's
problems is false." Mr. Magnani said the Education Department
recently determined that all but $100 million of the
portfolio in question qualified for reimbursement from HEAF.
Mr. Magnani said that BankAmerica doesn't believe it is
liable for any claims HEAF can't pay, although the matter of
liability is still subject to a legal dispute.
   An Education Department spokeswoman said HEAF's proposals
to cut back its guarantees weren't allowable under federal
law.
   Mr. Hawk, who will give testimony today to a congressional
subcommittee about HEAF's troubles, said in an interview that
HEAF made repeated attempts from 1987 on to curb its loan
guarantees to students at for-profit trade schools. These
students' high default rates are raising costs and may lead
to curbs in the $51 billion federal student loan program,
which is also the largest source of financial aid for college
tuition.
   Mr. Hawk said his proposals to limit HEAF's exposure to
losses from the BankAmerica portfolio also were rebuffed.
HEAF claims that irregularities, including poor collection
attempts, disqualify all, or most, of the BankAmerica
portfolio from repayment under the loan program. BankAmerica
holds the portfolio as trustee, and has said in the past that
the company it hired to service the loans botched the
collection process.
   "I am a little bit frustrated that there is no
institutional memory" at the Education Department, said Mr.
Hawk. "The difficulty I have with the Department of Education
{people} is that they express surprise and amazement that
we'd have these arrangements {to make trade-school
guarantees}, but when we tried to do something about it, they
wouldn't let us."
   HEAF, a not-for-profit corporation based in Overland Park,
Kan., is guarantor for about $9 billion in student loans.
After declaring two weeks ago that HEAF is having "serious
financial problems," the Bush administration has been working
on a rescue plan aimed at maintaining confidence in the loan
program.
   HEAF "made some errors in judgment" in evaluating the
risks of guaranteeing so many loans for trade-school tuition,
Mr. Hawk acknowledged. He said HEAF's current cash-reserve
position is "about a negative $100 million" as the result of
default claims on these and other loans. HEAF is obligated to
pay lenders 100% when students default, but is receiving only
80% in repayment from the federal government because of a
high loan default rate in HEAF's portfolio.
   When it began to realize it had a serious problem in 1987,
Mr. Hawk says, HEAF changed its loan fee-structure to
discourage trade students and also required that students
from high-default schools have a co-signer for their loans.
The Education Department, he said, objected to the rate
structure and told HEAF it couldn't require co-signers under
federal law. The department has since said that co-signers
might be a good idea. HEAF kept its altered rate structure in
place.
   In early 1988, HEAF proposed canceling guarantee
agreements with high-default schools and "seven or eight"
banks generating high volumes of trade-school paper,
according to Mr. Hawk. Again, Mr. Hawk says the Education
Department overruled him, saying the banks and schools could
be cut off only through administrative proceedings, and only
then if they were guilty of program violations.
   Although many trade schools and their owners since have
been convicted or charged with defrauding students, Mr. Hawk
says such transgressions weren't known to HEAF at the time,
so proceedings weren't pursued. Students remain in default
even when they were fraud victims.
   The Education Department ultimately allowed HEAF to drop
out of 18 states in July 1988; that has curbed its overall
guarantee volume. Had HEAF been successful in stemming
trade-school lending from early 1987, Mr. Hawk said, it would
have avoided insuring $1.5 billion in paper currently
defaulting at a 50% rate.
   Default claims paid by HEAF have been about $750 million
in the fiscal nine months ended June 30. They were $751
million in the year ended last Sept. 30, and $548 million in
the prior year. Mr. Hawk also disclosed that HEAF owes the
federal government $55 million that it is currently unable to
pay, mostly for advances granted by the government against
future claims.
   One of Mr. Hawk's biggest problems is a dispute over
default liability involving HEAF, the government, San
Francisco-based BankAmerica and HEAF's largest creditor,
Student Loan Marketing Association. Also with an interest in
the dispute are New York's Citicorp, seven Japanese banks and
one Dutch concern, all of which issued letter-of-credit
guarantees as additional security for the loans BankAmerica
holds as trustee.
   The loans were sold and repackaged into bonds. The
letter-of-credit banks have acknowledged at least $350
million in payments to bondholders to cover students'
defaults. The letter-of-credit banks have also sued
BankAmerica, alleging it is liable for their losses.
   Mr. Hawk said HEAF this year has rejected $85 million in
BankAmerica claims because it doesn't regard them as
legitimate. "We're shipping them back in boxes," he said.
   An Education Department determination that BankAmerica was
entitled to refunds from HEAF, Mr. Hawk said, was reached
without HEAF's assent and gave BankAmerica special exemptions
to loan-program rules.
   Mr. Hawk proposed to solve the problem by merging with
another loan guarantor that qualified for 100% federal
reimbursement, which would provide resources to pay the bank.
The Education Department rejected this solution.
