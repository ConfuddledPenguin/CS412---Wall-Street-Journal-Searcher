   Over-the-counter stocks plunged to the lowest level since
early May on news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The OTC market's leaders extended their losses as
investors' ardor for growth stocks continued to cool.

   Yesterday's session extended the string of OTC market
losses to 12 out of the past 13 trading days. The Nasdaq
Composite Index fell 7.02, or 1.6%, to 428,99.
   OTC losers swamped winners, 1,548 to 641. Volume rose to
146.5 million shares from 129 million shares on Wednesday.
   Trucking, technology and consumer stocks fell farthest.
But investors paid higher prices for energy-related shares
that could benefit from sharply higher oil prices and the
American Depositary Receipts of some South African gold
companies.
   William R. Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons, Baltimore, said the Kuwaiti situation clouded a horizon
already burdened by an apparent deadlock on the federal
budget and a looming possibility of recession. He added: "You
really didn't see massive selling pressure today as much as
you did a slow and inexorable downward drift as buyers
decided to sit on the sidelines."
   Growth stocks continued to slide. Microsoft eased 3/4 to
66, Intel tumbled 2 1/4 to 40 1/4, Sun Microsystems dropped 1
to 30 1/2, Quantum slid 1 1/4 to 20 1/2, Conner Peripherals
eased 3/4 to 26 3/8, AST Research fell 1 3/8 to 19 3/4 and
Nike lost 3/4 to 84 3/4.
   "They clearly threw the towel in on the growth stocks,"
said Jack Laporte, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price
Associates New Horizons Fund. Mr. Laporte suggested that
continued selling in those stocks was partly triggered by
yesterday's "Heard on the Street" column in this newspaper
reporting that some growth stocks have been ebbing steadily
in recent days.
   Robert O'Toole Sr., head of institutional OTC sales
trading at Shearson Lehman, said he saw some bargain hunting
near the close of the market. But he said prices remained
soft enough for him to expect smaller stocks to open lower in
the morning, with a "technical bounce" higher later in
today's session after the sellers exhaust themselves.
   A number of energy and gold stocks benefited from the
developments in the Mideast. Baker Hughes warrants, which
trade over the counter, surged 1 1/8 to 8 3/4; Forest Oil
gained 1 3/4 to 11 3/4; Dekalb Energy jumped 1 1/2 to 27 1/2;
Energy Ventures rose 1 1/4 to 19 3/4 and Tejas Gas climbed 1
1/4 to 29 1/4.
   Among gold shares, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa
added 3/8 to 31 3/8 and Buffelsfontein Gold Mining rose 3/8
to 15 7/8.
   Tele-Communications eased 1/4 to 13 1/8 on 976,800 shares
after the Denver cable operator announced it will invest $5
million in Video Jukebox Network and help expand that
company's interactive music television channel.
Tele-Communications' planned purchase of one million Video
Jukebox shares at $5 apiece will complete the first phase of
a planned $10 million Video Jukebox private placement. Video
Jukebox closed at 7 bid.
   Earnings news and outlooks again propelled some shares.
   Sierra On-Line jumped 2 to 23 after the Oakhurst, Calif.,
maker of interactive entertainment software for personal
computers reported late Wednesday that net income for the
first quarter ended June 30 rose to 18 cents a share, from 17
cents a year earlier.
   Statewide Bancorp tumbled 1 1/4 to 4 3/4 after the Toms
River, N.J.-based company reported a loss for the second
quarter ended June 30 of $9.43 a share, after an $83.4
million loan-loss provision, compared with net income of 49
cents a share a year earlier. However, Douglas Johnson,
president and chief executive officer, said he believes the
bank can return to profitability "immediately."
   Centex Telemanagement lost 7/8 to 25 3/4, although the San
Francisco provider of telecommunications management services
reported net income for the second quarter ended June 30 rose
to 25 cents a share from 17 cents a year earlier.
   Pointing to Centex's profit gain, Morgan Stanley emerging
growth analyst L. Keith Mullins said in an interview that the
stock's decline shows how the market is indiscriminately
pounding shares of smaller companies, regardless of how
strong their earnings may be.
   Cellcom added 3/8 to 2 5/8 after the Fairfield, N.J.,
communications company said it gained an exemption from the
listing requirements of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory body that operates
Nasdaq. Cellcom, which didn't meet NASD's listing
requirements as of March 30, said it will meet those
standards after it closes a previously announced sale of its
franchise to operate a rural service area in Oklahoma. Its
stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq.
