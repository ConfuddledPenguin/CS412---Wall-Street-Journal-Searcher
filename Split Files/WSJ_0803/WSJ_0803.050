   NEW YORK -- In a letter to shareholders, R.H. Macy &amp; Co.
disclosed it sold a 1% equity stake in the company to
Corporate Property Investors, a closely held, New York-based
real estate concern, for $15 million.
   Macy has said on previous occasions that it would evaluate
offers from potential additional equity partners, and
analysts said the company appears to have gotten a rich
price. According to those familiar with the situation,
Corporate Property Investors expressed interest in making a
stock purchase within the last month.

   Macy said it will use the $15 million to buy back some of
its subordinated debentures on the open market. Macy noted it
would need approval from its senior bank lenders before
making the purchases.
   Corporate Property Investors owns 28 regional malls
nationwide, including 12 in which Macy's has stores.
   "We have plans for expanding and improving certain malls,
and we feel this investment will help us accomplish that,"
said Hans Mautner, chairman of the investment company.
   Macy also said it has amended its bank agreement with key
lenders, as it has for the two previous quarters. Macy will
be allowed to reduce its cash flow coverage ratio relative to
debt from 1.5 times to 1.2 times through the end of the
January 1991 quarter. Management believes this will calm any
supplier concerns.
   Macy executives also said the company is negotiating to
sell the Bullock's office building in Los Angeles to
Alexander Haagen Co., a real estate developer based in
Manhattan Beach, Calif. Some believe the building may bring
about $40 million.
   Macy said that its cash availability has been greater than
expected earlier this year. Macy attributed this to its
conservative inventory levels and expense plans.
   "Given all the debt Macy's has on its balance sheet, the
$15 million is a damn good price," commented Evan Mann,
high-yield bond analyst at Dillon, Read &amp; Co. "From Macy's
point of view, it's an excellent deal."
   Mr. Mann said he believes Macy will have an "okay but not
great" Christmas selling season. If so, Mr. Mann said the
company won't have any problem meeting its debt obligations.
   "The poor performance last Christmas was an aberration,"
said Mr. Mann. "There shouldn't be nearly as much discounting
this year. However, if the economy turns down, and we have a
harsh Christmas, this could force Macy to make some kind of
exchange offer."
   Mr. Mann added that in addition to the office building,
Macy executives may decide to sell some I. Magnin stores in
Chicago.
