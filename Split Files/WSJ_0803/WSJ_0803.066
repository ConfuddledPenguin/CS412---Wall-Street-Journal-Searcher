   NEW YORK -- Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 30% drop in net
income for its fiscal fourth quarter, capping a mixed
earnings season for Wall Street securities firms.
   The big securities firm, citing the cyclical downturn on
Wall Street, said net for the quarter ended June 30 was $33.5
million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $47.6 million, or
43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $640
million from $629.7 million. Many analysts had expected the
firm to earn between 40 cents and 43 cents for the quarter.

   Despite the results, however, Bear Stearns remains one of
the few securities darlings among financial-services
analysts.
   "I'm not table-pounding any of these stocks, but Bear is
the only one I have a buy on," says Larry Eckenfelder, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "It still has
good value and not a lot more downside."
   Yesterday, Bear Stearns shares closed at $12, down 62.5
cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bear Stearns's results bring to a close an uneven period
for securities-firm earnings. For the first time in nine
months, securities firms as a group broke into the black in
the June quarter. But the results were mixed: Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. surprised analysts with a jump in investment-banking
revenue, while Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s shares have
dropped 18% since its disappointing earnings were released
last week.
   Bear Stearns's per-share results are adjusted for a 5%
stock dividend declared yesterday, to be distributed with the
regular quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents on Aug. 31.
   Commissions were a little softer than some analysts were
expecting; apparently an anticipated investment-banking deal
didn't close before the quarter ended, some analysts said.
Commission revenue for the quarter was down 22% to $77.9
million.
   Investment banking revenue rose 4.3%. An increase in
interest and dividend income was offset by an increase in
interest expense.
   For the year, Bear Stearns's net income fell 31% to $119.4
million, or $1.10 a share, down from $172.4 million, or $1.54
a share. Revenue was flat at $2.4 billion. Commission revenue
was down 2% but investment banking revenue dropped 17%.
   Strong performances in the areas of mortgage-backed
securities, government bond and stock trading helped the
fourth quarter, Bear Stearns said.
   In a statement, Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said "fiscal
1990, particularly the first six months, was a tough year for
the investment banking and brokerage industry." In light of
that, he said, "we are proud of our results for the quarter
and the year."
   Indeed, Mr. Greenberg showed good spirit and a touch of
humor about the results. "I have always heard that we are in
a cyclical business. I am eagerly awaiting the next upward
cycle," he said in the statement.
