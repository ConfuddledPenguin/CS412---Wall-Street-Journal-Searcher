   Florida is known nationwide as the Sunshine State. But
it's also getting a reputation as a debtor's paradise.
   Attracted by state laws that shield certain personal
assets, individuals looking over their shoulders at creditors
are streaming into Florida. It isn't clear how many people
move to the state expressly to shelter their wealth, and not
all such moves will survive court challenges. But bankruptcy
filings have increased far more rapidly in Florida than
nationally.

   While the federal Bankruptcy Code applies everywhere,
states can write their own rules about which assets are
exempt from creditors. "In Florida, you can fashion your
ownership of property so you are totally insulated from ever
paying a debt," says Michael G. Williamson, an Orlando
bankruptcy attorney.
   Among the 50 states, only Texas comes close as a debtor's
retreat. John Connally, the former Texas governor, clung to a
200-acre ranch there, leaving creditors to pick over the
remains of his bankrupt estate. The Hunt Brothers also
salvaged big residences despite bankruptcy. Still, Florida
seems to be the favored spot for debtors on the move. "People
don't want to move {to Texas} and buy these houses and see
them go down 30% in value," says Lindsay Sharpe, a bankruptcy
attorney in Austin.
   The centerpiece of Florida's debtor protection measures is
its homestead law. No matter what his debts, a homesteader --
someone who declares a particular property as his principal
abode -- can keep a home of unlimited value on as much as a
half acre of land within a city, or on as much as 160 acres
outside one.
   But that's only the start. The salary of a head of
household is exempt from a creditor's grasp, as are
annuities, certain retirement and profit-sharing plans and
individual retirement accounts. In addition, property owned
by a married couple in tenancy by the entirety -- a legal
form in which each party is viewed as owning the whole asset
-- cannot be seized for debts owed by only one spouse.
   Former baseball commissioner Bowie K. Kuhn, for instance,
moved to Florida last December. His relocation from New
Jersey came just two weeks before a bankruptcy-law filing in
New York by the defunct law firm of Myerson &amp; Kuhn, of which
he was a founding, name partner. By law, individual partners
can be held liable for all the debts of the partnership.
   Mr. Kuhn filed papers in a Florida state court last
December declaring Florida as his legal domicile -- a way of
establishing a homestead. He sold his home in New Jersey in
January and bought a $1 million estate in Marsh Landing, an
enclave in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., a few days later.
   Mr. Kuhn says he "certainly took into consideration the
debtor laws" when he moved to Florida, but also found it an
attractive spot to make a fresh start because of his strong
ties there and the state's professional and recreational
offerings.
   In the spring, Mr. Kuhn was joined in Florida by his
ex-partner, Harvey D. Myerson, who also has obligations
resulting from the bankruptcy of his previous firm -- the
defunct Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp;
Casey.
   Mr. Myerson put up for sale his Manhattan co-op apartment
and East Hampton, N.Y., house and bought a home in Key West
for $1.75 million. The Mediterranean-style, four-bedroom,
six-bathroom property -- including an oceanfront swimming
pool, gold fixtures, a coral staircase and an elevator -- is
tagged "the southernmost home in the continental U.S." A real
estate agent's brochure describes the place as "only 88 miles
from Cuba."
   More to the point, grumble some of Mr. Myerson's former
partners, is that the abode is in Florida. In May, an
attorney representing the bankrupt firm of Myerson &amp; Kuhn
went to federal bankruptcy court in New York for relief.
   "Mr. Myerson is selling his residences in New York,"
Ronald Cohen, the firm's attorney, urgently advised federal
bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram at the hearing. "And we
have learned that he is intending to purchase or maybe has
already purchased . . ."
   "A house in Florida," Judge Abram said, finishing the
sentence. "Beyond ridiculous" was the judge's assessment of
the development. "We've already got one person in Florida,"
she said. "I don't think we should have two."
   Mr. Myerson told his Myerson &amp; Kuhn colleagues that he
wasn't trying to pull a fast one. He agreed to give them a
security interest in his artwork and some New York real
estate to quiet their fears. His attorney, Charles Stillman,
says, "His decision to go to Florida was strictly personal
and not based on creditors' rights."
   For his part, Mr. Kuhn isn't home free yet. After his move
south, Marine Midland Bank, a big creditor, filed suit in a
Florida court, asking for a lien on his Florida property. The
bank alleges he put money into the house to dodge a personal
guarantee of a $3.2 million loan to the law firm.
   "It's an outrage is what it is," says Leon Marcus, a
former Myerson &amp; Kuhn partner, who calls Mr. Kuhn's move "a
great test case" of the Florida homestead law. "I can't
believe the intent of the Legislature was to protect people
under these circumstances. I don't think you have any
instance as flagrant as this one."
   Just how flagrant is too flagrant isn't clear under
Florida law: A certain degree of "pre-petition planning," as
bankruptcy lawyers like to call it, is acceptable. However, a
deliberate move to evade creditors doesn't always work,
particularly if it's taken on the eve of bankruptcy. Under
the federal Bankruptcy Code, if a judge finds a move was made
"to hinder, delay or defraud" creditors, it will be deemed a
"fraudulent transfer" and void.
   Some people have lost their homestead battles. Jake
Butcher's wife left Tennessee and bought a big house in
Longwood, Fla., after the Tennessee banker's empire collapsed
in 1983. But a bankruptcy judge rejected her homestead claim
because she wasn't a "head of household," a requirement since
dropped from Florida law.
   A move to Florida can put a debtor in a strong bargaining
position with his creditors, though, even if he doesn't
ultimately prevail on every point.
   Consider the case of former Ohio financier Marvin L.
Warner. Shortly after the collapse of his Cincinnati-based
Home State Savings Bank in 1985, Mr. Warner put his horse
farm up for sale in Ohio, where only $10,000 of a homestead
is safe from creditors, and headed for Ocala, Fla.
   In the midst of a storm of lawsuits that accused Mr.
Warner of participating in a huge fraud with E.S.M.
Government Securities Inc., a defunct Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
firm, he and his wife filed papers in a Florida court
declaring Florida their domicile and paving the way for a
homestead.
   Mr. Warner bought a 160-acre Ocala horse farm valued at
$2.2 million. He invested $3.2 million in annuities. And he
changed $10.8 million of his assets into property held in
tenancy by the entirety by him and his wife.
   Then, last September, Mr. Warner agreed to pay $16 million
to creditors in a settlement of his bankruptcy case and put
most of his bankrupt-proof assets back into the kitty. He has
kept about $6 million, however, and remains ensconced on the
horse farm, having conceded only to give a lien on it to
ensure payment of the settlement. His conviction on charges
related to Home State Savings and E.S.M. Securities was
overturned on appeal, and the Ohio Supreme Court is reviewing
the case.
   Mr. Warner's attorney, Scott Orth, says his client's
Florida asset transfers were "appropriate estate planning for
a man of his age." Both Mr. Warner and his attorney say that
though he had lived in Ohio, he had strong ties to Florida
where he had kept a condominium for 20 years and wheeled and
dealed in Florida banks. Mr. Warner calls assertions he was
trying to stash assets out of reach "absolutely so untrue."
   Congress is taking aim at one of the more flagrant and
high-profile abuses of bankruptcy. The U.S. Senate passed a
bill July 11 that, among other things, strips bank and thrift
officials of bankruptcy protection for debts arising from
fraud or a breach of duty.
   But drives by thwarted bill collectors to stem unfair
exploitation of Florida's exemptions have received a chilly
reception in Tallahassee, the state capital. Winton E.
Williams, a University of Florida law professor, says any
suggestion of revising the laws is "construed as putting
widows and orphans out on the street."
   Robert Gilbert, former president of the Bankruptcy Bar
Association in Florida's Southern District, acknowledges that
the state's debtor laws provide an "opportunity for abuse."
But he says that there are checks and balances -- "other
statutes that can be used at times to temper or remove the
protections."
   He also argues that "most of the exemptions are geared
toward keeping people off the public dole," and he cites the
"adverse consequences" to a family of garnisheeing a head of
household's wages or limiting the value of the house a family
can keep. "It's a question of where you're going to put the
major burden," he says. "On creditors, who are capable of
taking care of themselves for the most part, or on the
individual who incurs the debt."
