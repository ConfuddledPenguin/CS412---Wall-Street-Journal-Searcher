   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 521 money-market
funds increased $800.1 million, to $395.42 billion, in the
week ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a trade association.
   Assets of 251 general-purpose funds rose $541.5 million to
$136.44 billion, and assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose
$258.7 million to $161.01 billion. Assets of 168
institutional funds were virtually the same as the previous
week, at $97.97 billion.

   "Several consecutive weeks of solid inflows into
money-market funds brought their assets to the highest level
ever," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist
at the institute. He said the increases occurred "despite a
gradual easing of short-term rates and some steepening of the
yield curve," adding that the funds "succeeded in maintaining
their competitive yield relative to alternative short-term"
investments.
   Mutual-fund assets were revised through July 4 to include
eight new institutional funds with assets totaling $2.8
billion. For the previous week, the revised total of assets
of funds is $394.62 billion.
