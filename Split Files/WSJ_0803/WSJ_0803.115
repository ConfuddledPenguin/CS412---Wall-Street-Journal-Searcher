   Delta Air Lines reached an agreement on a new contract
with its pilots that will make them the most highly paid in
the airline industry, a union official said.
   The agreement, which still must be ratified by Delta union
leaders, shortens to three years the length of time new
pilots are paid at lower wages than higher-seniority pilots.
That hotly contested issue had been the main sticking point
in contract talks, which had dragged on for 19 months.

   The proposed contract also calls for wage increases of
12.5% over its three years, with newer pilots receiving on
average a 40% increase over the life of the contract.
   A spokesman for the airline said Delta was pleased to
reach an agreement, but declined further comment.
   Officials of the pilots union said they were satisfied
with the new terms. "We have the best contract in the
industry," said a union spokesman. The union hailed the
contract as a significant step toward eliminating the lower
"B-scale." Previously, pilots had to work at the lower wage
rate for five years before jumping to the higher wages in
effect for pilots with more seniority.
