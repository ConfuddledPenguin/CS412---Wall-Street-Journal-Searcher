   Scientists at Abbott Laboratories Inc. said they developed
an experimental compound highly effective in blocking
replication of the AIDS virus.
   A report by the scientists indicates that the Abbott Park,
Ill., pharmaceutical company has produced a major entry into
a high-stakes race to discover a new type of drug to combat
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The Abbott team, whose
report is carried in the current issue of Science magazine,
said its drug candidate "differs" in important ways from
those reported over the past year by other scientists.

   The Abbott researchers said they have devised a molecule
that can inhibit the action of an enzyme called protease. The
enzyme is essential for the proper assembly and maturation of
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, in uninfected
cells in the human body.
   Over the past year and a half, scientific journals have
carried a sprinkling of reports indicating that pursuit of a
drug to inhibit the HIV-1 protease is highly competitive
between drug company research labs. To date, researchers at
Merck &amp; Co., SmithKline Beecham PLC, Upjohn Co., Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. and a group at Washington University in St. Louis
working with Monsanto Co., have reported producing
experimental protease blockers.
   As yet, all the reports have said that the researchers
have blocked the AIDS virus from infecting healthy cells only
in test-tube experiments. The problem is to produce a
compound that will reach AIDS-infected cells in the body
before it can be destroyed or excreted.
   Scientists at Abbott Labs said they believe their protease
blocker, called A-74704, may solve that problem through its
design. Using computer models of the protease enzyme, the
Abbott team said it made a drug that closely mirrors the
receptor site on the enzyme's surface, which activates the
protease enzyme. The blocker is made up of two identical
halves whose combined shape fits the structure of the
receptor site. Such a compound sitting in the receptor site
would effectively defuse the enzyme.
   "Early on we bet that this symmetrical structure would be
a potent blocker, and we now know that it is," said John
Ericson, lead author of the Abbott report. Mr. Ericson said
the structure also may resist degradation by enzymes in the
gut, a problem that must be overcome before the blocker can
be tested as a potential drug. He said Abbott soon will begin
testing the compound and other versions of it in animals.
   Blocking the HIV-1 protease is one of three major
strategies under way in pharmaceutical labs seeking to
develop novel AIDS drugs. Companies also are seeking to block
an essential enzyme called transcriptase, and to block a
receptor called CD4 that the AIDS virus uses to infect
healthy cells. Scientists think all three types of drugs may
be needed to fight off an AIDS infection.
