   GENEVA -- Japan is maintaining a "hard core" of import
barriers against many farm products and several kinds of
industrial goods, a survey by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade said.
   Analysts at GATT's secretariat said Tokyo has made
"tangible progress" in opening its markets to foreign goods
in recent years, under pressure from trade partners, led by
the U.S., to reduce its surpluses.

   "However, a hard core of high protection has remained,"
said the survey, which also criticized other parts of
Japanese trade policy and predicted rising pressure from
Third World exports.
   Japanese Ambassador Minoru Endo said his country has taken
"giant steps" to lower trade barriers.
   Criticism of Tokyo often seems "to stem from an outdated
perception about us," Mr. Endo told a session of GATT's
96-nation council, which commissioned the review.
   Rice farming is "the most deep-rooted example" of how the
Japanese government gives wide-ranging protection against
foreign competition to agriculture, the survey said.
   Developing countries are especially hit by restrictions on
industrial products, which include leather, jute, clothing
and footwear, the survey said.
   A thicket of trade regulations and official channels was
cited as another import obstacle.
   GATT analysts said that while Japan says it reduced state
aid to farmers 20% since 1986, it "continues to have a highly
protected agricultural sector."
   The report noted that Japan last spring urged major
private companies to boost imports. But it said this approach
could distort trade by promoting only certain kinds of
imports.
   GATT also warned Tokyo against making trade restraint
deals with Third World producers wanting to gain a foothold
in the Japanese market, saying such accords endanger the
principles of international trade.
   Japan has rarely used this method but is likely to face
increasing pressure as developing economies become more
diversified and competitive, the survey said.
   Recent market-opening moves have led to surging shipments
of cigarettes, wine and other alcoholic drinks, fruits, beef,
passenger cars and semiconductors, the survey said.
