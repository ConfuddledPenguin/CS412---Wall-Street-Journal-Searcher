   IRAQI TROOPS SEIZED control of Kuwait after two weeks of
threats.
   Iraq's President Hussein, saying his forces entered at the
request of a group that overthrew the government, warned, "We
will turn Kuwait into a graveyard if any outside power
intervenes." The State Department called the coup report
"patent fraud." Kuwait's leader fled to Saudi Arabia as Iraqi
forces occupied the capital's government buildings and
reportedly moved south toward oil installations. U.S.
officials said the Iraqis took a group of American oil
workers to an unknown site. Diplomats said over 200 Kuwaitis
were killed or wounded.

   Most Arab leaders failed to comment on the action. The
Soviet Union, one of Iraq's biggest arms suppliers, suspended
shipments to Baghdad. Bush froze Iraqi assets, blocked import
of most Iraqi goods and moved to shelter billions of dollars
of Kuwaiti government assets. The State Department said Baker
and Shevardnadze would issue a joint statement today.
   Kuwait asked for U.S. military assistance. A Pentagon
source said an aircraft carrier and six warships were
diverted to the gulf, and Bush said he wouldn't rule out
military intervention.
