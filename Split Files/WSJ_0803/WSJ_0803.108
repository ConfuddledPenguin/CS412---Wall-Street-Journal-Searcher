   New York -- The Mets were hot, very hot, so one recent
Thursday evening 43,647 people paid to enter Shea Stadium.
Among them was an old fan who hadn't attended a Major League
baseball game for 15 years.
   No, he hadn't been in jail -- he'd just been living all
that time in London and Jerusalem, where the closest thing to
the real thing is softball, played in Regent's Park and the
Hebrew University's soccer bowl by nostalgic, aging
expatriates like himself.

   The ex-American paid his $6 and was relieved to see that
the grass at Shea, glowing under the arc lights, still was
genuine. The flag in centerfield for which the crowd rose to
sing the national anthem still was unburned. It still looked
like 90 feet between the bases and the umpires wore blue. The
727s taking off from LaGuardia still shook the guts the way
they always had in the past.
   At first, however, the ex-American was more impressed by
what had changed for the worse than by what had stayed the
same or, even, arguably changed for the better.
   The Cincinatti batters who came to the plate to face
Dwight Gooden, most of whom earn upward of $1 million a year,
looked like Little Leaguers due to their batting helmets.
Gooden's fame and news of his salary had spread world-wide.
So had teammate Darryl Strawberry's. But the other young
heroes and journeymen of the Mets and Reds were strangers to
the ex-American.
   If these were the Mets, where was Tom Seaver? If these
were the Reds, where were Johnny Bench and Pete Rose? Well,
he knew where they were -- in Cooperstown or in disgrace --
but their absence made it a whole new ball game, and, at
first, a less pleasing one.
   The scoreboard also made him cranky. It could and did do
so much more than the scoreboards he remembered. It cued the
cheering. It thundered disco music between innings. It
displayed mug shots of batters on a mammoth screen. It
provided instant replays, and also images in real time of
Gooden expectorating after getting strikeouts, something he
did five times on his way to victory.
   And whoever was presiding over the new, improved
scoreboard warned that anyone using "abusive language,"
drinking in a no-drinking section or otherwise interfering
with the general enjoyment would be arrested.
   What was all this?
   But the ex-American soon got over his first impressions.
All he had to do to get his money's worth was relax and
concentrate on two things: the game and the crowd.
   "C'mon ball, come to us]" It was a seven-year-old pounding
a grown-up glove. He had been brought to the game with his
sister by their parents. Indeed, all the ages, sexes, races
and classes met and mixed and hollered together here, and
once he relaxed this gave the ex-American a cozy, romantic
feeling.
   He could see, out in the parking lot, row upon row of
Hondas and Toyotas in which the middle class had arrived from
the suburbs. He had seen the stretch Cadillacs idled at the
gates for the box seats. He himself, together with the
masses, had come by subway. He noticed Bengalis in the crowd.
And other Asians. There were babes in arms, there were even
WASPs. Looking around him, he could see all these born and
naturalized Americans having a good, non-menacing time.
   For three hours, anyway, the U.S. was an optimistic
democracy again, a winner, something it had ceased being more
than 15 years ago, and baseball was as the ex-American liked
to remember it, the great engine of Americanization and
tolerance. As if to emphasize the obvious, the Mets
management on its triple-threat scoreboard welcomed New York
Bank's foreign exchange traders and Our Lady of the Snow
altar servers and wished happy birthday to Sarah Grossman.
   Maybe it helped that the home team scored first and never
relinquished the lead. There was joy in the bottom of the
second, when Kevin Elster doubled with two on. The game after
that stayed close enough to be interesting, but the Mets had
victory written on them so clearly that their fans could
indulge in all sorts of pleasures besides watching two
collections of highly gifted and very hard-working men,
perhaps even more gifted and better conditioned than in the
past, make a living.
   "Far as I'm concerned," the ex-American overheard one fan
tell his date, "Gorbachev is OK." And then the human wave
business started, very good-humored, very social. It must
have been picked up from TV coverage of World Cup soccer.
"The wave sucks]" shouted someone with a bare chest and a
foaming cup in a no-drinking section.
   He wasn't taken in by the cops, not for his language and
not for his beer. Indeed, though the scene at Shea was
democratic, it was never really rowdy, let alone violent --
the closest thing to an incident came in the fifth, when the
Reds' Eric Davis hammered a homer into the upper deck and
some fan, in a nice touch, threw the ball back onto the
field.
   The ex-American, chewing a high-cholesterol hot dog for
old time's sake, was favorably impressed. After all, at pro
soccer matches in Israel, the fans are separated from the
players, referees and each other by barbed wire, while in
England the riot squad and ambulances are always on hand and
often needed.
   By the sixth, the waves had gone and the air controllers
at LaGuardia were using another runway. It was almost
possible to forget everything, all the years that had passed
and the changes that had come over America, and imagine on
this balmy summer evening that this game was taking place out
of time, floating free of a fairly ugly world.
   Definitely, it was an error for whoever was in charge of
the scoreboard to flash the following headline on it: "DC
jurors see Barry smoke crack on video." But it's possible
that the ex-American was the only one in that happy, gentle
crowd who took notice of such news before the game was over.
