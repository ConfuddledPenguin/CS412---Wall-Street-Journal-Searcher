   LOS ANGELES -- Heritage Entertainment Inc. said it
received a proposal "for a capital investment" and
"restructuring" from an investment group including
Adelson-Baumgarten Productions, Braintree Partners and
East-West Capital Associates.
   Heritage, a maker of low-budget films, wouldn't provide
any details about the proposal or the potential investors.
Heritage said that a committee of its board is considering
the proposal.

   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Heritage
shares closed yesterday at $1.625, off 25 cents. The
announcement came before the start of trading.
   On Wednesday, the company said that the committee
recommended rejection of a proposal from Roger Corman,
president of Concorde/New Horizons Corp., a closely held film
production company specializing in low-budget horror movies,
and his longtime associate, Brad Krevoy.
   Heritage also said it tentatively agreed with City
National Bank to extend the company's revolving credit
agreement to Nov. 1 from last Tuesday. The commitment amount
was reduced to $12.5 million from $15 million.
   Last week, Heritage said it expected to post "significant
losses" for its year ended March 31 because of its
re-evaluation of certain unamortized film costs. In fiscal
1989, Heritage reported losses of $5.6 million.
