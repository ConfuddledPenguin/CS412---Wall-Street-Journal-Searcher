   HONG KONG -- A Taiwan businessman is stalking two of Hong
Kong's best-known corporate raiders, but the stock market is
skeptical that his HK$8.63 billion (US$1.1 billion) takeover
bid will succeed.
   The bidder, Hwang Chou Shiuan, chairman of Ming Ren
Investment &amp; Enterprises Ltd. and owner of a sprawling luxury
residential complex called Hongkong Parkview, is facing an
uphill battle in his offer for two companies controlled by
Thomas and Joseph Lau. The brothers hold 48% of one of the
targets, Evergo International Holdings Co., which is an
investment-holding group. Evergo, in turn, controls 50% of
the other target, the property concern Chinese Estates
Holdings Ltd.

   Some observers would be happy to see the Laus lose control
of their holdings, which include two separately listed units
of Chinese Estates that aren't included in the offer. The
brothers have rankled many market participants with their
takeover attempts and have frequently been criticized for
taking advantage of minority shareholders by giving
themselves hefty directors' fees and rejuggling their
holdings for their own benefit.
   "I think there are a lot of people who'd be happy to see
the Laus leave the corporate scene," said Philip Niem,
research chief at Hoare Govett Asia Ltd. "But the markets are
saying it doesn't really expect this to happen."
   Although Mr. Hwang's offer -- which had been awaited for
about three weeks and was made public late Tuesday -- was
viewed as valuing the two companies fairly, the companies'
share prices showed little immediate reaction. Evergo closed
yesterday at HK$3.775, down 10 Hong Kong cents and below Mr.
Hwang's offer of HK$4.80 a share, or a total of HK$3.03
billion. Chinese Estates closed at HK$2.275, down 12.5 cents
on the day and below Mr. Hwang's offer of HK$3.35 a share, or
HK$5.6 billion. Each offer is 26% below the net asset value
of the targeted company.
   Some traders said Mr. Hwang's bid was regarded as possibly
ushering in a new round of takeover activity. But several
analysts expressed surprise that the bid was launched at all.
When Mr. Hwang first publicly aired his interest in the
companies three weeks ago, some believed the talk was just a
ruse to boost the share prices, allowing Mr. Hwang and the
Laus to make a quick profit. However, many are now convinced
of the bid's sincerity, noting that the financing
arrangements, made through Wardley Corporate Finance Ltd.,
already have involved hefty costs.
   Mr. Hwang's statement accompanying the offer said he was
interested in the companies because he could produce improved
results by better using assets and reducing administrative
costs. He said he would retain the companies' public
listings.
   Neither the Laus nor Mr. Hwang was available for comment.
Evergo and Chinese Estates said holders should exercise
extreme caution regarding the bid and should take no action
until they have considered the advice of directors and
Peregrine Capital Ltd., which has been appointed as
independent financial adviser.
   Adrian Ngan, a property analyst at Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers Hong Kong Ltd., said Mr. Hwang is offering fair
prices for the companies, which own a number of large,
high-quality office buildings in the British colony. The
Chinese Estates offer is more than 25% above the HK$2.65
initially offered late last year by the Laus themselves when
Evergo sought to privatize the unit. That bid, later raised
to HK$2.80, drew little interest and was scrapped.
   "The {Hwang} offer is still below the net asset value, but
for minority shareholders it's attractive enough," Mr. Ngan
said, adding that some holders might be grateful for the
opportunity to bail out of the Lau vehicles. Much grumbling
has stemmed from a decision by Evergo's directors, which
include four members of the Lau family, to award themselves
HK$46 million in fees last year, equivalent to about half the
group's profits.
   Analysts weren't overly impressed by Mr. Hwang's
statement, in which he indicated that parties associated with
him own 5% of Evergo and that Chinese Estate's largest
minority shareholder, Asia Securities International Ltd., has
agreed to sell him its 8% stake. These represent only a
fraction of the Laus' holdings, analysts said, adding that
Mr. Hwang's only hope for winning control of the companies
rests in buying up their warrants outstanding. The Laus own
relatively few warrants.
   Mr. Ngan estimated that the family's total control of
Evergo, when diluted to account for the warrants, amounts to
only 32%, according to the latest figures provided by the
company in December. "The big question now is whether the
Laus have bought more than half the outstanding warrants
during this year," he said. "If they have, the deal will turn
sour" for Mr. Hwang.
   While there have been rumors that the Laus have secured a
credit line with which to make a counteroffer for their
companies, several observers said they doubted that a battle
would arise.
   Vincent Kwan, assistant research director at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Securities (HK) Ltd., said it would probably be
easier for the Laus to buy up warrants in the market if a
defensive tack is necessary.
   "If the Laus decide they don't want to lose control of
their companies, this could be over quite soon," he said.
