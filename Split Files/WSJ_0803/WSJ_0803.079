   DES MOINES, Iowa -- Meredith Corp., hurt by special
charges, reported a loss of $49.9 million, or $2.70 a share,
for its fourth quarter ended June 30.
   The results contrast sharply with the net income of $7.4
million, or 40 cents a share, the publishing and broadcasting
concern posted a year earlier.

   Revenue rose to $185 million from $182.4 million.
   Meredith, publisher of Ladies Home Journal, Better Homes &amp;
Gardens and a host of other largely craft-oriented magazines,
announced in May that it would take pretax charges of $64
million to cover the write-down of certain assets and a loss
from the planned sale of a unit. The final charges totaled
$69 million.
   Meredith took charges of $31.1 million to write down
discontinued operations, including its holdings in the MMT
Sales Inc. television-advertising operation, which it is
selling to a management group; and Meredith's two real estate
operations, which the parent intends to shed.
   Meredith is also carrying as a discontinued operation its
50% interest in a commercial-printing joint venture, which it
has agreed to sell to R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Federal
antitrust regulators last month sought to block that
transaction, and the final resolution isn't yet clear.
   The company also took $36.8 million in charges to cover,
among other things, the write-down of certain syndicated
television programming purchased by its seven TV stations,
and a $5 million reserve for "outstanding claims," which it
wouldn't identify further.
   Earnings at the magazine group were off from the year-ago
period, Meredith said, in part because a one-time accounting
adjustment boosted last year's results. Also depressing the
magazine operation in the latest quarter were expenses for
"new magazine development costs and soft newsstand sales,"
Meredith said.
   For the year, Meredith had a net loss of $26.4 million, or
$1.43 a share, compared with earnings of $33.2 million, or
$1.75 a share, in fiscal 1989. Sales rose 5.9% to $735.4
million from $694.2 million.
