   NEW YORK -- American Express Bank Ltd., the international
banking arm of American Express Co., said it was granted a
limited branch license by the Polish government. The Warsaw
branch, American Express (Poland) Ltd., is expected to open
by year end and will specialize in financial, travel and
tourism-related services.
   American Express hasn't had a physical presence in Poland
since World War II, though its travel cards and traveler's
checks are accepted there.
