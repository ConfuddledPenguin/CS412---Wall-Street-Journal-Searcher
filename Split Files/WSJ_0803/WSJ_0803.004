   NEW YORK -- US Sprint Communications Co., stung by a loss
of market share to its rivals in the long-distance telephone
industry, began a new advertising campaign aimed at reversing
its slide.
   The television ads tout numerous business and consumer
services offered by the United Telecommunications Inc. unit
and invite customers to call a toll-free number to have their
service switched to Sprint from another carrier, such as
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
