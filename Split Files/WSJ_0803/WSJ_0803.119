   Allied-Signal, an aerospace, automotive-products and
engineered-materials company, currently makes
high-performance polyester in North Carolina; its industrial
polyester sales total about $150 million a year, including
European exports.
   The company said the new plant will serve European
customers as well as take advantage of new markets in Eastern
Europe. Although the European tire market currently uses
rayon, nylon and polyester reinforcement, the company said it
believes European tiremakers will "follow the lead of U.S.
and Far East manufacturers who have switched to the use of
all polyester for tire reinforcement."
