   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency, in a
policy switch, said it wouldn't oppose legislation aimed at
limiting the liability of banks and thrifts for environmental
cleanups on foreclosed properties.
   But an EPA official, testifying before a House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee, said the agency will try to craft a
regulation in the next few weeks that would make legislation
unnecessary.

   James Strock, EPA assistant administrator for enforcement,
said the regulation would clarify EPA's opinion that under
the 1980 Superfund law, financial institutions are liable for
environmental cleanups of a borrower's property only if they
were involved in operating the property. Financial
institution trade groups are fearful that some recent court
decisions have expanded that liability.
   Congress currently is considering legislation that would
more broadly exempt banks and thrifts from environmental
liability, but the EPA said it had concerns about such
"blanket immunity." Nevertheless, Mr. Strock said the
administration wouldn't oppose legislation that is "narrowly
focused on the lender-liability issue" and that still
required banks to consider environmental liability in making
loans.
   The issue is particularly sensitive now, while the
government is taking over hundreds of ailing thrifts and
assuming responsibility for their properties. Officials of
the main bailout agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., said
they have identified about 300 properties on which the agency
may have some liability. Mr. Strock said the EPA is
discussing the issue with the RTC.
