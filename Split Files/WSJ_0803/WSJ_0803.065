   IRAQ'S ATTACK on Kuwait rouses demands to temper U.S.
defense cuts.
   The invasion is bound to help Bush's efforts to stave off
some reductions. The Navy is more likely to get funds for
fast military cargo ships. Some aircraft and non-nuclear
missile programs also should benefit from the Mideast
tension. Bush can use the crisis to argue that lawmakers
should consider "what could happen 10 years from now," says
former defense chief Harold Brown.

   Backers of the B-2 use Iraqi dangers to renew their push
to save the bomber. But critics argue that such programs were
meant to deter Soviet nuclear threats, not deal with Third
World blow-ups. House Democrats say their proposed cuts spare
conventional weapons, such as fighter jets, that are most
useful in regional crises.
   Big cuts are still likely, but the crisis changes the
mood. Sen. Dole calls it a "wake-up call" for a strong
defense.
                                                                                                       

   ISRAEL REAPS immediate political benefit from the Iraqi
invasion.
   "Saddam Hussein replaces the Ayatollah as the devil
incarnate in the Mideast, and Israel's strategic importance
is again highlighted," says New York Rep. Downey. The Iraqi
dictator's aggression is sure to shore up political support
for U.S. aid to Israel. The split among Arab nations also is
seen as an opportunity for Israel to face up to long-term
problems in the Mideast.
   "Israel can't afford to have the Saudis under the gun and
neither can the Arab world," says Wisconsin Rep. Obey,
chairman of a House panel overseeing foreign aid. But chances
for pressuring the Israeli government to accept Baker's
Mideast peace plan evaporate as the the Iraqi attack
strengthens Israel's political standing in the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   RECESSION WORRIES, fanned by Iraqi turmoil, hurt GOP
candidates the most.
   Oil-price fears fueled by Iraq's invasion will add to
voter concerns about a sluggish economy, falling house prices
and a possible severe downturn by fall elections. The party
in power usually gets the blame. "Combine a recession with
taxes and the S&amp;L crisis, and you've got a pretty deadly
situation" for the GOP, predicts Democratic political
consultant Paul Maslin.
   Most at risk: incumbent governors in states with soft
economies, including GOP governors in Rhode Island, Maine,
Florida, Nebraska and Iowa. A downturn would hurt GOP Sens.
Coats in Indiana and McConnell in Kentucky, and challenger
Schneider in Rhode Island. Democratic Sen. Baucus is
vulnerable in Montana, where the economy already is bad.
   Most economists think an actual recession will be avoided.
One bright spot: increased U.S. exports to Europe.
                                                                                                       

   HIGHER OIL PRICES from the Iraqi crisis "could hurt" the
movement toward raising taxes on energy as part of a budget
accord, says House Budget Committee Chairman Panetta. A House
Democratic leadership aide says energy taxes are still on the
table for now, but probably would be removed if oil prices
jump sharply.
                                                                                                       

   TAX RESISTANCE is linked to the S&amp;L scandal. "There's just
a sense of rage," says GOP Rep. Gingrich; voters ask if
Congress will "raise taxes for the savings &amp; loan bailout."
Democratic Rep. Williams says voters oppose taxes to pay for
"spending into infinity, and the biggest spending pit to
nowhere is the S&amp;L cleanup."
                                                                                                       

   MONEY FLOWS into Senate races. Texas Sen. Gramm leads the
way with $13.5 million. New Jersey Sen. Bradley is next at
$11.5 million. Others above $5 million: Sens. Helms, Simon,
Boschwitz, Kerry and Levin. GOP Senate hopefuls Rep. Martin
in Illinois and Rep. Tauke in Iowa raise more than $3 million
each, tops among challengers.
                                                                                                       

   FAMILY LEAVE heats up in the states, after Bush vetoes a
federal law. More than 12 states, including Illinois and
Pennsylvania, have bills pending to create or expand
job-protected leave. Democrats push leave "as one of the main
campaign issues" in the Illinois governor's race, says
Shelley Gates of Chicago's Women Employed.
                                                                                                       

   CLEAN AIR LEGISLATION is bogged down by delays and
disputes.
   More than two months after the Senate and House passed
bills, conferees have met just twice. Much of one session was
spent arguing over whether White House aide Roger Porter
could sit in. Environmentalists accuse Rep. Dingell and other
friends of industry of foot-dragging to increase their
leverage. Dingell denies delaying.
   William Fay, head of an industry coalition, says the
biggest threat to the bill "comes from the extremism of the
Senate." He contends senators push to combine the toughest
parts of both bills on such issues as industrial emissions of
toxic chemicals. The Sierra Club's Daniel Weiss grumbles
sarcastically that the process is "moving faster than a
speeding glacier."
   The White House raises its estimate of the annual cost to
industry of each bill to $25 billion by 2005, above the $21
billion Bush said he would accept.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Illinois Rep. Annunzio tells Chicago magazine
he isn't worried about his district being redrawn because
"the only thing that the federal law on redistricting
provides is that the district be congruous and gregarious." .
