   NEW YORK -- Like a fizzling rocket, gold prices shot up on
news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, then fell back as they
encountered profit-taking and other selling.
   "Trading was incredible at the beginning, but quiet at the
end," said Ian MacDonald, vice president at Credit Suisse,
New York.

   "It was a typical knee-jerk reaction that lacked
follow-through," said William O'Neill, senior commodities
strategist for Merrill Lynch.
   Traders decided that, for the time being, the situation
wouldn't worsen, analysts said. They cited condemnation of
the invasion by the U.S., as well as by the Soviet Union and
France, Iraq's largest arms suppliers. And they noted the
comments of the Iraqi ambassador to the U.S. in Washington
that his nation's troops may withdraw from Kuwait in a matter
of weeks.
   Heavy sales by producers, who took advantage of the rally
to fix the prices of their gold at high levels, countered the
gains. Another dampening factor was that crude oil prices
erased about 50% of their initial advances.
   Precious metals futures prices ended mixed and at or just
above the lows of the day. The soonest-to-expire August gold
delivery traded as high as $386.50 an ounce, which
represented a gain of $13.20 from Wednesday's close, before
slumping to finish at $376.80 for a gain of just $3.50. The
most-active December delivery also ended with an advance of
$3.50 at $385.90, just 30 cents above its low, after trading
as high as $394.50.
   September silver rose one cent an ounce to $4.8650, just
half a cent above its low, after being as high as $4.9700.
October platinum's early gain turned into a loss at the
close; it ended $1.70 an ounce lower at $490.50. That was 50
cents above the low and down from the day's high of $501.
   Credit Suisse's Mr. MacDonald said that just before the
gold close he was on the telephone with clients in Kuwait.
"The fighting had died down considerably," Mr. MacDonald
said. "Sporadic firing could still be heard, but it was
quieter than early in the day. The Kuwaitis are very
concerned. Marketwise, we face some very volatile days
ahead."
   Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors of Toronto, observed that in the past decade gold
has gone through wars and all kinds of major global upheavals
and hardly reacted to them.
   "What was the difference now?" he asked. "World-wide
supplies of gold are much tighter than people realize. That
wasn't the case during previous crises. Traders are still so
shell-shocked from the Saudi Arabian sales that they have yet
to become really aware of how the supply-demand situation has
changed."
   A critical factor that will determine gold's future
behavior will be whether the current advance sticks, Mr.
Nichols said. "If it doesn't, it will reinforce the belief
that nothing can really help gold prices to rise. If it does,
there's a good possibility that we can see a $400 price by
the end of the year," he said.
   Early in the day, analysts acknowledged that, in the
tinder-box situation of the Middle East, an Iraq emboldened
by its foray into Kuwait might be encouraged to broaden and
intensify the strife by attacking Saudi Arabia. The two
nations share a long border, and Saudi Arabia also has been a
target of Iraqi criticism over oil policies. However, these
analysts thought such a scenario was unlikely and saw the
crisis as a short-term one, politically and for oil and gold.
   "Everyone's trying to second-guess {Iraqi President}
Saddam Hussein's intentions," said Vahid Fathi, analyst for
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben of Cleveland. "It could be the
annexation of territory disputed with Kuwait, or he may just
be trying to make the point that he is the boss of the Middle
East, or both."
   It is unlikely that he will attack Saudi Arabia, but the
possibility is always there, he said. "It's obvious that
political observers underestimated his willingness to make
war. However, I don't want to read any more into this than
there is at the moment."
   Mr. Fathi said he would have liked to have seen gold's
prices "struggle" up rather than rise so sharply. But he
predicted that after fluctuating, the spot gold price would
rise to $385 or $390 an ounce.
   Anthony Rizzuto Jr., assistant vice president and metals
and mining analyst for Nomura Research Institute America, New
York, saw the Middle Eastern crisis as injecting further
underlying strength into gold.
   "With the Soviets selling diamonds to De Beers to gain
hard currency, the fear that they and Eastern bloc countries
will sell gold has lessened, and that has had a positive
impact" on the gold market, he said.
   Strong oil prices lead to higher gold prices because oil
and gold tend to move similarly, he said, and the possibility
of declining interest rates is indicating softness in the
U.S. economy. "Gold competes with interest-bearing
investments, and gold is looking better against them now," he
said.
   Gold prices are going higher in the fourth quarter and
early next year, Mr. Rizzuto said, and might get up to $425
in the first quarter of 1991.
   One analyst who remained bearish was Ronald Shorr of Bear
Stearns, who said gold would go down before it rises. His
reason: "lower inflation and the era of peace that has
developed between the Soviet Union and the U.S., which has
taken away a great deal of world tension."

   COPPER: Futures prices again rose to new life-of-contract
highs and traded over a three cent-a-pound range before
closing almost unchanged. The September contract ended with a
gain of 0.05 cent a pound at $1.2890, after trading as high
as $1.2980 and as low as $1.2680. Analysts said offsetting
factors tended to create the volatility. On one hand, an
analyst noted, there is strong demand for copper from Japan
and West Germany. Also, there is the expectation that
supplies will tighten toward the end of the year, in part
because producers have encountered operating difficulties. On
the other hand, it's expected that the London Metal Exchange
will report today that warehouse supplies rose as much as
10,000 tons. Also, another analyst noted, the surge in oil
prices caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait could cool
Japan's economic growth, which consequently would reduce
demand for copper.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: The price of pork belly futures
contracts declined the daily limit of two cents a pound for
the second day in a row, eroding part of a strong price
increase that occurred, off and on, over the last two weeks.
Analysts said a significant increase in the number of hogs
reaching the slaughter market exerted downward pressure on
pork belly futures prices. The increase in fresh slaughtered
hogs has the effect of diminishing interest in frozen pork
bellies, which tends to push futures prices down, said
Charles Levitt, livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
in Chicago. Rumors also were circulating yesterday that Iraq
might renege on $2 billion in loans that are guaranteed by
the U.S. Agriculture Department because of the U.S. response
to its invasion of Kuwait.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices ended mixed after falling sharply.
The soonest-to-expire October contract recovered from a drop
to 73.90 cents a pound to end at 75.39 cents, down only 0.03
cent from Wednesday. The most-active December contract
rebounded 1.65 cents from a low of 70.01 cents to settle at
71.66 cents, up 0.29 cent for the day. There were no new
developments to account for the volatility. According to
Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache
Securities, the early losses were an extension of a
deterioration in prices of as much as seven cents a pound
over the past month. There have been some recoveries during
the decline, but yesterday's sharp rebound was stronger than
expected, Mr. Simon said.
