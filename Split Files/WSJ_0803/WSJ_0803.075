   Unusually heavy trading in Fund American Cos. stock and
options before yesterday's announcement of the sale of its
insurance unit to Allianz AG suggests there was trading on
inside information as early as three days before the deal was
disclosed.
   The sharp moves in Fund American securities are the latest
in a series of suspicious jumps in the shares of U.S.
takeover targets involving either foreign companies or
foreign investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission
already has charged a number of investors in connection with
several other deals -- notably, Rorer Group Inc.'s purchase
by Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Contel Corp.'s merger accord with
GTE Corp.

   The SEC began an inquiry into the Fund American trading,
though the agency wouldn't comment.
   The apparent insider trading in Fund American indicates
that despite three years of tough prosecutions of inside
trading and related crimes, U.S. regulators and law
enforcement officials haven't frightened away many
individuals who abuse inside information to make trading
profits.
   "Greed is as American as apple pie," said Bruce Baird,
former chief of the securities and commodities fraud unit in
the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, who prosecuted major
insider-trading cases. Mr. Baird is now an attorney at the
Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling.
   Allianz AG, Europe's largest insurance company, announced
a $3.3 billion purchase of Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. from
Fund American. But trading in stock and options of Fund
American suggests that some investors knew by Monday that a
transaction was pending. Under terms of the agreenment, Fund
American will buy back Fireman's non-insurance assets for
$2.2 billion, making the net cost to Allianz of the insurance
business $1.1 billion.
   On the Chicago Board Options Exchange, volume in September
40 call options on Fund American stock began an explosive
rise Monday. Trading in these calls surged from 41 contracts
Friday to 415 Monday, 897 contracts Tuesday and 1,891
Wednesday, according to CBOE records. The options give a
holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares
of Fund American at $40 each.
   On Wednesday, $133,000 of September 40 calls were
purchased in two large blocks near the close of trading. When
the market opened yesterday, and the Allianz deal was
announced, the value of the two blocks leaped-creating an
instant profit of $450,000.
   "There was above-average volume in an illiquid option,
reflecting speculation that a takeover price would come above
$42.50 in the next six weeks," said Michael Schwartz, chief
options strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Yesterday, Fund
American stock closed at $49.75, up $11.625.
   Said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Cowen &amp;
Co., "It certainly looks as if somebody knew or thought they
knew something was going to happen to the stock."
   A CBOE spokesperson said the exchange has begun a routine
investigation on recent trading in Fund American options.
   Meanwhile, on the New York Stock Exchange, Fund American's
stock climbed $3.125 a share in the three days prior to
yesterday's announcement. On Tuesday, the stock traded
611,900 shares, and on Wednesday, 511,800 shares; volume on
both days was about four times Fund American's average daily
volume of 138,000 shares. There was no significant news
released about the company during the three days prior to the
announcement.
   A Big Board spokesman said the unusual price and volume
activity has triggered a routine probe by the exchange.
Typically, the Big Board determines within six weeks whether
the trading warrants further investigation.
   Fireman's Fund is only the latest in a series of recent
takeovers that have been marred by unusual, and possibly
illegal, trading patterns, according to regulators and
traders.
   In January, the SEC charged several foreign firms and
investors with insider trading in the securities of Rorer
Group before an announcement that the drug company would be
acquired by French chemical company Rhone-Poulenc. Those
trades allegedly were done through Swiss banks.
   Just two weeks ago, the agency again pressed
insider-trading charges, this time in connection with options
and stock trading of Contel before the phone company's
announcement of a $6.2 billion merger with GTE. Again, the
SEC said the trades were made through Swiss accounts. The SEC
acted quickly to freeze accounts and charged "an unknown"
group of investors with insider trading.
   Around the same time, options traders at the American
Stock Exchange noticed sharp moves in the price of Motel 6
Limited Partnership options well before that company
announced a plan to be acquired by France's Accor S.A. But
published reports about a rumored deal preceded that
announcement, and no SEC charges have been brought.
   Recent SEC enforcement actions spotlight frequent foreign
involvement in alleged insider trading cases. "Europeans just
haven't gotten the message that they may be subject to U.S.
securities laws even though they maybe sitting in Switzerland
or Liechtenstein or someplace," said John Olson, a Washington
securities lawyer. "We don't see as many domestic people
involved because I think the message is pretty well out
here," he said.
   He and other lawyers said that in many foreign countries,
investors don't necessarily think it is wrong to trade on
confidential information.
   "The sensitivity of foreigners to the nuances of our
market is still evolving," said Harvey Pitt, another
Washington securities lawyer. "It has only been in the last
five or six years that most European countries have changed
their views on insider trading" to move closer to U.S.
regulations.
   Mr. Olson said he expects it will be several years before
the SEC and other countries' enforcement organizations are
able to start slowing the pace of insider trading. "The real
problem is that it takes time to get that message across,"
Mr. Olson said. "You just have to charge more crooks."
   Illegal foreign trades in U.S. stocks are among the
toughest for the agency to prove, though. The SEC has been
successful at convincing courts to freeze the assets of
alleged wrongdoers before they can complete the sales of
securities and take the funds out. But after that, the agency
is forced to rely on agreements with foreign countries for
cooperation to prosecute those individuals.
