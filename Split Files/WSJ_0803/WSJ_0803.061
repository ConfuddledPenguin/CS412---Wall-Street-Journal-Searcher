   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said it filed a
shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to offer up to $1 billion in debt securities and
warrants.
   The big Coke bottler, 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co., said it
planned to offer senior debt securities and warrants to buy
debt securities, among other issues. The offerings, it said,
would be made "from time to time."

   In November, Coca-Cola Enterprises had made a similar $1
billion shelf registration. A spokesman said that there have
been several note issues since then, including a $250 million
offering in March, and that most of the previous shelf filing
authorization has been exhausted.
