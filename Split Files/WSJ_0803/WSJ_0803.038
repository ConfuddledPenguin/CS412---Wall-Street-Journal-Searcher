   PARIS -- Cement maker Lafarge Coppee S.A., judged a prime
takeover target because of its loosely structured capital
base, plans to adopt a "poison pill" strategy to ward off
potential predators.
   Europe's largest cement company announced that, in the
event of an unwelcome takeover attempt, it will launch bids
for the shares its doesn't already own in three of its
foreign units -- Lafarge Corp. of the U.S., Cementia AS of
Switzerland and Asland S.A. of Spain.

   As a result, any buy-out attempt would have to include a
bid for the entire ensemble, boosting the cost of the
takeover to about 40 billion francs ($7.52 billion) from the
25 billion francs needed to take control of the parent
company.
   The parent currently holds 57.4% of Lafarge Corp., 60.4%
of Cementia and 49.8% of Asland.
   The plan is subject to approval by the Comite des
Operations des Bourses, France's regulatory body for the
equities market.
