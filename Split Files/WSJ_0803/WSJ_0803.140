   NEW YORK -- Solomon S. Steiner, founder of Clinical
Technologies Associates Inc., filed suit, charging three
company directors with improperly trying to oust him from his
position as president and chief executive officer.
   In a lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan,
Mr. Steiner charged Chairman Arnold J. Friedhoff and
directors Howard M. Pack and Luis Menocal III with
"unjustified and improper acts" designed to "(entrench)
themselves in control" of Clinical Technologies.

   On Tuesday, the company announced that its board had voted
3-2 to dismiss Mr. Steiner and name Michael M. Goldberg,
founding partner of an investment firm specializing in
health-care companies, to the top operating posts.
   The Elmsford, N.Y., company is developing a technology by
which drugs that presently can be administered only by
injection -- such as insulin for diabetics -- can be taken
orally. Mr. Steiner, who has a doctorate in physiological
psychology, founded Clinical Technologies in 1985.
   Messrs. Friedhoff, Pack and Menocal couldn't be reached
for comment. Scott Mollen, an attorney for Clinical, said the
company filed a countersuit against Mr. Steiner. He said the
company denies the charges, and is "confident the parties
will work out their disputes."
