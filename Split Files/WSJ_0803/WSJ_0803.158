   MONTREAL -- Pierre Jeanniot, president and chief executive
officer of Air Canada, resigned unexpectedly.
   Air Canada said Mr. Jeanniot, 57 years old, decided to
take early retirement effective immediately. The airline said
Claude Taylor, 65, chairman, will assume Mr. Jeanniot's
duties for the time being. An Air Canada spokesman said there
isn't a timetable for choosing a successor to Mr. Jeanniot
but added that "it is a priority." Through a spokesman Mr.
Jeanniot and Mr. Taylor declined to comment.

   The spokesman said Mr. Jeanniot "felt it was time to take
early retirement."
   Mr. Jeanniot was considered a likely successor to Mr.
Taylor as chairman. A 35-year veteran of the airline, Mr.
Jeanniot was named chief operating officer in 1983 and
president and chief executive in 1984.
   Air Canada, the country's largest airline, was a
government-owned corporation until recently. It was
privatized in two steps in 1988 and 1989. Since privatization
the airline has been putting emphasis on developing its
international operations, expanding service in Europe and
Asia. It also wants to increase service in the U.S. market.
   Possible internal candidates for Mr. Jeanniot's job
include Leo Desrochers, executive vice-president, marketing,
an analyst said. One possible outside candidate is Donald
Carty, an executive at AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit,
the analyst added. Mr. Carty was president of a predecessor
company of PWA Corp.'s Canadian Airlines International unit,
Air Canada's main competitor. Mr. Desrochers and Mr. Carty
couldn't be reached for comment.
