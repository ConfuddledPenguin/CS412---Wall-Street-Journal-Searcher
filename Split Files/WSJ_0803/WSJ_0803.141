   Trimedyne Inc. said it received approval from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to market a laser for use in
removing gall bladders.
   Trimedyne said the laser, which stops bleeding as it cuts,
makes a one-inch incision in the abdomen instead of the
six-to-eight-inch opening required in traditional gall
bladder surgery. About 500,000 gall bladder surgeries are
performed annually in the U.S., the Tustin, Calif.-based
company said.

   A Trimedyne spokesman said the company expects the
approval to "significantly increase sales" for its Optilase
1000 laser, which costs about $100,000. Trimedyne currently
has about 460 of the lasers installed in U.S. hospitals that
until now have been used mainly for vascular surgery.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Trimedyne shares
rose 87.5 cents to $2.625.
