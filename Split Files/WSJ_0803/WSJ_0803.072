   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent prices of oil and gold
jumping and prices of stocks skidding. That is, it's a push
toward both inflation and recession. But this only continued
the recent trend. Stocks started retreating from their highs
with Dick Darman's "crisis" budget review, and indicator
after indicator has suggested a flattening real economy. Yet
rising gold and a falling dollar have suggested more
inflation, voting no confidence in the Federal Reserve's July
easing.
   The military developments in the Gulf, in short, are a
fresh reason to doubt that this is the time to increase
taxes. Since when, and in what economic model, do higher
taxes forestall recessions? With Saddam Hussein threatening
to slap an energy tax of his own on Western consumers, why
should the U.S. budget summit slap them with another?
Especially so since the inflation numbers suggest the Fed
cannot afford to bail out the deal with easier money. The
fiscal-monetary mix of higher taxes and easy money, indeed,
has always been a prescription for stagflation.

   If the Fed is going to have to fight inflation, we will
have to find another policy lever to stimulate real growth.
We can rule out Keynesian pump-priming, for both technical
and political reasons. Spending cuts would help by relieving
government demands on real resources, but no one really
expects that from the summit. What the economy needs is a
sound dollar to fight inflation, and incentive-directed tax
cuts to stimulate growth. That is, monetary restraint and tax
cuts, the supply-side policy mix that curbed stagflation
under President Reagan.
   Fed Chairman Greenspan, already having taken back the
language that suggested easier money if taxes were increased,
can be counted on to keep an eye on the dollar. Happily, the
U.S. Senate will shortly have a chance to vote on the fiscal
side of the prescription.
   When the bill raising the debt ceiling comes up today or
this weekend, Senators Connie Mack and Bob Kasten will offer
an amendment to cut the capital-gains tax, a clean proposal
with a 15% rate after a one-year holding period. When
Majority Leader George Mitchell personally stopped a
capital-gains cut last year, we predicted it would slow the
economy. Now it has; it's time for the Senate to do what a
majority wanted to back then.
   Especially so since a capital-gains cut would increase
property values, directly easing the burden of the savings
and loan bailout. Only yesterday, William Seidman, chairman
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., testified that a
capital-gains tax cut would boost sales of foreclosed S&amp;L
assets. He told the Senate Banking Committee, "There's no
question in my mind that a great many people who are
purchasers are buying these assets for the purpose of seeing
them appreciate and then selling them, and clearly, if the
tax rate were lower, they would be more interested."
   We know that Senator Mitchell and other Democrats complain
that capital gains is a tax cut for "the rich," and refuse to
accept studies -- most recently by Allen Sinai -- that with a
lower rate the rich would pay more total taxes. We sometimes
suspect they want a recession for political reasons. But it's
OK by us if they help lower-income taxpayers by passing
another amendment, Senator Daniel P. Moynihan's proposal to
phase down the Social Security payroll tax.
   Unlike the capital-gains tax cut, the Moynihan proposal
would reduce federal revenues. That is, the incentive effects
are not so powerful, but they are powerful enough that the
Moynihan loss would not be as large as depicted by the usual
static models. Studies by former Treasury economists Gary and
Aldona Robbins show that every $1 cut in the payroll tax
would produce about 55 cents of new economic output and 15
cents to 20 cents of revenue to the federal government. Over
five years the Moynihan plan would probably cost Washington
only about $40 billion in revenue, or roughly the same as the
gain Mr. Sinai predicts from the capital gains cut.
   The package of the two would be a powerful jump-start for
the general economy, but would produce screams from both
Senator Mitchell and those who share his ideological tic, and
from a White House that's persuaded itself the whole universe
revolves around the deficit. But especially with the new
Iraqi threat to the economy, the Senate majority is still
free to do the right thing.
