   Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said its group net profit rose
8% in the first half of 1990, to 352 million German marks
($221.5 million) from 325 million marks a year earlier.
   Sales increased 2%, to 13.84 billion marks from 13.54
billion marks.

   BMW attributed the relatively modest rise in group sales
to the mark's strength, which reduced foreign-currency sales
revenue when converted into marks.
   The West German auto maker said earnings were helped by a
decline in raw-materials prices, but noted that these prices
have started to rise again. Nevertheless, it said suppliers'
rationalization measures had managed to keep prices paid for
components and parts stable.
   BMW's car production rose 2% to 278,470 from 272,217 a
year earlier.
   Earnings and sales for the year are likely to develop
"satisfactorily," the company said. It said increases in
people's real income warrant expectations of continuing good
business for the car industry.
   BMW expects to produce more than 500,000 cars this year.
It produced 511,476 last year.
