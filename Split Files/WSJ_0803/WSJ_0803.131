   NEW YORK -- The American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the profession's chief U.S. body, took a step
toward limiting accountants' individual liability in some
circumstances.
   The group's board recommended that members vote on a
proposal to allow accountants to form their practices as
commercial corporations. That form of organization would
effectively limit the liability exposure of individuals in
the firm. A more controversial proposal to allow non-CPAs to
own stock in such corporations was dropped from the board's
recommendation.

   The recommendation isn't likely to be submitted to the
group's entire 300,000 members before next year, but it faces
major hurdles even if approved. Such a change would also need
endorsement by state accounting bodies or state statutes,
which could take years to accomplish.
   "It is highly doubtful the states will go along with
this," asserted Dan L. Goldwasser, counsel on professional
liability matters to the New York State Society of CPAs.
"State regulators feel very strongly they're there to protect
the public and that professionals should be responsible for
their actions."
   The proposal comes at a time when accountants find
themselves involved in a sharply rising number of lawsuits
accusing them of failing to detect or disclose financial
problems at companies they audit. At the same time, Congress
is considering legislation to require accountants to more
aggressively identify and disclose potential illegalities to
company management and directors or, if necessary, to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Currently, institute rules allow accountants to practice
only as proprietors, in a partnership, or a professional
corporation. In those circumstances, individuals are exposed
to unlimited liability. In a partnership, members also are
individually liable for other members, and rules on liability
of members in a professional corporation vary according to
state law. None of the big U.S. accounting firms has
organized as a professional corporation, largely because they
operate across state lines.
   "The thinking {behind the proposal} is to relieve
individuals of their unlimited liability in practice . . .
even for their own mistakes," said Donald J. Schneeman,
secretary and general counsel of the accounting institute. He
said that in a corporation its assets would be at risk rather
than the assets of individuals.
   James Emerson, editor of Professional Services Review, an
industry newsletter, said: "I can't imagine any state
permitting the practice of public accounting under the shield
of a regular corporation."
   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of a House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee that has held hearings on the
accounting profession, said he "would be concerned with any
effort to change or reduce the professional responsibilities
of accountants."
