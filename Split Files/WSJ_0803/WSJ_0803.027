   When the 112 AK-47-toting members of the Jamaat al
Muslimeen, or People of Islam, seized the Parliament of
Trinidad and Tobago along with the prime minister and 40
other hostages -- allegedly to rid Trinidad of a corrupt and
unpopular government -- news accounts portrayed it as an act
of terrorism by a fringe Moslem fundamentalist group.
Subsequent reports revealed that the group received training
in Libya and that Yasin Abu Bakr, the group's leader,
acknowledged traveling to Libya and called Col. Moammar
Gadhafi "our friend." The U.S. State Department, though
critical of Libya's involvement, says no apparent direct link
exists between the terrorists and Libya.
   That is surprising. A 1986 State Department report charged
that "Libya has also actively recruited members of . . .
leftist leaders from Antigua, Barbados, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the French
Departments {who are} invited to Libya for seminars at which
they are urged to undertake violent action rather than
peacefully participate in the political process." The report
concluded that "Libyan activities should be a matter of
serious concern for the entire hemisphere." Since then,
Libyan involvement in the Caribbean has continued if not
increased. Moreover, it appears Col. Gadhafi has enlisted
terrorist groups from the Middle East and Europe with close
ties to Libya.

   In April 1987, Venezuela expelled a Libyan diplomat "for
allegedly being involved in activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status" -- a euphemism for spying or terrorism.
The "diplomat," Abdul Salim Ashur, was later arrested. In his
possession authorities found evidence of a "huge terrorist
operation directed against the Lesser Antilles": read
Trinidad. The Arab Press Service reported that Mr. Ashur's
plans called for Libya's financing and arming of radical
groups in French Guiana, Suriname, Haiti, Jamaica and, yes,
Trinidad and Tobago (as well as other Caribbean islands).
   Throughout the region, Libya has set up "People's Bureaus"
and Islamic schools and centers that act as front
organizations to conceal Libya's active recruitment and
financing of regional subversives. Since 1986, delegates from
leftist Caribbean organizations have attended the
"International Center for Combating Imperialism" conference
held every year in Tripoli. Through these instruments, Libya
has succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with a
well-trained cadre of terrorists.
   Two months ago, 15 pro-Libyan terrorists were indicted in
Costa Rica for various terrorist acts, including three
bombings of U.S. offices in Costa Rica between 1986 and 1988.
The group, the Santamaria Patriotic Organization, was formed
in 1986 following the U.S. bombing of Libya in April. One of
the terrorists, Domingo Solis Solis, was reported to have
joined the El Salvadoran communist FMLN guerrillas in their
military offensive last November.
   Middle Eastern radicals operate in South America as well.
In May 1987, Venezuelan authorities arrested Mahmoud Abed
Atta, reportedly a senior agent of terrorist Abu Nidal, and
had him deported. Another man with reported Abu Nidal links,
Hussein Bouzildi was arrested by Peruvian authorities two
months after the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement bombed a
U.S. Information Service Center to mark the anniversary of
the April 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli.
   Besides Tupac Amaru, other Latin American radical groups
receive Libyan support, including Ecuador's Alfaro Lives,
Carajo], Colombia's 19th of April Movement and Chile's
Movement of the Revolutionary Left. All have sent guerrillas
to training camps in Libya and received financial support
from Col. Gadhafi.
   Perhaps the most disturbing terrorist event in the
hemisphere with possible Libyan connections is the bombing by
the Medellin cocaine cartel of a Colombian Avianca plane last
November in which 107 people were killed. Though no evidence
directly implicates Libya, major aspects of the case suggest
an indirect role.
   Interpol informed Colombian authorities that guerrillas of
the Basque separatist group, ETA, carried out the bombing for
the Medellin cartel. The subsequent investigation revealed
the guerrillas used Semtex, a Czechoslovakian-made explosive
that cannot be detected by airport security checkpoints. The
ETA receives financial support from Libya and many of its
members go there for training. Moreover, Czechoslovakia's
President Vaclav Havel disclosed in March that the previous
communist government sold Libya 1,000 tons of Semtex. Quoting
from government sources, the Bogota-based newspaper El
Tiempo, reported that "the same detonator was used to blow up
the Pan Am plane on a flight from Britain to the United
States in December 1988." Libya has been directly linked to
that bombing as well.
   The coup attempt in Trinidad is the tip of the iceberg.
The social dislocation and resentment accompanying economic
restructuring have weakened already fragile Caribbean
democracies and simultaneously created an unstable political
environment susceptible to exploitation by radical groups. We
should expect more terrorism traced backed to Libya.
