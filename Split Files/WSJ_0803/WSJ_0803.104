   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.,
mass merchandising rivals for more than a century, said they
held discussions about "certain joint opportunities," but
that the talks had ended.
   The two retailers, run by brothers Edward Brennan at Sears
and Bernard Brennan at Montgomery Ward, added only that they
each affirmed "their intention to remain independent."

   But analysts speculated that the two companies may have
been considering a merger and that Montgomery Ward initiated
the talks. Any such combination would have faced big
regulatory hurdles. Sears, with 850 stores and 1989
merchandise group revenue of $31.6 billion, is the nation's
largest retailer. Montgomery Ward, with 336 stores and 1989
revenue of $5.03 billion, is the nation's ninth largest
retailer.
   At the very least, the fact that Sears would enter into
talks underscores the problems it faces as it tries to revive
its core retailing operation. The company has tried several
new strategies in recent years, including last year's
"everyday low pricing" policy, but retail earnings have
hovered far below their 1984 peak. "It's clear that they are
now stymied and looking for alternatives," said Leo Shapiro,
a market researcher in Chicago.
   Investors, meanwhile, are growing increasingly impatient
with the company's slow progress. Sears isn't considered a
takeover target because of its size. But lately some industry
experts have suggested that Sears consider selling its
merchandise group and concentrate on its financial service
operations. They include its Allstate insurance, Dean Witter
brokerage and Coldwell Banker real estate operations.
   The talks with Montgomery Ward "raise the possibility that
the Sears merchandise group is quietly up for sale," said
Margo McGlade, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. "But," she
added, "who besides Ward would want it?"
   Of all of its competitors, Montgomery Ward most closely
mirrors Sears. Both companies once sold only house brands,
but decided recently to add name-brand goods to compete more
effectively with specialty stores and discounters stealing
market share. Both serve middle-income shoppers, often in the
same mall.
   But Ward is further along with the strategy than Sears.
One reason is that Bernard Brennan, who got his start at
Sears but left in 1976 with a boast that the company wasn't
big enough for two Brennans, has cut costs more deeply than
his brother. He closed Ward's unprofitable catalog operation
in 1985 and sold its Jefferson Ward chain of discount stores.
He also started adding brand names in earnest earlier than
Sears.
   The result: Ward's annual profit nearly tripled to $150
million last year from $53 million in 1985, when Mr. Brennan
was recruited as president. Two years ago, he led a
management buy-out of Ward from its former parent, Mobil
Corp.
   Analysts nevertheless were surprised to learn that the two
companies were talking. "This is Ford talking to General
Motors," said Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities. "Who
would have believed it?"
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Sears closed at $32.875, down 37.5 cents.
Montgomery Ward does not trade publicly.
