   OIL PRICES SOARED and stock and bond markets tumbled
world-wide in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Crude
prices rose as much as $3.50 a barrel and some analysts
forecast a $30 price. Oil and defense stocks rallied but most
issues sank on fears that costly petroleum will drag down the
economy. The Dow Jones industrials fell 34.66 points, and
Tokyo stocks plunged. The dollar surged against the yen, but
gained little against the mark. Gold prices rose.
