   RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. said
preliminary sales for the first quarter ended July 29,
slipped 1.5% to $389 million from $394.9 million a year ago.
   The company said a strong sales performance by its
manufactured-housing group was more than offset by a 6%
decline in recreational-vehicle revenue. Lower
recreational-vehicle sales are "a result of a continuing
slowdown in consumer spending, caused by concerns about a
weakening economy and the threat of a recession," said Glenn
Kummer, Fleetwood president.
