   West Germany's largest banking group, Deutsche Bank AG,
reported yesterday that its partial operating profit in the
first half of 1990 rose 18% to 2.2 billion marks ($1.39
million) from 1.869 billion marks in the first six months of
last year.
   Deutsche Bank was the third major West German banking
group to report firm first half growth in its partial
operating profit, which is before taxes and excludes results
from the bank's trading activities for its own account.

   Deutsche Bank didn't provide specific figures over
earnings that include results from its own trading
activities. But the company said such full operating profit
in the first half rose 17% when compared with one-half of the
full-year total in all 1989.
   West German banks usually don't publish what their full
operating profit is. They simply characterize it or disclose
percentage changes. That is because the banks claim that the
results of their trading activities should be confidential.
   Deutsche Bank said that its 1990 first-half world-wide
group results were aided by the first-time inclusion of
recent acquisitions. Most notable of these were U.K. merchant
bankers Morgan Grenfell and German specialty banking group
Grunelius KG, among others.
