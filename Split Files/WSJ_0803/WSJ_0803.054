   Who knows, in this era of instant communication maybe
Saddam Hussein was watching the U.S. House of Representatives
this week on C-Span.
   If he gets cable, the Iraqi tyrant could have seen Les
Aspin explain why he wants to kill the B-2 Stealth bomber.
The Soviet threat is gone, said the Armed Services Committee
chairman and supposedly the stoutest hawk among House
Democrats. "Something's got to go." So a bomber with a
10,000-mile range and big weapons payload -- the kind that
could hit or deter Iraq -- isn't needed.

   Maybe Mr. Hussein saw Florida Rep. Charles Bennett boast
that he's helping to "bring down the Navy from a 600-ship
objective and 500 and more ships to something less than 400."
In the event this week, the U.S. had six small warships in
the Persian Gulf.
   Or perhaps the Butcher of Baghdad caught Rep. Pat
Schroeder (D., Colo.) defending her subcommittee's decision
not to pay to transfer 72 F-16 fighters to southern Italy
from Spain. NATO Commander Gen. John Galvin had personally
lobbied the House about Europe's weak southern flank, but Ms.
Schroeder said "there are no interesting targets left" in the
F-16s' range.
   Besides, she added, what is a congressperson to say "when
a constituent asks you, `Why did you vote to build a base in
Italy at the same time that the Defense Department is closing
Camp Swampy right here?'" Mr. Hussein seems unimpressed with
the Camp Swampy-as-deterrent strategy.
   Though Kuwaitis are suffering for it, in a perverse way
Saddam Hussein has done Americans a favor. He has reminded
Washington that history hasn't ended. Before his invasion,
the defense debate here had an abstract, almost surreal
quality. With the Soviets imploding, the rhetorical question
became, "Where's the threat?" The implicit answer was, there
isn't one. The Noriegas were thought little more than
small-time thugs. Think tanks and members of Congress
stumbled all over themselves to recommend which weapons to
cut and how fast. Anyone who raised doubts was a "cold
warrior."
   Saddam Hussein has rudely, but perhaps fortunately, given
everyone a look at the post-Cold War future. Amazing as it
sounds, American weapons and the occasional use of force will
still be required. Yesterday morning, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
the last serious Democratic hawk, was on TV saying that the
only way the U.S. could project force immediately into the
Gulf is with "long-range bombers." That sounds like the B-2
the House wants to kill.
   To be fair to Congress, the Bush administration has hardly
sounded the alarm about Iraq. U.S. policy before Iraqi troops
massed near Kuwait last week can be summed up as early
Carterism. The State Department resisted even mild
congressional sanctions. It continued government credits for
farm exports worth hundreds of millions of dollars. John
Kelly, State's Middle East man, told Congress only a few
weeks ago that sanctions would impair "our ability to
exercise a restraining influence on Iraqi actions." So much
for restraint.
   In one remarkable episode, only a last-minute tip to the
Pentagon prevented the sale to Iraq of state-of-the-art
furnaces. Made by a New Jersey company, the furnaces are
designed to burn high-purity metal of the sort used to make
parts for nuclear weapons, missiles and gas turbines. The
furnaces were on the dock ready to go; Commerce had approved
the purchase. After prodding by Florida Sen. Connie Mack and
defense officials, the White House blocked the sale.
   The White House appeasement is baffling, since Mr. Hussein
has advertised his belligerence for weeks, including to the
Journal's Karen House. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin
Powell did say recently that, "Iraq has more tanks" -- 5,500
-- "than Rommel, Montgomery and Eisenhower combined had
during the North African campaign." But even while trying to
protect his own defense budget, George Bush hasn't said a
word about Hussein.
   Iraq's invasion is the shape of things to come if the U.S.
withdraws as a military force in the post-Cold War era.
Regional powers, preeminent in their part of the world, will
attempt to dominate their weaker neighbors. India has already
done this on the Asian subcontinent, but no great U.S.
interests are at stake there. The Persian Gulf is different.
   As Soviet power has ebbed, a strange new alliance of
disarmers and isolationists has grown in influence in
Washington, uniting some conservatives and many liberals. One
symbol: The libertarian Cato Institute and left-wing
Institute for Policy Studies agree on defense policy. Their
shared view is that economic might is our main guarantee of
future security (though obviously for different reasons). The
U.S. should come home. The rest of the world (like Kuwait)
isn't our concern.
   By invading Kuwait, Saddam Hussein is showing that
economic interests indeed count, but not merely in the way
liberals and libertarians hope. In a world where a commodity
like oil is still defined by geography, bullies will exist
who will want to control it. In the future, these bullies
will, like Hussein, have nuclear and chemical weapons,
ballistic missiles and eventually space weapons too. We'd
better have enough military power to deter them.
