   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the post-Cold War era's first
global crisis, is a turning point in Middle East history and
a true challenge to the Bush administration.
   While the U.S. government cannot be blamed for Iraq's
aggression, America's too-soft, too-slow response to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's earlier threats must have made the
dictator think he could push further. Making this mistake the
first time was costly enough. A passive U.S. policy now will
encourage Iraq to occupy Kuwait permanently or even --
someday soon -- attack Saudi Arabia or Israel. Such a next
step could make direct U.S. involvement inescapable.

   One may cite here no less an expert than Iraq's deputy
foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon: "Aggressors thrive on
appeasement. The world learned that at tremendous cost from
the Munich agreement of 1938. . . . How could the German
generals oppose Hitler once he had proven himself successful?
Indeed, aggressors are usually clever at putting their
demands in a way that seems reasonable." The deputy foreign
minister was of course speaking in a different context. But
the message is clear.
   Fortunately, the U.S. has many options for dealing with
the crisis: threats, U.S.-regional cooperation, new
alliances, U.S.-Soviet collaboration and sanctions. But its
secret weapon is the fact that Mideast states, including
Iraq, tend to overrate American power. With the U.S. as the
world's only superpower, Saddam Hussein (like other Arab
leaders) expects Washington to do what he would in that
position: be aggressive and imperialistic. He should have
reason to fear American strength. It would be most dangerous
if, like the Iranians during the 1979-1981 hostage crisis, he
were to conclude that the U.S. is a paper tiger. Thus, the
first thing needed is tough talk.
   Next, the U.S. must reassess its regional alliances.
Egypt, Iraq's only probable rival for Arab leadership, must
know that it can rely on U.S. support in building an
anti-Saddam coalition. The recent tensions marking
U.S.-Israel relations must be discarded in the face of this
crisis. Last week the Bush administration was in the
ridiculous position of threatening to withhold $400 million
in housing credits to Israel while refusing to cut off $400
million in agricultural credits to Iraq. Any slackness in
U.S.-Israeli bilateral relations may give Iraq the impression
that it can get away with attacking Israel.
   The Kuwait crisis also affects the Arab-Israeli peace
process. Israel will be less inclined than ever to yield
territory in such an unstable situation. The Palestine
Liberation Organization has moved away from Egypt and toward
Iraq, and Yasser Arafat's migration from an alignment with
America's best Arab friend to its worst Arab enemy ought to
discourage the U.S. from reopening the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   One of the main questions is how the Gulf Arabs,
particularly Saudi Arabia, will react. Iraq has broken all
the rules of Middle East politics. Will the Gulf Arabs
continue their pattern of appeasing Saddam Hussein in public
and requesting U.S. protection in private, or will they ask
openly for U.S. assistance -- as they did during the
Iran-Iraq war? If the latter is the case, the U.S. will have
to decide how far it will go in sending them aid and military
forces.
   Another critical issue will be the U.S. attitude toward
Iraq's enemy neighbors, Iran and Syria. Both countries have
been radical and anti-American, supporting terrorism and
opposing U.S. policy. Faced with Iraq's aggression and their
own weaknesses (Syria has been crippled by losing its Soviet
ally), they may well want to improve relations with
Washington. Damascus has already begun to move in this
direction. There are many barriers, however, to ending these
enmities. Most of all, the Bush administration must remember
that the U.S. would be doing Syria and Iran a favor by
improving relations -- not the other way around. Syria and
Iran must change their behavior and help release American
hostages if they want U.S. help.
   Iraq's action also creates a prime opportunity for
U.S.-Soviet collaboration. Indeed, Secretary of State James
Baker plans to fly to Moscow to issue a joint statement
Friday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze about
the invasion. The Soviet Union (along with France) has been
Iraq's prime weapons supplier and (next to Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait) is among its largest creditors. Bilateral teamwork
can organize the international community for sanctions and
diplomatic pressure against Iraq.
   Sanctions, it is often said, never work. Yet their prime
importance here is not merely to inflict economic and
military costs on Baghdad but to send a signal to Saddam
Hussein. The freezing of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets in the U.S.
is a welcome first step. The absence of sanctions -- as
happened after Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Kurdish
civilians -- will prove aggression successful. Is the world
so craven that it will continue buying Kuwaiti oil pumped by
Iraqi occupiers?
   Given the large strategic oil reserves possessed by the
U.S. and other countries, the world can sustain an extended
embargo against Iraqi and Iraqi-exported Kuwaiti oil. It will
require cooperation from the two countries traversed by
Iraq's pipelines -- Saudi Arabia and Turkey -- for this
embargo to work, and they may refuse. The Saudis fear Iraqi
reprisal; the Turks are major trading partners of Iraq. But
the effort is worth making. Even if only partially effective,
this campaign would give Iraq another incentive to withdraw.
   Saddam Hussein likes the additional money from Kuwaiti oil
exports, but the invasion was not prompted by economic needs
alone. Iraq wants billions for reconstruction, yet it could
have obtained a big cash infusion merely by threatening
Kuwait. The principal factor here is Saddam Hussein's
determination to prove that Iraq is the most powerful state
in the Persian Gulf and the Arab world. For eight years Iraq
fought Iran, suffering hundreds of thousands of casualties to
determine who would dominate the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Iraq
won. It is now claiming the prize.
   Kuwait and Saudi Arabia gave Iraq an estimated $50 billion
to fight the war with Iran. But that was last year, and
Saddam Hussein is not known for being grateful. Similarly,
the U.S. helped him against Iran. But the day before the
invasion of Kuwait, Iraq demanded that U.S. naval forces be
withdrawn from the Persian Gulf.
   The methodology fits Saddam Hussein's self-image. He is
the type of ruler who deliberately spreads stories about his
toughness in order to frighten neighboring states. For
example, he likes people to think he personally executed foes
with his bare hands. He has invited foreign military attaches
to the border so they could observe the buildup of his army.
   The invasion of Kuwait is only the latest in a series of
steps the Iraqi leader has taken to make Iraq the most
powerful Arab nation in the Mideast. First, he ran a crash
program to obtain nuclear and chemical weapons. Second, he
threatened to destroy "half of Israel" if it attacked any
Arab state. Next, he nominated himself leader of an
anti-American alliance. Publicly, other Arab leaders cheered;
privately, they trembled.
   Now, however, Saddam Hussein has smashed the taboos of
pan-Arabism that governed the Arab world for four decades. He
is acting openly as an Iraqi nationalist, and he is
indifferent to whether he has any allies. This may prove a
costly mistake.
   After cooperating with Iraq to defend Gulf Arab states
from Iranian aggression in the 1980s, the U.S. must now help
to defend Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others in the 1990s from
Iraq. Otherwise the Iraqi leader may be able to dictate oil
production volumes and therefore prices, start wars and drive
U.S. interests out of the Gulf.
   The good news is that the world has been given another
chance. It is a new 1945, the end of a long global conflict
when victors and losers are ready to work together in peace.
This time, however, there is no Cold War to drag on the
suffering. If the U.S. takes leadership and organizes
international cooperation against Saddam Hussein, the new era
can be among the best in history. If the U.S. fails in this
task, historians will record Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as the
first in a series of international depredations and crises
that shook the 1990s.
