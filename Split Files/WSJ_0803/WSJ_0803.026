   SEATTLE -- After years as a mostly amateur sport, U.S.
track and field may be going pro.
   Unlike in Europe, where private clubs organize hugely
popular track meets and pay athletes large fees to compete,
U.S. track and field is dominated by an amateur governing
body that does very little to promote the sport commercially.
Though this has angered some U.S. athletes for years, they
have never before mustered the clout or sophistication to do
anything about it.

   Now, after a decade of battling the system, speedster Carl
Lewis and his manager, Joe Douglas, are mounting the most
serious challenge yet to the amateur ways of U.S. track and
field. Through the muscle of their Santa Monica Track Club --
part labor union, part talent agency, part revolutionary cell
-- Messrs. Lewis and Douglas are forcing U.S. amateur
officials to reckon with athletes as pros.
   The Santa Monica club's growing influence was particularly
evident here last week during the track and field events at
the Goodwill Games. In part because of the club's agitation,
The Athletics Congress, or TAC, the federation that controls
the sport in the U.S., paid members of the U.S. track team
from $3,000 to $23,000 -- depending on their world ranking --
to compete in the Goodwill meet. The arrangement, which drew
jealous complaints from swimmer Matt Biondi and other
competitors who didn't get paid for their appearances here,
ensured Santa Monica's participation and averted a likely
public-relations disaster for Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., sponsor of the games.
   But more important, the payments advanced the principle,
at a major U.S. "amateur" meet, of pay for participation.
   "For years, everyone has fought us because we've always
treated this sport as a professional business," says Mr.
Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist and the driving force
behind the Santa Monica club, founded by Mr. Douglas.
   Adds 23-year-old Leroy Burrell, the world's fastest
100-meter sprinter since 1988 and Mr. Lewis's close friend
and clubmate: "We're not in this sport because we like it or
we want to earn our way through school. We're in it to make
money. That's what this country is all about: Get a job and
make money."
   The Santa Monica club's power derives from its sheer
speed. Messrs. Lewis and Douglas have recruited a dazzling
array of sprinters to the club, many of them ranked among the
fastest in the world in their events. The assembled talent
gives the club the athletic and economic clout to back its
demands.
   For example, by keeping the club's premier runners out of
the U.S. National Championships last year, Mr. Douglas says
he made progress in negotiations with TAC on such issues as
prize money for races, grievance procedures, the right to
wear the Santa Monica uniform at international meets, and the
right to compete at certain meets without going through
qualifying steps. He also says TAC and Santa Monica have
agreed to work together to promote the sport, starting with
three to five meets in the U.S. next summer.
   Santa Monica is also trying to become a marketing power on
its own. Mr. Lewis designed the club's distinctive orange and
blue uniforms himself, testing their TV luster under a video
camera, he says. He's working on marketing the apparel.
   Santa Monica runners attend speech and acting classes to
enhance their marketability as commercial spokesmen. They
travel with a business manager, a lawyer and a travel
consultant. They often stay in downtown hotels, rather than
in athletes' dormitories, and they sometimes ride in
limousines to meets.
   "We're just a totally different baby from everybody else,"
Mr. Lewis says.
   Some of these differences irritate others connected to the
sport. Indeed, the flamboyant stance taken by the Santa
Monica athletes has driven a wedge through the ranks of track
and field. On one side are the free marketeers like Mr. Lewis
and his cohorts, who say athletes should be allowed to fetch
the highest possible price for their services.
   On the other side are the traditionalists who think that
even the marquee athletes bear a moral responsibility to help
the sport as a whole. They worry that if the amateur system
loses sway too quickly, what little financial support that
non-elite athletes receive from TAC and other amateur bodies
will dry up.
   "We have a lot of athletes who are still in this sport
because they love track and field -- not because of the
money," says Harvey Glance, a three-time Olympic sprinter and
chairman of the Athletes' Advisory Committee to TAC.
   Edwin Moses, the world-record holder in the 400-meter
hurdles and chairman of the Committee on Substance Abuse for
the U.S. Olympic Committee, puts it more bluntly. "Santa
Monica is interested in Santa Monica," he says. "I'm
interested in the sport as a whole. No one club, no one
person, is bigger than track and field."
   The hurdler, who is studying for a masters degree in
business administration while training for the 1992 Winter
Olympics as a bobsledder, wants TAC to hire a marketing and
publicity staff. He and others want it to reach out to clubs,
to schools, to networks, to advertisers. Ultimately, they
want TAC to promote track and field the way the National
Football League promotes football.
   "You're looking at a threshold philosophical question as
to what you want to be," says Ollan Cassell, executive
director of TAC and the man in the middle of the maelstrom.
He sees grave dangers in trying to use TAC as a marketing
arm. "Your duty is to carry out the rules and regulations {of
an amateur sport}. When you get into the promotional side of
it, you get into conflicts."
   Those conflicts were all too clear at the Goodwill meet.
On July 23, Turner Broadcasting equaled its highest
prime-time ratings of the event so far, a 3.6, when Messrs.
Burrell and Lewis squared off in the 100-meter dash. The
viewership surge inspired the network to invite the Santa
Monica Track Club's 4x100-meter relay team -- including both
speedsters from the 100-meter race, plus two other
world-class sprinters -- to run in the relay on July 26.
   But Mr. Cassell quashed the special invitation, on the
ground that the relays were meant for national teams, not
clubs. None of the Santa Monica sprinters, who prefer to run
as a team or not at all, competed in the event. Turner
Broadcasting's ratings fell to 2.7 that night.
   "How is it helping the sport not to let us run?" Mr. Lewis
asks.
   Says Svein Romstad, Turner Broadcasting's director of
sports relations: "It's very frustrating to sit on the
sidelines and let the national governing bodies handle the
negotiations with athletes."
