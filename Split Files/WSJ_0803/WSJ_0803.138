   Midland Bank PLC posted pretax profit for the six months
ended June 30 of #36 million ($66.8 million); profit was
weaker than expected, although it reversed a year-earlier
loss of #531 million.
   Midland, a major British commercial bank, was expected to
post pretax profit somewhere between #150 million and #203
million.

<TEXT>
   Pretax profit was curbed by #300 million in loan
provisions, #234 million of which was to cover exposure in
the U.K. market. It had only #90 million in provisions in the
year-earlier period to cover domestic loans.
   Midland's profit was also cut by a #38 million charge
against interest-rate swaps with U.K. municipalities that
have been voided by the British courts.
   Pretax profit before provisions, however, fell in the
latest half to #363 million, down 19% from #449 million.
   The bank said profitability was also hurt by narrower U.K.
interest margins, reduced interest payments by Third World
debtors and the continued effects of its misjudging the
direction of U.K. interest rates last year.
