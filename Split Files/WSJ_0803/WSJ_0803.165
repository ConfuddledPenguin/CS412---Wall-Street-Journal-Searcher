   NEW YORK -- The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
plans to name Stanley Brezenoff, a former New York City
deputy mayor, as its next executive director.
   The Port Authority said Mr. Brezenoff is subject to
approval by the bi-state agency's 12 commissioners, who may
consider his appointment at their next scheduled public
meeting Thursday. He would succeed Stephen Berger, who
resigned last month after five years as Port Authority
executive director. Mr. Brezenoff, 52 years old, currently
senior program adviser at the Commonwealth Fund, a New
York-based health care foundation, declined to comment until
the commissioners consider his nomination.

   Local transportation officials said Mr. Brezenoff earned a
reputation for consensus building as first deputy mayor in
the Koch administration. Previously, he was president of the
city's Health and Hospitals Corp. and a program officer at
the Ford Foundation. He is a "skillful diplomat who knows the
transportation field," said Robert Kiley, chairman of New
York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, on whose board
Mr. Brezenoff has served since 1985.
   Mr. Brezenoff, if approved for the $170,000-a-year job,
would face many challenges. He must secure desperately needed
funds to continue the big modernization of the Port
Authority's airports, river crossings, rail facilities and
cargo docks started by Mr. Berger.
   The rebuilding program lately has been stalled by the
slowdown in New York's regional economy and the Port
Authority's failure last year to win approval for a boost in
trans-Hudson bridge and tunnel tolls and rail fares. Critics
blamed the defeat on Mr. Berger's decision to announce plans
for the increases without first securing support from the
governors of New York and New Jersey.
