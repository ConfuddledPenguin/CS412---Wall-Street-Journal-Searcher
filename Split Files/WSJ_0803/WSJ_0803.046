   WASHINGTON -- The China National Aero-Technology Import
and Export Corp. said it agreed to sell Mamco Manufacturing
Inc. to comply with an order by President Bush, who required
the action on grounds of national security.

   The Chinese company said the ownership of Seattle-based
Mamco, which makes aircraft parts for U.S. commercial
aircraft manufacturers, will be transferred to DeCrane
Aircraft Holdings Inc., a private Midwest firm. The price
wasn't disclosed.
   U.S. trade law allows the president to suspend or prohibit
the acquisition of a U.S. company by a foreign party if he
finds they are contrary to national security interests. The
decision to force Catic to sell its stake in Mamco was the
first time President Bush rejected an acquisition on such
grounds.
   Initially, Catic was ordered to dispose of its stock in
Mamco, acquired in November 1989, within three months of Feb.
1. This deadline was subsequently extended for another three
months.
   U.S. officials said Catic, an export-import company of
China's Ministry of Aerospace Industry, has business dealings
with various U.S. companies, including commercial aircraft
manufacturers. The Chinese government ministry engages in
aerospace research and development and is responsible for the
design and production of military and commercial aircraft and
missiles in China.
