   News of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent the Tokyo stock
market into a tailspin Thursday. The Nikkei index of 225
issues, which was off 197.67 points Wednesday, fell 592.81 to
30245.18, the market's sixth decline in the past seven
sessions.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index continued its decline
and ended the morning session at 29953.47, down 291.71
points. Earlier, it had been off more than 500 points.

   Fallout from the Mideast situation blanketed the world's
stock markets, most of which posted steep declines because of
concerns about the potential economic effects. London share
prices finished a dismal session sharply lower and at the
day's minimums, on the heels of Iraq's invasion and the
accompanying repercussions from higher global oil prices.
   At one point in Tokyo, the benchmark index plunged below
the 30000 mark, as the currency and bond markets also
weakened, but stocks recovered as selling was absorbed.
Program buying linked to indexes helped prices rebound
moderately from intraday lows. Trading volume was light, with
about 400 million shares changing hands in the first section,
down from 439.9 million shares on Wednesday. The Tokyo Stock
Price Index, or Topix, of all first section issues, which
fell 5.88 points Wednesday, dropped 31.25 to 2215.43. The
second section index, which added 13.93 points a day earlier,
rose 8.13 to 4444.39, on volume estimated at 37.74 million
shares, up from 37.216 million shares Wednesday.
   Analysts said the decline was prompted by worries that the
conflict in the Middle East might lead to steep increases in
the price of crude oil, which in turn could raise costs for
Japanese manufacturers. Japan relies on imports for roughly
two-thirds of its energy needs and is the world's largest
importer of crude oil. Only 6.6% of Japan's oil imports come
from Kuwait, but the fear among investors in Japan is that by
taking control of Kuwait, Iraq will be in a stronger position
to persuade other oil-producing nations to raise their
prices. The dollar's rise on the yen, sparked by safe-haven
buying as an inflation hedge on the Iraq-Kuwait news, also
swayed stock market sentiment, traders said.
   To forestall the threat to the market of the possibility
that higher oil prices could translate into inflation,
analysts said, the Bank of Japan might raise interest rates.
Most analysts attributed the poor performance of the Tokyo
exchange in recent weeks to investor fears that central bank
officials might make good on hints about another increase in
the discount rate, the interest rate that the central bank
charges on loans to financial institutions. Before news
reports of the Iraqi incursion, many observers believed the
stock market had declined enough to discount the potential
effect of a rate change. Now they aren't so sure.
   "If you'd asked me yesterday if this market could slip to
its April low, I'd have told you definitely not," James
Vestal, an economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Co., said.
"It's difficult to see why the market should sell itself off
in the absence of some sort of external shock. But now we'll
have to wait and see."
   "Basically, everything is pointing in the direction of
higher interest rates," Russell Jones, an analyst with
UBS-Phillips and Drew International Ltd., a British
securities concern, said. "If crude oil reaches $25 a barrel,
its very hard to see how the Bank of Japan can avoid putting
the {discount rate} up again."
   The dreary outlook is further clouded by concerns that the
Iraqi incursion may result in a withdrawal of Kuwaiti
investments from the Tokyo market. One of the world's largest
investors, the Kuwaiti government has more than $100 billion
invested overseas, about $8 billion of this in Japan,
according to the Japan-Kuwait Friendship Society.
   Morihiko Iida, a senior strategist at Morgan Stanley
Investment Trust Co., believes the Tokyo market will shake
off jitters about oil prices and rebound within two or three
weeks. He said the market's afternoon rally demonstrates its
resilience.
   Peter Tasker, a strategist at Kleinwort Benson Co., a
British securities company, wasn't so upbeat. "You'd have to
be very, very optimistic to come and buy in this market now,"
he said. "I see no indication that the downtrend is
finished."
   Trading volume has been off nearly two-thirds since the
Tokyo market plunged nearly 28% in the first quarter, and
news of the Iraqi move helped keep Japan's already sluggish
investors out of the market. "With all the other negatives
around, investors are saying, `Here's even more reason to sit
on your hands,'" Stuart Matthews, an analyst with Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd., a British brokerage
house, said. "There's a lot of uncertainty and a lot of
risk."
   The risk of higher energy prices has a strong
psychological effect on Japanese investors, analysts said,
because of the national trauma stirred by oil crises in the
1970s. Sharp increases in crude oil prices in 1973 and 1974
triggered severe inflation in Japan and forced Japanese
companies to restructure their manufacturing operations
significantly.
   Teikoku Oil rose 60 yen to 1,360 yen ($9.24), Nippon Oil
rose 40 to 1,430 and Mitsubishi Oil was unchanged at 1,320.
   Interest was strong in high-priced blue chips, led by
gains in Nintendo, which ended at 31,200, up 1,800. Nippon
Telegraph &amp; Telephone rose 20,000 to 1.06 million.
Seven-Eleven rose 90 to 8,790.
   Nippon Mining rose 27 to 919, Mitsubishi Mining was up 4
at 735, Mitsubishi Metal advanced 19 to 880, and Sumitomo
Mining added 10 to 1,560. Asahi Diamond closed at 3,000, up
10.
   Domestic stocks sensitive to interest rates, particularly
shipbuilding, construction and steel, were much lower.
Ohbayashi Corp. lost 30 to 1,500, Nippon Hodo fell 100 to
3,580, Maeda Construction was down 70 at 2,010, and Kajima
fell 30 to 1,690. Taisei Corp. fell 40 to 1,160, and Shimizu
Corp. sank 40 to 1,840. Nisshin Steel fell 13 to 805,
Kawasaki Steel was down 9 at 509, and Daido Steel fell 8 to
870.
   In London, excluding the oil sector, stocks were knocked
broadly lower, as the market interpreted the events in the
Persian Gulf to mean that higher oil prices would boost
Britain's inflation rate, now 9.8%, and keep British base
interest rates at least at current 15% levels. Wall Street's
sharp decline also was a drag on the London market,
commentators said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell
34.5 points to 2304.5, which also was the intraday low and
well below the opening peak of 2347.9. Volume was a brisk
561.5 million shares, compared with 419.2 million shares a
day earlier, though 77 million shares of Thursday's total
were traded in British Petroleum alone. The Financial Times
30-share index lost 41.4 to 1811.4.
   While the prospect of higher oil prices helps correct the
balance-of-payments shortfall in Britain, Paul Harrison, a
vice president at Salomon Brothers International in London,
said it "does little to alleviate the pressure on inflation."
Moreover, the government has said evidence of lower inflation
is needed before the pound enters the exchange-rate mechanism
of the European Monetary System, which now could be delayed,
he said.
   But market watchers generally said they didn't see any
panic selling during the session. The major performer was
British Petroleum, which advanced 21 pence to 361 pence
($6.70). BP shares were viewed as most vulnerable to any
supply disruptions in the Middle East. Kuwait's investment
arm owns a 9.9% stake in BP.
   Shell Transport &amp; Trading added 13 to 496, on robust
volume of 14 million shares. Enterprise Oil rose 8 to 676,
Ultramar gained 7 to 349, and Lasmo advanced 17 to 461.
   Sectors sensitive to interest rates were severely
disrupted, with building and property issues hit hardest.
Land Securities shed 17 to 513, British Land skidded 16 to
292, Tarmac dropped 10 to 260, Hammerson lost 14 to 685, and
Trafalgar House retreated 12 to 283.
   British Aerospace rose 5 to 564, because of the increased
tension in the Mideast. The company supplies arms to the
region and is the main contractor for the Al Yamamah
agreements with Saudi Arabia.
   Elsewhere, stock prices retreated broadly in Paris,
Frankfurt, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid, slid on thin trading
in Zurich, and tumbled across the board in Amsterdam, all on
worries about the Iraqi military action's effect on oil
prices, inflation and interest rates. Brussels prices fell,
though most oil stocks there fared well on the Kuwaiti news.
South African gold stocks closed sharply higher.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney and Manila, and lower
in Taipei, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Wellington. The
Sydney stock market surged after the government unexpectedly
eased domestic interest rates, and the Mideast news helped
propel gold and oil shares. Stocks plummeted in Hong Kong and
fell sharply in Singapore and Taipei on the invasion report.
Manila equities were buoyed by speculation that gold will
rise, because of the Iraqi move. Wellington prices fell
sharply in continuing fallout from Wednesday's jump in
domestic interest rates.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
