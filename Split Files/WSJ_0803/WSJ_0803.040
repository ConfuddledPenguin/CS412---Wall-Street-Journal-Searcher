   An American soldier's theft of German church treasures at
the end of World War II began to surface this April. The New
York Times reported that a government-funded German
foundation had paid a $3 million "finder's fee" for the
Quedlinburg Gospels, a magnificent illuminated Carolingian
manuscript written in gold. The seller reportedly had
threatened the manuscript would be sold to a Japanese buyer.
John S. Torigian, a Dallas attorney acting for anonymous
clients, had arranged the transfer in Switzerland through
Heribert Tenschert, a Bavarian dealer in rare books and
manuscripts. Reaction to the sale was mixed. While pleased
that the Gospels might return to their home when
reunification takes place, many were incensed at the
extortion and disturbed by the secrecy of the seller's
identity.
   The Gospels and other medieval works of art from the
Quedlinburg cloister's treasury were stored for safety in a
mine shaft outside Quedlinburg in 1945 when American troops
approached. The U.S. Army knew treasures were missing, but by
1949, Quedlinburg was part of the Russian zone and later East
Germany, and the Army dropped its investigation.

   Among medievalists, the disappearance of the Quedlinburg
treasures was considered a major war loss. The convent had
especially beautiful things, 10th- and 11th-century gifts
from the Ottonian imperial family. The medieval works from
Quedlinburg now in Texas include a silver reliquary with
enamel plaques and carved ivory panels, a small group of rock
crystal vessels, crucifixes of gold and silver, and a carved
ivory comb.
   Shortly after the sale of the Gospels, Willi Korte of
Berlin's Prussian Cultural Heritage administration traveled
to the U.S. and followed a trail to the town of Whitewright
in northeast Texas, and to its bank, where heirs of Lt. Joe
T. Meador, who served in the unit that occupied Quedlinburg,
had deposited the treasures as collateral for a loan. Meador
apparently stole more than 10 works from the Quedlinburg
treasury. Witnesses who served with Meador have come forward
to tell of the theft from the mine shaft. Meador died of
cancer in 1980.
   The Church of Quedlinburg has brought suit in Federal
District Court in Dallas to recover the items, and the West
German government will foot the legal bill. A restraining
order will keep the treasure safe until its ownership is
determined. Meador's sister and brother are defendants and,
along with Mr. Torigian, subjects of a criminal investigation
seeking to discover whether they knew the objects were stolen
before transporting the manuscript to Switzerland for sale.
It later was reported that the IRS also is looking into their
possible tax liability, putting additional pressure on Jane
Meador Cook and Jack Meador to settle this deeply
embarrassing situation.

   In mid-July, Judge Vincent L. Broderick denied the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's motion to dismiss a 1987 lawsuit
filed by the Republic of Turkey to recover more than 200
ancient silver and gold artifacts that Turkey calls the
Lydian Hoard and the Met labels "East Greek." Turkey claims
the objects were plundered from a burial mound in Ushak and
smuggled out for sale. Although almost 20 years had passed
since the Met acquired the objects through purchases totaling
more than $1 million and through gifts from the two dealers
who made the sale, the court ruled that the museum could not
use the statute of limitations defense. Turkey's assertion
that the Met was not a good-faith purchaser needed to be
tested, the court ruled, adding that the museum may have been
aware of the artifacts' illicit export and may have
deliberately concealed their acquisition. The ruling cleared
the way to trial.

   Van Gogh's centenary exhibition in Amsterdam just closed
after drawing 1.2 million visitors, who admired, among other
paintings, three van Goghs from the Kroller-Muller Museum
recovered by Dutch police earlier this year. Meanwhile,
however, the Noord Brabant Museum in nearby s'Hertogenbosch
suffered the theft of three paintings from the artist's early
years in Nuenen. On the night of June 27, a window was
broken, the alarm system failed, and in the morning the
museum discovered it was missing works it values between $2.7
and $5.4 million.

   On July 4, Paris lost three paintings from three museums.
A small Renoir portrait of a woman, on display near a
staircase in the Louvre's Pavilion des Flores, was cut from
its frame during museum hours. About an hour later, the theft
of Ernest Hebert's portrait of "Monaluccia" was discovered at
the Musee Hebert, a small museum on the Left Bank. It too was
cut from its stretcher without tripping the alarm attached to
the frame. A third picture, a landscape of 1816 by Paul Huet,
was discovered missing from the museum of the city of Paris,
the Musee Carnavalet.
   Reaction was swift. The next day Jacques Sallois, the
director of the national museums, announced an unusual
decision: Five small museums in Paris would close until
further notice. In addition to the Musee Hebert, the Gustave
Moreau, Eugene Delacroix, Ennery, and Jean-Jacques Henner
museums will admit visitors only in pre-arranged groups and
for lectures. These museums were the homes or studios of the
artists, and the security staff in each could only be
described as minimal. Increased security was announced for
three of the capital's most popular tourist attractions, the
Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, and the Palace of Versailles.

   Print dealers in the Los Angeles area are relieved that
the Doremus twins, Paul Drake and Kevin, are in police
custody. The brothers allegedly worked together, one
distracting gallery staff while the other took prints, then
rolled or folded them, before the two left the gallery. The
"system" then required a visit to a paper conservator to
repair the damage and to alter the edition numbers. Once
framed, the stolen prints were consigned for auction.
Cooperation among victims, specialists at Butterfield's
auction house and Detective William Martin of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Art Theft Detail resulted in the arrests
and several felony counts for the brothers.
