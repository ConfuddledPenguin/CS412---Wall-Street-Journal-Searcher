   NATICK, Mass. -- Prime Computer Inc.'s share of an Army
computer contract is expected to amount to more than $100
million, the largest in the company's history, industry
sources say.
   The $700 million, multiyear contract was awarded Friday to
Electronic Data Systems Corp., a General Motors Corp. unit.
Spokesmen for both companies refused to disclose how much of
that contract would go to Prime.

   The contract calls for EDS to provide up to 20,000
computers and systems for general office use by the Army,
Navy and defense logistics agency by 1995. A spokeswoman for
the Army's information systems procurement agency confirmed
that Prime's machines will be "the heart of the system." But
she wouldn't break out the company's potential share.
   The subcontract appears to be a major win for Prime, which
has been struggling to cut costs and reverse huge losses it
suffered in the wake of a hostile takeover attempt. Prime was
taken private in 1989 by a unit of D.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New
York investment firm.
