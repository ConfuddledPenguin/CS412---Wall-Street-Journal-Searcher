   WASHINGTON -- President Bush's economic retaliation for
the invasion of Kuwait isn't likely to hurt Iraq much.
   Mr. Bush issued two executive orders early yesterday, one
imposing an asset freeze and trade embargo against Iraq, the
other blocking transfers of official Kuwaiti assets in the
U.S. to shield them from Iraqi takeover.

   The combination of sanctions against Iraq is the most
severe economic penalty the U.S. can impose against a nation.
The order severs all transportation and financial links
between the two countries and bars U.S. citizens from working
in Iraq. But unlike the similar sanctions the U.S. placed on
Iran in 1979 during the hostage crisis, the moves against
Iraq aren't expected to have much impact on the Arab nation.
   A Commerce Department official said there is a "limited"
U.S. business presence in Iraq. He estimated there are less
than 100 Americans working there now, mainly as technicians
and engineers.
   Also, U.S. officials say that Iraq has only minimal assets
in the U.S., and U.S. companies export only about $1.2
billion in goods -- mostly farm products -- to Iraq. Iraq can
quickly make up for the $2.3 billion in oil it ships to the
U.S. from the price increases it will cause by taking over
Kuwait's oil fields.
   In the U.S., banks acted quickly on the president's
orders. The manager of international money transfer at a
major New York bank said that by 6 a.m. yesterday, his bank,
and presumably other big U.S. banks, had shut down the
transfers of Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets.
   Handling the freeze against Iraq won't be a problem
because of the country's small holdings in the U.S. Thomas
Sams, who runs the Iraq desk at the Commerce Department,
called Baghdad's holdings here "minuscule."
   But dealing with Kuwait's huge assets could be more
complicated, because they are divided between official, or
government holdings, which are blocked, and private assets,
which aren't covered by the president's order. U.S. officials
say they don't know how big Kuwait's U.S. holdings are.
According to the Commerce Department's tabulation of holdings
in real estate and major corporate shares, Kuwait's direct
investment in the U.S. totaled $4.2 billion last year.
   But officials estimate that private and official Kuwaiti
"portfolio" investment in stocks and bonds could amount to an
additional $35 billion to $55 billion, for total U.S.
holdings of about $40 billion to $60 billion. However, some
private analysts estimate that the holdings are far smaller.
Sharif Ghalib at the Institute for International Finance, for
example, says his calculations show total Kuwaiti assets of
$15 billion in the U.S.
   Michael Bradfield, an attorney in the Washington office of
Jones Day Reavis &amp; Pogue who specializes in banking, says
that "sorting out what's public and what's private in a place
like Kuwait is extremely difficult. It will put judgmental
burdens on banks that they certainly would rather not have.
The Kuwaitis have assets all over the place and sorting all
that out is going to be a long-term problem, assuming the
situation remains as it is."
   The Kuwaiti Investment Office, the financial arm of the
government, has major stockholdings in a number of companies,
including British Petroleum Co. In addition, private Kuwaiti
investors have broad interests in real estate, retailing and
other U.S. assets.
   Santa Fe International Corp., Alhambra, Calif., a
petroleum concern acquired by the Kuwaitis in 1981 for $2.5
billion, said it continues normal business operations.
   John J. Mika, vice president administration, said in an
interview that communications with the State and Treasury
departments indicate that "the freeze isn't intended to be
punitive to companies such as Santa Fe International." Mr.
Mika said the company, with about 2,000 employees world-wide,
issued its normal payroll yesterday.
   Commercial relations between the U.S. and Iraq have been
relatively slow to develop, aside from oil purchases and
annual shipments of about $1 billion of rice, wheat, corn and
soybean products to Iraq. Washington and Baghdad didn't have
full relations until 1984, and then Iraq's bitter war with
Iran limited commercial opportunity. After the war ended two
years ago, U.S. interest began to pick up. General Motors
Corp. negotiated to assemble cars in Iraq, and construction,
irrigation and other companies began to look for business
there.
   The sanctions will end about $200 million in short-term
Export-Import Bank insurance for shipments of U.S.
manufactured goods, and agricultural credits that have ranged
from $500 million to $1 billion a year recently. But
yesterday, Iraq announced that it was suspending repayments
on $2.2 billion of credits it owes the U.S.
   Yesterday the House voted 416-0 to authorize an embargo on
virtually all trade with Iraq and to impose new sanctions,
including tighter standards on the export of manufactured
goods and technology to Baghdad. The bill goes beyond the
administration in some areas and would give Congress greater
leverage in reviewing any future decision by Mr. Bush to lift
the restrictions.
