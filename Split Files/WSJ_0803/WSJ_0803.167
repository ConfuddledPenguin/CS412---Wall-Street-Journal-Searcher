   WASHINGTON -- A compromise designed to resolve the
regulatory dispute over commodities regulation could be
facing trouble after a key senator said he was considering
backing away from the accord.
   The compromise agreement, aimed at settling a squabble
over stock-index futures regulation, has gotten "bogged down"
as staff members try to work out the details of the plan,
said Sen. Christopher Bond, who has been a catalyst of the
compromise.

   The Missouri Republican said that if details of the
compromise can't be reached among Senate aides drafting the
legislation, he would withdraw his support for the agreement
and back the original proposal put forth by the Bush
administration. That plan would shift regulatory authority
for stock-index futures to the Securities and Exchange
Commission from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   As currently discussed, the compromise would leave
stock-index futures oversight with the CFTC but grant
authority to the Federal Reserve Board for stock-index
futures margins, the good-faith money needed to trade the
product. Margins have become a key issue because they
determine the amount of leverage traders can use.
   "I would prefer the compromise," Sen. Bond said. "But if
we continue to bog down in the specifics, we'll have to go
back to the original proposal. We have to do something." Sen.
Bond said he probably would make his decision when the Senate
returns from its recess after Labor Day.
   Stock-index futures allow investors to bet on the movement
of a basket of stocks without buying the actual shares. They
often are cited as pushing around the stock and options
markets, which are regulated by the SEC.
