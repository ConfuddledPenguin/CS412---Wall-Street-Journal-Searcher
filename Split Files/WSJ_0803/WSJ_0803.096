   J.P. Bolduc, who has played a major role in restructuring
the varied business lines of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., was named
president and chief operating officer at the diversified
chemical concern.
   Mr. Bolduc, 51 years old, has been one of the three vice
chairmen at Grace whom Chief Executive Officer J. Peter Grace
has been considering as possible successors. Mr. Bolduc thus
appears to have won an edge, though Mr. Grace, 77, gave no
indication that he's preparing to step down.

   Mr. Bolduc, who joined Grace in 1983, succeeds Charles H.
Erhart Jr., who is retiring as president and will remain a
director. Mr. Erhart, 65, was elected president last year,
but he wasn't considered a potential successor to Mr. Grace.
   Mr. Bolduc has been deeply involved in the company's
restructuring efforts and recently has been responsible for
the company's business groups outside its core specialty
chemicals segment. Although the restructuring has already
resulted in asset sales totaling some $2.3 billion since
1986, still more changes are widely expected.
   "We're looking for continued restructuring at Grace. J.P.
Bolduc has been the quarterback in that," said Mark R.
Gulley, a chemical-industry analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   In an interview, Mr. Bolduc said his role in those efforts
will expand. He didn't disclose which of the company's
businesses -- which range from fireproofing materials to
kidney dialysis to artificial insemination of dairy herds --
may be affected. But he said the company is no longer
limiting the possibilities to businesses outside its
specialty chemicals stronghold.
   Mr. Bolduc also emphasized that Grace will consider not
only sales but spinoffs to shareholders, public offerings,
partnerships and joint ventures. The company, in fact, has
already started along that route, having sold 17% of its oil
and coal operations to the public last year.
   He disclosed that Grace last year rejected an offer from
an unidentified bidder for its entire specialty businesses
group, whose interests include cocoa products, book
distribution and textiles, and whose total sales in 1989 were
$1.69 billion. Grace had sales of $6.11 billion last year.
   He explained that Grace had doubts about the offer, partly
because at about the same time Grace was selling a single
industrial-equipment rental business for what it considered a
high price, $305 million, or 25 times the 1988 earnings of
the business. The buyer was Compagnie Francaise de l'Afrique
Occidentale, Paris. That led Grace to think it wouldn't get a
premium for its specialty businesses if it sold them as a
group rather than selling or otherwise restructuring them
separately.
   "It became obvious that while we could have sold the
businesses at a good price and for a good gain, we'd be
better off if we handled it differently," he said.
   How well Grace fares in additional restructuring will
doubtless figure in whether Mr. Bolduc ultimately succeeds
Mr. Grace, who has held the top post at the company since
1945. Mr. Grace himself said the board didn't say anything
about any succession issues while electing Mr. Buldoc as
president. But Mr. Grace, the company's chairman, added,
"It's a good move up."
