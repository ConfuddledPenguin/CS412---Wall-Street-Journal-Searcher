   WASHINGTON -- A housing-rights group sued the government's
savings-and-loan bailout agency, contending that the agency
isn't adhering to procedures to promote low-income housing.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleged that
the Resolution Trust Corp. isn't sufficiently publicizing
homes made available when it sells off the assets of sick
thrifts, hasn't appointed certain groups as "clearinghouses"
for the real estate information, and is restricting the flow
of houses into the program.

   ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for
Reform Now, said it is seeking a preliminary injunction to
award ACORN funds for homes that were sold "improperly" and
to appoint ACORN as a clearinghouse for the information.
   The savings and loan cleanup law called for public housing
agencies and those with low incomes to have a 90-day first
look at homes and apartments appraised at below-average
prices.
   A spokesman for the RTC said the agency hadn't yet seen
the suit and couldn't comment in detail. But he said that
ACORN hadn't yet officially requested to be designated a
clearinghouse for the information and that the RTC had made
catalogs of the property available to ACORN. "We're sorry
they're unhappy," he said.
