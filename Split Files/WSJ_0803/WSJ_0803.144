   WASHINGTON -- Seizing on the turmoil in the Middle East to
buttress their arguments, supporters of the B-2 Stealth
bomber won a narrow victory on the Senate floor to keep the
embattled plane alive.
   By defeating a pair of amendments to end or delay
production of additional radar-eluding B-2s, the Senate set
the stage for a historic test of wills with the House over
the kind of military forces the U.S. needs to cope with
Soviet nuclear threats and Third World crises in the late
1990s and beyond. The margin of victory was eight votes or
fewer in both instances.

   In spite of the fact that saving the B-2 remains President
Bush's highest military priority, the House is almost certain
to reject additional purchases of the bat-shaped bomber when
it approves its version of the defense authorization bill in
September.
   Reflecting sharp erosion of bipartisan support even in the
Senate, lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to withhold any more
production funds until the Air Force and Northrop Corp., the
prime contractor on the B-2, present convincing new test
results showing that its performance in the air has matched
its billing.
   "This horse is heavy enough already," said Sen. Sam Nunn
(D., Ga.), adding that significant further delays will make
it "very, very difficult to ever sell it to the American
people."
   Still, yesterday's dramatic series of votes was a victory
for both President Bush and Sen. Nunn, chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. Sen. Nunn staked his reputation as the
Senate's leading voice on defense matters on the outcome of
the B-2 battle. Last year, only 29 senators voted to cut off
B-2 production. This time, 43 senators voted to halt
purchases and begin closing down the assembly line, while 56
opposed the amendment.
   Acknowledging that "the popular decision in the United
States today {would be} to cancel the B-2," Sen. James Exon
(D., Neb.), another outspoken supporter, urged the Senate to
salvage the "quantum leap forward" in technology.
   The lengthy debate originally was expected to focus on
arms-control issues, the B-2s huge price of more than $850
million a plane, and disputes about Soviet military
capabilities and intentions. Instead, Iraq's bloody invasion
of Kuwait altered the tone of the entire debate. Supporters
of the B-2, who clearly had been on the defensive before,
gained momentum and fresh ammunition by attacking Iraq's
moves and pointing out the B-2's capabilities to respond to
such an emergency.
   The unexpected Iraqi attack "reminded {lawmakers} there is
a lot of mischief in the world," Senate Minority Leader
Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said. "We ought to err on the side of
being prepared."
   Almost every lawmaker who joined in the debate -- from
staunch supporters of the B-2 to newly converted opponents
such as Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) -- tried to capitalize on
the Middle Eastern development to help make their case. Sen.
Glenn, a former astronaut and advocate of new aviation
technology, took the Senate floor to announce that after
weeks of "agonizing" he concluded that the B-2 would siphon
off badly needed funds from conventional weapons and military
personnel accounts. The Air Force, he said, simply hasn't
"been willing to address that {issue} head on," adding that
the B-2 "isn't what we need to go against the situation in
the Persian Gulf."
   All told, the Senate approved almost $2 billion for
procurement of two more B-2 bombers and at least that much
for continued research and testing during the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1. The Pentagon has spent about $27 billion for
15 planes already authorized or currently being built. The
total price is expected to be well over $65 billion if the
fleet of 75 B-2s proposed by the White House is built. Barely
a few months ago, the Pentagon insisted it needed 132 of the
planes to fulfill its nuclear-deterrent mission.
   In his spirited defense of the plane, Sen. Nunn argued
that terminating production would send U.S. arms-control
negotiators "back to the drawing board" and leave the U.S.
vulnerable to continued improvements in the Soviet's nuclear
arsenal. "All of us are suffering from sticker shock" with
the B-2, he acknowledged. But if Soviet advances eventually
force the U.S. to begin investing in a new network of
super-sophisticated air defenses, he said, "it will make the
. . . B-2 look like the biggest bargain we ever killed."
   The anti-B-2 amendment that garnered the most
votes-introduced by Sens. William Cohen (R., Maine) and
Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) -- sought to withhold all new
production money until at least 1992, pending the outcome of
flight tests. "The biggest stealth characteristic of this
plane has been its mission," Sen. Leahy asserted, adding:
"Unfortunately, it's not stealth dollars." The amendment
failed on a 53-45 vote.
   B-2 supporters insisted that a one-year disruption in
production could be tantamount to killing the entire program,
by adding $4.7 billion to the already skyrocketing cost of
the B-2 and prompting layoffs of some assembly-line workers.
   In a speech to the Aspen Institute in Colorado, President
Bush echoed that sentiment. "To maintain clear and confident
strategic deterrence into the next century, we need the B-2.
. . . further delay will only increase cost." The president
also urged Congress to fund continued development of the
Midgetman and mobile MX missiles.
   Working late into the evening, the Senate also defeated an
amendment that would bar construction of an airbase in
Crotone, Italy.
