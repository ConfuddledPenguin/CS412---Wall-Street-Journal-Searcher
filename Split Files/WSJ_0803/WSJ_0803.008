   The National Transportation Safety Board is recommending
an inspection of fuel-switch wiring on all Boeing Co.
737-300, -400 and -500 jetliners in the wake of a May
explosion aboard a Philippine Air Lines jet that killed eight
people.
   Safety officials say they think the explosion in the
plane's center fuel tank may have been caused by defects in a
"float switch," which is used in fueling the plane, and
faulty wiring to the switch. The blast occurred as the
late-model Boeing 737-300 prepared for takeoff from Manila
with 119 on board. A bomb was initially suspected as the
cause, but the safety board said its investigation found "no
evidence of a bomb, an incendiary device, or sabotage."

   Boeing, based in Seattle, said it "doesn't believe that
sufficient evidence exists to call for any fleetwide
inspections of 737 components or the wiring." Such a
directive would mean inspection of some 750 planes.
   The safety board's recommendation is being considered by
the Federal Aviation Administration. "We have not decided
what means and on what schedule to implement" the safety
board's recommendations, said Anthony J. Broderick, associate
administrator for regulation and certification for the FAA.
Part of the problem is that a fleetwide inspection of the
switches and wiring would require "development of procedures
and tests which don't yet exist," he said.
   In addition to recommending inspections of the wiring on
the 737 fleet, the safety board asked that tests be developed
to ensure that the float switches "are free from defect that
could cause an explosion or fire."
   "From a technical point of view, we are looking to see if
there is a way of testing" the float switches, said Ronald A.
Buchanan, president of Revere Aerospace Inc., a Dobson Park
Industries PLC division that makes the devices. As for the
safety board's suggestions of problems with the float switch,
he said: "There were no defects in the switch."
   The safety board concedes that its investigation, being
conducted in conjunction with the Philippine government, "has
yet to reveal the exact ignition source." Other
possibilities, the board said, include the airline's
installation of additional wiring near the fuel tanks for
wing lights, which could have led to damage that caused the
explosion, or defects in a fuel pump. Mr. Broderick said the
FAA is already working with Boeing to test the fuel pump
system.
   The possibility of an inspection of the twin-engine 737s
for wiring defects once again brings up the specter of
quality problems that have plagued Boeing in recent years. In
May, the FAA ordered airlines to inspect pilot controls on
737-300s, -400s and -500s after a missing cotter pin caused a
control wheel to come off in a co-pilot's hand. Last year,
after flaws were discovered in fire-extinguisher systems in
the engines and cargo bays of some aircraft, a world-wide
inspection resulted in reports of 94 separate instances of
defects, on almost every Boeing model. Boeing has said it has
taken steps to improve production-line quality, including
redesigning the fire-extinguisher wiring.
