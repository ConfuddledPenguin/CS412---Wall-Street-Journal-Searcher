   MILAN -- Banca Nazionale del Lavoro today declined to say
if it was considering action with respect to the $2.7 billion
it is owed by Iraq.
   A spokesman of Italy's largest commercial bank said only
that it is "attentively following the situation" and will "in
any case abide by any decision the (Italian) government might
take."

   The bank last year was rocked by an international
financial scandal involving nearly $3 billion of irregular
credits to Iraq. The credits were extended by the bank's U.S.
branch in Atlanta without the authorization of its North
American management.
   The bank's top management was forced to resign over the
scandal, which is still being investigated by U.S. and
Italian authorities.
