   Akzo N.V. reported an unexpectedly steep 24% drop in
second-quarter profit and predicted that earnings would
continue to fall in the second half, although at a slower
rate.
   The Dutch chemical company, which has been hurt by falling
bulk chemical prices, Brazil's austerity program and the
dollar's slump, also promised further cost-cutting measures.

   Akzo's results "are indicative of the pain being felt in
the {chemical} industry," said Jackie Ashurst, an analyst at
James Capel &amp; Co. in London, adding: "I don't think we're
going to see any alleviation short term."
   Last week, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC reported a 21%
decline in first-half pretax profit, while Dow Chemical Co.'s
second-quarter net plunged 50%.
   Syb Bergsma, a member of Akzo's management committee,
acknowledged that the company's results were disappointing,
but said they would have been far worse if Akzo hadn't
diversified. The Dutch concern has slashed its synthetic
fibers division's work force and built up production of
drugs, paints and other coatings.
   Akzo's second-quarter net totaled 205.7 million guilders
($114.9 million), or 4.63 guilders a share, down from 270.6
million guilders, or 6.25 guilders a share. Sales fell 10% to
4.32 billion guilders from 4.79 billion guilders.
   For the first half, net slumped 18% to 407.4 million
guilders, or 9.17 guilders a share, from 498 million
guilders, or 11.50 guilders a share. Sales declined 4.2% to
8.9 billion guilders from 9.29 billion guilders.
   Akzo's Mr. Bergsma predicted that second-half net income
will drop less severely than in the first half. He said Akzo
believes bulk chemical prices will stabilize for the rest of
the year, although some analysts fear a further drop.
   The company plans to intensify efforts announced in April
to improve short-term earnings. Mr. Bergsma said Akzo will
seek to reduce administrative costs, streamline its sales
forces and trim spending on consultants and other outside
experts.
   Akzo blamed a large part of its problems on austerity
measures imposed last spring by Brazil, which accounts for
about 5% of the company's sales. The dollar's weakness also
hurt Akzo by making its products less competitive in
dollar-oriented markets and by reducing the guilder value of
Akzo's sales in the U.S.
