   NEW YORK -- Next week, Estee Lauder Cos., long known for
the regal, if somewhat stuffy, image of its flagship brand,
will start trying to win over a new generation of cosmetics
buyers: younger, hipper and greener.
   With the introduction next week of Origins, an earthy
botanical line, Lauder is trying to grapple with the problems
of its maturing core lines, including Estee Lauder and
Aramis, and increased competition from upstarts such as Body
Shop International PLC of the U.K. Origins will make its
debut at a Nordstrom Inc.'s department store in Seattle. But
Lauder plans to sell the new line through its own retail
stores eventually, a radical departure from company
tradition.

   "We consider ourselves explorers," says Leonard Lauder,
chief executive of the company. "This line is a good gamble
for us."
   Although Estee Lauder, which also markets the Clinique and
Prescriptives lines, continues to rule department store
cosmetics counters with an estimated 38.5% share, that domain
is increasingly troubled. A spate of retail mergers, combined
with the bankruptcy-protection filings earlier this year of
Campeau Corp.'s U.S. department store units, have cast a long
shadow over the retail industry.
   To sidestep those difficulties, Lauder has taken action.
The company rejuvenated the image of the company's flagship
line by repackaging the products, boosting prices by as much
as 50% and hiring Robin Burns, former president of Calvin
Klein cosmetics, to run the division. While at Calvin Klein,
Ms. Burns worked with Mr. Klein to develop the company's
torrid -- and highly successful -- perfume advertising.
   With Origins, Lauder is bent on attracting consumers who
may shop more in boutiques than in department stores. The new
products, which range in price from $8.50 to about $25, are
funkier than the company's traditional fare. The line is made
mostly from natural ingredients, which are neither derived
from nor tested on animals. It also includes so-called
aroma-therapy products, which promise their fragrance will
boost energy or ease tension when they are poured into a
bath. The company will even sell a small dose of potion
called "Peace of Mind" for only $10.
   It may sound a bit kooky, but the marketing clout of the
closely held Lauder, where revenue is believed to top $2
billion, gives the initiative credibility. "It's the first
real effort on the part of the industry to develop a new
customer base, young people who are put off by the glitzy
image of the business," says Allan Mottus, a consultant to
the cosmetics industry. "But if they really want to reach
younger consumers, they'll have to look outside department
stores."
   Lauder plans to do just that. Origins was initially
designed to be sold exclusively through free-standing,
company-owned stores, according to Leonard Lauder. But the
plan was scrapped because it would have taken as long as
three years to open just 30 locations, plenty of time for a
competitor to slip a similar line into department stores.
   People familiar with the project say Lauder is still
proceeding with the plan, albeit more cautiously. "With one
of the largest retail chains in the country in bankruptcy,"
says William Lauder, Leonard Lauder's son, who is running the
company's Origins unit, "we're keeping our options open." For
now, Lauder is keeping mum on the details. Insiders say the
company plans to open its own stores slowly, starting on the
East Coast.
   Although many clothing manufacturers, including Ralph
Lauren, Liz Claiborne Inc., and Anne Klein &amp; Co., have opened
their own stores, few cosmetics companies have followed their
lead. Elizabeth Arden, owned by the Anglo-Dutch
consumer-products marketer Unilever Group, operates 11 beauty
salons, but says it has no plans to expand its retailing
operations. "We view cosmetics as part of a fashion
portfolio," says James Miner, vice president of marketing for
Elizabeth Arden. "It's part of a total look, and the place
you get the rest of the look is a department store."
   But many in the cosmetics industry are reconsidering that
focus. "I can almost guarantee that any major manufacturer
that has depended primarily on upscale department stores is
looking for alternative methods of distribution," says Ken
Galloway, president of Retail Planning Associates' specialty
retailing unit.
   The transition to retailing won't be easy for Estee
Lauder. In addition to running the risk of irritating its
existing retailers, the company has no experience outside the
glitzy world of department-store cosmetics counters. Intent
on protecting its tony image, the company eschews selling
through drugstores. And people familiar with the project say
the company has had difficulties developing a team to manage
a retail unit and designing the individual stores.
   For now, however, the company will focus on making Origins
a success in U.S. department stores. In that respect, the
family-owned business has certain advantages, namely deep
pockets and lots of patience. Lauder's Prescriptives line of
cosmetics, for example, was introduced in department stores
in 1979, and is now among the fastest growing brands in
department stores. But the line took 10 years of tinkering
and nearly $40 million to perfect, and it is just starting to
turn a profit.
