   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent stock and bond prices
tumbling around the world.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 34.66 points to
close at 2864.60. Trading volume was the heaviest since last
October. The setback followed large declines in Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Europe as news of Middle East fighting sparked fears
of less-plentiful oil supplies, driving up oil prices.

   Surging oil prices in turn added to inflation fears and
prompted investors to unload bonds. Prices of 30-year
Treasury bonds nosedived nearly 1 1/4 points, or almost
$12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, the biggest decline in
more than three and one-half months. German, Japanese,
British, and French government bond prices also slumped.
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen, which was
depressed by Japan's heavy dependence on imported oil, but it
eked out only a small gain against the German mark.
   "Not since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 have we seen a
geopolitical event that threatens world oil production and
prices as much as this," said Peter Gignoux, an energy
specialist at Lehman Brothers in London.
   While long-term bonds fell out of favor, some investors
turned instead to short-term Treasury bills, traditionally a
haven in times of international crisis. "We saw some signs of
a flight to safety," said Anthony Woodruff, a managing
director at Kidder Peabody.
   Higher oil prices could jolt the U.S. economy, several
analysts said. "Higher oil prices are a tax on both
households and businesses, which means they will be spending
less money and bring the U.S. economy that much closer to a
recession," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at
Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
   Worries about oil also revived memories of 1973-1974, when
stock prices tanked following the Arab oil embargo. Among the
losers yesterday were stocks of airlines, trucking companies
and other transportation concerns that depend heavily on oil.
Consumer and other growth stocks that have been slumping
lately continued to drop. Big gainers included stocks of oil
and oil-service companies, as well as precious metals, mining
and coal companies.
   Middle East strife could reduce chances of significant
cuts in U.S. defense spending, compounding the problem of
slashing the bloated U.S. budget deficit, several analysts
said. Prices of many defense stocks such as Raytheon, General
Dynamics, and McDonnell Douglas, surged yesterday.
   Higher oil prices and accelerating inflation also could
pull interest rates even higher and make the Federal Reserve
unwilling to ease credit further, several economists
contended. But others dismissed these worries, arguing that
oil prices soon will begin dropping again because of a
world-wide oil glut. They also contend that the U.S. economy
already is so stagnant that interest rates are heading lower,
which will help revive economic activity and bolster stock
prices.
   "I think we may already be in a recession even though
people are afraid to call it one," said Mr. Woodruff of
Kidder. "All the economic statistics point to that."
   While U.S. stocks were bloodied, several foreign stock
markets fell even harder. The Dow industrials fell 1.2%, but
an index of Japanese stock prices dropped 1.9%. London and
Hong Kong shares each fell 1.5%.
   In major markets:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in heavy trading of 253.1 million shares
on the Big Board, where decliners outnumbered advancers by
1,211 to 464.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices tumbled. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year
bonds rose to 8.45% from 8.35% Wednesday.
