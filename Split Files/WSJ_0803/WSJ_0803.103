   GALVESTON, Texas -- The U.S. Coast Guard assumed financial
responsibility for cleaning up a 500,000-gallon oil spill
after the company whose barges leaked the crude stopped
footing the bills.
   "The barge company essentially said the money's gone, we
quit," said Chief Warrant Officer Richard M. Meidt, from the
Coast Guard's Pollution Response Division in Washington, D.C.
"If they're not going to clean it up, we will," he said. "Now
the Coast Guard is paying the bills and calling the shots."

   In a statement, Apex Towing Co., the owner of the barges,
said its insurer, Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association
(Bermuda) Ltd., advised it to relinquish control of the spill
control effort to the Coast Guard "so as not to jeopardize
our insurance coverage." The Coast Guard said it will attempt
to recover costs from Apex, in court if necessary.
   While the Coast Guard routinely picks up the tab for small
"mystery spills of unknown origin," rarely is it forced to
pay for such a large cleanup when the source is known.
Sanford E. Gaines, director of the University of Houston
Environmental Liability Law Program, said, the action "arises
out of a sense of frustration" on the part of the Coast
Guard, which has been roundly critized for its lack of
coordination and slow response. The Coast Guard yesterday
expressed some unhappiness with the speed at which equipment
arrived on the scene.
   Apex Towing, a division of Apex Oil Co., St. Louis, had
assumed sole financial responsibility for the cleanup until
now. Richard Golob, publisher of an industry newsletter, said
Apex probably agreed to shoulder costs initially because the
spill had been underestimated -- at 50,000 gallons -- by the
Coast Guard. Estimates were revised to 500,000 gallons after
divers assessed the leakage Monday.
   "A tenfold increase in amount spilled makes a big
difference" in clean up costs, Mr. Golob said. The company
has spent about $500,000 so far. The Coast Guard had no
estimate of how much more would be spent, but Chief Warrant
Officer Meidt said, "We're not looking at a great big massive
cleanup."
   Two Apex Towing barges collided with a Greek tanker, the
Shinoussa, Saturday, spilling a half million gallons of
partially refined crude oil into the bay. Since then, Apex
has gone to court to have liability for the accident placed
on the tanker owners. Officials for the Greek shipping
concern weren't immediately available to comment. A
spokeswoman for Apex wouldn't elaborate.
   Separately, the Houston Ship Channel was closed again
yesterday to all traffic, while the Coast Guard tried to move
the barge that spilled most of the oil into the bay. The
Texas Department of Health also closed off all fishing and
shrimping in the Bay pending testing for contamination.
