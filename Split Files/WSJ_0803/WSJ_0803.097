   Gold, the historic haven for investors in times of
calamity, is back in the spotlight because of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   But investors who didn't buy in time to catch the
$20-an-ounce price spike the past week or so should probably
wait. Gold's price over the near term is more likely to be
weak than strong, the pros say.

   "Historically, politically inspired moves in gold rarely
last more than a few hours," says Ronald Shorr, mining and
metals analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. "Usually these
political events are pretty good times to sell, not buy
gold."
   Gold prices, which rose to around $420 an ounce a few
months ago, were hammered down below $350 by mid-June on
heavy selling from Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union, Japan and
Brazil. This week, the metal's price had crawled back to the
$360-$370 level just before Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait.
   News of the invasion sent the price soaring yesterday to
above $386 a ounce, up more than $12 from Wednesday's close.
But gold then spent most of the day giving up its initial
gains. The spot price settled at $376.80, up $3.50.
   Prices are apt to remain jumpy in days ahead. But assuming
the Kuwait conflict doesn't spread, most gold experts expect
prices to weaken as traders take profits and cooler heads
prevail.
   "I really don't expect gold to explode from here -- if
that's what you're looking for, I think you'll be
disappointed," says John Charles Potvin, senior precious
metals analyst at Burns Fry Ltd. In any case, he says,
"you've got to have a much stronger argument to buy gold or
gold shares than just this one little Iraqi spark."
   During the political ups and downs of the past decade,
investors who looked to gold as a hedge against disaster
usually ended up wishing they had stayed in safe,
interest-bearing U.S. Treasury bills. Nowadays, even
individuals who are dubious about the dollar have other ways
to hedge, thanks to the availability of fixed-income mutual
funds that invest in short-term foreign-government
securities.
   "Even though gold has this `safe haven' power to gain
attention for short periods of time, it has not proved itself
competitive or sustainable with alternatives such as the
dollar, deutsche mark or Swiss franc," says Amy Gassman, who
analyzes gold stocks at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   As a result, she says, "we really emphasize that people
should look at gold as a trading vehicle: There are
opportunities to enter when the market is depressed, and it
makes sense to become a seller as gold becomes ebullient."
   With that in mind, investors who have strong stomachs and
a speculative bent may be able to profit from gold if they
wait for prices to pull back, or if they're willing to bet
that the Mideast conflict is going to spread.
   "If you have a trading orientation, it may be a time to
take a fling in gold," says Michael Sherman, chief investment
strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. However, he adds,
"I'd keep very tight limits on my position -- I wouldn't want
to be exposed even overnight."
   Ms. Gassman says speculators may find gold stocks a better
trading vehicle than bullion, since they typically rack up
greater percentage gains for a given rise in gold's price.
But she adds a few caveats.
   "I'd wait for a 5% pullback in these stocks' prices," she
says, "and since some gold stocks have already had dramatic
run-ups in price recently, I'd look at the laggards." Lastly,
she says, "don't be greedy -- start taking profits once these
stocks move 10%."
   The Iraqi invasion fanned the modestly bullish sentiment
on gold that had been gaining ground on Wall Street in recent
weeks. It's not that price forecasts have altered -- most
analysts are still predicting prices will fluctuate between
$400 and $450 an ounce next year, with a few mavericks more
bearish or more bullish than that. But positive sentiment is
less apologetic than it was a week ago.
   "I think the most important Iraqi impact {on gold} is that
it's helping turn the psychology that tended to be negative
to neutral or slightly positive," says Burns Fry's Mr.
Potvin.
   One of the strongest factors revving bullish sentiment is
the supply-and-demand outlook for the gold market itself.
South African gold producers remain threatened -- not only by
political uncertainty but also by high and rising costs that
make a significant portion of their output uneconomic at
current prices and exchange rates.
   What's more, "the percentage growth in gold-mine
production in the U.S., Canada and Australia has been very
high in the last decade, and in the next few years that will
drop," says Leanne Baker, manager of commodity research of
Philipp Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc.
   For some analysts, that makes North American gold stocks
look like good investments for the longer term.
   The most bullish view comes from John Tumazos, metals
analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.: "I
think this is the first time in the last 15 years when it's
been possible to buy gold at close to its production cost,
which makes this a unique and fortuitous time in the gold
market." His forecast is for gold to "spike up next year to
$550, with $450 as a long-term average."
   Maybe. But widows and orphans -- and even investors with
normal appetites for risk -- will probably want to sit this
one out, at least for now. Not only is gold itself
notoriously hard to predict, but gold stocks are by no means
cheap. They are already selling at prices that are roughly
twice as high relative to earnings as the market as a whole.
   Beside the risk of a falling stock market, there are
significant fundamentals working against gold that could
undercut gold stock investors in the months ahead. Chief
among them is the fact that interest rates on most major
currencies remain at levels that compete very effectively
with gold.
   For gold to be worthwhile, therefore, investors must
assume that prices will rise enough to make up for that
forgone interest -- as well as to cover storage and other
costs associated with holding gold.
   Meanwhile, despite the impression in some quarters that
the Federal Reserve System is being forced to relax its
vigilance on inflation to prop up banks and the economy,
inflation in the U.S. and other major countries is still
tightly in check. Until there is clear evidence that
situation is changing, gold probably won't go far for long.
While Mideast instability will undoubtedly fan fears about
higher oil prices, buoying gold's fundamentals, most analysts
feel its real consequences for inflation will be modest.
   Based on such fundamentals, Bear Stearns's Mr. Shorr sees
gold plummeting to a new low of about $325 an ounce in late
1990 or early 1991 and fluctuating between $325 and $375 for
most of next year. "Longer term I see some prospects, but I
think it's very tough to make a bullish case in the near
term," he says.
