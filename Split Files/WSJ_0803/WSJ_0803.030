   ("Companies who have been accused of being environmentally
insensitive are funding municipal aquariums." -- Fortune)
                                                                                                       

   Some companies who've had bad press
   (More so than they would wish),
   In looking to improve PR
   Are reeling in the fish.
   They're pouring money into plans
   To house aquatic creatures,
   Hoping generosity
   Will dampen other features.
   They hope to drown their critics out,
   To silence or to bury 'em;
   They look forward to the dawning of
   The new Age of Aquarium.

   Mature Judgment
                                                                                                       

   Everything's relative, they say,
   And that goes for the passage of time:
   Old age is always fifteen years
   Older than what I'm.
   -- George O. Ludcke.
