   Israel Baline, an orthodox cantor's son, sailed with his
family into New York harbor in 1893. Eight Balines and a
paying boarder shared three rooms; when he was 13 Izzy quit
school and eventually worked as a singing waiter in a
Chinatown dance hall popular with tourists hoping to see a
real opium addict.
   The happy response greeting his rendition of a song he
wrote himself ("Marie From Sunny Italy") inspired Baline to
change his name and head for Tin Pan Alley. Soon he was
dictating his prodigious nocturnal output (sometimes five
songs in as many hours of insomnia) to professional
transcribers in a voice that sounded alternately like a
foghorn and an old man imitating a hysterical teenager. He
remained a musical illiterate his whole life.

   The romanticized version of Irving Berlin's life was
written by his friend Alexander Woollcott when Berlin, 37,
already was earning more than $160,000 a year from song
royalties. "As Thousands Cheer" (Viking, 674 pages, $24.95)
is Laurence Bergreen's antidote to Woollcott's 1925 fluff.
His Berlin is an inspired amateur and national schmaltz
machine who now and again managed to write something more
complex, say "Russian Lullaby" or "Cheek to Cheek."
   Successful immigrant incarnate, Berlin pleased his
American dream-starved public by earning millions, buying his
mother a house in "the country" (then the Bronx), and
marrying out of his class. The "farloyrene menshen" (lost
souls) who never made it included Berlin's younger sister
Sarah, whom he gave $100 a month once he struck it rich;
after 61 years of bad health and depression, she leapt from
the roof of her Brooklyn tenement.
   Based on 200 interviews, "As Thousands Cheer" is as much
about the music business as it is Berlin's story, though Mr.
Bergreen had no help from the songwriter himself, who died
last September and usually responded to phone calls from
musicologists with expletives. Berlin as he got older, and
then very old, disliked having his tunes analyzed.
   Mr. Bergreen does exactly what Berlin would have abhorred:
He has put the life and songs in the context of 20th-century
vernacular music history. He describes, for example, how
Berlin cashed in on ragtime with "Alexander's Ragtime Band,"
although it "contained almost no syncopation." This did not
stop Berlin from accepting the title Ragtime King, or stir
him to learn a little more about compositional techniques.
"The actual nature of ragtime music continued to elude this
untrained musician," Mr. Bergreen writes.
   Berlin preferred to spend more time on his own appearance.
Mr. Bergreen describes how Berlin dressed uptown before he
lived there, wearing "the most fashionable and expensive
suits he could afford, suits with tight trousers and fancy
lapels." Indeed, descriptions of "the little man" with hair
"pomaded to a respectable gloss" run through the text like a
maddeningly simple refrain.
   In 1925 Berlin married Ellin Mackay -- a pampered Catholic
who introduced herself to Berlin in a speakeasy and sneaked
off with him to City Hall. It was 22-year-old Ellin's first
subway ride. Her father, owner of Postal Telegraph Co.,
instantly cut off her $50,000-a-year trust fund. Later,
Clarence Mackay lost $36 million in the Depression and Berlin
gave him a million to tide him over. Mackay still snubbed
him.
   Generous according to his whims (he didn't like direct
requests), Berlin's fame made him the target of frequent
handout pleas. If his closet got full, he distributed
hand-tailored shirts around the office. He could be remote
and willfully hateful: When his sister Ruth's son, Irving
Berlin Kahn, approached Berlin for help with his mother's
cancer-treatment bills, he refused and as a parting shot told
his nephew to drop his middle name: "Use the initial. Please
don't use my name."
   In 1963 Berlin put together his last score -- 10 fresh
songs, 15 old hits -- for a Hollywood retrospective, "Say It
With Music." When the project collapsed after six years and
several discarded scripts, so, in a way, did Berlin. Still,
one wonders about Mr. Bergreen calling him a "has-been" and
"unemployed" (with their hint of shame, rather odd words to
use for a man who was then 76 years old).
   As he grew yet more ancient and "misanthropic," Berlin hid
out in his multi-million-dollar Beekman Place home till his
death at 101, dining alone with Ellin, until she predeceased
him by a year. He sat to her left and she said she only
needed to fix that side of her hair when she dressed for
supper.
   Mr. Bergreen presents Berlin's life as one massive attempt
at assimilation, and he has made an often interesting theme
of the ironies inherent in the composer's efforts to fit in.
In separating the man from his myth, his biography exerts
considerable fascination. Berlin certainly was not a man one
wished to encounter cheek to cheek. Still, does it really
make sense to view the songwriter's about face to the world
as the petulant exit of a man "tormented" because he no
longer occupied center stage? Was it not a stance Berlin was
entitled to take after 62 years in the business?
