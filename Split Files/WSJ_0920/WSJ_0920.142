   Apple Computer Inc., struggling to complete a new
operating system for its flagship Macintosh family, said it
won't complete the job until the first half of next year.
   Apple, whose stock fell 87.5 cents to $32.50 in
over-the-counter trading yesterday, has billed the operating
system, a software program that controls the basic functions
of the Macintosh, as the biggest advance in software for the
computer since its introduction in 1984. Apple had hoped to
ship the operating system to customers this summer, but in
May pushed the date back to October.

   This delay shouldn't harm Apple since the operating system
is mainly aimed at Apple's high-end computers, said Bruce
Lupatkin, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist. In mid-October,
the company is expected to introduce two low-end computers,
which can't make much use of the new operating system anyway,
he said.
   Delays in the release of the operating system are
worrisome, however, since Apple is under pressure from
Microsoft Corp., which supplies operating systems to Apple's
competitors in the personal computer business, to make
further improvements to Macintosh software. Apple said it
expects to release test copies of the operating system to
software developers in October.
