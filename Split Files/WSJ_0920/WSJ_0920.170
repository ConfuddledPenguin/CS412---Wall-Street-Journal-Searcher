   College textbooks, monoliths of the publishing industry,
are being pulled apart at the seams by new computer and
photocopier technology.
   The technologies are allowing professors to custom-design
textbooks for their courses, picking articles and excerpts at
will and having them produced cheaply in extremely limited
editions. These new custom books have triggered a fierce
marketing war in the $2 billion college-textbook market by
blurring distinctions among publisher, bookseller and copy
shop.

   Behind the struggle is a grass-roots academic movement
that is changing the way college courses are taught.
Retailers estimate these customized books make up about a
10th of all college texts today, up from virtually nothing 10
years ago. Most of them are simple photocopies, but advances
in computers have made it possible for a professor to order
chapters from a publisher's data base, add personal handouts
and receive a laser-printed paperback days later. Professors
are pushing the new technology because it lets them keep up
with fast-changing fields and put their own distinctive
stamps on reading lists.
   The trend is throwing the traditional book business into
disarray. Copy shops are suddenly metamorphosing into
publishers and bookstores. Bookstores, finding themselves
elbowed out of the distribution channel, are scrambling to
turn themselves into publishers. And publishers are dreaming
up elaborate new strategies to beat the photocopiers at their
own game.
   "College stores and publishers are in the midst of a major
transition into being service industries," says Kenneth
Green, a senior researcher at the University of Southern
California's Center for Scholarly Technology. Mr. Green
foresees a day when students and professors will call up
texts, software and data from workstations on campus. The
publishers' and bookstores' roles will be to update the
computer systems and help people use them.
   Signs of the new battle are everywhere. One canny national
chain of copy shops, Kinko's Service Corp., runs a successful
service called Professor Publishing at about 200 outlets
around the country. Kinko's solicits course reading lists and
then creates bound anthologies that it sells to students. The
business is diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars away
from bookstores and publishers.
   The book industry is fighting back. Eight big publishers
have sued Kinko's for copyright violations, in a closely
watched case scheduled to reach trial in a New York federal
court next month. Kinko's, based in Ventura, Calif., claims
its service falls within the bounds of permissible copying.
Booksellers and teachers hope the case will clarify gray
areas in the copyright law, which permits "fair" educational
photocopying but doesn't clearly define what that means.
   Meanwhile, book companies are racing to adapt themselves
to the new textbook marketplace. This summer, McGraw-Hill
Inc., one of the country's biggest publishers, is starting a
project that lets professors order tailor-made versions of
college textbooks. The publisher loads a book and lots of
supplementary articles onto a computer and prints out
whatever material a teacher wants, in any order. McGraw-Hill
says, in some cases, it might ultimately bypass bookstores
altogether, by letting professors dial up the data base from
their personal computers.
   "We're trying to move the whole publishing industry in
this direction," says McGraw-Hill Chairman Joseph L. Dionne,
a former high-school teacher. Customizing all published
material -- magazines, newsletters and someday maybe even
consumer books -- is a crucial part of McGraw-Hill's
long-term strategy, he says.
   Another big publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, has a new joint
venture to create custom textbooks with the biggest operator
of college bookstores, Follett Corp. Follett will take
professors' orders, run off copies and sell the anthologies,
while Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Paramount Communications
Inc., will line up reprint permissions. Chicago-based
Follett, which runs about 300 stores, also has a venture in
the works to enter the copy-shop business.
   Custom publishing should heat up even more in October,
when Xerox Corp. is expected to introduce its long-awaited
first digital copier. The device will turn printed pages into
computer data that can be manipulated, copied, laser-printed
or transmitted. Xerox won't discuss the product, but
officials familiar with the company's plans expect it to
target custom publishing as an important market.
   The rush to produce custom textbooks is also leading to
some low-tech approaches. To compete with a new McGraw-Hill
customized accounting book, publisher Richard D. Irwin Inc.,
a unit of Times Mirror Co., has been ripping the spines off
its rival text, punching holes in the pages, and offering
chapters in loose-leaf binders.
   These developments will provide consumers with the means
to shape books in the same way that technology is giving
people control over other media. Movies and TV shows today
are grist for the videocassette recorder. Recordings get
mixed and matched on home tape decks and on a popular new
machine called Personics, which gives record-store customers
their choice of songs on a cassette.
   For students, the new customized texts can offer lower
prices. The first book in McGraw-Hill's project, an
accounting text by Robert and Walter Meigs, costs $43.95 in
its conventional form. The first customized versions,
featuring only the chapters a professor actually plans to
use, might typically cost half to two-thirds of that.
McGraw-Hill sets the price and pays royalties based on how
many selections a professor orders.
   On the other hand, customized textbooks can't always be
resold to other students, since teachers like to fiddle with
their reading lists from year to year. That's good news for
publishers and bookstores that compete against the used
marketplace, but for students, it wipes out an important
source of cash and bargains.
   For authors, customized books offer the possibility of a
wider audience and a new way to keep books current. Louis
Fisher, author of a constitutional law book that McGraw-Hill
is also offering in customized form, looks forward to
regularly updating his text by dropping new decisions and
articles into his data base.
   But he worries about his status in a publishing system
that cuts his words loose from the printed page and sends
them floating freely in an electronic data base: "What
happens if someone wants only 70% of Chapter Eight? The
student may not get the whole picture the way I want to
present it, and that's a little troublesome."
   He also has qualms about having his work thrown into the
same electronic pool with other authors. "Maybe I think the
article is incompetent and unprofessional," he says. "I would
be in a sense promoting an article that was poorly researched
and below standards."
   To some extent, these are issues that authors already face
in traditional anthology publishing. "There's always the risk
that your book could be juxtaposed with some demeaning thing
on a bookstore shelf for that matter," says Michael Sandel, a
Harvard political scientist who uses photocopied anthologies
in his courses. "Once you write a book, you lose a certain
amount of control over its interpretation and its
presentation anyhow."
   McGraw-Hill says it plans to let authors veto material
they don't want to be alongside, but it admits the policy
could make its customized books less attractive to teachers.
"The author may eliminate his market," worries Robert Lynch,
director of the custom-publishing project.
   The spread of computers on campuses is sure to make the
textbook market even more chaotic. Students and teachers are
starting to have access to optical scanners that can store
images of book pages on computer disks.
   "If illegal copying is currently having an impact, the
advent of electrocopying could increase it tenfold," warns
Gary Shapiro, deputy executive director of the National
Association of College Stores. The association represents
2,900 stores with about $5 billion in revenues. "The
potential impact of technology on the textbook makes the
future of this product, the primary reason for our industry's
existence, uncertain," he says.
   At the same time, many universities are setting up
powerful networks that will someday be linked to personal
computers in all of their offices and dormitory rooms.
"Inevitably, the students are going to get to the point where
they've got a quiz coming up on Chapter 13, it's a pain to
read it on the screen, so they'll print it out for
themselves," says Robert Follett, chairman of the Follett
bookstore chain. "That does bypass the bookstore. And at this
point, I don't have an answer for that."
