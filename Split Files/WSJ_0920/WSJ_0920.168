   NEW YORK -- A group of United Airlines unions asked 26
banks to decide by Oct. 3 whether they will help finance a
new $175-a-share, or $3.82 billion, bid for UAL Corp., the
airline's Chicago-based parent.
   Gerald Greenwald, the unions' nominee to become UAL
chairman if the on-again, off-again bid succeeds, set the
bank deadline to be six days prior to the Oct. 9 expiration
of the unions' right to acquire UAL at a higher price.

   The UAL board, which accepted a union bid of $201 a share,
or $4.38 billion, on April 9, has demanded that any revised
offer provide "commensurate value" with the $201-a-share
package.
   At a meeting of interested banks held yesterday, Mr.
Greenwald said the new offer would include $150 a share in
cash and leave 15% of the stock in the airline in public
hands.
   Financing for the proposed offer would include about $2
billion in bank debt; $750 million in debt supplied by
airline equipment vendors, possibly such as Seattle-based
Boeing Co. and the European aircraft consortium Airbus
Industrie; and $200 million in equity, possibly from a
foreign airline, such as British Airways.
   One person familiar with the transaction said that,
although the banks' reaction to the terms of the deal was
generally positive, "the problem is going to be getting over
the history of the transaction, the psychological and
philosphical factors." Two earlier versions of the buy-out
have collapsed in the past year.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
UAL shares fell $5 to close at $100, amid a sell-off in many
takeover-related stocks, sparked by adverse developments in
pending sales of American General Corp. and Corroon &amp; Black
Corp.
