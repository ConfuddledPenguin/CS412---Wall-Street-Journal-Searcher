   NEW YORK -- Sterling tumbled after the Bundesbank
president said "big problems" in Britain's economy raise
questions about whether the pound can be pegged tightly to
the mark within the European Monetary System.
   Later, in answer to a question from a Reuters reporter,
Karl Otto Poehl said he didn't pass judgment on whether the
pound is ready to enter the EMS's exchange-rate mechanism.

   But the market reacted strongly because his earlier
remarks seemed to fit a pattern of sniping between Britain
and Germany over European cooperation, said Marc Cohen, a
corporate foreign-exchange trader in New York for Fuji Bank.
   In late New York trading, sterling was quoted at $1.8845,
down from $1.9140 late Tuesday in New York. Against the mark,
the British currency slid to 2.9615 marks late in the day
from 2.9724 marks late Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the mark but slid
against the Japanese currency. Late in the New York trading
day, the U.S. currency was at 1.5715 marks, up from 1.5530
marks late Tuesday. It declined to 137.52 yen from 137.85
yen.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 137.35 yen, down from 138.05 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5695 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5526
marks.
   Pound selling on the Poehl comments in the early European
afternoon began in the mark cross sector and spread to the
dollar and yen. Similarly, it was a technical floor in the
sterling-mark price that limited the pound's losses
generally.
   The British currency has appreciated about 14% since early
summer on speculation of imminent entry into the
exchange-rate mechanism -- which would give sterling a stable
price range as well as its current advantage of high domestic
interest rates. Such rates make a currency attractive to
international investors.
   But the German central banker's remarks cast a cloud over
sterling. His opinion is considered crucial because Europe's
exchange-rate mechanism is anchored by the mark. Moreover,
the Bundesbank, along with other European central banks,
would be obliged to spend its own money to support the pound
were the British currency to depreciate after joining the
exchange-rate mechanism.
   In a thinly veiled reference to Britain, Mr. Poehl said a
country with "three times the inflation" of Germany can't
expect to peg its currency to the mark for long without
requiring "enormous" intra-European Community transfer
payments. He didn't elaborate.
   A U.K. Treasury spokesman responded: "We have announced
our intention to enter {the exchange-rate mechanism} when the
time is right, and our position remains unchanged."
   Sterling's decline yesterday was exaggerated by the
dollar's firmness after the first hints of Federal Reserve
concern about the greenback's recent losses.
   Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said "the weaker dollar
adds upward pressure to U.S. import prices and hence raises
further concern about inflation and instability."
   Erik Lehtis, a New York dealer with France's Credit
Agricole, said "Greenspan's suggestion that there's a
downside to the dollar's decline gave the market ideas that
he won't let the dollar fall any further."
   But currency traders plucked Mr. Greenspan's comment about
the dollar out of a wide-ranging testimony that many
considered contradictory. "People were picking parts {of the
testimony} to trade on," said Jeff Mondschein, managing
director of foreign exchange for Continental Bank in Chicago.
   Fed watchers were uncertain what action, if any, Mr.
Greenspan would take to support the dollar. His concern
seemed to put him at odds with the Treasury, which is thought
to be a dominant partner in joint market interventions. On
Monday, Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford called the
dollar's retreat orderly and credited it with helping to
close the U.S. trade deficit.
   Dealers said Mr. Greenspan's remarks appeared to be aimed
at the dollar's mark price, which remains near a record low
of 1.5385 marks, set Aug. 27, and not its yen price, still
about 17 yen above its low of 120.95 yen, set Nov. 24, 1988.
   The dollar ended European dealings moderately stronger,
helped largely by covering of short positions after Mr.
Greenspan's comments. But London dealers said market
participants are still holding substantial short, or
oversold, dollar positions. That should continue to support
the U.S. currency.
   The dollar finished mixed in Tokyo after a session of
active trading, while the yen declined. The dollar was last
quoted Wednesday in Tokyo at 138.05 yen, above 137.68 yen
late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $386 an ounce, down $1.60. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.1 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$385.55 an ounce.
