   With their word flow showing no drouth,
   Give new meaning to the nickname
   When they're labeled "motor-mouth."

   I'm sorry for the dodo bird,
   That's said not to exist --
   But I concede that it's a breed
   I really haven't missed.

   Success can come from getting along with people you can't
get ahead of.
