   Just three months after Maybelline Inc. was acquired by
Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co., the cosmetics maker's president
and chief executive officer, Gary Mulloy, has abruptly
resigned.
   Company insiders said Mr. Mulloy, who had worked at
Maybelline for 15 years and served as chief executive since
January, quit because of mounting interference from his
superiors at Wasserstein.

   Robert B. McKeon, chairman of Wasserstein, Perella
Management Partners, an arm of the parent, called charges of
management interference inaccurate, saying he has visited
Maybelline's Memphis headquarters only four times since the
company was acquired.
   "When we acquired the company back in June, our plan was
to keep Gary through our transition," Mr. McKeon said. "He's
just moving on to other things." Mr. McKeon said he
personally will fill Maybelline's top job until Mr. Mulloy's
successor is chosen. Company insiders said a candidate wasn't
apparent.
   Reached at home yesterday, Mr. Mulloy also said he had
planned to remain at Maybelline "only through the transition
period." He added that he was interested in leaving the
cosmetics industry and would prefer the management challenge
of a turnaround situation. "It's time for me to do something
else," he said.
   Yet at the time of the acquisition, Mr. Mulloy told
reporters he planned to stay at the company indefinitely. And
company insiders said Mr. Mulloy was upset recently over what
he believed was interference in the company's advertising
strategy. There had been rumors on Madison Avenue that the
company was considering changing advertising agencies.
   Earlier this month, Maybelline consolidated its
advertising business at DDB Needham Worldwide in Chicago,
moving a small account for its Shine Free cosmetics line from
the Bloom Agency in Dallas. A spokeswoman for DDB Needham
said she didn't believe the Maybelline account was up for
review. "We just got a new piece of business from them," said
the spokeswoman. "We've hired several new creative people to
work on the account."
   Mr. Mulloy's departure marks the latest twist in
Maybelline's labyrinthine corporate history. Schering-Plough
put the cosmetics unit on the block in December. In April,
MBP Acquisition Corp., an investment group that included
Playtex Family Products Corp., had agreed to acquire
Maybelline for $300 million. When that deal collapsed
suddenly a few months later, Wasserstein was apparently
poised to step in. The sale price was unchanged at $300
million.
   With 1989 sales of about $300 million, Maybelline is the
No. 2 brand of cosmetics sold through mass merchandise
outlets. Although its share of the mass market for cosmetics
has held at about 18%, it continues to trail rival Cover Girl
Cosmetics, which was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. last
year.
