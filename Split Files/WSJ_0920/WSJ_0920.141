   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund,
contradicting growing fears of recession, predicted that
world economic activity generally will pick up speed next
year. But it acknowledged that rising oil prices have taken a
toll on business activity.
   In its latest semiannual survey of the world economy, the
IMF forecast that world economic growth this year will slow
to about 2% after inflation from 3% in 1989, and then will
pick up to a 2.4% clip in 1991. For the U.S., the
international agency forecast that output will expand 1.3%
this year and 1.7% in 1991, compared with a 2.5% growth rate
in 1989.

   In May, before the rise in oil prices, the international
agency was projecting healthier world economic growth rates
of 2.3% this year and 3.1% in 1991. For the U.S., it was
anticipating growth of 1.7% this year and 2.3% in 1991.
   Despite the lowered forecast, the IMF doesn't expect a
recession. "We don't believe there's a negative quarter
anywhere, said Ernesto Hernandez Cata, an IMF economist,
discussing forecasts for the U.S.
   The agency predicted that the pickup in the global economy
next year will be led by strong growth in Japan and Western
Europe. It stressed that the medium-term outlook for the
world economy "remains strongly influenced by the
far-reaching changes currently taking place in Europe,"
particularly the 1992 economic integration of the European
Community, German unification and economic and political
changes in Eastern Europe.
   Growth in the industrialized countries will average 2.5%
in 1990 and 1991, down from almost 4% rate in 1988 and 1989,
according to the IMF's latest forecast.
   Because of economic reforms associated with the transition
toward more market-oriented economies, output is expected to
stagnate in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe this year and
next. The rise in oil prices, and the need to pay for oil in
hard currencies, will hit East European countries
particularly, the IMF said.
   Meanwhile, German unification will involve a rise in
investment relative to saving. That, coupled with high levels
of resource utilization in the industrial world will result
in some upward pressure on German prices, interest rates and
the value of the mark, the IMF said.
   The IMF forecast is based on national policies and
exchange rates as of last month. But some of its assumptions
are relatively optimistic. It assumed that oil prices will
average $22.75 a barrel next year, down from current levels
of about $33 a barrel, and that the recent decline in the
dollar will boost U.S. exports while lower U.S. interest
rates also will spur growth next year.
   The U.S. current account deficit will rise slightly to
$99.7 billion in 1991 from an estimated $97 billion this
year, according to the IMF forecast. The deficit totaled $110
billion in 1989. The current account is a measure of a
nation's trade in goods and services.
   The international agency predicted that U.S. inflation
will accelerate slightly to 4.3% this year from 4.1% in 1989
before moderating to 4.2% in 1991. Altogether, the IMF
forecast that inflation in the industrialized countries will
run at a 4.8% rate this year, up from 4.4% in 1989.
   But the IMF predicted that inflation will slow to 16.1%
next year in developing countries, compared to 104.8% this
year. That rosy forecast is based on the assumption that
developing countries as a group will bounce back to economic
health in 1991, with an average economic growth rate of 4.2%
compared to 2.2% in 1990.
