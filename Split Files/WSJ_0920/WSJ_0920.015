   WASHINGTON -- Voters in two distinct political cultures
delivered a distinct message: They're tired of politics and
politicians.
   Massachusetts voters, in an expression of voter
alienation, selected the outspoken John Silber as the
Democratic nominee for governor.

   Oklahoma voters, by a large margin, approved a limit on
state lawmakers' tenure. The amendment, which takes effect
Jan. 1, will restrict legislators to 12 years in office.
Those now in office will be allowed to serve 12 more years.
   The upset triumph of Mr. Silber, who is on leave as
president of Boston University, over former state Attorney
General Francis Bellotti came as Massachusetts voters turned
away politicians with ties to Gov. Michael Dukakis, the 1988
Democratic presidential nominee. One of the losers in
Tuesday's primary balloting was Democratic Attorney General
James Shannon.
   Mr. Silber, a tough-talking Texan who came to symbolize
Bay State resentment of the political establishment, will
face former federal prosecutor William Weld, another
political outsider who pulled off an upset in the Republican
gubernatorial primary. He defeated House Minority Leader
Steven Pierce.
   The Massachusetts results were a rebuke to what candidates
in both parties called "politics-as-usual" and brought to an
end an era dominated by Mr. Dukakis, who served three terms
as governor. In the face of mounting criticism and burgeoning
budget deficits, he declined to seek another term.
   "The choice is between leadership proven by experience or
more of the same," Mr. Silber said at his victory party.
"Have you had enough? I think you have. Then join me in
taking back our government."
