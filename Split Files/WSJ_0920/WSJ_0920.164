   WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office said it is
concerned that bank regulators are making some of the same
mistakes that led to the savings-and-loan crisis, and called
for banks to put up more capital to protect the deposit
insurance fund.
   "We don't think we are in a crisis situation with the
banking industry, but we think now is the time to take steps
to make sure it doesn't happen," Richard Fogel, GAO assistant
comptroller general, testified before the House Banking
Committee.

   The GAO, outlining a plan to strengthen the banking
industry to avoid a taxpayer bailout of the government
insurance fund, also recommended that required capital levels
for banks be increased beyond the floors in a risk-based
capital system that will be phased in at the end of this
year. The GAO didn't recommend any specific capital levels,
but said the new levels could be phased in over five years or
more to make it easier for banks to raise the money.
   Significantly, the GAO shied away from recommendations to
fundamentally change the deposit-insurance system itself --
such as lowering the $100,000 insurance limit per account or
limiting depositors to a few accounts -- for fear of
"destabilizing the system."
   The GAO's emphasis on capital and supervision, and its
worries about the possible disruption from major changes to
the deposit insurance system, echoed the views expressed by
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan several weeks
ago.
   On the other side of the growing debate are some
congressmen, who would like to explicitly limit the
government's liability by cutting back coverage, and parts of
the banking industry, which fears Congress won't grant banks
new securities and insurance powers unless coverage is
reduced. The GAO plan "doesn't seem to address
deposit-insurance reform," said a spokeswoman for the
American Bankers Association.
   The GAO said, "We question, on grounds of stability,
whether reducing deposit insurance coverage . . . should be
the centerpiece of reform." Instead, the GAO exhorted
Congress to make sure regulators are closing troubled banks
quickly enough, before they pile up losses that the deposit
insurance fund must later handle when the bank fails.
   The GAO is so concerned about the regulators that it
called for a presidentially appointed panel to conduct a "top
to bottom" study of the regulators' procedures and skills.
The GAO also said the regulators shouldn't be given as much
discretion as they have now to allow troubled banks to grow
or pay dividends, among other actions.
   While the GAO didn't present a blanket criticism of the
bank regulators, the agency did warn that they may, in some
cases, be following the dangerous path of their thrift
counterparts in allowing troubled institutions to remain open
too long. Most experts agree that much of the $150 billion
cost of the S&amp;L industry bailout could have been avoided had
hundreds of troubled thrifts in the 1980s not been allowed to
operate for years.
   The agency, an investigative arm of Congress, singled out
the regulators' recent handling of the failure of the
National Bank of Washington as a sign of its concern. The
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency used new powers
granted to it last year to close the bank while it still had
some equity capital remaining. (Previously, regulators
usually waited until complete insolvency.)
   But the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has said it
expects to lose about $500 million, or about 30% of the
bank's assets, bailing out the institution, which "indicates
that OCC did not act soon enough," the GAO said. A spokesman
for the Comptroller didn't have any immediate comment.
