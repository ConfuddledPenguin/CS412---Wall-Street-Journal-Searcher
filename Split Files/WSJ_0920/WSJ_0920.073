   American General Corp., claiming that it's having trouble
finding a buyer for the whole company, said it may settle for
selling only its core, home service life insurance business.
   The Houston-based financial services concern, which placed
itself on the auction block in May after turning down a $6
billion, or $50-a-share, takeover bid from Torchmark Corp.,
blamed "current international and economic uncertainty" for
the apparent lack of buyer interest.

   That bleak description sent shock waves through the entire
market for takeover stocks. American General plunged $6.375
to $33.625 a share in composite trading yesterday on the New
York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, UAL Corp., the parent of
United Airlines, skidded $5 to $100.
   The news was compounded by an announcement by Aon Corp.
that it doesn't intend to pursue a proposed bid for Corroon &amp;
Black, a New York insurance broker, after Corroon rejected
Aon's bid late yesterday. Corroon stock tumbled $3.50 to $32.
   But skeptics also questioned whether American General has
been shopping itself as vigorously as it might. Under the
alternative restructuring plan sketched out yesterday,
current management would stay at the helm of a restructured
American General. The principal businesses of the
restructured company, including a tax-qualified annuities
unit, real estate operations and a consumer finance
subsidiary, would have assets of $24.9 billion and equity of
$3.5 billion. In 1989 those businesses earned $235 million,
the company said.
   "With this kind of action, management looks like it's
protecting its own positions," said one analyst, who asked
not to be quoted by name.
   In an interview, Harold S. Hook, American General's
chairman, denied that the company has dragged its heels or
that he's trying to hold onto power. He said the company's
preference is still to sell itself whole, and attributed the
slow progress to the complexity and size of American General.
"The mechanics of things like this take a little time," he
said.
   Still, such speculation has been fueled by the fact that
American General has been slow to circulate its books to
potential buyers. According to one consultant, the company
didn't complete actuarial appraisals of its insurance
businesses until about three weeks ago.
   And it apparently hasn't yet come up with a plan to allow
Torchmark, which at one time was its most eager suitor, to
peek at its books. Jon Rotenstreich, Torchmark's president,
said the Birmingham, Ala., insurer hasn't seen them because
it refuses to sign a confidentiality agreement required by
American General. That agreement, Mr. Rotenstreich said,
"would have precluded us from making any appeal to their
shareholders" at American General's annual meeting in 1991.
   Torchmark sparked American General's self-auction in March
by offering more than $6 billion in cash and securities for
the whole company. American General turned down the proposal
at the time, but later decided to stage an auction in order
to seek a higher price.
   Mr. Rotenstreich called American General's latest
announcement "encouraging," but stopped short of saying
whether his company would make a separate bid for American
General's core home service life insurance unit, a cash cow
that focuses on selling life insurance door-to-door to people
of moderate income.
   Mr. Rotenstreich said Torchmark still believes it could
finance the purchase of American General, despite market
uncertainties and a drop in Torchmark's own stock price. In
Big Board composite trading yesterday, Torchmark shares
closed at $44.75, down 25 cents.
   American General's latest plan would be complicated by the
fact that it would want to make any home service sale be
"tax-effective." Although it isn't clear what the company
means by that, several analysts said it would likely require
that the assets be acquired for stock rather than cash. Such
a transaction would require approval from the Internal
Revenue Service.
   Analysts said American General's announcement will likely
generate new bidder interest. The home service operations,
with assets of $8.9 billion, equity of $3.0 billion, and 1989
earnings of $305 million, would make a good strategic fit
with a number of foreign or domestic companies, they said.
   Thomas Richter, an analyst with Robinson Humphrey Co.,
Atlanta, estimated that the home-service unit itself would
likely fetch $25 to $30 a share, or about $3 billion to $3.6
billion. But he said American General might try to unload its
corporate-level debt, which he valued at $15 a share, along
with the unit. The remaining operations have a book value of
$29 a share, he added.
