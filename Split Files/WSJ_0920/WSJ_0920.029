   COSTS SOAR in Seoul. Services outpace Manhattan's, while
rents rival Tokyo's.
   Goods and services in the capital cost 40% to 80% more
than in New York, depending on how well an expatriate lives,
says Organizational Resources Counselors Inc. Tokyo's price
spiral actually slowed in the past two years, but not so in
Seoul. Residential rents now are nearly identical in the two
Asian cities -- and Korean landlords demand payment in
advance for the lease period.

   Expatriates lament that the real cost of living is even
higher than surveys show. Monthly rent for a typical
five-bedroom house nearly tripled in the last year, to
$9,000, while consumer-goods prices jumped 20%, says the
American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul. As for office help, an
entry-level bilingual employee can command about $30,000 at a
foreign bank. Office space costs about $36 a square foot --
about half Tokyo rates -- but decent space is scarce.
   One bargain: public transport. Seoul taxis charge a $1
initial meter rate, and the subway costs only 27 cents.

   KOREA DISSIPATES good will on trade, U.S. and European
officials say.
   It is backtracking again on promises to open markets after
escaping designation as an unfair trading partner by the U.S.
last spring. Trade "is headed for a slugfest," says one U.S.
official. The government here delays broad tariff cuts,
citing "weak" economic growth of 10% this year. And with
local farmers fighting import liberalization, Korea feels it
has little room for concessions on food. Disputes over
telecommunications, cigarettes, and intellectual property
also fester.
   Europeans fare no better. Angered by an anti-import
campaign, they want, among other things, an easing of
discriminatory taxes of more than 100% on their wines and
liquors. Meanwhile, British Ambassador David Wright does his
best for England with a garden party to promote Jaguars.
Imported cars carry a hefty new $4,000 tax, in addition to
other taxes that multiply their cost.
                                                                                                       

   RISK CAPITAL: Korea suffers the highest rate of industrial
accidents.
   Two out of every 100 mine and factory workers were injured
last year; 26 out of every 100,000 were killed. In the first
half of 1990, the death rate jumped 43%, while the accident
rate rose about 3%. And government figures show that 20% of
the nation's workers have suffered an accident. Part of the
reason: a rush to produce more goods. Cho Sung Oh, director
of the government's plant safety programs, admits: "Our
safety technique isn't as advanced as our increasing
productivity rate."
   Unions, outlawed until 1987 and previously concentrating
on wages, now begin focusing on safety. Hyundai Motor's
union, the nation's richest, recently initiated the first
company-sponsored safety survey. But government efforts to
educate laborers fall flat. Many refuse welding masks or hard
hats as unmanly.
   Meanwhile, each of the government's 211 safety inspectors
must check about 560 factories.
                                                                                                       

   THE NAME'S THE SAME: 36% of Korean families are either Kim
or Lee. Top law firms include Shin & Kim; Kim, Shin & Yu; Kim
& Chang; Kim, Chang & Lee; Bae, Kim & Lee; and Lee &amp; Ko.
                                                                                                       

   SHEEPSKINS, BUT NO JOBS. The unemployment rate for college
graduates in Korea is double the general 2.6% rate. The
country needs scientists and technicians, but colleges crank
out liberal-arts majors. More than 30% of 1988 graduates are
jobless.
                                                                                                       

   TAP WATER is polluted with bacteria and heavy metals, the
government says. Yet it outlaws sales of bottled water to
natives; only foreign residents can buy it. Nine Korean
bottlers sue on constitutional grounds. The U.S. Embassy says
pollution-control devices, for air, water and waste, are a
ripe market for American businesses.
                                                                                                       

   REUNIFICATION PROSPECTS vary, depending on who's
prognosticating.
   President Roh Tae Woo sees union with the Communist North
in five years; his economists are skeptical. "Up to now,
people are taking the issue emotionally, not practically,"
says Ko Il Dong, a researcher at the government-sponsored
Korea Development Institute. The South's per capita GNP of
about $5,000, at least five times higher than North Korea's,
would fall 25% upon reunification. In six years, when per
capita GNP is expected to be $10,000, it would be easier, the
government says.
   After watching the German example, technocrats in Seoul
are convinced the costs of merging with backward North Korea
would be onerous. "Economically speaking, it is a nightmare,"
says a top adviser to the president. Scholars here also point
out that West Germany knew what to expect, having met with
East German officials many times over the years. But the
belligerent Koreas have talked only a few times. "We need
five to 10 years, then we can prepare for reunification,"
says Yeon Ha Cheong of the Korea Development Institute.
   North Korea carries a hard-currency debt load of $5.2
billion, much of it going bad, which Mr. Yeon says the South
can't quickly absorb.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Electronics giant Samsung aims to advertise on
every airport luggage cart in the world; it stamps 31,005 so
far. . . . Korean women get an extra day off work each month,
known as M-day.
