   Less than a month after concluding a $65 million bank
bailout, Donald J. Trump returned to his bankers to seek a
delay in loan payments due on the Trump Shuttle airline.
   Mr. Trump and two aides met yesterday with officials from
Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, which issued the shuttle loan,
to ask the bank to restructure $245 million in debt payments
still due, saying soaring fuel costs and a soft Northeast
economy have made the airline unprofitable. The next payment,
about $1.1 million, is due in three weeks.

   A Citibank executive said the bank was scheduled to
communicate last night with about 20 banks that purchased
pieces of the shuttle loan and urge them to allow Mr. Trump
to defer interest and principal payments.
   "This isn't about being mad at Donald," said a Citibank
official. "We have to look at this and analyze it in an
unemotional manner."
   Should the participants not agree to go along with a
deferral of interest, Mr. Trump could lose control of the
shuttle, which he bought in 1989 while taking on $380 million
in debt. However, under Mr. Trump's multibank bailout
agreement, a default on the shuttle wouldn't necessarily
trigger a default of the entire agreement, which allows Mr.
Trump to defer interest on almost $1 billion of his $2
billion in bank debt. The accord doesn't cover $1.2 billion
of casino bonds that will most likely be restructured in the
coming months.
   Under the bank deal, Mr. Trump agreed to continue payments
on $245 million in debt issued by Citibank. An additional
$135 million unsecured loan from Citibank and participants
has already been deferred under the deal.
   While Mr. Trump probably will be able to meet the
forthcoming $1.1 million payment, he is not expected to be
able to keep up with the payments due in the next 12 months,
said Stephen Bollenbach, chief financial officer of the Trump
Organization. Those payments are expected to total about $30
million.
   "We don't owe a huge amount right now but we need to
maintain our ability to run the company," Mr. Bollenbach
said. In addition to Messrs. Bollenbach and Trump, Trump
Shuttle President Richard Cozzi attended the meeting with
Citibank officials.
   A Citibank official said last month's shuttle ridership
was off 16% from August 1989. In recent weeks, fuel costs
have risen to 95 cents a gallon from about 50 cents a gallon.
Trump executives are said to believe that matters will not
improve within the next few months.
   Convincing the participants in the bank loan to give Mr.
Trump more time may be difficult. Many of the banks were
reluctant to join August's bank bailout and did so only after
Trump officials assured them that their payments would
continue.
   "The ink isn't even dry yet on the last agreement," said
one individual from a Japanese bank that purchased a piece of
the shuttle loan. As of yesterday, that bank had not been
contacted either by Trump officials or by Citibank officials.
   Mr. Bollenbach said he was sympathetic with the banks'
unhappiness over recent developments. "The situation has
degenerated so quickly that what someone told them a month
ago looks silly by now," he said.
