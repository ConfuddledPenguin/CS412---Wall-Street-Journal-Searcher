   Northwest Airlines has received a cash infusion of $500
million from European aircraft maker Airbus Industrie and
U.S. engine maker General Electric Co. as it flies into a
tough earnings period sparked by the fuel crisis.
   Airbus arranged the loan after Northwest -- a unit of NWA
Inc., St. Paul, Minn. -- agreed to order an additional 75
A-320 aircraft manufactured by Airbus and take options on 30
more Airbus planes. A GE joint venture is supplying the
engines for those aircraft.

   Although Northwest is Airbus's largest U.S. customer, the
European company had faced stiff competition for the
Northwest order, valued at $4.6 billion, from Seattle
aircraft maker, Boeing Co. The cash arrangement may have
given Airbus an edge in the competition.
   Officials familiar with the transaction say Northwest
plans to use the loan to reduce the bank debt that resulted
from its acquisition last year by an investor group that
included Alfred A. Checchi and several other former Marriott
Corp. executives. The Checchi group borrowed about $3 billion
to purchase the airline and has $1.7 billion in bank debt
remaining.
   The new aircraft -- narrow-body twin-engine jets that seat
150 passengers -- will be paid for through the airline's
operating funds as they are delivered, persons familiar with
the transaction said.
   The loan reduces the chance that Northwest will face a
cash crunch as it weathers a period of sharply higher fuel
prices and soft domestic passenger traffic. The carrier
estimates its fuel bill this year could increase by $180
million.
   The cash infusion also gives Northwest a cushion as it
faces other potential financial hurdles. The carrier is
facing a Sept. 29 deadline from the Department of
Transportation to find a replacement for $225 million of a
$400 million equity investment from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
Northwest is also under pressure to buy back an $80 million
stake currently held by Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian
concern.
   Elders has been trying to sell the Northwest stake and
other assets to solve its own debt problems. Northwest could
use a portion of the Airbus-arranged loan to complete the
purchase of the Elders stake.
   The KLM situation is less pressing since the
transportation department is likely to grant Northwest an
extension for reducing the KLM investment to $175 million.
That would be the second extension the carrier has received.
The department ordered Northwest to alter the KLM investment
last year, citing rules about foreign control over U.S.
carriers.
   Northwest and GE declined to discuss the Airbus
transaction. However, Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus Industrie
of North America, confirmed Airbus arranged the loan with
Northwest during negotiations over the aircraft order.
   Mr. Boyd declined to say how much of the loan Airbus
provided and how much came from GE. Mr. Boyd said the new
A-320s and spare parts Northwest ordered will serve as
collateral for the loan, which is repayable after 1995. The
loan is believed to carry an interest rate of less than 10%.
   GE's involvement in the transaction is through CFM
International, a joint venture GE has with the French
aircraft engine concern, SNECMA. The GE engine order is
valued at $1.3 billion.
   The Airbus loan to Northwest could renew the debate among
U.S. aircraft manufacturers over whether their European rival
is using unfair inducements to gain a toehold in the U.S. The
U.S. aircraft market is dominated by Boeing and St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Mr. Boyd of Airbus said Boeing set a precedent for such
transactions when Boeing agreed in 1987 to invest $700
million in Chicago-based UAL Corp. to help United Airlines'
parent thwart a takeover attempt by its pilot union.
   "Airbus is operating in a purely commercial fashion. We've
not done a single thing where there was not already a
precedent," Mr. Boyd said.
   Spokesmen for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas both declined
to comment on the Airbus-Northwest arrangement.
   It could be difficult for the U.S. manufacturers to openly
criticize Airbus's move since the loan is a boon to
Northwest. The loan could help the carrier reduce its
acquisition debt to a point where it could refinance the
borrowing at a much lower interest rate. The Checchi group
currently pays an interest rate of about 10% on the debt.
   Refinancing the debt at a lower rate would give Northwest
a stronger balance sheet at a time when even the strongest
carriers are predicting lower earnings.
   Northwest earned its first profit since the Checchi
acquisition during this year's second quarter, when it had
net income of $59.6 million on revenue of $1.8 billion.
Higher fuel costs are expected to clobber earnings at
Northwest and most other airlines in the third quarter.
