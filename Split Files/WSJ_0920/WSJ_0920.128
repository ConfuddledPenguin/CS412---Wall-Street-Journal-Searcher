   Six months after rejecting a dissident group's $18.50 a
share, or $140.5 million, offer, Justin Industries Inc.
rejected a second offer from the group, this one for $18 a
share.
   In a letter sent yesterday to the dissidents, led by Perry
H. Sutherland of Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of
New York, Justin chairman John Justin said, "It should be
apparent to you that since the board has rejected your
previous proposal to consider $18.50 a share, there is even
less reason for the board to consider $18 a share."

   In their latest offer, made Friday in a letter to the
Justin board, the dissidents contended that Justin's planned
acquisition of Tony Lama Co., El Paso, Texas, which lost $1.8
million in 1989, had lowered the value of Justin.
   But in his response, Mr. Justin asserted that the planned
$9-a-share, or $18 million, acquisition of Tony Lama had
"substantially enhanced" the value of Justin, based in Fort
Worth, Texas. Both Justin and Tony Lama make boots, and
Justin also makes bricks and building materials.
   In the letter outlining their offer, the dissidents said
that if rejected, they would seek other strategies for
acquiring Justin, though they conceded that they had not yet
arranged financing for a takeover.
   Mr. Sutherland said he had no response to the rejection
letter.
