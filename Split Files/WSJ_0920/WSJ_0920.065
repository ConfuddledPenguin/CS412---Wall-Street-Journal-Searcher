   The Communist Party of the Soviet Union wasted the 20th
century trying to do the impossible -- organize production
without markets and private property. This ideological effort
has failed at great cost, and now pragmatic leaders are
attempting to create the conditions for economic success. One
such effort that has shown up lately in the news is the
"Shatalin Plan," a 500-day economic program to move the
Soviet Union toward capitalism.
   Mikhail Gorbachev originally wavered over the plan. But
the government of the Russian republic -- led by Boris
Yeltsin -- officially adopted the Shatalin Plan Sept. 11. Mr.
Gorbachev then submitted his own version of the Shatalin Plan
to the Supreme Soviet two days later. The revolution has
begun, and Mr. Gorbachev will have to run hard if he intends
to catch up. On Monday, he decided a national referendum
would be necessary on a crucial element of the program: land
ownership. The reformers interpret that move as an effort by
Mr. Gorbachev to stall implementation of the Shatalin Plan.

   The main news, though, is that reformers have run out of
patience. Economists such as Stanislav Shatalin and Nikolai
Petrakov -- two of the famed plan's contributors -- believe
that the economy is fading fast and that the result of
further procrastination will be death. New democratic
politicians, such as Boris Yeltsin, Moscow Mayor Gavriil
Popov and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, believe that Mr.
Gorbachev's vacillations are allowing Soviet ministries and
the Communist Party to conduct a de facto privatization in
their own behalf. Determined to prevent powerful vested
interests from plundering the economy, the reformers have
rallied around the Shatalin Plan.
   The lengthy program calls for privatization and market
prices and sets timetables. It is a remarkable document, but
suffers from a lack of details. Most important, the Shatalin
Plan does not say how privatization is to be achieved. It
makes it unclear what comes first, privatization or market
pricing -- decisions that also affect ruble convertibility.
   In part the lack of critical detail reflects a compelling
need to act. In part it reflects a genuine bewilderment about
how to proceed with privatization. Reformers realize that
without market prices and capital markets there is no basis
for valuation of state property. At what prices, then, are
assets to be sold? This problem leads many to conclude that
prices must first be freed in order to find out what things
are worth. De facto privatization does not face this problem,
because those who currently control state property are simply
claiming it and acting as owners.
   The reformers will have to borrow a leaf from their
opponents' book and assign property rights, because without
private property the market cannot value assets. Before
capital markets can form and price assets, property rights
will have to be given to the people. The reformers do not
understand this, and many are determined that property not be
given away. This mindset deprives the Shatalin Plan of a
means of implementation.
   The truth, of course, is that there cannot be markets
without private property. If prices are freed first, some
will rise and others fall. Unemployment or large deficits
would result from falling prices, and higher prices would
produce complaints of profiteering and upward adjustments in
the level of prices that would be mistaken for inflation.
Both would demand remedies and deflect attention from
privatization. Moreover, these "prices" would not be accurate
indications of asset values. In the absence of private
property, assets would not be free. The result would be
undervaluation of resources locked into low-value uses and
overvaluation of resources where prices are high.
   The only obvious way around this problem is to convert
Soviet firms into joint stock companies and issue shares. A
percentage of the shares must then be given away. Once
property is in private hands, prices can be freed, and
markets will establish values for the shares that have been
assigned -- thus creating a priced market for sale of
remaining shares.
   This approach also allows the reformers to fortify the
people with property prior to the new uncertainties of the
market. If I were one of the new politicians, I would rather
be able to tell the people that "the Communist Party is
stealing the property that I intend to give to you," and not
"the Communist Party is stealing the property that I intend
to sell to black market millionaires and foreigners."
   Reformers have not thought about giving property away,
because they are obsessed with the "ruble overhang." They
want to sell property in order to soak up the excess supply
of rubles, but this is a red herring -- no pun intended]
Subsidized prices must rise once they are freed, regardless
of the money supply. Moreover, all the property doesn't need
to be given away -- just some of it.
   There are two promising methods of giving property away,
and reformers should employ both. A portion of the shares of
individual firms should be assigned individually to managers
and workers, and a portion should be assigned to a mutual or
social fund that, in turn, issues shares assigned
individually and equally to the population. Of the remaining
shares, a percentage could be sold to Soviet and foreign
investors, and a percentage could be assigned to government
(in the form of nonvoting shares or bond equivalents) to
provide revenues in lieu of income taxation.
   Without a scheme along these lines, the Shatalin Plan
lacks a political program and a means of implementation.
Distribution of shares would accomplish many goals. For
example, a relatively large percentage could be assigned to
the social fund, and a portion of that could be made a
mandatory holding so that each individual would have his or
her own social insurance, safety net, and retirement system.
This would remove the terror much of the population has of
market pricing. Changes in the level and relation of prices
would be reflected in share values and earnings. The social
fund would provide a cushion to protect the population from
inflation and unemployment. Losses and gains would be widely
distributed and equally shared through the social fund.
   Sales to foreigners attract talent and foreign exchange.
Sales to Soviet citizens accommodate those who have
accumulated wealth and financial balances from the exercise
of de facto property rights.
   This approach automatically solves the problem of ruble
convertibility. The ruble will become convertible once it can
purchase capital. Until individuals can use the ruble to buy
property, it has no basis for conversion into other
currencies. Linking the ruble to a commodity such as gold
before privatization would result in flight from rubles to
gold. It is the capability of a currency to purchase
productive assets that gives it value.
   The Shatalin Plan gives the republic governments sway over
the privatization of property, and this has been its main
sticking point with Mr. Gorbachev. He recognizes that, in
effect, the plan puts the Soviet government out of business.
If Mr. Gorbachev had moved quickly, he could have privatized
on an all-union basis and strengthened the Soviet Union
against the disintegration that is now taking place. By
hesitating, Mr. Gorbachev lost the initiative and may no
longer have the power to govern the republics. His referendum
is an attempt to hold onto that power.
   In the Soviet Union privatization is no longer the
question. What remains to be determined is whether the de
facto privatizations that are occurring will be replaced with
a plan based in law. If democratically elected politicians
permit powerful interests to plunder the country, they will
be discredited. Rising anger could plunge the country into
bloodshed.
