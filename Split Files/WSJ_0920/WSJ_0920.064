   IVREA, Italy -- Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. is planning to cut
several thousand jobs, in addition to reductions announced
earlier this year, as the company grapples with the effects
of the slowdown in demand in the computer industry and the
weak dollar, Managing Director Vittorio Cassoni said.
   Despite winning a larger slice of the European personal
computer market in this year's second quarter, the company
has been pressured to streamline by a squeeze on profit
margins caused by fierce competition.

   Revenue increased about 6% in the first half from 3.94
trillion lire ($3.39 billion) in the year-earlier period. But
despite this performance and success in holding down overall
costs, further slimming will be needed, Mr. Cassoni said.
   "We are definitely growing faster than the industry,
certainly faster than the European industry . . . in terms of
revenue," he said. Excluding the effects of exchange-rate
fluctuations, revenue grew 8.7%.
   Olivetti said revenues at the top 20 U.S. computer
companies increased 7.4% in the first half, a figure closer
to 4% once exchange-rate factors were excluded. The figure
also compares with declining, or only slightly growing,
revenues at Olivetti's major European competitors.
   Mr. Cassoni wouldn't discuss the company's profit
performance, because the board is set to meet next week to
review and announce results for the half. Analysts, however,
are pessimistic about Olivetti's profit outlook, and group
Chairman Carlo De Benedetti warned shareholders in June that
1990 would be a tough year. The group has seen net profit
slide to 202.8 billion lire last year from 356.2 billion lire
in 1988, 402 billion lire in 1987, and 565.5 billion lire in
1986.
   "Olivetti is doing well relative to our competition in an
environment that is worsening," Mr. Cassoni said. "That said,
we are not done with the streamlining of our operations." He
said that the process of cutting back, which the company had
expected to complete this year, will have to be continued in
1991.
   The company is planning to shed "a few more thousand" jobs
next year, in addition to the 3,500 jobs being cut this year
from the work force of 57,000 on Jan. 1. Those cuts will come
on top of more than 2,000 jobs cut in 1989; so far all
reductions have been through voluntary methods.
   One reason Olivetti has been particularly hit in the U.S.
is its emphasis on bank automation systems. Last year,
Olivetti bought ISC Systems Corp. of Spokane, Wash., merging
it with the company's Bunker Ramo Corp. unit.
   The move made bank automation Olivetti's biggest single
U.S. business, ahead of sales of office equipment and
personal computers. But the U.S. economic slowdown, coupled
with the crisis in the savings-and-loan industry, has hurt
business.
   Nevertheless, Olivetti has no plans to radically revise
its business approach in the U.S. "Banking is the single most
important vertical market for Olivetti . . . we're not going
to review that strategy," Mr. Cassoni said.
