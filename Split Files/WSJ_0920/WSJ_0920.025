   TULSA, Okla. -- Kinark Corp. said that its board
terminated the company's shareholder rights plan.
   The board also ordered the redemption of all outstanding
common stock-purchase rights issued pursuant to the plan and
held by shareholders of record at the close of business Oct.
15, at one cent per right, payable in cash Nov. 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rights were issued in December 1989 to fend off a
takeover attempt.
   Kinark is a chemical and steel galvanizing concern.
