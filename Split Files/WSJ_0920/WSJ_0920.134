   POSITION WANTED: Super-healthy college graduate,
powerfully motivated, highly competitive, totally
inexperienced, seeks executive post. Will require minimum
three months' time off for athletic pursuits.
                                                                                                       

   A WANT AD LIKE THAT SOUNDS like an adolescent pipe dream
but it fits any American hoping to compete in the Olympic
Games. The average age of a U.S. team member is now a mature
25 years and training expenses for a shot at the gold can hit
$40,000 a year. Unlike state-supported foreign competitors,
most U.S. athletes foot their own bills. Now Ernst &amp; Young, a
$2 billion auditing and consulting firm, is putting them in
the starting blocks.
   In 1977, the U.S. Olympic Committee set up its Olympic Job
Opportunity Program and by 1984 had put 276 athletes on
career paths. That year, Ernst &amp; Young, which handled scoring
for the Los Angeles Games, volunteered to help. By 1988, the
firm had placed 162 more athletes. Since September 1989, 164
Olympic strivers have been placed, a year that topped any
previous non-Olympic year. By the time the 1992 Summer
Olympics start in Barcelona, Spain, Ernst &amp; Young hopes to
have 400 Olympians at work.
   James Taylor, Ernst &amp; Young's marketing director, runs the
placement program. The Olympians, he points out, are
incredibly efficient at sports but naive outside the arena.
To help place the 176 athletes now in the program, he is
using 500 volunteers from the firm's 25,000 employees.
"Mentors" in 28 offices go one-on-one with the athletes,
review their resumes, and use the firm's good offices to
match them with employers.
   Ed Brodie, a senior manager in the New York executive
search operation, has three Olympians on his string, a 1988
gold-winning sprinter and two top fencers. One, runner Andrew
Valman, is working at Eastman Kodak as a sales
representative. Mr. Brodie estimates that he puts in 10 to 20
hours a week on his volunteer job, an important consideration
in a profession that starts the meter when the phone rings.
   In Los Angeles, Elizabeth Hammond spends 25% of her time
on her nine charges. Her job, she says, is to "find a label"
for a candidate's skills. "The athletes," she says, "must
analyze themselves, something they are good at."
   The Olympians offer more than glamour and muscles, Mr.
Taylor points out. "Athletes learn from their failures," he
says, a valuable trait in any employee. The grueling
training, he adds, takes dedication, organization and staying
power, qualities most employers long for.
   Olympic rower Kevin Still, a bronze medalist in the 1988
Seoul Games, is on the fast track at New York insurance
broker Johnson &amp; Higgins in New York. "These guys are our
future," says J&amp;H director Norman Barham. Kayaker Mike
Herbert of Arkansas got to the 1988 Olympics because of his
job at J.C. Penney; the company has hired 27 other athletes
through the OJOP program. "I couldn't have done it without
their help," Mr. Herbert says. Anheuser-Busch has taken on 50
Olympians over the years and vice president Jack McDonald
says "everyone's a winner" in the program.
   What does Ernst &amp; Young get out of all this? The tangibles
are publicity, special invitations to U.S. Olympic Committee
events and the right to put a special torch-and-Olympic-ring
symbol on the company's stationery. But the real plus is the
satisfaction of knowing that the firm is finding post-Olympic
careers for the best amateur athletes in the U.S.
