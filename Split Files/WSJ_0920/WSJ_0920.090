   Clothestime Inc. said that profit in fiscal 1991 will be
at the low end of analysts' forecasts and announced top
management changes, including the "retirement" of company
co-founder Michael DeAngelo.
   Mr. DeAngelo, 41 years old, had been chairman and chief
executive officer of the Anaheim, Calif., retailer for most
of the time since he, his father August, his brother Raymond,
and John Ortega founded the company in the mid 1970s.

   Michael DeAngelo remains a director and will spend a
couple of days a week at Clothestime as a part-time employee.
Raymond DeAngelo, 38, succeeds his brother as chief
executive. He remains vice chairman. Mr. Ortega, 41, formerly
vice chairman, assumes the chairman post.
   John Shanklin, 50, resigned as chief financial officer to
pursue other interests, Clothestime said. He "has something
lined up in a better capacity at another company," said David
Sejpal, corporate controller and acting financial officer.
Mr. Shanklin was on vacation and couldn't be reached.
   Mr. Sejpal said that Michael DeAngelo retired to spend
more time with his family. "He started working in flea
markets when he was 19 -- he hasn't taken many vacations and
he's tired." Mr. DeAngelo wasn't in the office yesterday and
didn't respond to a request for an interview.
   Mr. DeAngelo's retirement wasn't prompted by criticism of
his recent company stock sales, Mr. Sejpal said. "In
hindsight, it appears that Mike was planning his retirement
and was liquidating his founder's stock." Mr. Sejpal said he
wasn't aware of any investigations of the stock sales.
   The executive sold almost 60% of his holdings in the
company for $2 to $3.75 apiece between July 23 and
mid-September. Between October and December last year he sold
763,467 shares at $4.75 to $9.38 apiece. The retailer's
shares have plummeted from a high of $13.875 late last year.
   Yesterday, Clothestime shares rose 12.5 cents to $2.125 in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Clothestime said it expects profit of one cent a share to
five cents a share in its fiscal year ending Jan. 26. In
fiscal 1990, the company posted net income of $461,000, or
three cents a share.
   Mr. Sejpal said the company's new forecast allows for the
possibility of a small second-half loss. For the six months
ended July 28, Clothestime reported net income of $100,000,
or one cent a share.
   "Half way through (the third quarter), so far we are
looking at a slight profit," Mr. Sejpal said.
   Clothestime cited stiffer competition and a recent
slowdown in consumer spending. Clothestime and some other
discount retailers have been squeezed as department stores
cut prices. Clothestime is "downscaling" its merchandise
somewhat to attact customers who want lower prices, Mr.
Sejpal said. With $10 million in cash or cash equivalents,
the company is financially strong, he added.
