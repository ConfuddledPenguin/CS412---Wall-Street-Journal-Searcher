   NEW YORK -- Jitters about the economy wiped out a meek
rally in over-the-counter stocks and bruised the shares of
yet another newly public company.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index ended down 0.53 at 371.68, a
0.1% loss, after staging a brief rally in the first hour of
trading. Volume rose to 120.9 million shares from 115.1
million Tuesday. Declining shares outpaced decliners, 936 to
870, as 143 stocks fell to new lows and 20 reached new highs.

   O'Charley's, a Nashville, Tenn., restaurant operator,
tumbled 1/2 to 5 on more than six times average volume after
analysts trimmed their earnings estimates for the company.
The operator of Southeastern restaurants went public in
mid-July at $9 a share. But now it is feeling the pinch of
higher food prices and slower business, according to Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons analyst Steve Rockwell, who as recently as
midAugust said the company's growth was on target.
   Alex. Brown was the lead underwriter for the IPO. J.C.
Bradford &amp; Co. and Morgan, Keegan &amp; Co. were co-managers.
Analysts at all three firms trimmed estimates for O'Charley's
yesterday, but maintain "buy" opinions on the stock.
   O'Charley's chief financial officer, Gregory Burns, told
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that general economic
concerns have hurt the stock. If the economy strengthens in
the fourth quarter, then the company could earn 50 to 55
cents a share for the year, Mr. Burns said. Otherwise, higher
operating costs will make it hard to achieve that goal, he
said. However, both Mr. Burns and Mr. Rockwell said they're
convinced the company is positioned well for future growth.
   The nation's budget deficit is fast replacing Middle East
tensions as the chief concern of stock investors now, said
Jeremiah Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter
Reynolds, New York. Small investors have disappeared from the
market and institutions continue to be very picky, he said.
The remainder of the week should be slow, he added.
   Grant-Norpac, a Houston oil-service company, made its
debut with an initial offering of four million shares priced
at 10 1/4. The stock rose 1/2 to close at 10 3/4 on 1.1
million shares.
   Apple Computer fell 7/8 to 32 1/2 after the Cupertino,
Calif., computer maker said that shipments of its System 7.0
software will be delayed until the first half of 1991. More
than 1.6 million shares changed hands, making Apple the day's
third-most active OTC stock.
   Investors favored some other technology issues. Oracle
Systems, the day's most-active stock, edged up 1/8 to 7 1/4;
Intel rose 3/8 to 33 7/8; 3Com added 5/8 to 7 3/4; and Conner
Peripherals climbed 3/4 to 21 5/8.
   MIPS Computer Systems, which posted an all-time low
Tuesday, jumped 1 1/8 after Alex. Brown &amp; Sons analyst Mark
D. Stahlman upgraded his investment opinion on the stock to a
"buy" from a "hold."
   Centocor jumped 2 to 41 3/4. PaineWebber analyst Linda
Miller told investors she learned the military has asked for
supplies of Centoxin, the biotechnology company's product for
the treatment of septic shock, for possible use in the Middle
East. Although federal regulators haven't approved the
product for commercial marketing, Ms. Miller said she doesn't
believe this prohibits the military from using it. Centocor
confirmed it has had talked with the military, but wouldn't
elaborate.
   Grossman's advanced 5/8 to 3 5/8 on more than three times
average volume. After the market closed, the Braintree,
Mass., building-materials company said its board authorized
the buy-back of up to $2 million of its 26 million shares.
Grossman's, which also hired McKinsey &amp; Co. to help boost
stockholder value, is fighting a move by two real estate
investors to replace its board.
   Advance Ross, which holds 13.7% of NaTec Resources' shares
outstanding, jumped 1 1/2 to 11 1/4 after NaTec said it
agreed to acquire the metal-fabrication concern in a
stock-swap. Houston-based NaTec, a pollution-control company,
eased 1/8 to 4 1/4. Advance Ross said Tuesday that it hired
an investment firm to explore ways to enhance shareholder
value.
   The American Depositary Receipts of Reuters Holdings
tumbled 2 1/8 to 43 1/2 on more than one million issues.
Reuters Ltd., the trading subsidiary of the London news and
information services concern, said it bought UpLink Ltd., a
specialized satellite service operator.
   ViCorp Restaurants and SciMed Life Systems fell after
"sell" recommendations on both stocks were issued throughout
the week by Stan Weinstein, editor and publisher of The
Professional Tape Reader, Hollywood, Fla. Mr. Weinstein said
in an interview that he isn't aware of any fundamental
problems with either company.
   But he recommended investors sell the stocks based on a
technical analysis indicating that both shares have become
pricey relative to the market and are vulnerable to
profit-taking. ViCorp, he noted, is in the lagging restaurant
sector. ViCorp fell 2 to 17 1/4 and SciMed Life Systems
tumbled 2 1/4 to 28 1/4.
   Oil-Dri Corp. of America's Class A shares slipped 1 3/8 to
20 7/8. Shortly before the market closed, the maker of cat
litter reported that net income for the fourth quarter ended
July 31 rose to 25 cents a share from 18 cents. Profit thus
was slightly below one analyst's estimate of 28 cents
reported by First Call, a unit of Thomson Financial Networks.
Oil-Dri's full-year earnings of $1 a share were only one cent
shy of an analyst's estimate.
   Shares of several companies that reported bad news earlier
this week continued to slide. Stokely USA, which expects a
drop in fiscal second-quarter earnings, tumbled 2 1/8 to 10
7/8 after Tuesday's 3 1/8-point drop. The stock's 52-week
high was 24.
   G-III Apparel slid 1 1/4 to a new 52-week low 5 3/4, well
below its 52-week high of 21 1/4. Monday, the New York
retailer said that two class-action suits were filed against
it alleging certain securities laws violations.
   Shares of two northeastern financial institutions extended
their losses. Hamptons Bancshares dropped 3/4 to 6 1/4.
Monday, the Southampton, N.Y., financial institution said it
temporarily suspended its quarterly dividend. Newmil Bancorp
of New Milford, Conn., fell 1/2 to 2 1/2. Tuesday, Newmil
said that an extraordinary provision for loan losses will
eliminate its earnings for the first quarter ending Sept. 30.
Newmil also suspended its quarterly dividend of 15 cents a
share.
   Occupational-Urgent Care Health skidded 1 1/4 to 18 3/4
after Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Dirk Godsey cut his earnings
estimates for the Sacramento, Calif., company. Mr. Godsey
maintains a "buy" opinion on the provider of medical cost
containment and managed care programs, but lowered his third-
and fourth-quarter earnings estimates.
