   Facing fewer orders and declining profits, Vitalink
Communications Corp. said it laid off 10% of its work force,
or 32 employees, and cut back the number of its sales
offices.
   In the last six months, the Fremont, Calif., company has
weathered a series of setbacks: First, it had to reduce
prices on some hardware products by 15%, then its chief
executive officer resigned, and net income in the last
quarter plunged 50% from the previous year.

   Vitalink's current chief executive, Donald J. Herman, said
that with the savings from firing employees, the company
would invest more heavily in developing new products.
   Vitalink makes systems used to connect large computer
networks.
