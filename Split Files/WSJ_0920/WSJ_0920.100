   Allergan Inc. said it will close its contact lens
manufacturing facility in Woodbury, N.Y., over the next year
and lay off 70 employees.
   The Irvine, Calif., maker of eye and skin-care products
said it will transfer the operations to Allergan facilities
in Irvine and in Waco, Texas. The company consolidated its
manufacturing operations in Europe into one plant in Britain
last year.

   Allergan said the move is part of its effort to streamline
operations. Last January, the company announced a
restructuring plan under which it would reduce its work
force, consolidate certain manufacturing operations and
curtail businesses that were marginally profitable.
