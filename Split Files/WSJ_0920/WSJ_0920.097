   This week's primaries have identified the most explosive
issue in this fall's election: the war on incumbents. As the
saying goes, the voters are mad as hell, and aren't going to
take it anymore.
   We suspect the anti-establishment vote just recorded in
Massachusetts is going to get most of the attention, but for
a more revealing look at what may lie ahead, check out
Oklahoma. Oklahoma has become the first state to vote to
limit the terms of its state legislators.

   Oklahoma's term-limitation initiative won more than 67% of
the vote, carrying every one of the state's 77 counties and
all demographic groups. It made the difference in the
come-from-behind victory of businessman David Walters in the
Democratic primary for Governor. Mr. Walters defeated Wes
Watkins, a seven-term Congressman, by running pro-term limit
commercials and declaring "it's time to reclaim our
government." Congressman Watkins didn't take a position on
term limits, leading us to wonder what might happen to
someone in Oklahoma who had actually crusaded against term
limitation. In the GOP primary, the candidate most strongly
in favor of term limits scored an upset victory.
   The Oklahoma initiative won wide bipartisan support. A key
backer was former State Rep. Cleta Deatherage Mitchell, who
chaired the Appropriations Committee before she retired from
politics. Ms. Mitchell, a self-described liberal Democrat,
says term limitation will be good for her party. "The
national Democratic Party doesn't understand America outside
the Beltway," she says. "I think term limitation is the only
way Democrats will survive long term. We either force new
blood into the party or we will be increasingly out of
touch."
   The Oklahoma initiative doesn't limit terms for Members of
Congress, but it serves as a rocket booster for term-limit
votes in Colorado and California this November. The Colorado
initiative also covers that state's congressional delegation.
Oklahoma supporters of term limits say they plan another
initiative extending term limits to Congress.
   In Massachusetts, the state's Democratic establishment is
still reeling from John Silber's landslide victory in the
Democratic gubernatorial primary over Francis Bellotti, a
30-year political insider and conventional liberal. Though no
conservative, Mr. Silber, the acerbic president of Boston
University, used his campaign to lambaste liberals and call
for wholesale change in government. So the same Massachusetts
party that nominated Michael Dukakis for Governor three times
has now chosen John Silber, who voted for Ronald Reagan and
George Bush for President.
   "There is no question this is a voter rebellion by
anybody's definition of the term," says former Massachusetts
Democratic Senator Paul Tsongas. Angry Democrats, furious at
their party's role in dragging the state into fiscal ruin,
also defeated Attorney General James Shannon and at least
eight state legislators.
   A new Times Mirror poll confirms what some of us have been
pointing at for some time now: Americans feel increasingly
disconnected from their government. The percentage of adults
who "agree completely" that politicians in Washington lose
touch with their constituents quickly has increased from 22%
in 1987 to more than 30% today. Exhibit A in this respect is
the Glass Cocoon budget summit in Washington, which persists
in believing that voters will support higher taxes to help
Washington get control of the federal budget. Democratic
candidates around the country know better.
   On taxes, Neil Hartigan, the Democratic candidate for
Governor in Illinois, is running to the right of his
Rockefeller Republican opponent, Jim Edgar. He pledges to
weed out marginal programs and not raise taxes. In New
Jersey, congressional candidate Marguerite Chandler is
fleeing from Jim Florio, her party's Governor. She's running
a radio ad in her House race denouncing the Florio tax
increases and saying "it's time to tell the Governor enough
is enough." In a Nebraska House race, State Senator Sandra
Scofield is touting her vote against a state tax increase
backed by her GOP opponent.
   With only seven weeks to go in the campaign, the White
House appears uninterested in helping discontented voters
find their way to candidates who would challenge the status
quo. The fact remains that voters are frustrated with
politicians who have cemented themselves into office with
incumbent-protections, and they are now willing to back term
limits -- a radical measure that is the equivalent of a
national vote of no-confidence. The political momentum of
this movement is now headed straight into November, and once
it's finished with that slate of candidates we suspect it'll
head for 1992.
