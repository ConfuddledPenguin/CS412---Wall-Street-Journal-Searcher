   BOSTON -- Hitachi Ltd. said its researchers developed a
compound that shows signs of superconductivity at a somewhat
higher temperature than previously reported for the
phenomenon.
   The new compound, unlike most "high-temperature"
superconductors developed during the past few years, doesn't
contain copper -- an aspect of the material that intrigues
superconductivity experts.

   They hope the new compound will provide clues about how to
make superconductors that work at yet higher and more cheaply
attained temperatures.
   Superconductors, which conduct electricity without
resistance when cooled, promise new electrical technologies,
such as faster computers and cheaper power generation.
   The Japanese concern said its new material contains the
elements thallium, strontium, vanadium and oxygen; the
company also reported fabricating a closely related
superconductor in which part of the strontium is replaced
with the element cerium.
   A sample of Hitachi's compound showed a sharp drop in
electrical resistance -- indicating superconductivity --
between 130 Kelvins and 160 Kelvins, or minus 225 degrees
Fahrenheit to minus 171 degrees Fahrenheit, Hitachi said.
Currently, the highest known temperature for
superconductivity is about 125 Kelvins, or minus 234 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   The finding hasn't yet been confirmed, and some scientists
said they were skeptical about it. During the past few years,
several research teams have reported similar
superconductivity temperature advances that apparently were
spurious.
