   LOS ANGELES -- Still unreleased reports that troubled
First Executive Corp. has been using for months to establish
the long-term financial strength of its insurance units
appear to fall short of the mark.
   The reports, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, were
done by Seattle-based actuarial consultants Milliman &amp;
Robertson Inc. and are based on computer analyses of detailed
financial information about Executive Life Insurance Co., Los
Angeles, and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, First
Executive's principal units.

   Two initial studies, dated Feb. 16 and March 6, are based
on conditions through December 1989. Excerpts were circulated
to Executive Life agents, policyholders and shareholders --
and even to a committee of Congress.
   A draft summary of a third report, which plugs in the
company's actual experience with record policy surrenders in
the first half and its financial condition as of June 30,
paints a somewhat harsher view of First Executive's future
earnings in about 10% of 78 scenarios drawn up by the
consultants. But they say the assumptions in the scenarios
"represent extremely unlikely economic conditions and
customer behavior."
   Still, the reports appear to have shortcomings that
several regulators say privately undercut their usefulness,
largely because they may make some of the findings
over-optimistic.
   "Assumptions can be made so tough that they'd imperil any
company," said Alan C. Snyder, president of First Executive.
"But we've tried to establish a range of assumptions that
deal with the real world." Mr. Snyder said the consultants
examined a wide range of interest rate assumptions, junk-bond
default rates higher than experienced by the market, and
policy surrenders at multiples of the company's current
experience. "And the company withstood all these tests," he
said.
   The outcomes in the first two studies portray financially
solid units, able to withstand insurance customers this year
redeeming as much as 50% of all the company's policies that
can be surrendered and a further 20% next year. Even under
such arduous scenarios, the reports say that the hypothetical
book values of the companies actually could increase over a
five-year test period.
   The update seeks to address some of the serious questions
the first two reports don't resolve. The initial reports'
most severe assumption of policy redemptions for 1990 was
nearly surpassed in the first six months of this year, when
redemptions and defaults totaled $2.65 billion. The update
starts with the higher actual surrender rates of the first
half, but assumes a more normal surrender rate by no later
than next June 30.
   Milliman &amp; Robertson's first report assumes that half of
all money from maturing investments is reinvested in junk
bonds. The assumption means higher bond yields that favorably
affect the study's conclusions, but that violates an
agreement between Executive Life and California insurance
regulators. The update assumes all new investments being
totally investment-grade.
   Another reinvestment assumption in the first two reports
analyzes annual junk-bond default rates to a maximum of 2%
and an investment return of five percentage points over
Treasury bill rates. The studies suggest that financial
results of the First Executive units are quite sensitive to
the rate of junk-bond defaults.
   The studies also assume that the death rate of Executive
Life's policyholders remains unchanged throughout the
analysis. However, insurance experts say that any analysis
should consider a phenomenon known as "adverse selection," in
which healthy policyholders may abandon an insurer because
they can easily obtain policies elsewhere, while medically
high-risk holders stick with the policies they have. Mr.
Snyder said that Executive Life policies have adjustable cost
features based on mortality experience.
   First Executive at first promised to publicly release the
updated report and the earlier studies at the end of August.
The company now says it plans the release soon.
   Joseph Belth, publisher of The Insurance Forum, a trade
publication, and a frequent critic of First Executive, had
been trying to obtain copies in court from New York insurance
regulators under freedom of information legislation. First
Executive opposed Mr. Belth's efforts. But Mr. Belth obtained
copies of the first two reports independent of this newspaper
and called them "inconclusive" in his latest newsletter. "It
is my opinion the assumptions do not reflect various negative
developments that may occur," he said.
