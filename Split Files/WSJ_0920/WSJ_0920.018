   NEW YORK -- Investors continued to pour money into taxable
money-market mutual funds in the latest week.
   Assets of the 436 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report increased by $2.1 billion to a record $402
billion, the Holliston, Mass., newsletter reported. The
average seven-day compound yield, which assumes reinvestment
of dividends, dropped to 7.74% in the week ended Tuesday from
7.75%.

   "We think investors are continuing to put money into money
funds to avoid turmoil in the stock and bond markets," said
Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's.
   Average maturity of the investments in the funds'
portfolios fell by one day, to 46 days. The funds invest in
such things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
dropped to 7.46% from 7.47%. The average 30-day simple yield
slipped to 7.47% from 7.48% and the average 30-day compound
yield eased to 7.75% from 7.76%.
   Assets of 232 tax-free funds fell by $308.1 million, to
$80.9 billion, Donoghue's reported. The average seven-day
compound yield rose to 5.56% from 5.54%. The latest yield is
equal to a taxable yield of 7.72% for an investor in the 28%
tax bracket and 8.30% for someone paying 33% in taxes.
   The average maturity of the tax-exempt funds rose by one
day, to 59 days.
