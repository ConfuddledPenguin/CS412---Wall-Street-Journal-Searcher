   WASHINGTON -- The savings-and-loan bailout agency tallied
up its growing and increasingly complex funding needs,
prompting an election-year Congress to concoct new ideas for
paying the tab.
   In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee,
William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., said
the agency will have plowed through its original $50 billion
to cover S&amp;L losses by the end of the year, and will need at
least $30 billion to $40 billion more in the next fiscal year
to cover losses.

   On top of that, another $50 billion to $60 billion in
temporary cash will be required next year to manage assets of
S&amp;Ls seized by the government. The agency expects to recoup
those funds when it sells the assets. Furthermore, the agency
is seeking another $22 billion to defray costs of some 1988
government-assisted thrift sales, in hopes that these
expenditures could save $4 billion in the long run.
   In all, it means that for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1,
the S&amp;L cleanup agency will need roughly $122 billion in
funding, more than double what was anticipated a year ago.
Although the RTC has previously proposed the various
increases, Mr. Seidman's testimony was the first time the
agency has laid out a full package of additional funding.
   Mr. Seidman didn't sugarcoat the message to the
tax-writing committee. "Unfortunately, when it comes to loss
funds, there really are no alternatives," he said.
"Additional loss funds will have to come from the American
taxpayer."
   But several congressmen had other ideas. Rep. Paul
Kanjorsky (D., Pa.) proposed that oil companies pay as taxes
one-third of their earnings that have occurred since the day
that Iraq invaded Kuwait, curtailing the nation's oil supply.
He estimated that $15 billion might be raised.
   Other alternatives included taxing the S&amp;L industry, with
Rep. Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.) proposing closing two tax
loopholes for S&amp;Ls, and Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.)
suggesting a steep tax on buyers of insolvent S&amp;Ls. Rep.
Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) proposed surtaxes on unearned
income for wealthy individuals and corporations, and closing
a tax loophole that forgives taxes on appreciated capital
gains at death.
   None of the alternatives appears likely to be given
serious consideration before the congressional session ends
next month.
   The proposals underscored growing regional differences
arising over the S&amp;L cleanup, with Northeastern lawmakers
arguing that their region is paying for an economic bailout
of the Southwest. "My state got hit once," said Ms. Kennelly.
"We want to make sure a solution is found that doesn't hit us
a second time."
   Mr. Seidman also urged Congress to alter a provision in
last year's bailout law that limits the agency's borrowing
authority for temporary capital. He argued for raising the
limit, currently at 85% of the market value of the S&amp;L assets
it holds, to 100% of their value. With the agency holding
$165 billion in assets, removing that cap could free up an
additional $25 billion.
   The General Accounting Office, also testifying,
recommended that Congress quickly take that action, as well
as provide $50 billion to cover S&amp;L losses. It also urged
that the funding be included in the federal budget. "A
funding decision, whether short term or long term, must be
made soon," said Comptroller General Charles Bowsher.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, also increased
its estimate of the total costs to between $335 billion and
$370 billion, up from its earlier $235 billion, based on a
greater-than-expected number of S&amp;L failures and increased
costs for old S&amp;L sales.
