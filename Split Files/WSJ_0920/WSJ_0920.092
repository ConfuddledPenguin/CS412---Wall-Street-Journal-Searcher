   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- FarWest Financial Corp., buffeted
by recent losses and tough new regulatory capital standards,
said Fred Kayne resigned as president, chief executive
officer and a director.
   Mr. Kayne, a former Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. managing director
who has been president and chief executive of FarWest since
February 1988, said the decision wasn't related to FarWest's
problems. Rather, he cited the thrift-bailout law last year,
which greatly limited diversification opportunities for
thrifts and meant that "I could not be involved in expanding
the company."

   Mr. Kayne, who will continue as a part-time consultant,
said he plans to spend more time managing his own
investments.
   The S&amp;L holding company is controlled by the Belzberg
family of Canada, and William Belzberg will continue as
chairman. Mr. Kayne said he didn't know of any plans to name
a new president and chief executive to succeed him.
   FarWest reported a net loss of $3.7 million, or 47 cents a
share, for the second quarter. Last month, federal thrift
regulators subjected its FarWest Savings &amp; Loan Association
subsidiary to a number of operating restrictions after
rejecting a plan by the thrift to bring its capital levels
into compliance with regulatory standards.
   Among other factors, FarWest, a major junk-bond investor,
has been hurt in recent months by the declining junk-bond
market.
