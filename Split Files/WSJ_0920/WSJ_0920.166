   There's very little that's really new in "GoodFellas,"
Martin Scorsese's latest film, which is what makes this
gangster picture so astonishing. Like some half-mad visionary
who finds new magic every time he paces the same street, Mr.
Scorsese has made familiar territory seem thrilling and
dangerous all over again.
   He was inspired this time by "Wiseguy," Nicholas Pileggi's
sociological study of mobsters at work; the two men wrote the
screenplay together. And though the movie has a dramatic
structure and heart, it is in fact an ingenious bit of
sociology about the "good fellas" who are the organization
men of the Mafia infrastructure.

   The movie follows a group of them over a 30-year period,
starting in the mid-1950s. They have roughly the same
ambition and desire as other upwardly mobile Americans of
that generation. They speak with the vocabulary of the
streetwise businessman and are no more or less tacky in their
display of wealth than their nouveau-riche contemporaries.
   But while they indulge in the trappings of success --
flashy suits and expensive homes -- of the ordinary striver,
these men operate by a moral compass that makes perfect sense
within their universe and none at all anywhere else. They
live by a complex set of rules. Failing to show respect to a
group leader is unacceptable, murdering an old friend can be
acceptable, even mandatory.
   Mr. Scorsese gets at the romance of the life, and the
rottenness, and the absurdity, without mimicking either the
operatic style of "The Godfather" or the cartoonish
quirkiness of "Married to the Mob." Picturesque though they
may be, his wiseguys feel very real. These men are familiar;
little guys who make themselves feel big through their
acquisition of money and things and by the constant
celebration of what they've accomplished.
   The picture unrolls as a flashback, narrated by Henry Hill
(Ray Liotta). The first third of the picture does romanticize
the mobsters, as the young Henry recalls his infatuation with
these men who seemed so great because they could get things
done. So, for example, when Henry's parents objected to his
missing school to run errands for the local Mafia boss,
Henry's new friends urge the mailman not to deliver the
truancy slips. Henry was aware that they convinced the
mailman by beating him pulpy, but he was young and too
infatuated to think or care about the violence.
   Or maybe Henry and the bad men he gravitated toward were
born without whatever it is that allows most of us to learn
to feel bad when people are brutalized. "I always wanted to
be a gangster," says Henry, right at the beginning, in the
wistful tone of the professional baseball player recalling
how he got started.
   Mr. Scorsese stages Henry's recollection of the early
years with playful poignancy -- interrupted by the flashes of
violence that were an ordinary part of Henry's life. He
sustains the mood with a backdrop of period rock 'n roll
music and with freeze frames that lock in Henry's memory of
this period the way snapshots form the basis of a family's
remembered history.
   When the young Henry (Christopher Serrone) sets a building
on fire and runs away from the explosive flare, Mr. Scorsese
stops the camera on this image of exhilaration, the boy's
arms stretched out in pure joy at his own anarchy, and power.
   Yet the film doesn't glorify the gangsters or make their
outbursts of violence seem anything less than shocking and
horrible. As Henry grows up and becomes an entrenched part of
the gang, the picture changes tone. Henry's still able to
persuade himself that it's all a kick, but he's now aware
that there can be personal danger in the trigger temper of
Tommy (Joe Pesci), and that his "family" will be no more
loyal to him than its men are to their wives (Saturday night
is for wives; Friday night for girlfriends). Even his smooth
friend Jimmy (Robert De Niro), could one day be the one to
whack him.
   Henry starts to share the narration with Karen (Lorraine
Bracco), the suburban Jewish girl who was drawn to Henry for
the same reasons he was drawn to the mob: He was exciting and
dangerous and would make life an ongoing drama. He could get
a table at the Copacabana without reservations, and Bobby
Vinton knew him personally. Without making a big deal of it
Mr. Scorsese slyly stocks the atmosphere with such period
pieces as Henny Youngman, Jerry Vale and Bobby Vinton Jr.
(standing in for his father).
   The picture changes pace again in the third act, as Henry
spins off from his pals and starts taking the drugs he's
dealing. Though Mr. Scorsese hasn't set things up for a big
message, or catharsis, he creates the sense of frenzied
hopelessness that will eventually destroy the life Henry's
bought into, and perhaps worse for him, the mythology he's
created. In the end, the glamour that drew him in seems
pitiable, and it is gone.
   Mr. Scorsese tells his tale swiftly and fluidly, with
characterizations that are beautifully played and never
predictable. Who else would think of showing the mob boss
Paulie (Paul Sorvino) concentrating on slicing garlic thinly
as he waits out his time in prison, organizing perfect meals?

   VIDEO TIP: The fierce humor and originality of
"GoodFellas" is especially impressive if you consider how
tempting it is in these days of multimillion-dollar contracts
for a successful director to play it safe. Though one could
argue that all Scorsese films are the same, one could just as
easily argue that no two are alike. Sometimes they're almost
too powerful to watch ("Raging Bull"), but they're always
amazing. Compare "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" with "New
York, New York" and "Taxi Driver" or "The Last Temptation of
Christ." Then, if you think one person couldn't stretch
himself any further, rent the rest.
