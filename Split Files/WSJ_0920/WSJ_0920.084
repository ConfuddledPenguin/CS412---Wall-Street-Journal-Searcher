   In your Aug. 17 page-one article "Comeback Story: Reborn
Ohio Industry Is Clean, High-Tech and Shock-Absorbent," the
idea that "Manufacturing has come roaring back" seems overly
optimistic, when one checks the official figures. According
to the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Commerce
Department, in 1969 Ohio ranked 15th among the states in
per-capita personal income. By 1988 -- the latest year for
which comparable figures are available -- Ohio's rank was
down to 24th. The bureau projected a further drop to 25 by
the year 2000.
   Over a period of decades Ohio has been gaining in low-wage
and part-time jobs, while losing many thousands of high-wage,
full-time jobs. In 1969, for example, employment in
manufacturing industries in Ohio averaged 1,471,000. By 1989
that level had dropped to 1,123,000 -- a loss of 348,000
jobs.

   Production workers in Ohio manufacturing industries
averaged $523 a week in 1989. Had the 1969 level of factory
employment been achieved in 1989, personal income of Ohioans
would have been greater by at least $10 billion.
