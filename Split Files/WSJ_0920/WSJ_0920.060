   WASHINGTON -- Less than a month after Saddam Hussein had a
British-based journalist hanged as a spy, Sen. Alan Simpson
was assuring the Iraqi dictator that his problems weren't
with the U.S. government but with "the Western media."
   In the meeting in Baghdad last April, the Wyoming
Republican and other U.S. lawmakers didn't raise the subject
of the journalist's hanging. Sen. Simpson said in an
interview yesterday that he recalls some references by Saddam
Hussein to an Iranian spy being hanged.

   But Mr. Simpson in April suggested that the Iraqi leader
should get to know the press better to clear up his image
problems, and the senator also offered his own view of
reporters: "It is a haughty and pampered press," he said.
"They all consider themselves political geniuses. . . . They
are very cynical."
   Sen. Simpson's comments are similar to others made shortly
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait that, at least in
retrospect, appear to have given Saddam Hussein the
impression that his aggressive behavior wasn't creating
serious problems with the U.S. For instance, only weeks
before the Aug. 2 invasion, Ambassador April Glaspie,
reflecting U.S. policy, told Saddam Hussein that the U.S.
strongly opposed an expansion of sanctions against Iraq and
also wouldn't get involved in Arab disputes. The same points
were made in congressional testimony by John Kelly, assistant
secretary of state for Mideast affairs.
   A transcript of Sen. Simpson's meeting with Saddam Hussein
was provided by the Iraqi embassy here. It also appeared
earlier in Spy magazine, a New York-based satirical
publication. In the interview yesterday, Sen. Simpson
confirmed its accuracy. He said Saddam Hussein was
complaining about news reports that he had biological
weapons, which the Iraqi leader denied, and Mr. Simpson
suggested that Iraq invite Western reporters in to see for
themselves.
   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who also
was on the trip, suggested letting Western reporters visit
sites alleged to house biological-weapons facilities. "At
that point," Sen. Dole said, "they cannot do anything but
tell the truth."
   Sen. Simpson said yesterday that he didn't believe the
comments by lawmakers were misconstrued by the Iraqi leader.
"There wasn't anything to be misconstrued. He was tough,
smooth, rugged, unblinking. He lied to us. What's new?"
   But apparently Saddam Hussein impressed at least one
member of the U.S. delegation. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,
Ohio) told the Iraqi leader toward the end of the session, "I
am now aware that you are a strong and intelligent man, and
that you want peace." Sen. Metzenbaum also provides one of
the lighter moments in the transcript. Offering his own media
advice, Sen. Metzenbaum suggested that Saddam Hussein would
improve his image by focusing more on peace. But Sen.
Metzenbaum, saying that he is Jewish, adds later, "I am not
the right person to be your public-relations man."
   Sen. Simpson said yesterday that the mission to Baghdad to
discuss peace with Saddam Hussein had been a major success.
"If we had not been over there working for peace, we might
not enjoy the world support the way we do now," he said. "We
might not have the Arabs on our side. Maybe our visit did
that."
