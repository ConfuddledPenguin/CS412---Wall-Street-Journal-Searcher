   DENVER -- Bayly Corp. said its president, Everett G.
Warren, had assumed the additional post of chief executive
officer. The position was previously held by George K.
Hansen, who remains chairman, the company said.
   "The board of directors chose to make a change," David
Houseman, Bayly chief financial officer, said of the action.
Mr. Hansen could not be reached for comment.

   In a prepared release, the apparel manufacturer said the
change was part of a realignment of executive
responsibilities begun Feb. 1 when Mr. Warren was brought
into Bayly as president and chief operating officer.
   Last week, the company announced a widened net loss of
$4.2 million, or $1.97 per share, on revenue of $12 million
for the quarter ended July. 31. In the year-earlier period,
Bayly reported a net loss of $974,000, or 42 cents a share,
on revenue of $20.3 million.
