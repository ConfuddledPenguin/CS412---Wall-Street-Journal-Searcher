   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Pitney Bowes Inc. said it is scrapping
its remanufactured copier business, which will result in a
one-time pretax charge of $86 million in the third quarter.
   The hefty charge -- 68 cents a share after taxes -- could
mean the company will report earnings of about 10 cents a
share based on analysts' estimates it would have earned 78
cents a share without the charge. As a result, Pitney also
said it expects lower net income for the year.

   In 1989, Pitney earned $252.8 million, or $3.08 a share,
on revenue of $2.88 billion. In the year-ago third quarter,
it earned $62 million, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of
$711.9 million. The quarter included income from discontinued
operations of $2.6 million, or three cents a share.
   The announcement yesterday battered Pitney Bowes shares,
which slid $4.125 to close at $30.125 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Investors said they were surprised by the size of the
write-off, but Chairman George B. Harvey said investors "may
not yet fully appreciate the benefits of the action."
   Some analysts said the stock price decline might have been
an "overreaction" to news they believed was positive in the
long term for the company. "They're eliminating one of the
problems that have hurt earnings," said Alex Henderson, of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Indeed, the remanufacturing segment has been a drag on its
copier business, which generates about 10%, or $300 million,
of annual revenue for the company. The business takes rental
copiers that have been returned and remanufactures them, and
they are rented again at a discount. But that created
inventory problems and profit margins were lower than if the
company were to rent higher-margin copiers to businesses.
   "Margins on remanufactured copiers are low and, by
focusing our sales and service efforts on new and higher
value products, we believe we can improve our gross margins
and enhance our after-market supplies and service revenue,"
said Mr. Harvey.
