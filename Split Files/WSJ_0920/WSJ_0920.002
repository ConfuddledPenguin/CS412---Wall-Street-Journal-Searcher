   FORD MOTOR Co. (Dearborn, Mich.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it has placed about $5.2 billion in
securities issued by this auto maker's finance arm under
review for a possible ratings downgrade. The move follows
Tuesday's announcement that Moody's is reviewing the ratings
of $40 billion in Ford debt for possible downgrade in the
wake of weak U.S. car sales. A Ford spokesman said yesterday
that the company believes both actions are unwarranted.
