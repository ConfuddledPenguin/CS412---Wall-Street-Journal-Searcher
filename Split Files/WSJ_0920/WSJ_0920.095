   THE U.S. MILITARY IS PUSHING to keep troops permanently in
Saudi Arabia.
   According to senior military officers, the Army and Air
Force are quietly drafting the long-term strategy, involving
10,000 troops, as well as plans for securing air bases
throughout the Persian Gulf after the current crisis ends.
But civilian officials at the Pentagon denied that there is
such a policy, presaging a possible internal feud. Meanwhile,
Iraq said it is confiscating assets of nations participating
in economic sanctions against Baghdad. U.S. officials didn't
have any immediate estimate of the value of American assets
involved, but it probably isn't great.
