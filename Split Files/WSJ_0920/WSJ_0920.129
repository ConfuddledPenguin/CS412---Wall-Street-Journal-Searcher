   Valhi Inc. and NL Industries Inc., two companies
controlled by Dallas financier Harold Simmons, said they had
entered into a definitive agreement on a previously announced
plan to merge. Under the plan, Valhi, a chemical and
industrial concern that currently holds about 66% of NL,
would acquire the remaining equity in the petroleum services
concern in a transaction valued at $411 million.
   The companies said the merger will not be completed if the
average price of Valhi common shares stays below $9.50 a
share for the 20 trading days ending two trading days before
a shareholder vote on the proposal. Valhi can terminate the
merger if its average price for the same period is above $13
a share.

   Consummation of the merger is subject to, among other
things, approval by Valhi's shareholders and approval by a
majority of NL shares present and voting, other than those
held by Valhi. Both the NL and Valhi boards have already
approved the merger agreement, the companies said in a joint
statement.
   The companies said they expect to mail a joint proxy
statement to shareholders in late October and that their
respective meetings of shareholders, called to consider the
transaction, would probably be held in December.
