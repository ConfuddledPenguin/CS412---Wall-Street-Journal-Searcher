   HOUSTON -- NaTec Resources Inc. said it offered to acquire
Advance Ross Corp., Chicago, through a stock swap. Although
an exchange ratio hasn't been determined, a spokesman for
NaTec said the rate would be constructed so that Advance Ross
shareholders would receive a premium of more than 20% over
recent trading levels.
   Advance Ross, primarily an investment concern, holds about
13.7% of NaTec, or about 3.4 million shares, and is the
company's second largest shareholder. NaTec, a unit of CRSS
Inc. of Houston, has about 25 million shares outstanding.
