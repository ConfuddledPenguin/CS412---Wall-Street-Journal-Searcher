   Your Aug. 10 editorial "The Forgotten Ally" was a welcome
recognition of Turkey's unflinching defense of Western
interests. Turkey has been a staunch ally since the formation
of the Turkish republic following World War I. Shutting off
the Iraqi pipeline without even a blink and immediately
beginning the embargo against Iraq is yet another example of
Turkey's devotion to Western ideals.
   That the path taken by Turkey is an extremely costly one
both for the short term and for the long haul is
unquestioned. A casual look at the map reveals that Turkey
has enjoyed a trusting relationship with Iraq. Why would Iraq
build a pipeline that goes north for miles to enter Turkey
before heading west to reach the Mediterranean when a much
shorter route was available directly west through Syria? The
Iraqis trusted their lifeline to the dependable Turks in
preference to their fellow Arabs, the Syrians. Aside from the
immediate loss of $2 billion to $3 billion a year in business
with Iraq and $3 billion in back payments, Turkey faces an
uncertain future with its erstwhile trusting neighbor.

   Following your laudatory editorial, you became the target
(not unexpectedly) of anti-Turkish voices emanating from
individuals with Greek surnames (Letters, Aug. 30). Turkey's
alliance with the West is anathema to these folks who are
still fighting World War I against the Ottoman Empire. Every
time somebody says something nice about Turkey, they come out
slinging mud, with misstated facts, exaggerated half-truths
and absolute lies.
   For the record, Turkey did not invade Cyprus. Turkey
fulfilled its lawful obligation, as Greece and Britain could
also have done, to protect the integrity of Cyprus, which had
fallen into the hands of the military junta then ruling
Greece. Ironically, the Turkish action benefited Greece
immensely by giving the junta a bloody nose and opening the
way for democracy to return to its birthplace in Athens.
   For the record, torture is not condoned in Turkey. It is
against the law. What we call police brutality, illegally
practiced by certain overzealous officers in the U.S.,
becomes government-sanctioned torture in Turkey as related by
those who are still fighting World War I.
   For the record, there were no pogroms in Turkey to
diminish the minority populations. Any non-Turkish citizen of
Turkey who left Turkey left for the same reason we Turks left
-- to seek better economic opportunities abroad.

   Your editorial stated, "The Senate passes resolutions
wallowing in the Armenian tragedies of the old Ottoman
Empire. . . ." I resent the use of the term, "wallowing" and
wonder whether my Jewish friends have been wallowing also in
the tragedies of the Holocaust.
   Any infection, left untreated, continues to be destructive
to the body. Any conflict, left unresolved, continues to
erupt in strife. Any tragedy, left unrecognized, continues to
haunt future generations. Oedipus or the Old Testament
stories of David and Absalom (to name a few literary sources)
are but a reminder of such truths.
