   Middle East war fears continued to hold a floor under most
petroleum prices yesterday, although an apparent leveling in
U.S. demand for gasoline is beginning to have an impact on
world oil markets.
   Prices generally were off sharply as markets opened in the
wake of an industry report of a surprising surge in U.S.
gasoline inventories. Some oil economists and industry
analysts interpreted the report, which was released late
Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, as an early
signal of a possible new sluggishness in U.S. demand for
gasoline. As a result, gasoline prices plunged, helping to
drag down prices of crudes and other fuels around the world.

   Most crudes and fuels rebounded in later trading to finish
strong. But gasoline remained weak.
   In the U.S. futures market, unleaded gasoline for October
delivery settled at 89.9 cents a gallon, down 1.71 cents,
after being down more than two cents for much of the day. The
November contract closed at 87.09 cents a gallon, down less
than one cent.
   Heating oil contracts generally were up about two cents a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, however. October
heating oil rose 2.1 cents a gallon to settle at 88.53 cents.
   The futures price for October crude oil fell 23 cents a
barrel to settle at $33.18. But today is the last day of
trading for the October crude. Crudes traded on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London staged a sharp
recovery in the final minutes to close above day-earlier
levels.
   U.S. gasoline inventories had been expected to decline
rather than rise last week. According to the American
Petroleum Institute's latest report, however, inventories
increased nearly 5.9 million barrels to 216.8 million
barrels.
   That isn't far above the 200 million barrels that the
industry considers to be the minimum working level for
inventories. Also, industry officials caution that one week's
changes in the API figures are hardly enough to suggest a
trend. Still, it's generally assumed that the unexpected
buildup in inventories suggests motorists and others worried
about possible shortages from the Middle East crisis have
completed a rush to "top off" their tanks.
   Demand for gasoline, the chief petroleum product sold in
the U.S., usually begins to decline seasonally at this time
of the year. Labor Day is said to mark the end of the
so-called driving season.
   In addition to the seasonal slackening, some other
factors, including a possible national recession and the
higher pump prices, could contribute to a slowing in gasoline
sales in the U.S., said McDonald J. Beavers, a gasoline
marketing consultant and analyst.
   "There's no doubt higher prices and slower economic
activity are beginning to have an impact on demand," added
Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist at Ashland Oil Inc.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of cattle futures settled
mixed. They are expected to drop at the open of trading today
in the wake of a monthly government survey of feedlots in
seven major ranch states. Feedlots fatten cattle for
slaughter. More young cattle than expected by traders were
placed onto feedlots in August, signaling that the supply of
mature cattle is probably building. That would tend to
depress prices. After the close of trading yesterday at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Agriculture Department
reported that the number of young cattle placed onto feedlots
in August increased 6% from a year earlier. Most traders had
expected only a 3% increase, said Thomas Morgan, an analyst
at Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. The
number of cattle on feedlots on Sept. 1 increased 5% from a
year ago.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices again fell sharply. The
soonest-to-expire September contract was down three cents a
pound at $1.27. The most actively traded December delivery
was off 4.25 cents a pound to $1.1975. The major depressing
factor was a continuation of the selling in London that began
Tuesday and continued yesterday, an analyst said. Traders in
London had recently bought contracts in anticipation that
supplies would tighten when the September contract there
expired yesterday, but they liquidated their holdings when
that condition didn't develop, the analyst said. Trading
during the last 10 minutes of the session in New York was
mostly technical, he said, particularly when the December
contract fell below the $1.20 level for the first time since
mid-August. Another price-depressing development, but less
so, were reports that the Peruvian Labor Ministry may order
workers at the Minero Peru mine to return to work, the
analyst said. The miners walked out Aug. 17. The ministry
declared the work stoppage illegal last week, the analyst
noted, but hasn't ordered workers to return. If the miners
disobey the order, the company can fire them and recruit new
workers, the analyst said. Clashes between strikers and
police already have taken place, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were strong on concern over
supplies. The soonest-to-expire October contract ended up its
daily limit of two cents a pound at 75.90 cents. The
most-active December contract settled with a gain of 1.65
cents at 73.95 cents. Concern that there may not be
sufficient cotton to deliver against the October contract
drove prices for that month higher, according to Sandra Kaul,
analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers. Monday is when the
first notices to deliver cotton against the October contract
will be issued. Ms. Kaul noted that there are only 1,600
bales of cotton in warehouses of the Cotton Exchange in New
York for delivery against the October contract, and 2,500
bales are awaiting certification. However, she said, the open
interest, or the number of outstanding October contracts that
remain to be nullified by an opposite trade or satisfied by
delivery, announced yesterday was 2,168, or the equivalent of
216,800 bales. "The 1989-90 crop, which ended on July 31, was
a modest one and that combined with record export and
domestic demand have reduced U.S. stocks to the lowest level
relative to demand in over a decade," Ms. Kaul said. The
cotton that is normally harvested early, and which was
expected to provide supplies in time for delivery against the
October contract, has been delayed by rains over the past two
weeks, she said. Rainfall at this stage of the crop's
development can also cause damage, she noted. Although the
1990-91 crop is expected to be much larger than last
season's, continued strong demand is likely to reduce
available supplies even further, she said.
