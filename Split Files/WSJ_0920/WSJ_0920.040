   WASHINGTON -- The 1990 oil shock is pushing the U.S.
economy closer to recession while limiting the Federal
Reserve's ability to resist a recession by cutting interest
rates, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said.
   Mr. Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress that "inflationary pressures have increased
concurrently with the weakening of the economy," frustrating
the Fed's goal of averting a recession while gradually
bringing down the inflation rate.

   The always cautious Fed chairman went to unusual lengths
to avoid foreshadowing Fed policy moves in his testimony. He
gave no hint that a long-anticipated Fed move to lower
interest rates is in fact imminent, though he didn't rule it
out.
   At one point, he exasperated some committee members by
stating: "Whether an efficacious policy response to current
developments would seek higher, lower or unchanged interest
rates will depend on the specifics of the situation, which
are shifting day by day."
   For that statement, Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D., Md.) offered
"the obfuscation award of the month."
   The weakness of the U.S. economy -- which was growing more
slowly than the Fed anticipated even before the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait touched off a surge in oil prices --
argues for lower interest rates. But Mr. Greenspan said that
"as of last week" the U.S. economy was "sluggish" but wasn't
showing signs of "a cumulative unwinding of economic
activity."
   He conceded that economists who forecast a recession
aren't being unreasonable. But he warned that nothing the Fed
can do will "prevent the transfer of wealth, and {the} cut in
our standard of living, that stems from higher prices for
imported oil."
   If oil prices average $30 a barrel over the next year, he
said, economic models suggest that the economy's growth rate
will be cut by about one percentage point and that consumer
prices will be 1.5 to two percentage points higher than they
otherwise would have been.
   Mr. Greenspan explicitly identified two events that might
lead the Fed to ease credit: an intensification of the credit
crunch that he cited when the Fed last made a move to reduce
interest rates in July and a "credible, long-term,
enforceable" agreement to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   One constraint on the Fed's ability to rescue the economy
is the recent rise in long-term interest rates in the bond
market -- a reflection of fears of inflation, among other
things, Mr. Greenspan said. He said that any Fed move to push
down the short-term interest rates that it controls directly
would be "counterproductive" unless the markets responded by
bidding down long-term rates.
   Long-term rates are important because they influence
business investment decisions as well as consumers' ability
to buy homes, he said.
