   Michael Rosenberg, president of SFE Technologies, resigned
from the board and said he is approaching several investor
groups with a plan to buy the company's San Fernando Electric
division.
   Mr. Rosenberg, 59 years old, said he resigned from the
board to avoid a conflict of interest. However, he said he
will continue as president and chief operating officer. A
spokesman said the company doesn't plan to name a successor
to the board.
