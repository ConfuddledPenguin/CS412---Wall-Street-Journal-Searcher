   SAN FRANCISCO -- The price of auto insurance in
California, which was supposed to decline in the wake of the
revisionist Proposition 103, is about to go up in a big way
for as many as 1.2 million of the state's drivers.
   Yesterday, the state insurance department backed an 85%
increase in premiums charged for the high-risk drivers who
are insured through the so-called California assigned risk
plan. Unless it ends up being blocked in court, the order
allows insurance companies that make up the plan to impose
the higher rates beginning Sept. 28. According to one
estimate, the increase would raise about $800 million in
revenue for the industry, boosting the average annual premium
to nearly $1,300 from $695.

   About 1.2 million of the estimated 14 million insured
drivers in California are covered by the plan, which the
Legislature created in the 1940s as an insurer of last resort
for people who otherwise can't afford or obtain insurance.
   State insurance officials defended the big increase, and
said it is aimed at rooting out massive fraud and other
problems with the program. Though the exact numbers are in
dispute, the program is considered to include thousands of
good drivers who don't qualify for the special rates but who
have signed up in increasing numbers in recent years as rates
in the so-called voluntary market have soared.
   "These policies are being purchased by people who belong
in the voluntary market and who are being subsidized for no
good reason," Karl Rubinstein, an attorney for the state
insurance department, said. "Our sympathy is with the people
in the voluntary market who are suffering an extra load they
should not have to suffer."
   Nonetheless, consumer groups said the increase would weigh
the heaviest on poor people and vowed to try to stop it in
court. Robert Gnaizda, a San Francisco public-interest
lawyer, said the department's action represents "the largest
unscrutinized rate increase in California history."
   Industry officials said the increase isn't enough. "This
is a welcome relief, but it is only a step in the right
direction," said Steve Feely, chairman of the assigned risk
plan's governing committee. The plan, which hasn't had an
increase in premiums since 1987, is continuing to seek a 160%
increase to offset a deficit that hit $630 million last year.
   The planned increase points up the tangled nature of the
state's recent insurance revision efforts. Proposition 103,
enacted by voters in November 1988, called for major
rollbacks and other strict new regulation to minimize rate
increases, though the initiative has been held inapplicable
to the assigned-risk program.
