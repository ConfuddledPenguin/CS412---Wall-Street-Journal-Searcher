   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- A top Chrysler Corp. official said
the proposed contract between the United Auto Workers union
and General Motors Corp. looks "expensive," but it isn't
clear how long the No. 3 auto maker will fight a pact modeled
on the GM settlement.
   "We've made our position clear from the beginning. GM may
have deep pockets, but we don't," said Bennet E. Bidwell,
chairman of Chrysler's automotive operations. "We can't
afford to match an outrageous pattern settlement."

   But privately, the company is telling Wall Street analysts
that it could afford a pact on terms similar to GM's. When
asked about the contradiction, Chrysler hastily distanced
itself from statements made to analysts, saying they came
from a source that "cannot and does not speak for the
company."
   UAW bargainers won $4 billion of income guarantees and
increases in pension plans from GM during contract
negotiations completed Monday. Accepting the terms of the GM
package could cost Chrysler as much a $1 billion over three
years, analysts said.
   Chrysler is struggling to reverse a steep slide in its
share of the U.S. car market, and trying to cut $2.5 billion
from annual operating costs by June 30. But the company has
the resources to finance such a deal to avoid a strike,
analysts said.
   Moreover, Chrysler has some advantages over GM in terms of
the pact. It is closer to being at full capacity and
therefore would be less likely to have to pay full wages to
workers laid off for extended periods. "We don't have any
more plants to close," as GM does, Mr. Bidwell said.
   In any case, Chrysler will probably have to wait before
confronting the UAW. GM workers must approve the pact, and
then the UAW will bargain with Ford Motor Co.
   Ford officials have said they could accept the GM pact but
will seek some alterations. One problem for Ford is that the
GM contract increases to as much as $5 an hour from $1.25 the
penalty the company must pay for overtime. The payment goes
to a joint training fund and is in addition to overtime
premiums paid directly to workers. Ford runs many plants on
overtime, and company officials say that strategy gives its
UAW workers job security. When sales slowed earlier this
year, Ford cut back on overtime rather than laying people
off.
   Separately, Chrysler officials said they expect to
increase the company's share of U.S. car sales to 10.5% in
the fourth quarter from 8.7% so far this year. Chrysler's
strategy: cut prices on some slow selling models and sell
more aggressively to rental car companies. Chrysler also
wants to raise its share of the truck market.
