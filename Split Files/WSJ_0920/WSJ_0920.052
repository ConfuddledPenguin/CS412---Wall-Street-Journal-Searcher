   BAY OF CAMPECHE, Mexico -- A belching oil rig 50 miles out
to sea may hold the key for the future of Mexico's state oil
monopoly.
   Mexico is pouring $800 million into a complex engineering
project to reduce "backpressure" that is slowing the flow of
oil out of its most productive offshore wells. In the short
term, the success or failure of the Cantarell Project, named
for the bay's largest field, could determine whether Mexico
can remain a major exporter to countries such as the U.S.

   At the rig, hard-hatted rig boss Ricardo Murillo says, "We
know every inch of that platform," as he points to a
roughneck tussling with a manhole-sized pipe fitting. "We
aren't talking about making something new, but making what we
have better."
   Adds Hector Leyva Torres, a Petroleos Mexicanos general
superintendent here in the southern Gulf of Mexico: "It isn't
only the most important project in the company, but the most
important project in Mexico."
   If Cantarell doesn't work, analysts say the oil monopoly,
usually known as Pemex, may face pressure to ease the
country's nationalistic restrictions on foreign investment in
the oil industry.
   Caught in a squeeze between slowing capital investment and
galloping domestic demand, Pemex has been hard-pressed to
maintain its daily 1.2-million-barrel export level -- let
alone help to make up the 4.5 million barrels a day taken off
the international market when Iraq seized Kuwait. Mexico has
pledged to temporarily increase exports by 100,000 barrels a
day, but part of the extra exports will come from existing
inventories.
   How much Pemex can afford to export over the next few
years could well depend on Cantarell. Work began in April on
the project, which Pemex managers view as a showcase for
their efforts to make the infamously inefficient company more
businesslike.
   Pemex managers point to unprecedented public disclosure in
Cantarell subcontracting, thanks to the ouster last year of
the notorious oil workers' union boss, La Quina. Cantarell is
also the first big capital project to be funded from three
recent Pemex issues on foreign bond markets, its first since
the debt crisis began in 1982.
   But for all of the advancement in tactics, some analysts
think Cantarell is a step backward. "Cantarell really speaks
to the collapse of exploration and production of new
resources. It looks to the past more than to the future,"
says George Baker, a Berkeley, Calif., oil consultant. "It is
also fundamentally defensive-trying to maintain the current
export platform, rather than increase it."
   Mr. Baker sees irony in Mexico making a major push to
scrape oil out of the bottom of the well when the country is
widely believed to possess vast untouched oil reserves.
"Mexico's potential probably exceeds that of Saudi Arabia,"
says Bernardo Grossling, a petroleum geologist at the U.S.
Geological Survey.
   But Pemex managers must deal in realities. Mexico's
fast-growing population is pushing demand for oil products;
gasoline consumption grows by 12% a year. Yet, because of
economic woes, investment in Pemex has declined by 75% since
1982, though it is up this year. And oil's nationalistic
symbolism makes it politically risky for the government to
allow foreign oil companies into Mexico.
   Given those constraints, Pemex officials say squeezing
more production out of existing offshore wells is cheaper and
less risky than trying to start new production."Building just
one new production complex would cost $700 million, not to
mention millions of dollars for wells, which may or may not
come in," says Mr. Leyva.
   Pemex concluded that the least expensive remedy was to
squeeze more production out of Cantarell. Without it, an
internal Pemex study estimated, the company's total average
daily production of 2.5 million barrels would fall nearly
400,000 barrels by 1994.
   Not everyone is confident Pemex will succeed. Pemex failed
to get financing for Cantarell from the Japanese
Export-Import Bank. "There are legitimate questions about
Pemex's ability to carry out an engineering project of
Cantarell's complexity," says Japan's ambassador to Mexico,
Ryukichi Imai.
   That kind of talk sits poorly with Pemex officials, who
claim they have turned the company around since La Quina was
ousted from his union post and thrown in jail last year. Last
July, the union signed a contract eliminating many costly
perquisites, such as the union's right to assign 40% of
Pemex's outside contracts. Francisco Rojas, director general
of Pemex, says the savings will total about $1 billion over
the first 17 months.
   Out on the rigs, Pemex managers say the new relationship
with the union sometimes makes it seem like they're working
at an entirely different company. Formerly, subcontractors
tied to the union catered food, painted the rigs and leased
the boats to ferry in roughnecks, among other jobs. "It was
always very expensive and often poor-quality work," says Mr.
Leyva. "Now we open the contracts to bidding, and the savings
are substantial, both in money and efficiency."
   Pemex insists it won't modify longstanding strictures on
foreign equity participation. "Oil is and will continue to be
a resource of the state," Mr. Rojas has said repeatedly.
   How staunchly the government sticks to that pledge may
depend on the Cantarell Project. Analysts see Cantarell as a
stopgap that may allow Pemex to maintain its export levels
through the next few years until, it is hoped, the country's
economic reforms bring the prosperity that will allow
increased investment in Pemex.
   But if the petroleum engineers on the rigs can't maintain
Pemex's place in the export market, Pemex's financial
engineers will get the task of figuring out how to attract
private investment from overseas to the oil giant -- without
stirring the wrath of Mexican nationalists.
