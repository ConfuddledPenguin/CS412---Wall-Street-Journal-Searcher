   NEW YORK -- Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan caused prices of short-term Treasury notes to fall
and long-term Treasury bonds to rise.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point
yesterday, a gain of about $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, fell to 9.01% from 9.06% on Tuesday.
The price of two-year notes declined modestly, while the
yield rose to 8.05% from 8.02% on Tuesday.

   Mr. Greenspan, testifying before the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress yesterday morning, said that the
underlying trend in inflation hasn't improved, that the core
rate of inflation in consumer prices may have crept higher,
and that the chance of a significant break soon in the
inflation trend "would seem to have diminished, in view of
the additional pressures from oil prices."
   The entire bond market initially reacted bearishly to Mr.
Greenspan's comments. But the perception that the Fed's
anti-inflation resolve is undiluted helped long-term bonds.
Short-term issues, which have been buoyed by expectations of
an easing by the Fed, were hurt by the news.
   Though Mr. Greenspan reiterated that the Fed would be
inclined to ease policy once a "credible and enforceable"
agreement to cut the federal government's budget deficit was
forged, bond investors apparently don't view this as an
option that will be available anytime soon.
   Donald Ratajczak, director of economics forecasting at
Georgia State University, said he expects troubling news from
the inflation front to continue over the next few months.
Inflation, he said, is the country's "No. 1 issue."
   The noted inflation forecaster said the September consumer
price index will probably rise an additional 0.6% to 0.7% and
the October gauge 0.7% to 0.8%, following August's jump of
0.8%, the first month to reflect Middle East developments
fully.
   The main blame in the inflation picture falls on oil.
Crude oil futures have virtually doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. October crude oil futures currently trade
at $33.18, down 23 cents a barrel from Tuesday's settlement.
   And while consumers have already seen and felt a big chunk
of the price increases stemming from the runup in oil prices,
"Clearly, there is a lagged effect coming in the consumer
price index," Mr. Ratajczak said. He said petroleum
derivative products, such as chemicals and plastics, have yet
to reflect fully the recent oil-price spike.
   "There is no question, the core inflation rate is creeping
up," he said. The core rate will probably run at a "5 1/2%
clip by year end," he said, but will gradually start to cool,
"because the economy is weak. Assuming oil doesn't go through
the roof, it could start cooling off around Christmas or soon
thereafter."
   Asked whether other price-sector increases are more
restrained than others, Mr. Ratajczak said, "When you look at
CPI, it's awful hard to see any areas that are seeing
moderation."
   He noted that an imbalance in beef and pork production
should raise food prices 5% to 6%. He also pointed out the
biggest increase in clothing prices in about five years, and
boosts in prices of the new model-year autos.
   But he said he sees price inflation beginning to moderate,
once oil prices start a downward trend. The big glitch is the
Persian Gulf crisis and what happens next. "If there's a
shooting war, all bets are off," he said, adding that it is
"very hard to speculate" on what this would mean for oil
prices because of unknown factors, such as the kind and
length of any oil production disruptions.
   Meanwhile, the federal funds rate, the interest rate on
overnight loans between banks, rose as high as 10% yesterday,
after falling to low levels on Tuesday. Traders said a big
New York City bank was bidding for funds to avoid going to
the discount window, which helped to push up the rate.
Yesterday was the final day of a two-week reserve maintenance
period, when banks often bid aggressively for funds to meet
reserve requirements.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities ended mixed. The benchmark 30-year
bond was quoted late at a price of 97 9/32, to yield 9.01%,
compared with 96 23/32, to yield 9.06% on Tuesday. The latest
two-year notes ended at a price of 100 3/32, down from 100
5/32. The yield rose to 8.05% from 8.02%.
   Rates on short-term Treasury bills were unchanged to
higher. The discount rate on three-month bills ended at
7.38%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.6%, the same as
Tuesday. The rate on six-month bills rose slightly to 7.31%
to yield 7.67%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate and Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. ended unchanged, after
spiking up initially on reports that the giant retailer has
drafted plans to buy back sizable amounts of its distressed
junk bonds.
   Macy's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1998,
which traded as high as 56, ended at about 54. The company's
14.5% subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001, ended
unchanged at 40, after climbing two points in early trading.
   High-yield dealers said that investors initially bid up
the bonds on the report of the proposed buy-back, but that
skepticism then took over.
   "When the market didn't see any followthrough and any
evidence that the company was buying the bonds, they weakened
again," a trader said. He also cited questions about whether
Macy can "line up financing" to buy back its bonds. As
previously reported, a top official at Macy said the retail
chain would consider selling a 20% stake in the company for
$300 million, which it would use to buy back some of its
debt.
   In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, were unchanged to lower.
   In the investment-grade market, two Yankee issuers tapped
the debt market. Yankee issues are dollar-denominated bonds
sold by foreign entities. The province of Manitoba sold $350
million of 10-year debentures, priced to yield 9.542%,
through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The province simultaneously sold C$300 million of 10-year
debt in the Canadian market, which was priced to yield
11.25%.
   The kingdom of Malaysia made its debut in the U.S. credit
markets, offering $200 million of 10-year bonds, which were
priced to yield 10.036%, through underwriters led by Salomon
Brothers Inc.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Finance Ministry bought 90 billion yen ($652.7
million) of 10-year government bonds yesterday, a move
designed to support the bond market ahead of next week's
10-year government bond auction.
   Since February, the ministry has bought bonds several
times, often around the time of an auction. In doing so, the
ministry is attempting to support bond prices artificially,
which would enable the government to offer a coupon rate on
the bonds as low as possible, dealers said.
   The government bond buy-back gave mild support to the bond
market in the morning, but dealers said the influence was
small.
   In trading, the current benchmark 10-year government bonds
ended at a price of 81.20, down 0.02 point, to yield 8.56%.
(When calculated using the semiannual compound method, the
yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.79%, according to Salomon
Brothers Inc.)
   In London, prices of British government bonds ended mixed
after comments from Otto Poehl, the head of West Germany's
Bundesbank, the central bank, knocked prices of long gilts
lower.
   Mr. Poehl said Britain's economic difficulties might delay
sterling's entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The comments caused prices of the benchmark long-term bond to
decline 1/2 point.
   West German bonds ended unchanged, and French treasurys
ended modestly firmer in listless trading.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Investors couldn't wait to get their hands on an issue of
$100 million Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
consolidated notes sold in yesterday's session.
   The notes, won by a BT Securities Corp. group, sold out
within 10 minutes of the sale, an underwriting official said.
   Meanwhile, municipal bonds ended the session unchanged in
stagnant dealings.
   The notes, which are rated MIG-1/SP1-plus, and mature
March 15, 1993, are priced for reoffering as 6 1/4% issues at
par.
   "The deal was done and closed immediately after the sale;
$80 million was sold pre-sale and the balance went within 10
minutes," Steve Milano, vice president, municipal
underwriting, at BT Securities, said. "All of the bonds went
to permanent investors."
   The dual tax exemption for many New York and New Jersey
residents, as well as the issuer's high ratings, accounted
for the large amounts of retail and institutional interest in
the deal, the underwriting official said. "It's one of the
highest-quality bonds you can find in New York" with a short
maturity, Mr. Milano said.
   In related market activity, Union Bank of Switzerland
denied it is having talks with Philadelphia. The bank's
statement was a response to a Dow Jones News Service report
that Philadelphia is discussing with the bank the possibility
of borrowing $500 million. The story quoted a person close to
the negotiations as saying that Union Bank would lend the
city $500 million and then resell the debt in the form of
bonds to private investors. The term of the loan would range
from one to 10 years and probably be structured as a general
obligation bond.
   Philadelphia general obligation bonds have shown little
reaction to the latest flurry of financial news. Traders said
the bonds traded to yield about 9.5%, equal to levels late
Tuesday.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue, due 2018, was unchanged at 97 1/8 to
97 3/8, to yield 7.42%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices were little changed in
late dealings.
   Morning trading was dominated first by the August
housing-starts data and then by reaction to Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the congressional
Joint Economic Committee. The market was underpinned by news
that housing starts dropped 1.7% last month, for the seventh
consecutive monthly downturn. Mr. Greenspan's statements
tugged the markets downward, but losses were regained after
the Fed's "Beige Book" report on business conditions in the
12 Fed districts was released. The report found that economic
activity in most of the districts "is expanding more slowly
or declining."
   Only one new mortgage-backed issue was announced in
yesterday's session, a $500 million issue of Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, remic mortgage
securities that is being offered in eight classes by Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. A remic, or real estate mortgage investment
conduit, is a type of security underwritten by Wall Street
firms that provides a method of dividing up the income flows
from many mortgages into new securities with various interest
rates and maturities to attract banks, insurers and other big
investors to the home-mortgage market.
   The offering, Series FHLMC Gold 1008, is collateralized
with Freddie Mac 9% Gold PCs, or participation certificates.
   Mortgage securities lagged behind U.S. Treasurys, as
10-year notes were up about 1/4 point on the day. Yield
spreads consequently widened slightly, as Treasury yields
fall relative to mortgage securities yields.
   In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association, or Ginnie Mae, 9 1/2% issues for October
delivery were unchanged at 98 13/32, Freddie Mac Gold 9 1/2%
issues were off 1/32 at 98 7/8, and Federal National Mortgage
Association, or Fannie Mae, 9 1/2% issues were down 1/32 at
98 22/32.
