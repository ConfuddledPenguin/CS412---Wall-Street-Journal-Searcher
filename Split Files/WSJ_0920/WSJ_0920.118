   Tyco Toys Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to
acquire Nasta International Inc. for a sweetened price of
$1.25 per share, up from $1 a share, and extended the offer
until Oct. 3.
   Tyco Toys of Mount Laurel, N.J., said the companies also
reached an agreement, subject to certain conditions, to
settle three lawsuits brought in response to Tyco's original
tender offer. The settlement reflects the new offer price and
includes an agreement to pay certain attorney fees and
expenses.

   As of Sept. 17, 607,965 shares were tendered under the
original offer, which would increase Tyco's stake in New
York-based Nasta to 86%, from its current 74% stake. The
offer is not conditioned on any minimum number of shares
being tendered and the new price applies to shares already
tendered at the previous price.
