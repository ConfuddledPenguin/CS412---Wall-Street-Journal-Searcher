   RENO, Nev. -- The Mustang Ranch, perhaps the nation's
best-known legal brothel, may be on its last legs.
   On Tuesday, the brothel, which has been trying since 1983
to reorganize itself under federal bankruptcy laws, was
ordered liquidated by a federal bankruptcy judge here. The
judge acted upon a petition by Mustang Ranch's largest
creditor, the Internal Revenue Service, which claims to be
owed up to $13 million in back taxes from the 105-room
brothel, located a few miles east of here. The tax dispute
has been simmering for years.

   The order came after the brothel's latest attempt to sell
itself and raise capital collapsed. At least twice in recent
years, the owners of Mustang Ranch have attempted,
unsuccessfully, to raise money in public offerings. The
latest IRS move followed an unsuccessful attempt to sell the
brothel outright to a closely held company, although the
brothel's owners claim it was the IRS's own objections that
caused that deal to fall apart.
   The liquidation order has disrupted normal operations at
Mustang Ranch, according to Peter Perry, a Reno attorney for
the brothel. The court appointed a bankruptcy trustee to
oversee operations, but the trustee is having a hard time of
it. "Nobody wants to work for the trustee, so they all left,"
Mr. Perry says. "She went out there, and tried to take over.
But who wants to work for her? People have got to really
worry about her expertise" in running a brothel.
   Mr. Perry said the brothel plans to fight the liquidation
order; the trustee and the IRS couldn't immediately be
reached.
