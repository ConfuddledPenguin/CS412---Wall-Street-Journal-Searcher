   Before accepting a two-year assignment (1986-88) as
administrator of a World Bank economic rehabilitation project
in Equatorial Guinea, Harvard economist Robert Klitgaard was
warned by an American aid official that "on a scale of one to
10, even an African scale, it's zero." Mr. Klitgaard wasn't
able to change that rating, but on his return he did produce
"Tropical Gangsters: One Man's Experience With Development
and Decadence in Deepest Africa" (Basic, 281 pages, $22.95),
which is at once an engaging travelogue into that vaporously
hot Central African backwater, and a valuable source for
explaining why Third World countries ostensibly committed to
the creation of a market economy frequently fail to make any
progress toward that end.
   During its Spanish colonial days, Equatorial Guinea was
more prosperous than any of its neighbors, boasting a
respectable literacy rate of 60%, a reasonably efficient
public health system, and a relatively thriving economy based
on the export of hardwood timber, coffee, fish, assorted
foodstuffs and the world's richest cocoa.

   By the 1970s, all this was memory thanks to the homicidal
reign of Francisco Macias Nguema, who reduced the population
by at least a third, ruined the cash economy and destroyed
the infrastructure to the point where there were only two
doctors left in the land, one of them the president's
overworked personal psychiatrist. Macias's last act of state
was to burn the country's entire stock of hard currency, some
$105 million, which he had buried in sacks around his
compound.
   By those standards, the economic program promulgated in
1985 by Macias's thuggish nephew and successor, Obiang Nguema
Mbasogo, seemed promising at first. The government removed
price controls, adopted the convertible CFA franc, sold off
most state enterprises, and rid itself of the Cuban
internationalists who formed the nucleus of Macias's palace
guard. Yet it is evident from Mr. Klitgaard's account that
the country is light-years from recovering the level of
prosperity and civility that obtained during the colonial
era.
   Two coup attempts occurred during Mr. Klitgaard's stay,
the suppression of which involved the torture of innocent
men, including one of Mr. Klitgaard's most talented
assistants in the restructuring project. The infrastructure
is only partially restored, despite the infusion of
substantial amounts of foreign aid, which now comprises
almost half of the GNP. Exports remain at a fraction of
pre-independence levels, and the country now imports even
fish (Macias burned the trawlers to prevent people from
escaping).
   Mr. Klitgaard provides a more than adequate explanation
for the country's failure. This tiny nation has 17 cabinet
ministries, each with a full complement of ill-paid
bureaucrats, most of whom sincerely believe that property is
theft. Requisitioning of services and capital stocks on the
flimsiest of pretexts is common. So is corruption, and, not
surprisingly, doing any kind of business in Equatorial Guinea
remains a losing proposition, even if access to water and
electricity was constant, which it is not, never mind the
foreign assistance programs described by Mr. Klitgaard. This
is partly due to the government's indifference to maintenance
requirements, and partly due to the fact that no means exist
for monitoring consumption. Government officials typically
receive water and electricity without payment, stiffing
private users with outrageous charges for outrageously
unreliable service.
   The same lack of accountability has been even more
disastrous for the two state-owned banks, which exist
primarily to funnel IMF and World Bank funds to the president
and his camarilla in the form of unsecured loans. The World
Bank's cocoa rehabilitation project, for example, merely
prompted Obiang and his gang to grab the largest cocoa
plantations for themselves in order to secure access to loan
money, which was squandered on luxury cars and videocassette
recorders.
   Mr. Klitgaard and his World Bank team, with the aid of the
Equatoguinean finance minister and a few other allies in the
government, did succeed in persuading the president to adopt
an economic restructuring program predicated on a market
economy and establishing a rotating fund to finance
small-scale private enterprises. But while this plan looks
good on paper, Mr. Klitgaard gives us ample reason to doubt
that it will be adhered to in good faith.
   The fundamental reason why the notions of private
property, civil autonomy, limited government and political
pluralism have fared so poorly in post-colonial Africa is
that the continent lacks that very sense of social cohesion
and shared values that the partisans of African socialism
claim as the first attribute of the African character. As one
of his more perceptive Equatoguinean colleagues complains to
Mr. Klitgaard, "In Africa . . . people do not have a common
interest." Instead, "First comes the family, then the clan,
then the region, and finally the country. But the country
always comes last."
   Mr. Klitgaard's account is not without a few bright spots.
Many of the Equatoguineans he met compare favorably with some
of the ignorant and indolent international aid officials with
whom he had to do business. He also discovered a great deal
of human potential and natural beauty as he traveled along
the country's deeply pitted roads with his surfboard in an
ultimately successful search for 10-foot waves.
