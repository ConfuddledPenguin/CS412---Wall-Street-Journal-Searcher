   In the wake of the October 1987 market crash, many
economists were convinced the next recession was no more than
a year away. Somehow, though, the economy has continued to
expand. Saddam Hussein, however, may be producing the
long-expected recession.
   If the 52 economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, half now
say an official recession will be under way by the end of
this year; a similar percentage probably applies to
economists generally. The economy was slowing even before
Iraq invaded Kuwait, and rising energy costs and bigger
budget deficits may push the economy over the brink.

   It's likely but by no means certain.
   Even those who vote for a 1990 recession have some doubts.
Lawrence Meyer, an econometrician based at Washington
University of St.Louis, expects a recession to begin in the
fourth quarter. But he worries about the political
uncertainties. "Our models," he says, "can't fully handle the
problems. There's more need for judgmental analysis." In
other words, there's more need for a few careful guesses.
   Close to half of all analysts see no recession in 1990,
and they offer some interesting reasons for their relative
optimism.
   Those who think the economy will muddle through obviously
assume the oil shock will be handled, with increased supplies
from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere offsetting most of the lost
output from Iraq and Kuwait. They also don't expect
full-scale war, shutting off a great deal of oil. Oil prices
will settle at about $25 a barrel, about $5 above the
pre-invasion level, and the market will stabilize.
   There is general agreement that the oil price shock will
keep upward pressure under general prices, at least through
the end of this year. Some analysts see this as a sign of
unsuspected economic strength. Robert Brusca, chief economist
of Nikko Securities Co. International, for instance, notes
that the consumer price index is rising at a year-over-year
rate of 4.8%. "If the economy is so weak," he asks, "how can
such price pressures persist?"
   Michael Keran, chief economist of Prudential Insurance
Co., thinks that high oil prices, and a fear of more of the
same, can have a positive effect on the economy in the short
run. "Increased energy costs are a factor of production which
raises the cost of producing a whole host of other goods," he
says. "Businessmen, aware that this creates a potential for
future price increases, will add to their inventory
holdings."
   Some analysts were encouraged by the revision of the
inflation-adjusted gross national product for the second
quarter, although the gain remained at an overall 1.2% rate.
Consumer spending and net exports were revised upward
substantially, says Morris Cohen, a Hackensack, N.J.,
consultant. "Thus the economy turned out to be in better
shape than the original estimates had shown." Mr. Cohen does
expect the fourth quarter to be negative, but he looks for an
upturn at the end of the year. (For the consensus views, see
the accompanying table.)
   The optimistic analysts expect the Federal Reserve
eventually to provide more help in fending off a 1990
recession. Lacy Hunt, chief economist of CM&amp;M Group, says,
"Currently, the Federal Reserve is likely to pursue a
relatively accommodative policy in an attempt to keep the
economy growing, even at the expense of higher inflation."
   Mr. Hunt notes three other props that could keep the
economy out of a recession this year. Before the oil shocks
of 1974 and 1979, business inventories had been very high,
and the subsequent liquidations were heavily responsible for
the recessions that followed. At the moment, business
inventories are relatively low.
   Second, the composition of the economy has changed. The
now-dominant service sector is less affected by higher energy
costs than manufacturing was in the 1970s. Finally, the weak
dollar is helping to push up exports and limit imports.
   Even the relative optimists don't foresee a business boom.
"While the economy should avoid recession," Mr. Hunt says,
"the growth rate should be a very sluggish 0.5% through late
1991."
   Mickey Levy, chief economist of CRT Government Securities
in New York, says the difference between a positive growth
rate of 0.5% and a negative rate of 0.5% is so small the
average businessman would be unlikely to feel it.
   Mr. Levy likes to stress the difference between economic
risks and economic uncertainty. "Risks," he says, "we can
deal with by the way we plan and make investments.
Uncertainties are just uncertainties -- all we can do is
speculate." Seldom have forecasters felt so trapped in
speculation.
