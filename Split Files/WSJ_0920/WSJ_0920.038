   Matthew Scudder, the unlicensed P.I. whose moody exploits
have been chronicled in seven earlier novels by Lawrence
Block, continues to be one of the most interesting private
investigators on the fiction scene.
   An ex-NYPD detective who quit the force after accidentally
causing the death of an innocent bystander, Scudder is a
recovering alcoholic who takes time out from prowling the
mean streets of Manhattan to attend AA meetings. In the
Scudder books, there's always an added element of suspense:
Will Matt start drinking again?

   He's certainly given plenty of prompting in Mr. Block's
taut and chilling "A Ticket to the Boneyard" (Morrow, 302
pages, $18.95). It seems an episode from Scudder's checkered
police past is back to hound him in the form of James Leo
Motley, a psychopath Scudder once bent the law to have
imprisoned. Now Motley is out and intent on grisly revenge.
   In messages sent first to Elaine, a call girl who
initially involved Scudder with Motley, and then to Scudder
himself, Motley lets it be known that he plans to kill Matt
"and all of his women" -- from former lovers to chance
acquaintances, apparently in sadistically violent fashion.
   The first victims are someone whose testimony helped
Scudder put Motley away, plus the woman's husband and
children. Next Motley kills a female whom Scudder barely
knows. The body count increases, but Matt is unable to
persuade police of the link between these seemingly random
crimes. Using the techniques of his trade, Scudder attempts
to find and stop Motley on his own, even as he tries to
protect himself and Elaine.
   Mr. Block's previous Scudder novels have worked
imaginative variations on the hard-boiled detective story.
Despite the legwork here, there's not much detection in
"Boneyard." Scudder's deadly cat-and-mouse game with the
depraved, Nietzsche-quoting Motley makes for a pretty
straightforward thriller. But Mr. Block proves as adept at
this sort of tale as he is with private-eye cases. As usual,
he fleshes out the bare bones of his account with several
effective side plots and a great deal of convincingly gritty
detail.
   One nagging question: Wouldn't someone as acutely aware of
his city's and society's ills as Scudder voice even passing
concern about resuming physical relations with a high-risk
professional?
   Another highly distinctive P.I. is Philip Kerr's Bernhard
Gunther, who appears for the second time in "The Pale
Criminal" (Viking, 274 pages, $16.95). Gunther, too, is a
former cop -- an ex-Kriminalinspektor of KRIPO, Berlin's
criminal police -- who plies his trade in the treacherous
milieu of Nazi Germany in 1938.
   By turns vulgar and starkly lyrical, Bernie is a tarnished
knight whose sexual fantasies run neck and neck with what's
left of his morality. Like many of his cronies, he's repelled
by Hitler and company but feels powerless to do much except
wisecrack in the Berliner fashion, which "sounds cruel if you
don't understand it, and even crueller if you do."
   Gunther quit KRIPO out of disgust at Goering's police
purges, but now the force wants him back temporarily to take
charge of the hunt for a brutal killer who's preying upon
teenaged Aryan females. The job offer is nonrefusable, and
Kommissar Gunther finds himself returned to the ranks of
those he detests, threading a tricky course between rival
political factions as he uncovers the loathsome conspiracy
behind the schoolgirls' murders.
   From S.S.-occupied palaces to pornographers' dens, from
burghers' mansions to lurid bordellos, Gunther travels some
truly awful boulevards, surveying scenes of decadence and
ugliness that might have been sketched by George Grosz. Mr.
Kerr renders this dire place and time in an effective and
aptly stilted prose that often reads as if translated from
the German. There are surprising Teutonic twists to the
grammar, and the characters utter quirky slang and turns of
phrase so authentic-sounding they could either be completely
accurate or totally invented. (A pistol is a "lighter." A
madman is a "spinner." "Are you stretching me out?" means
"Are you putting me on?")
   Part private-eye tale and part police procedural,
"Criminal" pulls the strands of its politically informed
story together in a finale that satisfies both
detective-story convention and historical truth. The larger
achievement of this book and of the earlier Gunther novel
("Pale Violets") is in the convincing presentation of a
society that seems to be arranging "the very end of
everything." While Bernhard Gunther labors to protect this
grotesque status quo, crimes beyond the ken of any working
detective are waiting in the wings.
