   While other companies spend millions to establish
corporate identities, Xerox Corp. yesterday launched an
effort to shed one.
   Famous for inventing the copier and personal computer,
then ceding the markets, Xerox is poised for a critical
comeback bid. Success promises big returns from a
computerized approach to paperwork that may change business
as much as did its original copier. Says Chairman David
Kearns: "This is a really, really big deal for us."

   But another failure -- and there have been several over
the past 20 years -- could see Xerox outflanked again with
its own inventions. And that would cripple the company's
hopes of ever participating in an information age it
predicted 15 years ago, says Charles Pesko, chief executive
of BIS Marketing Information, a market-research firm.
   "They have to succeed," says Mr. Pesko. "At this stage,
they have no other choice." Echoes David Nadler, a consultant
who has advised Xerox: "There's only so long you can defend a
maturing technology like the copier."
   In Act I of a two-part rollout, Xerox yesterday unveiled a
wide-ranging package of computers and software intended to
help people in offices work better together. While not
unique, the technology plays off Xerox's strengths:
Easy-to-use, consistent displays; good communications; and an
approach that emphasizes work groups. As in almost every
computer announcement these days, Xerox claimed its products
would work with those of other major manufacturers.
   But yesterday's introductions were just setting the scene.
Act II comes Oct. 2, when Xerox will augment this vision by
introducing a new kind of technology: a $200,000 machine that
combines high-speed copying, printing, scanning, facsimile
and computing capabilities in a single unit.
   The output is aimed at matching the quality usually
associated with offset printing.
   This new machine, known inside the company as Xenith, is
more than 15 years in the making. Though no one will put a
price tag on its development, insiders say it is the
company's largest-ever project -- in a company that spends
$800 million a year on R&amp;D. For the first time since 1959,
when the Xerox 914 copier rolled out, the firm is pushing an
entirely new approach to paper work.
   Xenith will hook up with the rest of Xerox's computing
products and with other computers to provide what the firm
will tout as a seamless solution for companies swamped with
paper work. Acting as an exchange point between the world of
paper and the world of computers, the big multifunction
device is Xerox's first digital copier and is designed to
become part of a family of machines that would be the
company's bread-and-butter revenue producer through the
1990s, according to industry executives.
   Essentially, Xenith will be able to take in everything an
office now receives -- paper documents, computer information,
pictures, graphics, even mail -- and then massage it, change
it and redistribute it.
   It will put a publishing-grade printing device in the
hands of casual computer users. Using Xenith, a telephone
representative at an insurance company will be able to send a
bound copy of a particular policy with the push of a button;
a desk jockey at a government agency could send out 100 bid
requests on demand, complete with instruction manuals,
without visiting a stockroom piled with forms.
   But the machine works both ways: Since it also converts
paperbound images to electronic data, it will allow computer
users to manipulate and combine documents on-screen. With a
"jukebox" of optical disks, it could even serve as the
backbone of a filing system that everyone in the company
could access.
   Taken together, Xerox's two announcements embody a very
particular view of how computing will develop over the next
few decades: Increasingly dependent on decentralized networks
of computers, the argument goes, firms will be forced to look
to better software and intelligent, highly efficient
peripheral devices for productivity gains. Documents will
have to exist primarily in computers, while paper becomes
just another means of display.
   The announcements also aim to alter Xerox's popular image
as the leading has-been in office equipment. Despite costly
efforts to become a player in computers and finance, Xerox
has repeatedly failed to shed its identity as the firm that
pioneered the stand-alone copier, then saw its 100% market
share devoured almost entirely by more cost-efficient
Japanese producers.
   Xerox's image in high-tech circles is equally
unflattering. It came up with many of the computer industry's
most important innovations, only to let other firms copy its
ideas while it invested in outdated technology and dubious
sidelines.
   "This is a company that has been painfully slow to
recognize and commercialize its own best technology," says
Alex Henderson, an analyst who follows Xerox for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Xenith is likely Xerox's last chance to take advantage of
a flowering of genius that took place at its Palo Alto
Research Center (PARC) in Palo Alto, Calif., during the
1970s. That produced breakthroughs like the personal
computer, the laser printer and the "mouse," which have so
far benefited almost every electronics firm except Xerox.
   Xenith is perhaps the only part of that legacy that hasn't
been plundered so far. Originally code-named Harvest, the
project started as a labor of love for a tiny team of Xerox
engineers, marketers and futurists who had been directed to
come up with technologies that would supplant traditional
copiers before competitors beat them to the punch.
   "It was like a brave new world," recalls John Shoemaker,
who oversaw the team for several years and now works at Sun
Microsystems Inc. "We were looking at everything, with no
preconceptions. It was hard to ask anyone their opinion of
our work, because nothing like it had ever existed before."
   Mr. Shoemaker remembers nights and weekends in the late
1970s when engineers' spouses would come in to sort machine
parts so that prototypes could be assembled on time. From
this primal tinkering evolved a massive machine that requires
more lines of computer code to control it than many mainframe
computers.
   "This will be very different than anything else that is
out there," says William Lowe, the Xerox executive vice
president imported from International Business Machines Corp.
to push Xenith out the door.
   Mr. Lowe is coy about details of the Xenith machine --
indeed, he carefully avoids acknowledging its existence --
even after yesterday's announcement. But he calls
computerized documents "the big news of the 1990s," in much
the same way personal computers were the big news of the
1980s.
   He knows a bit about that subject: He is sometimes
referred to as the godfather of IBM's original personal
computer.
   In an interview, Chairman Kearns leaves no doubt that
Xenith and its successors are the key to returning his firm
to double-digit revenue growth it last saw in the mid-1980s,
"rather than clunking along at 6% or 7%." He also predicts
that the new products would enable Xerox's $12.4 billion
office-products division to deliver annual returns of 17% to
19% in the mid-1990s.
   Adds Paul Allaire, Xerox's new chief executive, in a
separate interview: "This will show people that all the money
we've been investing in research and development wasn't
wasted."
   But while Xenith is clearly impressive, its success is far
from assured. For one thing, Xerox is still busy extricating
itself from a morass of problems caused by its last attempt
to make a name outside of copiers, an ill-fated foray led by
Mr. Kearns into financial services during the early 1980s.
   That move had some benefits: The financial services
division did well for a few years, giving Xerox breathing
room to implement a quality program that helped its
once-dominant copiers regain market share against Japanese
competition. But the diversion has recently become as heavy a
burden as the ancient millstone Mr. Allaire keeps propped in
his office in Stamford, Conn.
   At the company's annual meeting in May, Mr. Kearns
conceded that a dismal performance by Xerox's $5.4 billion
financial services arm will cause profits to drop in 1990,
even before a $375 million write-off taken in the first
quarter to cover bad real-estate investments. In 1989, the
company earned $704 million, or $6.41 a share, on revenue of
$17.6 billion. Mr. Kearns didn't suggest how much profits
will fall this year.
   Mr. Allaire has stopped internal subsidies to financial
services, and has announced his intention to sell or close
any business that can't return at least 15% on equity.
   Then there's the competition. By setting itself up as a
seller of office systems rather than stand-alone copiers and
printers, Xerox is poaching on some pretty serious turf. Many
large computer companies have articulated plans to tie
computers, output devices and software together, and Xerox's
vision is yet another option in a world that's confused
already.
   "They may have a hard time showing that this is something
different enough to merit attention," says analyst Peter
Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Moreover, companies like IBM and Unisys Corp. got a jump
on Xerox earlier this year by announcing systems designed to
woo exactly the market Xenith is aimed at: Large-scale
pushers of paper like banks, insurance companies and
government contractors.
   Xerox will attempt to play down such conflicts by making
Xenith take advantage of everyone else's computers and
software. But the company was beaten to market last week by
Eastman Kodak Co., whose well-received new LionHeart
high-speed printing system also connects to a wide range of
desktop computers.
   Though LionHeart apparently isn't as versatile as Xenith,
Kodak promises to offer enhancements. Kodak says it sells for
"less than $250,000, fully configured."
   Meanwhile, Japanese companies like Ricoh Corp., Canon Inc.
and Sharp Corp. are hoping to ambush Xerox's multifunction
ambitions by introducing low-end machines that copy, print,
scan and fax. National Semiconductor Corp. recently unveiled
a microchip that will enable such machines, which are
sometimes generically called Hydras, to be made cheaply.
   With cheap Hydras being shared by work groups -- or even
with one on every desk -- the appeal of a powerful machine
like Xenith, which is more reminiscent of a mainframe than a
personal computer, may be limited to a small number of
paper-intensive companies.
   "We believe that the multifunction market will take off
only when the price drops low enough," says Les Wilson,
corporate manager of imaging systems at National
Semiconductor. "I hate to say it, but right now it looks like
the Japanese have the technology to dominate this market."
   Finally, there's the Xenith machine itself. While most who
have seen it are impressed with Xenith's technology, which
can do just about anything short of making toast, they worry
about whether it offers enough advances to justify its high
price.
   Says one prominent Xerox alumnus: "It's a neat machine,
and a worthwhile concept, but for hundreds of thousands of
dollars they'll have a lot of convincing to do."
   "If Xerox says it is trying to create a new market, we
respect that," says Canon's Haruo Murase. "We like their
idea." But, he adds with a laugh, "a $200,000 machine is a
very, very expensive way to test that market."
   Mr. Allaire agrees that the major challenge with Xenith
will be marketing, but argues that the business environment
is moving in his favor. Printing of all sorts -- copying,
laser printing, offset printing -- accounts for $80 billion a
year, he says, and Xerox soon will be positioned to compete
for three-quarters of that market.
   And while Xenith is clearly aimed at the high end of the
market, where Xerox has traditionally been most successful,
company officials indicate that a workgroup-size Xenith is
likely in the next few years; a desktop version is further
away, if Xerox decides to build one at all.
   But success won't initially come from a choice of
machines, analysts say. It will rest on whether people
believe Xerox's view of how paper work should be done in a
computerized environment.
   Mr. Allaire says most top executives aren't aware that
their companies spend 10% or more of their revenue producing
and manipulating documents, and that the area is ripe for a
major advance in productivity. He uses the super-efficient
American Express charge-card billing system, to which Xerox
contributed, as an example.
   "We have to show people that kind of thing," he says. "We
have to ennoble the document somehow."
   To that end, Xerox tapped the well-connected Mr. Lowe to
line up an impressive list of industry heavyweights as
collaborators, from Sun to Netframe Systems Inc., a maker of
powerful "file server" computers, to Adobe Systems Inc.,
which controls the software that allows computers print and
display type.
   Those alliances, coupled with Xerox's commitment to
connect its products with just about every computer in
existence, have convinced at least some people that Xerox can
finally change its image and emerge as a player in the
computer industry.
   "The probability is on Xerox's side this time," says Ajit
Kapur of Meta Group, a market-research firm in Stamford. "A
company can miss only so many opportunities before it gets
things right."
