   NEW YORK -- Stocks fell and bonds rose on comments by
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that investors
deciphered to mean the Fed won't be turning on the money
spigot soon.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.86 points on
expanding volume to 2557.43. Bond investors, reassured that
Mr. Greenspan is a determined inflation fighter, bid prices
higher, and the dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies for the same reason.

   Stock investors have been hoping the Fed would ease
interest rates to keep the economy from slipping into a
recession. But in testimony before the House, Mr. Greenspan
indicated he remains less concerned about the threat of
recession than he is about surging inflation.
   Though the market still is focused on oil prices, said
Jack Conlon, head of equities at Rothschild Inc., Mr.
Greenspan called the tune yesterday. "The market didn't get
what it expected," he said. "It was looking for more
significant easing. Instead, the Fed seems to be locked in
neutral. That's disappointing."
   Some stocks tumbled. Merck, for example, plunged as much
as 4 on an analyst's negative report about a promising new
drug; the stock ended down 3 1/8 at 76 7/8. And American
General sank 6 3/8 to 33 5/8, affecting other takeover
stocks. The company said it was having trouble selling itself
to fend off an unwanted suitor.
   The result: "Two gaping holes" in the limelight stocks
that "certainly doesn't help the cause," Mr. Conlon said.
   Stocks didn't react to a drop in oil prices; the October
crude-oil futures contract fell 23 cents a barrel to $33.18.
As long as oil isn't making new highs, "stocks won't be
following oil," said Sal Gilbertie, oil-futures trader at
Merrill Lynch. "The stock market is getting used to intraday
volatility."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 147.5 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues led
advancers, 883 to 599.
   Bond prices rose one-half point, or $5 for each $1,000 of
face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond fell to 9.01%.
   The dollar rose against most currencies. In late New York
trading, the dollar was up to 1.5715 marks from 1.5530 marks
Tuesday. But it edged down to 137.52 yen from 137.85 yen a
day earlier.
