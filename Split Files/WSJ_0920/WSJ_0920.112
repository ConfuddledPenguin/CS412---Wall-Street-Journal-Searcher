   NEW YORK -- The scene outside Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.'s Gold Street office here on Monday would have made any
Wall Street executive cringe.
   Eloise Burg, a 61-year-old widow from Florida, marched for
three hours to protest about the $200,000 she says she lost
through limited-partnership investments sold by
Prudential-Bache. Refusing the brokerage firm's requests to
move inside and talk, Mrs. Burg hoisted a cardboard placard
attacking Prudential-Bache and declaring: "Investors beware."

   Prudential-Bache, once Wall Street's biggest purveyor of
limited partnerships with $610 million in sales last year,
has joined Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and other brokerage
firms in pulling back sharply from the troubled partnership
industry in recent months. It has laid off 40 of its
55-member partnership staff. But the brokerage unit of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America is finding that it isn't
so easy to put its partnership problems behind it.
   Lawsuits and arbitration claims by angry investors are
mounting, and most aren't expected to be resolved for at
least two to three years.
   Prudential-Bache could face $800 million or more of claims
just related to the highly publicized collapse of VMS Realty
Partners in Chicago, whose partnerships Prudential-Bache
aggressively sold, lawyers familiar with the cases say.
Prudential-Bache won't confirm that figure. The ultimate loss
on VMS "frankly is up in the air," says Loren Schechter,
Prudential-Bache's top lawyer.
   All told, the brokerage firm faces lawsuits over 30 of the
VMS partnerships its brokers sold to wealthy investors.
Herbert Beigel, a Chicago lawyer who represents some
investors suing Prudential-Bache, estimates that overall as
much as $2 billion of investment capital has been lost
through partnerships sold by the brokerage firm in the 1980s.
"I don't know of any brokerage firm that has more partnership
exposure than Prudential-Bache."
   Despite all its troubles, Prudential-Bache still believes
partnership investments can be good products. Shearson --
under new management from its parent American Express Co. --
has announced it won't originate any more new partnership
deals, though it will sell others' deals. But
Prudential-Bache vows to bring out a variety of partnerships
for investors when feasible. This is even as the firm's
lawyers deal with the legal woes from soured deals of the
past.
   "We're still in business to offer any product we feel is
appropriate and will work in this marketplace," says Richard
Sichenzio, Prudential-Bache's brokerage chief. "What we're
offering going forward is those investments that are
appropriate for today's economic conditions."
   And that means no more real-estate limited partnerships
marketed as tax shelters, of the kind that Prudential-Bache
and other Wall Street firms sold heavily to wealthy
individuals, and that were torpedoed by the 1986 tax overhaul
and slumping real-estate prices. "Tax-incentive limited
partnerships are no longer something that is being received
well by clients or the sales force," says Mr. Sichenzio.
   Instead, commodities partnerships are a hot product these
days, and Prudential-Bache says it will continue to sell many
of those, as well as aircraft-leasing partnerships. But
compared with its total sales of $610 million last year,
Prudential-Bache is likely to sell only $175 million to $275
million in partnerships of all kinds this year, officials
say.
   Prudential-Bache, which as a firm posted a net loss of $51
million last year, apparently hasn't felt the need to make a
large reserve in recent months to cover possible
partnership-related legal costs. That's partly because it has
been difficult for investors to prove in court that their
losses were the brokerage firm's fault, or that the firm
improperly marketed the investments, lawyers say. Mr.
Schechter, the Prudential-Bache lawyer, won't discuss details
of the firm's reserves, saying only: "We think our general
reserves for contingencies are entirely adequate."
   George Ball, Prudential-Bache chairman, was out of the
country traveling on business and couldn't be reached for
comment this week.
   Among other issues, Prudential-Bache soon has to decide
what to do with $1.6 billion of Prudential-Bache Energy
Income partnerships it co-sponsored with Graham Resources
Inc., a Covington, La., oil and gas syndicator, between 1983
and 1989. Analysts say about half the 26 partnerships are now
performing below expectations. Prudential-Bache and Graham
have been discussing a "roll-up" of the partnerships, or
consolidating them into a publicly traded corporation, since
last January.
   While it may successfully take care of its legal and
marketing problems, Prudential-Bache still faces a
public-relations dilemma. Partnership investors typically
complain louder than, say, an investor whose stocks have
plummeted. That's because partnerships are more-complicated
investments, and investors typically rely far more heavily on
a broker's advice. Also, partnerships are far more difficult
than stocks for investors to sell.
   Prudential-Bache has about 2.5 million customers of all
kinds; a "vocal minority" are complaining about partnerships,
says Mr. Schechter. "Where you see people really angered is
when they put an untoward amount of money in {a particular
investment} that didn't work," he says.
   Many customers, including Mrs. Burg, have done just that.
They blame their brokers for committing too much of their
money to partnerships. Mrs. Burg, for her part, last year won
a $45,000 arbitration award against Prudential-Bache from a
National Association of Securities Dealers panel. But she is
unhappy because that is a fraction of what she says her
losses are.
   Prudential-Bache, in a statement, said, "While it's
unfortunate that Mrs. Burg disagrees with an independent
arbitration tribunal, she had submitted her claim before the
NASD, which determined her claim was worth approximately
$45,000 and which entered an award in that amount." The firm
declined further comment.
   Vows Mrs. Burg: "I won't rest until I have full
restitution."
   Meanwhile, the partnership industry continues to contract.
New offerings in the first seven months of this year raised
$2.3 billion from investors, 39% less than a year ago,
according to Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J.,
publishing and consulting firm.
   Shearson, another firm plagued by problems stemming
largely from past real estate offerings, has surged to the
lead in partnership sales, collecting $220 million from
investors through July.
   More than half the money that Shearson and
Prudential-Bache raised this year went into partnerships that
trade commodities. The key feature of most of these
partnerships is a guarantee that investors will at least get
their own money back. Many limited partners in failed real
estate syndications have been stunned to discover they have
lost their principal.
