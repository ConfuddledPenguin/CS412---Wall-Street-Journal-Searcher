   WASHINGTON -- The impact of the Middle East crisis is
starting to be felt in the U.S. economy, raising
manufacturers' costs, thwarting consumer buying and bringing
widespread uncertainty to businesses across the country,
surveys by the 12 district Federal Reserve banks show.
   The surveys were taken in August and September and provide
some of the first broad looks at the impact of Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, which drove up world oil prices and
ignited fears that the already shaky U.S. economy could fall
into a recession.

   While some businesses say the turmoil hasn't affected
them, a variety of others say it has influenced their
activities in the past month and a half.
   In the Southeast, retailers are trimming orders for new
merchandise, anticipating "consumer resistance," according to
economists at the Atlanta Fed. "The general sentiment among
Southeastern retailers is that already weak consumer
confidence has been negatively impacted by the Mideast crisis
and oil price advances during the last six weeks," the
economists reported.
   In the Midwest, steel producers expect higher fuel costs
will further pinch their narrow profit margins, according to
the Cleveland Fed. But because of the weakness in the
economy, the producers say, they can't pass the additional
costs along to consumers.
   In the Mid-Atlantic states from Maryland to the Carolinas,
however, many manufacturers are transferring the burden to
their customers. "Higher oil prices raised manufacturers'
costs and pushed up prices for finished goods," economists at
the Richmond, Va., Fed wrote.
   To cope with higher raw-material prices and transportation
costs, half of the manufacturers surveyed in the Mid-Atlantic
district said they had already raised prices or will do so
soon, while 10% said they will cut employment and one-third
said they will try to trim non-personnel costs.
   Fed officials will use the survey to help guide them when
they meet Oct. 2 to set credit policy for the ensuing six
weeks. Central bank policy makers face some hard choices.
They are under pressure to cushion the weakening economy by
reducing interest rates. But the jump in oil prices that
brought a surge in the country's inflation rate last month
makes them wary of easing credit.
   Overall, the Fed survey depicts an economy that is clearly
deteriorating. Banks continue to tighten lending standards in
many regions. At the same time, loan demand is down at many
institutions. Numerous retailers throughout the country saw
their sales slow down in the past month, and a number of them
find sales below year-earlier levels. Manufacturers' reports
generally range from moderate expansion to decline. And
construction is down just about everywhere.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan pointed to
the regional surveys in testimony before the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress yesterday, saying they show "a greater
caution on the part of firms in the acquisition of capital
goods, in some cases because of increased uncertainty"
produced by the oil shock.
   About half of the manufacturers polled by the Boston Fed
say they have pared capital spending plans or made "judicious
delays" in projects.
   One of the areas where the Persian Gulf situation has
taken a clear toll is consumer attitudes. Local surveys
conducted after the Iraqi invasion -- which spurred a
world-wide trade embargo against Iraq and a U.S.-led buildup
of military forces in neighboring Saudi Arabia -- showed
sharp declines in consumer confidence, according to the
Chicago Fed.
   A panel of forecasters at the Cleveland Fed says the surge
in oil prices, which came after Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil was
forced off the market by the embargo, has weakened the
near-term outlook for consumer spending. Retailers in that
district say price promotions will probably be necessary to
sustain sales over the next several months.
   The oil price shock has affected some home buyers, too. In
the Midwest, where housing markets have been healthier than
in most other regions, sales have softened in recent weeks. A
real estate agent there blames rising mortgage rates and
uncertainty "generated by the Middle East crisis."
   And the Persian Gulf has crept into scattered other
business decisions. Chemical producers in the Southwest are
switching from petroleum-based raw materials to other
products to reduce the impact of rising oil prices, according
to the Dallas Fed. Two manufacturers in the region covered by
the St. Louis Fed say they are tightening credit to Middle
East customers. One has held up shipments of capital-goods
orders to the region until previous bills are paid.
   In the Western states, most businesses say that "the Iraqi
invasion has not yet caused changes in their business plans
beyond a new interest in energy conservation," according to
economists at the San Francisco Fed. One company, however,
has suspended its business with the Middle East, and others
say they are making decisions about capital spending with
increased caution.
