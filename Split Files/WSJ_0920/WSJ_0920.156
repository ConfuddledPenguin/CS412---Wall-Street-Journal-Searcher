   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange said they have formed a joint committee
to explore ways to cut costs and increase efficiency by
unifying certain functions, procedures and operations.
   The committee will focus specifically on the areas of
international marketing, systems development, operations and
clearing, the CBOT and CME said.

   The joint effort is part of "a new era of cooperation,"
said one committee member. The CME and CBOT agreed in
principle this year to become partners in Globex, an
automated after-hours trading system being developed in
conjunction with Reuters Holdings PLC. The two are also
sharing the costs of developing AUDIT, a hand-held computer
terminal for recording trades.
