   Richard D. Hamill, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said the company is "exploring a number of
opportunities including acquisitions" but he declined to be
specific.
   Mr. Hamill said that there is a consolidation in
biotechnology companies and he said the company wants to be a
player. "We want to be one of the acquirers instead of one of
the acquirees," said Mr. Hamill.
