   SAN FRANCISCO -- The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled Wednesday that federal energy officials may pursue
Nevada as a potential nuclear waste dump site, despite the
state Legislature's adamant opposition.
   The uananimous court decision allows government officials
to proceed with a massive environmental study of Nevada's
Yucca Mountain, about one hundreds miles northeast of Las
Vegas, as a burial site for radioactive wastes. The state has
mounted several legal challenges to the federal plan since
1987, and the state Legislature has passed hostile
resolutions and refused to supply the government with
necessary environmental permits.

   The three-judge panel rejected state arguments that the
federal government was violating constitutional protections
of state rights, as well as provisions of the U.S. Nuclear
Waste Policy Act. The state attorney general had argued in
August before the court that Congress failed to override
Nevada's disapproval notice within the 90 days required under
the 1982 act.
   In his decision, federal Judge Arthur Alarcon asserted
that the U.S. energy secretary was correct in arguing that
the U.S. Constitutions's 10th amendment "does not protect a
state from being outvoted in Congress."
   Originally the federal government was considering five
sites in Mississippi, Utah, Texas, Washington and Nevada.
Since 1987, the government has narrowed the list to three --
in Hannaford, Wash., Deafsmith, Texas, and Yucca Mountain --
and more recently dropped all but the Nevada location.
   Nevada can appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court
or ask the appellate court for reconsideration. State Deputy
Attorney General Harry Swainston wouldn't say whether the
state will appeal until he reads the decision. But in August,
state Attorney General Brian McKay vowed "to use every tool
possible" to keep the dump site out of the state.
   The federal energy officials have said that its "site
verification study" would take about six to ten years to
complete. So far, government researchers have bored several
exploratory holes in the mountainside, but their work largely
halted in the face of state resistance.
