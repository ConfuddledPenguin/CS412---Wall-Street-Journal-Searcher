   PITTSBURGH -- National Steel Corp., NKK Corp. of Japan and
Dofasco Inc. of Canada agreed to build a $200 million steel
galvanizing line, in what is believed to be the first
steel-related venture involving three countries.
   The multination project could launch a new round of joint
agreements in the U.S., where such relationships have
consisted mainly of Japanese-American partnerships. "This is
a model for global cooperation and in that sense is an
extremely important milestone," said John Jacobson, an
analyst with AUS Consultants.

   He noted that such ventures should help steelmakers'
viability by reducing the potential for excess capacity,
which has been the industry's nemesis. "There are too many
players for each company to do its own thing," he said.
   The plant, scheduled for completion by early 1993, will
produce about 400,000 tons of hot-dip coated steel annually
for the automotive market. Although a site hasn't been
selected for this venture, the plant will likely be built
along the U.S.-Canadian border, close to auto makers in
Detroit. The site must also be close to National Steel and
Dofasco plants, each of which will supply 50% of the raw
steel.
   High-quality, corrosion resistant coated steel has been
the industry's darling in recent years, with steelmakers
rushing to add lines. The electrogalvanizing coating process
has been considered superior to hot-dip because the first
process covers steel more uniformly, which is essential for
exposed car panels. However, the hot-dip process has improved
in terms of consistency and is making a comeback because it's
cheaper and more flexible.
   The flurry to build coating lines could create a glut in
the next few years. John Lichtenstein, a director at Beddows
Co., an international consulting firm, believes demand for
coated steel will grow for both automotive and construction
markets. Whether supply exceeds demand, he said, depends
largely on the ability of Japanese auto transplants to expand
the U.S. car market, as opposed to supplanting U.S. auto
makers.
   NKK will supply equipment and provide technical and
operational assistance, patterning the plant after one of its
Japanese facilities. Dofasco and National Steel will each
market and distribute one-half of the total output to their
existing automotive customers.
   Dofasco will own 50% of the venture, NKK 40%, and National
Steel, which is 70%-owned by NKK, will own the remaining 10%.
Ben J. Ciprietti, vice president, planning of Dofasco, will
be president, while a NKK director and two National Steel
executives will be directors.
