   FRANKFURT -- Producer prices in East Germany were down 50%
in July from the average for all of 1989, the East German
state news agency ADN reported.
   Citing data from the East German Statistics Office, ADN
said this is the first time East Germany has published
producer price data. Because of the lack of reliable monthly
data for 1989, the year-earlier figures used for comparison
are averages for the entire year.

   As the two Germanys speed toward a merger on Oct. 3, the
East Germans have been scrambling to produce accurate data
that conform as closely as possible to Western economic
reporting standards.
   ADN said the Statistics Office surveyed 1,900 companies
for its price report.
