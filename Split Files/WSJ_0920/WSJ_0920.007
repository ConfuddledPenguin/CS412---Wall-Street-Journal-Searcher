   BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank -- Issa Massad
picks his way across the broken plaster and splintered wood
that has littered his empty office for a year, hunting for
any trace that he was once the leading dental hygienist in
this Christian Arab town.
   "Here was the sterilization unit," says the 34-year-old,
pointing to a cupboard whose door hangs ajar. "This wall is
where I had my drill." Picking up a clipped piece of
electrical cable, he shrugs: "When the Israeli soldiers came
in, they took everything -- except time to unplug the
equipment. They just cut the wires. All they left was this."

   A year ago today, this well-to-do town near Bethlehem was
the center of attention in the Mideast. Beit Sahur was
besieged by Israeli troops because of the unusual manner of
its participation in the "intifada," the Palestinian uprising
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that now has been
going on for almost three years. Many of Beit Sahur's 12,000
people defied the Israeli occupation -- not by throwing
stones, but by refusing to pay their taxes. Their resistance
provoked an army curfew, and ultimately a siege, during which
the army cut all road and telephone links. Only people who
paid their taxes could enter or leave.
   For 42 days, the townspeople didn't budge. On the 43rd
day, Israeli tax collectors assisted by soldiers moved in to
seize property -- from Mr. Massad's dental equipment to cars,
televisions, even socks. About $1.5 million in property was
seized and auctioned off; 40 people were arrested and many
were jailed.
   To the outside world, Beit Sahur illustrated that mass
opposition to the Israeli role in the West Bank spans all
economic classes of Palestinians, including professionals who
have succeeded economically under Israeli rule. And perhaps
because of its sharp contrast with the bus attacks, rock
throwing and other violence of the intifada, Beit Sahur's
nonviolent resistance showed that not everyone who opposed
the occupation was a terrorist.
   A year later, life here is harder. City counsellor Atallah
Rishmawi says the city's economy is half what it was. Nearly
a quarter of the small textile workshops that dotted the town
have closed. Outside the al Sha'ab pharmacy near the small
city hall, groups of unemployed young men gossip and loiter
for hours.
   Nonetheless, people here say resistance to Israeli rule is
hardening. Though Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has pushed the
uprising to the back pages, people in Beit Sahur say they are
determined to continue their tax boycott.
   "They destroyed my business. They took my television. They
put me in prison. But still I continue to fight," says Mr.
Massad. "This is war. People are just as determined to resist
as ever, and to assist in the intifada. Nothing has been
resolved."
   Beit Sahur has been energized by Saddam Hussein's takeover
of Kuwait. People say they support Mr. Hussein because he is
the only Arab strong enough to defy their principal foreign
enemy, the U.S. At a building-supplies shop, which stocks
only half as much as it once did, a plumber named Tewfik puts
it simply: "Saddam is good, the Americans no. You are either
with us Arabs, or you are against us."
   Beit Sahur is a potent reminder that the situation that
led to the intifada hasn't been resolved. Though Israeli
officials quietly press the point that they accurately warned
the world long ago about Saddam Hussein's territorial
ambitions, the Israelis have a lingering problem in their own
backyard, on territory taken in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
And while observers say the intifada is in a quiet phase,
violence on either side could make it erupt again.
   "The intifada is definitely not over," says Keith Kyle, a
Mideast specialist at London's Royal Institute of
International Affairs. "It may have quieted somewhat due to
less arrogant Israeli policing and more internal Palestinian
bickering and fatigue. But I don't think {the Palestinians'}
sheer determination has been weakened."
   Beit Sahur, whose sun-parched buildings of pale flintstone
rise from ancient Judean hills, seems an unlikely place for a
revolt. Biblical scholars say this is the tranquil spot where
shepherds were awakened by an angel to Jesus's birth in
Bethlehem. The once-prosperous merchants wear Baume &amp; Mercier
watches and drive Fords, like city counsellor Rishmawi, a
leader of the tax revolt.
   But while their feet are firmly on the ground, their
hearts and minds are elsewhere. "We want to be free. Why
should we pay for our own occupation?" asks Mr. Rishmawi.
Before the siege, he says, "We were called the Japan of
Palestine. We calculate we lost a total of $5 million in the
siege, both in lost material and lost business." He leafs
through Arabic ledgers documenting the seized property. "We
have less to lose now," he says.
   People credit the international outcry over Beit Sahur as
one of the factors in lightening the Israelis' hand in the
territories. While the current Israeli government is
considered among the most hawkish in more than 40 years,
Defense Minister Moshe Arens's policy of "avoiding
unnecessary friction" has led to an easing of tension and a
sharp drop in the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis.
   Indeed, while nearly 1,000 people have been killed in the
33 months since the uprising began, the balance has shifted:
The number of Palestinians killed by other Palestinians is
rising quickly, and the number killed by Israeli troops is
declining. Last month, intra-Palestinian fatalities in the
occupied territories totaled 41, more than four times the
number killed by Israeli troops. "Obviously, the intifada
isn't over, but we think our policy is working," says an
Israeli official.
   Still, the Palestinians are far from united. "We are very
troubled by the high rate of killing" in internal Palestinian
clashes, says a Palestinian spokesman in Jerusalem. Despite
claims that most murdered Palestinians are Israeli
collaborators, it isn't clear how strong intifada leaders'
control is. And some activists want to switch from stones to
bullets.
   But in Beit Sahur, regardless of the bickering among
Palestinians, the bad feelings generated by the tax siege
appear to guarantee continued resistance.
   Naila Hayek Rishmawi, a secretary, recalls that when the
patrol came to arrest her husband after the siege, her
two-year-old daughter Nadine burst into tears, crying "PLO
yes, Israel no."
