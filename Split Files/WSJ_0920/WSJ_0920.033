   Bondholders of Gillett Holdings Inc. have snubbed the
company's debt-restructuring plan, even though Gillett is
offering some creditors a possible 49% stake in its
television stations.
   Gillett has been trying to restructure its debt since Aug.
1, when it missed an interest payment due on $251 million of
high-yield junk bonds. Gillett incurred a $34 million
first-quarter loss and hasn't issued public financial
statements since then. The Denver company, which operates TV
stations, ski resorts and meat-packing plants, has $983
million in debt outstanding.

   A confidential memo to bondholders shows that Gillett is
offering a package of cash and new junk bonds of lower value
in exchange for its existing junk bonds. Gillett's bonds
currently are quoted as low as 14 cents on the dollar.
   But so far, Gillett hasn't won much support for its debt
plan. Gillett told bondholders this week that none of the
holders of its Series A, B and C zero-coupon bond issues
tendered their bonds in the company's exchange offer. Gillett
had been seeking to gain as much as 90% acceptance from those
classes of bondholders.
   Some $213 million of Series A, B and C bonds are
outstanding. Bondholders and advisers to the company say
those bonds are largely held by First Executive Corp. and
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association. Executives at First
Executive and Columbia declined comment.
   Gillett's debt-restructuring plan isn't getting much
support from other bondholders either, according to a memo
from the company's law firm, Winston &amp; Strawn. Some 34% of
holders of the company's 13 7/8% subordinated debentures
tendered their bonds by a deadline of midnight Monday. That
was well below the 64% acceptance sought by the company.
   In an earlier version of its debt restructuring plan,
Gillett didn't offer bondholders any equity in its
businesses. But this time, holders of some bonds are being
offered warrants convertible into 49% ownership of Gillett's
TV stations in Tampa, Fla.; Santa Barbara, Calif., and
Salinas, Calif. The warrants would be exercisable if the
company doesn't redeem various bonds by 1992, bondholders
said.
   Gillett, which is owned by Denver businessman George
Gillett, "may be forced to give up some more equity to get
the deal done," says Jeff Evans, a ratings officer at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Bondholders in particular are
focusing on the company's most-prized assets, its Vail,
Colo., ski resorts.
   For the time being, bondholders say, Gillett has extended
its existing bond-exchange offer until later this month. The
company and Mr. Gillett didn't return phone calls seeking
comment.
