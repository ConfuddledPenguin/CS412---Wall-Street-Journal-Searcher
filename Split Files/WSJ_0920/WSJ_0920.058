   At Best, They've Proved There's
   More Than One Kind of Yo-Yo

   With crime bordering on an obsession in New York City, the
district attorney's office is having its ups and downs.
   Take the case of William Thigpen, a 37-year-old homeless
man who was arrested last December. The charge? Selling
yo-yos on a midtown Manhattan sidewalk without a license.

   The Manhattan district attorney's office geared up to
prosecute the case, but its efforts were thwarted initially
by criminal-court Judge John E.H. Stackhouse. Noting that the
arrest occurred close to Christmas and Hanukkah, Judge
Stackhouse charitably dismissed the case.
   But that wasn't the end of it for the prosecutor's office,
which promptly appealed, arguing that "the spirit of the
holidays" was hardly a sufficient ground to let Mr. Thigpen
off the hook. The court's appellate division agreed and
ordered Judge Stackhouse to rehear the case.
   Earlier this week, the judge ruled once more in the
long-running saga. Again he dismissed the case, and this time
he was really wound up. In his opinion, Judge Stackhouse said
the police could perhaps find "a more socially useful
purpose" than busting yo-yo dealers.
   The judge said he doubted whether a conviction would deter
other unlicensed yo-yo vendors if they somehow learned about
the case. And he said it was unlikely that dismissing the
case of one unlicensed yo-yo vendor would affect the welfare
of the general public.
   In fact, the judge suggested, with violent crime rampant,
"the public's confidence is more likely to be diminished by
the amount of time and expense already expended on Mr.
Thigpen's prosecution."
   A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office says the
office still disagrees with Judge Stackhouse's decision --
although it plans no further appeal. "This is a
quality-of-life crime," she says.
   Granted, New York's quality of life has taken some knocks
in recent weeks. Time magazine trumpeted the decline of New
York on a recent cover. And the magazine commissioned a poll
that showed the majority of New Yorkers would prefer to live
somewhere else.
   So where does New York Mayor David Dinkins stand on the
issue of yo-yo offenders? He's backing the prosecutors.
   A spokesman for the mayor says the case goes beyond
yo-yos. After all, he says, if people are left free to sell
whatever they want on street corners, why would retailers
want to rent space in the city?
