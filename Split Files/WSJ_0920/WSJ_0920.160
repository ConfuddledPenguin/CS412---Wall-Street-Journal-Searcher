   CLEVELAND -- Lubrizol Corp. said a Canadian federal court
ruled that Exxon Corp.'s Canadian affiliate infringed on a
Lubrizol patent for certain lubricants and additives.
   The court permanently enjoined the Exxon unit from making,
using and selling about 20 additives and the finished
lubricants containing them. A temporary injunction has been
in effect since January 1989.

   The court also ruled that Lubrizol, a specialty chemical
company, is entitled to court costs and damages for the
infringement. The amount will be decided by a court-appointed
referee at a date to be determined later.
