   PLAINVIEW, N.Y. -- Astrex Inc. began reassessing its
accounting procedures after reporting that Ronald S. Kass,
its president and chief executive officer, charged at least
$150,000 in personal expenses to the company.
   Mr. Kass, who resigned as chief financial officer of the
electronics parts distribution company, "has acknowledged
causing such payments to be made for his personal benefit,"
the company said, and has agreed to make restitution.

   The company said the payments had been made over 2 1/2
years, in payments Mr. Kass caused to be made to third
parties; many of the payments were classified for accounting
purposes as capital assets. The total amount of the payments
hasn't been determined. Mr. Kass is continuing to serve as
chief executive and president at his base salary, although
his employment contract has been terminated, now making him
an "employee at will."
   Astrex directors said they believe "it is in the best
interests of the company for Mr. Kass to remain employed."
   Astrex said the $150,000 represents less than 3% of the
company's assets, but noted that "there is currently no
assurance" that Mr. Kass's acts "will not adversely affect
the company."
   An audit committee of the board and an independent
accounting firm have been investigating the matter since
August. Mark Schindler, a director, said no criminal
investigation is under way. "It's not likely that this will
go that far," he said. The committee will report next week on
the total amount involved and whether any further action will
be taken against Mr. Kass, who has been with the company for
more than 20 years.
   Mr. Kass and his attorneys at Jacobson &amp; Mermelstein in
New York declined to comment.
   Mr. Schindler said that the board decided to retain Mr.
Kass as an employee because he "is a key man in the
electronic connector business" and is "familiar with all
the matters of the company."
   Separately, Astrex reported that on Sept. 1, it failed to
pay interest of approximately $425,000 due on $8.8 million of
9.5% debentures due Sept. 2000.
   Astrex distributes over 25,000 electronic parts and
components to about 4,000 customers, chiefly in the Northeast
region. Astrex had a net loss of $355,000 or 33 cents a share
on revenue of $4.3 million for the fiscal first quarter ended
June 30.
