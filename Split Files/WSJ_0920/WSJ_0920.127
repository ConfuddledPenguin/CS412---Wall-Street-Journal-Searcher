   DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia -- Senior U.S. military officers are
pushing to keep a permanent force of nearly 10,000 American
troops in this country and to secure air bases throughout the
Persian Gulf after the current crisis is resolved.
   According to senior military officers here and in
Washington, the Army and Air Force are quietly drafting
long-term plans to stay in the gulf in force. The plans also
call for leaving behind huge stockpiles of U.S. weapons and
equipment for use in any future emergency.

   But in Washington, top civilian officials at the Pentagon
and elsewhere in the Bush administration strongly denied that
there is a U.S. policy to establish a permanent presence
here. Their comments could presage an internal battle over
what to do when the crisis with Iraq ends, pitting the
uniformed military against civilian leaders.
   Asked about the military planning, chief Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams said flatly: "We have no intention of
doing that." He added, "We've been too busy dealing with the
crisis at hand. No one has been authorized to do any planning
beyond that."
   Mr. Williams said, "Maybe somebody is spinning out some
eventuality. The Pentagon is a big place, and there are lots
of people in the Pentagon who think they have the big
picture. But as far as I know, there is no such plan." State
Department officials, who have repeatedly denied any interest
in a permanent ground presence here, expressed similar
surprise and dismay at the officers' planning.
   Military officers said the plans haven't been approved by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Chairman Colin Powell of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, or President Bush. But the planning is
being handled at a high level in the Army, including some
officers on the staff of Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl Vuono.
And Saudi officials said the issue has been discussed
informally with them.
   The Saudis, for their part, appear lukewarm about the
idea. "We have strongly resisted such a step over the years,"
noted one Saudi official familiar with the latest
discussions. "But that's clearly what the {U.S.} Army wants,
and the opposition may be reduced this time."
   Even informal talk about permanent bases -- a goal the
U.S. has sought for years -- could make Arab allies nervous
and strain the coalition against Iraq.
   Nevertheless, the Army's leadership is quietly drafting
plans to maintain at least a heavy mechanized brigade and
support forces here indefinitely, according to the officers.
That would total 7,000 or 8,000 troops, and the Army wants to
leave enough hardware on the ground here to support five or
six times that many troops in case of another crisis.
   The Air Force, meanwhile, hopes to win permanent bases in
Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, according to
military planners. And the Marines are beating the drums to
have more of their tanks and other weapons placed on
permanent floating storage sites in the Middle East.
   The Pentagon's efforts contradict public signals by the
Bush administration. Just last Friday, on a visit to Syria,
Secretary of State Baker declared that "We have no intention
or desire to establish a permanent military ground presence
in this region." After initially hinting that a new "regional
security structure" for the Middle East might involve U.S.
troops, Mr. Baker repeatedly has said any U.S. contribution
would be likely to be limited to the naval forces the U.S.
has maintained in and near the gulf for 40 years.
   Separately, administration officials said they believe
that 15 pro-Iranian terrorists, whose fate has been linked to
that of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon, are in Iran or on their
way there. The terrorists, who were being held by Kuwait for
a series of 1983 bombings, include the brother-in-law of a
kidnapper who holds two U.S. hostages in Lebanon and has
demanded that the group be freed in exchange for the U.S.
hostages.
   With the prisoners in Iranian hands, another release of
U.S. hostages might be possible. But administration officials
aren't expecting anything soon.
   Meanwhile, Iraq announced that it is confiscating assets
of nations that are participating in economic sanctions
against Iraq. The order applies to assets of U.S. companies
doing business in Iraq. The U.S. government didn't have any
immediate estimate of the value of U.S. assets involved. The
total probably isn't great, though.
   "It is not clear from the Iraqi statement in what form or
against whom the action will be taken," said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. "In any case, actions like
this can only make it more difficult for Iraq to return to
the international community of nations and to restore
economic relations which are crucial for Iraq's long-term
development."
   Meanwhile, the State Department said all Americans who
wish to leave Iraq and Kuwait, and who have been permitted to
do so by Iraqi authorities, will be flown out by Saturday.
Some Americans have chosen to stay, and many others -- mainly
men -- are being refused permission to go.
