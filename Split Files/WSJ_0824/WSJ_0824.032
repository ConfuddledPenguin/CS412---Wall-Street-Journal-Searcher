   A team of scientists halted the growth of colon cancer
cells in a test tube by replacing a damaged gene with its
normal version.
   The experiment supports a new theory that certain genes
normally prevent uncontrolled, malignant cell growth and that
cancer arises when these "tumor suppressor" genes are damaged
or inactivated.

   Cancer researchers say that if they can discover how these
tumor suppressor genes work, they might learn how to stop the
growth of cancers. They might also devise tests for
determining whether a person has a defective tumor suppressor
gene and is therefore susceptible to cancer.
   The finding is the most important yet to come from a small
group of researchers at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in
Baltimore; they have spent six years searching for the
genetic chain reaction that initiates cancer growth. The
team, led by Bert Vogelstein, previously had identified
certain genes that normally regulate cell reproduction and
growth as key components of the chain reaction.
   Based on the Hopkins research and similar studies
elsewhere, scientists now believe that a cancer erupts if a
series of these tumor suppressor genes are damaged or somehow
altered. Thus, cancer researchers have hoped that inserting a
normal version of one or more of the genes back into a
cancerous cell might stop the cell's aberrant behavior.
   In a report published in this week's Science magazine, Dr.
Vogelstein and his colleagues showed that one of these genes,
called p53, could do just that, reversing malignant activity
of cells from a colon cancer tumor. Although the researchers
previously showed that a fully developed tumor cell contains
several different altered genes, "it appears that p53 by
itself" can return cells to normal growth, Dr. Vogelstein
said.
   "The normal p53 gene is what we hoped it might be, a
powerful inhibitor of colon cancer cell growth," Dr.
Vogelstein said. "The next step, of course, is to find out
exactly how the gene normally exerts this control. When we do
that, we'll have uncovered the pathway of a cancer, and,
hopefully, we can find ways to disrupt that pathway. But
finding how the gene works is going to be just as hard as
finding the gene in the first place," he said.
   The experiment "is an important step forward," said John
Minna, a chief cancer investigator at National Cancer
Institute who is studying the role of p53 and other tumor
suppressor genes in the genesis of lung cancer. "Several
laboratories are attempting to do the exact same experiment
involving cells from other types of tumors. We expect p53 to
play the same role in those cancers, too." He noted that
researchers at Temple University in Philadelphia recently
found that re-introducing a normal p53 gene could halt the
growth of brain cancer cells dividing in a test tube.
   Dr. Vogelstein and his colleagues first identified p53's
role in colon cancer early last year. Since then, the Hopkins
team and other researchers have found that the gene was
missing or damaged in cells in tumors of the brain, breast,
lung and bone. Every cell in the body contains two copies of
every gene. But the researchers have found that full-blown
tumors are missing one copy of the p53 gene and that the
second copy is very slightly mutated. Cells missing one copy
but still containing a second normal copy of the gene rarely
become cancerous. "One of our big questions, of course, is
how the one copy disappears and the other is damaged," Dr.
Minna said. "Research needs to be done to see if some people
inherit genetic material with the gene missing or damaged. If
that's true, then it would prove that a susceptibility to the
cancer can be inherited. We also want to show what can damage
the genes later in life because that would identify exactly
what kinds of things cause cancer."
   Dr. Vogelstein said tests still must be conducted to show
that replacing the damaged p53 in the body can squelch the
cancer. "I don't think it's feasible to actually replace the
gene," he said.
   The p53 gene, like all genes, acts by triggering a cell to
produce a protein. Dr. Vogelstein's team believes the damaged
p53 produces a mutant protein that distorts normal cell
action. The Hopkins researchers are studying how this protein
interacts with other genes or proteins in the cell, thus
illuminating the chain of events by which the cancer evolves.
   Several drug companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a unit of Roche Holding Ltd., are
trying to develop drugs that would disrupt this chain.
   The latest Hopkins research was carried out by Dr.
Vogelstein, Suzanne Baker and Eric Fearon, along with Sanford
Markowitz and James Willson at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.
