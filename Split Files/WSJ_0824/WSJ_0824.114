   LOS ANGELES -- U.S. Attorney Lourdes G. Baird charged
Michael S. Moers, the former chairman of the board and
coowner of the now-defunct Brookside Savings &amp; Loan
Association, with four federal felony counts.
   The lawsuit charges Mr. Moers, 39 years old, once a close
associate of the also-defunct Westwood Savings &amp; Loan
Association, with criminal conduct in three separate
transactions.

   Westwood Savings and Brookside Savings, both of Los
Angeles, were taken over by federal regulators in 1986 and
1989, respectively, and are among the failed thrifts being
investigated by the Department of Justice and Office of
Thrift Supervision.
   The charges allege that Mr. Moers secretly sold his
interest in a San Antonio, Texas, apartment complex to
Brookside Savings. They allege that Mr. Moers concealed his
interest in the property from savings and loan regulators by
using a straw man to pose as the seller of the property and
funnel proceeds to Mr. Moers.
   The lawsuit also alleges that Mr. Moers, who resides in
Los Angeles, together with his associates at Westwood
Savings, owned an option to buy a large piece of prime real
estate in West Los Angeles. It alleges he sold it to the two
savings and loan associations and concealed his interest in
the property from federal regulators by using a straw man.
   And, the lawsuit alleges that Mr. Moers secretly received
consulting fees that Westwood Savings owed him through
another straw man.
   An attorney for Mr. Moers, Robert Silverman, declined to
comment on the charges.
   The four charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison and a $265,000 fine. Mr. Moers will be arraigned
Monday.
