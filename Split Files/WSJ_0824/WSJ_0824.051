   NEW YORK -- Thousands of nurses in the U.S., fed up with
low pay, long hours and arrogant doctors, are setting up
their own businesses.
   For Corrie Brouwer, single mother of five, the moment of
truth came when she got her tax forms. "I was working 75 or
80 hours a week as a staff nurse and coming up with $50,000 a
year. It was ridiculous." Her frustration grew when she was
asked to keep an eye on temporary nurses supplied by agencies
who earned more than she did. The final straw was a tax bill
of $20,000. "I asked myself: Is this what I have to look
forward to?" she recalls.

   It wasn't. In March of 1988, she and fellow nurse Mary
Pawar set up Critical Difference Inc. in Fairfield, N.J.,
that they say places "elite" nurses in hospitals. It had
revenue of $1 million in its first year and $1.4 million in
the second year. Now, the partners plan to set up a second
company, Critical Connection, that will provide medical
services in patients' homes. They are confident they will
have no problems finding skilled nurses willing to leave
hospital employment to join their pool of independent
contractors. "Nurses working more than five years have had it
with the hospital politics and low pay," says Mrs. Pawar.
"There are too many avenues open to them."
   Mrs. Pawar and Mrs. Brouwer are among a growing number of
nurse entrepreneurs in this country. Not so many years ago,
nurses were sometimes expected to stand if a doctor entered a
room. Today, they may walk out of hospital wards into
businesses of their own instead. Many establish
nursing-placement agencies or set up their own practices, but
the list of specialties is almost endless, and includes
pharmaceutical distribution, day care for the aged,
performance reviews of hospitals and mobile dialysis.
Collectively, they are helping to change the face of health
care in America.
   "The whole decade of the 1980s was entrepreneurial, and
now nurses are following suit," says David Norris, head of
the National Nurses in Business Association of Petaluma,
Calif. He estimates the number of nurses who have established
their own businesses doubled in the past decade, to 20,000.
Membership of his own association has shot up to 700 from 200
when it got started two years ago, he says.
   Another group that is growing fast is the American
Association of Nurse Attorneys. Set up in 1982, it now has
more than 500 members. Typically, they chose a second career
in law out of frustration at the limited advancement
opportunities of their original profession. Its treasurer,
Karen Guarino, one of 15 attorneys in the healthlaw
department of Ober, Kaler, Grimes &amp; Shriver of Baltimore, had
risen in the nursing ranks and opened a medical-oncology unit
in a general hospital in Houston. Despite her success, she
grew restless.
   "In nursing, you begin to repeat yourself, and I wanted to
grow," she says. She remembers "standing at my kitchen sink
thinking, what am I going to do now?"
   Sheer exhaustion does some nurses in. Laura Gasparis
Vonfrolio returned home from one of two nursing jobs a few
years back and wondered whether "I was ever going to see my
name in lights." Impulsively, she fired off letters to two
brokerage firms she picked at random, calling herself the
president of CPR Associates and offering to train their
employees in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Two weeks later, she got a call from someone identifying
herself as Merrill Lynch. Her first thought: "Why would any
mother name her kid Merrill?" Then the woman asked if she
could start classes for 545 people as soon as possible. She
managed to organize classes within three weeks and netted
$2,000 in five days. "I've been in business ever since," she
says.
   Mrs. Gasparis Vonfrolio has started several other
ventures, including Education Enterprises Inc., which
organizes seminars, and a publication company that is
assembling a book of essays covering nurses' grievances
against their profession.
   The exodus of nurses to entrepreneurship worries the
medical establishment, already coping with a severe national
shortage of working nurses. But some nurse entrepreneurs
claim their activities are easing the shortage, which leaves
one in 10 hospital vacancies unfilled. Nurse-owned placement
agencies, for example, which offer higher pay and more
flexible scheduling than staff jobs while skipping fringe
benefits, are luring back some of the roughly 400,000 nurses
-- one in five of the total -- who have left the work force.
   Says Pamela Maraldo, executive director of the National
League for Nursing, based in New York: "Hospitals are being
overused and we don't have enough health care in the home.
That's where nurses come in. They see people's needs aren't
being met and they set up businesses to meet them.
Physicians' days of sovereignty are over."
   Nurses often find that one business spawns another. Five
years ago, Lannie Liggett was hired by a fellow nurse,
William Borne, to help expand a provisional staffing agency
for health-care facilities, Analytical Medical Enterprises,
in Baton Rouge, La. Already, they have set up 24 regional
offices in 12 states, and this year expect revenues to
approach $20 million.
   But the pair didn't stop there. They have launched eight
affiliated businesses, including a contract-anesthesia
company, an office-management company for physicians and a
traveling-nurse company. The most unusual venture is a
Cajun-food catering service that got started when the company
agreed to handle a party as a publicity stunt and then
couldn't find an affordable caterer. That offshoot has
produced its own offshoot, a seafood processing factory.
   Meanwhile, the proliferation of medical-malpractice and
product-liability lawsuits has given rise to liability-advice
firms. Doreen Wise says revenue at her Medical Research
Consultants in Houston, which does research for attorneys'
personal-injury and malpractice cases, has doubled every year
for four years, hitting $600,000 last year. Though much of
her business comes from plaintiff lawyers, she figures her
expertise helps keep their clients' legal fees down.
   "We have lots of doctors who work with us who would never
have anything to do with most lawyers," she says. "We're
trading on our clinical experience."
   While many nurses gripe about working conditions,
dissatisfaction of another kind gnawed at operating-room
nurse Nancy Gorski. "I was upset by some of the things I was
seeing," she says. For example, she says, she was "horrified"
that some anesthesiologists merely rinsed off the blades of
laryngoscopes that are inserted into patients' mouths. Even
scrubbing the devices doesn't kill all the germs, but
sterilizing the blades can ruin them, she says.
   Ms. Gorski set up a research-and-development firm in
Camarillo, Calif., called Gorsk Inc. to come up with
infection-control products. It recently licensed the patent
for a disposable latex sheath for the laryngoscope blades. It
is also in the final stages of negotiating licensing rights
to a multinational corporation for special receptacles for
sponges used during surgery, she says.
   To be sure, the great majority of nurses still work as
employees of hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions.
Many love the work. The pay is getting better, with average
maximum salaries for staff nurses rising 9.9% last year to
$35,300. Enrollments at nursing schools, which slumped to
183,000 in 1987 from a peak of 251,000 in 1983, are picking
up, increasing 8.9% last year to 201,000. And many hospitals
are trying to increase opportunities for nurses.
   One statistic remains stubbornly unfavorable, however: the
"salary progression" that measures the difference between an
occupation's average starting salary and average maximum
salary. For accountants, the progression is 209%, for
attorneys, 226%, and for engineers, 184%. For nurses, it is
69%. "I had dead-ended salary-wise at age 27," says Gail
Wick. "My motivation wasn't money-oriented, but still, this
was a dismal thought." She left her career in nursing and
went on to establish Gail Wick &amp; Associates, a consulting and
placement firm in Atlanta.
