   Sun Microsystems Inc. is reconsidering its plan to raise
about $150 million through a stock sale.
   A final decision on whether to cancel the offering hasn't
been made. "It's a day-to-day decision," said William
Raduchel, chief financial officer.

   The Mountain View, Calif., computer maker announced the
offering 10 days ago, when its stock was trading at $32 a
share. Sun had been seeking $31 for each of the new shares,
but since the announcement the price of Sun's stock has
dropped sharply. It closed yesterday at $26.375, up 37.5
cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
   Given the price decline, Sun's board, which must approve
the sale of 5.9 million new shares, is having second thoughts
about the offering. "We have said from the first that this
(offering) is a question of price," Mr. Raduchel said.
   Some analysts charge that Sun pushed its luck by proposing
the offering just a week after announcing plans to sell,
under a long-running agreement, 4.6 million newly issued
shares to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   "I certainly question whether (Sun's) investment bankers
are serving them well," said Robert Herwick, an analyst at
Hambrecht &amp; Quist. "There's nothing that Sun's articulated
that suggests they couldn't have waited three or six months
before coming to market."
   The offering is being managed by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
Salomon Brothers Inc. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   People close to the situation say Sun's investment bankers
are urging that the offering be carried out, citing a belief
that the market for high-technology issues will cool even
further in the coming months.
   Still, Sun may well be in a no-win situation, because even
if it cancels the offering it can't rid investors of the
expectation of further dilution in Sun's stock down the road.
   "Sun is kind of stuck," said David Pearl, a portfolio
manager at Bankers Trust New York Corp. "They can call off
the offering, but they have to raise money and may only be
back again in six months." In the meantime, Mr. Pearl already
is factoring the offering into his Sun earnings forecasts.
   Mr. Raduchel said Sun can't proceed with the offering
until Tuesday at the earliest because its underwriters traded
in outstanding shares of the stock yesterday, and under
securities rules the offering can't commence for two working
days. The company completed its "road show" for the offering
this week and was ready to start it yesterday.
   Separately, Sun announced the resignation of Robert Kavner
from its board. Mr. Kavner, who is AT&amp;T's group executive for
data systems and federal systems, said AT&amp;T no longer will
maintain a seat on Sun's board even though it owns nearly 20%
of Sun's stock.
   Mr. Kavner said Sun and AT&amp;T will continue to work closely
on software and other technical issues but that the two
companies "find themselves competing in the marketplace,
raising potential conflicts of interest."
