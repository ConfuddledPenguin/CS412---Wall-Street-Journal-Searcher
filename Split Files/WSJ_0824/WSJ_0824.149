   NEW YORK -- CBS News President David W. Burke was fired,
thrusting the embattled news division into another period of
uncertainty, with possible layoffs.
   Mr. Burke, 54 years old, was forced out by CBS Inc.
President Laurence A. Tisch only two years after he was hired
to guide CBS News out of a long period of turmoil. He clashed
often with top management, most recently over the news
division's ballooning budget, his own autonomy and the
suspension of commentator Andy Rooney. Mr. Burke will be
succeeded by Eric Ober, 48, who is president of the CBS-owned
television stations division.

   Mr. Ober, a highly regarded executive who has been a vice
president in the news division, faces a daunting job. He must
revive CBS's nightly newscast, which has fallen significantly
in ratings, and steer CBS News back to journalistic dominance
in an era of shrinking financial resources and limited
patience by top management.
   The CBS News budget already is running far in excess of
spending targets for this year. As of Aug. 18, the division
already had spent about $300 million -- its spending plan for
all of 1990, according to insiders. Two years ago that figure
for an entire year was deemed so extravagant by Mr. Tisch
that he ordered a round of budget cuts and the layoff of 215
CBS News employees.
   But Mr. Ober, Brooklyn-born and educated at Yale, said he
hasn't been given any mandate to cut the division's annual
budget. "My top priority," Mr. Ober said, "is letting the
news organization go about covering the news. No one has
discussed anything about budgets with me. They've only
discussed the job."
   Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group and
Mr. Burke's predecessor at CBS News, declined to say what
measures CBS will take to offset the spending splurge this
year. CBS News, with about 1,370 employees, is the largest of
the three network news operations.
   But Mr. Stringer said questions about possible layoffs and
spending cuts were "unfair" because of a pending review of
the budget for next year. However, he said that he was
"totally confident" that the 1991 budget will be "larger than
ever."
   Mr. Burke, who shielded himself from CBS News employees
and the press during much of his tenure, didn't return calls
to his office and home. His abrupt dismissal contrasted
sharply with his arrival July 13, 1988, when he left the No.
2 job at ABC News and was welcomed warmly by CBS's Mr. Tisch
at a packed news conference, while cameras flashed. Mr. Tisch
said then that he finally had the right management team in
place, two full years after acquiring control of the
broadcast company.
   But yesterday, senior CBS officials went out of their way
to say they had forced Mr. Burke out, rather than let him
leave of his own accord. Insisting on anonymity, they said
while the news budget was the most recent sticking point, Mr.
Burke's abrupt exit also stems from what they contend was "a
lack of leadership" and continual clashes with CBS brass,
including senior vice president Jay Kriegel.
   "You have to earn independence," said one senior CBS
official. "Burke wanted it immediately."
   In a statement, Mr. Burke said, "It is clear to me,
following amicable discussions with the management of CBS,
that they would be more comfortable about the future of the
news division under new leadership. They have a right to make
that decision, and I intend fully to cooperate in transition
of leadership responsibilities."
   Mr. Burke often didn't inform executives at Black Rock,
CBS's corporate headquarters, of such major moves as hiring
away Paula Zahn from rival ABC -- at a salary of $1 million
-- to co-anchor "CBS This Morning." He also made it clear
that he didn't want his predecessor and boss, Mr. Stringer,
roaming the halls of the CBS News building, where Mr.
Stringer spent his entire career.
   Mr. Ober, however, has close working relationships with
senior executives at headquarters. And, while Mr. Burke
didn't rub shoulders with CBS News staffers, Mr. Ober is
well-liked and gregarious. When he walks through any of the
five CBS-owned stations (he has worked at three of them) he
is given something akin to a hero's welcome.
   His open style belies a reputation as a shrewd businessman
and tough negotiator with on-air talent and syndicators of
television shows.
   The decision to oust Mr. Burke came last week. "This was
building up," said one CBS executive. The firing was imposed
in the midst of a major news story -- the conflict in Iraq --
because "that conflict could go on for four years. We had to
move at CBS News," the executive said.
   Mr. Stringer said he and Mr. Ober, a 24-year CBS veteran,
had talked about the management shift with CBS News anchor
Dan Rather, who was in Saudi Arabia yesterday, "and Eric has
Dan's full support."
   Mr. Ober said he plans no major changes for the "CBS
Evening News with Dan Rather," despite its slipping to second
place in the ratings behind "ABC World News Tonight with
Peter Jennings," which has been a solid No. 1 for 33 weeks.
"I would hope to expand CBS News in terms of prime-time
shows," Mr. Ober said, "but first things first. My intention
is to go in and help" the nightly newscast.
   Mr. Stringer concurred: "It's no fun being No. 2."
