   SAN FRANCISCO -- The Pacific Stock Exchange and the Taiwan
Stock Exchange said they plan a sister-exchange agreement
aimed at promoting global investment.
   Lee Korins, chairman of the Pacific Stock Exchange, said
he hopes the new, more formal ties will eventually make it
easier for American investors to tap into the lucrative yet
volatile Taiwanese stock market, and for Taiwanese investors
to buy U.S. equities.

   Currently, American investors interested in investing in
Taiwanese companies can only do so by buying a few mutual
funds. "We are trying to build some bridges, and to explore
opportunities to trade each other's products," said Mr.
Korins.
   For the Taipei-based exchange, the sister-exchange
agreement offers a way to improve its settlement and
regulatory capabilities, Mr. Korins said.
