   NEW YORK -- Program trading accounted for 7.8% of New York
Stock Exchange volume, or 15.1 million shares a day, in the
week ended Aug. 10.
   That was down from 8.4%, or 17.5 million shares a day,
from the previous week, the Big Board said in its weekly
report on the computer-aided, multistock trading strategies.

   The biggest program traders for the week, accounting for
58% of the total, were General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody
Group Inc., at 12.4 million shares; Morgan Stanley Group
Inc., 11.9 million; Susquehanna Investment Group, 6.9
million; CS First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp., 6.6
million; and Bear Stearns Cos., 6.4 million.
   In the first hour of trading on Aug. 6, when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunged 85.95 points, firms reporting the
most program trades were Morgan Stanley, Susquehanna, Bear
Stearns and American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc., the latter three all completely on the sell side.
   Program trading is the purchase or sale of a basket of at
least 15, and often hundreds, of stocks having a total value
of at least $1 million. Stock-index arbitrage, which
accounted for 52.6% of program trading in the week ended Aug.
10, involves stock purchases and sales with offsetting trades
in futures and options. More than half of all index-arbitrage
trading was accounted for by Kidder, Susquehanna and Bear
Stearns.
