   WASHINGTON -- As the U.S. headed toward a crucial test
today in its war of nerves with Saddam Hussein, the Bush
administration coordinated a multinational effort to provide
aid to some nations that are being hurt by the embargo of
Iraq.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in an interview yesterday
on ABC television, warned the Iraqi leader that it would be
"a mistake" to follow through on his threat to close Western
embassies today in Kuwait.

   "We don't recognize the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and I
think most of us are determined to keep our embassies open,"
Mr. Cheney said.
   But it appeared that the U.S. wants to avoid a military
clash at its Kuwait embassy. The administration said the
embassy's Marine guards had left Wednesday night with other
officials and dependents in a convoy that arrived yesterday
in Baghdad; State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the U.S had "received assurances" that the embassy personnel
would be free to depart Baghdad.
   Mr. Boucher emphasized that the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait,
W. Nathaniel Howell and enough embassy staff "to take care of
those functions that they have to do there" -- primarily
helping Americans trapped in the country -- would remain. A
State Department official said the embassy staff had been
reduced to 10 people from 120.
   An Iraqi official, in an interview published in the French
daily Le Figaro, said Iraq would consider it the "equivalent
of an act of aggression" if the Western embassies remain
open.
   Iraq attempted to balance those threatening words by
releasing a staged videotape showing Saddam Hussein meeting
with a group of Western hostages, including women and
children. Patting the head of a child standing beside him,
the Iraqi president said he cared about the hostages'
well-being and was keeping them in Iraq in order to keep
peace. He then posed for a group picture with them.
   Mr. Boucher called the performance "shameful theater."
   Iraq also has pulled back its elite Republican Guards
units from Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia and replaced
them with backup forces, NBC News reported. A State
Department official said the move appeared to be a troop
rotation since the overall Iraqi troop level in Kuwait
remained unchanged.
   Meanwhile, Bush administration officials said they expect
to complete by this weekend an analysis of the economic needs
of Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, which have suffered substantial
economic harm as a result of the embargo.
   The U.S. and its allies want to use aid to prod Jordanian
King Hussein away from his support of Saddam Hussein.
Japanese government officials say Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama met with King Hussein for half an hour during a
Mideast tour and said Japan was willing to extend aid,
provided Jordan abides by the United Nations resolution
blocking trade with Iraq.
   A U.S. official commented: "You can't give anybody help
from the effects of the embargo if they aren't honoring the
embargo."
   In the cases of Egypt and Turkey, the administration hopes
that aid will minimize domestic discontent, thus ensuring
that the coalition against the Iraqi dictator will hold
together.
   President Bush personally has asked Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu to help some troubled Mideast
countries, according to Japanese government officials. And a
senior U.S. official said he expected the U.S. to begin
discussions next week with other possible donor nations,
including West Germany, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates. Some of these nations already have
promised or have begun providing assistance to Jordan and
Egypt.
   "We're talking about coordinating a multilateral effort,"
the senior U.S. official said. He added that this effort
didn't yet "have a price tag."
   According to preliminary estimates, that price tag could
be substantial. A day after Jordan's King Hussein left the
U.S. last week, his finance minister, Basil Jardanah, gave
the Bush administration a seven-page paper stating that
Jordan's losses from the Gulf crisis could be as high as $2
billion over the next year, or about half its annual economic
output.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in Cairo earlier
this week that his nation was likely to lose at least $2
billion on an annual basis as a result of the disruptions
caused by the Gulf crisis. And a spokeswoman at the Turkish
Embassy here estimated that Turkey's losses would be at least
$2.5 billion.
   Some of the major prospective losses listed by Jordan,
according to Jordanians and others familiar with the document
given to Treasury and State Department officials, include:
$200 million in exports, mostly food, to Iraq; $200 million
in fees for goods passing through Jordan; and over $300
million in remittances from Jordanians living in Kuwait.
Jordan also expects to lose about $190 million that it
receives annually in direct aid from Iraq and Kuwait, and it
expects that Iraq will discontinue about $295 million in debt
repayments.
   Jordan submitted a similar document to the U.N. Security
Council.
   Although U.S. officials are deeply upset with King
Hussein, they recognize that he is in dire straits. About 60%
of his population consists of Palestinians, most of whom are
wildly enthusiastic about Saddam Hussein. Jordan's economy is
weak, and Jordanian officials estimate that even if the
country is compensated for its losses, the return of over
100,000 workers and their families from Kuwait could double
Jordan's unemployment rate, currently somewhere between 15%
and 20%.
   According to an Egyptian official, Cairo's immediate
problems are providing transport home for many of its 1.2
million citizens who are fleeing from Iraq and Kuwait, and
absorbing them into its sluggish economy. Many Egyptians who
fled now are penniless in Jordan.
   Many of the Egyptians in Kuwait held high-paying
professional jobs and sent home an estimated $3 billion
yearly, according to an Egyptian official here. The offical
told of a personal friend who spent 22 years in Kuwait and
accumulated considerable savings but was unable to take
anything with him when he left for Jordan.
   The European Community announced yesterday that it
approved spending $1.3 million to help fly refugees out of
Jordan, according to Reuters. And a spokesman at the West
German embassy in Washington said his nation was sending a
relief airplane to Jordan.
