   MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines, in another attempt to lure
business travelers, launched a frequent-flier promotion
designed to award free tickets more quickly than competitors'
programs.
   Under "Business Break," Eastern passengers will receive
two free round-trip tickets to Honolulu, Cancun, St. Thomas
or St. Croix after seven non-excursion round trips on
Eastern. Other airlines' programs generally require more
travel before awarding free tickets.

   Eastern, which is being operated by a trustee appointed by
the federal Bankruptcy Court, also said it will schedule
special flights exclusively for "Business Break" award
recipients and that bonus travel will be available between
Dec. 14 and April 14, generally a peak period for those
Hawaiian, Mexican and Caribbean destinations. A spokeswoman
said the chartered planes will make it possible for Eastern
to fly to Honolulu, the most popular destination for frequent
fliers, even though the airline doesn't offer scheduled
service to that city.
   Eastern entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection last
year after a strike grounded nearly all its flights and has
been trying to rebuild its operations.
