   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said it will call up as many as
49,700 reserve troops over the next five weeks and post most
of them in Saudi Arabia.
   The first call-ups are expected as early as today, a
Defense Department spokesman said, with a maximum of 9,800 by
Aug. 31. As many as 39,900 more will be called by Oct. 1. The
Pentagon didn't name any of the units that would be called.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved the services'
requests for reserve call-ups and also authorized them to
require active-duty soldiers, sailors and airmen already in
the Middle East to delay plans to retire or quit. The
Pentagon announcement set the upper limit on the call-up
through Oct. 1, but not all of the reservists authorized are
expected to be called. The Marines, for instance, won
approval to call up about 3,000 troops, but are expected to
actually call only a small fraction of that number.
   Those called to active duty will serve 90-day tours, which
may be extended by another 90 days.
   The Pentagon said that most of the 24,734 Army reservists
that may be called would be sent to Saudi Arabia and assigned
to such tasks as handling food, fuel and ammunition. The
Navy, which can call 6,243 reservists -- about half of whom
would go to Saudi Arabia -- is looking for dock handlers and
medical personnel. The Air Force, which can call 14,476
reservists, needs air-transport crews. The Coast Guard can
call as many as 1,250.
