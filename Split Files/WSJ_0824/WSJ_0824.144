   HUDSON, Ohio -- Alltel Corp., a local telephone service
provider, said it will purchase as many as four million, or
5%, of its common shares outstanding in open-market
transactions from time to time.
   The company said the program is a response to
"unprecedented declines in the prices of telecommunications
stocks."
