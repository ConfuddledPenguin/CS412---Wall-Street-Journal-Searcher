   PITTSBURGH -- An investor group opposed to H.H. Robertson
Co.'s pending merger with Ceco Industries Inc. said it may
seek to defeat the transaction, perhaps through a proxy
challenge or bid for the entire company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, HHR Acquisition Corp., headed by New York investor
Douglas A. Kass, confirmed that it has increased its stake in
Robertson to 18.2%, or more than 1.1 million shares. That
includes an additional 115,500 shares bought between July 12
and Aug. 22 for $9.18 to $11 each.

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Robertson common closed at $8.50, down 75 cents. Robertson
makes steel roofs and related construction materials; Ceco,
of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., makes wood and steel doors.
   Mr. Kass said the group's intentions haven't changed
despite the recent death of his partner, Anthony Pedone. In
its filing, the group said it would seek a shareholder list
from Robertson for a possible proxy solicitation to oppose
management in its merger with Ceco. The group also said it
may seek "a possible change of control of Robertson."
   Under the terms of the merger, announced in May, Robertson
would acquire Ceco, with Ceco in turn ultimately owning about
25% of the merged company.
   In a related move, Frontera S.A., a Swiss investment
company, has agreed to invest $40 million to help fund the
cash portion of the buy-out. In return, Frontera would
receive about four million shares, or about 28% of the merged
company.
   A Robertson spokesman said he hadn't yet seen the SEC
filing and couldn't comment.
