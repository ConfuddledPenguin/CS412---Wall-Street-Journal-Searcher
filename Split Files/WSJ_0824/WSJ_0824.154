   Tokyo stocks plummeted 5.8% Thursday, registering the
fourth largest one-day point drop in the market's history.
   London shares ended lower but managed to finish above the
day's low after Wall Street made a slight recovery from steep
losses in its first hour of trading.

   The slide in Tokyo, which accelerated after Wednesday's 4%
plunge, had traders wondering how low the market can go.
"People are panicking," says Craig Chudler, strategist at
UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew Securities Ltd. "We're looking at a
meltdown scenario." From the moment trading began Thursday
morning, the Nikkei Index continued its tailspin, falling
more than 1000 points in the first two hours. The Nikkei
finished the day at 23737.63, down 1473.28 points. An
estimated 450 million shares changed hands, up slightly from
397.7 million Wednesday.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rebounded 348.12 points
to close the morning session at 24085.75.
   In Thursday's trading, decliners towered over advancers
927-14, while 18 issues were unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price
Index of all issues listed in the first section dropped
110.58 points, or 5.7%, to 1829.25.
   The Second Section Index took a 204.17-point nosedive, or
5.3%, to 3634.15. Volume was estimated at 7.7 million shares,
down from 9.2 million Wednesday.
   Analysts said the plunge in stock prices reflected the
dismal performance of the Tokyo bond market. The benchmark
No. 119 issue of 10-year Japanese government bonds fell 0.82
to 82.14, for a yield of 8.305%, a 0.195 percentage point
gain. It is the highest government bond yield in a decade.
   The bond market, in turn, was battered by the Japanese
government's decision to go ahead with an 800 billion yen
($5.48 billion) bond sale Wednesday despite the market's
jitters. Analysts had been warning for days that if Japan's
Ministry of Finance pushed ahead with the auction few
investors would respond. The dire predictions proved accurate
from the moment selling began; the auction drew little better
than half the number of bidders who participated in a similar
sale in July.
   "It's clear that the Ministry of Finance doesn't give a
damn about the stock market," one U.S. analyst said of the
decision to proceed with the bond sale.
   The sluggish bond market aggravated investors' already
acute fears about rising interest rates and escalating
tensions in the Persian Gulf, according to analysts. "As long
as we continue to face serious uncertainties in the Middle
East, conditions for a long-term depressed atmosphere will
prevail," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist at Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   But Thursday's fall also may have been the product of
panic selling by individual investors trading on margin. The
poor performance of usually stable issues such as Sony,
Nintendo and Nippon Steel -- bluechip stocks that are the
favorites of small investors -- lend credence to that
interpretation. Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone, another
favorite among individual investors, closed at a record low
of 851,000 yen a share, down a whopping 99,000.
   After the market slid in March, regulatory authorities at
the Tokyo Stock Exchange reduced the margin requirement for
investors to 40% of their equity holdings. That change buoyed
the market for a time because it enabled individuals to buy
more stocks on borrowed money. But now many of those
investors find themselves in the lurch as the value of their
portfolio spirals downward, prompting banks and securities
houses to call in loans.
   Exchange officials "played a dangerous game earlier by
easing margin requirements," says Mr. Chudler of
UBS-Phillips. "In effect, they transfered shares from strong
investors to weak investors. The big risk was share prices
would decline."
   But some analysts interpreted panic selling by individuals
as a positive sign. The drop in blue-chip stock prices
"indicates that this is a final sale phenomenon," says Akira
Suzuki, an economist at Morgan Stanley Group Inc. Mr. Suzuki
remains bullish on the Tokyo market's long-term prospects
despite its troubles since Iraqi tanks stormed across the
Kuwaiti border Aug. 2.
   A small number of market participants seem to share that
upbeat sentiment. Amid the past week's decline, a few bullish
investors have been snatching up bargains. Officials at Shuwa
Corp., a property-investment concern, Wednesday confirmed
that in recent days the company has boosted its holdings of
Isetan to slightly more than 48 million shares, giving Shuwa
a 21.9% stake in the retailing giant and making it the
chain's largest holder.
   Analysts say Shuwa aims to influence Isetan's decisions
about its prime real estate holdings. Shuwa officials say
they plan to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares of the
retailer by mid-September; Isetan's stock finished the day at
4100, down 190.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share
Index fell 29.8 points to 2075.0. The Financial Times
30-Share Index was down 18.3 points at 1604.2. Volume was
492.6 million shares, up from Wednesday's 338 million.
   Trading was thin as investors stayed away from positions
vulnerable to turns in the Middle East crisis.
   ICI, described by one trader as a benchmark issue, fell 11
pence to 890 pence (21 cents to $17.15) a share.
   Oil giants Shell and British Petroleum were both down:
Shell dropped 12 to 467, and BP fell 5 to 359. However, the
oil sector remains the most resilient in the market, a trader
said.
   Trusthouse-Forte rose 3 to 249. One trader said the shares
were recovering after having reached lows.
   Hanson dropped 4 1/2 to 197 after the British government
said it ended talks with the company about a possible
purchase of PowerGen, an electricity generating concern. The
government decided instead to proceed with its original plan
of selling PowerGen shares to the public.
   Drinks concern Allied-Lyons rose 7 to 449 after an
announcement that Suntory of Japan had raised its stake to
slightly less than 5% from about 3%.
   Meanwhile, shares also fell in all major European and
Asian stock markets and in Johannesburg.
