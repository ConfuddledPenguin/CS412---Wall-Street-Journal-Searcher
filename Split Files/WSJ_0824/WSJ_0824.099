   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. told the United Auto
Workers union that it is willing to increase the benefits of
the workers it lays off, but the company didn't offer to
enhance job security for any of its 280,000 UAW members.
   Both GM and Ford Motor Co. put formal contract offers on
the bargaining table yesterday in their bid to become the
union's "target" company for negotiating a pattern-setting
contract among the Big Three auto makers. Details of the Ford
proposal couldn't be learned. Chrysler Corp. will make its
contract proposal to the union today.

   The UAW is bargaining separately with the three auto
makers for a contract for a total 450,000 UAW members.
   In its proposal to the auto makers, the union has asked
them to keep all their current employees on the job, and pay
them full wages and benefits unless there is a severe threat
to the viability of the company. That proposal is similar to
the practices followed by Japanese auto makers.
   The union is scheduled to select its target company on
Tuesday, and it is widely expected to be GM. The current
three-year contract between the companies and the union
expires Sept. 14.
   Although few details were provided about GM's offer to
boost benefits to laid-off workers, it is known that the
company is willing to increase the amount of money furloughed
workers get, rather than boosting non-dollar benefits. One
current GM program pays laid-off workers up to 95% of their
take-home pay, although that fund is low and benefits have
been reduced.
   GM's proposal included a base-wage increase in the first
year, followed by lump sum-payments at the outset of the two
following years. GM also proposed to improve its pension plan
for UAW retirees.
   Taken together, the moves could help GM reduce its work
force by taking some of the pain out of permanent layoffs it
says are necessary to make it more competitive and by
encouraging some of its older workers to retire once they
become eligible for pensions.
   In return, GM wants UAW officials to approve measures that
would increase productivity in its factories and allow the
company to discharge habitually absent employees.
   The proposal, which GM officials gave to UAW officials in
a closed-door meeting here, marks the first such initial
proposal in which the company offered pay raises to its UAW
employees. Typically, the company doesn't "put money on the
table" until final negotiations began.
   Neither the company nor the union would formally comment
on the details of the proposal. Persons close to the
negotiations, however, did describe the proposal on the
condition of anonymity.
   The pay-increase gambit could sway UAW leaders to select
GM as the target company for negotiations.
   When the UAW chooses one of the Big Three as its target,
it will break off negotiations with the other two auto makers
and press talks with the target company for an accord before
the contract expires.
   "We're serious about going first," a GM executive said,
indicating his company's preference to be the target.
   GM wants to use the talks to get top union leaders to
support their desire for greater flexibility in the plants.
One of GM's chief objectives is to gain support in the UAW
for operating its plants on three shifts. That would allow
the auto maker to boost vehicle output of some models --
assuming demand warranted such a movethereby greatly
increasing a plant's profits.
   The auto maker also wants to stem absenteeism, a serious
problem in GM's factories; it often hovers around 15% of its
hourly work force daily.
   Although GM's wage-increase proposal comes much earlier
than usual, it is structured similar to the current contract.
The pact awarded UAW members a 3% base-wage increase in the
first year, followed by lump-sum payments equal to 3% of
their wages in each of the following two years. GM's current
wage proposal is less than 3%, but it is unlikely that the
final settlement will be identical with the current offer.
   UAW President Owen Bieber attended formal negotiating
sessions with all three auto makers this week. He urged them
to pick up the pace of bargaining and told them that their
offers will play a significant role in determining which
company the union will select as target.
