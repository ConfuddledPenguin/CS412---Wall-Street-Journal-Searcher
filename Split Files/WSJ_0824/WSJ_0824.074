   Twenty-nine years have passed since another power-crazed
Iraqi ruler threatened Kuwait. Abdul Karim Kassem (his regime
was overthrown 18 months later and he was subsequently
executed) had neither the strength nor the courage to launch
an invasion. His army had no battle experience apart from a
disastrous appearance on the borders of the newly created
state of Israel 13 years before. In June 1961 Britain and
Kuwait had signed a new treaty of friendship to replace that
negotiated in 1899 to prevent German encroachment into the
Gulf. Kuwait agreed not to cede territory to any other power
in return for British protection.
   The extent of this territory outside Kuwait City was
vague, except to the north: the Turks regarded the whole
Emirate as merely part of the Vilayet (a Turkish term for a
region or large district with a governor appointed by the
Porte) of Basra. Legend has it that Winston Churchill defined
the southern border by placing a pair of dividers on a map,
one point on Kuwait City, one on the northern border, then
swung equidistant south. Hence perhaps the existence of two
curious "Neutral Zones" between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to
the south and Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to the west.

   Within days of the new treaty being signed, Abdul Karim
Kassem laid claim to Kuwait and the saber-rattling began.
Kuwait called for military support from Britain: The response
was immediate. Land, sea and air forces closed on Kuwait not
only from Cyprus but from bases then held in East Africa and
Aden.
   In fact, the whole operation had been carefully rehearsed
the previous winter -- so it was not altogether surprising
that it went smoothly. I was serving as the (sole) British
contract officer in the Kuwait armed forces, charged with
running their medical services, and watched in awe as British
troops poured in by air and sea to take up positions on
Kuwait's northern frontier -- in temperatures over 120
degrees Fahrenheit. It may have been rehearsed but no one
could have envisaged a "first night" in such heat, compounded
by a deadly "shimaal" -- a north wind bearing sand which
choked men and machines (a lesson learned by the Royal Navy,
whose jet aircraft were immobilized by this wind, even miles
out to sea).
   A Royal Marine commando unit landed early on -- "very
edgy" they were too, in the words of one of their
sergeant-majors. During the next few days the average fluid
intake of each man was 45 pints a day; a regime enforced by
their excellent NCOs, and I did not hear of a single case of
heat illness in the unit. Alas, this record was not
maintained. Cases of heat-stroke occurred, more frequently in
the "back areas," and several deaths ensued.
   On one occasion a visiting British general harangued the
local ground force commander with the need to instill water
discipline amongst the troops. On the North-West Frontier, he
declared, his men had lived on a water bottle a day. "Do as
the Arabs do, eh?" he concluded, turning to the British
ambassador who was also in attendance. "Yes -- and die young
of kidney stones," he responded gloomily.
   The fortitude of the men in the searing heat was amazing.
"They say it's 128 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade -- and I'm
still looking for it." Such remarks were commonplace.
Grousing, of course, helped. There was the heavily laden
marine staggering across the oil and sand runway near Ahmadi
where the first transports landed -- and nearly stayed, their
wheels bogged up to the axles. One of his comrades shouted,
"Got all yer officer's kit, Nobby?" "Yer-everything except
his mackin-f--in'-tosh."
   But under this banter, tempers were stretched thin -- and
what if there had been a shooting match? In some concern for
my own men I asked an Irish soldier . . . whether he would be
able to tell the difference between an Iraqi and a Kuwaiti.
"Probably not," came the flat reply, "but then I don't think
it would make a great deal of difference."
   The days passed, the wind died, and with it the tension.
Stalemate. The Iraqis never pushed their luck and the silly
season started. Fifty more staff officers arrived in the
Brigade HQ mess on some pretext or another. On one occasion a
REME colonel asked for a lift to an abandoned oil company
camp near the frontier to repair a fuse box. We "militarized"
a civil hospital for sick British servicemen when my small
military hospital overflowed. The commander of the Kuwait
army, Major-General Mubarak Abdulla Jabir Al Sabah,
Sandhurst-trained inevitably, announced he would visit them
and distribute gifts. As we walked through the wards and he
addressed man after man I became increasingly desperate as
each one responded to his polite enquiry with the same answer
-- "Piles, sir]" It was a relief to find a lance-corporal who
had shut his finger in a car door.
   Life in the desert had settled into a routine. As I had
the transport which the British army lacked, Kuwaiti medical
teams joined British units. With the Parachute Brigade field
ambulance at Jahra, 30 miles north of Kuwait City, we were
especially popular as we had air-conditioned ambulances and a
piper.
   But conditions were telling on troops in the open desert.
Near the frontier the armored screen provided by the 11th
Hussars had been in position for more than two months. One
evening I watched them playing football. They stumbled, fell,
miskicked, oblivious of their performance. They were
exhausted but unaware of it. It was fortunate they were not
called upon to fight at that stage.
   The Arab League force finally arrived. . . . They were
Saudi Arabian, Egyptian and Sudanese troops in the main,
commanded by a Saudi lieutenant-general. He was forbidden to
communicate with the British -- this included me -- so when
he became ill the consultation took place through an
interpreter and a bed-screen. The Kuwaitis managed the
handover from one ally to another smoothly and gave the
British a rousing send-off.
   It had been a remarkable expression of Anglo-Kuwaiti
friendship considering it was just five years since the Suez
debacle -- "Suez in reverse" was how Nasser termed it. Will
the outcome of this year's onslaught end as satisfactorily?
It is to be fervently hoped so, but this time there will be
no British troops digging in on the Mutla ridge.
