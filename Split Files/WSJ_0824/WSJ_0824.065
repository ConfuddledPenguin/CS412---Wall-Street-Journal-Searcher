   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it is
investigating allegations that a Kansas City, Mo.,
aircraft-parts broker sold faulty and unsafe parts to
commercial airlines.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said it has alerted
customers of the company, K.C. Aerospace, but federal
officials declined to identify airlines that have bought
parts from the broker.

   A spokesman for Pan American World Airways said the
airline has bought avionics equipment from the company but
that the equipment had been checked and cleared before being
used. The airline said that it has stopped doing business
with the company until the matter is resolved.
   A spokesman for USAir Inc. said the airline had bought two
pieces of communications equipment from K.C. Aerospace but
that they were in storage and would be examined by engineers
before being used. He also said the airline had bought some
auxiliary power-unit bearings from the company but was
confident, based on records, that they were safe.
   Northwest Airlines said it purchased used parts from K.C.
Aerospace, but tested them before using them. The carrier
said it was checking to determine whether it also had
purchased new parts and whether those parts were tested
before use.
   A spokesman for United Airlines said the airline had
purchased one part from the company this year and four parts
last year, two of which were rejected and returned to K.C.
Aerospace. American Airlines hasn't purchased parts from K.C.
Aerospace in the past two years, a spokesman for the carrier
said.
   Continental Airlines is also a customer, according to a
lawyer for K.C. Aerospace, but officials with that carrier
couldn't be reached for comment.
   K.C. Aerospace, which has about 40 employees, sells both
new and used electronic equipment for aircraft. It also
operates an aircraft-parts repair service. The company denied
any wrongdoing and said it was continuing to operate.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, explaining why he had
taken the unusual step of announcing the investigation while
no charges have been brought, said that airline passengers
could be at risk. "We must be constantly alert to allegations
that involve tampering with the safety of the public," he
said in a prepared statement. The department has not alleged
that any parts from the company have resulted in any deaths
or injuries.
   The K.C. Aerospace lawyer, Richard Helfand, said, "We have
no idea what {the government is} looking for, and they aren't
telling us." He added that the company had given federal
agents "whatever records they asked for" during a
court-authorized search on Aug. 15. The Justice Department
refused to disclose the source of the allegations against the
small, closely held company.
   The government believes that K.C. Aerospace may have
"misrepresented the condition and source of parts supplied to
its commercial customers, which include airlines," the
Justice Department said in its statement. The FAA is trying
to assist airlines in identifying those parts that possibly
should be removed from their inventories or replaced on
aircraft.
   The FAA will scrutinize, for example, whether the K.C.
Aerospace falsely stated that used parts were new, according
to Robert Buckhorn, a spokesman for the agency. The FAA has
told airlines, other airplane operators and aviation vendors
that all parts bought from K.C. Aerospace "should be verified
by independent means" as to their source and condition.
   In a related but separate investigation, the FAA is
considering whether to revoke the company's certificate to
operate a repair station. Such stations, which normally
repair broken aircraft parts sent by airlines and other
aircraft operators, are certificated by the FAA. "We're
looking to see whether the work they are doing is meeting our
specifications," said Mr. Buckhorn.
