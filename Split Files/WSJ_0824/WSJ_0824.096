   CYPRESS, Calif. -- PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. said
that closely held UniHealth America may buy as many as
500,000 additional shares of its stock, boosting its stake in
PacifiCare to 62% from 58%.
   UniHealth said that its ownership of PacifiCare common
stock could be greater, given that PacifiCare this month said
it may purchase on the open market as many as 500,000 shares,
or 4%, of its 11.5 million common shares outstanding.

   Eric Benveniste, chief financial officer of Burbank,
Calif.-based UniHealth, said the company may buy additional
PacifiCare stock because "we view this stock to be a very
sound investment."
   PacifiCare owns and operates health maintenance
organizations.
