   Iraq isn't the only Asian nation with nuclear ambitions
and an unhealthy interest in its neighbors' real estate. Just
to the north and east of the Persian Gulf, Indian and
Pakistani forces are sniping at each other across the border
of Kashmir. The two countries have fought three wars since
1947: It looks disturbingly as if they are preparing for a
fourth.
   Last week, Pakistan accused India of attacking a military
stronghold on its side of the mountains; this week, India
announced that Pakistani artillery had bombarded Indian
installations. For the moment, India and Pakistan are
quarreling over who shoved whom first. But the real issue is
control of the Indian province of Jammu &amp; Kashmir -- the
issue that sparked the second Indo-Pak War in 1965.

   The largely Moslem people of Indian Kashmir are rebelling
violently against the authorities in New Delhi. They complain
that they were taken into India against their will in 1947
and that New Delhi has systematically rigged elections in the
province to keep nationalists out of power. The Indian
military is suppressing the rebellion in its usually bloody
and incompetent way. Hundreds have been killed. Pakistan,
which occupies a chunk of Kashmir itself, is, if not arming
the rebels, at least turning a blind eye to arms smuggling.
   It's exactly the same pattern as in the rich Indian
province of Punjab. There too New Delhi goaded a religious
minority, this time the Sikhs, into political extremism. The
Sikh extremists committed horrible atrocities. The Indian
government reacted even more atrociously. An ensuing
anti-Sikh pogrom in New Delhi claimed 3,000 lives. All the
while, guns poured in over the Pakistani border.
   The U.S. has usually watched Indo-Pak relations with
dismay. To its credit, India conducts itself as a huge, if
turbulent and imperfect, democracy. Pakistan has been a good
friend of the U.S. and a bulwark against the Soviet thrust
into Afghanistan.
   Pakistan's popularly elected Bhutto government has now
been removed under a torrent of corruption and mismanagement
charges. For all her faults, Ms. Bhutto was genuinely
uninterested in war with India. It's not clear that her
successors will feel the same way -- especially not after a
few more months of watching Indian troops maltreat their
co-religionists. Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh, meanwhile,
knows that if he lets Kashmir go, his whole country -- a
seething mass of ethnic, religious, regional, clan and caste
hatreds -- could unravel.
   All of this would be a dreadful but largely local story if
India had not started an arms race on the subcontinent. It
exploded a nuclear bomb in 1974; Pakistan has been
frantically trying to catch up for 15 years. India has built
a blue ocean navy, including two aircraft carriers and a
Soviet-built nuclear submarine, that is making countries as
far away as Australia nervous.
   If India and Pakistan want to run wasteful, socialist
economies, that's their business. If they can't preserve
peace among their component minority groups, that's also
their business. But if they begin to threaten not only each
other but the rest of their region with conventional
firepower or, ultimately, nuclear intimidation, then they
will attract the world's interest. Like Iraq, they serve as a
reminder that the world is still an unsettled place, where
bellicose nations threaten to hurl their increasingly large
and powerful armies at one another's throats.
