   In "Dynasty Undone" on the family feud affecting U-Haul
(page one, July 16), I am quoted as saying, in reference to
Joe and Mark Shoen, "Their desire for absolute power is
insatiable. The more they have, the more they want." These
are accurate quotes from a confidential psychological report
that I submitted to their father and then-chairman of the
board, L.S. Shoen, 11 years ago. My concern is that the
public will believe that I authorized the release of these
quotes and therefore lose confidence in the professional
psychologist's commitment to the principle of
confidentiality. I did not authorize, nor did I know
beforehand, that these statements would be released. When I
completed my 10 months of work with the Shoen family, I wrote
and gave to the principal officer of U-Haul my assessment of
the working members of the family. It was clearly marked
confidential, but once a report leaves my hands I no longer
own nor control it. I am firmly committed to the principle of
confidentiality as stated by the American Psychological
Association and the Arizona Board of Psychological Examiners.
