   Investors bid up Paramount Communications Inc. shares this
week, amid reports that Chris-Craft Industries Inc. Chairman
Herbert Siegel is buying the stock and that a takeover may
follow. Paramount shares surged $2.75 on Wednesday to close
at $36.625.
   But if recent events are any indication, those investors
are taking a mighty big risk.

   After a modest flurry of activity last month, takeovers
have slowed to a near-standstill since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. Economic uncertainty generated by skyrocketing oil
prices has given corporate acquirers new reason to pause --
on top of already tight credit conditions imposed by wary
banks and the high-yield, high-risk "junk" bond market.
   Investors who have bet on takeovers have been disappointed
time and again this year. Even arbitragers who trade takeover
stocks for a living have taken a pounding, particularly this
month, on all manner of deals rumored, announced and even
completed.
   Some advocates of takeover investing have retreated from
the fray. "I'd say the average investor is probably better
off to sit on the sidelines," said Michael Lamb, president of
Wealth Monitors Inc., which used to recommend that investors
follow corporate raiders into takeover stocks.
   The oil-price spike has all but snuffed out chances for a
$201-a-share, or $4.38 billion, buy-out of United Airlines
parent UAL Corp. That deal's latest collapse has sent UAL
shares tumbling from $161 to a closing price yesterday of
$93, down $7.
   This decline has inflicted a paper loss of $171 million on
UAL's biggest holder, Coniston Partners, which paid an
average disclosed price of $161 a share for its 2.5 million
shares. Coniston's general partner, Paul Tierney Jr., said
yesterday, "We still have our entire position and will do
everything in our power to effect a positive resolution." But
he wouldn't comment on the stock price.
   The marketwide downturn has left other would-be takeover
catalysts nursing big losses, from the Texas billionaire
Harold Simmons in Lockheed Corp. to a group led by David
Batchelder, formerly chief takeover strategist for T. Boone
Pickens Jr., in Pic 'N' Save Corp.
   Michael Steinhardt, a hedge-fund manager, placed a bet on
a takeover of USAir Group Inc. during the heady days a year
ago when the Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis was pursuing
UAL and the real estate developer and casino owner Donald
Trump was bidding for American Air Lines parent AMR Corp.
Average cost of Mr. Steinhardt's 3.7 million USAir shares:
$45. Yesterday's closing price of USAir stock: $14.25. "If I
live long enough, it'll come out," Mr. Steinhardt chuckled
ruefully.
   Asked about his $199 million paper loss on his 19% stake
in Lockheed, Mr. Simmons replied: "I don't look at it as a
loss. I didn't buy for resale but for a long-term acquisition
of the company." He said he hasn't decided on another proxy
fight against Lockheed management next year, after having
fallen short this year.
   Takeover plays based on supposed calculations of "asset
values" have become particularly treacherous. Some analysts
have been recommending Boise Cascade Corp. based on an "asset
value" of $80 a share or more. Wall Street people say the New
Jersey investor David Bolger acquired 4% of the paper company
and tried to drum up takeover interest. Mr. Bolger wouldn't
comment.
   On Aug. 3, the specialist who trades Boise Cascade stock
was mobbed with buyers on rumors of an imminent bid. That
day, Boise stock surged $4.875 to $36.375, despite a steep
marketwide decline. But since then, no bids have
materialized, and Boise Cascade has slumped back to a closing
price yesterday of $26.50.
   Traders have even managed to lose money on deals that have
been completed. After Forstmann, Little &amp; Co., the leveraged
buy-out firm, announced a $44.50-a-share buy-out of General
Instrument Corp. on July 2, the stock surged to $46.875 on
speculation of a higher bid.
   It is tough to make money buying at $46.875 and selling at
$44.50. But the stock didn't fall below the bid price until
July 26. Nonetheless, "Almost everybody lost money on General
Instrument," a takeover stock trader said yesterday.
   Some takeover stocks have collapsed after deals were
announced, such as American General Corp., which put itself
up for sale following a proxy challenge by Torchmark Corp.
With the sale process proceeding at a snail's pace, the
insurer's stock has slumped from $50.375 to yesterday's close
of $38.50.
   As for Paramount, people aren't holding their breath for a
bid from Chris-Craft's Mr. Siegel. For one thing, he and
Paramount Chairman Martin Davis are close friends. They could
always team up on a friendly bid, because Paramount's shares
have declined from their 1989 peak of $66.50. But financing
could be iffy. Some traders bet Mr. Siegel would be willing
to wait years for something to happen, without acting as a
catalyst himself.
   Yesterday, Paramount shares gave back most of Wednesday's
gains in a marketwide decline, falling $2 a share to $34.625.
   Before the Mideast crisis began, some analysts argued that
investors could speculate on takeovers by buying stocks of
companies in industries where consolidation is predicted,
such as telecommunications, utilities and health care.
   But the Mideast situation has forced every potential buyer
to recalculate assumptions about interest rates, oil prices,
recession and inflation -- the underpinnings of any
calculation of what a business is worth.
   "Given the magnitude of uncertainty today, buyers and
sellers are asking themselves what is the right price for
transactions in almost every industry," Jack Levy, co-head of
mergers at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said.
   "People are certainly more sensitive to the relative
probability of a recession," Robert Cotter, co-head of
mergers at First Boston Corp., said. If nothing else, he
believes the Mideast crisis will scuttle any revival of the
junk-bond market, keeping financing out of reach for many
acquirers.
   "On the other hand," Mr. Cotter said, "if the Mideast
crisis sends the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to 2100,
some companies are going to look pretty cheap." And he said
he believes a "strategic rationale" remains for mergers in
telecommunications, utilities and health care.
   In July alone, GTE Corp. agreed to acquire Contel Corp.
for $6.29 billion, and International Business Machines Corp.
agreed to sell some low-tech businesses for about $2.5
billion.
   But even such strategic acquisitions can scorch investors.
When Pacific Telesis Group agreed to a merger of mobile-phone
operations with Cellular Communications Inc., Cellular's
stock tumbled $2.25 a share on the news, because the deal was
structured to include a series of options and contingencies.
