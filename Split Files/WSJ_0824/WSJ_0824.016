   TWINSBURG, Ohio -- Revco D.S. Inc. said it reached an
agreement to sell 146 stores in the Southwest, completing its
plan to divest itself of 712 stores in 17 states.
   The retail drugstores, in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and
Colorado, were sold to RDS Acquisition Corp. for an
undisclosed amount. The company said RDS also agreed to lease
the Revco distribution center in Glendale, Ariz.

   The sales must be approved by the bankruptcy court in
Akron, Ohio. Revco has been under bankruptcy-law protection
from creditors since July 28, 1988.
