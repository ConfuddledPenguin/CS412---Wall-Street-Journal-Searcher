   Pontiac, Mich. -- Enter the offices of the Detroit Lions
football team here and you'll see photo blowups of the Lions
of old, growling in the snow and mud of a Detroit winter.
You'll recall that this gang last tasted serious glory when
the likes of Alex Karras, Joe Schmidt and "Night Train" Lane
prowled its defensive side, and its offense served mainly to
give those beasts a rest.
   Today's Lions are a quite-different breed. They play not
in gritty Motown but in this distant suburb, and beneath a
mudfree, snow-proof, silver-toned dome. The team's defense in
recent years has been perfunctory at best. It's current
selling point is an attack it calls the "Silver Stretch," but
that most others call the "run-and-shoot." By either name,
it's the latest in National Football League slick.

   Interestingly, though, the spiffy new suit seems to suit,
and the pride has regained its, uh, pride. "One of our jobs
going into this season will be to guard against
over-optimism," says Wayne Fontes, the Lions' second-year
head coach. "People's expectations for us are pretty high
after last year."
   What the Lions did to get the locals revved up was to win
six of their last seven games. Trouble was, they'd lost eight
of nine by that time, so their final mark was an
undistinguished 7-9. Still, that was better than the 4-12,
4-11 and 5-11 records of the previous three campaigns, and
not bad for a team that has posted just six .500-plus years
since the 1966 NFL-American Football League merger.
   In that same span, Detroit has won but one divisional
title and gained three playoff berths. It's among four teams
that never have advanced as far as the semifinal (conference
championship) round of the league's Super Bowl tournament.
   Into this Slough of Despond stepped Fontes, a former
defensive assistant. Among his first coachly acts was to
recruit Darrel "Mouse" Davis. Davis had been a sort of Johnny
Appleseed of the run-and-shoot, introducing it around this
country and the one up north in his past posts.
   "Defensive players have become so fast and good that a new
offensive philosophy is required," says the
not-especially-mouselike Mouse. "To move the ball
consistently, you need a way to spread 'em out."
   The run-and-shoot does that by deploying four wide
receivers -- mostly short, quick guys -- and no tight end.
Two of them line up on the line of scrimmage, well outside
the tackles. The other two are "slotted" in the backfield,
outside the tackles but inside the wideouts; one often goes
in motion before the ball is snapped. There's also one
running back, who can double as a pass catcher.
   Davis is quick to point out that it's not so much the
formation that makes the R&amp;S work, but what the quarterback
and receivers do. "We have relatively few plays, but each has
lots of options. The receivers have to react to what the
defenders do, and the quarterback has to read their reactions
and make the right throwing choice."
   He asserts: "If we operate it properly, there isn't
anything we can't do. We can pass long or short, or run the
ball. And we can play from behind or ahead."
   In last year's R&amp;S inaugural at Pontiac, the Lions offense
moved up to 18th-best in the league from 28th, or last, the
season before. They ran better than they shot, which Davis
says was partly attributable to foes spreading their defenses
to stop the pass.
   It also was because of rookie Barry Sanders. This stocky,
fast-starter from Oklahoma State, the 1988 Heisman winner,
led the NFC in rushing with a team-record 1,470 yards. "If
you could build a back to run from the Silver Stretch, you'd
build Barry," Davis notes.
   The Lions' primary shootists last season were Rodney Peete
and Bob Gagliano. Peete, out of Southern Cal, was the
higher-touted of the two but suffered various leg injuries,
and it was under Gagliano, a skinny-looking journeyman, that
the team won its last five games. The pair has traded off at
the starting spot in the current preseason, but Peete, now
healed and bulked up, appears to have the edge.
   Detroit expended its top 1990 draft choice for last
season's Heisman winner, Andre Ware, another quarterback.
Ware dazzled 'em commanding the R&amp;S at the U. of Houston, but
while the Lions have given him a number (11), he hasn't given
them the right one yet, and as of yesterday remained unsigned
and not in camp. This is not uncommon for top draft picks in
a league in which players typically make big bucks early or
not at all (Sanders held out until a few days before his
rookie campaign started), but it still pains Davis.
   "Making our offense go requires the quarterback getting
lots of repetitions," he laments. "Andre's missed too many
already."
   Nonetheless, the other players are getting their reps, and
the coaches think that'll help. So, too, they believe, will
be a receiver corps strengthened by the addition of veteran
free agents Aubrey Matthews (ex-Green Bay) and Terry Greer
(San Francisco), and, maybe, rookie Jeff Campbell.
   The Lions defense could use some firming, and Fontes sees
this taking place. Linebacker Chris Spielman, defensive back
Bennie Blades and lineman Jerry Ball, a contract holdout, are
nasty young veterans, and the team spent its Nos. 2, 3 and 4
draft choices to get them help that's similarly disposed.
   And Fontes, who'd been an assistant coach with the team
before getting the top job with five games left in the 1988
schedule, hopes last season's late success, coupled with two
wins in as many exhibition games this month, will lighten the
burden of the Lions unhappy history.
   "We used to go into games wondering how we'd lose, but
after we beat Cleveland last Thanksgiving we discovered
things didn't have to turn out that way," says he. "Maybe
this season the education process won't be so painful."
