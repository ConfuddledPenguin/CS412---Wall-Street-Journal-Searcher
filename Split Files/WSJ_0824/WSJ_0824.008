   Ironclad Theory?

   I play with scratch golfers and hackers,
   For both bring rewards quite substantial;
   With the former, they're mainly technical --
   With the latter, most often financial.

   Simply Speaking
                                                                                                       

   No second language do I speak,
   But I don't really miss one.
   Why should I learn another tongue?
   I ain't too good with this one.
   -- Dick Emmons.
