   Yasser Arafat carries a revolver to show his commitment to
armed struggle. Every once and a while he pulls out the gun
and shoots himself in the foot.
   As the disastrous consequences of Mr. Arafat's support for
Iraq's conquest of Kuwait became clear, Palestinians and PLO
officials are having a major debate. Jawad al-Ghusayn who, as
chairman of the Palestine National Fund is seeing Saudi and
Kuwaiti contributions vanish, called Iraq's occupation
"illegal" and claims the PLO has always backed Kuwait.
Similarly, Palestinian super-hardliners based in Syria are
supporting Damascus's anti-Iraq position.

   After four days of hot crisis meetings, the PLO came up
with a new and confusing position Sunday. The PLO proposed an
"Arab solution" to the crisis and that any foreign military
forces in the region be put under a UN flag.
   Gulf Arabs are not impressed with this "neutral" stance. A
Saudi diplomat asked how the PLO could do nothing when "a
giant is murdering a little child." Exiled Kuwaitis asked Mr.
Arafat in an open letter, "don't you remember how many years
you spent in Kuwait and the continuous Kuwaiti contributions
and support to the Palestinian revolution?"
   Already having their own states, non-Palestinian Arabs
fear the precedent Iraq is setting by grabbing Kuwait. Cheers
for Baghdad have come almost exclusively from Palestinians,
who also furnish much of the pro-Iraq, anti-American
atmosphere that CBS news cameras recorded in Jordan.
   How did the PLO get into this bog? Last spring Mr. Arafat
made a strategic decision to switch patrons, from Egypt to
Iraq. He resented Cairo's nagging to moderate the PLO and
make a peace with Israel. A PLO leaflet issued the day before
Iraq's invasion called Egypt an American "puppet" and "an
obedient tool in the hands of the American administration."
   Mr. Arafat apparently saw Saddam Hussein as the region's
new strongman. At the Baghdad Arab summit last May he said,
"we declare our support for Iraq," whose missiles and
chemical weapons provided the Arabs with the strategic parity
"to achieve liberation from Baghdad to Jerusalem and from
al-Faw {the southern tip of Iraq} to Gaza."
   When the Iraq-sponsored Palestine Liberation Front (PLF)
launched a terrorist assault on Israel's beaches that same
month, Mr. Arafat defied American blandishments and refused
to renounce the attack: He preferred losing the U.S.-PLO
dialogue to criticizing the PLF and angering his new patron
in Baghdad. Now PLF leader Muhammad Abu al-Abbas calls for
terrorist attacks on American targets to help Iraq: "Strike
with your long arms at all U.S. interests. Open fire at the
enemies of our nation everywhere."
   Palestinians, frustrated at the inability of the
"intifada" to make political gains, are now seeking an
outside liberator. Yet their experience in the 1950s and '60s
with Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, a far more popular and
charismatic figure than Saddam Hussein, gained them nothing.
As an Arab writer put it, "God save this nation from its
heroes]"
   Palestinians' adulation for Saddam also reveals a
widespread feeling among them that Mr. Arafat has failed. A
West Bank Palestinian referred to Iraq's leader as "the Arab
Bismarck." Bismarck unified the German states into one
empire: If Palestine is to be a province in an Iraq-dominated
Middle East, then the separate Palestinian nationalism
represented by the PLO has no place.
   In today's Arab world, only the Palestinians' collective
interest calls for Pan-Arabism. The other Arab countries are
increasingly preoccupied with their own state's needs. Saddam
seized Kuwait's loot for Iraq's benefit, Saudi Arabia called
in U.S. help to protect its independence, Egypt and Syria
acted in their own national interests to oppose Baghdad's bid
for regional domination. As Arab states seek their own
advantage more and more frankly, and pay less and less homage
to Pan-Arabism, the PLO and Palestinian cause can expect to
enjoy less and less aid or diplomatic leverage.
   Iraq's aggression pulls the rug from under the intifada.
Kuwait supported the PLO and West Bank Palestinians through
grants from the Kuwaiti treasury, a Kuwaiti-administered tax
on the 300,000 Palestinians in Kuwait and the private
remittances from Palestinians in Kuwait to relatives on the
West Bank and elsewhere. This link will now be broken.
Kuwait's government-in-exile has cut off its subsidies to the
PLO. Meanwhile, Palestinians are being fired and expelled
from sheikdoms up and down the Gulf because they are feared
as a potential fifth column. On the West Bank, where living
standards have already been cut in half by the uprising, the
loss of the Gulf's assistance will be devastating.
   The harm that Mr. Arafat has done the PLO by backing
Saddam goes beyond the financial. Arab newspapers have noted
that Mr. Arafat, who opposes the seizing of land by force and
the denial of self-determination in the West Bank and Gaza,
seems to favor it in the Gulf. Al-Ahram, Egypt's leading
newspaper, called Mr. Arafat's embrace of Saddam
"prostration" before the man who plunged "his poisoned dagger
in the Arabs' back."
   The discrediting of the Palestinian cause is likely to be
long-lasting. It is not likely that if and when this crisis
ends the Arab states -- who will have just finished begging
the U.S. to save them from Iraq -- will press for concessions
to the PLO, which sided with their enemy. America's principal
Arab allies -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and even Syria --
will hardly feel like doing Arafat a favor.
   Nor will Mr. Arafat gain much from his new alliance, even
if Saddam survives this confrontation. Iraq will be a far
less tolerant patron than Egypt and a far less generous
paymaster than the Gulf states have been. It will press the
PLO, or at least PLO member groups, to step up terrorist
activities on Iraq's behalf, further undermining the PLO's
image. Saddam certainly has no interest in restarting an
Arab-Israel peace process or fostering a U.S.-PLO
rapprochement.
   The PLO is unlikely to split and less likely to disappear.
Ordinary Palestinians, though, will have to decide whether to
blame their continued frustration on Mr. Arafat or the U.S.
Either way, Mr. Arafat's bet on Saddam has destroyed any
immediate prospect for improving their situation.
