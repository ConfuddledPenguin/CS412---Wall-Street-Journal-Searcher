   Comfed Bancorp Inc. said it retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
to assist in the restructuring of its Comfed Savings Bank
unit. The company also said it signed a consent agreement
with the government's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Comfed, Lowell, Mass., said it hired Goldman as part of
its plan to apply for open thrift assistance through the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Goldman will seek new sources
of equity capital through a private investment offering begun
this week.

   The agreement with regulators places certain limitations
on the bank and establishes the government office's authority
to appoint a receiver or conservator if deemed appropriate.
The agreement allows the company to conduct retail banking,
residential mortgage lending and loan servicing, which Comfed
said was "evidence of the regulators' desire to avoid such
conservatorship at this time."
   Comfed, with $1.4 billion in assets, also announced that
it named Jack Zoeller, president and chief executive, to the
added post of chairman. He succeeds Jefferson Allen, who
resigned June 30.
