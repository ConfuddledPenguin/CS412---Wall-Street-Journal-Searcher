   James W. Schmotter (Manager's Journal, editorial page,
July 23) writes that Japanese graduates of American M.B.A.
programs resent the fact that they "use virtually none of the
training they received in the U.S." upon returning home.
Based on my experience in M.B.A. programs, both as a Berkeley
student and a teacher at Golden Gate University, I believe
many U.S. business graduates feel the same way. Rather than
blaming "the companies that sponsored their educations," as
Mr. Schmotter does, one might also re-examine the usefulness
of the current curriculum.
