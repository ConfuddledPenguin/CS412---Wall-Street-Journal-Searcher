   Triton Energy Corp. reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss
of $34.6 million, or $1.77 a share, largely reflecting asset
writedowns. The loss in the quarter ended May 31 included a
gain of $439,000, or two cents a share, from tax-loss
carryforward.
   The Dallas oil and gas exploration concern said it took a
charge of $31.1 million for the write-down of certain assets
in connection with a restructuring plan.

   Vice President Michael P. McInerney said the restructuring
was unrelated to a possible buy-out bid by New Zealand
investor Sir Ronald Brierly, who has accumulated 10.9% of
Triton.
   Fourth-quarter revenue fell 15% to $67.7 million from
$79.8 million in the year-earlier period, when Triton had net
income of $2.2 million, or five cents a share.
   For the year, Triton recorded a net loss of $54.2 million,
or $2.93 a share, on revenue of $260.1 million after
recording a $593,000, or three cent-a-share, extraordinary
gain from tax-loss carry-forward. A year earlier, Triton had
a net loss of $12.5 million, or 87 cents a share, on revenue
of $242.3 million. Those figures included a $534,000, or
three cent-a-share, extraordinary gain from tax-loss
carry-forwards.
