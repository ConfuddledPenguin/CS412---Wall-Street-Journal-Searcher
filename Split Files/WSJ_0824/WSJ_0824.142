   B.F. Goodrich Co. said it would post a third-quarter
after-tax credit of $21.3 million, including a $30.8 million
credit from a tax judgment and a $9.5 million charge from
write-offs.
   The chemical, aerospace, and tire company said it reached
an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service over a 1985
tax deduction for its Convent Chemical Corp. unit, which it
sold in 1985. The deduction was originally disallowed.
