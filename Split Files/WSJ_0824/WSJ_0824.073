   Of all the burning questions confronting President Bush
and Saddam Hussein, the most searing is this: Whose side is
time on?
   How the two leaders answer that may be the crucial factor
in determining whether the current confrontation leads to a
quick war or evolves into a long-term siege. If President
Bush, in particular, decides that time works against him, he
will be far more likely to seek a rationale for striking
quickly against Iraq.

   Yet the question is an agonizing one, for there is no
clear answer. Some powerful American voices are arguing that
a prolonged showdown would clearly benefit Saddam Hussein and
erode the U.S. position. As this argument goes, support will
erode for the international economic blockade of Iraq,
Western hostages will be maneuvered into position as shields
against attack, Saddam Hussein's anti-Western rhetoric will
win converts around the Arab world and America's political
and economic standing will erode.
   "Time is not on our side," declares former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, one of the most forceful advocates of
the view that the U.S. shouldn't allow a prolonged stalemate.
"The United States stands to lose most from a long siege," he
wrote several days ago.
   But in recent days, other voices have emerged, arguing
that time actually works to America's benefit -- and that the
U.S. therefore needn't seek a pretext for a quick military
strike. As this argument goes, the international trade
embargo will rapidly choke off Iraq's one-commodity oil
economy, Iraq's international isolation is growing rather
than easing, the Western military force facing Iraq is
building, and the West won't go wanting for oil so long as
Saudi Arabia and other producers make up for the loss of
Iraqi crude.
   "Every day brings more good news for the U.S. and more bad
news for Iraq," says Barry Rubin, a senior fellow at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "The embargo is
taking hold." He adds: Saddam Hussein "is the one surrounded
and suffering from political isolation and an embargo. He's
very nervous facing an overwhelming force."
   So far the Bush administration has avoided answering the
crucial question, but the Gulf crisis now has evolved to a
point where the president must choose in order to set his
long-term strategy. If he decides time isn't on his side and
wants a pretext for military action, he could get one as
early as today, when the U.S. plans to defy an Iraqi order
that foreign embassies in occupied Kuwait be closed. It seems
likely that Iraq will forcibly remove diplomats who don't
leave voluntarily.
   But privately, administration officials suggest they
aren't looking to use today's embassy-shutdown order as a
pretext for military action -- and that they now are willing
to spend some time looking for a diplomatic solution that
would avoid bloodshed.
   "Time's on everybody's side if it reduces tension and
there can be a diplomatic way out," says Judith Kipper, a
Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. "And in the
last few days, there are a few clumsy signs that {the Iraqis}
are looking for a way to talk."
   Still, some administration officials argue that the only
way the U.S. can lose in the standoff is if it gets locked in
a long stalemate -- an argument that seems to favor looking
for such a pretext to launch quick military action.
   If it allows the situation to drag on, the danger for the
administration lies in the simple fact that the West has a
lousy track record at maintaining concerted international
pressure against anybody. For now, the U.S. has helped
organize a generally tight embargo against Iraq and seems on
the verge of winning some kind of United Nations' approval
for using force to police it. But it's far from clear how
long the U.S. or its allies can stick with it.
   "In a sense, we can afford to wait longer, but public
opinion in this country and in the West generally hasn't been
willing to sustain long embargoes," says Robert Hormats, vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "In a democracy, you
can't keep people enthusiastic for an action as big as this
for very long. They get impatient for results. I'm sure the
White House is aware of that."
   Within the Bush administration, a task force has been set
up under Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson to evaluate
the economic sanctions, and so far administration officials
are pleased with the compliance.
   The sanctions, of course, are designed to deliver a
one-two punch to Iraq, depriving it of oil revenues by
keeping Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude from going out and keeping
arms and food from going in, even if Iraq has money to pay
for them. Iraq is estimated to have on hand a
two-to-three-month supply of food grains -- wheat and rice --
and other commodities. Rationing and belt-tightening could
stretch those stocks for another month or longer, estimates
Andrew Bellingham, an agricultural analyst for World
Perspectives Inc., a Washington-based consulting firm.
   But, paradoxically, the more effective the sanctions, the
more likely some Westerners may be to break them. If reports
of serious deprivation emerge from Iraq, support for the
international embargo could quickly erode. The U.N.
resolution imposing a trade embargo allows food to be shipped
to Iraq for "humanitarian" reasons, and other nations might
quickly start to call for using that loophole. Iraq's
neighbors may also lose their resolve to support the
sanctions if Iraqis are starving.
   Moreover, administration officials acknowledge that the
Iraqi government has the ability to ensure that whatever food
becomes available goes to Saddam Hussein's army, while
civilians starve.
   And Saddam Hussein may even be able to turn a successful
food embargo against the U.S. by making American hostages the
chief victims of food shortages. "That would put the White
House in the position of being seen as starving hostages to
death," says Lester Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute.
"I think that's where the crunch will come."
   Even without such stressful developments, political trends
at home and in the Middle East could work against the Bush
administration. Since the end of the Vietnam War, Congress
has grown antsy about any prolonged military deployment and
is likely to raise more and more questions about the cost of
the American commitment over time.
   Public disenchantment could grow as well, particularly as
more Americans realize that the countries the U.S. is
defending aren't democracies but monarchies run by wealthy
families. And there could even be some friction between the
U.S. and Saudi Arabia over the big American deployment
because "the social environment {of Saudi Arabia} is hardly
the most attractive in the world for wandering GIs," says Mr.
Brown.
   Perhaps more worrisome, it's possible that Saddam Hussein
may be able to steadily build popular support for his defiant
stand around the Arab world. Saddam Hussein is craftily
trying to portray himself not as the invader of Kuwait but as
a kind of Arab Robin Hood, promising to take petrodollars
away from a few wealthy sheiks and restore them to the
impoverished Arab masses. And he is also pledging to use his
occupation of Kuwait as a lever to end Israeli control over
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   "I think that the longer Saddam Hussein can confront the
world, the more I think he'll be the recipient of support in
the Arab street because he shows the other {Arab leaders} to
be impotent -- that somehow right is on his side," says Ms.
Kipper of the Brookings Institution.
   Yet such problems might actually be outweighed by the
advantages the U.S. would have in a prolonged standoff --
advantages such as Iraq's weak and narrow economic base, the
surprising isolation it is feeling, the growing clout of
American military forces in the region and the unattractive
nature of Saddam Hussein's options for breaking out of his
predicament.
   The very strength of Iraq's economy in normal times -- the
luxury to rely on enormous oil payments -- may be the reason
it is easier to squeeze in an embargo than other countries
the West has tried to hurt with economic sanctions. "The
economic aspects in this situation are unique," says a senior
administration official. "Look at Iraq. To oversimplify, it's
oil-out and food-in." And American officials consider
shutting down both oil exports and food imports to be
relatively easy, since both oil and food are big, bulky items
that can't be "tucked away under your shirt as you go through
customs," the official says.
   Retired Admiral Thomas Moorer, former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, also says that time helps the
blockade. "I don't think he can last out a blockade," Adm.
Moorer says. "He has a single product economy."
   There also is reason to believe that, contrary to initial
skepticism, the international coalition against Iraq could
grow stronger over time rather than weaker. Syria now has
forces in the Gulf aligned against fellow Arab Iraq, and
France seems ready to participate not just in sanctions but
in a naval blockade to enforce them. Japan has begun adding
its financial clout to the effort by offering aid to Jordan
if that strategically located neighbor of Iraq will agree to
cut off trade with Baghdad. Even the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which was among the staunchest official
supporters of Iraq in the Arab world, is showing some signs
of waivering.
   Time also may make Iraq's military options less palatable.
The U.S. force in Saudi Arabia is growing rapidly. It still
could take several months, though, to build up enough force
to successfully attack Iraq on land in the conventional
manner. U.S. commanders say they would like to have something
like a two-to-one superiority over Saddam Hussein's 170,000
troops in Kuwait to feel confident about a ground attack.
   But it may be that the military odds shift sharply in
America's favor after a wait of just a few more weeks, not
months. Elmer Pendleton, a retired major general who was the
senior Pentagon officer in Turkey, says that it should take
only a month more for the U.S. to field a force that could
storm Kuwait. With U.S. air superiority, spy satellites and
electronic warfare capabilities, he says, the U.S. could
dislodge Iraq with a force equal to Iraq's 170,000 or so
soldiers.
   It has also been widely speculated that Saddam Hussein
might choose in the short term to ease his plight by drawing
Israel into the fight, thereby switching the confrontation
from one pitting Iraq against the world to one pitting all
Arabs against Israel and its American friends. One way he
might draw Israel into the fight would be by sending troops
into Jordan, a neighbor of Israel, hoping to provoke a
response from Israeli officials who have long said the
presence of Iraqi troops in Jordan is unacceptable to them.
   But that option may be growing less and less attractive as
it becomes clear Israel would hit back with might. One
Israeli diplomat says such a move by Saddam Hussein would be
"suicidal;" Israel would launch an immediate, massive attack.
Even Jordan's army -- man for man probably the best in the
Arab world -- might fight fiercely if Jordan were attacked,
despite Jordan's coziness with Iraq so far in the current
crisis. The army is made up largely of Bedouins fiercely
loyal to Jordan's King Hussein, not Palestinians more drawn
to Iraq's hard-nosed rhetoric.
   And it may be that assumptions about American staying
power and restlessness among American troops stuck on alert
in Saudi Arabia may be wrong. Unlike in Vietnam, when many
soldiers were draftees, the American soldiers now rushed to
the Gulf "are all volunteers, even the reservists," says
Lawrence Korb, a Pentagon aide in the Reagan administration
and now with the Brookings Institution. He concludes: "Time
is on our side."
