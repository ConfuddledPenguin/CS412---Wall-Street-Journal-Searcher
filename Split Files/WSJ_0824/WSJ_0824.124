   Some OPEC oil ministers will meet in Vienna this weekend
to discuss the deteriorating world oil picture.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
confirmed that Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and
OPEC president, invited his fellow ministers to the Austrian
capital to talk about possible responses to the recent loss
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes from world markets.

   "There are going to be consultations among some ministers
Sunday," a spokesman for OPEC said at its Vienna
headquarters, "but we are not calling it a meeting."
   Whatever it's called, the session is likely to be the
closest thing yet to the OPEC "blessing" that some countries
with spare capacity have sought for their pledges to produce
more oil. These countries have been turned down in a request
for an emergency meeting of OPEC to endorse higher output
quotas.
   "This is a very unusual procedure," said a senior OPEC
delegate from one of the countries, "but let's hope it
works."
   Although the promised production increases are slowly
beginning, world oil prices continue to surge. Yesterday,
crude oil jumped by $1.50 to $4 a barrel, pushing more crudes
beyond $30, and fuels rose as much as six cents a gallon.
   In U.S. oil fields, some refiners now are posting prices
as high as $30.75 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark crude. In U.S. futures trading, the October crude
contract rose 71 cents to $31.93 a barrel yesterday, while
unleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 4.44 cents to
nearly $1.09 a gallon.
   Crude oil prices now are more than double their levels as
recently as June. To calm the volatile markets, Venezuela and
Saudi Arabia had been pressing for an emergency OPEC meeting
to act on quotas and production levels.
   That request was rejected Monday. Still, the two countries
have begun to increase output toward a promised total of
about 2.5 million barrels a day, with the bulk of it coming
from Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates could produce an
additional 500,000 barrels a day. This would replace
three-fourths of the four million barrels a day of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crudes removed from world markets as a result of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   It isn't clear whether all 13 member nations will have
representatives at the Vienna talks. Nor is it known whether
anyone will represent Kuwait, which remains occupied by Iraqi
troops.
   As of late yesterday, only six ministers had confirmed
they plan to attend, OPEC sources said. They are from
Algeria, Venezuela, Indonesia, Nigeria, Gabon and Iran.
   In Caracas, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said
seven nations -- the majority required to call a special
meeting of all 13 -- had agreed to be in Vienna for the
"consultative session" on possible oil production increases.
He didn't list the seven.
   The OPEC ministers cannot take official action unless they
are in a regular or special conference. But Celestino Armas,
the Venezuelan oil minister, said Venezuela's view is that
the ministerial majority expected in Vienna could turn the
talks into an emergency session at which decisions could be
made. He told the Venezuelan Congress that the national oil
companies already have begun pumping more, with an extra
350,000 barrels a day targeted that will be stored for
eventual sale abroad.
   Venezuela has been coordinating its efforts with those of
Saudi Arabia for several weeks. But the attendance of Saudi
Arabia in Vienna is a question mark. Hisham Nazer, the Saudi
oil minister, has been critical of the lack of any official
OPEC response to threatened shortages and volatile oil
markets.
   Yesterday, a person close to Saudi oil policies cited two
objections to "this so-called meeting" in Vienna. There was
no formal invitation to the oil ministers from Mr. Boussena,
he said, and there is no agenda. "What we have here is an
invitation to a Sunday barbecue party," he said.
   Others suggested, however, that the Saudis can hardly
afford to ignore the talks. "The only thing I can see
{developing at Vienna} is that Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and
the Emirates will be given some kind of blessing to produce
more," one senior OPEC delegate said.
