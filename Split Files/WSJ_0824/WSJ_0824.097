   NEW YORK -- Liz Claiborne Inc. said two of the company's
founders, designer Elizabeth Claiborne Ortenberg and her
husband, Arthur Ortenberg, resigned from its board.
   Walter Krieger, vice president of financial operations at
the women's apparel maker, said directors haven't yet
considered who will succeed the couple on the nine-member
board. He wouldn't comment on whether the resignations had
been expected.

   The couple retired from active management roles in May
1989. Before that, Ms. Claiborne Ortenberg had been president
and chairman, and Mr. Ortenberg, vice chairman.
   In a statement, the couple said they were retiring from
the board because of "growing pressures" on their time from
their charitable foundation, which is active on environmental
and social issues.
   The couple expressed confidence in the strategy planned by
the company's chairman, Jerome A. Chazen, another founder and
the company's largest inside shareholder.
   In the statement, Mr. Chazen said the company respected
the couple's decision, which he described as "obviously a
difficult one." He said the couple's values will remain at
the core of the company's culture.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Liz Claiborne shares
fell 25 cents yesterday to close at $23.50.
