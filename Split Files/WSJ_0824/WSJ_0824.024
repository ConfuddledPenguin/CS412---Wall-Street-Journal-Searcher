   TOKYO -- Two Japanese companies, the trading concern C.
Itoh &amp; Co. and the chemical plant engineering firm Chisso
Engineering Co., received an order valued at about 2.3
billion yen ($15.7 million) from Slovnaft State Enterprise of
Czechoslovakia to build a chemical plant in Bratislava,
officials of the companies said.
   Itoh and Chisso said the plant, to be completed in the
beginning of 1992, will produce isoparaffin, an additive for
use in unleaded, high-octane gasoline. With the new plant,
officials said, Czechoslovakia is expected to switch as much
as 60% of its domestic demand to unleaded gasoline from heavy
dependence on leaded gas.

   Coinciding with a move in Europe to prevent environmental
pollution, as well as with Czechoslovakia's auto production
project, the new plant will process 250,000 metric tons of
isoparaffin annually. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62
pounds.
