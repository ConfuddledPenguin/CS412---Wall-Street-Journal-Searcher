   NEW YORK -- A near meltdown in overseas stock markets,
coupled with still-rising oil prices, sent U.S. prices
plunging for the third straight day.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 76.73 points to
close at 2483.42 -- a level not seen since July 6, 1989. It
was the busiest day since Aug. 3, the day after Iraq stormed
into Kuwait and sent stock investors into a selling frenzy.
Volume was 250.4 million shares in New York Stock Exchange
trading.

   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices also fell, finishing
down 3/4 of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 of face amount.
That decline pushed the yield to 9.13%, its highest level
since April 1989. The dollar also skidded against most major
currencies as traders sold yen and dollars and bought Swiss
francs and British pounds.
   The volatile oil market helped push long-term bond prices
down, which added to the downdraft in stocks. The October
futures contract for crude oil at one point traded as high as
$32.35 a barrel, matching a level set in August 1983, before
falling back to $31.93, up 71 cents for the day.
   One of investors' fears, said Philip Braverman, chief
economist of DKB Securities, is "that in a hot war the oil
fields themselves would be damaged," keeping oil prices high
even if peace is restored.
   Among smaller stock investors, "There's been a crescendo
of selling and right now I'd say it may be reaching a peak,"
said Philip Dow, retail equity marketing manager at Piper,
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis. He said he has seen panic
selling among some small investors for about two weeks, but
not every client is bailing out of stocks.
   Thomas Quick, president of Quick &amp; Reilly, the discount
brokerage, said his sense of small investors' sentiment was
not panic but skittishness. He said Wednesday's retail
business was 52% sell orders, and although yesterday's action
was heavier and tilting more to selling than buying, it
wasn't a selling stampede.
   "I've been told by a lot of our branch managers that they
are getting more calls for quotes from people wondering at
this point whether the market can go any lower," he said.
"People are skittish but afraid of selling out just before a
rebound."
   Stock mutual funds continued to lose money yesterday as
frightened shareholders redeemed. But not everybody was
selling. "Most of the people who reacted to this thing
reacted in the first week," said a spokesman for Baltimore's
T. Rowe Price Associates. "While redemptions are higher than
normal, so are new sales. People are still buying. We've had
net cash outflows, but mainly because of exchanges." Among
the hardest hit funds at T. Rowe Price are its international
funds and its small company stock funds.
   "We've had a number of people moving into the money market
fund," says Kenneth Ruder, a senior vice president for
marketing at Denver's Financial Programs Inc. "For every ten
calls, maybe six callers are doing that. But others are
taking an aggressive stance and buying into energy and gold.
Utilities are also being looked at. Some are adding to their
existing equity accounts, taking this as a good opportunity
to buy at a lower price."
   Many institutional investors were bailing out in big
volume yesterday, however, traders said. They theorize that
these investors don't want to wait a day and risk getting
caught in the now-familiar scenario of a huge Friday sell-off
before a weekend when war could break out. Paul Hennessey,
head of equities trading at Boston Co., said he detected a
major push to the exits among institutions in the last hour
of trading, and little evidence of index-arbitrage program
activity.
   But here, too, the flight from stocks wasn't universal.
Ron Schroeder, chief investment officer at J.&amp; W. Seligman,
who manages about $800 million, said he is no longer a
seller. The sell-off "has been overdone," he said. "A
resolution in the Mideast -- either a military one or a
negotiated one -- would send the market upward. My feeling is
{the U.S. and its allies} get their ducks in row militarily,
and it's over quick and dirty. In the meantime, though, what
has crept into the market in the last two days is outright
fear."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in heavy trading. On the Big Board,
declining issues overwhelmed advancers, 1,645 to 148.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. But some short-term bills and notes were
unchanged or a bit higher.
