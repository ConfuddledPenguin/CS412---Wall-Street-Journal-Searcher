   International Business Machines Corp. will make its most
important mainframe-computer announcement in more than a
decade on Sept. 5, say industry executives, consultants and
customers.
   They say the new generation of machines -- the first since
1985 -- will initially provide twice the power of the current
generation. Also, over the next few years it will become
possible to lash as many as 16 of the new machines together
so tightly that they act as one computer.

   That enormous increase in computing power will address
problems all the way down to the time it takes to get a
response from an automated teller machine or a
credit-authorization device in a store.
   That leap should also ensure that the mainframe market
stays healthy at least through the middle of the decade,
despite continuing suggestions that the mainframe is a
dinosaur.
   At the same time, the new generation of machines may not
help IBM much, at least for the next few quarters. Industry
executives and consultants said the new mainframes won't be
available in volume until the second half of next year, and
customers typically stop buying the current generation while
they await the new one.
   In addition, IBM's main competitors are likely to have
similar machines available at the same time as IBM, instead
of trailing a year or two behind, as they have with past
generations. Thus IBM may continue to lose market share to
Hitachi Ltd. and Amdahl Corp., which is 46%-owned by Fujitsu
Ltd. and sells machines based on a Fujitsu design.
   Such concerns -- fueled by IBM's report of weak mainframe
sales in the second quarter -- have already helped knock
IBM's stock price down from $123.125 last month to close at
$96.875 yesterday, down $2.125 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   IBM, Armonk, N.Y., declined to comment on its mainframe
plans. But Gartner Group Inc., a market-research and
consulting firm in Stamford, Conn., says IBM will initially
announce two mainframe models. One, with four processors, is
expected to operate at 163 mips, or millions of instructions
per second. The other, with six processors, is expected to
run at 230 mips. By comparison, the most powerful machine IBM
currently sells runs at 112 mips.
   IBM is also expected to announce more-powerful
replacements for its highly successful 4381 line of
minicomputers and a related family of smaller and less
successful minicomputers, the 9370. So, in one swoop IBM will
be replacing its mainframe line and much of its minicomputer
line, together accounting for considerably more than half its
revenue and earnings.
   IBM's announcement will be "the most sweeping change in
its product line in the history of the company," says Dan
Mandresh, a securities analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Other analysts, a bit more cautious, still say IBM is
making more radical improvements in the power of the hardware
than it made in the mainframe generations announced at the
beginning of the 1980s and in the middle of that decade. The
ability to lash together numerous mainframes also marks a
major departure, bringing to the mainframe world many of the
benefits long looked-for in the esoteric world of parallel
processing -- where work is split up among hundreds or even
thousands of processors.
   Customers will also eventually benefit considerably from
the use in the new mainframes of fiber-optic channels. The
channels will let the mainframe talk much faster with
data-storage devices and let those devices be located even a
few miles from the mainframe -- currently, the distance can
be no more than 1,000 feet.
   The channels will help at a time when many companies are
trying to cut costs by consolidating their computer
operations.
   The various machines involved in the IBM announcement will
also be able to share work and talk more easily than in the
past. The mainframes, 4381s and 9370s, which all used similar
hardware in the past, will now also get similar software. One
operating system -- software that controls the basic
operations of a computer -- will now be available on that
entire range of machines.
   As far as the financial impact on IBM goes, much depends
on the replacement for the 4381 -- which is expected to be
available immediately and should be a hit. Gartner Group
estimates that there are 20,000 machines -- both 4381s and
certain old mainframes -- that could be replaced by the new
machine, whose cost can run into the millions of dollars. And
IBM hasn't significantly boosted the performance of the 4381
in years, so many users will be thirsting for a more-powerful
machine.
   To back and fill until the new mainframes are available,
IBM is also expected to try to get customers to move to the
next generation in two steps. They would get access right
away to the fiber-optic technology -- but at a price so high
that, in effect, they would be paying part of the price of a
new mainframe now in return for a discount when the new
machines become available.
   Will customers go along?
   "Most of the users we've talked to have been lukewarm at
best," says Jim Cassell, a consultant at Gartner Group.
   DuWayne Peterson, an executive vice president in charge of
data processing at Merrill Lynch, a big IBM customer, says,
"We're not in that frame of mind right now, I can tell you
that."
   IBM has been able to market its way out of trouble before,
and if the incentives are high enough, it can certainly get
some customers to go along. Larry Bacon, a senior vice
president at Travelers Corp., another big customer, says he
likes the scenario IBM has sketched out and might go through
the two-step transition.
   Ken Pontikes, chief executive officer of Comdisco Inc., a
computer leasing company, says, "I think IBM will have some
success with" the two-step process. He adds, though: "What
you don't see is pentup demand for the new machines. The
economy isn't exactly robust."
   Mr. Mandresh, the securities analyst, has sketched out a
scenario in which other product lines could take up the slack
as IBM waits for mainframe sales to kick in, and the company
could still earn $10.50 a share this year, even if mainframe
sales tumble 33% in the second half. That would be up a
healthy 16% from last year, when IBM earned $9.05 a share,
before the effect of a $2.4 billion charge related to job
cuts and plant consolidations.
   Others, however, are less sanguine. "I see four to six
quarters of pain," says Steve Cohen, a securities analyst at
SoundView Financial Group Inc. "Then IBM will slowly slip
away, because this time their technology will be third best
(after Hitachi and Amdahl). I think this'll be the time when
the Japanese finally eat their lunch."
   For its part, IBM doesn't seem to be worried about its
results this year. IBM Chairman John Akers said in an
interview early this month: "We're very encouraged by the
results we've had so far. . . . We expect to perform for the
rest of the year the way we expected to when the year began."
