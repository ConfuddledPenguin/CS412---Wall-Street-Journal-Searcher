   Personal Lives Is Said to Have Shifted

   Today's corporate executives have a different perspective
on family and personal lives than their predecessors of a
decade ago, a new survey shows.
   They're far more likely to have working spouses, and
they're more interested in spending time with their children,
the study found. They're also more likely to think about
retiring early.

   "The rise of the two-career family has significantly
changed executive priorities," says Lester B. Korn, chairman
of Korn/Ferry International executive recruiters, which
conducted the survey last year with the University of
California at Los Angeles Graduate School of Management, as
well as a similar study 10 years before.
   Some things haven't changed much, however. Based on 698
responses, the survey calculates that the typical executive
is much the same as in 1979: a 52-year-old white male,
married with two children, who grew up in a house where his
mother didn't work outside the home. Gains by women and
minorities have been tiny.
   The 1989 survey was sent to vice presidents and other
senior executives at Fortune 500 industrial and service
companies, "the group from which future CEOs and presidents
will be selected," the report said. Responsibility,
compensation and challenge remain the top three motivating
factors to these executives, the study says; but they are
less important across the board to today's executives, who
seek more satisfaction outside of work.
   However, the executives are less interested in spending
their leisure time on travel or education than were
executives in previous years, according to the
UCLA-Korn/Ferry survey. Spending time with spouses remained
in first place, followed by recreation. But the desire to
spend time with children rose to third place from fourth.
   One-fifth of the executives also reported they had refused
to relocate sometime during their career, with "family" as
the top reason given for turning down a move.
   The increased concern about family probably is due in part
to the growing number involved in dual-career families, the
report says. The proportion of executives whose spouses work
outside the home rose sharply, to 37% in 1989 from 14% in
1979, according to the study. Most work in professional and
technical jobs, but the percentage who work in clerical
positions dropped to 5% from 14% over the decade.
   Some experts, though, question how widespread the change
in family demographics is, particularly among those in the
traditionally male-dominated industrial companies. "While we
do see it in a broad sense in our male employees, we have no
evidence of it in senior management," says Faith Wohl, who
directs Du Pont Co.'s work and family, affirmative action and
diversity programs.
   At Du Pont, where 76% of the work force is male, the
company's extensive surveys have shown that male employees
are "feeling and expressing the impact of family issues on
the day-to-day job very openly," she says. "By and large,
senior management people in Du Pont aren't yet experiencing
that in their day-to-day lives."
   Instead, she sees the impact as coming from the
executives' daughters and sons who have dual-career
marriages. "The issue is hitting them not directly in their
own generation but in the next generation, and they're
starting to see the connections to family issues there," she
says.
   The executives' increased focus on a personal or home life
shows up in other ways as well in the survey. Compared with a
decade ago, more executives surveyed today would retire
early, and fewer would work as long as possible.
   "We've experienced an economic boom, careers for high
achievers have moved very quickly, and they've reaped major
financial rewards far faster than they had anticipated," says
Caroline W. Nahas, Korn/Ferry's managing partner for Southern
California. "There's been a shakeout in terms of people
saying `Gee, I've achieved all this and during that time I've
missed out on the personal life' and now they want to try to
balance that more."
   This isn't to say that today's executives aren't
competitive, the report says. More of them have ambitions for
the CEO's job or ownership of the company than was the case
10 years ago, the survey shows. More, too, are likely to
change companies, and a greater percentage are dissatisfied
with their careers.
   "The ambitions are still strong," says Ms. Nahas, but the
executives have reordered their priorities for their spare
time.
   The slowest change is in terms of opening the doors of the
executive suite to women and minorities. The percentage of
women at the top crawled to 3% from less than 1% in 1979.
Just over 1% of top executives are ethnic minorities, barely
higher than a decade before.
   Women haven't yet advanced to the top in big numbers
because of a "blend" of factors, says Ms. Nahas. Though
discrimination hasn't disappeared, she also sees women
"making other decisions, like going into other businesses,
and some who have dedicated themselves for the past 20 years
who are now trying to balance their lives or start families.
That whole convergence is limiting the numbers," of women
rising to the top of corporations.
   Du Pont's Ms. Wohl says she isn't surprised by the
survey's findings on the sparse number of senior women
executives. "I can look around in our company and others like
it and see that progress has been made, but it's been longer
than anyone envisioned for it to have an impact, especially
in large corporations," she says. Ten years ago, Du Pont had
nine women at manager level or above. Today, there are more
than 150 women in such senior positions, including women who
run large manufacturing plants.
   Though more women will advance with time, Ms. Wohl cites
other factors that "are still getting in the way" at many
companies. These include an uneasiness on the part of some
male executives with women in senior management positions,
she says, and inadequate efforts to help women with family
responsibilities move up in organizations.
   Many of the surveyed executives were more optimistic for
the future. Women will be a part of their corporation's
senior management team in 2000, said 68% of the executives.
Though the top 20 positions in their companies today are held
by an average 3% women, they predicted the percentage of
senior women will rise to an average 16% by the turn of the
century.
