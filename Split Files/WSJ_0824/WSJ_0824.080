   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. dropped its plans to market Maalox
antacid and other Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. products, bowing
to an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice Department.
   Federal prosecutors had challenged the marketing pact in a
lawsuit filed this month because it would give P&amp;G, makers of
Pepto-Bismol, too big a share of the over-the-counter stomach
remedies market. Justice Department officials estimate that
P&amp;G and Rorer had combined sales of $236 million in that $900
million market.

   While both companies still assert that joining forces
doesn't create antitrust problems, they decided they'd rather
quit than fight the U.S. government.
   For Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the immediate impact of the
failed marriage is a $30 million reduction in its pretax
income for fiscal 1990. That was the one-time payment
expected from P&amp;G for the right to market Maalox and other
products.
   In 1989, Rorer Group Inc. reported net income of $86.5
million on sales of $1.2 billion. This year Paris-based
Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a chemical company, merged most of its
drug business with Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
   The marketing and distribution pact included several
over-the-counter and prescription drugs, such as Perdiem, a
laxative, and Ascriptin, a combination analgesic-antacid. But
Maalox seemed to be the most appealing label to P&amp;G because
it is the leading antacid in the U.S., with about a 15%
market share. The marketing agreement also was an inexpensive
way for P&amp;G to launch new products under the Maalox name.
   Now some industry experts say P&amp;G will unveil its own
antacid brand or sell new products under the Pepto-Bismol
name. P&amp;G offered no clues, saying only that it remains
interested in antacids.
   Although Rhone-Poulenc Rorer says it will continue to
manage the Maalox business, as well as the other brands,
others expect new suitors to offer marketing proposals.
   The dilemma for Rorer in the past has been how to spend
heavily on Maalox marketing while also building its research
and development program. P&amp;G was a good partner because it
has the marketing clout to build up the brand.
   "The vast majority of the drug industry was interested the
last time, so there are plenty of places to go," said Gary
Stibel, a consultant with New England Consulting Group, which
has represented drug companies in such ventures. "The
question is, what will the feds allow?"
