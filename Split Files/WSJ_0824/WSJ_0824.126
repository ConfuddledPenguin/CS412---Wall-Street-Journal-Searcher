   A group of disgruntled investors asked Justin Industries
Inc. to put to a shareholder vote the company's proposed
acquisition of Tony Lama Co.
   In a letter to the Justin board, Perry H. Sutherland of
Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York,
leaders of a group that owns about 11.8% of Justin, called
the proposed transaction "astonishing" and said they would
"review all of our options to protect our 1,000,000-plus
share investment in the company and that of our fellow
shareholders." An offer by the group to purchase the shares
of Justin it didn't already own was rejected this year by the
Justin board.

   In Dallas, Justin declined to comment on the request for a
vote.
   Justin has agreed to acquire Tony Lama, based in El Paso,
Texas, for $9 a share, or about $18 million, plus the
assumption of about $34 million in debt. In the first half of
1990, Tony Lama had a loss of $901,000, or 47 cents a share,
after a loss of $1.8 million, or 95 cents a share, in 1989.
Both companies make Western boots; Justin also makes building
supplies and industrial equipment.
