   Saddam Hussein has brought the lion out of George Bush on
foreign policy. Newt Gingrich hopes he'll start roaring on
the homefront too.
   In the Mideast, Mr. Bush has his goals straight and his
strategy clear. Back home, things are a mess. Stocks and
bonds are falling, the economy's stalled and the dollar is as
weak as the Kuwaiti emir. The White House goal of a
tax-raising deficit-reduction deal looks beside the point, if
not dangerous. This is no way to fight a war.

   Mr. Gingrich, the number-two Republican in the House, is
the cavalry riding to the rescue. Instead of higher taxes,
he's putting together a package of tax cuts to abort a
recession. As for the deficit, he wants the president to
finally get tough on spending. "The world that existed at the
beginning of the budget summit is over," says the man some
Democrats consider the domestic Saddam Hussein.
   Mr. Gingrich may seem a lonely partisan, but he actually
reflects a much broader unhappiness with White House economic
policy. It's the tip of an iceberg that cuts through much of
the Cabinet, the Federal Reserve, Republicans in Congress,
even parts of the White House. Before going public, Mr.
Gingrich spent days calling around the administration to
sample opinion, try out ideas. He was startled by the support
he found.
   By breaking ranks publicly, Mr. Gingrich is nonetheless
taking a risk. As a budget summiteer he wants to be loyal to
George Bush, but also show him there's a policy alternative.
He isn't yet walking out of the summit, merely putting
different ideas on the table. He wants to attract Mr. Bush,
not fight him.
   His real fight is with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and Budget Director Richard Darman, the twin peaks of Bush
economic policy. The pair told the president that if he
played his ace -- the no-new-tax pledge -- a deficit deal
with Democrats would follow. But Democrats pocketed the card
and raised the ante. They're dumbstruck that Republicans have
been such patsies. Mr. Darman has believed that only
bipartisan good-feeling can produce the grand deal he's
longed for; he hasn't delivered.
   On economic substance, the Brady-Darman axis has muted
calls for a capital gains tax cut, but shouted for easier
money. Mr. Brady's recent Fed-bashing -- timed just when oil
was shooting into the mid-$20s-a-barrel -- has unsettled even
some who think the Fed's been too tight in the past. Mr.
Gingrich calls this the "Hoover-Carter technique."
   The Georgian hopes to persuade Mr. Bush that Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell "is not Hosni Mubarak" -- the
Egyptian president and now U.S. ally. Mr. Mitchell, he says,
"gets up every morning thinking, `How can I defeat George
Bush today.'" Mr. Bush, a trusting man, has a hard time
believing Democrats can be so implacable.
   Mr. Gingrich says Republicans have to start playing
offense. Veto fat spending bills. Let the Gramm-Rudman budget
sword fall, at least at first. Brady-Darman will insist that
with the crisis in Iraq, this is no time to be tough at home.
But with the president's popularity so high, now is exactly
the time to demand spending discipline: Guns or butter, but
not both. Mr. Bush's press conference last week was a start,
but Democrats and the press think it's only a phony war. They
won't negotiate seriously until they see the tanks deployed
on their border.
   Understandably, the Brady-Darman axis frowns on Mr.
Gingrich. After the Georgian criticized their strategy on
"Meet the Press" on July 29, he was privately rebuked by Mr.
Brady. When he attacked Democrats the following week, senior
officials backgrounded reporters that Mr. Gingrich "was not
constructive." This week, Messrs. Darman and Gingrich have
had what one aide euphemistically calls "candid" talks. Mr.
Darman persuaded him to drop support for a cut in the Social
Security payroll tax, but not for other tax cuts.
   Brady-Darman know they can still count on the loyalty of
most GOP budget summiteers. Congressional leaders Bob Dole
and Bob Michel are stalwart for higher taxes. Others are
watching Mr. Gingrich, but keeping their distance. Even one
natural ally, Texas conservative Sen. Phil Gramm, says he
still wants a budget deal.
   "I don't want higher taxes," Mr. Gramm said this week.
"But the American people elected Democrats, and that's their
price for spending cuts. Maybe this is a good civics lesson."
Not to mention an expensive one. The irony is that Mr. Gramm
is a summiteer in part because of Mr. Gingrich; the Georgian
told the White House he wouldn't even participate in the
summit unless Mr. Gramm was also invited.
   So the Gingrich effort is a long shot, but consider this
scenario: A budget deal goes to Congress, and the leadership
is urging members to vote for higher taxes with only token
spending cuts. Mr. Gingrich, backed by 90 or so Republicans,
is offering the alternative of real spending cuts and lower
taxes. How many Democrats, preparing for November elections,
will begin to get cold feet? "I think it would be very, very
close," says Mr. Gingrich.
   Skeptics might also consider this: Those who say Mr.
Gingrich can't win now are the same people who said he'd
never depose a speaker of the House, and never win election
as House GOP whip, either.
