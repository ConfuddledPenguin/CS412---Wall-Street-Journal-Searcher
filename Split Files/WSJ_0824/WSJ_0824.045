   TAIF, Saudi Arabia -- Officials of Kuwait's
government-in-exile here say Iraqi troops have mined most of
Kuwait's oil wells and threatened to blow them up if Iraq's
occupying forces are attacked.
   The officials also described life in the captured city of
Kuwait, where they said resistance to the Iraqis, led by
neighborhood cooperatives and Kuwaiti women, continues to
build.

   "We are willing to sacrifice everything -- not only our
money, but also our blood -- for the liberation of our
country," said Crown Prince Saad Abdullah al-Sabah, the
second-ranking official in the Kuwaiti government.
   He and Ali Jaber al-Sabah, brother-in-law of the emir of
Kuwait, said that some Kuwaitis who had fled the oil-rich
Persian Gulf country have been infiltrating back to organize
armed resistance. Some of them are officers of Kuwait's
military.
   Mr. Jaber, who is also marketing director of the
state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp., said the company is
buying 250,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia and
other Gulf states and will continue to supply its gasoline
stations and refineries in Europe.
   The two Kuwaiti officials spoke at a hotel in this resort
city in the mountains near Jeddah and the Red Sea. The hotel,
tightly guarded by Saudi soldiers, has been turned into the
exile headquarters of the Kuwaiti government. It is near the
summer palace of King Fahd, the ruler of Saudi Arabia. Saudi
officials flew foreign reporters from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
to the news conference here.
   Mr. Jaber said dynamite had been attached to what are
called "Christmas trees," elaborate systems of valves
attached to the tops of oil wells. He said the Iraqis so far
haven't wired detonators to the explosives. If Kuwait's
fields were damaged by explosions, he said, they could be
brought back to production within six months.
   Citing reports from within Kuwait, he said the Iraqi army
has attempted to stop demonstrations and other acts of
disobedience by women and children by arresting them and
imprisoning them in two downtown palaces. He described the
palaces as "concentration camps" where some women are beaten.
   Nonetheless, he said, the demonstrations continue, with
women taunting the Iraqi soldiers from the rooftops every
night, shouting "Allahu akbar" to indicate that they fear
only God.
   Iraqi soldiers, according to Mr. Jaber, fear snipers and
have stopped patrolling at night, leaving the streets to
groups organized by neighborhood residents to prevent
looting. Other teams, mostly young men, collect garbage and
help distribute food.
   Young Kuwaitis, he said, have killed Iraqi cab drivers
bringing carloads of looters from Basra in Iraq. They also
have firebombed vans loaded with stolen furniture as looters
drove them north into Iraq.
   Iraqi soldiers, he said, also have been looting each
other. "The Iraqi soldier who steals cars and takes them to
the border is often met by a bigger fish who takes it from
him," said Mr. Jaber. He explained that the "bigger fish" is
usually a more senior military officer.
   He said Kuwaiti workers continue to pump 200,000 barrels
of oil a day from the captured fields, just enough to run the
local power plant and water desalination facility. Otherwise,
according to Mr. Jaber, Kuwaitis generally are refusing to
return to work.
   Mr. Jaber confirmed news reports that a warning from
Kuwait's Defense Ministry thwarted an Iraqi attempt to
capture the emir and the crown prince when Iraq's tank forces
invaded Kuwait in the early hours of Aug. 2.
   Although enemy helicopters were landing at the emir's
palace, the two rulers managed to escape by car, driving
south to the Saudi border.
   "The Kuwaiti government is alive and well," the crown
prince told reporters. "We are receiving reports from our
brothers in Kuwait and from our embassies all over the
world."
