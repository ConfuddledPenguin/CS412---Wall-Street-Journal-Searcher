   The first set of commandments to be issued from the Middle
East comprised 10 items. T.E. Lawrence settled on no fewer
than 27.
   Lawrence of Arabia, as he is known to video-store owners
if not to historians, urged Englishmen plunging into the
business of the region to speak tribal dialects of Arabic, to
avoid being "too intimate, too prominent or too earnest," to
"cling tight to your sense of humor" and to "let it be
clearly known that you are a British officer and a
Christian." And, of course, a helpful word about fashion: "If
you wear Arab things, wear the best."

   All sensible advice, of course, for Lawrence of Arabia was
a sensible, not to say sensitive, man, far deeper than the
image that has been passed down to us in an era when the
region has been shorn of its romance and when colonial
meddling has been discredited in polite society.
   In "Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorized Biography of T.E.
Lawrence" (Atheneum, 1,188 pages, $35), Jeremy Wilson argues
that Lawrence was a figure of substantial diplomatic and
literary achievement, a man who reshaped the Middle East in
the dust of battle and, later, in the polished salons of
diplomacy. His "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" sold more than a
million copies; his translation of the Odyssey is still
available. All that and a figure of mystery and legend]
"Public enthusiasm for media idols is usually short-lived,"
Mr. Wilson writes, "but in Lawrence's case it has endured for
more than 65 years."
   Mr. Wilson is not, of course, the first to bury himself in
the life of T.E. Lawrence. He was preceded by a remarkable
constellation of literary stars, among them Robert Graves,
Andre Malraux, Liddell Hart and Lowell Thomas, who played a
major role in the myth-making in the first place. Mr. Wilson
himself spent a decade sifting through letters, telegrams and
documents. The result is a narrative taking the reader from
Lawrence's birth in Wales and his rearing in Scotland,
Jersey, Brittany and England to his archaeological trips to
Carchemish, his work in the Arab Revolt and his activities in
the Colonial Office, all the way to his death in a traffic
accident in 1935.
   As a university student Lawrence once worked 45
consecutive hours, a kind of Oxonian Outward Bound designed
to test his endurance. Indeed, his form master in school in
1901 had noted that the young Lawrence was, "unlike the boys
of his age and time" and was possessed of "an apparent
indifference toward pleasure or pain." He also was different
in that, before he was 10, he was aware of his own
illegitimacy -- a fact that Mr. Wilson gives great
importance. "As a result," Mr. Wilson says, "he would have to
build up his own identity and self-esteem through personal
achievement and moral integrity."
   But this is no psychobio piled deep with babble; if
anything Mr. Wilson errs on the side of prim historical
practice, piling detail on detail, digressing to provide
background and to steer the reader through some of the feuds,
rivalries, land claims and religious zealotries that make
Middle Eastern history such forbidding territory.
   Along with the story of Lawrence, Mr. Wilson provides
insights into the underpinnings of British foreign policy
during the World War I period and shortly thereafter,
especially the delicate balancing act required by a country
that nurtured native nationalist movements in the Middle East
while resisting them in India.
   Mr. Wilson portrays Lawrence as something of a
partisan-in-residence in the British intelligence operation
before becoming a player in the Arab revolt itself. On his
first military operation, he executed a Moroccan who had
committed a murder. Soon he was ambushing railways and
cutting telegraph wires. He encountered boils, high fevers
and buffeting by "a breathless wind, with the furnace taste."
The Turks put a #20,000 price on his head.
   Col. Cyril Wilson, British representative in Jidda,
thought him "a bumptious young ass." Churchill thought of
Lawrence as "someone strangely enfranchised, untamed,
untrammeled by convention, moving independently of the
ordinary currents of human action." But Mr. Wilson defends
his man's "remarkable grasp of the political and military
situation."
   Lawrence spent years brooding over his books, the
immorality of the war years and his lack of sexuality, all
the time seeking anonymity far from the madding crowd. Mr.
Wilson argues that Lawrence had a "deep revulsion" toward sex
of any sort. He tells us that Lawrence hid in the barracks as
an aircraftman, tested a new line of high-speed military
boats and wrote reams of letters to George Bernard Shaw and
his wife. Some thought him a self-promoter, some a spy. He
thought he was a great writer. I hope "I shall be appraised
rather as a man of letters than as a man of action," he wrote
Robert Graves.
   A vain hope, in all probability. But in a book too long
about a life too short, Mr. Wilson portrays him as both. Even
Lawrence of Arabia wouldn't quibble with that.
