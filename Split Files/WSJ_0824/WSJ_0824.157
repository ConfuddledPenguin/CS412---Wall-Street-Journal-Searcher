   NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of the New York Post announced
the resignation of Valerie Salembier as president of the
newspaper.
   Ms. Salembier, the former publisher of TV Guide, was named
to the post in April 1989.

   Peter Kalikow, the Post's owner and publisher, said he
would reassume the title of president.
   Ms. Salembier, who supervised business, advertising and
circulation, said she felt it was time "to move forward to
new challenges and opportunities."
   "She has successfully structured a business operation
which has effectively positioned the New York Post for sales
and profit growth in the '90s," Mr. Kalikow said.
   Last November, the Post discontinued its eight-month-old
Sunday edition, which failed to attract sufficient
advertisers or readers and lost millions of dollars.
