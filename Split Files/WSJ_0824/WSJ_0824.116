   Amdura Corp., a Denver-based automotive and hardware
distributor and specialty manufacturer, said it completed a
previously announced sale of assets in its Coast to Coast
Stores Inc. subsidiary to Servistar Corp., a dealer-owned
hardware cooperative based in Butler, Pa.
   Amdura said cash received at closing totaled about $52.5
million, though Coast to Coast's estate might receive
additional payments of as much as $6.5 million, depending on
Servistar's success in signing up additional independently
owned Coast to Coast Stores. The Coast to Coast unit sells
hardware to individually owned retail stores operating under
the Coast to Coast franchise.

   The assets involved in the Coast to Coast transaction
included inventory, two distribution centers and Coast to
Coast's trademarks; Amdura said the deal excluded receivables
and various other Coast to Coast assets. Amdura and its
hard-lines distribution subsidiaries, including Coast to
Coast Stores, filed for protection last April from creditors'
lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
pending formation of a reorganization plan.
