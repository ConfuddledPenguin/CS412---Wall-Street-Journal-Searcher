   PHILADELPHIA -- As the stock market sinks into the depths
on fears of war and recession, why is Scott Paper one of the
few paper companies bobbing along with only a minor dip?
   It can't be the company's earnings. The maker of bathroom
tissue, paper towels and printing papers earned about $4.11 a
share last year before one-time gains, almost the same as in
1988 and well below the $5 some analysts expected. And this
year's first-half earnings of $1.83 a share were 11% below
the year-ago profit, prompting even the most bullish analysts
to project another flat full year.

   It isn't the dividend that's attracting investors; Scott
yields a modest 1.8%. Clearly, it isn't the state of the
paper industry, which is in the midst of a cyclical downturn.
Nor is the Street abuzz about the double-digit earnings
growth Scott has achieved under Philip E. Lippincott who, in
1983, became chief executive officer and began to revitalize
the company.
   What is buoying Scott's stock is a widespread belief that
the company is just about recession-proof. Never mind that
paper-products companies' stocks are down 17% since year end
and that the market is off 13%, as measured by the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index. Scott is down less than 3% year-to-date,
despite a 2 1/4 drop yesterday to 43 7/8.
   The case for the stock is simple: "Tissue is more
necessary than discretionary," says Gary Palmero, an
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst. If anything, he says, Scott should
see demand surge, as its new machines in France, Italy, and
Spain come on line and it assimilates a recently acquired 51%
of Feldmuhle AG's European tissue operations. Use of sanitary
tissue products is growing steadily in Western Europe, where
it now stands at 15 pounds a year per capita compared with
more than 39 pounds for Americans.
   Costs are declining for pulp, the tree fibers used to make
paper. List prices for one benchmark pulp grade are off $40 a
ton from last year's peak and heading lower, says Evadna Lynn
of Dean Witter Reynolds.
   Ms. Lynn recently began following Scott with a strong
"buy" recommendation. She estimates that every $50-a-ton drop
in pulp prices adds about 25 cents a share to the company's
final profit.
   Although costly production snafus have dogged Scott's
printing paper division, "the problems are diminishing," says
George Adler of Smith Barney. He expects Scott to earn about
$4.75 a share in 1991.
   The stock is a bargain at yesterday's level of about 10
times estimated earnings for 1990, Mr. Adler says. "The
market is taking a `show me' attitude," he says. Even
Kimberly-Clark, a recent favorite of recession-wary
investors, is comparatively expensive at about 12 times this
year's estimate of earnings before a one-time charge.
   As the market recognizes Scott's value, Mr. Adler says, he
sees Scott's share price rising to about $55 in the next six
months and to "at least" $65 by the end of 1991.
   But some analysts caution that Scott's recent performance
has so far offered little proof of its supposed potential.
Furthermore, the bears say Scott isn't quite as
recession-resistant as some investors believe.
   Scott is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the
market for its cash cow, printing papers, says Bruce Kirk, an
analyst with S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. In 1989, 44% of Scott's
pretax operating profit came from that division.
   "In some way, shape or form, coated paper ends up in
advertising-related businesses" such as magazines and
catalogs, Mr. Kirk says, adding: "If the economy in general
is soft, the advertising is sluggish with it, and coated
paper doesn't grow."
   Rival makers of coated paper will be adding new machines
in the next two years, threatening overcapacity.
"Coated-paper prices will come under pressure," says Sherman
Chao of Salomon Brothers. In the tissue business, Europe
could become a profitless battleground if Kimberly, Scott,
James River and European companies slash prices to capture
market share.
   Meanwhile, skeptics contend that investors in the stock
may be setting themselves up for a beating on the next poor
earnings report. "Investors have been willing to give Scott
Paper and its management the benefit of the doubt, saying
`Let's wait one more quarter,'" Mr. Chao asserts. "At some
point, someone is going to give up," he adds.
