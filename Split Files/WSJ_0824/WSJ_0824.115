   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. said its board
authorized it to repurchase as many as 20 million, or roughly
10%, of its 204 million shares outstanding.
   Buying that many shares at the stock's current price would
cost about $665 million.

   Chairman Gordon E. Moore said recent declines in the
semiconductor maker's stock price have made its shares a
bargain. Analysts attribute at least part of the decline to
concern over the outcome of a copyright dispute with Advanced
Micro Devices pending in federal court.
   "We think the market's rapid retreat in the past few weeks
presents us with an opportunity to buy back our shares at
attractive levels," Mr. Moore said.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Intel closed at
$33.25 a share, up $1.25, despite a continued decline in the
overall market.
   Mr. Moore said the company can afford the program. "Even
after completion of this program, we will continue to have
the strong cash position needed to assure that we can
continue our capital and {research and development} programs
with complete flexibility," Mr. Moore said. A spokesman said
the company had $1.5 billion cash on hand as of June 30 and
doesn't anticipate taking on any new debt to finance the
buyback.
   Intel's only previous buy-back was in 1987, when it
purchased 13.4 million of its shares from International
Business Machines Corp. for $27 a share.
