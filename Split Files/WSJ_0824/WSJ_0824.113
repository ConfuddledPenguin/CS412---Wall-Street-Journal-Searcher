   Goal Systems Inc. said it settled a lawsuit by Computer
Associates International Inc. of California.
   The settlement provides for an undisclosed series of fixed
payments to Computer Associates, and resulted in a
second-quarter charge of $530,000, or two cents a share.

   The suit claimed that Goal's JOBTRAC and RUNTRAC products
infringed on Computer Associates' copyrights, and used
misappropriated trade secrets.
   Separately, Goal, an Ohio-based software products concern,
said net income from the second quarter, ended July 31, was
$2.1 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $26.4
million. In the year-ago period, Goal Systems reported a
restated net income of $1.6 million, or nine cents a share,
on revenue of $19.7 million.
