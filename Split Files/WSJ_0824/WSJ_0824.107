   RAS TANURA, Saudi Arabia -- Iraqi threats of invasion and
sabotage apparently haven't prompted stepped-up security
measures at Saudi Arabian oil installations strung out along
the northern Persian Gulf.
   From the giant refinery complex here to the mammoth
offshore oil and gas fields near Tanjib, less than an hour's
drive from Iraqi tank formations, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. has
done little to reinforce the company guards that remain its
primary protection against any Iraqi-sponsored terrorists,
according to employees and U.S. military officials.

   "They haven't beefed up security at all," said Victor
Perrin, who recently resigned from his job training Saudi
workers and is returning to the U.S. with his wife and two
small children. "Their whole policy is business as usual."
   Neil Hjelle, a communications specialist who has worked
for Saudi Aramco for 13 years, said: "Security actually has
been a little bit looser in the past week or two. There is no
indication of increased plant surveillance."
   Saudi officials declined to comment on security
arrangements.
   In contrast, U.S. military commanders have focused on the
dangers of potential terrorist attacks from the first day
troops arrived, and senior officers have put in place
unprecedented security measures to protect U.S. troops from
that possibility.
   To some extent, the security issue reflects broader
differences between the way many Saudi leaders and U.S.
commanders view the current standoff with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein. Some Saudi Aramco directors have suggested to
worried employees that the terrorist threat posed by Iraq and
its supporters hasn't increased significantly since the
invasion of Kuwait. According to Mr. Perrin, one predicted
this week that if shooting breaks out, "the war will never be
fought on Saudi soil."
   On the other hand, many U.S. commanders remain concerned
about Iraq's potential ability to damage vital Saudi
facilities. "Don't ever forget their tanks are close enough
to reach important plants without having to refuel," said a
Pentagon planner.
   U.S. military analysts also have stressed that the
oil-field region is home to nearly all of Saudi Arabia's
potentially rebellious Shiite Moslem minority. Two years ago,
Saudi Aramco officials discovered a bomb planted in one of
the facilities. A number of suspects were arrested, and
employees said the incident prompted a reassessment of the
company's security procedures, but they said few changes were
made.
   The company is believed to have developed emergency
evacuation plans, but employees said they haven't received
any information about what those plans involve.
   According to some Saudi officials, Egyptian troops will
take up positions near some oil facilities in the next few
days as U.S. troops redeploy to get maximum defensive
firepower close to the Iraqi border.
   Meanwhile, there appears to be little concern about the
Iraqi threat in commercial centers in this section of Saudi
Arabia. Stores and shopping areas are as busy as they were
before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and there don't
appear to be additional guards posted around government
buildings. In fact, security officers manning one of the
gates at Saudi Aramco's headquarters complex this week
allowed a taxi carrying an employee and this reporter to
enter without asking for identification from both passengers.
