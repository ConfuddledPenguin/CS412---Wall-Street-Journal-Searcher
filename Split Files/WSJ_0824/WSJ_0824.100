   BONN -- By highlighting an investigation against some 60
companies suspected of sending illegal exports to Iraq, the
West German Economics Ministry is trying to deflect criticism
that might be heaped on Bonn in the event of a Middle East
war.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said
yesterday that 25 West German firms were under investigation
for criminal offenses involving the export of weapons and
weapons-related technology to Baghdad. Ministry officials
also confirmed that as many as 34 other companies are
suspected of less serious export violations involving Iraq.

   Mr. Haussmann said in a statement he plans to tighten
export-control laws sharply and urged West German businesses
"to be especially careful" in their dealings with sensitive
exports. Meanwhile, the West Germans appear to be cracking
down on some of the most serious violators. Last Friday,
authorities arrested seven people suspected of supplying Iraq
with equipment needed to make chemical weapons.
   The arrests and Mr. Haussmann's statements, which didn't
mention any individual or company names or even specify the
illegal exports, come at a sensitive moment for the West
German government. The U.S. is pressuring Bonn to take a more
active role in international military operations aimed at
containing Iraq. But the West Germans insist their Basic Law
prohibits them from sending troops outside the region of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. West German officials
have said they're considering changing their Basic Law, but
that could prove difficult.
   If the West Germans insist on staying away from the
confrontation, they could face particularly heavy criticism
among their allies for earlier exports that helped Iraq build
up its arsenal. While many countries, including France and
the Soviet Union, supplied weapons to Iraq, German firms are
thought to have spearheaded the development of Baghdad's
chemical-weapons and munitions industries.
   The main question is why Bonn waited so long to take
action. Even Mr. Haussmann concedes that most of the
deliveries occurred "long ago" and only came to his attention
as a result of the Middle East crisis. The first flurry of
concern about questionable West German exports can be traced
to 1988, when Iraq unleashed poison gas on the
Iranian-occupied town of Halabja, where, some analysts
believe, 5,000 Kurdish civilians died.
   West German law bans the sale of any weapons to an area of
conflict, which included Iraq throughout the 1980s. But much
of what was sold falls into a category of goods that is
difficult to control: technology and equipment that have
legitimate commercial uses but that can also be used to
produce weapons. Chemical weapons plants, for instance, are
similar to those used to make pesticides and herbicides. West
Germany began requiring export licenses for such dual-use
equipment only in 1984, and enforcement has been spotty.
   Economics Ministry officials say they have tightened
export controls since early 1989, though they concede some
important regulations are still waiting approval by the West
German parliament. Those measures came in the wake of a
scandal in which West German firms helped Libya develop a
chemical-weapons plant.
   West German officials say they plan to expand the
penalties for those caught circumventing export regulations.
In the wake of the Libyan scandal, West Germany increased the
maximum penalty for those caught selling nuclear or chemical
weapons technology to 10 years from three. Mr. Haussmann now
says he wants to increase the maximum to 15 years.
