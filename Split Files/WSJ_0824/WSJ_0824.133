   NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- This is no Houston, where the economy
truly crashed in the 1980s. Nor is it New England, with its
collapsing high-tech and defense economy.
   But Nashville has its problems. Too many office buildings
and too many apartments. Some financially strapped banks. A
spreading credit squeeze. And worries about spiraling oil
prices.

   In short, Nashville is a microcosm of what is happening in
many cities around the U.S. It is a city on the brink of
recession, with definite strengths but facing undeniable
difficulties, many of them traceable to the rambunctious
economics of the '80s. What Nashville is up against is
illustrative of the kind of forces that many regional
economies are having to wrestle with in these uncertain
times.
   On a seedy street downtown, George Gruhn has come up
against Nashville's credit squeeze. His business is selling
vintage guitars, banjos and mandolins, and at almost $3
million a year the business is booming, thanks partly to
demand from Japan and Germany. Time to expand.
   Mr. Gruhn wants to buy a vacant Victorian-era building
next door for $185,000. The problem is getting a loan. "My
bankers haven't turned me down, but they're making me jump
through hoops," he says. "If it's real estate, they're
scared."
   Many of Nashville's bankers are afraid to lend to anybody,
after having made hundreds of millions of dollars of
now-soured real-estate loans in the 1980s. "An unspoken wave
of caution" pervades the bank, says Neil Cunningham,
executive vice president of First American Corp., the parent
of one of Nashville's biggest banks. "You're dealing with
human emotion."
   That emotional reaction is evident even though much of the
area's economy is fairly strong, bolstered by a prosperous
mix of the music business, services, large-scale
manufacturing and state-government jobs. Employment is up a
bit from 1989 levels, and retail and home sales are running
about 5% ahead. But now the crisis in the Middle East has
Nashville economists worried that soaring oil prices may tip
a fragile economy into a recession.
   "We're on the brink," says Don Belcher, director of
research at the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce. "With
this Kuwait thing, all bets are off." A surge in gasoline
prices could hurt Nashville's tourist industry; most visitors
to Opryland U.S.A. come by car. And bankers could become even
more cautious.
   The bankers' multiple fears are understandable. This past
spring was a nightmare at First American Corp., parent of
First American National Bank. Federal examiners took a harsh
view of its loan portfolio, and First American increased its
bad-loan reserve by nearly $100 million. On May 29, its board
fired the chairman and president, Kenneth L. Roberts. And
this week, the company said it would eliminate up to 380 jobs
over the next 18 months.
   Many other Nashville lenders, such as Third National Bank
and Metropolitan Federal Savings &amp; Loan, have taken some big
hits, especially in real-estate lending. Yet some, including
the Sovran Bank unit of Sovran Financial Corp., are burdened
with relatively few bad loans.
   The real-estate and banking problems have stunned the
local business community, but no one knows how severely they
will damage the city. If bankers in Nashville -- and around
the nation -- overreact and slash credit across the board,
the fragile U.S. economy, now in its 92nd month of expansion,
could fall into recession. Yet Nashville, like many
communities, retains enough strength to suggest that it will
gradually rebound.
   "I don't know if Nashville has found the bottom, but I
think the bottom is reasonably near," says John Clay, the
chief executive of Third National Bank, a unit of SunTrust
Banks in Atlanta. He doesn't minimize the real-estate debacle
or the banks' role. "The banks have been running all over
each other to do deals," he says. "It's time to pay the
piper."
   The excessive deal-making is typical of what happened in
many cities. In Nashville, it occurred partly because of all
the newcomers who arrived during the 1980s, especially Texas
and Louisiana builders who flocked here and built with little
regard to local competitors or even to what the market would
bear. Many of them are now gone, but their legacy is an array
of empty buildings and lost fortunes.
   The real-estate splurge began here in 1985, a couple of
years after Nissan put an auto plant at nearby Smyrna, Tenn.,
and about the time that General Motors picked a site 35 miles
southwest of Nashville for its Saturn plant. Then American
Airlines selected Nashville as a regional hub. Meanwhile, the
Texas oil patch was starting to dry up. Nashville was touted
as the next boom town.
   Dozens of Southwestern developers, backed by their banks,
headed north. Some speculated in land near the Saturn plant
or in the exurban ring around Nashville. The out-of-town land
speculators became known as "dirt flippers." A flipper would
buy farm land for perhaps $2,000 an acre and try to trade it
for a higher price. It often worked. Prices doubled, then
doubled again in some instances.
   On the expensive land sprang up expensive houses, many of
them too expensive for Nashville buyers. Today, the market is
glutted with large, luxurious houses.
   Far more serious, however, is the apartment glut.
Developers -- locals and Texans alike -- put up huge
apartment complexes, often in the same neighborhoods with
splendid disregard for each other. The result: An area might
have 3,000 apartments, but only 1,000 can be filled.
   To some observers, the lack of coordination in building
apartments is just a symptom of a leadership vacuum. Only a
few years ago, most of Nashville's big institutions were
locally run. "The good old boys, a small, tight-knit group of
15 people, pretty much controlled the town, from the arts to
the lending policies," says John Haggard, a business
consultant.
   Now, many local business chiefs are out of the picture
through death or retirement. One who recently died was Jack
Massey, who built Kentucky Fried Chicken and founded Hospital
Corp. of America.
   And many local businesses were acquired by corporations
based elsewhere. Today, three of Nashville's four biggest
banks are subsidiaries of out-of-state companies. The two
most visible factories are the auto plants. Even Music Row is
becoming dominated by faraway companies such as Sony Corp.'s
CBS records.
   And so in Nashville, as in many cities, power has
gradually passed from leading local families to corporate
bureaucrats, many of them based out of town. The loss of
local control over economic decisions explains some of the
overbuilding.
   But does all this indicate a leadership vacuum? "I think
that's a lot of baloney," says Mr. Clay at Third National
Bank. Though conceding that Nashville's business leadership
is in "transition," he says a new generation of local leaders
is emerging and will gradually become stronger.
   Of course, local leaders had no control over the 1986
tax-revision act, which, as much as anything else, damaged
the Nashville apartment market by phasing out tax breaks
given real-estate investors.
   Beginning in 1988, in the wake of the 1986 tax-law
changes, the limited-partnership real-estate industry
spiraled downward. The apartments didn't fill up, syndicators
such as Freeman Cos. ran into financial problems, and the
banks that lent to entrepreneurs like Richard Freeman had to
write off much of the credit.
   The syndicators' investors and employees also got hurt.
Deborah Clarke, one veteran of the roller-coaster world of
real-estate syndication, says, "I kind of felt I was part of
the San Francisco gold rush. I went out and had my
adventure."
   And some misadventure. She and her husband, David, were
among those who had migrated to Tennessee from Texas. Mr.
Clarke owned a construction company that went belly up in the
Texas real-estate bust of the mid-1980s. Mrs. Clarke worked
for former Gov. John Connolly's real-estate partnership in
Austin. That, too, went awry, and she lost her job.
   In 1988, the Clarkes moved to Nashville, where Mrs. Clarke
took a job at JacquesMiller Inc. Mrs. Clarke, as the
real-estate syndicator's vice president of finance, had to
scramble to refinance maturing real-estate loans. As the
credit squeeze hit, that got harder and harder. She recently
left the company and joined another that advises clients with
real-estate problems.
   Although the Nashville syndicators gathered investment
money nationwide, they drew disproportionately from local
doctors, lawyers and accountants. Many lost $20,000 to
$50,000. The signs of these losses still linger.
   Charitable gifts are down. The Cumberland Girl Scouts are
having trouble in their annual fund-raising. "That never
would have happened in normal circumstances," says Edwin
Moats, chairman of Metropolitan Federal and a member of the
scouts' board. His own S&amp;L, with $140 million in foreclosed
property and problem loans, has halved its donations.
   And although Nashville's overall economy is far from
disaster, some businesses besides real estate look a bit
shaky. Local auto sales are off, for example, and several
Nashville dealers passed up the chance to set up a dealership
for the Infiniti, Nissan's luxury car.
   Many Nashvillians believe that the bank examiners are
making a manageable problem worse. They think federal
regulators overreacted and scared banks into withdrawing or
withholding credit from real-estate developers.
   "It has had a chilling effect," says Ken Larish, developer
of one of Nashville's premier suburban office parks, the
400-acre Maryland Farms. "Banks have terminated lending to
people like us." Mr. Larish says his company, helped by its
ownership of the undeveloped land, will survive, though it
probably will need additional equity investment.
   But other developers have quit speculative work
completely. Third National Bank recently did a "friendly
foreclosure" on a 40-acre tract owned by Smiley &amp; Atchison
Investments. With a $6 million loan, the developer had bought
the open land to prepare it for speculative projects. David
Atchison, its chief executive, says the company will get out
of the business.
   Even though office-vacancy rates are only a bit above the
national average -- about 18% downtown and 23% in the suburbs
-- that is plenty high, and office rents are under pressure.
Building owners are finding it harder to pay off loans. In
1989 foreclosures began to snowball, and today nearly every
senior banker and every substantial developer in town spends
much of his time in painful conversations about a
foreclosure.
   The upshot is that hundreds of millions of dollars of
Nashville real estate is beginning to churn through the
banks. The looming problem: no buyers. "One thing about this
downswing, the opportunists aren't there," says Thomas Frye,
Third National's first vice president for commercial real
estate. The banks will probably have difficulty selling off
the properties. They have turned into real-estate owners,
with all the managerial headaches that entails.
   Predictably, in this nervous atmosphere, bankers are
afraid to lend. Entrepreneurs outside of the real-estate
fields notice a change in the mood.
   "The entrepreneur is the first to get slammed," says
Barney Byrd, who runs a leveraged-buy-out fund called Gen Cap
America that, in the past 18 months, acquired three small
Tennessee companies, each in roughly the $10 million range.
   But Mr. Byrd's most recent attempt to raise money fell
through. He thought he had a loan all sewed up from an
Atlanta outpost of Maryland National Bank, but the bank
called to say the loan office in Atlanta is closing down.
More or less giving up on finding bank loans in Nashville,
Mr. Byrd has turned to out-of-town financial houses, such as
Heller International.
   For untested entrepreneurs, getting a loan here is almost
impossible. And if the entrepreneur is a 30-year-old with no
credit history, forget it. That's what Joe Haze learned in
trying to buy Minuteman Press, a franchised printer here,
from his boss.
   Under the previous management, the Minuteman shop wasn't
aggressive about collecting debts, Mr. Haze says. It also was
late in paying its own bills; for example, it owes $5,000 to
its paper supplier.
   All told, Mr. Haze needs a $20,000 loan to get the shop
back on its feet. First American National Bank had lent
$10,000 to the previous owner but won't consider a loan to
Mr. Haze because he doesn't own a house or have credit cards.
   The young businessman has turned to a New Jersey loan
broker for help. In return for a $500 up-front fee, the
broker promised to help Mr. Haze find money. But the loan
never materialized, and the loan broker's phone has been
disconnected.
