   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge dismissed Charles Keating's
challenge to the government takeover of Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan Association, saying that the Arizona executive and his
associates engaged in "skullduggery" to loot Lincoln of tens
of millions of dollars.
   Judge Stanley Sporkin's decision was a major victory for
the government and marked the first court test of federal
regulators' contentions that Mr. Keating wove elaborate
business schemes to transfer funds from Lincoln to its parent
company, American Continental Corp. The parent in turn paid
multimillion-dollar salaries to Mr. Keating, who is its
chairman, and other officials. The government has said the
failure of Lincoln, one of the biggest thrift debacles ever,
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.

   In a scathing 50-page decision, Judge Sporkin rejected Mr.
Keating's contention that overzealous and incompetent
government regulators harassed him for five years after he
bought Lincoln in 1984, and acted illegally in seizing the
thrift in April 1989.
   "It is abundantly clear that ACC's officials abused their
positions with respect to Lincoln," Judge Sporkin wrote,
adding: "Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to a
looting of Lincoln. This was not done crudely. Indeed, it was
done with a great deal of sophistication."
   Government officials said that yesterday's clear victory
could help in a civil fraud suit the government has filed
seeking $1.1 billion from Mr. Keating and other Lincoln
executives. Some proceedings in that suit have been delayed
by the action before Judge Sporkin. "I think the ring is
closing around Mr. Keating," said William Seidman, chairman
of the Resolution Trust Corp., which filed the civil suit.
The Office of Thrift Supervision also has filed
administrative charges against Mr. Keating and five other
officials, seeking $40.9 million.
   Mr. Keating sued the government last year, contending that
the regulators had a vendetta against him for making risky
real estate and junk-bond investments outside the pale of the
traditional home mortgages held by thrifts. Judge Sporkin
brushed those claims aside and said that in a series of real
estate and securities transactions, American Continental's
actions in bleeding Lincoln of funds was like "an adult
taking candy from a helpless child."
   The decision came on a motion by the government to dismiss
the suit. Beginning in December, Judge Sporkin held more than
30 days of hearings, examining several of Lincoln's
transactions.
   In a statement yesterday in response to the decision,
American Continental said it was "reviewing all of its
options" and had "no comment at this time."
   In June, on the last day of the hearings, Mr. Keating said
he expected to appeal if the decision went against him.
However, perhaps heartened by Judge Sporkin's relentless
questioning of government witnesses during the proceedings,
he said: "I have full confidence that what this judge does
will be a fair and honest opinion, based on everything that
he's done. I realize I may be hanging myself with that
comment, but I believe that."
   Judge Sporkin, a former enforcement director at the
Securities and Exchange Commission known for his
outspokenness, had harsh words for Lincoln's accountants, in
particular Arthur Young &amp; Co., and attorneys who signed off
on complicated deals that he said had no "economic
substance." The judge said: "The system of accounting that
exists in the United States is in a sorry state" if Lincoln's
accountants were correct in approving the accounting of
certain deals.
   However, Judge Sporkin also praised one Arthur Young
accountant, Janice Vincent, for refusing to allow Lincoln to
record a profit, which Mr. Keating was "desperate" for, in a
complicated securities transaction. Arthur Young is now part
of Ernst &amp; Young.
   A spokesman for Ernst &amp; Young had no immediate comment
yesterday. When Arthur Young's actions were criticized in
congressional hearings last year, representatives of the firm
said their audits were "responsibly and professionally done."
   In one transaction in March 1987, for instance, Judge
Sporkin found that Lincoln provided $14 million in financing
to sell 1,000 acres it owned outside Phoenix, Ariz., though
Lincoln knew the buyer couldn't repay the debt "in any
realistic time frame." But because the book value of the land
was $3 million, Lincoln was able to record a gain of $11
million and $250,000 in accrued interest.
