   NEW YORK -- Halsey Drug Co. said its directors authorized
the purchase of 250,000 of the generic drug company's 5.6
million shares outstanding.
   The company said management decided on the buy-back
because it considered the stock undervalued. A spokesman said
the purchase wasn't meant as an anti-takeover device.

shares closed yesterday at $3.0625, down 25 cents, in
American Stock Exchange composite trading.
