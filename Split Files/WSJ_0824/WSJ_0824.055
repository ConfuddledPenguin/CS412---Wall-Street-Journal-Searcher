   JERUSALEM -- Jordanian military officers have been
training Iraqi troops to operate U.S.-made Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles captured from Kuwait, government military sources
here say.
   Because of the training, U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf
may be forced to fight against Hawks and other advanced
U.S.-made weaponry, which Israeli experts believe the Iraqi
troops would have been unable to operate without assistance.
Both the radar tracking system and the method for reloading
the Hawk missile are considered too complex to master without
instruction.

   Omar Rifai, first secretary of the Jordanian Embassy in
Washington denied that his country is training Iraqis to use
the anti-aircraft missiles. "There's no truth to these
reports," he said. "They're completely unfounded."
   Despite the politically charged situation in the Gulf, the
Jordanians -- who have been calling for a peaceful,
negotiated settlement -- have taught the Iraqi officers how
to use the Hawks "on an ongoing basis," an Israeli military
source said yesterday. "So now," he said, "U.S. troops will
have to face their own U.S.-made weapons, captured by the
Iraqis in Kuwait."
   Israeli officials are anxious to point out the risks of
U.S. weaponry falling into unfriendly hands right now, since
they are trying to make a case against the U.S.'s plans to
supply Saudi Arabia with its most sophisticated fighter
planes.
   "Too many times it seems that when the Americans give or
sell an ally weapons, they fall into the hands of a U.S.
enemy," commented Gerald Steinberg, a military analyst at
Israel's Bar Ilan University. "It happened with the fall of
the shah in Iran in 1979, with Vietnam in 1975, and now
here."
   A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on the reports.
   In return for the training, Iraq has given Jordan
Western-made spare military parts -- also captured from
Kuwait -- for which Iraq has no use, Israeli military sources
believe.
   Joseph Alpher, deputy head of the Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, said yesterday that
since 1977 the U.S. had supplied Kuwait a total of four
batteries of MIM 23B Improved Hawk ground-to-air
anti-aircraft missiles. Each battery contains three or four
mobile launchers, which means that if the Iraqi army captured
all of them, it would now have the ability to fire 12 to 16
Hawk missiles at a time. While the Hawks were new to the
Iraqis, Jordan already had at least 14 batteries of the same
kind of Hawks, Mr. Alpher said. Jordan got its first Hawks
from the U.S. in 1976.
   In addition to the Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, Kuwait
also had in its arsenal 30 U.S.-made Skyhawk bombers, an
unknown number of U.S.-made air-to-air Sidewinder missiles,
and 500 armored personnel carriers, many of them U.S.-made
M113s. Along with these sophisticated U.S. weapons, Kuwait
had Soviet hand-held missiles; French Exocet, Magique, Matra
and HOT missiles; 30 French Mirage F-1 planes; and a number
of other Soviet- and Egyptian-made weapons.
   Although Jordan and Iraq have developed close military
ties over the past year and a half, Mr. Steinberg commented
that "Jordan's training Iraq how to use the Hawks adds a new
dimension" to the relationship at a particularly delicate
moment.
   But he noted that because the cooperative ties between the
two countries already existed, "the infrastructure was
already there. An institutional momentum had already begun.
It would have been a political decision for Jordan to stop"
the cooperation at this point, Mr. Steinberg said.
   Israeli military sources were unsure when the Jordanians
began advising the Iraqis on using Hawk missiles, but they
say it is possible that the training had been going on for
some time, using Amman's supply of missiles, before Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. In any event, the Israeli sources
assume the training is continuing.
   With Iraq's Saddam Hussein wildly popular among the 60% of
Jordan's population who are Palestinian, Jordan's King
Hussein has been trying to walk a political tightrope between
Iraq and his longstanding alliance with the U.S. Israeli
experts believe he may have felt too politically threatened
at home to turn down Saddam Hussein's request for continued
military training.
   Jordan began to escalate its military cooperation with
Iraq about a year and a half ago, Israeli experts believe.
Too economically strapped to pay for all its own training,
Jordan began to join forces with Iraq. The two countries
began to conduct joint overflights near the Israeli border,
and also to conduct joint ground maneuvers. And a large
number of senior Iraqi field commanders reconnoitered the
Israel-Jordan border. The Iraqis and Jordanians currently are
operating radar in Jordan aimed at Israel, said an Israeli
intelligence expert on Iraq.
   "Given this level of cooperation," said Mr. Alpher, "it's
not surprising that the Jordanians would provide the Hawk
training."
