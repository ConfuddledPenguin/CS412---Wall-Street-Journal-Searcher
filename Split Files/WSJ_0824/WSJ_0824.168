   The over-the-counter stock market ended the day as it
began: falling into sandy uncertainty.
   Yesterday's 14.62 point loss brought the Nasdaq Composite
Index to a level it hadn't seen since May 1988.

   One trader suggests the sell-off has become so prolonged
and so pronounced that investors are selling at the closing
bell in anticipation of lower prices at the next day's
opening bell.
   Whatever the reason, traders' frustration at the absence
of supporting price levels or positive developments to rally
the market has become evident.
   "We're in very dangerous territory. Who knows how and
where it's going to stop," says Philip Benizzi, head of OTC
trading for Dillion Read &amp; Co.
   And Leslie Seff, director of OTC trading for Gruntal &amp;
Co., says the best advice for now is to be on the sidelines
while the world squares off against Iraq.
   "I see little change in direction until a positive change
occurs in world affairs," Mr. Seff says.
   While the Nasdaq Composite Index was dropping 3.9% to
360.22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was falling 3% to
2483.42, its first close below 2500 since July 1989. The New
York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 3.1%.
   The OTC market started the day 2% lower at the opening and
3.5% lower an hour later. By midday, unlisted stocks were
recovering, only to retreat quickly in the final 30 minutes.
   This war-wary market seems to have abandoned old
priorities, says Barry Berman, head of equity trading for
Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.
   "Economic news, technical support levels just haven't made
any difference," Mr. Berman says.
   The OTC's fifth straight loss was a broad one. Only 320
issues advanced on the day while 2,163 declined.
   Volume jumped to 202.8 million shares from Wednesday's
146.1 million shares.
   On the brighter side of a bleak OTC market, Dillon Read's
Mr. Benizzi reports some of the added volume yesterday was
institutions selectively returning to the buy side of the
market.
   Mr. Benizzi says corporations buying back their own issues
and other institutions shopping for a particular bargain
helped bring up some prices.
   Intel benefitted from buy-back news and bargain hunting.
   Twenty points below its 52-week high, Intel announced its
intent to repurchase up to 20 million of its 204 million
common shares. Intel shares got a 1 1/8 point boost to 33
1/4. Its volume of 4.5 million shares topped the OTC
most-active list.
   Shorewood Packaging was 3 1/4 lower to 7 3/4 after
predicting late Wednesday that its first quarter earnings
would be about 30% below the 30 cents a share it earned in
the quarter a year ago. More than 2.6 million Shorewood
shares changed hands, nearly 12 times its daily average
volume.
   Among active stocks: MCI Communications was down 1 1/4 at
31 3/4; Oracle Systems fell 5/8 to 12 3/4; Apple Computer
lost 5/8 to 34 1/3; Nike closed 2 lower at 60; and Amgen was
1 3/8 lower at 41 3/8.
   McCaw Cellular Communications' debt problems were
highlighted in yesterday's "Heard on the Street Column" in
this newspaper. The column reported McCaw's $4 billion of
debt has inspired a strong bearish sentiment about its stock.
McCaw shares lost 2 to 15 3/4.
   Elmwood Federal Savings Bank regained some lost ground,
adding 1 to 7 1/2. Elmwood lost half of its value Wednesday
when Susquehanna Bancshares terminated its agreement to
purchase Elmwood. Susquehanna shares fell 3/4 yesterday to
close at 17.
   Flagship Financial estimated it would charge $13 million
against earnings in the third quarter for costs associated
with the closing of five First American Savings retail units
in New Jersey. Flagship Financial shares dropped 1 1/2 to 7
1/2.
