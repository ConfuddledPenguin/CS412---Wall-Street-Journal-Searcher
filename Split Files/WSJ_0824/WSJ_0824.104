   TORONTO -- Noranda Inc. named its president, David Kerr,
to the additional position of chief executive officer,
succeeding Alfred Powis, who remains chairman.
   Mr. Powis, 59 years old, said the executive change was
made last month, but wasn't made public at the time because
"it's not regarded by the board or anybody else as being a
big deal. I don't think it will change anything
particularly."

   An internal notice about the change had been circulated to
the staff of Noranda, which is a diversified resource
concern.
   Mr. Powis said the executive change was initiated by
Noranda's major shareholder, Brascan Ltd., a holding company
controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. Mr. Powis said the
move is consistent with changes taking place throughout the
Bronfman group of companies to make the chairmen
non-executive officers.
   Mr. Powis, who served as chief executive at Noranda for 22
years, said that as chairman, he will continue to focus on
long-term strategic issues. He said Mr. Kerr will continue to
look after the company's day-to-day operations.
   Mr. Kerr, 46, has served as Noranda president since 1987.
He previously served in executive positions at Brascan and
other Bronfman group companies.
