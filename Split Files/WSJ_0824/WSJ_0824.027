   DETROIT -- Anyone who dreams of tooling along America's
roads in a slick Ferrari Daytona Spyder needs two things:
money and patience. The now-discontinued car fetches roughly
$1 million, and there's often a lengthy wait to get a used
one.
   But buyers who settle for a California Daytona Spyder have
no wait and pay only about $50,000. The California Spyder is
a "kit car," a life-size replica that independent
manufacturers make from the parts of cheaper cars. The
California Spyder looks so much like the Daytona Spyder it
was used on television's "Miami Vice." It's also so close to
the original version that Ferrari S.p.A. sued its builder for
trademark infringement -- and won.

   The $300 million kit-car industry has been on edge since
that July 1989 ruling by a federal judge in California, and
with good reason. Other luxury car makers are joining Ferrari
in claiming that kit-car makers are cheating them by
reproducing their cars and selling them at cut-rate prices.
   The auto companies claim the kit-car makers are infringing
on their trademarks, because their designs are easily
recognized and considered unique. "We don't want a
Chevy-powered Lamborghini on the road," says Robert F. Smith,
business development executive for the U.S. sales arm of
Lamborghini S.p.A. "We're trying to protect our reputation."
   That wasn't much of a concern until the last year or two.
Most kit-cars (so-called because consumers can buy them in
kits to build at home, though most buy them already
assembled) didn't look too much like the originals. But many
kit makers have improved their manufacturing processes.
They've stepped up advertising and gotten exposure on
television shows. Industrywide sales figures don't exist, but
auto makers now see kit makers as more of a threat than in
the past.
   Ferrari has sued two U.S. kit makers in recent years, and
won each time. Because of that, other auto makers are finding
that merely threatening to sue kit makers for replicating
rare, expensive cars is enough. "The {kit-car} industry may
be forced to go back and do business a different way,"
contends George Evans, president of the Association of
Handcrafted Automobiles.
   That is precisely what the auto makers want. Lamborghini,
for example, finds companies that replicate its cars by
watching ads in kit-car magazines, and asks them to quit. So
far, Lamborghini says, its lawyers have sent letters to at
least three auto-replica companies, and all have ended
production. "It's like copying the Mona Lisa," asserts Mr.
Smith. "You can't imagine Da Vinci would be happy about it."
   But kit makers say you can't liken a Lamborghini Countach
to the Mona Lisa. They claim they're being bullied by large
auto companies who've got the money and the manpower to
outmuscle them.
   "At first I said I was going to fight," says California
kit maker Jim Kuzara, who stopped replicating the Countach
after he was contacted by Lamborghini. "But then logic
started to take over." Mr. Kuzara says he couldn't afford a
lengthy court battle, even though losing the Countach replica
would devastate his small business. The bread-and-butter
model had accounted for 80% of his company's sales.
   Lamborghini and Ferrari are the most aggressive in
attacking the kit makers, but they aren't alone. Rolls Royce
Motor Cars has taken two duplicators to court since the
1970s, and won both cases on the grounds of trademark
infringement. "If you try to doctor something up to look like
a Rolls we find it offensive," says spokesman Reg Abbiss.
   Ford Motor Co.'s Jaguar PLC unit, Porsche AG and
Daimler-Benz AG are likewise vigilant, threatening to sue kit
makers whose replicas hit too close to home. "We're very
strict with our trademark," asserts a spokesman for
Daimler-Benz, which makes Mercedes-Benz cars.
   But kit-car makers say they don't understand all the fuss.
"The cars are similar and we don't deny that," says Carl
Roberts, a Tennessee kit-car builder. "But you can't stop
people from making something that is similar to something
else."
   But the courts are doing just that. Earlier this year Mr.
Roberts was ordered to stop selling replicas of Spyder and
Testarossa models, both made by Ferrari.
   Sales of the look-alikes, which were built using the body
and engine of Chevrolet Corvettes, represented about 80% of
Mr. Roberts's cash flow. Mr. Roberts says he had to
temporarily shut down after the ruling, and now builds stunt
cars for movie makers, though they aren't nearly as
profitable as the Ferrari copycats had been. "They make it
difficult for a small businessman to survive," says Mr.
Roberts, who is appealing the court case that he lost.
   But auto companies say they have little sympathy for kit
makers. "The replicas dilute our good reputation," says Hugh
Steward, a spokesman for Ferrari. "Individuals who invest
large amounts of money in real Ferraris are upset when there
are cheap imitations on the road."
