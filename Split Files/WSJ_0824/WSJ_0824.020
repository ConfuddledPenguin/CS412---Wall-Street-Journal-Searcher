   New York -- Among the herd of poets, choreographers,
scientists and scholars nominated for so-called MacArthur
"genius" awards this year, one name stood out. "When the
committee saw a paper file on a man named Michael Moschen who
was a juggler, eyebrows were raised," said Kenneth W. Hope.
Mr. Hope oversees the Fellows Program of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which recently presented
36 "exceptionally gifted individuals" with cash awards
ranging from $150,000 to $375,000.
   Mr. Moschen is the first MacArthur juggler, a fact that
still seems to bemuse Mr. Hope. "Juggling," he said, "while
it's a very ancient and traditional art form, is not
something one thinks of when one thinks of creativity."

   But Mr. Moschen, a wiry 35-year-old with thinning curly
hair and a surname made to delight waggish copywriters, is
not your traditional juggler. You won't see any bowling pins
in his act, and he doesn't juggle lit torches (he prefers to
spin his, a rhythmic gymnastics technique). And while some
jugglers may start off with four balls and add on seven
oranges, a bicycle wheel and an umbrella, Mr. Moschen is more
likely to start with four balls and end up with just one. His
Zen approach to juggling makes the business of tossing
objects in the air and catching them look like a whole new
ball game.
   "For me, a juggler is very simply about control -- but a
control to protect us against what?" Mr. Moschen paused.
"Chaos."
   On stage, he creates the illusion of a geometrically
ordered universe in which balls, hoops, tetrahedrons and
other shapes seem to propel themselves through space. Four
crystal balls revolving on the floor suddenly lift themselves
into Mr. Moschen's hands and form a swirling chain. A single
metal ring wafts before him, then sweeps through the air
making slinky-like patterns of light; a pliant, rubbery hoop
melts into one Daliesque shape after another as it turns in
his hands.
   However esoteric the philosophy behind Mr. Moschen's
performances, the effect on audiences is mesmerizing. The
crowd of cellular-phone-equipped Manhattanites that came to
see him perform recently at Lincoln Center's "Serious Fun]"
festival gawped like kids at the circus. Apparently, one look
at a videotape of Mr. Moschen's act had MacArthur committee
members doing the same -- they voted to award him $230,000
over the next five years.
   The award came just in time for Mr. Moschen, whose checks
were about to bounce even faster than his rubber balls.
   "I was not going to be able to hold out much longer within
the arts and pay the bills and do the work I needed to do
unless something gave," he said, leaning back on a desk chair
in the crowded Bowery loft he shares with his wife, Danielle
Mailer, a painter and graphic designer, and their
14-month-old daughter, Isabella. Most of the available space
is taken up by the long carpeted platform where he has
developed his routines before a wall-length mirror since
1977.
   A teenage jock from Greenfield, Mass., Mr. Moschen was
more interested in football and basketball than juggling,
which he learned at the age of 12. But after being hit so
hard playing football that he briefly lost his memory, he
began juggling in earnest.
   By the age of 19, Mr. Moschen and boyhood friend Penn
Jillette, now of Penn and Teller fame, were tossing clubs six
times a day, six days a week, at New Jersey's Great Adventure
amusement park. College didn't interest him: "I very early
dropped out of the normal routes of higher education because
it wasn't teaching me how to teach myself," he explained.
   In 1981, after stints as a street performer, a juggler
with the Big Apple Circus and a dancer/juggler with Lotte
Goslar's Pantomime Circus, Mr. Moschen struck out on his own.
Dissatisfied with circus-style juggling, he was looking for a
new way to develop his craft when he spied a crystal ball in
an antique shop.
   "I was trying to figure out how to work with absolute
simplicity," he said. "I didn't know if a juggler could work
with just one small thing and make it interesting."
   "Crystals," which Mr. Moschen performed at Lincoln Center,
dressed only in a loin cloth, began with the juggler on the
ground, curled over a clicking circle of clear balls. Cupping
the spinning balls in his hands, he slowly released one after
another till a single crystal revolved in his palm, flipped
over and under it and glided over his hands and arms as
though animated by an energy of its own.
   To create such arresting images, Mr. Moschen will spend
months, even years, experimenting with an object or shape.
Like a sculptor, he makes drawings, photo studies and models.
While deep in his circle phase on a stay in Cape Cod, for
example, he attached a metal ring to a pole and then stuck it
in the sand at low tide. When the tide came in, the ring
seemed to float above the waves, an image he determined to
re-create in performance.
   Inspiration often comes from unlikely places. Take Mr.
Moschen's triangle piece, in which he bounces three balls off
the sides of a tall pyramid in rapid-fire rhythms that change
as much as 20 times.
   "I became fascinated with the wedges you put under a door
to stop it," he said.
   Over the next year, he experimented with small hollow
wedges before building a big one with the help of set
designer John Kahn, a frequent collaborator. Soon Mr. Moschen
was spending the better part of his 12-hour workday inside
the triangle.
   "I would lie down in it, roll balls while I was lying down
in it, do handstands in it -- I'd climb on top of it," Mr.
Moschen said. "For a year and a half I lived inside the
triangle to make it mine. Sometimes I'd go to sleep inside
the triangle because you can't know it well enough."
   Mr. Moschen performs such routines with a physical grace
and precision that sometimes seems closer to dance than
juggling. But while he may be the only juggler to work with a
choreographer and receive choreography grants, he resists the
label.
   "Dancers and choreographers have used objects, but always
I felt they were separate from them," Mr. Moschen said. "You
can't really separate me from what I'm doing if I'm doing it
well."
   Viewers will have a chance to check out Mr. Moschen's act
for themselves next spring, when a broadcast of his work will
air on PBS's "Great Performances" series. In the meantime, he
intends to explore the role of the juggler "as architect."
He's been experimenting with columns, cones, and even his
wife's drawing table. So far, there isn't a bowling pin in
sight.
