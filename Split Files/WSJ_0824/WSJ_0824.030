   CURTISS-WRIGHT Corp. declared a third-quarter dividend of
25 cents a share, payable Oct. 31 to stock of record Oct. 17.
The dividend, a reduction from first- and second-quarter
dividends of 40 cents a share, follows a special cash
dividend of $30 a share, or $150.5 million, paid Aug. 15. A
spokesman said he assumes the company will continue to pay 25
cents quarterly. Based in Lyndhurst, N.J., Curtiss-Wright
produces precision products and provides engineering
services.
