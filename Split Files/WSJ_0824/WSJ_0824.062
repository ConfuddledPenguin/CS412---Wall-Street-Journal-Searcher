   NEW YORK -- Awash in arbitration cases, Wall Street is
hoping to create a single forum in which small investors can
settle disputes with their brokers.
   The idea, which would consolidate the nation's 10
stock-market arbitration panels, is in its infancy. Few
details have been worked out. And with some regulators and
stock exchange officials expressing reservations about a
stand-alone arbitration body, the plan might never fly.

   But the Street is certainly eager to corral its
arbitration caseload, which has doubled since 1986 to an
estimated 5,500 cases filed last year. Some brokerage
executives envision the new forum as a step toward banishing
a widely held perception that arbitration is stacked against
small investors.
   "The old-boy network, which may exist in certain places,
should not be as prevalent" with a single forum, said David
E. Robbins, a New York lawyer specializing in arbitration and
a former arbitration director at the American Stock Exchange.
   "But there really would be no change in perception," Mr.
Robbins said. A single forum, he said, "still would be
subsidized by the securities industry."
   Talk of such a forum has been around for years, and
recently has picked up steam. The Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration, an ad hoc group that proposes
arbitration rules, will pick a consultant from among four
final bidders on Sept. 5 to come up with a firm plan and
study the feasibility. Officials of the National Association
of Securities Dealers are pushing for a quick proposal,
because the NASD shoulders by far the biggest slice of all
arbitration cases.
   Investors typically sign a standard agreement when they
open a brokerage account, binding them to accept arbitration
rather than file a lawsuit if a dispute arises. Investors can
bring cases against brokers to any of the 10 panels sponsored
by the securities industry. But the NASD and the New York
Stock Exchange handle 92% of all filings.
   A single forum wouldn't necessarily be a boon to small
investors. Fees for filing cases could jump because of the
costs of new facilities and computer systems, analysts said.
And any new arbitration body could be starved for resources,
because it wouldn't have the benefit of other exchange
business, facilities or personnel.
   Besides, Richard P. Ryder, editor of the Securities
Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter, said,
"Competition holds down prices a little better than
monopolies."
   One way investors stand to benefit: A single agency would
eliminate the subtle differences among various stock market
forums and their arbitrators. Some plaintiffs' lawyers
criticize the Big Board, for example, because they say its
arbitrators appear to be more biased toward the securities
industry -- a charge about which the the Big Board won't
comment.
   The New York exchange has reservations about a single
forum. "There are no means of registering it, no means of
funding it, no means of governing it," James E. Buck, a Big
Board senior vice president, said. The Big Board nevertheless
will participate in the study before judging the plan, he
said.
   The NASD is the plan's biggest backer, for good reason.
Even though many investor complaints don't involve securities
traded on its own system, the NASD winds up handling
two-thirds of all arbitration cases. (Many arbitration
agreements limit investors' choice of a forum to the NASD,
where investors last year won 54% of their cases, or to the
Big Board, where investors won about half the time.)
   Deborah Masucci, the NASD's director of arbitration,
characterized a single forum as "a more economic and
efficient way to handle disputes." Of course, she said, "We
have a vested interest."
   The Securities Industry Association has encouraged
discussion of the forum. "In theory, it sounds good, and
there should be economies of scale," William Fitzpatrick, the
trade group's general counsel and a member of the Securities
Industry Conference on Arbitration, said. The big concern is
funding. Unless a stand-alone forum is launched, the NASD and
others now shouldering the cost burden may eventually pull
back from the arbitration process, some specialists warned.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it wants to
see a proposal before commenting on the plan. A few SEC
staffers worry that the new operation might have trouble
keeping high-quality arbitrators, because a stand-alone
organization is likely to be strapped for cash.
   Backers of the plan said it is gaining momentum. "Just the
fact that a panel is studying it means the sphinx has moved
an inch," Constantine N. Katsoris, professor of law at
Fordham University School of Law, said.
