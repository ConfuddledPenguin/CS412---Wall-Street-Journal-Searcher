   With long-term government bonds now yielding over 9%, is
this the time for individual investors to start buying?
   Not yet, say several investment advisers.

   Even though government-guaranteed returns of more than 9%
may look tempting, these money managers say shorter-term
investments are a safer bet, at least for the next few weeks.
That is especially true, they say, because of the crisis in
the Middle East.
   "I think interest rates are going higher here and around
the world, so this is a good time to keep money in
short-term, liquid investments," says Jeffrey A. Poxon, chief
investment officer at Lafayette Life Insurance Co. in
Lafayette, Ind. "We've got our helmets and flak jackets on."
   Betting on long-term bonds right now "is very dangerous,"
agrees James M. Benham, chairman of the Benham Capital
Management Group of mutual funds in Mountain View, Calif.
"It's just too big a gamble to buy long bonds right now and
bet that this is the high we'll see in rates."
   Since Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait, soaring oil prices
have jolted stock and bond markets around the world. In the
U.S., yields on long-term bonds have jumped three-quarters of
a percentage point this month alone. For example, 30-year
Treasury bonds late yesterday yielded about 9.1%, up from
8.35% on Aug. 1, just before the Iraqi invasion. But some
forecasters say even higher yields lie ahead.
   "I think it would be premature to regard bonds as a good
investment right now," says Robert M. Giordano, a partner at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and the firm's director of economic
research. "They probably are a bad speculation now because
the inflation picture is deteriorating and continued upward
pressure on yields is likely."
   Mr. Giordano sees "a real risk" that bond yields could
jump to the 9 1/2% to 10% area in the next few months. At
those levels, he says, long-term bonds "would probably be a
pretty good investment."
   Some money managers say bonds already represent good
value. They say the economy may already have fallen into a
recession, that higher oil prices will make the slump even
more severe and that investor fears about inflation will
again prove to be exaggerated.
   Thirty-year Treasury bonds now look "very attractive" over
a long-term horizon, says Robert S. Dow, a partner at Lord,
Abbett &amp; Co. and head of its fixed-income division. "I'm not
saying people should leverage themselves to the hilt and go
long, but too many people have too much money sitting in bank
CDs or commercial paper or money-market funds."
   Money managers who are bearish on bonds reply that
safety-conscious individual investors can earn nearly the
same yields, with much less price volatility, on shorter-term
bonds as on long-term issues. For example, Treasury notes due
in two years now yield about 8 1/4%. Five-year notes yield
8.66%, or 0.44 percentage point less than 30-year bonds.
   For institutional investors with large amounts of money to
manage, that gap is significant. But for investors looking
for a safe place to park $10,000, the difference in interest
income works out to only $44.00 a year.
   Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from
yields, have plummeted over the past few weeks. "It's been a
very rough month, one of the worst ever," says Virginia M.
Henneberry, first vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc.
   Investors who made the mistake of buying long-term
government bonds at the start of the month would already have
seen the resale value of their bonds plunge by about 6%. The
Treasury bond market's slump since Aug. 1 is the most severe
since May 1986, when prices fell 6.53%, Ms. Henneberry says.
The worst month was October 1979, when interest rates soared
and long-term Treasury bond prices nosedived 8.74%.
   Several economists contend investors should wait to buy
long-term bonds until after a recession has clearly begun.
Interest rates, they say, typically continue rising in the
early stages of a recession. One explanation is that
inflation pressures usually don't ease until after a business
slump is well under way, says Mr. Giordano of Goldman Sachs.
   One obvious problem with trying to use the onset of
recession to time bond-market investments is that it is
difficult, if not impossible to know if a recession is indeed
under way. When investors say not to buy bonds until after a
recession begins, "they're always looking back with perfect
20-20 hindsight, knowing exactly when the recession began,"
says Mr. Dow of Lord Abbett.
   Still, other money managers contend that pressures for
higher interest rates abroad probably will continue to
depress U.S. bond prices. Higher rates overseas, they say,
could make dollar-denominated investments look even less
attractive to investors in other countries, at least in
coming weeks.
   `I think rates are poised to go higher in both Germany and
Japan," says Mr. Benham of Benham Capital. "That would widen
the gap between their rates and ours and make it even more
difficult" for U.S. bond prices to recover. However, he says
higher interest rates both here and abroad eventually will
slow world-wide economic growth, paving the way for another
bull market in bonds.
   "Until investors see where, when and how events in the
Middle East unfold," says Mr. Poxon of Lafayette Life, "I'm
afraid interest rates are going to head upward because of the
inflationary impact of the price of oil."
