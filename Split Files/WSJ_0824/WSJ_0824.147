criminal violations of California's air pollution laws and

   The charges arose from inspections in April and May of a
Los Angeles facility the company uses for aircraft painting
and stripping operations. The airline was charged with
failure to obtain proper permits and with improper handling
of various hazardous chemicals and a known carcinogen, the
office said.
