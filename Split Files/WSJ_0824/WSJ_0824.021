   TOKYO -- A rise in the price of oil to $40 a barrel could
shave $20 billion a year off Japan's trade surplus, the Tokai
Bank Ltd. reported.
   Oil prices have climbed sharply since Iraq invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2, with the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate
oil for October delivery rising above $30 in Tokyo yesterday.

   The latest statistics show that rising oil prices could
trigger higher interest rates, lowering Japan's real economic
growth by 0.8 percentage point.
   The impact of higher oil on Japan's economy will be
relatively light, compared with the blows Japan suffered in
the two oil crises of the 1970s, a bank official said.
