   Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. said it expects to report an increase
in 1990 net income.
   David H. Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer,
didn't give an estimate for the year, but said he expects a
continuation of Castle &amp; Cooke's first-half performance. For
the first half, the company's net rose 19%, to $57 million,
or 96 cents a share, on a 15% increase in revenue, to $1.5
billion.

   Last year, the Los Angeles-based company earned $94.9
million, or $1.60 a share, on revenue of $2.7 billion.
   Mr. Murdock, speaking at the company's annual meeting,
also said Castle &amp; Cooke hasn't set a time limit on the
possible sale or spin-off of its Dole Food Co. unit. Castle &amp;
Cooke has said it has been contacted by several major
companies interested in acquiring Dole Food. It has retained
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to help evaluate a possible sale of the
unit.
   Castle &amp; Cooke had first planned to spin off Dole Food
into a new publicly traded company. That plan has been on
hold since May, however, because of financing concerns and
uncertainty over the tax treatment of the transaction.
