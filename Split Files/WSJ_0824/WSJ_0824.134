   NEW YORK -- Stocks plunged again as traders rushed to dump
shares before the close of trading.
   The slide took the Dow Jones Industrial Average below the
2500 level, ending at 2483.42, down 76.73 -- its lowest close
since July 1989.

   Traders say no one wanted to go out of the market holding
stock for fear that some event overnight could shrink values
further.
   The market opened on a downdraft, reacting to a plunge in
share prices overseas. Tokyo stocks plummeted 5.8% Thursday,
the fourth largest one-day point drop in the market's
history. The Dow Jones industrials lost more than 72 points
in the first hour of trading.
   Even the oil stocks fell, with some issues tumbling back
below their levels before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, when oil
was about $20 a barrel. Oil stocks, in the face of rising oil
prices, have been resisting the market sell-off. Crude oil
futures yesterday rose to $31.93.
   Investors couldn't blame program trading for the day's
sell-off.
   Lazslo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, says
there was no evidence of program selling in the final hour of
trading when the industrial average plunged an additional 40
points.
   The New York Stock Exchange's "uptick" rule, which
restricts program trading when the Dow Jones industrials fall
50 points, went into effect at 9:54 a.m. EDT, remaining in
effect for the rest of the trading day.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 9.49 to 307.06,
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 5.34 to
168.88, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index lost 7.79
points to 285.31.
   Only 148 stocks advanced, while 1,645 stocks fell and 242
stocks ended unchanged.
   New York Stock Exchange volume surged to 250,440,000
shares -- bringing the heaviest day of trading since market
players awoke Aug. 2 to the news that Iraq had invaded
Kuwait. Wednesday, 175,550,000 shares were traded.
   Paul Hennessey, vice president of trading at Boston Co.,
said some traders had picked up stocks earlier in the day
hoping for a late session bounce. But when no bounce
materialized, those who held stock rushed to sell before the
close.
   The steep sell-off leaves the market in a position to
rebound early today if there is no bad news overnight, Mr.
Hennessey says. But with the reluctance among traders to hold
stock over the weekend, today's session could prove to be
equally volatile.
   Among the big oil stocks, Exxon gave back 1 3/4 to 49 5/8,
Chevron lost 3 to 75 5/8, Amoco dropped 1 7/8 to 55 3/4 and
Mobil lost 2 3/8 to 62 7/8.
   While analysts continue to consider the energy sector one
of the safest havens within the stock market, they say
investors looking to buy now should pick their stocks with
care.
   Bernard J. Picchi, oil analyst at Salomon Brothers,
cautions that many of the major oil companies have reached
price-earnings valuations well above their peaks during the
last oil-price surge of 1979-1980 when oil reached $40 a
barrel. And many of those companies are now more dependent on
income from their chemical businesses than they were back
then, he says.
   Higher oil prices are likely to squeeze the profits of
petrochemical and plastics operations, Mr. Picchi says, while
a general economic downturn could hurt the markets for those
products in general.
   "In 1980, almost no one {of the major oil companies} was
making money from chemicals, while last year, chemicals
contributed about 16% to the income of the nine largest oil
companies," Mr. Picchi says.
   He is recommending a handful of major oil companies and
refiners that could manage real gains, or will at least fall
less than other stocks.
   Atlantic Richfield and Texaco are Mr. Picchi's picks,
which he says are still cheap relative to other oil stocks
and have less exposure to the chemicals business.
   He also likes refiners Diamond Shamrock, Ashland Oil and
Valero Energy, pointing out that they are likely to benefit
from diminished refining capacity around the world in the
wake of the Middle East turmoil.
   Mr. Picchi estimates that the world has already lost about
1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day of refined products
such as gasoline, kerosene and home-heating oil because of
the embargo against Kuwaiti and Iraqi production.
   Meanwhile, U.S. refineries are operating at about 95% of
their capacity, he says.
   "The bottom line is that we are probably going to see
higher profit margins in refining for a longer period of time
than we would have thought possible before," he says.
   Texaco fell 3 5/8 to 60 1/8, while Atlantic Richfield rose
1/8 to 138 1/2. Diamond Shamrock lost 1/2 to 21 1/4, Ashland
Oil fell 1/2 to 31 1/4, and Valero Energy slipped 3/8 to 15.
   Eli Lilly slid 2 to 68 1/2, leading the most active list
on volume of more than 4.6 million shares. Medtronic said the
U.S. Court of Appeals vacated a lower court finding that
Medtronic infringed patents held by Eli Lilly. Medtronic fell
1 5/8 to 74 5/8.
   Insurance and financial services provider Transamerica
tumbled 3 3/8, or nearly 11%, to 30 on volume of more than
1.8 million shares. The company said it couldn't explain why
its stock has fallen further than the rest of the market. The
company said it still expects to report a strong year.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association lost only 1/8 to
26 5/8 on volume of more than 3.6 million shares. Fannie
Mae's announcement that it will buy back as much as $500
million of its common stock and warrants lent support to its
share price.
   Auto stocks fared better than the rest of the market.
General Motors lost only 3/8 to 36 1/4, Ford fell 1 1/8 to 33
1/8 and Chrysler dropped 1/4 to 12. Sales of U.S.-made cars
were better than expected in mid-August.
   Harken Energy rose 1/4 to 3 3/8. International Rectifier
added 3/8 to 8 3/8. The semiconductor maker reported profit
of 18 cents a share for the fiscal year ended in June,
compared with a loss of $1.13 a share in fiscal 1989. The
company said it expects "double-digit" revenue growth in
1991, with continued improvement in its operating profit.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 8.54
to 315.85. Volume rose to 24,850,000 shares, compared with
16,570,000 shares Wednesday.
