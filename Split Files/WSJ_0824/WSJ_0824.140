   Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. of Japan revised its prediction
of sales for its first half ending Sept. 30 to 274 billion
yen ($1.88 billion) from 268 billion yen, encouraged by
rising nonferrous metal prices and strong demand for
construction materials in recent months.
   As a result, pretax profit in the first half is expected
to reach 14 billion yen, up from the initially predicted 11
billion yen.

fiscal year ending March 31 is expected to rise to 27.5
billion yen from the previously estimated 22 billion yen. A
