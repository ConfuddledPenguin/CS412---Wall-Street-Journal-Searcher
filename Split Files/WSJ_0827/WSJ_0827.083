   Early in 1989, Iraq's defense minister fell out with his
cousin, Saddam Hussein. In May, during a tour of northern
Iraq, his helicopter fell out of the sky.
   In Baghdad, asked about the death of Iraq's leading
military mind, a senior government official responded
defensively: "There was a sandstorm. Ask anyone in the
north."

   Sandstorm or foul play, the rise and fall of Defense
Minister Adnan Khairallah reveals much about the way Saddam
Hussein wields power, and how he protects it. The Iraqi
president sits at the center of a web of power so carefully
spun that a twitch at the periphery triggers a swift and
deadly strike. Around him are only those with whom he has
blood ties -- of relationship, or of shared killings.
   With the defense minister, he had both. Mr. Khairallah's
father was uncle and foster-parent to Saddam Hussein, and his
sister was the wife of the Iraqi president. He also was the
enforcer of almost annual military purges that may have
claimed more senior officers than the eight-year war with
Iran. But Baghdad rumors say that when Saddam Hussein decided
to take a second wife, Mr. Khairallah's rage over the slight
to his sister snapped the family bond. At the same time, the
defense minister, prominent and popular, was emerging as a
potential rival to the president. Being the heir apparent in
Baghdad, says a Jordanian official, "is the most dangerous
job in Iraq."
   Being number one in Baghdad also isn't a job likely to end
with a gold watch and a quiet retirement. The modern history
of Iraq reads like Macbeth, only bloodier. In 1958, soldiers
gunned down King Feisal II while a mob dismembered his prime
minister's corpse and dragged it through the streets. Six
coups and revolts marked the decade between the monarchy's
fall and the Baath Party's final seizure of power. Extensive
purges followed. Since then, Saddam Hussein has survived
dozens of plots.
   Now, those near the top of the Iraqi pyramid either are
generals, carefully kept anonymous and without public
following, or well-known political figures whose fates are so
firmly fused with Saddam Hussein's as to render them impotent
to act against him. "All of them know that if they don't
defend him, they will fall with him, because he has made sure
they have shared in the killings," says Sahib al-Hakim, a
London-based Iraqi dissident. He believes that any Western
dream of a one-bullet solution to the Gulf crisis -- an
internal assassination -- is simplistic. Changing the Iraqi
regime is more like coring an apple -- the whole center may
have to go.
   When Saddam Hussein appears on Iraqi television, the
green-uniformed men standing at his elbow are part of that
center: ministers and members of the Revolutionary Command
Council, Iraq's foremost governing body. Most share the
Saddam Hussein look: middle-aged, military, mustachioed. Most
also share a common past, often beginning in the president's
hometown of Tikrit and passing through the violence, exile
and revolution that brought their Baath Party to power in
1968.
   The Iraqis "are the Prussians of the Arab world," says a
Jordanian who has made high-level visits to Baghdad. When the
Egyptian cabinet meets, he says, it is "very informal, with
everyone shouting their opinions, joking and making fun of
each other." But the tone in Baghdad is that of a military
parade. As ministers enter cabinet meetings, they salute
Saddam Hussein. As they leave, they click their boots and
bow. No one jokes. No one speaks without asking permission,
or unless called upon. "They may speak their mind, but their
mind is always the same as Saddam's," says the Jordanian.
   Years of living dangerously as an assassin and
revolutionary have taught Iraq's leader a thing or two about
watching his own back. Among the lessons:
   -- Eschew routine. When Saddam Hussein, at the age of 22,
tried to assassinate Abdul Karim Qassem, Iraq's leader at the
time, his hit squad had an advantage: It knew the exact route
of the presidential motorcade, thanks to lax security. Now,
the president keeps his schedule unpredictable and his inner
sanctum guarded. When a reporter with this newspaper arrived
for an interview in June, even her ballpoint pen was
carefully examined.
   -- Public trials make heros of your foes. When the Qassem
assassination attempt failed, Iraq put 78 of the plotters on
trial. Their courage and defiance on the stand won new
recruits to the Baathist cause. Now, enemies are dispatched
by summary execution or after swift, closed military
hearings.
   -- Exile and imprisonment don't neutralize enemies. Saddam
Hussein escaped Iraq after the Qassem assassination attempt
and continued plotting from exile in Egypt and, later, from
an Iraqi jail. Now, he quickly answers dissidence. At a 1982
cabinet meeting, the health minister, Riyadh Ibrahim,
suggested Saddam Hussein step down temporarily as a way to
end the war with Iran. The president, according to a
colleague of Mr. Ibrahim, took the health minister into a
side room and shot him. (Iraq said Mr. Ibrahim was executed
because tainted medicine got through to troops.) The same
year, he confirmed for Germany's Stern magazine that Iraq had
recently executed three senior officers. This, he said, was
"something very normal in all wars," because they "did not
undertake their responsibilities" in battle. There have been
reports that officers who refused to take part in the Kuwait
invasion have also been executed.
   -- Don't let a potential successor grab the spotlight.
Between 1968 and 1979, Saddam Hussein was technically number
two in Iraq to Ahmad Hassan Bakr, but he was given plenty of
billing: His portraits frequently hung beside those of the
leader. Mr. Bakr ended up under house arrest. Saddam
Hussein's are the only portraits displayed in Baghdad today.
   Fear isn't the only cement holding Iraq's leadership
together. The men surrounding Saddam Hussein began their
political lives linked by the powerful ideology of
"al-Baath," Arabic for "the Renaissance." Founded in the
1930s by Western-educated intellectuals, Baathism is a
secular, socialist creed devoted to Arab unity. But just as
Marxism in Russia begat the horrors of Stalinism, Baathists
who once espoused parliamentary democracy now rule two of the
Mideast's most repressive states, Iraq and Syria.
   Saddam Hussein also draws a deep personal response from
some Arabs. Those who admire him often use two Arabic terms
to describe their feelings. Saddam Hussein, they say,
represents "nakwa," the ancient Bedouin code of chivalrous
honor by which you starve yourself to feed a friend. He also
inspires "hayba," a mixture of fear and reverence.
   To many Iraqis, the rule of Saddam Hussein has a piercing
historical precedent. In the year 694, Iraq got a governor
named al-Hadjadj who brought stability, prosperity and terror
to the fractious land. Upon assuming power, he assembled the
people and gave the following speech, which Iraqi children
today learn by heart: "I see heads before me that are ripe
and ready for the plucking, and I am the one to pluck them,
and I see blood glistening between the turbans and the
beards. By God, oh people of Iraq, people of discord and
dissembling and evil character] . . . I swear by God that you
will keep strictly to the true path, or I shall punish every
man of you in his body." Legend says the crowd had gathered
rocks to hurl at al-Hadjadj, but the blood-curdling speech
was punctuated by the the plink of stones falling from
frightened fingers.
   The men around Saddam Hussein also probably dropped their
stones a long time ago. And, like him, they watch their
backs. One revolutionary hard-liner accessible to Western
visitors is Latif Jasim, a longtime Revolutionary Command
Council member and the current minister for information and
culture. A visitor to his office learns little of the
substance but much of the style of the Iraqi regime.
   When the elevator door swishes open, visitors find
themselves staring down the barrel of a guard's submachine
gun. A journalist, settling into one of a pair of identical
couches, is swiftly ejected from "the minister's seat." Mr.
Jasim, it seems, has an aversion to sitting with his back to
the door. The information minister arrives armed with a
pistol, but little information. Asked about his career before
1968, he replies: "I was a party member." At university? "Not
necessarily."
   The toughest among the inner circle reputedly is
51-year-old Taha Yassin Ramadan, a one-time bank clerk who
has had a seat on the Revolutionary Command Council since
1969.
   Jamal Sha'ir, a longtime Baath Party official now in
Jordan, describes Mr. Ramadan as the only political figure
with the stature to fill Saddam Hussein's shoes. "He has a
measure of charisma and all the right credentials," says Dr.
Sha'ir. "He is looked on as honest and nationalistic. And he
is certainly brutal." He recalls Mr. Ramadan giving a speech
in Amman, during which Moslem fundamentalists asked about the
Baath Party's attitude toward Islam. Mr. Ramadan responded
that Moslems could pray as much as they liked, "but if they
tried to harm a Baathist regime . . . the regime would break
their necks," Dr. Sha'ir recalls.
   But even the tough knuckle under when the edict comes from
Saddam Hussein. Just before the end of the war, the president
decided that all fat Iraqis should diet. Cabinet ministers
had their actual weights and target weights published in the
press, with exhortations to measure up -- and fast. The
corpulent Mr. Ramadan had to lose more than 60 pounds -- and
he did. "For someone that high up to starve himself says
something about the level of fear and discipline in Iraq,"
says a Jordanian analyst.
   Izzat Ibrahim, Iraq's official number two, is another
tough Tikriti-born revolutionary who demonstrated his
fearlessness of the previous regime by opening a coffee shop
for Baathist plotters. Now in failing health, Mr. Ibrahim has
never been allowed to develop to anything more than a
ceremonial deputy leader. But his daughter is married to one
possible successor, Saddam Hussein's son, Uday.
   Uday is the eldest son of the Iraqi president and his wife
Sajida. While in exile after the 1958 assassination attempt
on Qassem, Saddam Hussein proposed to his cousin Sajida
through a letter to his uncle. Later, imprisoned in Iraq, he
smuggled revolutionary messages to his followers hidden in
Uday's diapers. Until two years ago, his dynastic ambitions
were clear enough: Uday, with only a minor position as head
of a sports federation, was pictured in the newspapers almost
every day.
   But Uday's brutality exceeded even Iraqi bounds. One night
in October 1988, he bludgeoned to death the president's food
taster and bodyguard, Kamal Hana Gegeo, whose father was the
president's chef. The killing, though unpunished, slowed
Uday's fast-track rise to prominence.
   Right now, the rising star is not a son, but a son-in-law.
Hussein Kamel, minister for military industrialization, has
presided over Iraq's rapid and enormous acquisition of
missile technology and conventional weaponry and its
clandestine nuclear program. He also has close ties to the
army and the internal-security forces, forged during
Baghdad's successful campaign to crush Kurdish resistance in
northern Iraq.
   To replace Adnan Khairallah as defense minister, Saddam
Hussein moved to appease an army uneasy about the helicopter
crash. Abdel Jabber Shanshal is a career military man who has
stayed very much in the background.
   To find the regime's least-vicious face it is necessary to
look in the foreign ministry, a center of influence but
little power. Tariq Aziz, the white-haired foreign minister,
is a Christian who never would be accepted to lead Moslem
Iraq.
   A deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's
representative in Washington from 1983 to 1987, may be one of
the most effective envoys in modern diplomatic history. He
arrived just before the U.S. restored long-severed diplomatic
relations with Iraq and crisscrossed the country, speaking at
any public forum that would have him, from trade groups in
Sun Valley, Idaho, to college classes in Santa Cruz, Calif.
In Washington, he cultivated the State Department from desk
officers on upward and invited prominent pro-Israel lobbyists
to embassy dinners.
   The result was a sharp tilt in U.S. policy toward Iraq's
side in the Gulf war and a view of Iraq as a country with
which the U.S. could work.
   Just before the ceasefire with Iran in 1988, Mr. Hamdoon
preached of a post-war Iraq that "desperately needs peace and
security. It can't be a country that looks for troubles." He
wasn't the only official to have such a vision. Sadun
Hammadi, a more senior figure, also talked about an Iraq busy
reviving its economy, seeking "much more cooperation" with
other Arab countries and becoming "much more democratic than
it is now."
   Whether those dreams were genuine or merely bromides for
the West raises interesting questions about the existence of
alternative opinion close to Saddam Hussein. Mr. Hammadi, a
Shiite, is one of the founders of Iraq's Baathist revolution.
While studying business administration at the American
University in Beirut, he recruited travelers to smuggle
Baathist literature into Iraq. Later, studying agricultural
economics at the University of Wisconsin, he absorbed a
commitment to democratic ideals that makes him unique in
Iraq's top echelon.
   But no one from that circle could dream of moving against
Saddam Hussein without the support of the army, the Baath
Party or the vast internal-security network. A Romania-style
popular outburst also is unlikely since centers of unrest in
the country have been smashed. The two best-organized
resistance groups, the Kurds in the north and the radical
Shiites, have been all but vanquished: the Kurds by chemical
warfare and resettlement, and the radical Shiites by
execution and mass deportation to Iran. Iraq is a majority
Shiite country, led chiefly by a Sunni minority, which
includes Saddam Hussein.
   Unlike last year's revolutionaries in Eastern Europe,
Iraqis have little information to fan the sparks of
resistance. Shortwave broadcasts into the country are jammed,
Western publications are unavailable and photocopy centers
keep copies of customers' copies. A move that stuns the
outside world, such as Iraq's sudden capitulation to Iran's
peace terms, can be sold at home in whatever packaging the
government cares to design.
   In the end, Arab analysts insist that Saddam Hussein's
"nakwa" -- his Bedouin honor -- won't allow him to back down
in the crisis. They believe that, if defeated, he likely
would choose death by his own hand, after unleashing as much
destruction as possible on his enemies.
   However his end comes, Saddam Hussein's legacy is likely
to make a mockery of the Baathist dream of Arab unity to
which he has dedicated his life. Just as his occupation of
Kuwait has split the Arab world, his failure to anoint a
successor could tear Iraq apart: With no Saddam Hussein to
fear, his tough, ruthless underlings would battle each other
for power.
   That scenario recalls the epilogue of another warlord who
perished on Iraqi soil. Alexander the Great dreamed of
uniting his conquests, from Athens to Persia. As he lay dying
of fever in Babylon, his generals gathered to ask to whom his
crown should pass. His whispered reply -- "To the strongest"
-- set off a series of wars and feuds that, within a few
years, had reduced his dream of unity to dust and rubble.
