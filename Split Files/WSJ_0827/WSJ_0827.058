   Mexico has found a solution to its smugglers problem: free
trade. The Associated Press reports that the dropping of
Mexico's trade barriers has transformed Tepito, Mexico City's
400-year-old smugglers' market. Electronic goods are now
offered at cut-rate prices in stores with names like Super
Gringo. A five-story shopping center and parking garage are
under construction. The market's president, Miguel Galan,
says Tepito went upscale after vendors "realized it was
easier to pay taxes than to make payoffs." By bringing the
underground economy to the surface, free trade promises to
lift many Mexicans out of poverty at the same time the
government reaps a revenue windfall.
