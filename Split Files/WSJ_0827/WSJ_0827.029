   SYDNEY, Australia -- OTC Ltd., Australia's
government-owned international telecommunications company,
said it received a 10-year contract valued at more than 250
million Australian dollars (US$208.4 million) to help Vietnam
develop and manage its international telecommunications
network.
   OTC already is involved in Vietnam through a contract
signed in 1988 to build satellite earth stations. Under the
new contract, OTC will construct two digital international
telephone exchanges in Vietnam, invest in domestic
telecommunications projects and train local staff.
