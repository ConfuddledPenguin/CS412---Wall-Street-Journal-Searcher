   "First, the obvious starting point is the recognition that
we no longer live in what is described as Pax Americana. At a
time when the maintenance of order under Pax Americana was
the rule of the game, the order in the system was maintained
primarily through the leadership of the United States. In
such a situation, in both the political and the economic
domains, the United States tended to practice what might be
termed as `unilateral globalism.' The United States was in
effect managing the international system through maintaining
a universally acceptable order through unilateral leadership.
With the arrival of diffusion of power, however, that is no
longer possible."
   -- Hisashi Owada, deputy foreign minister of Japan, in a
speech delivered at the Seventh International Lisbon
Conference on European Security in a Multipolar World, Nov.
8, 1989.

   Oh well, we all make mistakes, especially when we peer
into the future. How could the thoughtful and able Mr. Owada
have foreseen that just nine months after his speech, the
world would again be relying on Pax Americana to get itself
out of a jam? When Iraq's Saddam Hussein grabbed Kuwait and
menaced Saudi Arabia, seeking effective control over 40% of
the West's oil supply, there was little question about who
would exercise unilateral leadership. It had to be George
Bush, President of the United States.
   I cite Mr. Owada's words not to embarrass him or to
reassert U.S. global hegemony, but to make another point:
News of the demise of military power as a factor in global
politics was decidedly premature. Mr. Owada certainly was not
the only one mistaken. The idea had become quite fashionable
that economic power, not military might, would be the most
important way of wielding global influence in the enlightened
1990s. Up until Aug. 2.
   That thesis had accorded Japan a major world role simply
because of the success of its corporations in operating on a
global scale. Toyota, Sony and all those other familiar
Japanese brand names have penetrated deeply into markets
everywhere. Dollars have piled up for the Bank of Japan and
in private accounts at a phenomenal rate. That wealth has
been reinvested in real assets around the globe, earning
Japan admiration but also resentment in some places, the U.S.
in particular.
   But now the Persian Gulf conflict has sharply boosted the
price of oil, an import vital to Japan's awesome industrial
machine. But Japan, that putative world power, has been
mainly on the sidelines. At the urging of George Bush, Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu signed on to the UN embargo of
Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil. That was an advance from the 1979 U.S.-EC
embargo against Iran during the hostage crisis, when Japan
only provided some lip service. But the U.S. is pressing
Japan to do much more. Pressure will rise after Congress
returns from recess.
   Japan was getting some 12% of its oil from Iraq and
Kuwait. It could be argued that using Japanese self-defense
forces to safeguard those supplies might be legitimate under
Japan's legal ban on their use for offensive purposes. Its
120-odd F-15s are primarily air superiority fighters, more
adapted to defensive use than attack. Its 57 frigates also
are primarily defensive, useful for protecting carriers and
other vessels against air or naval attack. Japan surely will
offer financial aid, but direct intervention is being debated
intensely in Tokyo.
   Japan bashers in the United States and Europe, with a
large head of resentment steam already, quite likely will
find cause for further bashing. But there will be some
ambivalence. Do those who still are suspicious of Japan,
nearly 50 years after Pearl Harbor and the Japanese conquest
of British and French holdings in Southeast Asia, want Japan
to become a global military power as well as an economic
titan? Do they really want Japan to slip the ties of its
security treaty with the U.S.? In short, do they really want
the end of Pax Americana to become a reality, with global
political power as well as economic power widely dispersed?
That would mean a genuine "triad," three independently
powerful blocs, the U.S., Japan and a Europe dominated by yet
another economic powerhouse, Germany. The Soviet Union, of
course, remains a major military power as well, despite its
troubles.
   Clearly, Bush administration officials have thought about
this. In June, the U.S. had a key role in organizing a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Knokke, Belgium, with
a special objective. It aimed at pulling Japan and NATO
together into a closer global security alliance. The theme
was, "North American, European and Japanese Interdependence
in the 1990s."
   It was almost as if the U.S. and NATO had anticipated
Saddam Hussein. But he struck well before anything resembling
an effective working alliance had been formed to deal with
such problems as the Kuwait grab. NATO had traditionally
shunned what it called "out-of-area" involvements, despite
longstanding U.S. urging that Europe take a broader view.
Similarly, Japan had been reluctant to involve itself outside
a perimeter surrounding its own islands, although it has
enlarged that perimeter.
   Yet Paul Wolfowitz, U.S. undersecretary of defense for
policy, could do some cheerleading to the Knokke gathering.
He said that the coalition had in fact made progress in
pulling together for the defense of the Persian Gulf, an area
with threequarters of the world's proven oil reserves. Citing
the effort to protect shipping in the Gulf during the
Iran-Iraq war -- an endeavor dubbed Operation Earnest by the
U.S. -- Mr. Wolfowitz said the U.S. had provided "carrier and
conventional naval forces. Our European allies, operating
under the umbrella of the Western European Union, provided
naval forces and particularly minesweepers. And Japan
provided financial resources."
   Well, financial resources are not nothing. Japan has
granted significant aid to Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey, all
three of which quickly allied themselves with the U.S. in the
effort to bring down Hussein. Japan will get U.S. pressure to
provide still more financial support to help maintain
military forces in the Gulf region.
   Yet some experts think Japan has little choice but to
become more engaged in the world's military problems as well.
That was the view of Fred Ikle, undersecretary of defense for
policy in the Reagan administration, and Terumasa Nakanishi
of the Research Institute for Peace and Security in Tokyo, in
a provocative article in the summer issue of Foreign Affairs.
"It seems unlikely that Japan's body politic would remain
content through the end of this decade to see the nation a
mere bystander on matters that affect the strategic order of
the world," they wrote. Well, Mr. Owada was premature, and
these two intelligent men may be as well. We will know more
after events in the Gulf play themselves out.
