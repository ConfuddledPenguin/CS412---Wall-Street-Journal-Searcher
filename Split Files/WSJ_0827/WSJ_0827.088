   Data General Corp. could become profitable in as little as
six months as the savings from a sweeping 17% work-force
reduction hit the bottom line, some analysts say.

   The Westborough, Mass., minicomputer maker said Friday
that it would lay off at least an additional 2,000 people and
take a $70 million charge in the fiscal fourth quarter,
ending Sept. 29. It's the latest move in a bold gamble to
transform the troubled company into a smaller, nimbler
competitor in the booming workstation business.
   "This gives them a fighting chance," says Marc Schulman,
an analyst at UBS Securities Inc. in New York. "Cutting this
deeply, as painful as it is, is Data General's only shot at
becoming profitable quickly. And that's the only way it's
going to survive."
   Mr. Schulman estimates quarterly savings could be more
than 70 cents a share, enough to reverse recent operating
losses. He sees a return to profitability in the second
quarter, ending March 30, and expects fiscal 1991 to bring
the first annual profit in five years.
   In the latest nine months, Data General had a loss of
$50.5 million, or $1.69 a share, on revenue of $907.9
million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $35.7 million,
or $1.22 a share, on revenue of $957.3 million.
   Data General is engaged in a delicate balancing act,
trying to hold onto existing customers of its aging MV
minicomputer line while increasing sales of its Aviion line
of workstations and computer network servers. While the new
line has been well-received and is expected to hit $100
million in sales this year, competition from larger,
healthier companies has become more intense while sales of
the MV are dropping. Total revenue, which hit $1.36 billion
in 1988, are expected to fall to an estimated $1.23 billion
this year.
   Still, the company has slashed expenses so deeply that
"even assuming that revenue continues to slip a little bit
each quarter, Data General should be profitable again next
year," says Shao F. Wang, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. John Adams of Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill adds that
the balance sheet remains relatively strong and should
provide a cushion for another year.
   The cuts announced Friday will bring the payroll to fewer
than 9,700, down from 11,700 on June 30 and a peak of 17,700
in 1985.
   The layoffs are another blow to the state's ebbing economy
and to the Route 128 region, once considered the East Coast's
answer to California's booming Silicon Valley. Data General's
troubles are echoed at nearby Wang Laboratories Inc. and
Prime Computer Inc., which remain mired in losses. Even giant
Digital Equipment Corp., the largest employer in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, has been struggling and
posted its first-ever loss last month.
   In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Friday,
Data General shares closed at $6, up 25 cents.
