   BEAVER, Pa. -- From the back seat of the late-model
Lincoln, Rep. Joe Kolter leans forward with an apology. "The
reason we're driving slow," he explains, "is we're always
getting picked up by the state police. I have four points
right now."
   The husky, white-haired Mr. Kolter is no stranger to life
in the slow lane. Little known outside this western
Pennsylvania district, the four-term Democrat has never won
passage of a major bill and is generally regarded as a
legislative lightweight. He is little involved in the
pressing issues of the day, such as the budget, and his
occasional political missteps and penchant for verbal
stumbles -- "Some of the people taking over defunct S&amp;Ls are
people who have defuncted themselves," he said recently --
are a source of amusement both here and in Washington.
   On paper, he ought to be susceptible to challenge. Though
Democrats hold an edge in registration, his district voted
for Ronald Reagan in 1980, gave George Bush 45% in 1988 and,
in fact, was designed after the 1980 census especially to
elect a Republican who had recently converted from being a
Democrat, Rep. Eugene Atkinson. Republicans also hold several
local offices.
   Yet Mr. Kolter is a solid favorite to win re-election this
year. His underfinanced GOP opponent, a chemistry professor
at a Pennsylvania State University branch campus here, lost
to him two years ago and this year has been unable to raise
any money from political-action committees.
   The story of Rep. Kolter's longevity is a parable of the
power of incumbency. In recent election years, more than 90%
of the House incumbents who ran won, and this year isn't
expected to be much different, even if anti-Washington
feeling is on the rise. Even lackluster legislators are
greatly advantaged by the routine perks of their office.
   In Mr. Kolter's case, that means consistently bringing
home the bacon in the form of federal "pork barrel" projects.
His particular plus is his seat on the House Public Works
Committee. From that position, he has obtained funds to
improve almost every airport in his district, to establish a
new post office in one of his most Republican communities,
and to construct part of a highway that someday may traverse
his entire district.
   "Highways and airports are very important to me because I
know they create jobs," he says proudly. "These are jobs I am
able to provide through my assignment."
   Over the years, Mr. Kolter has been dogged about getting
federal money for the folks back home. "You cannot accept
`no' for an answer," he says, and his colleagues agree that
he rarely does. "He works very hard," says Democratic Rep.
Robert Borski, a fellow Pennsylvanian who serves with him on
the Public Works Committee.
   Despite severe spending constraints during his tenure in
Washington, Mr. Kolter has won funds for airports in Beaver,
Butler and Lawrence counties, the Jimmy Stewart Airport in
Indiana County and the promise of funds for an airport in
Armstrong County, "the site of which has not even been
decided," he says. He also procured money for an armory in
Butler County and a highway bypass around the heavily
Republican town of Ligonier.
   Like other careful incumbents, he also devotes enormous
energy and resources to helping constituents on a personal
level. He has five district offices that house 11 caseworkers
-- a more far-flung system than many larger districts have.
In addition, Mr. Kolter goes home almost every weekend to
make himself available to the voters. "He's got an
exceptionally strong constituent-service operation," says
Rep. Thomas Ridge, a Republican whose district adjoins Mr.
Kolter's. "That's tough to beat."
   Here in Beaver this dreary day, Rep. Kolter is busy
pursuing more jobs by playing host to a powerful Public Works
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Norman Mineta (D., Calif.). Mr.
Kolter wants to persuade him to finance a new four-lane
highway. As an inducement, he treats Mr. Mineta to a briefing
on the project replete with multicolored maps at a local
engineering firm, to a luncheon with local business
executives at a country club, and to an overland tour of the
winding country road he wishes to replace.
   During the tour, Mr. Mineta falls asleep in the front
seat. But Mr. Kolter is undaunted. "Norman]" Mr. Kolter
shouts to rouse him. "We're getting to Cranberry Township
now]" Rep. Mineta regains consciousness and his composure
but, by the end of the day, is still uncommitted to the $150
million proposal.
   Even less impressed is the Beaver County Times. "Only
those with the hardest of hearts could resist the urge to
laugh at U.S. Rep. Joe Kolter's election-year proposal," its
editorial states. "Instead of waxing eloquently and hollowly
about this fantasy road and bridge project in a never-never
land future, Kolter should be telling voters how he would cut
the deficit, not add to it."
   Mr. Kolter's Republican opponent would like to cast Mr.
Kolter, who is 63 years old, as a person who is prone to
making missteps. "I am going to attack his competency," says
Republican Gordon Johnston, the 62-year-old professor who is
running against him. "I don't think he's as aware of the
issues as he really should be."
   To make his point, Mr. Johnston hopes to use such examples
as the time three years ago when, in a television broadcast,
Rep. Kolter confused the U.S.-backed Contras with the
Communist Sandinistas. "The Contras are a pure Communist
group," Mr. Kolter said. He also misidentified the Contra
organization, UNO, as an individual rather than a group.
   That same year Mr. Kolter made an error that cost him one
of his coveted construction projects. Against the wishes of
Mr. Mineta, Mr. Kolter compiled a list of $200 million in
airport projects that lawmakers wanted for their districts,
including one for his own. Mr. Mineta thwarted Mr. Kolter's
effort to attach the list to an aviation bill.
   Last year, another Kolter project was axed when, despite a
clear warning from a fellow lawmaker, Rep. Kolter again
defied a senior colleague. Against the wishes of Rep. William
Lehman (D., Fla.), an appropriations subcommittee chairman,
Mr. Kolter voted for a motion to increase Coast Guard
spending. Mr. Lehman considered the vote an affront to his
authority, and cut out the projects of those who voted
against him, including Mr. Kolter.
   Mr. Kolter continues to make mistakes of protocol. During
his presentation at Beaver, he disparages an alternative
route for his hoped-for highway because it would run through
another district. "Let some congressman from Allegheny County
support that," he sniffs. He also confesses envy of a fellow
Pennsylvania lawmaker who is the senior Republican on the
Public Works Committee, Rep. Bud Shuster. "All he has are
four-lane highways over there," he says.
   Still, Mr. Kolter bridles at any suggestion that he is
less than capable. "I have four children, two of whom I
taught well," he protests. "They're medical doctors."
   Another politician ought to be able to make a credible
campaign against Mr. Kolter. During his eight years in
office, his district, which is northwest of Pittsburgh, has
continued to stagnate economically, unable to rebound from
the devastating job losses that befell the steel industry.
Mr. Kolter has frequently feuded with senior members of his
own party. And, from the Republican side, the district was
drawn in 1982 to give party-switching Rep. Atkinson a chance
to win re-election as a Republican. But Mr. Kolter beat Mr.
Atkinson that year by a margin of 3-2, and no challenger has
done much better since.
   "I'm a politician," Mr. Kolter explains. "I say the right
things at the right time to the right people." But more
importantly, he adds, "I bring things back to my district
that it really needs; that's why I'm successful."
