   West Germany's ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG said Friday that
it expects to boost world-wide group sales by 11% in 1990
from the previous year to around 12 billion Deutsche marks,
accompanied by "considerably higher" pretax operating
earnings.
   The Saarbrucken-based retailing group's Chairman Helmut
Wagner told shareholders at the annual meeting that besides
strong sales and earnings developments of the underlying
businesses thus far this year, the ongoing corporate
reorganization has been improving the company's overall
profitability.

   Mr. Wagner wasn't more specific about 1990 full-year
earnings, although he had told reporters in July that ASKO's
operating earnings in the first five months of this year were
"considerably higher" than the year-earlier period.
   In 1989, ASKO had profit of 91 million marks on 10.6
billion marks of sales. The company hasn't yet reported
complete financial details for last year.
