   IRVINE, Calif. -- Wet Seal Inc., a specialty retailer that
went public last month, said that second-quarter net income
nearly doubled to $2.3 million, or 22 cents a share, on a 54%
sales increase.
   In the comparable quarter ended July 29, 1989, the
specialty retailer had net of $1.2 million, or 13 cents a
share. Sales in the latest quarter rose to $27.7 million from

   Wet Seal said the results reflected strong sales in its
mature stores as well as in seven new stores that opened in
the retailer's fiscal first half in California, Hawaii and
Arizona. In addition, the company has opened six stores this
month, including three in Florida, and plans to open seven
more this year.
   Wet Seal said it had 80 stores at the end of the quarter,
compared with 68 a year earlier. The recent openings bring
the total number of stores to 86. In national
over-the-counter trading Friday, Wet Seal's shares rose $1.50
to close at $13.75.
