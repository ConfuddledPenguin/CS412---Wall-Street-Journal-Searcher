   PRINCETON, N.J. -- Fang Lizhi, 54-year-old Chinese
astrophysicist and exiled dissident, will join Princeton
University's astrophysics faculty next year.
   Mr. Fang -- one of China's most famous dissidents and a
leader of the democracy movement there -- is currently a
professor at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, a
post he has held since he was permitted to leave the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing last month.

   Mr. Fang will move to Princeton after spending one term,
starting Jan. 1, at the nearby Institute of Advanced Studies
as a visiting scholar.
