   American Airlines -- $238.9 million of equipment trust
certificates through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets. The 25-part issue, with maturities ranging
from 2 1/2 to 24 1/2 years, was priced with yields varying
from 8.75% to 10.68%. The certificates were priced at spreads
ranging from 63 basis points to 160 basis points above
comparable Treasury issues. The certificates are secured by
three McDonnell Douglas DC-9-82 aircraft and five Boeing
757-223 aircraft. According to the preliminary prospectus,
American Airlines, a subsidiary of AMR Corp., leases the
aircraft from an owner-trustee, Wilmington Trust Co. Although
the certificates are not direct obligations of American
Airlines, the lease provides that the payments American makes
to lease the aircraft together with certain other payments by
the airline will go toward interest and principal payments on
the certificates.

   Merrill Lynch Trust 45 -- $510 million of Remic mortgage

term to maturity of 26.67 years. Among classes for which
