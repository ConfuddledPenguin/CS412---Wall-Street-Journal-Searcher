   WASHINGTON -- President Bush met with his top economic
advisers to discuss the fiscal 1991 budget in light of recent
events in the Persian Gulf, administration officials said.
   The meeting, which included Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Budget Director Richard Darman and White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu, focused on the proposed mix of spending
cuts for fiscal 1991, when the administration is pledged to
shrink the federal deficit by $50 billion. It is widely
expected that cuts in defense spending may now be smaller
than originally planned because of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait and the subsequent deployment of U.S. forces in the
region.

   "It was a planning session, they're going to be getting
together later, in September," an administration official
said after the meeting, which was held in Kennebunkport,
Maine, where the president is spending his summer vacation.
   "The administration remains firm and resolute that a
budget agreement is critical," this official said, adding
that the proposed $50 billion of savings for fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1, is "still a fairly firm number."
   Meanwhile, President Bush signed the paperwork needed to
authorize the Office of Management and Budget to carry out
the automatic spending cuts required under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction act. The presidential order specifies that
the automatic spending restraints take effect Oct. 1.
