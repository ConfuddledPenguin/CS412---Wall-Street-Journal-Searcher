   LONDON -- Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB of Sweden, a pulp
and paper maker, said it plans to sell its Finess AB unit, a
tissues and paper napkin maker with annual sales of about 2.2
billion kronor ($385.2 million). An asking price wasn't
disclosed but an analyst estimated 1.6 billion kronor as
likely.
   Stora said it will provide more detailed information on
Sept. 6, following a board meeting.
