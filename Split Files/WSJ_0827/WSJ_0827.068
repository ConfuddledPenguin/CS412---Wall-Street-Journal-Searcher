   TOKYO -- Pioneer Electronic Corp. said it signed an
agreement with International Business Machines Corp. under
which IBM will market Pioneer's laser disk players to
corporate clients in the U.S.
   The Japanese company said its Pioneer Communications of
America Inc. subsidiary will provide industrial disk players
to hook up with IBM computers. IBM will adapt its graphics
software to operate on Pioneer's machines.

   The laser disk units can provide programs that interact
with the user by sound as well as by screen. Pioneer hopes to
provide its players programs for schools and for showrooms.
   While Pioneer is the leading maker of disk players, about
95% of its sales until now have been for home use -- mainly
for laser-disk movies. With IBM's software technology,
Pioneer hopes to make greater inroads in the industrial
market.
   A Pioneer spokesman declined to estimate how much sales
the agreement with IBM might generate. The industrial
machines range in price from $1,000 to $2,800, he said.
   Pioneer last year sold 100,000 laser-disk players to U.S.
consumers, giving it about 70% of the U.S. market, according
to the spokesman. The consumer units sell for around $600.
   In Japan last year Pioneer sold 700,000 laser-disk
players, including household and industrial units, and the
company hopes to increase the total to 1.2 million this year.
The company has about a 50% share of the market for consumer
units in Japan, the spokesman said.
