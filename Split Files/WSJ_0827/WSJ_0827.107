   After three weeks of saber rattling, the Bush
administration began signaling that with economic sanctions
now in place it is willing to look for a diplomatic way out
of its standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Tensions also eased somewhat in the Mideast over the
weekend, as Iraq reversed its decision and permitted 55 U.S.
diplomatic dependents who had traveled to Baghdad from Kuwait
to leave Iraq. The Associated Press reported that 52 members
of the group crossed into Turkey last night. Three male
dependents of Kuwait Embassy staffers reportedly were
detained by Iraqi border guards. Iraqi troops also didn't
make any move to oust the U.S. diplomats remaining in the
beseiged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City.

   But the potential for confrontation still remains. The
United Nations Security Council over the weekend authorized
the world's navies to use force to put teeth in the trade
embargo against Iraq. (However, the Soviet Union, which had
supported the resolution, said it wouldn't use force.) And 54
male U.S. diplomatic personnel, who had left Kuwait for Iraq,
were in the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and not allowed to leave
Iraq.
   Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security
adviser, said yesterday on ABC-TV's "This Week with David
Brinkley" that it would be "clearly acceptable" for United
Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to begin
efforts to negotiate an end to the crisis. The U.N. official
also got a green light over the weekend from Saddam Hussein,
who welcomed the U.N. call for negotiations. The U.N. chief
reportedly will meet with Iraq's foreign minister in Jordan
Thursday.
   Mr. Scowcroft, who refrained from making the harsh
personal attacks on Iraq's Hussein made earlier by President
Bush, reiterated that Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait, restore
its government and free foreigners being held hostage. But he
also began laying some domestic political groundwork to
justify the military buildup by asserting that if a
settlement is reached, the U.S. would have gotten more for
its display of military muscle than just a return to the
status quo.
   "There will still be a fundamentally different situation
in that area, in that collective action will have been shown
to work against a case of aggression," he said. "And,
therefore, the situation will not be the same afterwards."
Earlier, administration officials had given the impression
that Saddam Hussein must go.
   The public signals reflect a private belief of the
administration that it isn't necessary, or perhaps even
desirable, to use the current crisis to push out Saddam
Hussein. The Bush administration isn't sure that any
successor would be better; indeed, Saddam Hussein's top
deputy, Taha Yassin Ramadan, is known to be equally tough,
and many of the top officers who fought in the war with Iran
also are hardline.
   The U.S. shift in tone reflects an assessment by
administration officials that Saddam Hussein is squirming as
a result of the big American military buildup and U.N.-backed
embargo. While administration officials spent the past three
weeks comparing Saddam Hussein to Hitler, Mr. Scowcroft
yesterday seemed to be appealing to his sense of reason.
   "The course of prudence for a leader in this situation,"
Mr. Scowcroft said, referring to the squeeze on Iraq, would
be to give in to U.S. demands and begin negotiations. And,
noting that Saddam Hussein recently agreed to a settlement
with Iran that gave up all he had won in the Iran-Iraq war,
Mr. Scowcroft said: "He's shown that he can be a realist when
it needs to be done."
   Mr. Scowcroft said he believes that Saddam Hussein "is
casting about for a way out of the box in which he finds
himself." The national security adviser also said that once
Iraq met the U.S. requirements, any grievances between Kuwait
and Iraq that led to the invasion in the first place could be
negotiated.
   John Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for the
Mideast, underscored that the U.S. is willing to talk to
Iraq. Yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press," he said the senior
U.S. diplomat currently in Baghdad "has been talking to the
Iraqis" and is willing to continue to hold talks. The
administration also is signaling privately that it is willing
to hold talks at a higher level.
   The administration still calculates that diplomacy won't
succeed unless economic sanctions continue to squeeze Iraq.
And in pursuit of that goal, the U.S. is likely to begin
stopping, boarding and possibly even firing on Iraqi ships in
the next few days. The Bush administration had been holding
off on full-scale naval interdiction awaiting passage of the
U.N. resolution explicitly authorizing use of naval force to
enforce the trade embargo.
   The Arabian peninsula country of Yemen could be a focal
point as the U.S. steps up its naval interdiction efforts.
The administration believes that Iraq had hoped to use Yemen
as a trans-shipment point for its oil to circumvent the trade
embargo, sending oil tankers there to unload oil that then
could be intermingled with other oil and shipped to the world
markets anonymously.
   Under pressure from the U.S. and other nations, Yemen last
week forced an Iraqi tanker that was unloading to leave port
with half of its oil still on board, and then refused entry
to a second tanker at which the U.S. Navy had fired warning
shots. Over the weekend, there were at least three other
tankers destined for Yemen. U.S. officials will be watching
closely to see whether Yemen keeps its word to honor the
embargo.
   If ships believed to be carrying Iraqi cargo try to elude
U.S. ships, American naval commanders intend to fire at the
ships' rudders to disable them. But in the case of oil
tankers, the ships sometimes are floating so low in the water
that the rudder isn't visible, and captains are likely to
disable such ships by firing at the bridge or at the cables
linking the bridge to the rudder.
   The U.S. is hoping these pressures will take their toll on
Iraq. Although administration officials remain intrigued by
the notion of using the current crisis to knock out Iraq's
chemical-weapons and nuclear programs, they worry that they
may get trapped in a prolonged and unpredictable conflict by
pursuing such broader goals rather than the short-term goal
of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait.
   It isn't clear, though, that others in the U.S. or the
Middle East would share the administration's view that such a
limited outcome would be a success. Some of America's best
friends in the region -- particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia
-- want the U.S. to remove Saddam Hussein from power, and
some American analysts suggest that any arrangement that is
seen as a draw between Iraq and the U.S. will erode U.S.
credibility in the long run.
   Yesterday, Mr. Kelly suggested the hope that if the U.S.
keeps up the pressure, opposition to Saddam Hussein may begin
to develop even in Iraq's repressive society. Referring to
Hussein's leading Iraq into the Iran-Iraq war, which ended
without gain, and the Kuwait invasion, which has brought
world condemnation, Mr. Kelly said Iraqis "must be wondering
where he's taking them."
   If the conflict ends short of an all-out war,
administration officials envision a scenario in which a
United Nations force guards the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border,
significant stockpiles of American military equipment are
left in Saudi Arabia for use in any future emergency, some
American airmen remain based permanently in Saudi Arabia, and
the U.S. assumes a bigger explicit role in protecting other
Gulf countries.
