   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. cut its ratings
on $1.5 billion of USG Corp. long-term debt, saying in part
that the crisis in the Middle East is likely to reduce
housing starts and hurt the company's gypsum wallboard
business.
   The rating agency also cited "the prospect of continued
low prices for gypsum wallboard and the rigor of the
company's debt amortization schedule." It noted that USG is
currently operating at "about break-even" because of
depressed gypsum prices and high interest expenses.

   Moody's said it expects that USG will be forced to
renegotiate its bank covenants and supplement operating cash
flow to meet interest and principal payments. Moody's said it
believes the company's $200 million revolving credit facility
should enable it to service its debt over the next year. But
with previously projected asset sales virtually complete,
Moody's said USG may be under pressure to sell additional
assets and to come up with alternative financing sources on
"an ongoing basis."
   The agency cut its rating to single-B-2 from single-B-1 on
the senior secured debt of USG's United States Gypsum Co.
unit. The agency also reduced its rating on USG senior debt
to single-B-3 from single-B-1 and on USG subordinated
debentures to single-B-3 from single-B-2.
