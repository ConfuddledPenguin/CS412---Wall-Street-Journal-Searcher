   LONDON -- Laura Ashley PLC, a clothing and home
furnishings concern, said its chief executive officer, John
James, will resign on Saturday.
   A spokesman said that Mr. James's departure was amicable,
and that the executive's plans weren't known.

   Mr. James's post will be assumed temporarily by Mike
Smith, chairman of Laura Ashley's British retail operations.
Laura Ashley said it intends to seek a successor from outside
the company.
   Laura Ashley, which expanded rapidly overseas in the past
decade, had a #4.6 million ($9 million) pretax loss in the
year ended Jan. 27, a reversal from year-earlier pretax
profit of #20.3 million, despite an 18% rise in sales to
#296.6 million.
   The company experienced a sharp decline in several sectors
of its important domestic and U.S. markets, and introduced a
line of furniture in Britain just as the local housing market
entered a slump.
   Mr. James, who joined Laura Ashley in 1974 when its sales
stood at #2 million a year, was widely criticized by analysts
as the fortunes of the company soured in the past year. "The
business has now outgrown him," said Richard Ratner of Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken, a London stockbrokerage firm.
