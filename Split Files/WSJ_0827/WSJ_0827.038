   HAFAR AL BATIN, Saudi Arabia -- A relatively small but
strategically placed Arab force has moved into position near
here to form the first line of defense against any Iraqi
assault.
   The Saudi army's elite "Peninsula Shield" division, along
with thousands of Egyptian and Moroccan troops, now guard the
main desert and coastal approach routes from the desolate
Kuwaiti frontier. The first group of Syrian soldiers has been
deployed near a section of the border closer to the coast,
and even the tiny Persian Gulf sheikdoms of Bahrain, Qatar
and Oman are deploying troops at the urging of the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia.

   But behind this tripwire of Arab soldiers about 20 miles
from the Iraqi border, U.S. commanders are marshaling their
formidable forces for what is likely to be a different kind
of battle in the next few days and perhaps weeks.
   As part of a calculated, psychological test of wills with
Saddam Hussein, American forces are trying to intimidate the
Iraqi military and its leadership, according to U.S. and
Saudi officials. U.S. officers are jamming ground
communications, challenging Iraqi fighter pilots in the air
through long-range warnings, and sending out wide-ranging
patrols of Apache helicopters with laser-guided missiles.
   Keeping heavily armed American units well back from the
skirmish line along the border, according to these officials,
is part of a broader strategy intended to destroy Saddam
Hussein's standing in the Arab world if he launches any kind
of attack and injures Arabs in the multinational force. The
plan also ensures that U.S. forces retain maximum flexibility
to take defensive or offensive action.
   Meanwhile, the long-awaited arrival of the ships carrying
the most deadly U.S. tanks, the Army's M-1 models, means they
will reach the field in the next few days. And the general in
charge of supplying the rapidly expanding U.S. army here with
everything from weapons and fuel to candy and shaving cream
told reporters that his operation has mushroomed into
"probably the largest logistical exercise ever accomplished
in a short period of time since the end of World War II."
   The buildup of heavy ground forces accelerated over the
weekend as the first troops from the Army's 24th Mechanized
Infantry Division based at Fort Stewart, Ga., stepped off a
chartered Pan Am jumbo jet. Their M-1 tanks and Bradley
Fighting Vehicles will substantially increase the heavy armor
in Saudi Arabia and plug an important gap in the makeup of
U.S. forces here.
   Providing the most detailed breakdown so far of the
12,000-mile supply trail sustaining Operation Desert Shield,
Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis said the Saudi government has been
giving free fuel, water, food, buses, trucks and even
military barracks to American troops. "They will give us
anything they have without any hesitation," he said.
   Right on the border, the Saudis appear to have only rifle
and pistol-toting border guards, backed up by a couple of
pickup trucks equipped with makeshift machine guns. Guards in
flowing white robes and turbans listlessly lean against
rundown posts surrounded by garbage and abandoned vehicles. A
gnarled man wore a shiny black bandoleer and waved a World
War I-era bolt-action Enfield rifle. Fourwheel-drive trucks
slowly patrol sections where an ordinary chain link fence
marks the edge of a three-mile-wide no man's land between
Saudi and Iraqi territory.
   Not too far to the southwest, the multinational forces are
digging in to defend what would be a natural highway for
Iraqi tanks if fighting breaks out.
   The first group of Western journalists to visit the Arab
force taking shape in the hard-packed, pancake-flat desert
saw a scene straight out of a Middle East adventure novel.
Standing in a large tent with an Oriental carpet on the
ground and gold-colored cloth lining the inside, Col.
Abdurahim Mohammed al Said, the commander of a battalion of
Saudi M-60 tanks, described the morale of his men. "For them,
it is a question of victory or martyrdom," he said.
   Instead of a map, Col. Said used a box filled with sand to
explain why his battalion was blocking one end of a wide
valley. A grid of black and green strings showed distances
and the route of the nearest highway. A deep gouge in the
surface represented the valley. Pink flags stuck in the sand
marked the location of Saudi units.
   Brig. Gen. Mohammed A. Shehri, the chief supply officer
for the division, described the Saudi military's reaction to
Saddam Hussein more bluntly. "We are not going to give this
crazy man a singe meter of (our) land. He will have to go
over us."
