   WASHINGTON -- The economy wasn't quite as bad off in the
second quarter as the government originally estimated,
although overall growth was just as weak.
   After reviewing new data, the Commerce Department made
minor revisions to its calculation of the second-quarter real
gross national product -- the market value of all the goods
and services the economy produced, adjusted for inflation --
showing that personal spending and exports during the period
were stronger than originally estimated. Business
inventories, the new data showed, were smaller.

   While this made a healthier mix of economic factors, the
bottom line was the same: Real GNP rose at a 1.2% annual rate
in the second quarter, the same as the department first
estimated. That trailed the 1.7% growth rate in the first
quarter of the year, and marked the fifth quarter in a row of
a growth rate under 2%.
   During the latest three-month period, after-tax corporate
profits slipped 0.2%, the department reported in its first
calculation of earnings for the quarter. It was the first
decline in that category since the fourth quarter of 1989.
   But profits from current production, or earnings adjusted
for changes in the value of inventories and depreciation of
capital, rose 3.3% after growing 2% in the first quarter and
falling 5.2% in the fourth quarter. This measure is
considered by some analysts to be a better gauge of corporate
financial health than after-tax profits.
   The revised GNP figures still show that the economy was in
a precarious position even before the Middle East oil crisis
cast a further pall on the economic outlook. As in its
initial report, the government still said most major segments
of private economic activity declined in the second quarter,
including construction, business investment and exports.
   Personal consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds
of the country's economic activity, did increase slightly,
however, the department said after examining new information.
It grew at a $2 billion annual rate, instead of dropping at a
$2.1 billion pace as the department initially estimated.
   The department also cut its estimate of the second-quarter
decline in exports almost in half, to a $5.6 billion rate,
instead of $11.1 billion.
   The government will revise the second-quarter GNP figures
a final time next month.
   All the figures are adjusted for seasonal changes.
